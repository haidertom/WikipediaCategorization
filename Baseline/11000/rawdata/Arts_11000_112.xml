==Summary==
On January 18, 1989, [[Baptist minister]] Don Piper was on his way home from a conference in [[Texas]] when a [[semi-trailer truck]] struck his [[Ford Taurus]] while crossing a bridge. Piper describes that he was crushed by the roof of his car, the steering wheel impaled his chest, and the dashboard collapsed on his legs. When [[paramedics]] arrived, they could not find any sign of life in Piper and covered him with a tarp as a fellow pastor prayed over him while waiting for the [[medical examiner]] to arrive.&lt;ref name="Inbar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/33055601|title=New study: What really happens when you die?|last=Inbar|first=Michael|date=2009-09-28|work=TODAY: Health|publisher=msnbc.com|accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Piper, he went straight to [[Heaven]] and experienced things he describes as amazing and beautiful, including meeting family members such as his great-grandmother and joining a Heavenly Choir that proceeded into the Gates of Heaven. Piper, an ordained minister since 1985, has recounted his narrative before 3,000 live audiences that included more than 1.5 million people altogether.&lt;ref name=cr/&gt; and appeared on numerous television and radio programs.&lt;ref name="Inbar"/&gt;

'''''A Long Way Home''''' is a non-fiction book by Indian-Australian businessman [[Saroo Brierley]] written together with [[Larry Buttrose]]. The text was initially released in Australia on 24 June 2013 via [[Penguin Books|Viking]], then re-released internationally in 2014, and adapted into a major film in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Long Way Home |url=https://www.bookdepository.com/Long-Way-Home-Saroo-Brierley/9780670077045 |publisher=[[Book Depository]] |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carroll |first1=Rory |title=Saroo Brierley, the inspiration for the film Lion: 'My mother saw my face after 25 years' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/24/saroo-brierley-lion-oscars-interview |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=15 October 2018 |date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that Brierley currently writes a prequel to ''A Long Way Home'', “the story of both my mothers – biological and adoptive – before I was in the picture.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Iyer |first1=Archana |title=Lion: Saroo Brierley’s next book to be a prequel to A Long Way Home |url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/lion-saroo-brierleys-next-book-to-be-a-prequel-to-a-long-way-home/articleshow/56937194.cms |website=[[Mumbai Mirror]] |accessdate=15 October 2018 |date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
In this authobiographical book, Brierley covers three decades of his life, describing his ordeals and adventures as a lost five-year-old in rural India, his adoption by a wealthy Australian family, and his search for his Indian native family some 25 years later.

In an interview to [[ABC Radio Sydney]], Larry Buttrose explained that "From the very first time I came in contact with the story, I knew it was a fantastic story,... It was a film crying to be made". Buttrose recorded hours of interviews with both Saroo and his adoptive mother and completed a 70,000-word manuscript in a hotel room in Kolkata to meet a tough three-month deadline set by the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoh |first1=Amanda |title=A Long Way Home: Ghostwriter Larry Buttrose on telling Saroo Brierley's story behind the film Lion |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-16/a-long-way-home-ghostwriter-larry-buttrose-on-story-behind-lion/8276278 |website=[[ABC Radio Sydney]]

==Reception==
Karina Wetherbee of ''[[Vail Daily]]'' stated "There is a real feeling of catharsis when reading Brierley's astounding narrative, in the classic sense of a happy ending, for the journey of the author as a boy — and then again as a young man — evokes the audacity of a fable, but it is set in the real world, a place where wonderment and miraculous occurrences can often seem wanting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wetherbee |first1=Karina |title=Book review: ‘A Long Way Home,’ by Saroo Brierley |url=https://www.vaildaily.com/entertainment/book-review-a-long-way-home-by-saroo-brierley/ |website=[[Vail Daily]] |accessdate=15 October 2018 |date=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dianne Dempsey of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' commented "Brierley writes in a straightforward manner without trying to do anything fancy except tell a remarkable story. As well as the tale of his quest, he provides an informative and fascinating insight into how Third World families live with, and somehow survive, their poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dempsey |first1=Dianne |title=A Long Way Home |url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/a-long-way-home-20130829-2ssgs.html |website=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=15 October 2018 |date=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor Dibbert of ''[[International Policy Digest]]'' added "It’s not hard to understand why this work has received such high praise. This is an honest story of pain, struggle, hope and love. He concludes the book on a reflective note... Brierley’s journey is inspirational and deeply moving; it’s another reminder of how potent passion and the human spirit actually are".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dibbert |first1=Taylor |title=Book Review: ‘A Long Way Home’27 Jun 2015  Taylor Dibbert  Book Review: ‘A Long Way Home’ |url=https://intpolicydigest.org/2015/06/27/book-review-a-long-way-home/ |website=[[International Policy Digest]] |accessdate=15 October 2018 |date=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
In 2016, the book was adapted into major international feature film ''[[Lion (2016 film)|Lion]]'', directed by [[Garth Davis]] and starring [[Dev Patel]], [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Rooney Mara]]. The film premiered at the [[2016 Toronto International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/entertainment/saroo-brierley-on-set-to-see-his-life-story-take-shape/story-fnj3tycr-1227202828052|title=Saroo Brierley on set to see his life story take shape|work=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]|date=31 January 2015|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/dev-patel-lion-trailer|title=Dev Patel’s Lion May Be the Inspirational Awards-Season Tale You’re Looking For|last=Busis|first=Hillary|access-date=28 June 2018|work=Vanity Fair|date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2016/tiff-2016-garth-davis-lion-with-dev-patel-is-an-emotional-journey/|title=TIFF 2016: Garth Davis' 'Lion' with Dev Patel is an Emotional Journey|access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://film.list.co.uk/article/84586-lion/|title=Lion|date=13 September 2016|access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-toronto-international-film-festival-live-updates-2016-htmlstory.html|title='Arrival,' 'La La Land,' 'Moonlight' and more: How the Toronto Film Festival movies will play with Oscar voters|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dev Patel]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].

'''''A Man with Dead Birds, and Other Figures, in a Stable''''' (c. 1655) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Pieter de Hooch]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the [[National Gallery, London]].

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1908, who wrote; "269. SOLDIER, A WOMAN WITH A CHILD, AND DEAD GAME IN A STABLE. In the left foreground a soldier, seen in profile to the right, is seated on the floor plucking a dead bird. In front of him to the right is a heap of dead birds, at which a dog is sniffing. In the middle, farther back, stands a young woman with a child at her breast. To her right the soldier's cloak hangs on a post, and behind her to the right another garment, seen in full light, is thrown over a wooden partition. Above the woman's head is a window, between two cross-beams. In the middle of the background a gentleman with long curls, a slouch hat, and a cloak, enters at the stable-door. Panel, 21 1/2 inches by 19 1/2 inches. Exhibited at Leyden, 1906, No. 21. In the collection of F. Fleischmann, London."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/550/mode/1up entry 269 for ''Soldier, A Woman with a Child, and Dead Game in a Stable''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the museum, X-ray photography shows that the dog and dead birds were painted over the figure of a wounded man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/pieter-de-hooch-a-man-with-dead-birds-and-other-figures-in-a-stable Pieter de Hooch - ''A Man with Dead Birds, and Other Figures, in a Stable''] on museum website&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Modern analysis of the provenance and paint analysis leads to the conclusion that the 19th-century painter [[Ignatius Van Regemorter]] (1795–1873) was probably the one who did the overpainting, at some time after he or his father purchased it in 1825. The painting was later sold in 1900 for 85 guineas as a work by [[Jan Baptist Weenix]] and was donated to the museum in 1929. It was described in later catalogues as "a collaborative work by Weenix and de Hooch", but there has never been any evidence the two painters worked together.

==Wounded man painting==
Various provenance records mention a wounded man by De Hooch which were previously thought to pertain to another painting by De Hooch, but could also be this painting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4320">'''Aesthetic distance''' refers to the gap between a viewer's conscious reality and the fictional reality presented in a work of art.  When a reader becomes fully engrossed in the illusory narrative world of a book, the author has achieved a close aesthetic distance.  If the author then jars the reader from the reality of the story, essentially reminding the reader they are reading a book, the author is said to have "violated the aesthetic distance." &lt;ref&gt;[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/lit_term.html Literary terms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aesthetic+distance Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept originates from [[Immanuel_Kant|Immanuel Kant's]] [[Critique of Judgement]], where he establishes the notion of ''disinterested delight'' which does not depend on the subject's having a desire for the object itself, he writes, "delight in beautiful art does not, in the pure judgement of taste, involve an immediate interest. [...] it is not the object that is of immediate interest, but rather the inherent character of the beauty qualifying it for such a partnership-a character, therefore, that belongs to the very essence of beauty."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1790). 'Critique of Pure Judgement.' trans. Meredith, James Creed. Blacksburg: Virginia Tech. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term aesthetic distance itself derives from an article by Edward Bullough published in 1912. In that article, he begins with the image of a passenger on a ship observing fog at sea. If the passenger thinks of the fog in terms of danger to the ship, the experience is not aesthetic, but to regard the beautiful scene in detached wonder is to take legitimate aesthetic attitude. One must feel, but not too much. Bullough writes, "Distance … is obtained by separating the object and its appeal from one's own self, by putting it out of gear with practical needs and ends. Thereby the 'contemplation' of the object becomes alone possible."&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, Edward (1912/1989). '"Psychical Distance" as a Factor in Art and as an Aesthetic Principle.' Dickie, G., Sclafani, R., Roblin, R. ''Aesthetics: A Critical Anthology.'' 2nd ed. New York: St. Martin's. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors of film, fiction, drama, and poetry evoke different levels of aesthetic distance.  For instance, [[William Faulkner]] tends to invoke a close aesthetic distance by using [[first-person narrative]] and [[Stream_of_consciousness_(narrative_mode)|stream of consciousness]], while [[Ernest Hemingway]] tends to invoke a greater aesthetic distance from the reader through use of [[Narrative_mode#Third-person_view|third person narrative]].

==Violating the aesthetic distance==

Anything that pulls a viewer out of the reality of a work of fiction is said to be a violation of aesthetic distance.  An easy example in theater or film is "breaking the fourth wall," when characters suspend the progress of the story to speak directly to the audience.  When the aesthetic distance is deliberately violated in theater, it is known as the [[distancing effect]], or ''Verfremdungseffekt'', a concept coined by playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]].

Many examples of violating the aesthetic distance may also be found in [[meta-fiction]].  [[William Goldman]], in ''[[The Princess Bride]]'', repeatedly interrupts his own fairy tale to speak directly to the reader. In the musical, ''[[Stop the World I Want to Get Off]]'', the [[protagonist]], ''Littlechap'', periodically stops the progress of the play to address the audience directly.

In film, the aesthetic distance is often violated unintentionally.  Examples might include a director's cameo, poor special effects, or perhaps blatant [[product placement]] - any can be enough to pull a viewer out of the reality of the film.  [[David Mamet]] in ''[[On Directing Film]]'' asserts that any direct depiction of graphic sex or violence in film is an inherent violation of aesthetic distance, as audience members will instinctively make judgments as to whether or not what they just saw was real, and thus be pulled out of the story-telling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5831">[[File:Alfeñiques or sugar fugures.jpg|250px|thumb|Assortment of alfeñiques for ''[[Día de Muertos]].]]

An '''alfeñique''' is a [[confection]] molded from sugar paste. The design and construction of these figures can vary from region to region. Today, alfeñique figures, especially [[calavera]]s (known in the US as Sugar Skulls), are widely created in [[Mexico]] for the [[Day of the Dead]] celebrations in November.

==History==
[[File:Borregos de dulce..JPG|thumb|Alfeñiques at the ''[[Alfeñique fair|Feria del Alfeñique]]'' in [[Toluca]].]]
Alfeñique are folk art objects made from a sugar paste, originating in Italy where figurines were made from sugar for religious decorations. They became popular in Spain, wherefrom they were eventually brought to Mexico with Catholicism, where they became a part of Day of the Dead celebrations, starting around the 17th or 18th century.&lt;ref name="cite2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.celebrate-day-of-the-dead.com/mexican-sugar-skull.html |title=Mexican Sugar Skull |publisher=Thaneeya LLC |year=2010–2011 |accessdate=March 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfeñique, whose name is from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] was used to replace the Aztec tradition of making figurines of [[amaranth]] for altars.  The Spanish [[conquistador]]s brought sugar cane, which became the main ingredient in the making of these figurines which continues to this day.&lt;ref name="pomar"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[María Teresa Pomar]] |year=2004 |title=Alfeñique  |location= México |language=Spanish |publisher=CONACULTA |isbn=970-35-0578-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the colonial period, figures of sheep made with this were popular.&lt;ref name="gmasters"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Cándida |editor1-last= Fernández de Calderón |title= Great Masters of Mexican Folk Art: From the collection of Fomento Cultural Banamex  |edition=2 |year=2003 |publisher= Fomento Cultural Banamex, A.C.   |location=Mexico City |isbn=968 5234 09 4  |page=503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the main production center for alfenique figures are [[Toluca]], [[San Miguel de Allende]] and [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]]. Today, the paste is used to form hundreds of types of shapes which include rabbits, lions, ducks, doves, cows, bulls, donkeys, pigs, frogs, horses, deer, angels, skulls and coffins.&lt;ref name="gmasters"/&gt;  The art form has taken on more elaborate sculptures that involve more sophisticated and modern techniques that there are now encyclopedic volumes on how to create them for all different occasions, apart from Day of the Dead celebrations.&lt;ref name="mcgraw"&gt;{{cite book |year=2004 |title=Arte Mexicano del Azúcar: Enciclopedia Ilustrado  |location= Ciudad de México |publisher=McGraw Hill |language=Spanish |editor1-first=Marithé  |editor1-last=de Alvarado |isbn=970-10-3596-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are regional fairs and events that celebrate this art form, including [[Alfeñique fair|ones in Toluca, Mexico State]]  and in Leon, Guanajuato.&lt;ref name="cite5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leonguanajuato.com/galerias/alfenique.php |title=Feria Artesanal del Alfeñique, Mexico |publisher=Government of [[León, Guanajuato]] |accessdate=March 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303160813/http://leonguanajuato.com/galerias/alfenique.php |archive-date=2009-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cite6"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/d9cff78f9e4c88e6e0efd703f4ea180e |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419011526/http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/d9cff78f9e4c88e6e0efd703f4ea180e |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 19, 2013 |title=Detallan actividades de la Feria del Alfeñique de Toluca |publisher=Milenio |location=Mexico City |date=September 28, 2010 |accessdate=March 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
[[File:Calaveritas de dulce.jpg|thumb|Small alfeñique skulls]]
The paste is prepared by mixing powdered sugar with chautle, a vegetable adhesive and lemon. Egg whites are beaten separately then folded into the sugar. Vegetable dyes are added for color. The unworked portion is covered with a damp cloth to keep it from hardening. Molds are prepared by carefully cleaning them, then dusting them with flour so the sugar mixture does not stick. The sugar paste is flattened into thin circles which are pressed into the molds, then left to dry for 24 hours&lt;ref name="gmasters"/&gt;

The two halves of the figure are then taken from the molds and joined together with more sugar paste, slightly thinned with water. This is left to dry again before decoration. Decorative elements can include cotton balls, sequins, sugar paste which is shaped and attached, plastic jewels and many other items&lt;ref name="gmasters"/&gt;

==Variations==
The different regions make their alfeñique figures according to local traditions and ingredients.  Many families have been involved in making figurines for generations and some use molds that go back just as far. Apart from their popularity during Day of the Dead celebrations, many families display the objects, particularly the skulls, in their homes.&lt;ref name="pomar"/&gt; In [[Oaxaca]], they commonly take the shape of skulls, crowns, crucifixes, the dead and are made from crystallized sugar with honey in the center. In the [[State of Mexico]], the most common objects are coffins, hearses, deer, sheep, angels, fruit, and skulls made of white sugar paste.&lt;ref name="pomar"/&gt; In [[Puebla]], the most common objects are skulls and coffins and the main ingredients include almonds, peanuts and pumpkin seeds mixed with sugar and egg, in the style of an almond paste.&lt;ref name="peques"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.peques.com.mx/el_alfenique.htm |title=El alfeñique|publisher=CAD SA de CV |year=2010–2011 |accessdate=March 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Federation of Arts''' ('''AFA''') is a [[Not for profit|nonprofit]] organization that creates art exhibitions for presentation in museums around the world, publishes exhibition catalogues, and develops education programs. The organization’s founding in 1909 was endorsed by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and spearheaded by Secretary of State [[Elihu Root]] and eminent art patrons and artists of the day. The AFA’s mission is to enrich the public’s experience and understanding of the [[visual arts]], and this is accomplished through its exhibitions, catalogues, and public programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Federation of Arts Website|url=http://www.afaweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the AFA has organized or circulated approximately 3,000 exhibitions that have been viewed by more than 10 million people in museums in every state, as well as in [[Canada]], [[Latin America]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]].

==History==

===Early history and publications===

The AFA was founded on May 12, 1909.

At a meeting on May 11, 1909, convened by the [[National Academy of Art’s]]&lt;ref name="EduRpt1909"&gt;{{citation | title = Report Of The Commissioner Of Education For The Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1909 | publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] | year = 1910 | location = [[Washington, D. C.]] | page = 54 | oclc = 297319047 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TRspAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage}}, {{ASIN|B000KXOEA4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Board of Regents—among whom were President [[William Howard Taft]], former president Theodore Roosevelt, [[Cecilia Beaux]], [[Robert Woods Bliss]], [[William Merritt Chase]], Robert W. de Forest, [[Homer Saint-Gaudens]], [[Charles L. Hutchinson]], [[Archer M. Huntington]], Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], Leila Mechlin, [[Andrew W. Mellon]], [[J. Pierpont Morgan]], [[Francis D. Millet]], Secretary of State [[Elihu Root]], and [[Henry Walters]], among others— Elihu Root called for the formation of an agency that would send “exhibitions of original works of art on tour to the hinterlands of the United States.” With the unanimous endorsement of Root’s motion by representatives from more than eighty American art institutions—among them, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], and the [[American Academy in Rome]]—the AFA was founded on May 12, 1909. The organization’s founders further agreed to hold annual meetings and devote themselves to promoting the visual arts as a vital component of the nation’s cultural life.&lt;ref name="U.S. Bureau of Education Report"&gt;{{cite journal|last=The United States Bureau of Education|title=American Federation of Arts|journal=Reports of the Department of the Interior|year=1909|volume=1|issue=5748|pages=54–56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRspAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage#v=snippet&amp;q=%22american%20federation%20of%20arts%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 January 2012|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutchinson, who at the time was the President of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], was elected the organization's first president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Millet |first=Frank D., Secretary |title= Proceedings of the Convention at which the American Federation of Arts was Formed - Held at Washington D.C. May 11th, 12th and 13th, 1909 |date=1909 |publisher= Press of Byron S. Adams |location= Washington, D.C. |isbn=|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Root proposed the creation of the AFA in 1909, the nation’s artistic wealth was largely concentrated in eastern cities and inaccessible to most citizens. The AFA and its traveling exhibitions were envisioned as a means of “bringing the museum to the people.” During its inaugural year, the AFA organized three traveling exhibitions, the first of which was ''Thirty-Eight Paintings by Prominent American Artists'', and launched ''Art and Progress'' magazine (later renamed ''Magazine of Art''), an innovative vehicle for art scholarship that continued to be published until 1953. The AFA also published the first edition of ''[[Who's Who in American Art]]'' (1935), as well as the ''[[American Art Annual]]'' (later known as the ''[[American Art Directory]]''). While it no longer publishes these directories and journals, the AFA retains a commitment to publishing new art historical research through the catalogues it produces in conjunction with its exhibitions.

===Lobbying efforts===

In 1910, the AFA promoted the creation of a [[National Commission of Fine Arts]], which was subsequently established by an act of congress to advise the government on matters of art and design as they pertain to the nation’s capital. In 1913, the AFA launched a successful lobbying effort to remove tariffs on art entering the United States and a 1916 session with the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] to protest prohibitively high interstate taxes on traveling art. In 1920, the AFA was instrumental in organizing a lobbying campaign for the “development of a national gallery of art on a basis worthy of our great nation,” a goal eventually realized with the founding of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in 1941. Other government-tied AFA initiatives include arranging the first American representation in the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1924 and thereafter until the 1970s.

===Public programs===

The AFA’s history includes a series of programs designed to facilitate greater access and appreciation of the visual arts, among them, the first nationally broadcast radio programs about art (1930s–1940s); the Picture of the Month Program (1954), offering original paintings at low rental fees to small art and educational organizations; the Museum Donor Program (1960s), distributing allowances to regional museums to purchase contemporary American art; ''The Art of Seeing'' (1965), a landmark series of educational films on visual perception; ''The Curriculum in Visual Education'' (1966), a collection of films and instructional materials designed to heighten the aesthetic awareness of children; the Rent-an-Artist Program (renamed the Visitor Artist Program) (1970s), placing artists in residency at museums around the country; ''A History of the American Avant-Garde Cinema'' (1976), the first curatorially selected international traveling film program; and ART ACCESS I and II (1989–98), a fee-subsidy program sponsored by the Lila Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund making AFA exhibitions of American art more affordable for museums.

In 1909, the AFA created the Package Library, which offered newspaper and magazine clippings on a variety of art subjects for loan to AFA members. Although intended primarily for use in communities with limited library facilities, the files were often in demand by members in larger cities as well. By 1942, the library included more than 1,000 envelopes covering topics from contemporary American painting to industrial art.

In 1934, in collaboration with the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]] and with support from the [[Carnegie Corporation]], the AFA launched the first nationally broadcast radio series on art, "Art in America 1600–1865," with [[René d'Harnoncourt]] as program director. The first subject was “America After the Civil War: [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] and [[Winslow Homer]]—Expatriate and Stay-at-Home.” Discontinued during [[World War II]], the radio program was reestablished in the 1940s with the title “Living Art.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Museum of Modern Art Press Release|url=http://www.moma.org/docs/press_archives/191/releases/MOMA_1934-35_0006.pdf?2010|accessdate=13 January 2012|newspaper=Museum of Modern Art Archive|date=September 23, 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the AFA inaugurated the [http://www.thedirectorsforum.org Directors Forum], a two-and-a-half-day annual conference for museum directors that featured panel discussions with some of the most distinguished professionals in the art world. Beginning in 2005, the Directors Forum is now an annual program of the independent [[Art Museum Partnership]]. Building upon the success of that program, the AFA began, in 2001, a similar conference for art museum curators. The Curators Forum later evolved into the independent [[Association of Art Museum Curators]] in 2001. In 2003, the AFA instituted ArtTalks, a lecture series featuring prominent artists and other influential figures of the art world, among them, artists [[Janine Antoni]], [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]], [[John Currin]], [[Shirin Neshat]], and [[Do-Ho Suh]]; ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic [[Roberta Smith]]; ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' writer [[Adam Gopnik]]; and [[Sotheby's]] Worldwide Head of Contemporary Art Tobias Meyer.

Most recently, the AFA launched ArtViews, a series of panel discussions that address critical issues in the museum field. Its first edition held in 2011 was titled "Shifting Challenges in the Protection of Archaeological Heritage" and was organized in conjunction with the [[New York University Institute of Fine Arts|Institute of Fine Arts]]  and the [https://www.aamd.org/ Association of Art Museum Directors]. More recent subjects have included: "Art Museum Funding at the Crossroads" (2012), "Art Museum Blockbusters: Myths, Facts, and their Future (2013), "Digital Space/Physical Space, Mapping the 21st Century Museum" (2015), "The Future of Art Museum Leadership" (2016), and "Museums Now: Relevance and Representation" (2017).

===Film and video===

Through the development of touring film and video exhibitions, publications, and an eventual collection of 139 documentaries on the arts and avant-garde films and videos, the AFA developed a groundbreaking film and video program that focused on the work of independent contemporary media artists in this country and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Museum of Modern Art Acquires Collection|url=http://www.moma.org/docs/press_archives/7248/releases/MOMA_1994_0034_24.pdf?2010|accessdate=13 January 2012|newspaper=The Museum of Modern Art Archive|date=April 20, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released beginning in 1949, the organization’s publications on the subject include the pamphlet ''Guide to Films on Art'' (1949); ''Films on Art'' (1952), a comprehensive guide that listed and reviewed more than 450 films on art subjects; ''New American Filmmakers'' (1971), a catalogue of independent films produced in cooperation with the [[Whitney Museum]]; ''A History of the American Avant-Garde Cinema'' (1976);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Constance Penley and Janet Bergstrom (for the ''Camera Obscura'' collective"|title=The Avant-Garde: Histories and Theories|journal=Screen|date=Autumn 1978|volume=19|issue=3|pages=113–128|url=http://screen.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/3/113.extract|accessdate=13 January 2012|doi=10.1093/screen/19.3.113}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Films on Art: A Source Book''  (1977),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canadian Centre for Films on Art, American Federation of Arts|title=Films on art: a source book|year=1977|publisher=Watson-Guptill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8230-1780-5|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/films-on-art-a-source-book/oclc/3202840}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second edition of the 1952 volume ''Films on Art''; and ''Before Hollywood: Turn-of-the-Century Film from American Archives'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birchard|first=Robert S.|title="Before Hollywood": A Review|journal=Film History|year=1987|volume=1|issue=4|pages=393–397|jstor=3814990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, the AFA co-sponsored the first art film festival in the U.S.—''Films on Art Festival'', in Woodstock, New York, with the Woodstock Artists Association, the [[College Art Association]], [[Hunter College]], and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AFA Finding Aid|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/american-federation-arts-records-5411/more|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, the AFA established ''Circulating Films on Art'', thus becoming the first organization of its kind to circulate such films for rent. In 1971, the AFA began circulating 200 films from the Whitney’s New American Filmmakers series, expanding the collaboration in 1979 with the circulation of films from the [[Whitney Biennial]] and again in 1983 with the addition of video to the Biennial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James, Ed.|first=David E.|title=To Free the Cinema: Jonas Mekas &amp; the New York Underground|year=1992|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-07894-7|pages=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nLnY2vXKxAkC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=Whitney%E2%80%99s+New+American+Filmmakers+series+american+federation+of+arts#v=onepage&amp;q=Whitney%E2%80%99s%20New%20American%20Filmmakers%20series%20american%20federation%20of%20arts&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the AFA organized the first curatorially selected international traveling film exhibition, ''A History of the American Avant-Garde Cinema''. In addition to its traveling video selections from the Whitney, in 1983, the AFA began organizing independent traveling video exhibitions, the first of which included ''American Documentary Video: Subject to Change'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sterritt|first=David|title=Learning to Love Those ... uh, Documentaries|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1989/0322/ldoc.html|accessdate=13 January 2012|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=March 22, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New Video: Japan''; and ''Revisiting Romance: New Feminist Video''.

In 1993, the AFA transferred its collection of prize-winning American and European films and videotapes to the [[Museum of Modern Art]]’s Circulating Film and Video program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Museum of Modern Art Acquires Collection of Film and Videos on the Arts from American Federation of Arts|url=https://www.moma.org/docs/press_archives/7248/releases/MOMA_1994_0034_24.pdf?|accessdate=13 January 2012|newspaper=Museum of Modern Art Archive|date=April 20, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1996, upon the dissolution of its Media Arts Department, transferred its inventory of film and video exhibitions to the Film and Video Department of the Museum of Modern Art.

===Offices and mergers===

After initial meetings in [[Francis Davis Millet|Francis Millet]]’s studio in Washington, D.C., in 1909 the AFA moved its headquarters into the [[Octagon Building (Washington, D.C.)|Octagon Building]] at 1741 New York Avenue, N.W., renting space from the [[American Institute of Architects]]. The [[National League of Handicraft Societies]] merged with the AFA in 1912, and constituent societies were made AFA members. In 1913, the AFA opened its first New York office in the [[Fine Arts Building (New York)|Fine Arts Building]] at 215 West 57th Street. The office later moved to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and then to 40 East 49th Street. Beginning in 1952, the AFA relocated its headquarters, moving from Washington, D.C. to New York, renting offices at 1083 Fifth Avenue. In 1987, the AFA’s merger with the [[Art Museum Association of America]] (AMAA) brought together the two oldest nonprofit art museum organizations in America, creating a larger national organization that could offer a comprehensive set of services without duplication. Retaining the name American Federation of Arts, the new organization maintained offices in both New York and San Francisco, and former AMAA Director [[Myrna Smoot]] became director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGill|first=Douglas C.|title=Merger of Two Groups Serving Art Museums|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/28/arts/merger-of-two-groups-serving-art-museums.html|accessdate=13 January 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 28, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The San Francisco office was dedicated to the AFA’s Museum Services Department. Also based in the West Coast was the AFA’s administration of the [[Getty Center|Getty]]’s Museum Management Institution (MMI), a training program for museum directors held at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]. Now known as the [[Getty Leadership Institute at Claremont Graduate University|Getty Leadership Institute]], it is a program of the Getty Trust and operates out of [[Claremont Graduate University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Getty Leadership Institute|url=http://www.cgu.edu/pages/7227.asp|work=About GLI at CGU|publisher=The Getty Leadership Institute and CGU|accessdate=13 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113091238/http://www.cgu.edu/pages/7227.asp|archive-date=2012-01-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the AFA closed its West Coast office and moved the Museum Services Department to its New York headquarters. In 2007, the AFA sold its townhouse at 41 East 65th Street and moved to its current location at 305 East 47th Street.

==Exhibitions==

AFA exhibitions encompass a wide range of mediums, artists, historical periods, and cultural traditions—from Roman portraiture and Native American artifacts to American impressionism and contemporary art and sculpture. The AFA also collaborates with distinguished institutions around the world to tour important aspects of their collections. To further engage and inform museum visitors and art enthusiasts, the AFA produces innovative educational components and richly illustrated catalogues introducing original scholarship.

The '''''American Symphony''''' is a [[symphony]] for [[orchestra]] by the American composer [[Adam Schoenberg]].  The work was commissioned by the [[Kansas City Symphony]] and was completed in early 2011.  It was first performed by the Kansas City Symphony under the direction of [[Michael Stern (conductor)|Michael Stern]] at the [[Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts]] in [[Kansas City]] on March 4, 2011.

==Composition==

===Background===
Schoenberg was inspired to write the ''American Symphony'' by the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. Presidential election]], about which he wrote, "...both parties asked the people to embrace change and make a difference. I was both excited and honored about ushering in this new era in our nation's history, and for the first time, I truly understood what it meant to be American."  The composer cited [[Aaron Copland]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Copland)|Symphony No. 3]], which Schoenberg described as "the quintessential American symphony," as a musical influence on the work.  He wrote, "Quite serendipitously, I heard Copland's 3rd three nights after President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] was elected and, seeing that our country and world had needs similar to those of Copland's time, I was inspired to make a difference. I set out to write a modern American symphony that paid homage to our past and looked forward to a brighter future."

Despite this, Shoenberg described the ''American Symphony'' as "not a patriotic work," adding, "the symphony reflects a respect and responsibility for the great potential of our nation and a hunger to affect positive change. It is about our collective ability to restore hope within ourselves and our neighbors, both here and around the world."&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;[[Adam Schoenberg|Schoenberg, Adam]] (2011). [http://adamschoenberg.com/works/american-symphony-2011/ Program Notes: ''American Symphony'']. Retrieved August 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
The symphony has a duration of approximately 24 minutes and is cast in five [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
#Fanfare
#White on Blue
#Rondo
#Prayer
#Stars, Stripes, and Celebration

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a large orchestra consisting of three [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (third doubling [[piccolo]]), three [[oboe]]s (third doubling [[cor anglais]]), three [[clarinet]]s (third doubling [[bass clarinet]]), three [[bassoon]]s (third doubling [[contrabassoon]]), four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[Pedal harp|harp]], [[piano]] (doubling [[celesta]]), [[timpani]], four percussionists, and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewing the world premiere, the music critic Timothy McDonald of ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' highly praised the symphony, writing, "Schoenberg demonstrated a distinctive and exciting compositional voice. His ''American Symphony'' is bold and brilliant, and deserves to be a staple among orchestras in the U.S. and abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McDonald |first=Timothy |title=Review: Kansas City Symphony with guest pianist Jonathan Biss |work=[[The Kansas City Star]] |date=March 5, 2011 |url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/article297955/Review--Kansas-City-Symphony-with-guest-pianist-Jonathan-Biss.html |accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paul Horsley of Kansas City-based journal ''The Independent'' called it an "agreeable new piece" and wrote, "If the finale felt prolix in proportion to the overall length of the symphony, the piece revealed the soul of a strong musician with a natural sense of melody, a playful knack for rhythm and a serious approach to orchestration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Horsley |first=Paul |title=Kansas City Symphony Presents Premiere of Appealing New Work |work=The Independent |date=March 5, 2011 |url=http://www.kcindependent.com/a-night-at-the-symphony/ |accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing a later performance of the piece with the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Symphony, George Day of ''[[The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier]]'' observed, "Its five movements are mostly brisk, sometimes noisy, but always engaging. The music speaks of the variety, vitality and optimism of the American spirit. Not exactly a patriotic work, it nevertheless conveys a respect, even a reverence, for the past and future of America."  He added, "Schoenberg clearly knows how to orchestrate, and I am sure we have not heard the last of him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Day |first=George |title=Review: Contemporary Music Focus of Skillfully Performed WCFSymphony's Sounds American Festival Conclusion |work=[[The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier]] |date=October 15, 2014 |url=http://wcfcourier.com/lifestyles/review-contemporary-music-focus-of-skillfully-performced-wcfsymphony-s-sounds/article_1d611696-906c-583e-8ea1-954c111bba12.html |accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
A recording of the ''American Symphony'' featuring the Kansas City Symphony under the direction of Michael Stern was released through Reference Recordings on January 20, 2017.  The album also includes performances of Schoenberg's ''[[Finding Rothko]]'' (2006) and ''[[Picture Studies]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Neas |first=Patrick |title=Kansas City Symphony prepares to record Adam Schoenberg's work |work=The Kansas City Star |date=June 7, 2014 |url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/classical-music-dance/article487471/Kansas-City-Symphony-prepares-to-record-Adam-Schoenberg%E2%80%99s-work.html |accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Neas |first=Patrick |title=Four new classical CDs, including one by KC Symphony, worth a listen |work=The Kansas City Star |date=July 1, 2017 |url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/classical-music-dance/article158725814.html |accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Castillo |first=Patrick |title=Rothko and Americana Inspire Orchestral Works of Adam Schoenberg |publisher=[[WQXR-FM]] |date=February 27, 2017 |url=http://www.wqxr.org/story/rothko-and-americana-inspire-orchestral-works-adam-schoenberg/ |accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andries van Eertvelt'''&lt;ref&gt;Name variations: Andries van Aertvelt, Andries van Artevelde, Andries van Artevelt, Andries van Artvelt, Andries van Ertvelt, Andries van Eetvelt, Naentjen, Eetvelt, Naentkens den schilder. [[Pierre-Jean Mariette]] notes in his ''Abecedario'' the variations 'Alfelt' and [[André Félibien]] spells his name as 'Ert-veest'. Van Eertvelt signed all notarial documents as 'Andries van Artvelt' and monogrammed his work with 'AVA'. His family name is undoubtedly derived from the village called '[[Ertvelde]]' which is now part of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] municipality of [[Evergem]].&lt;/ref&gt; (1590 – 1652), was a [[Flemish]] [[painter]], draughtsman and engraver who was one of the first Flemish artists to specialize in [[marine art]]. Several of his pupils also became prominent marine artists.&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/artists/25622 Andries van Eertvelt] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Andries van Eertvelt was born in Antwerp and baptized in the [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Antwerp cathedral]] on 25 March 1590. There is no record of the masters with whom he trained. He was registered as a master in the Antwerp [[Guild of St. Luke]] in 1609. He married Catherine de Vlieger on 28 November 1615 in the [[St. Andrew's Church, Antwerp|St. Andrew's Church]]. The couple had two children. His wife died in 1626 or 1627.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

After the death of his wife he travelled together with one of his pupils, [[Matthieu van Plattenberg]], to Italy.&lt;ref name=storm&gt;[http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/12288.html Matthieu van Plattenberg, A Dutch Ship Running onto a Rocky Coast] at the [[National Maritime Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Van Eertvelt is documented in [[Genoa]] from 1628–1630, where he lived with his compatriot [[Cornelis de Wael]], who also practiced marine art, in particular the depiction of sea battles. Cornelis de Wael was a long-term resident of Genoa and arranged work for van Eervelt during his stay there.
[[File:Eertvelt Storm at sea.jpg|thumb|left|285px|''Storm at sea'', before 1630]]

In 1630 van Eertvelt returned to Antwerp. In the early 1630s he had a relationship with Susanna April, with whom he had two illegitimate daughters, Susanna and Annemarie (born in 1630 and 1632). On 3 October 1633 he married Elisabeth Boots in the [[St. James' Church, Antwerp|St. James Church]] in Antwerp. Their son Jan Baptist was baptized in the same church on 11 February 1634.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

Van Eertvelt had a very successful career as a marine artists and some of his works were exported to markets in Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt; He also had an eager clientele in the [[Dutch Republic]].&lt;ref name=rmg&gt;[http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/12237.html Andreas van Eertvelt, "Embarkation of Spanish Troops"] at the [[National Maritime Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was remembered as a "son of the seas" by the Flemish 17th century biographer [[Cornelis de Bie]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3pFbAAAAQAAJ Cornelis de Bie, ''Het gulden cabinet vande edel vry schilder const''], Jan Meyssens, Antwerp, 1661, p.105, online facsimile version on [[Google books]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony van Dyck]] painted his portrait and an engraving freely cut after this portrait by [[Schelte a Bolswert]] was included in van Dyck’s "Iconography" (Icones Principum Virorum), a collection of portraits of leading personalities of van Dyck’s time.&lt;ref name=ox&gt;L. J. Wassink. "Eertvelt, Andries van." Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 3 Dec. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1426533&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=van+eertvelt&amp;page=1 Andreas van Ertvelt, in "Icones Principum Virorum"], at the [[British Museum]] website&lt;/ref&gt;  Van Eertvelt also appears to have engaged in diplomatic activity. He took some letters relating to a possible peace treaty between Spain and the Dutch Republic from [[Balthazar Gerbier]], an Anglo-Dutch diplomat residing in Antwerp, to [[Constantijn Huygens]], the secretary to the [[Prince of Orange]], in the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Marika Keblusek, Badeloch Vera Noldus. ''Double Agents: Cultural and Political Brokerage in Early Modern Europe'', BRILL, 10 May 2011, p. 156-157&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the teacher of [[Gaspar van Eyck]], [[Matthieu van Plattenberg]] and possibly [[Hendrik van Minderhout]].&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;  He was possibly also the teacher of the leading Flemish marine painter [[Bonaventura Peeters (I)]] and of [[Sebastian Castro (painter)|Sebastian Castro]].&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt;

==Work==
[[File:Andries van Eertvelt - Two Ships at Anchor - WGA7476.jpg|thumb|290px|''Two Ships at Anchor'', after 1640]]

Van Eertvelt is regarded as the first Flemish marine painter. His marine paintings covered the whole range of battle scenes, storms, views of ships in rivers and harbours, night scenes etc. His favourite themes were Dutch ships at sea and views of ships in southern, often imaginary harbours.

Whereas there may have been an influence of Dutch marine painter [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom]], some regard the impact on his style of the work of the 16th century Flemish painter [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] as more significant.&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt;  It is assumed that van Eertvelt spent some time in the Dutch Republic in the early 1600s although there is no record of this other than his paintings of Dutch ships and ports. He may have resided in Haarlem, but there is no proof for the widespread suggestion that he studied under Vroom. He may very well have familiarized himself with Vroom’s style in Antwerp where paintings of Vroom as well as copies and imitations after them were readily available in the art market. Van Eertvelt is known to have made copies of Vroom’s work but was able to develop his own style.&lt;ref name=bril&gt;Margarita Russell, ''Visions of the Sea: Hendrick C. Vroom and the Origins of Dutch Marine Painting'', Brill Archive, 1983, p. 181-185&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Andries van Eertvelt - Embarkation of Spanish Troops (1630s).jpg|thumb|290px|left|''Embarkation of Spanish Troops'']]
In his early paintings, van Eertvelt adopted a bright, mannerist style and his palette was characterized by greenish-black and brown tones. He often relied on white to make the rigging of the ships stand out against the dark sea.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt;  This style is visible in ''[[:Image:The Return to Amsterdam of the Second Expedition to the East Indies on 19 July 1599, by Andries van Eertvelt.jpg|The Return to Amsterdam of the Second Expedition to the East Indies on 19 July 1599]]'' dated in the 1610s.

Later he changed to a softer and more subtle palette in particular after his return from Italy. He then favoured views of southern harbours, with calm seas painted in soft tones.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt;  This mature style is visible in the ''Two Ships at Anchor'' in the [[Hermitage Museum]].

Van Eertvelt collaborated occasionally with other Antwerp painters. It is currently believed that the seascape in van Dyck's ''[[:Image:A. van Dyck Portrait of Nicolaes van der Borght 1625-1635.jpg|Portrait of Nicolaes van der Borght, Merchant in Antwerp]]'' is by van Eertvelt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/5803 Portrait of Nicolaes van der Borght, Merchant in Antwerp] at the Netherlands Institute for Art History&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Eertvelt was also active as an engraver. The current whereabouts of an etching by his hand, depicting the frozen river Scheldt in 1621 and another of the fort 'Vlaams Hoofd' in Antwerp mentioned in reports are not known.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

During the rest of the year, there are related projects such as promoting local designers, holding a branding competition for the Serbian Center for the Promotion of Science, and participating in the Partners of the Human Cities/ Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belgradedesignweek.com/projects/|title=Projects|date=14 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humancities.eu/story/belgrade-design-week-welcomes-the-city-of-kragujevac-to-the-human-cities-family/|title=Belgrade Design Week welcomes the City of Kragujevac to the Human Cities/ family!|website=humancities.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="belgradedesignweek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belgradedesignweek.com/interview-with-jovan-jelovac-narativ/|title=INTERVIEW WITH JOVAN JELOVAC – NARATIV|date=1 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also spearheaded the Belgrade 2020 project, promoting the city as a candidate for the [[European Capital of Culture]].&lt;ref name="belgradedesignweek.com"/&gt;

== History ==
First held in 2005, Belgrade Design Week festival was founded by brand consultant [[Jovan Jelovac]], a formally trained architect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.disegnodaily.com/article/belgrade-design-week|title=Belgrade Design Week|website=DisegnoDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The conference costs about half a million euros to produce and is supported mostly through commercial and media sponsorships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For Jelovac, education was the primary reason for launching the summit, as well as inspiring the country's citizens through design. In 2014, the president of Serbia, [[Tomislav Nikolić]], presided over the event, mentioning how design can contribute to the country's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belgradedesignweek.com/the-ninth-belgrade-design-week-launched/|title=THE NINTH BELGRADE DESIGN WEEK LAUNCHED-DIZAJN PARK MAGAZINE|date=29 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, designer [[Karim Rashid]] was the ambassador for the second Belgrade Design Week and spoke at the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-king-of-kool-is-so-over-new-york/article667234/|title=The King of Kool is so over New York|last=|first=|date=2008-02-02|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-04-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he later headed several design projects in Serbia's capital city.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/on-the-verge-belgrade-europes-latest-urban-success-story/|title=On the Verge {{!}} Belgrade, Europe's Latest Urban Success Story|last=Beaumanis|first=Viia|date=2013-10-11|website=T Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashid stated that he is fascinated by Belgrade and Eastern Europe in general, seeing it "as the next upcoming place - everyone is psyched and enthusiastic about the rebuilding of these poetic, romantic, artistic and very intellectual places."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sajkaca.blogspot.ca/2008/05/karim-rashid-goes-belgrade_18.html|title=Karim Rashid goes Belgrade|website=sajkaca.blogspot.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/five-emerging-fashion-capitals-worth-knowing.html|title=Five Emerging Fashion Capitals Worth Knowing|work=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/design/moma-yugoslavia-new-exhibition-architecture-concrete-brutalism-celebrate-new-york-photography-a8178471.html|title=New MoMA exhibition celebrates the concrete world of Yugoslavia|date=2018-01-25|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After attending the design festival in 2008, architect [[Daniel Libeskind]] left with a billion dollar, albeit controversial, commission to redevelop the Belgrade waterfront.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/dec/10/belgrade-waterfront-gulf-petrodollars-exclusive-waterside-development|title=Belgrade Waterfront: an unlikely place for Gulf petrodollars to settle|first=Herbert|last=Wright|date=10 December 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lukabeograd.com/en/city-on-wather/master-plan/strategy.html|title=Luka Beograd :: Strategy|website=www.lukabeograd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major projects like this one are contributing to the renewal of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viaggi.corriere.it/viaggi/weekend/belgrado-hotel-ristoranti/?refresh_ce-cp|title=La nuova Belgrado: cosa vedere, gli hotel e i ristoranti|date=14 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other skyscrapers and shopping malls are in the planning stages, and architectural masterpieces, like the Art Nouveau "Geozavod" building, are being restored.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Belgrade is being compared to 1990's Berlin, seen as a decaying but alive metropolis: "Recently, the gritty city has emerged as an outpost of creative activity and urban cool on the cheap, against the lingering backdrop of socialism."

== About ==
The principal site of the festival changes annually with various run-down or abandoned buildings being renovated for the event. Past locations have included a palace, the bombed out hotel Jugoslavija, an abandoned department store,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/design/belgrade-design-week-09-the-location/|title=belgrade design week 09  the location|date=31 May 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the closed contemporary art museum, and an old factory.&lt;ref name="designboom.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/design/belgrade-design-week-2014-conferences-brand-new-world-10-05-2014/|title=belgrade design week 2014 conferences open up a brand new world|date=5 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, the conference also focuses on a common thread, for example, in 2013 the unifying theme was the square shape.&lt;ref name="glassrpske"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.glassrpske.com/plus/intervju/Jovan-Jelovac-Dizajn-nije-umetnost-nego-biznis/lat/110507.html|website=glassrpske.com|title=Jovan Jelovac: Dizajn nije umetnost nego biznis|accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately thirty international speakers present each year and cover a wide range of subjects, helping to promote cultural exchanges between Serbia and the rest of the world. Notable designers and artists who have spoken at the event include [[Konstantin Grcic]], [[Aylin Langreuter]], [[Christophe de la Fontaine]], [[Hella Jongerius]], [[Daan Roosegaarde]], [[Ross Lovegrove]]. [[Christophe Pillet]], [[Sacha Lakic]] and [[Patricia Urquiola]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to the presentations, there are numerous workshops and design competitions, as well as exhibits from designers such as Israeli Eilon Armon and Swiss architect duo Lang/Baumann.&lt;ref name="designboom.com"/&gt;

The '''Bureau International des Expositions''' ('''BIE''') is an intergovernmental organization created to supervise international exhibitions (also known as expos or [[world expo]]s) falling under the jurisdiction of the ''Convention Relating to International Exhibitions''.

==Founding and purpose==
The BIE was established by the Convention Relating to International Exhibitions, signed in [[Paris]] on 22 November 1928, with the following goals:
*to oversee the calendar, the bidding, the selection and the organization of World Expositions; and
*to establish a regulatory framework under which Expo organizers and participants may work together under the best conditions.

Today, 170 member countries have adhered to the BIE Convention.

The BIE regulates two types of expositions: Registered Exhibitions (commonly called World Expos) and Recognized Exhibitions (commonly called Specialized Expositions). Horticultural Exhibitions with an A1 grade, regulated by the [[AIPH|International Association of Horticultural Producers]], are recognized since 1960.

The Bureau International des Expositions also recognises the [[Triennale|Milan Triennial Exhibition of Decorative Arts and Modern Architecture]], on grounds of historical precedence, provided that it retains its original features.

==Expo Categories==
===History===
Since the creation of the BIE in 1928, different protocols have governed Expo categories, which are generally split between World Expos and Specialised Expos. The rules for each category define the duration, the frequency, the size, and the construction attributes of each Expo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/bie/our-history&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the original protocol of the 1928 Paris Convention, the BIE recognised two types of Expos:

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
* General Exhibitions (also known as World Expos), which were divided into:
(a) 1st category
(b) 2nd category 
* Special Exhibitions (also known as Specialised Expos)
{{col-end}}

The Protocol of 30 November 1972 revised the original Convention, entering into force in 1980. Under these new rules, two types of Expos were recognised:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
* World Exhibitions (also known as World Expos)
* Specialised Exhibitions (also known as Specialised Expos)
{{col-end}}

A new amendment was adopted in 1988 and ratified in 1996, further distinguishing the two types of Expos:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
* International Registered Exhibitions (commonly referred to as World Expos)
* International Recognised Exhibitions (commonly referred to as Specialised Expos)
{{col-end}}

[[Expo 2008]] [[Zaragoza]] was the first Specialised Expo to be organised under these new rules, which continue to be in force to this day.

The BIE may also grant recognition to A1 Horticultural Exhibitions approved by the [[International Association of Horticultural Producers]] (AIPH) since 1960, and to the [[Triennale di Milano]] since 1933.

===World Expos ===
According to the 1988 Amendment of the Convention on International Exhibitions, World Expos (formally known as International Registered Exhibitions) may occur every five years, and may last up to six months.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/expos/about-expos/expo-categories&lt;/ref&gt; Countries, international organizations, civil societies, and corporations are allowed to participate in World Expos.  The themes of World Expos address a universal challenge facing humanity, and international participants may design and build their own pavilions. Participants may also opt to customise a pavilion provided by the Organiser or to participate within a joint pavilion, which has lower participation costs. Examples of themes of recent World Expos include "Man and His World" for [[Expo '67]] in [[Montreal]], and "Discovery" for [[Seville Expo '92]], and examples of joint pavilion buildings for a Registered Exposition is the Plaza of America at Seville's Expo '92, which was constructed by the Seville Expo Authority to maximize participation at the fair by South American nations. The Plaza of Africa at Seville was constructed for the same purpose.

World Expos are also massive in scale, sometimes 300 or 400 hectares in size (Montreal's Expo 67 was 410 hectares, Osaka's [[Expo 70]] was 330 hectares, Seville's [[Seville Expo '92|Expo '92]] was 215 hectares and Shanghai's [[Expo 2010]], 528 hectares). Pavilions participating at a World Expo can also be large, sometimes 5,000 to 10,000 square metres in size, mini city blocks in themselves and sometimes more than several stories in height. (The Australia Pavilion for Shanghai 2010 was 5,000 square metres, the British Pavilion sat on a 6,000 square metres lot, as did the Canadian Pavilion. The flagship Chinese National Pavilion had 20,000 square metres of exhibition space.)

World Expos have been known to average 200,000 persons per day of visitors - or more - and some 50 to 70 million visitors during their six-month duration. Montreal's Expo 67 attracted 54 million visitors, [[Osaka]]'s [[Expo '70]], 64 million visitors, the Seville Expo '92, 41 million visitors and Shanghai's Expo 2010 attracted 70 million visitors.

As a result, transport and other infrastructure at a Registered Exposition is an important concern (Seville's World Expo of 1992 boasted [[Gondola lift|cable car]], [[monorail]], boat, and bus) and the overall cost for hosting and being represented at a World Expos is quite high, compared to the smaller-scale Specialised Expos.

===Specialised Expos ===
Specialised Expos (formally known as International Recognised Exhibitions) may occur between World Expos and may have a duration of between three weeks and three months. Countries, international organizations, civil societies, and corporations are allowed to participate but the theme of the Expo must address a precise challenge, e.g. Future Energy ([[Expo 2017]] Astana), or Living Oceans and the Coast ([[Expo 2012]] Yeosu). The pavilions are built by the Organiser and made available to participants who may customise them. The largest pavilion may be no larger than 1,000 square meters, and the Expo site must not exceed an area of twenty-five hectares. For this reason Specialised Expos are cheaper to run than World Expos.

==Member states==
170 countries are member states of the BIE:&lt;ref name=members&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/the-member-states-of-the-bie|title=The Member States|website=www.bie-paris.org|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former members===

====Australia====
[[Australia]] was a signatory to the treaty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1973/34.html|title=Agreement concerning the Voluntary Contributions to be Given for the Execution of the Project to Preserve Borobudur [1973] ATS 34|website=www3.austlii.edu.au|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the right to hold the [[World Expo 88|1988 World Exposition]].  In 2015 the [[Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry]] requested that the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)]] reconsider membership, as the cost was too high and "difficult to demonstrate an appropriate return on investment", and that membership be withdrawn temporarily in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://13-acci.cdn.aspedia.net/sites/default/files/uploaded-content/field_f_content_file/acci-submission-to-dfat_bie-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Australia is no longer listed as a member of BIE.&lt;ref name=members /&gt;

====Canada====
On October 16, 2012, the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative government]] ended Canada's membership of the BIE when the federal government cancelled its $25,000 per year membership fee as part of “reviewing all spending across government with the aim of reducing the deficit and returning to balanced budgets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Toronto’s World Expo 2025 bid dead after Prime Minister Stephen Harper government says no |author= |first= David |last= Rider |url= https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2012/10/23/torontos_world_expo_2025_bid_dead_after_prime_minister_stephen_harper_government_says_no.html |agency= |newspaper= The Star |publisher= |location= [[Toronto]] |date= April 29, 2012 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate= April 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejoined Members===

====United States (non member from 2001-17)====
Five world's fair events have been sanctioned by the BIE in the United States since World War II: one in the World Expo category - the [[Century 21 Exposition]] in [[Seattle]] (1962) - and four in the Specialized Expo category - [[HemisFair '68]] in [[San Antonio]], [[Expo '74]] in [[Spokane, Washington]], the [[1982 World's Fair]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] and the [[1984 Louisiana World Exposition]] in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name="biehome"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/home/history-of-expos|accessdate=2014-05-15|title=Expo Details}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The United States' membership in the BIE was revoked in June 2001&lt;ref&gt;https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/9708/Opening%20the%20X-Files-%20A%20Case%20for%20Rejoining%20the%20BIE.pdf%3Bsequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; due to non-allocation of funds by the [[U.S. Congress]] for two years. The withdrawal of the United States from the BIE had a limited impact on the BIE and on the participation of the United States in world's fairs: the country hosted pavilions at Specialised [[Expo 2005]] in [[Aichi Prefecture]], [[Japan]], World [[Expo 2010]] in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], Specialised [[Expo 2012]] in [[Yeosu]], [[South Korea]], and World [[Expo 2015]] in [[Milan]], [[Italy]].  However, the withdrawal "had strong, adverse consequences for states and localities that wish to host an exposition on U.S. soil. Organizers in at least four states have prepared bids, or are exploring the possibility of preparing bids to host a BIE-affiliated expo." In each case, the bid project was unsuccessful, with non-membership of the BIE hurting the chances of a U.S. bid moving forward. &lt;ref&gt;https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/9708/Opening%20the%20X-Files-%20A%20Case%20for%20Rejoining%20the%20BIE.pdf%3Bsequence=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. rejoined the organization on 10 May 2017&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/news-announcements/bie-activity/the-united-states-becomes-the-170th-member-state-of-the-bie&lt;/ref&gt; after President Trump signed the "U.S. Wants to Compete for a World Expo Act" (HR534) into law (Pub.L. 115-32)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/534&lt;/ref&gt; as Minnesota was looking to host a Specialized Expo in 2023.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5418">'''Chemesthesis''' is defined as the chemical sensibility of the skin and mucous membranes. Chemesthetic sensations arise when [[chemical compound]]s activate [[Sensory receptor|receptor]]s associated with other [[sense]]s that mediate [[pain]], [[touch]], and [[Thermoception|thermal perception]]. These chemical-induced reactions do not fit into the traditional sense categories of [[taste]] and [[Olfaction|smell]].  Examples of chemesthetic sensations include the burn-like irritation from [[capsaicin]] and related compounds in foods like [[chili pepper]]s; the coolness of [[menthol]] in mouthwashes and topical analgesic creams; the stinging or tingling of [[carbonated beverages]] in the nose and mouth;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wise|first=Paul M.|last2=Wolf|first2=Madeline|last3=Thom|first3=Stephen R.|last4=Bryant|first4=Bruce|date=2013-08-21|title=The Influence of Bubbles on the Perception Carbonation Bite|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0071488|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=8|issue=8|pages=e71488|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0071488|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3749224|pmid=23990956|bibcode=2013PLoSO...871488W}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tear-induction of cut onions;&lt;ref name="Lawless"&gt;{{cite book |author= H.

Chemesthetic sensations sometimes arise by direct chemical activation of ion channels on sensory nerve fibers, for example of [[transient receptor potential channel]]s including those of the [[TRPV]], [[TRPA (channel)|TRPA]] or [[TRPM]] subtypes.  Alternatively, irritant chemicals may activate cells of the epithelium to release substances that indirectly activate the nerve fibers.  The respiratory passages, including the nose and trachea, possess specialized cells called [[solitary chemosensory cells]]&lt;ref name="Finger"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Finger TE, Böttger B, Hansen A |title=Solitary chemoreceptor cells in the nasal cavity serve as sentinels of respiration |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=100 |issue=15 |pages=8981–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12857948 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1531172100|postscript=.|pmc=166424|bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.8981F |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; which release [[acetylcholine]]&lt;ref name="Krasteva"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Krasteva G, Canning BJ, Hartmann P |title=Cholinergic chemosensory cells in the trachea regulate breathing |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=108 |issue=23 |pages=9478–83 |year=2011 |pmid=21606356 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1019418108|postscript=.|pmc=3111311|bibcode = 2011PNAS..108.9478K |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other activators to excite nearby nerve fibers.

Because chemoresponsive nerve fibers are present in all types of skin, chemesthetic sensations can be aroused from anywhere on the body's surface as well as from mucosal surfaces in the nose, mouth, eyes, etc. Mucus membranes are generally more sensitive to chemesthetic stimuli because they lack the barrier function of [[Stratum corneum|cornified skin]].

Much of the chemesthetic flavor sensations are mediated by the [[trigeminal nerves]], which are relatively large and important nerves.  Flavors that stimulate the trigeminal nerves are therefore important - for example, carbon dioxide is the trigeminal stimulant in carbonated beverages.&lt;ref name="Lawless" /&gt;

                         IMPORTANT!!!

This article includes a list of songs compiled in September 2001.  Because it is
a historical list, it does not actually change over time; it is not something new
contributions are made to.

Don't add songs that are not listed in a reliable source as having been on the list in
September 2001, such as the Slate and Snopes pieces given in this article as references.

It is very unlikely that you have discovered a song not already in this article, although of course, if you have a new reliable source that confirms that you have, you should add the new song and the source you're citing.

Any change without a confirming reliable source WILL BE REVERTED.

--&gt;
Following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Clear Channel Communications (now [[iHeartMedia]]), the largest owner of [[radio station]]s in the United States, circulated an internal memo containing a list of songs that program directors felt were "lyrically questionable" to play in the aftermath of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lipmagazine.org/articles/featwishnia_142.shtml |title=Bad Transmission: Clear Channel's Hit List |publisher=''[[LiP magazine]]'' |work=Reviews |date=October 24, 2001 |accessdate=January 18, 2011 |last=Wishnia |first=Steven |archiveurl=https://archive.li/20080416014917/http://www.lipmagazine.org/articles/featwishnia_142.shtml |archivedate=April 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time immediately after the attacks, many television and radio stations altered normal programming in response to the events, and the rumor spread that Clear Channel and its subsidiaries had established a list of songs with lyrics Clear Channel deemed "questionable." The list was not a demand not to play the songs listed, but rather a suggestion that they "might not want to play these songs." The list was made public by the independent newsletter ''Hits Daily Double'', which is not affiliated with iHeartMedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  |accessdate=May 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Snopes.com]]'' did research on the subject and concluded that the list did exist as a suggestion for radio stations but noted that it was not an outright ban on the songs in question.&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/rumors/radio.asp|title=Radio, Radio|publisher=''[[Snopes.com]]''| date=September 18, 2001|accessdate=May 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compiled list was the subject of media attention around the time of its release.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;

The list contains 165 suggestions, including a single suggestion for all songs by [[Rage Against the Machine]] as well as certain songs recorded by multiple artists (for example "[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]" by [[Guns N' Roses]] and the original version by [[Bob Dylan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Truitt|first=Eliza|title=It's the End of the World as Clear Channel Knows It|publisher=''[[Slate.com]]''|date=September 17, 2001|url=http://slate.com/id/1008314/|accessdate=September 14, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071015200337/http://slate.com/id/1008314/| archivedate= October 15, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} Slate published what it claimed was a copy of the list.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, only certain versions of songs were included on the list. For example, the [[cover version|cover]] of "[[Smooth Criminal]]" by [[Alien Ant Farm]] is on the list while the original [[Michael Jackson]] recording is not. Similarly, [[J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers|J. Frank Wilson]]'s version of "[[Last Kiss]]" is included, but [[Pearl Jam]]'s cover is not. Also, [[Martha and the Vandellas]]'s original version of "[[Dancing in the Street]]" and [[Van Halen]]'s version are included; [[David Bowie]] and [[Mick Jagger]]'s recording was excluded from the list. Also, the song "[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]" by [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]] is included, but the version by the song's composer [[John Denver]] is not. [[AC/DC (band)|AC/DC]] has the most individual songs listed, with seven.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36161">'''Design thinking''' refers to the cognitive, strategic and practical processes by which design concepts (proposals for new products, buildings, machines, etc.) are developed by designers and/or design teams. Many of the key concepts and aspects of design thinking have been identified through studies, across different design domains, of design cognition and design activity in both laboratory and natural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Visser, W. 2006, The cognitive artifacts of designing, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cross |first1=Nigel |title=Design Cognition: Results from Protocol and other Empirical Studies of Design Activity |date=2001 |pages=79–103 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978008043868950005X |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design thinking is also associated with prescriptions for the innovation of products and services within business and social contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Brown. Design Thinking. Harvard Business Review, June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorst Frame Innovation"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dorst|first1=Kees|title=Frame Innovation: Create new thinking by design|date=2012|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-262-32431-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these prescriptions have been criticized for oversimplifying the design process and trivializing the role of technical knowledge and skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Design-Thinking-Is-a/243472|title=Design Thinking Is a Boondoggle|date=2018-05-21|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==As a process for designing==
Design thinking encompasses processes such as context analysis, problem finding and framing, ideation and solution generating, creative thinking, sketching and drawing, modelling and prototyping, testing and evaluating.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Cross |first1=Nigel |title=Design thinking : understanding how designers think and work |publisher=Berg |date=2011 |isbn=9781847886361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Core features of design thinking include abilities to:
* resolve ill-defined or 'wicked' problems
* adopt solution-focused strategies
* use abductive/productive reasoning
* employ non-verbal, graphic/spatial modelling media.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. "The Nature and Nurture of Design Ability", ''Design Studies'', '''11''' (1990) 127–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wicked problems===
Design thinking is especially useful when addressing what [[Horst Rittel]] and [[Melvin Webber]] referred to as ''[[wicked problems]]'', which are ill-defined or tricky (as opposed to wicked in the sense of [[:wikt:malice|malicious]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rittel|first1=Horst|first2=Melvin|last2=Webber|title=Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning. ''Policy Sciences'' 4.2 (1973): 155–69|url=http://www.metu.edu.tr/~baykan/arch467/Rittel%2BWebber%2BDilemmas.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas for "tame" or "well-defined" problems the problem is clear, and the solution is available through applying rules or technical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Beinecke, Richard. "Leadership for Wicked Problems." ''The Innovation Journal'' 14.1 (2009): 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem framing===
Rather than accept the problem as given, designers explore the given problem and its context and may re-interpret or restructure the given problem in order to reach a particular framing of the problem that suggests a route to a solution.&lt;ref&gt;Schön, Donald A. ''The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals Think in Action.'' New York: Basic, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorst, K. (2011) "The Core of Design Thinking and its Application", ''Design Studies'', '''32''', 521-532.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solution-focused thinking===
In empirical studies of three-dimensional problem solving, Bryan Lawson found architects employed solution-focused cognitive strategies, distinct from the problem-focused strategies of scientists.&lt;ref name="lawson_1979"&gt;Lawson, Bryan. 1979. "Cognitive Strategies in Architectural Design". ''Ergonomics'', 22, 59–68 &lt;/ref&gt; [[Nigel Cross]] suggests that 'Designers tend to use solution conjectures as the means of developing their understanding of the problem'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cross |first1=Nigel |title=Expertise in Design: an overview |journal=Design Studies |date=2004 |volume=25 |pages=427-441}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Abductive reasoning===
The creative mode of reasoning in design thinking is [[abductive reasoning]], rather than the more familiar forms of inductive and deductive reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;March, L.J. (1984) "The Logic of Design" in ''The Architecture of Form'', Cambridge University Press, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kolko, J. (2010) "Abductive Thinking and Sensemaking: Drivers of Design Synthesis", ''Design Issues'', vol. 26, 15–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{Anchor|Co-evolution of problem-solution}}Co-evolution of problem–solution===
In the process of designing the designer's attention typically oscillates between their understanding of the problematic context and their ideas for a solution in a process of co-evolution of problem and solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dorst |first1=Kees |last2=Cross |first2=Nigel |title=Creativity in the design process: co-evolution of problem–solution |journal=Design Studies |date=2001 |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=425–437 |doi=10.1016/S0142-694X(01)00009-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wiltschnig |first1=Stefan |last2=Christensen |first2=Bo |last3=Ball |first3=Linden |title=Collaborative problem–solution co-evolution in creative design |journal=Design Studies |date=2013 |volume=34 |pages=515 - 542}}&lt;/ref&gt; New solution ideas can lead to a deeper or alternative understanding of the problematic context, which in turn triggers more solution ideas.

===Representations and modelling===
Conventionally, designers communicate mostly in [[visual language|visual or object languages]] to translate abstract requirements into concrete objects.&lt;ref name="cross_1982"&gt;Cross, Nigel. "Designerly Ways of Knowing." ''Design Studies'' 3.4 (1982): 221–27.&lt;/ref&gt; These 'languages' include traditional sketches and drawings but also extend to computer models and physical prototypes. The use of representations and models is closely associated with features of design thinking such as the generation and exploration of tentative solution concepts, the identification of what needs to be known about the developing concept, and the recognition of emergent features and properties within the representations. &lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. 1999. "Natural Intelligence in Design", ''Design Studies'', '''20''', 25-39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suwa, M., Gero, J. and Purcell, T. 2000. "Unexpected discoveries and S-invention of design requirements: Important vehicles for a design process". ''Design Studies'', '''21''', 539-567.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a process for innovation==
[[File:DesignThinking.ogv|thumb|Design thinking example video that presents design thinking for innovation in business and society as a process of "Learn from People, Find Patterns, Design Principles, Make Tangible and Iterate Relentlessly"]]

An alternative five-phase description of design process is described by Plattner, Meinel and Leifer as: ''(re)defining the problem, needfinding and benchmarking, ideating, building, testing''.&lt;ref name="Plattneretal"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Plattner |editor1-first=Hasso |editor1-link=Hasso Plattner |editor2-last=Meinel |editor2-first=Christoph |editor3-last=Leifer |editor3-first=Larry J. |date=2011 |title=Design thinking: understand, improve, apply |series=Understanding innovation |location=Berlin; Heidelberg |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LAbIwOwHz1MC&amp;pg=PR14 xiv–xvi] |isbn=3-642-13756-3 |oclc=898322632 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-13757-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plattner, Meinel and Leifer state: "While the stages are simple enough, the adaptive expertise required to choose the right inflection points and appropriate next stage is a high order intellectual activity that requires practice and is learnable."

The process may also be thought of as a system of overlapping spaces rather than a sequence of orderly steps: inspiration, ideation, and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, T. 2008. Design Thinking. Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt; Projects may loop back through inspiration, ideation, and implementation more than once as the team refines its ideas and explores new directions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Brown, T. Wyatt, J. 2010.  Design thinking for social innovation. Stanford social innovation review.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inspiration===
Generally, the design process starts with the inspiration phase: understanding the problem or the opportunity. This understanding can be documented in a brief which includes constraints that gives the project team a framework from which to begin, benchmarks by which they can measure progress, and a set of objectives to be realized—such as price point, available technology, and market segment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

====Empathy====
Both Tom and David Kelley have stated that design thinking begins with empathy.&lt;ref&gt;http://cultureofempathy.com/References/Experts/David-Kelley.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Designers should approach users with the goal of understanding their wants and needs, what might make their life easier and more enjoyable and how technology can be useful for them. Empathic design transcends physical ergonomics to include understanding the psychological and emotional needs of people—the way they do things, why and how they think and feel about the world, and what is meaningful to them.

===Ideation: Divergent and convergent thinking===
[[Ideation (creative process)|Ideation]] is idea generation. The process is characterized by the alternation of divergent and convergent thinking, typical of design thinking process. 

To achieve divergent thinking, it may be important to have a diverse group of people involved in the process. Design teams typically begin with a structured [[brainstorming]] process of "thinking outside the box". Convergent thinking, on the other hand, aims for zooming and focusing on the different proposals to select the best choice, which permits continuation of the design thinking process to achieve the final goals.

After collecting and sorting lots of ideas, a team goes through a process of synthesis in which it has to translate ideas into insights that can lead to solutions or opportunities for change. These might be either visions of new product offerings, or choices among various ways of creating new experiences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Implementation and prototyping===
The third space of the design thinking innovation process is implementation, when the best ideas generated during ideation are turned into something concrete.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

At the core of the implementation process is prototyping: turning ideas into actual products and services that are then tested, iterated, and refined. A prototype helps to gather feedback and improve the idea. Prototypes speed up the process of innovation because they allow one to understand strengths and weaknesses of new solutions.

== Application ==

===In business===
Historically, designers tended to be involved only in the later parts of the process of [[new product development]], focusing their attention on the aesthetics and functionality of products. Many businesses and other organisations now realise the utility of embedding design as a productive asset throughout organisational policies and practices, and design thinking has been used to help many different types of business and social organisations to be more constructive and innovative.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Tim, and Barry Kātz. ''Change by Design: How Design Thinking Transforms Organizations and Inspires Innovation.'' New York: Harper Business, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorst Frame Innovation"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dorst|first1=Kees|title=Frame Innovation: Create new thinking by design|date=2012|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-262-32431-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s there was a significant growth of interest in design thinking as a catalyst for gaining competitive advantage within business,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Tim. "Design Thinking"." ''Harvard Business Review'', June 2008, pp. 85–92.&lt;/ref&gt; but doubts around design thinking as a panacea for success have also been expressed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kolko, J.

===In computer science===
Design thinking has been central to [[user-centered design]] and [[human-centered design]]—the dominant methods of designing human-computer interfaces—for over 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Norman |first1=Donald A. |title=User Centered System Design |journal=Taylor &amp; Francis |date=1 January 1986 |doi=10.1201/b15703 |url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780898598728 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design thinking is also central to recent conceptions of software development in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ralph |first1=Paul |title=The Sensemaking-Coevolution-Implementation Theory of software design |journal=Science of Computer Programming |date=April 2015 |volume=101 |pages=21–41 |doi=10.1016/j.scico.2014.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In education===
All forms of professional design education can be assumed to be developing design thinking in students, even if only implicitly, but design thinking is also now explicitly taught in general as well as professional education, across all sectors of education. Design as a subject was introduced into secondary schools' educational curricula in the UK in the 1970s, gradually replacing and/or developing from some of the traditional art and craft subjects, and increasingly linked with technology studies. This development sparked related research studies in both education and design.&lt;ref&gt;Archer L. B. et al. (1979) "Design in General Education". London: The Royal College of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cross_1982" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owen-Jackson, G. (ed.) (2002) "Teaching Design and Technology in Secondary Schools", London: Routledge Falmer.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the K-12 sector, design thinking is used to promote creative thinking, teamwork, and student responsibility for learning.&lt;ref&gt;Razzouk, R. and Shute, V. (2012) "What Is Design Thinking and Why Is It Important?" ''Review of Educational Research'', 82, 330–348&lt;/ref&gt; New courses in design thinking have also been introduced at university level, especially where linked with business and innovation studies. A notable early course of this type was introduced at [[Stanford University]] in 2003, the [[Hasso Plattner Institute of Design]], known as the d.school.

==History==
Developing [[creativity]] techniques in the 1950s and new [[design methods]] in the 1960s led to the idea of design thinking as a particular approach to creatively solving problems. Among the first authors to write about design thinking were [[John E. Arnold]] in "Creative Engineering" (1959) and [[L. Bruce Archer]] in "Systematic Method for Designers" (1965).&lt;ref name="Arnold_1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer, L. Bruce 1965"/&gt;

[[John E. Arnold]] was one of the first authors to use the term 'design thinking'. In "Creative Engineering" (1959) he distinguishes four areas of design thinking.&lt;ref name="Arnold_1959"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=J.E.|title=Creative Engineering: Promoting Innovation by Thinking Differently. Edited With an Introduction and Biographical Essay by William J. Clancey|publisher=Stanford Digital Repository|year=2016|orig-year=1959|url=https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:jb100vs5745/Creative%20Engineering%20-%20John%20E.%20Arnold.pdf |accessdate=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Arnold, design thinking can yield (1) novel functionality, i.e. solutions that satisfy a novel need or solutions that satisfy an old need in an entirely new way, (2) higher performance levels of a solution, (3) lower production costs or (4) increased salability. Thus, according to this early concept, 'design thinking' covers all forms of product innovation, including especially incremental innovation ("higher performance") and radical innovation ("novel functionality").&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=von Thienen|first=J.P.A.|last2=Clancey|first2=W.J.|last3=Corazza|first3=G.E.|last4=Meinel|first4=C.|title=Design thinking research. Making distinctions: Collaboration versus cooperation|place=Cham|publisher=Springer|series=Understanding Innovation|year=2017|chapter=Theoretical foundations of design thinking. Part I: John E. Arnold's creative thinking theories|editor-last=Plattner|editor-first=H.|editor2-last=Meinel|editor2-first=C.|editor3-last=Leifer|editor3-first=L.|pages=13–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold recommends a balanced approach: Product developers should seek opportunities in all four areas of design thinking. 

{{quote|It is rather interesting to look over the developmental history of any product or family of products and try to classify the changes into one of the four areas&amp;nbsp;... Your group, too, might have gotten into a rut and is inadvertently doing all of your ''design thinking'' in one area and is missing good bets in other areas.|J.E. Arnold|1959/2016|p. 119&lt;ref name="Arnold_1959" /&gt;}}

Although [[L. Bruce Archer]]'s "Systematic Method for Designers" (1965)&lt;ref name="Archer, L. Bruce 1965" /&gt; was concerned primarily with a systematic process of designing, it also expressed a need to broaden the scope of conventional design: "Ways have had to be found to incorporate knowledge of ergonomics, cybernetics, marketing and management science into ''design thinking''". Archer was also developing the relationship of design thinking with management: "The time is rapidly approaching when design decision making and management decision making techniques will have so much in common that the one will become no more than the extension of the other".&lt;ref&gt;Archer, L. Bruce. "Design Management" ''Management Decision'' 1.4 (1967): 47–51.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The notion of design as a "way of thinking" in [[science|the sciences]] can be traced to [[Herbert A. Simon]]'s 1969 book ''The Sciences of the Artificial'',&lt;ref name="simon_1969"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sciences of the Artificial|last=Simon|first=Herbert|publisher=MIT Press|year=1969|location=Cambridge|authorlink=Herbert A. Simon|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[design engineering]] to Robert McKim's 1973 book ''Experiences in Visual Thinking''.&lt;ref name="mckim_1973"&gt;{{cite book|title=Experiences in Visual Thinking|last=McKim|first=Robert|publisher=Brooks/Cole Publishing Co|year=1973|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan Lawson's 1980 book ''How Designers Think'', primarily addressing design in architecture, began a process of generalising the concept of design thinking.&lt;ref name="lawson_1980"&gt;Lawson, Bryan. ''How Designers Think: The Design Process Demystified.'' London: Architectural, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; A 1982 article by [[Nigel Cross]] on ''Designerly ways of knowing'' established some of the intrinsic qualities and abilities of design thinking that also made it relevant in general education and thus for wider audiences.&lt;ref name="cross_1982" /&gt; Peter Rowe's 1987 book ''Design Thinking'', which described methods and approaches used by architects and urban planners, was a significant early usage of the term in the design research literature.&lt;ref name="rowe_1987"&gt;{{cite book|title=Design Thinking|last=Rowe|first=G. Peter|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0-262-68067-7|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; An international series of research symposia in design thinking began at [[Delft University of Technology]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N., Dorst, K. and N., Roozenburg (eds.) (1992) Research in Design Thinking, Delft University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. (2018) A Brief History of the Design Thinking Research Symposium Series, ''Design Studies'' vol 57, 160–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rolf Faste]] expanded on McKim's work at [[Stanford University]] in the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref name="faste_1993"&gt;Faste, Rolf, Bernard Roth and Douglass J. Wilde, [http://fastefoundation.org/publications/integrating_creativity_into_the_ME_curriculum.pdf "Integrating Creativity into the Mechanical Engineering Curriculum"], Cary A.

"...&amp;nbsp;design thinking is any process that applies the methods of industrial designers to problems beyond how a product should look. My mentor at Stanford, Rolf Faste, did more than anyone to define the term and express the unique role that designers could play in making pretty much everything."&lt;/ref&gt; Design thinking was adapted for business purposes by Faste's Stanford colleague [[David M. Kelley]], who founded the design consultancy [[IDEO]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Tim. "The Making of a Design Thinker." ''Metropolis'' Oct. 2009: 60–62. p. 60: "David Kelley&amp;nbsp;... said that every time someone came to ask him about design, he found himself inserting the word thinking to explain what it is that designers do. The term design thinking stuck."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Buchanan (academic)|Richard Buchanan]]'s 1992 article "Wicked Problems in Design Thinking" expressed a broader view of design thinking as addressing intractable human concerns through design.&lt;ref name="buchanan_1992"&gt;Buchanan, Richard, "Wicked Problems in Design Thinking," ''Design Issues'', vol. 8, no. 2, Spring 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Timeline ===
{|class="wikitable"
|-
| pre-1960 || The origins of design thinking partially lie in the development of creativity techniques in the 1950s. Harold van Doren published ''Industrial Design – A Practical Guide to Product Design and Development'', which includes discussions of design methods and practices, in 1940. [[John E. Arnold]] began teaching about creativity at MIT in 1951 and began teaching at Stanford in 1957.
|-
| early 1960s || The first notable books on methods of creativity are published by [[William J. J. Gordon]]  (1961)&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, William J. J. ''Synectics, the Development of Creative Capacity.'' New York: Harper, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alex Faickney Osborn]] (1963).&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, Alex F. ''Applied Imagination: Principles and Procedures of Creative Thinking.'' New York: Scribner, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1962 Conference on Systematic and Intuitive Methods in Engineering, Industrial Design, Architecture and Communications, London, UK, started interest studying design processes and developing new design methods.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J. C. and D. G. Thornley, (eds.) ''Conference on Design Methods.'' Oxford, UK: Pergamon Press, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

Books on methods and theories of design in different fields are published by [[Morris Asimow]] (1962) ([[engineering]]),&lt;ref&gt;Asimow, Morris. ''Introduction to Design.'' Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Alexander]] (1964) ([[architecture]]),&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Christopher. ''Notes on the Synthesis of Form.'' Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; [[L. Bruce Archer]] (1965) ([[industrial design]]),&lt;ref name="Archer, L. Bruce 1965"&gt;Archer, L. Bruce. ''Systematic Method for Designers.'' Council of Industrial Design, H.M.S.O., 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Chris Jones]] (1970) ([[product design |product]] and [[systems design]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jones, John Christopher. ''Design Methods.'' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| 1965 || [[L. Bruce Archer]] argues that design is "not merely a craft-based skill but should be considered a knowledge-based discipline in its own right, with rigorous methodology and research principles incorporated into the design process".&lt;ref name="Archer, L. Bruce 1965"/&gt;
|-
| 1969 || [[Herbert A. Simon]], notable for his research in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences, proposes a "science of design" that would be "a body of intellectually tough, analytic, partly formalizable, partly empirical, teachable doctrine about the design process."&lt;ref name="simon_1969"/&gt;
|- 
| 1972 || Don Koberg and Jim Bagnall pioneer a 'soft systems' design process for dealing with the problems of 'everyday life' in their book ''The Universal Traveler''.&lt;ref&gt;Koberg, Don, and Jim Bagnall. ''The Universal Traveler: A Soft-Systems Guide to Creativity, Problem-Solving, and the Process of Design.'' Los Altos, CA: Kaufmann, 1972. 2nd edition (1981): ''The All New Universal Traveler: A Soft-Systems Guide to Creativity, Problem-Solving, and the Process of Reaching Goals''.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| 1973 || Robert McKim publishes ''Experiences in Visual Thinking'',&lt;ref name="mckim_1973" /&gt; which includes "Express, Test, Cycle" (ETC) as an iterative backbone for design processes.

[[Horst Rittel]] and [[Melvin Webber]] publish "Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning" showing that design and planning problems are wicked problems as opposed to "tame", single disciplinary, problems of science.
|-
| 1979 || [[L. Bruce Archer]] extends inquiry into designerly ways of knowing, claiming: "There exists a designerly way of thinking and communicating that is both different from scientific and scholarly ways of thinking and communicating, and as powerful as scientific and scholarly methods of inquiry when applied to its own kinds of problems."&lt;ref&gt;Archer, L. Bruce. "Whatever Became of Design Methodology?" ''Design Studies'' 1.1 (1979): 17–20.&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Design Studies", the first research journal focussing on design processes begins publishing.
|-
| 1980s || Systematic engineering design methods are developed, particularly in Germany and Japan. The International Conferences on Engineering Design (ICED) is formed.

Several books on engineering design methods are published, by Hubka (1982),&lt;ref&gt;Hubka, Vladimir, and W. E. Eder. ''Principles of Engineering Design.'' London: Butterworth Scientific, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Pahl and Beitz (1984),&lt;ref&gt;Beitz, Wolfgang, and Gerhard Pahl (ed. Ken Wallace). ''Engineering Design: a systematic approach.'' London: Design Council, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; French (1985),&lt;ref&gt;French, M. J. ''Conceptual Design for Engineers.'' London: Design Council, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nigel Cross|Cross]] (1989),&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Nigel. ''Engineering Design Methods.'' England: Wiley, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stuart Pugh|Pugh]] (1991).&lt;ref&gt;Pugh, Stuart. ''Total Design: Integrated Methods for Successful Product Engineering.'' Wokingham, England: Addison-Wesley Pub., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA, the [[National Science Foundation]] initiative on design theory and methods led to substantial growth in engineering design methods in the late-1980s. The [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) launched its series of conferences on design theory and methodology.

The 1980s also sees the rise of [[human-centered design]] and the rise of design-centered business management. 
|-
| 1980 || Bryan Lawson publishes ''How Designers Think'' about design cognition in the context of architecture and urban planning.&lt;ref name="lawson_1980"/&gt;
|-
| 1983 || [[Donald Schön]] publishes ''The Reflective Practitioner'' in which he sought to establish "an epistemology of practice implicit in the artistic, intuitive processes that [design and other] practitioners bring to situations of uncertainty, instability, uniqueness and value conflict."&lt;ref&gt;Schön, Donald A. ''The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals Think in Action.'' New York: Basic, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; 
|-
| 1986 || The business management strategy [[Six Sigma]] emerges as a way to streamline the design process for quality control and profit. 
|-
| 1987 || Peter Rowe publishes ''Design Thinking'', focused on architecture and planning.&lt;ref name="rowe_1987"/&gt;
|-
| 1988 || [[Rolf Faste]] publishes "Ambidextrous Thinking", extending McKim's process of visual thinking to design as a "whole-body way of doing."&lt;ref name="faste_1994"/&gt;
|-
| 1991 || The first symposium on Research in Design Thinking is held at Delft University, The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N., Dorst, K. and N., Roozenburg (eds.) (1992) Research in Design Thinking, Delft University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IDEO]] design consultancy formed by combining three industrial design companies. They are one of the first design companies to showcase their design process, which draws heavily on the [[Stanford University]] curriculum.
|-
| 1992 || Richard Buchanan's article "Wicked Problems in Design Thinking" is published.&lt;ref name="buchanan_1992" /&gt;

Eugene S. Ferguson's book ''[[Engineering and the Mind's Eye]]'' is published.
|-

|-
| 21st Century || The start of the 21st century brought a significant increase in interest in design thinking as the term becomes popularized in the business press. Books about how to create a more design-focused workplace where innovation can thrive are written for the business sector by [[Richard Florida]] (2002),&lt;ref&gt;Florida, Richard L. ''The Rise of the Creative Class: and How It's Transforming Work, Leisure, Community and Everyday Life.'' New York, NY: Basic, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Pink]] (2006),&lt;ref&gt;Pink, Daniel H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2877">'''Elisa Serna''' (7 March 1943 – 4 September 2018) was a Spanish singer-songwriter, member of the avant-garde of [[protest song]] in Spain in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aplomez.blogspot.com/2014/05/elisa-serna-autobiografia-y-cancion.html Elisa Serna.

She began her artistic career integrating herself in the group ''Canción del pueblo'', in her native Madrid, along with singer-songwriters like Hilario Camacho. In 1970, through her friendship with "Las madres del cordero", she joined the independent theater group ''Tábano''', during the performances of ''Castañuela 70'' at the Teatro de la Comedia in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trancón |first=Santiago |date=2006 |title=Castañuela 70 |trans-title= |url= |language=Spanish |location=Madrid |publisher=Prosopon Editeroes |isbn=9788493430740}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year she settled in Paris, receiving influences of folk music from areas as disparate as the Maghreb, Turkey or India. Her first LP, ''Quejido'', was released in 1972, with a production by [[Paco Ibáñez]], who had known her when she heard her sing in the Parisian café ''La Contrescarpe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=2000 |title=Pop Español |trans-title= |url= |language=Spanish |location=Barcelona |publisher=Ediciones Orbis S.A|volume=3|page=200 |isbn=8440224494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Spain, in 1973, she was arrested for subversion and upon her release from prison she was [[Censorship in Francoist Spain|banned]] from offering concerts and recitals. Her first album could not be published in the Spanish market until two years later, under the title of ''Este tiempo ha de acabar'' (''This time has to end'') and the songs ''Esta gente qué querrá'' (''These people will want'') and ''Los reyes de la baraja'' (''The kings of the deck'') were censored.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8044">{{History of Greek art}}

The most important artistic movement of [[Greek art]] in the 19th century was [[academic realism]], often called in Greece "the [[Munich School]]" ({{lang-el|Σχολή του Μονάχου}}) because of the strong influence from the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Munich]] ({{lang-de|Münchner Akademie der Bildenden Künste}}),&lt;ref name=pit&gt;[http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en/bank/Exhibition_Vlachos.asp Bank of Greece - Events&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624035222/http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en/bank/Exhibition_Vlachos.asp |date=2007-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where many Greek artists trained.  The Munich School painted the same sort of scenes in the same sort of style as Western European academic painters in several countries, and did generally not attempt to incorporate Byzantine stylistic elements into their work.

== History ==
The creation of [[romanticism|romantic art]] in [[Greece]] can be explained mainly due to the particular relationships that were created between recently liberated Greece (1830) and [[Bavaria]] during [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]]'s years (''See'':[[Kingdom of Greece]]). In this period the [[Greek state]] was encouraging young artists to study at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Munich]] and in particular study [[painting]].&lt;ref name=kat&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.gr/html/en/ektheseis/paris_athens.htm New Page 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, after centuries of Ottoman rule, few opportunities existed for young artist in Greece itself, immediately after independence, so studying abroad was imperative for them. Munich was an important international center for the arts and was the place where the majority of Greek artists of the 19th century would choose to study; a minority would go to [[Paris]]. Both academic and personal bonds developed between early Greek painters and Munich artistry, giving birth to the Greek "Munich School" of painting. Many of these young artists later returned to Greece to teach at the [[Polytechnic School]] and later [[Athens School of Fine Arts]], where they would transmit their artistic experiences. Some of them, like [[Nikolaus Gysis]], chose to remain in Munich, the so-called ''Athens on the [[Isar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.auth.gr/teloglion/exhibitions/munich/munich.en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic styles ==

The works of the Munich school painters are characterized by an expert but over-use of colours that would overshadow the figures' expressions. Scenes were depicted in a pompous and theatrical way, although not lacking in emotional tension. In [[academic realism]] the imperative is the [[ethography]], the representation of urban and/or rural life with a special attention in the depiction of architectural elements, the traditional cloth and the various objects. Munich School painters were specialized on [[portrait painting|portraiture]], [[landscape painting]] and [[still life]].

== Representative artists ==
[[Image:Eros and the painter - gysis.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Nikolaus Gysis]], ''Eros and the Painter''.]]

Artists belonging to the Munich School include the first painters of free Greece, such as [[Theodoros Vryzakis]] (1814–1878) and [[Dionysios Tsokos]] (1820–1862). (According to other art critics, he belongs more to the [[Heptanese School (painting)|Heptanese School]]). Both of them draw their subjects from the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821, focusing on idealised ideas on the [[Greek Revolution]] and not giving much attention to the violent and tragic aspects of a war. Even more dramatic in their depictions were the later [[Konstantinos Volanakis]] (1837–1907) and [[Ioannis Altamouras]] (1852–1878), who were focused more on the naval battles of the [[1821 Revolution]].&lt;ref name=pit/&gt;

Main representatives of the artistic movement were apart from [[Konstantinos Volanakis|Volanakis]] the painters who worked mainly during the second half of the 19th century like [[Nikiphoros Lytras]] (1832–1904), [[Nikolaos Gysis]] (1842–1901), [[Georgios Iacovidis]]. (1853–1907), and [[Georgios Roilos]] (1867–1928). In his mature career Roilos went beyond the principles of the Munich School and introduced impressionism into Greek painting. [[Nikolaos Gysis|Gysis]] stayed at the Academy in Germany while the others have returned to teach at the [[Athens School of Fine Arts]]. Their teaching and artistry have marked the 19th-century artistic era in Greece.&lt;ref name=kat/&gt;

[[Nikiphoros Lytras]] is considered the pope of Greek painting and the major iconographer of Greek life during the 19th century. Paintings such as ''The milkman'' or ''The awaiting'' consist reference points in [[Greek art]]. [[Nikolaos Gysis|Gysis]] worked mainly on [[ethography]] while at the maturity of his career he shifted towards the iconography of visions, allegories and symbolisms. [[Georgios Iacovidis|Iacovidis]] paintings were mainly [[portrait painting|portraiture]] and depiction of children scenes. The latter was the founder and first curator of the [[National Gallery of Greece]] in [[Athens]].&lt;ref name=pit/&gt;

Other painters include [[Epameinondas Thomopoulos]], [[Ioannis Koutsis]], [[Stylianos Miliadis]], [[Nikolaos Vokos]], [[Ioannis Zacharias]] (1845–?) and [[Polychronis Lembesis]]. Influences of [[academic realism]] can also be seen in the work of many Greek artists such as [[Spyridon Vikatos]] (1878–1960), [[Nikolaos Davis]] (1883-1967), [[Thalia Flora-Karavia]] (1871–1960), [[Ioannis Doukas]] (1841-1916) and [[Ektor Doukas]] (1886–1969).&lt;ref name=kat/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Towards the formation of a professional identity: women artists in Greece at the beginning of the twentieth century'' (2005) Chariklia-Glafki Gotsia [[Women's History Review]], 14;pp: 285 - 300&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the movement started when some Greek painters after the mid-19th century such as [[Periclis Pantazis]] (1849–1884) departed from academic realism towards impressionism and the final end occurred when expressionist [[Nikolaos Lytras]] (1883–1927), Georgios Roilos, and [[Konstantinos Parthenis]] (1878–1967) started to teach at the Athens School of Fine Arts.&lt;ref name=pit/&gt;

The show was nominated twice for the NAACP Image Award and won two Parent's Choice Awards.  Ron, a native of St. Helena Island, S.C., and Natalie Daise have been performing together since 1983 and were married in 1985.

''Gullah Gullah Island'' is a sing-along half-hour live-action show.&lt;ref name=CH2 /&gt;  The format was part of a "flexible thinking" initiative that taught children to make good choices rather than using rote memorization.&lt;ref name=BBMag /&gt;&lt;ref name=Trib&gt;{{cite news|last1=Managan|first1=Jennifer|title=Think For Yourself New Nick Shows Stress Reasoning Over Memorization|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-19/features/9410190022_1_gullah-gullah-island-ron-and-natalie-daise-happy-professor|accessdate=7 June 2014|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=October 19, 1994|quote="Gullah Gullah Island."

The series revolves around a family headed by Ron and Natalie Daise, playing fictionalized versions of themselves, known as The Alstons, set on the fictional "Gullah Gullah Island".  Additional cast featured the Daise's actual children Simeon and Sara among others, including a full-body puppet [[frog]], Binyah Binyah ('Binyah' is the Gullah word for 'island native'.)&lt;ref name=Smth&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendry|first1=Erica|title=Holding on to Gullah Culture  A Smithsonian curator visits a Georgia island to find stories of a shrinking community that has clung to its African traditions|website=Smithsonian.org|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|date=March 2011|quote=Bailey drove Amos around the island in a boxy utility van, pointing out houses and fields and slipping into island dialect: binya is a native islander, comya is a visitor. r}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was taped and recorded at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in Orlando at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with the show ''[[Clarissa Explains It All]]'' shot on the same set (interior and exterior).&lt;ref name=Spoleto /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=On TV|title=Polliwog Helps Bring Gullah Culture To Life|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-07-07/entertainment/9606260243_1_natalie-daise-gullah-gullah-island-preschool-show|publisher=Sun Sentinel|accessdate=8 June 2014|date=July 7, 1996|quote=Gullah Gullah Island, the first preschool show centered on a black family, is the network's top-rated live action preschool show with an estimated 767,000 children between ages 2 and 5 watching daily.The Daises live in nearby Beaufort with their children, 6-year-old Sara and 3-year-old Simeon, who are both in the cast.

Since last fall, the network has licensed a series of children's books, videos, CDs and cassettes. The first of the Binyah Binyah Polliwog plush animals hit the stores in April.  The children in the cast are consulted about the dancing and dialogue in the show.  "We use `kiddieography' instead of choreography," said choreographer Ken Grant as he watched Vinson take another angle on the beach.  The cast, which includes three child actors in addition to the Daises' two children, tapes exteriors for about three weeks each year near Beaufort.

There will be familiar songs and stories and children will be encouraged to participate. But Ron doesn't want to say too much about the theme of the low-tech touring show.  "It's to encourage the children to use their imaginations to pretend," is all he will say. "I'd like it to be a surprise for the audience."  A big difference between the television show and the touring show is there's a lot less dialogue without the presence of the show's close-knit "family" of three children and relatives and friends. The Daises' own children, Simeon, 4, and Sara, 7, both act on the television show.  The touring show started as a 30-minute live gig at bookstores and malls. It was called "Nick Jr. Story and Song Play Along." The crowds were so large that in January, Nickelodeon launched a 1-1/2-hour show for larger venues.  Going on the road was old hat for Ron and Natalie, who, before "Gullah Gullah Island," traveled the country for a decade performing "Sea Island Montage," a two-person show featuring the songs and stories of the Gullah people.  They also have toured extensively to promote their independently produced books and records, including Ron's children's book "Little Muddy Waters: A Gullah Folk Tale" and the recently released recording "Sleep Tight: Lullabies &amp; Night-Night Stories."  Ron said that he and Natalie aren't terribly disappointed they won't be making any more "Gullah Gullah Island" shows. After all, he said, they have shot four seasons of shows already, a year more than Nickelodeon's standard three-year production for successful pre-school shows. There may be some specials. And they know the show will inspire generations of pre-schoolers to come through syndication.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Critical reception of the show was consistently positive; both as a children's show and as groundbreaker for African American programming, it was praised for "vividly colored sets, infectious sing-alongs, unique character accents and quirky humor that defined the show and introduced millions of children to an overlooked but centuries-old branch of African American culture."&lt;ref name=Purdue2&gt;{{cite news |last1=Novak |first1=Tom|title=BCC brings creators of '90s nostalgia heavy kids' show 'Gullah Gullah Island' to Fowler |url=http://www.purdueexponent.org/features/article_e67fd4f8-0501-53b0-b84b-2cfe8ced53c1.html|accessdate=8 June 2014|publisher=Purdue University |date=September 5, 2013|quote=Some may be a little too young to remember, but many students won't be able to forget the vividly colored sets, infectious sing-alongs, unique character accents and quirky humor that defined the show and introduced millions of children to an overlooked but centuries-old branch of African American culture.  The Gullah culture exists on the rice plantation islands of South Carolina and southern Georgia, where slaves from Sierra Leone were taken to work at because of their knowledge of rice farming. Because bridges were not built to these islands until the mid 20th century, their culture remained isolated and free to develop on its own. It is one of the most well-preserved African American cultures, even with its own language, a mixture of English and West African dialects – much like Creole is to French.  Just as the TV show was based upon a model of "call-and-response" taken from Gullah culture,}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described as "a combination summer camp, cheerleading session and music video."&lt;ref name=SSENT2&gt;{{cite news|title=Polliwog Helps Bring Gullah Culture To Life|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-07-07/entertainment/9606260243_1_natalie-daise-gullah-gullah-island-preschool-show|accessdate=8 June 2014|agency=Features|publisher=Sun Sentinel|date=July 7, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issues, especially with the first season, had to do with show's depiction being unrealistic. "The songs were lively and catchy, the kids were cute and the general theme was unlike other kids' programming," Jenifer Managan of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote. However:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... it stars "perfect" parents, Ron and Natalie Daise, who with their three children (who never fight), neighbors and friends seek to entertain and socially educate kids through a sing-song series. While the show encourages active participation from at-home viewers, the dictionary responses and incomparable energy from the Daises make normal parents look like misfits. Perhaps as the show seasons, the lip-syncing will improve and the characters won't be so picture-perfect.&lt;ref name=Gullahbaloo /&gt;&lt;ref name=Trib /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1996, ''[[TV Guide]]'' named the show one of "10 best children's shows".&lt;ref name=Purdue /&gt; During its original broadcast it was Nickelodeon's highest-rated preschool show, averaging more 750,000 viewers per episode.&lt;ref name=BlackEnterprise&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Carolyn|title=The Promise Of Programming|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TlwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=%22gullah+gullah+island%22+black&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SQYOE3S8xm&amp;sig=pEuS-Y-mAc0sWrhhQSyTDUnDVvA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FaaTU9XNCMOxyATkpYG4Bg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAjg8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22gullah%20gullah%20island%22%20black&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 June 2014|agency=Black Enterprise|publisher=Earl G.

==''Binyah Binyah!''==
In 1997, five episodes of a ''Gullah Gullah Island'' miniseries titled ''Binyah Binyah!'' were produced at the now-defunct [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in Orlando, Florida, and aired from February 2 to February 6, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lyonpuppets.com/binyah.html&lt;/ref&gt; A separate theme song written by [[Sean Altman]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seanaltman.com/sean97b.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; was given to these episodes. The miniseries also featured several new puppet characters in addition to the original cast, and focused on polliwog Binyah Binyah journeying to locations outside of Gullah Gullah. Ron and Natalie Daise were a part of the cast as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.courant.com/1998-02-22/news/9802210141_1_gullah-gullah-island-puerto-rico-perez-family/5&lt;/ref&gt; It was never broadcast again after its initial airing of episodes, nor was it released to home video. A promo advertising the series' debut is the only known footage; all five episodes were believed to be lost until 2017, when snippets of episode 5 and all of episode 4 surfaced online, evidently coming from a homemade VHS tape of old Nickelodeon shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yesterworld: 5 Lost, Destroyed, and Locked Away Television Episodes &amp; Broadcasts |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5e4r4qVIEo |website=YouTube |publisher=Yesterworld Entertainment |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HHole for Mannheim (2006-∞)''' is a permanent multimedia installation in the "Athene-Trakt" of the [[:de:Kunsthalle Mannheim|Kunsthalle Mannheim]]&lt;ref name="Kunsthalle Mannheim 1907-2007"&gt;{{cite book | title=100 Yahre Kunsthalle Mannheim 1907-2007 | publisher=Kunsthalle Mannheim | year=2007 | isbn=978-3-89165-210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; created by [[NatHalie Braun Barends]].

The Kunsthalle is {{asof|2015}} under reconstruction. Following a court decision of the Landgericht Mannheim, the installation will likely not be rebuilt afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/kunsthalle-muss-mannheimer-loch-nicht-wieder-installieren-13556651.html|title=Landgericht weist Klage ab: Kunsthalle muss „Mannheimer Loch“ nicht wieder installieren|trans-title=|author=|date=24 April 2015|publisher=|access-date=26 January 2017|via=FAZ.NET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Landgericht Mannheim decided that the right of the owner of the building (even if against the signed loan contracts) overrides  the copyright and the property of the artist, to allow the city to build the new €70 millions museum. It is to appreciate that the artist, in order to protect the fundamental right of artistic freedom, property right and copyright will go on to the next instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/kunst-und-architektur/article140084472/Und-ich-sage-dieses-Loch-ist-Kunst.html|title=Mannheimer Loch: Ist es nichts? Oder ist es Kunst? - WELT|trans-title=|author=|date=25 April 2015|work=Welt.de|access-date=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
HHole for Mannheim (2006-∞) has been conceived as a permanent, conceptual, site specific, developing artwork in progress.&lt;ref name="NatHalie Braun Barends - Light Art Life"&gt;{{cite book | title=NatHalie Braun Barends - Light Art Life | publisher=Art Space | year=2007 | location=Berlin/New York/Santiago | isbn=978-3-941494-00-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It consists of seven holes which pass through the Athene Trakt that unites the old (Billing-Bau) and the new building (Mitzlaff-Bau) of the Mannheim Kunsthalle.

The natural light flows from the topmost hole above the museum rooftop, through the holes in the floors below, meeting the light projected upwards from a Gobo projector located at the lowest floor. At the rooftop, a custom designed laser light (also used by astronomers to point at stars), projects into the universe the artist's symbol of the HMap. The natural and the artificial lights meet again symbolically at the antipodes of the museum, close to New Zealand at 49° 28′ 56.68″ S, 171° 31′ 29.63″ E.

Seven rooms contain the seven holes, starting from above: Infinite Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/7-infinite/infinite.php-page=text.htm|title=Infinite Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenix Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hn2b.net/HHole/6-phoenix/phoenix.php-page=text.htm|title=Phoenix Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflection Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/5-reflection/reflection.php-page=text.htm|title=Reflection Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silence Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/4-silence/silence.php-page=text.htm|title=Silence Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treasure Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/3-treasure/treasure.php-page=text.htm|title=Treasure Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ground Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/2-ground/ground.php-page=text.htm|title=Ground Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Earth Room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/1-earth/earth.php-page=text.htm|title=Earth Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each room hosts different installations, with videos, HHole specially designed acrylic furniture, waterfall, living tree, pool, and telephone to connect each level.

'''''Imitation of Life''''' is a 1959 American [[romantic drama]] film directed by [[Douglas Sirk]], produced by [[Ross Hunter]] and released by [[Universal Pictures|Universal International]]. It was Sirk's final Hollywood film and dealt with issues of race, class and gender. ''Imitation of Life'' is the second film adaptation of [[Fannie Hurst]]'s [[Imitation of Life (novel)|novel of the same name]]; [[Imitation of Life (1934 film)|the first]], directed by [[John M. Stahl]], was released in 1934.

The film's top-billed stars are [[Lana Turner]] and [[John Gavin]], and the cast also features [[Sandra Dee]], [[Dan O'Herlihy]], [[Susan Kohner]], [[Robert Alda]] and [[Juanita Moore]]. Kohner and Moore received [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for their performances. [[Gospel music]] star [[Mahalia Jackson]] appears as a church choir soloist.

In 2015, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected ''Imitation of Life'' for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" just like the original 1934 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ghostbusters-top-gun-enter-national-849092|title='Ghostbusters,' 'Top Gun,' 'Shawshank' Enter National Film Registry|author=Mike Barnes|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 16, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Lana Turner in Imitation of Life 2.jpg|thumb|left|165px|[[Lana Turner]]]]
In 1947, widow Lora Meredith ([[Lana Turner]]) dreams of becoming a famous [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[actress]]. Losing track of her young daughter Susie at the beach (portrayed as a child by [[Terry Burnham]]), she asks a stranger named Steve Archer ([[John Gavin]]) to help her find the girl. Susie is found and looked after by Annie Johnson ([[Juanita Moore]]), a black single mother who also has a daughter, Sarah Jane (portrayed as a child by Karin Dicker), who is about Susie's age. Sarah Jane inherited her father's fair skin and can [[Passing (racial identity)|pass]] for white. She does this with fierce zeal and fervor, taking advantage of her European heritage and features. In return for Annie's kindness, Lora temporarily takes in Annie and her daughter. Annie persuades Lora to let her stay and look after the household, so that the widow can pursue an acting career.

With struggles along the way, Lora becomes a star of stage comedies, with Allen Loomis ([[Robert Alda]]) as her agent and David Edwards ([[Dan O'Herlihy]]) as her chief playwright. Although Lora had begun a relationship with Steve Archer, the stranger she met at the beach, their courtship falls apart because he does not want her to be a star. Lora's concentration  on her career prevents her from spending time with her daughter, who sees more of Annie. Annie and Sarah Jane have their own problems, as Sarah Jane is struggling with her mixed-race identity and wants to pass for white because of its privileges in American society in the pre-civil rights era.

Eleven years later, in 1958, Lora is a highly regarded Broadway star living in a luxurious home in New York. Annie continues to live with her, serving as nanny, housekeeper, confidante and best friend. After rejecting David's latest script (and his marriage proposal), Lora takes a role in a dramatic play. At the show's after-party, she meets Steve, whom she has not seen in a decade. The two slowly begin rekindling their relationship, and Steve is reintroduced to Annie and the now-teenaged Susie ([[Sandra Dee]]) and Sarah Jane ([[Susan Kohner]]). When Lora is signed to star in an [[Italy|Italian]] motion picture, she leaves Steve to watch after Susie. The teenager develops an unrequited crush on her mother's boyfriend.
[[File:Imitation of Life-Juanita Moore.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Juanita Moore]] (right)]]
Sarah Jane continues to pass as white and begins dating a white boy ([[Troy Donahue]]). He beats her in an alleyway after learning she is black. Some time later, she again passes for white to get a job performing at a seedy nightclub, but tells her mother she is working at the library. When Annie learns the truth, she goes to the club to claim her daughter; Sarah Jane is fired. Her rejection of her mother begins taking a physical and mental toll on Annie. When Lora returns from Italy, Sarah Jane has run away from home. She asks Steve to hire a detective to find her. The detective locates Sarah Jane in California, living as a white woman under an assumed name and working as a chorus girl. Annie, becoming weaker and more depressed by the day, flies out to California to see her daughter one last time and say goodbye.

Annie is bedridden upon her return to New York, and Lora and Susie look after her. The issue of Susie's crush on Steve becomes serious when Susie learns that Steve and Lora are to be married. Annie tells Lora of the girl's crush. After a confrontation with her mother, Susie decides to go away to school in [[Denver, Colorado]], to forget about Steve. Not long after Susie leaves, Annie passes away. As she wished, Annie is given a lavish funeral in a large church, complete with a gospel choir, followed by an elaborate traditional funeral procession with brass band and horse-drawn hearse. Just before the procession sets off, Sarah Jane pushes through the crowd of mourners to throw herself upon her mother's casket, begging forgiveness. Lora takes Sarah Jane to their limousine to join her, Susie, and Steve as the procession slowly travels through the city.

==History and production==
The plot of the 1959 version of ''Imitation of Life'' was significantly altered from the original book and the 1934 film version. In the original story, the "Lora" character, Bea Pullman, became successful by commercial production of her maid Delilah's family waffle recipe (the 1934 film version features a family pancake recipe instead of a waffle recipe). As a result, Bea, the white businesswoman, becomes rich. Delilah is offered 20% of the profits, but declines and chooses to remain Bea's dutiful assistant.

Director Douglas Sirk and screenwriters Eleanore Griffin and [[Allan Scott (American screenwriter)|Allan Scott]] felt that such a story would not be accepted during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] amid milestones, such as the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' case and the [[Montgomery bus boycott]], but racial discrimination and inequities was still part of it. The story was altered so that Lora becomes a Broadway star with her own talents, with Annie assisting her by serving as a nanny for Lora's child. Producer [[Ross Hunter]] was cannily aware that these plot changes would enable [[Lana Turner]] to model an array of glamorous costumes and real jewels, something that would appeal to the female audience at that time. Lana Turner's wardrobe for ''Imitation of Life'' cost over $1.078 million, making it one of the most expensive in cinema history at that time.&lt;ref name="Handzo"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Handzo |first=Steven |date=1977 |title=Intimations of Lifelessness |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/18/18_lana.html |journal=[[Bright Lights Film Journal]] |issue=6 |accessdate=2013-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many actresses, most of them white,&lt;ref name="SKohner2015" /&gt; were screen-tested for the Sarah Jane role in the 1959 remake, [[Susan Kohner]], daughter of actress [[Lupita Tovar]], born in Mexico, and [[Paul Kohner]], a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[Jewish]] immigrant, won the role.&lt;ref name="SKohner2015"&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://filmforum.org/film/imitation-of-life-film-page |title=Imitation of Life |website= [[Film Forum]]  |host=Foster Hirsch |date=April 9, 2015 |time= |accessdate=2015-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Karin Dicker made her debut in this film as the young Sarah Jane. Noted gospel singer [[Mahalia Jackson]] received "presenting" billing for her one scene, performing a version of "Trouble of the World" at Annie's funeral service.

==Release and critical reaction==
Sirk's ''Imitation of Life'' premiered in [[Chicago]] on March 17, 1959, followed by [[Los Angeles]] on March 20 and [[New York City]] on April 17,&lt;ref name="AFI" /&gt; then Universal put the film into general release on April 30. Though it was not well-reviewed upon its original release and was viewed as inferior to the original 1934 film version&amp;nbsp;– many critics derided the film as a "soap opera,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gallagher |first=Tag |date=July 2005 |title=White Melodrama: Douglas Sirk |work=Senses of Cinema |url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2005/feature-articles/sirk-2/ |accessdate=2013-03-09 |quote=The critics had barfed all over the film, hating it as "a soap opera" for the same reasons Sirk and we loved it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– ''Imitation of Life'' was the fourth-most successful motion picture of 1959, grossing $6.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;"Database: 1959".

Both Moore and Kohner were nominated for the 1959 [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] and the 1959 [[17th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe award]] for Best Supporting Actress. While neither actress won the Oscar, Kohner won the Golden Globe for her performance. Moore won second place in the category of Top Female Supporting Performance at the 1959 [[Laurel Awards]], and the film won Top Drama. Douglas Sirk was nominated for the 1959 [[Directors Guild of America Awards|Directors Guild of America Award]].&lt;ref&gt;Awards and nominations for ''Imitation of Life''. ''Internet Movie Database''. Retrieved from https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052918/awards on January 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 20th century, ''Imitation of Life'' has been re-evaluated by critics. It has been considered a masterpiece of Sirk's American career. [[Emanuel Levy]] has written, "One of the four masterpieces directed in the 1950s, the visually lush, meticulously designed and powerfully acted ''Imitation of Life'' was the jewel in Sirk's crown, ending his Hollywood's career before he returned to his native Germany."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Levy |first=Emanuel |title=Imitation of Life (1959) |date=August 15, 2009 |url=http://www.emanuellevy.com/review/imitation-of-life-1959-6/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sirk provided the Annie–Sarah Jane relationship in his version with more screen time and more intensity than the original versions of the story. Critics later commented that Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner stole the film from Turner.&lt;ref name = "Handzo"/&gt; Sirk later said that he had deliberately and subversively undercut Turner to draw focus toward the problems of the two black characters.

Sirk's treatment of racial and class issues is also admired for what he caught of the times. Writing in 1997, Rob Nelson said, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Basically, we're left to intuit that the black characters (and the movie) are themselves products of '50s-era racism&amp;nbsp;– which explains the film's perspective, but hardly makes it less dizzying. Possibly thinking of [[W. E. B. Du Bois|W.E.B. Du Bois]]'s notion of African American double-consciousness, critic [[Molly Haskell]] once described ''Imitation's'' double-vision: "The mixed-race girl's agonizing quest for her identity is not seen from her point of view as much as it is mockingly reflected in the fun house mirrors of the culture from which she is hopelessly alienated."&lt;ref name="passing"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.citypages.com/1997-06-11/movies/passing-time/ |first=Rob |last=Nelson |title=Passing Time/ Through a Glass, Darkly: Juanita Moore and Lana Turner in Douglas Sirk's 'Imitation of Life |work=Minneapolis City Pages |date=June 11, 1997 |accessdate=2015-04-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408123627/http://www.citypages.com/1997-06-11/movies/passing-time/ |archive-date=2015-04-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Imitation of Life'' became a staple of both the [[American Movie Classics]] and [[Turner Classic Movies]] [[cable television]] networks. [[Todd Haynes]]' ''[[Far from Heaven]]'' (2002) is an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to Sirk's work, in particular ''[[All That Heaven Allows]]'' (1955) and ''Imitation of Life''. The 1969 [[Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes]] song "[[I'm Livin' in Shame]]" and the 2001 [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]] song, "[[Imitation of Life (song)|Imitation of Life]]," are based upon this film.

In 2015, [[BBC Online]], the website of the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]], named the film the 37th greatest American movie ever made based on a survey of film critics.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news |title=The 100 Greatest American Films |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150720-the-100-greatest-american-films |work=[[BBC Online|bbc.com]] |date=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indeterminacy''' in literature is a situation in which components of a text require the reader to make their own decisions about the text’s meaning. (Baldick 2008) This can occur if the text’s ending does not provide full closure and there are still questions to be answered, or when "the language is such that the author’s original intention is not known". Baldick further describes the concept as "a principle of uncertainty invoked to deny the existence of any final or determinate meaning that could bring to an end the play of meaning between the elements of a text". Therefore, indeterminacy is the belief that it is not possible to decide entirely what a word means when used in a certain circumstance, so the meaning of the whole text must remain open to interpretation.

==Indeterminacy is not ambiguity==
In literature, indeterminacy is sometimes confused with the idea of ambiguity, as the two are very alike. However, as opposed to ambiguity, indeterminacy is "applied by its practitioners not only to literature but also to the interpretation of texts". (Encyclopædia Britannica 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;1 of 1) Nevertheless, the presence of indeterminacy does not mean that decisions about meaning cannot be made at all, but only that there will be no final official judgement or approval on any individual interpretation. (Baldick 2008) Furthermore, the presence of indeterminacy does not result in all interpretations being of equal legitimacy; instead it indicates that all meanings drawn from an indeterminate text are "partial and provisional, and that what we write about it itself as a text, is open to further interpretation".

==Indeterminacy and the reader's imagination==
A slightly different approach to indeterminacy is the idea that the reader’s "concretization is left to a large extent to... imagination". (Stanzel 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;116) This becomes clear when comparing narrative fiction; which is commonly indeterminate, to film; the very nature of which often precludes indeterminacy. Stanzel quotes [[John Fowles]] in regards to the indeterminacy of narrative as an advantage. "There are hundreds of things a novel can do that a cinema can never do. The cinema can’t digress, above all it can’t exclude... you’ve got to have a certain chair, certain clothes, certain decor.  In a novel... you don’t have to “set up” the whole screen. The delight of writing novels is what you can leave out on each page, in each sentence".&lt;!-- I'm assuming this is the quote, as it sounds colloquial --&gt;

Furthermore, McHale (1992, p.&amp;nbsp;36) highlights the "partial indeterminacy, the 'gappiness' of fictional objects, including fictional characters", by pointing out that no depiction of a fictional character or object could ever be as absolute as what actual human beings consider themselves and their objects to be. "It is always as if a beam of light were illuminating a part of a region, the remainder of which disappears in an indeterminate cloud". (McHale 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;36)

==Deconstruction theory==
This literary meaning of indeterminacy is often associated with [[deconstruction]], the [[post-structuralist]] theory propounded by [[Jacques Derrida]], and is best described as "a philosophically sceptical approach to the possibility of coherent meaning in language". (Baldick 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;1 of 1) However, Royle (1995, p.&amp;nbsp;46) quotes Derrida as saying "I do not believe I have ever spoken of 'indeterminacy', whether in regard to 'meaning' or anything else... deconstruction should never lead either to [[relativism]] or to any sort of indeterminism".

==Indeterminacy theory==
According to indeterminacy theory, all texts can have the "multiplicity of possible interpretations of given textual elements, because the author’s meaning or intent may be unclear, or distorted by pop culture".{{cite quote|date=April 2016}}  So, indeterminacy is not always purposeful. However, while some indeterminacy in literary fiction is permanent; the gap will never be filled or closed; other areas of indeterminacy are temporary, and deliberately planted by the author with the intention of leaving a gap that the reader themself can fill, by the "process of realizing or concretising the text". (McHale 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;36)

'''''La haine''''' ({{IPA-fr|la ʔɛn}}, ''Hate'') is a 1995 French [[black-and-white]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written, co-edited, and directed by [[Mathieu Kassovitz]]. It is commonly released under its French title in the [[English-speaking world]], although its U.S. VHS release was titled '''''Hate'''''. It is about three young friends and their struggle to live in the ''[[banlieue]]s'' of Paris. The title derives from a line spoken by one of them, Hubert, ''"La haine attire la haine!"'', "hatred breeds hatred."

==Plot==
The film depicts approximately 20 consecutive hours in the lives of three friends in their early twenties from immigrant families living in an impoverished multi-ethnic French [[housing project]] (a ZUP{{snd}}''{{lang|fr|zone d'urbanisation prioritaire}}'') in the suburbs of Paris, in the aftermath of a riot. [[Jew]]ish Vinz ([[Vincent Cassel]]) is filled with rage. He sees himself as a gangster ready to win respect by killing a police officer, manically practising the role of Travis Bickle from the film ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' in the mirror secretly. His attitude towards police is a simplified, stylized blanket condemnation, also to individual police officers who make an effort to steer the trio clear of troublesome situations. Hubert ([[Hubert Koundé]]) is an [[Afro-French]] boxer and small-time drug dealer, the most mature of the three, whose gymnasium was burned in the riots. The quietest, most thoughtful and wisest of the three, he sadly contemplates the ghetto and the hate around him. He expresses the wish to leave his world of violence and hate behind, but does not know how since he lacks the means to do so. Saïd{{snd}}Sayid in some English subtitles{{snd}}([[Saïd Taghmaoui]]) is an [[Arab]] [[Maghrebis|Maghrebi]] who inhabits the middle ground between his two friends' responses to their place in life.

A friend of theirs, Abdel Ichaha, has been brutalized by the police shortly before the riot and lies in a coma. Vinz finds a police officer's [[.44 Magnum]] revolver, lost in the riot. He vows that if their friend dies from his injuries, he will use it to kill a cop, and when he hears of Abdel's death he fantasizes carrying out his vengeance.

The three go through an aimless daily routine and struggle to entertain themselves, frequently finding themselves under police scrutiny. After Vinz nearly shoots a riot police officer and the group narrowly escapes, they take a train to Paris but encounter many of the same frustrations, and their responses to interactions with both benign and malicious Parisians cause several situations to degenerate to dangerous hostility. A run-in with sadistic [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] police, during which Saïd and Hubert are humiliated and racially as well as physically abused, results in their missing the last train home and spending the night on the streets. They sleep in a shopping mall and wake to a news broadcast informing them that Abdel is dead. They travel to a roof-top from which they insult skinheads and policemen, before encountering the same group of racist anti-immigrant skinheads who begin to beat Saïd and Hubert savagely, now that the balance of power has shifted. Vinz arrives, and his gun allows him to break up the fight; all the skinheads flee except one (portrayed by Kassovitz himself) whom Vinz is about to execute in cold blood. His dream of revenge is thwarted by his reluctance to go through with the deed, and, cleverly goaded by Hubert, he is forced to confront the fact that his true nature is not the heartless gangster he poses as, and he lets the skinhead flee.

Early in the morning, the trio returns to the [[banlieue]] and split up to their separate homes, and Vinz turns the gun over to Hubert. However, Vinz and Saïd encounter a plainclothes police officer, whom Vinz had insulted earlier in the day whilst with his friends on a local rooftop. He grabs and threatens Vinz, making reference to the earlier incident on the roof. Hubert rushes to their aid, but as the police officer holding Vinz taunts him with a loaded gun held to Vinz's head, the gun accidentally goes off, killing Vinz instantly. Hubert and the police officer slowly and deliberately point their guns at each other, and as the film cuts to Saïd closing his eyes and cuts to black, a shot is heard on the soundtrack, with no indication of who fired or who may have been hit. This stand-off is underlined by a voice-over of Hubert's slightly modified opening lines ("It's about a society in free fall..."), underlining the fact that, as the lines say, ''jusqu'ici tout va bien'' ("so far so good"); all seems to be going relatively well until Vinz is killed, and from there no one knows what will happen, a microcosm of French society's descent through hostility into pointless violence.

==Production==
Kassovitz has said that the idea came to him when a young [[Zaire|Zairian]], Makome M’Bowole, was shot in 1993. He was killed at point blank range while in police custody and handcuffed to a radiator. The officer was reported to have been angered by Makome's words, and had been threatening him when the gun went off accidentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Kevin|last=Elstob|title=Hate (La Haine) review|journal=[[Film Quarterly]]|volume=51|issue=2 (Winter, 1997-1998)|pages=44–49|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Berkeley, California|issn=0015-1386|jstor=3697140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kassovitz began writing the script on April 6, 1993, the day M'Bowole was shot. He was also inspired by the case of [[Malik Oussekine]], a 22-year-old student protester who died after being badly beaten by the riot police after a mass demonstration in 1986, in which he did not take part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/30/international/europe/30smashers.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|first=Elaine|last=Sciolino|title=Violent Youths Threaten to Hijack Demonstrations in Paris|date=30 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oussekine's death is also referred to in the opening montage of the film.&lt;ref name="criterion.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/642-la-haine-and-after-arts-politics-and-the-banlieue|title=La haine and after: Arts, Politics, and the Banlieue|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathieu Kassovitz included his own experiences; he took part in riots, he acts in a number of scenes and includes his father [[Peter Kassovitz|Peter]] in another.

The majority of the filming was done in the Parisian suburb of [[Chanteloup-les-Vignes]]. Unstaged footage was used for this film, taken from 1986–96; riots still took place during the time of filming. To actually film in the projects, Kassovitz, the production team and the actors, moved there for three months prior to the shooting as well as during actual filming.&lt;ref name="dvdbeaver1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/dvdreviews5/hate.htm|title=la HAINE|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the film's controversial subject matter, seven or eight local French councils refused to allow the film crew to film on their territory. Kassovitz was forced to temporarily rename the script Droit de Cité.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/why-the-prime-minister-had-to-see-la-haine-1578297.html| location=London| work=The Independent| first=Sheila| last=Johnston| title=Why the prime minister had to see La Haine| date=October 19, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the actors were not professionals. The film has a documentary feel and includes many situations that were based on real events.&lt;ref name="dvdbeaver1"/&gt;

The music of the film was handled by French hardcore rap group [[Assassin (rap crew)|Assassin]], whose song "Nique La Police" (translated as "Fuck The Police") was featured in one of the scenes of the film. One of the members of Assassin, [[Rockin' Squat|Mathias "Rockin' Squat" Crochon]], is the brother of Vincent Cassel, who plays Vinz in the film.&lt;ref name="criterion.com"/&gt;

The film is dedicated to those who died while it was being made.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Reception==
Upon its release, ''La haine'' received widespread critical acclaim and was well received in France and abroad. The film was shown at the [[1995 Cannes Film Festival]] where it enjoyed a standing ovation. Kassovitz was awarded the Best Director prize at the festival.&lt;ref name="criterion.com"/&gt; The film had a total of 2,042,070 admissions in France where it was the 14th highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref name="JPBox Office" /&gt; Based on 25 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an overall approval rating from critics of 100%, with an average score of 8/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Haine (1996)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la_haine/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Thomas of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film "raw, vital and captivating".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Compelling, Bleak Look at 'Hate'|first=Kevin|last=Thomas|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-08/entertainment/ca-44396_1_mathieu-kassovitz|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=8 March 1996|accessdate=7 July 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zzKlcUKj?url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-08/entertainment/ca-44396_1_mathieu-kassovitz|archivedate=7 July 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wendy Ide of ''[[The Times]]'' stated that ''La haine'' is "One of the most blisteringly effective pieces of urban cinema ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La Haine|first=Wendy|last=Ide|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article471243.ece|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=19 August 2004|accessdate=7 July 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zzKyBCst?url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article471243.ece|archivedate=7 July 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the film was well received upon its release in France, [[Alain Juppé]], who was Prime Minister of France at the time, commissioned a special screening of the film for the cabinet, which ministers were required to attend. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said that, despite resenting some of the anti-police themes present in the film, Juppé found ''La haine'' to be "a beautiful work of cinematographic art that can make us more aware of certain realities."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

It was ranked #32 in ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's "The 100 Best Films of World Cinema" in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema &amp;#124; 32.

'''Mary Elizabeth Connell''' (26 March 1917, [[York]] - July 1997) was an English-born South African botanical illustrator.&lt;ref&gt;https://abcjournal.org/index.php/ABC/article/download/646/591&lt;/ref&gt;

Even at an early age Connell showed exceptional artistic talent and her first schooling was at the York College for Girls (closed down in 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Establishments/Establishment/Details/121723?searchQueryString=searchtype=ByLocalAuthority&amp;d=84&amp;startIndex=150&amp;Count=162|title=York College for Girls - GOV.UK|website=www.get-information-schools.service.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; She submitted her work to the [[Royal College of Art]] for their Masters examinations and was awarded honours in 1932 for Drawing from Nature Forms and 1933 for Pictorial Representation.

In 1933 her family moved to South Africa. She completed her schooling at [[Barnato Park High School]] in Berea, and enrolled at the Johannesburg School of Art. However, in 1936 a botanical artist post at the National Herbarium in Pretoria became available and her appointment was approved.

Her first project was to produce large plates illustrating poisonous and noxious plants for publication in the periodical 'Farming in South Africa', and later published as Henderson and Anderson's 'Common Weeds in South Africa' (Botanical Survey Memoir No. 37 of 1966). She was taken under the wing of [[Cythna Letty]], grand dame of South African botanical artists, and began to produce plates for the botanical journal '[[Flowering Plants of Africa]]'. In all, she created 121 plates for that work.

In addition she contributed artwork for White, Dyer &amp; Sloane’s 'The Succulent Euphorbieae' (1941), Meredith’s 'The Grasses and Pastures of South Africa' (1955) and 'Flora of Southern
Africa'. After producing and raising a family she returned to the National Herbarium between 1958 and 1960, and created 83 of the line drawings of weeds for 'Common Weeds in South Africa' (1966), a new version of [[Edwin Percy Phillips|Phillips’]] 'Weeds of South Africa' (1939), a publication to which she had also contributed.

'''''Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature''''' ({{lang-de|Mimesis: Dargestellte Wirklichkeit in der abendländischen Literatur}}) is a book of [[literary criticism]] by [[Erich Auerbach]], and his most well known work. Written while Auerbach was teaching in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], where he fled after being ousted from his professorship in Romance [[Philology]] at the [[University of Marburg]] by the [[Nazis]] in 1935,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

''Mimesis'' famously opens with a comparison between the way the world is represented in [[Homer]]’s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the way it appears in the [[Bible]]. From these two seminal [[Western culture|Western]] texts, Auerbach builds the foundation for a unified theory of [[representation (arts)|representation]] that spans the entire history of Western literature, including even the [[Modernist]] novelists writing at the time Auerbach began his study.

==Overview==
''Mimesis'' gives an account of the way in which [[everyday life]] in its seriousness has been represented by many Western writers, from ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writers such as [[Petronius]] and [[Tacitus]], early [[Christian]] writers such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Medieval]] writers such as [[Chretien de Troyes]], [[Dante]], and  [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], [[Renaissance]] writers such as [[Montaigne]], [[Rabelais]], [[Shakespeare]] and [[Cervantes]], seventeenth-century writers such as [[Molière]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writers such as [[Voltaire]], nineteenth-century writers such as [[Stendhal]], [[Balzac]], [[Flaubert]], and [[Émile Zola|Zola]], all the way up to twentieth-century writers such as [[Proust]], and [[Virginia Woolf|Woolf]]. Despite his treatment of the many major works, Auerbach apparently did not think he was comprehensive enough, and apologized in the original publication in 1946 explaining that he had access only to the 'insufficient' resources available in the library at [[Istanbul University]] where he worked;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The mode of literary criticism in which ''Mimesis'' operates is often referred to among contemporary critics as [[historicism]], since Auerbach largely regarded the way reality was represented in the literature of various periods to be intimately bound up with social and intellectual conventions of the time in which they were written. Auerbach considered himself a historical [[Perspectivism|perspectivist]] in the German tradition (he mentioned [[Hegel]] in this respect) exploring specific features of [[literary genre|style]], [[grammar]], [[syntax]], and [[diction]] claims about much broader cultural and historical questions. Of ''Mimesis'', Auerbach wrote that his "purpose is always to write history."

He is in the same German tradition of [[philology]] as [[Ernst Robert Curtius|Ernst Curtius]], [[Leo Spitzer]], and [[Karl Vossler]], having a mastery of many languages and epochs and all-inclusive in its approach, incorporating just about any intellectual endeavor into the discipline of literary criticism.

Auerbach was a [[Romance language]] specialist, which explains his admitted bias towards treating texts from French compared to other languages. [[Chaucer]] and [[Wordsworth]] are not mentioned even in passing, though [[Shakespeare]] and [[Virginia Woolf]] are given full chapters and [[Dickens]] and [[Henry Fielding]] make appearances.

==Position and evaluation of rhetoric==
To the consternation of his colleague, Ernst Curtius, Auerbach's work is marked by an openly anti-rhetorical position. Classical writers such as [[Homer]], [[Tacitus]] and [[Petronius]], as well as Medieval theologians (except St. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]), and writers of the seventeenth century, like [[Jean Racine|Racine]], are criticized for adherence to the rhetorical doctrine of "styles" with their corresponding subject matters: the low style's association with the comedic and the popular classes, and the elevated style's association with the tragic, the historic and the heroic. Auerbach sees the Bible as opposing this rhetorical doctrine in its serious and poignant portrayals of common folk and their encounter with the divine. As Auerbach notes in chapter two when discussing the New Testament:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But the spirit of rhetoric&amp;mdash;a spirit which classified subjects in ''genera'' and invested every subject with a specific form of style as one garment becoming it in virtue of its nature [i.e. lower classes with the farcical low-style, upper classes with the tragic, the historic and the sublime elevated-style]&amp;mdash;could not extend its dominion to them [the Bible writers] for the simple reason that their subject would not fit into any of the known genres. A scene like Peter's denial fits into no antique genre. It is too serious for comedy, too contemporary and everyday for tragedy, politically too insignificant for history&amp;mdash;and the form which was given it is one of such immediacy that its like does not exist in the literature of antiquity.&lt;ref name="mimesis"&gt;{{cite book

The Bible will ultimately be responsible for the "[[mixed style]]" of Christian rhetoric, a style that is described by Auerbach in chapter seven as the "antithetical fusion" or "merging" of the high and low style.  The model is Christ's [[Incarnation]] as both ''sublimitas'' and ''humilitas''.  This mixture ultimately leads to a "popular realism" seen in the religious plays and sermons of the 12th Century.  Auerbach also discusses the development of an intermediate or middle style due to Medieval influences from the Bible and [[Courtly Love]] (see chapters nine and fifteen on [[Boccaccio]] and [[Molière]]). This development of an intermediate and then ultimately another "mixed style" (Shakespeare, Hugo) leads to what Auerbach calls the "modern realism" of the nineteenth-century (see chapter nineteen on [[Flaubert]]).      
  
Auerbach champions writers during periods under the sway of rhetorical forms of writing like [[Gregory of Tours]] and St. [[Francis of Assisi]], whose Latin was poor and whose rhetorical education was minimal, but who were still able to convey vivid expression and feeling. He also champions the diarist [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] who wrote about the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century French court. Completely free of the absolute constraints of style found in Racine or the superficial use of reality found in [[Antoine François Prévost|Prévost]] or [[Voltaire]], Saint-Simon's portraits of court life are considered by Auerbach, somewhat surprisingly, to be the precursor of [[Proust]] (an admirer of Saint-Simon) and [[Émile Zola|Zola]].

==Critical reception==
''Mimesis'' is almost universally respected for its penetrating insights on the particular works it addresses but is frequently criticized for what is sometimes regarded as its lack of a single overarching claim. For this reason, individual chapters of the book are often read independently. Most critics praise his sprawling approach for its reveling in the complexities of each work and [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] without resorting to generalities and [[reductionism]]. 

By far the most frequently reprinted chapter is chapter one, "[[Odysseus' scar (Auerbach)|Odysseus' Scar]]" in which Auerbach compares the scene in book 19 of [[Homer]]’s ''[[Odyssey]]'', when [[Odysseus]] finally returns home from his two decades of warring and journeying, to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 22, the story of [[Binding of Isaac|The Binding of Isaac]]. Highlighting the rhetorically determined simplicity of characters in the ''Odyssey'' (what he calls the "external") against what he regards as the psychological depth of the figures in the [[Old Testament]], Auerbach suggests that the Old Testament gives a more powerful and historical impression than the ''Odyssey'', which he classifies as closer to "legend" in which all details are leisurely fleshed out and all actions occur in a simple present – indeed even flashbacks are narrated in the present tense.

Auerbach summarizes his comparison of the texts as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The two styles, in their opposition, represent basic types: on the one hand [''The Odyssey'' 's] fully externalized description, uniform illustration, uninterrupted connection, free expression, all events in the foreground, displaying unmistakable meanings, few elements of historical development and of psychological perspective; on the other hand [in the Old Testament], certain parts brought into high relief, others left obscure, abruptness, suggestive influence of the unexpressed, "background" quality, multiplicity of meanings and the need for interpretation, universal-historical claims, development of the concept of the historically becoming, and preoccupation with the problematic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Auerbach concludes by arguing that the "full development" of these two styles, the rhetorical tradition with its constraints on representing reality and the Biblical or "realist" tradition with its engagement of everyday experience, exercised a "determining influence upon the representation of reality in European literature."

It is in the context of this comparison between the Biblical and the Homeric that Auerbach draws his famous conclusion that the Bible’s claim to truth is "tyrannical," since &lt;blockquote&gt;  
What he [the writer of the Old Testament] produced then, was not primarily oriented towards "realism" (if he succeeded in being realistic, it was merely a means, not an end): it was oriented to truth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, by the time Auerbach treats the work of [[Flaubert]] we have come full circle. Like the Biblical writers whose faith in the so-called "tyrannical" truth of God produces an authentic expression of reality, Flaubert's "faith in the truth of language" (ch. 18) likewise represents "an entire human experience."

'''''Nautilus''''' is a black-and-white photograph taken by [[Edward Weston]] in 1927 of a single [[nautilus]] shell standing on its end against a dark background. It has been called "one of the most famous photographs ever made" and "a benchmark of modernism in the history of photography."&lt;ref name=Sotheby&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?sale_number=N08624&amp;live_lot_id=122 |title=Sotheby's: Edward Weston - Nautilus|accessdate=2011-01-05}}{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
In February, 1927, Weston visited the studio of local [[Carmel-by-the-Sea|Carmel]] artist [[Henrietta Shore]] and noticed several paintings she had made of sea shells. Only one of these paintings is known to still exist (as of January, 2011), and it shows a stark and solitary nautilus on a dark field, not unlike Weston's resulting photographs.&lt;ref name=Aiken&gt;{{cite journal|first =Roger |last=Aikin  |date=Winter 1992 | title =Henrietta Shore and Edward Weston| journal =American Art | volume =6 | issue =1  | pages =42–61 | doi=10.1086/424140}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made it clear in his writings that the paintings had a profound effect on him:

{{quote|I was awakened to shells by the painting of Henry [Henrietta Shore]. I never saw a Chambered Nautilus before. If I had, my response would have been immediate. If I merely copy Henry's expression, my work will not live. If I am stimulated and work with real ecstasy it will live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward |last=Weston|editor=Nancy Newhall |title= The Daybooks of Edward Weston, Volume II|publisher=NY: Horizon Press |year=1961| pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Photographing==
Within a month he began photographing several different large chambered nautiluses, either whole or cut in half to reveal their inner structure.  He used his Ansco 8 × 10 Commercial view camera with a Rapid Rectilinear lens stopped down to US256 (equivalent to f/64) . Notations he made about his exposures during this period indicate that the film he used would be rated approximately equivalent to 16 on today's [[Film speed|ISO scale]].&lt;ref name=Newhall&gt;{{cite book| first=Beaumont |last=Newhall|title=" Edward Weston's Technique", in Edward Weston Omibus|publisher=Layton, UT: Gibbs Smith|year=1984|ISBN=0-87905-131-0|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the technical limitations of the film and the camera he used, he was forced to make extremely long exposures that were easily ruined by vibrations. Weston's grandson [[Kim Weston]] said his grandfather propped up the shell on the end of an oil drum (the arc of the drum can barely be seen in the background of the image),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.beautiful-landscape.com/Thoughts24.html |title=Notes on Photographing a - Nautilus|accessdate=2011-01-05|first=Brian |last=Pawlowski}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the thin metal oil drum head was sensitive to the slightest movement. Weston expressed his frustrations in his 'Daybooks'':

:Wednesday, June 15: "Yesterday I tried again: result, movement! The exposure was 4{{fraction|1|2}} hours, so to repeat was no joy, with all the preoccupation of keeping quiet children and cat, ‒ but I went ahead and await development."

:The next day: "The shells again moved! It must be the heavy trucks that pass jar the building ever so slightly. Anyway, I have quit trying: I can afford no more film." &lt;ref&gt;Daybooks, II, p28&lt;/ref&gt;

He recorded that over the next several months he made fourteen negatives of shells. It's not known exactly when he took this particular image, but it had to have been made between April 1 and June 8, 1927, when he recorded in his journal "Last evening I had printed, and am ready to show all shell negatives…".&lt;ref&gt;Daybooks, II, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==

''Nautilus'' is now recognized as one of Weston's greatest photographs, but all of his images of shells have a greater-than-life quality to them. Weston biographer Ben Maddow has said that what is so remarkable about them "is not in the closeness nor in the monumentality of the forms; or at least, not in these alone. It is instead in the particular light, almost an inward luminescence, that he saw implicit in them before he put them before the lens. Glowing with an interior life . .. one is seeing more than form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Den |last=Maddow |title= Edward Weston: Fifty Years|publisher=NY: Aperture|year=1973| page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One historian wrote "The nautilus shells proved a turning point in Weston’s career and marked a critical phase in his development as one of the greatest photographers of the 20th century, a pioneering modernist whose stunning simplicity and technical mastery are often imitated but never quite equaled." &lt;ref name=Sotheby2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photoinduced.com/144/edward-weston-exhibit/ |title=Debunking the Myth of Edward Weston |first=Deborah |last=Hornblow |accessdate=2011-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113135932/http://www.photoinduced.com/144/edward-weston-exhibit/ |archivedate=2011-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;"

Much has been said about Weston's intentions in photographing shells.  He recorded that some of the first people to see them had intensely erotic reactions:

:[[Tina Modotti]]: Edward ‒ nothing in art has affected like these photographs. I cannot look at them very long without feeling exceedingly perturbed, they disturb me not only mentally but physically. There is something so pure and at the same time so perverse about them…, They are mystical and erotic."&lt;ref name="DB II 31"&gt;Daybooks, II, p31&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Diego Rivera]] (as described by Tina Modotti): "These photographs are biological, beside the aesthetic emotion they disturb me physically, ‒ see my forehead is sweating. Then ‒ 'Is W. very sensual?'"&lt;ref name="DB II 31"/&gt;

:[[Rene d'Harnoncourt]] (as described by Tina Modotti): "Without my saying a word he used 'erotic' also. Like me, he expressed the disturbance these prints caused in him. He felt 'weak at the knees'."&lt;ref name="DB II 31"/&gt;

At the same time, Weston strongly denied in his writings that he had any thought, much less intention, of recording erotic symbolism:

:"No! I had no physical thoughts, ‒ never have. I worked with clearer decision of sheer aesthetic form. I knew I was recording from within, my feeling for life as I never has before. Or better, when the negatives were actually developed, I realized what I felt, ‒ for when I worked, I was never more unconscious of what I was doing.

:No! The Shells are too much a sublimation of all of my works and life to be pigeon-holed. Others must get from them what they bring to them: evidently they do!"&lt;ref&gt;Daybooks, II, p32&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, in another entry about one of his nude images he said "I saw the repeated curves of thigh and calf, ‒ the shin bone, knee and thigh lines forming shapes not unlike great sea shells…"&lt;ref&gt;Daybooks, II, p10&lt;/ref&gt;

Weston wrote that he made twenty-eights prints of this image on at least four different types of paper,&lt;ref name=Conger&gt;{{cite book|first=Amy |last=Conger|title= Edward Weston: Photographs from the Center for Creative Photography|publisher=Tucson: Center for Creative Photography |year=1992| pages=Fig. 544}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a matte Kodak Azo and a semi-gloss Agfa Convira. In a few early versions he extended the bottom margin of the image down to the notches on the film negative.&lt;ref&gt;Conger, Fig. 544&lt;/ref&gt; Most prints measure approximately 9{{fraction|1|2}} by 7{{fraction|1|2}} in. (24 by 19&amp;nbsp;cm.)

On April 13, 2010, a print of this image made by Weston in year it was taken sold for $1,082,500 at an auction in New York. As of January, 2013, it was the fourteenth [[List of most expensive photographs|most expensive photograph]] ever sold. Weston originally sold it for $10.

Prints of this image are now in the collections of the [[Center for Creative Photography]], the [[George Eastman House]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

Some, akin to [[attorney–client privilege]], offer [[Bank secrecy|banker–client privilege]].]]
A '''non-disclosure agreement''' ('''NDA'''), also known as a '''confidentiality agreement''' ('''CA'''), '''confidential disclosure agreement''' ('''CDA'''), '''proprietary information agreement''' ('''PIA''') or '''secrecy agreement''' ('''SA'''), is a [[law|legal]] [[contract]] between at least two [[party (law)|parties]] that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to or by third parties. The most common forms of these are in [[Physician–patient privilege|doctor–patient confidentiality]] (physician–patient privilege), [[attorney–client privilege]], [[priest–penitent privilege]], and [[Bank secrecy|bank–client confidentiality]] agreements.  

It is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement. An NDA creates a confidential relationship between the parties to protect any type of confidential and proprietary information or [[trade secret]]s. As such, an NDA protects non-public business information. Like all contracts, they cannot be enforced if the [[Illegal agreement|contracted activities are felonies]]. NDAs are commonly signed when two companies, individuals, or other entities (such as partnerships, societies, etc.) are considering doing business and need to understand the processes used in each other's business for the purpose of evaluating the potential business relationship. NDAs can be "mutual", meaning both parties are restricted in their use of the materials provided, or they can restrict the use of material by a single party. It is also possible for an employee to sign an NDA or NDA-like agreement with an employer. In fact, some employment agreements will include a clause restricting employees' use and dissemination of company-owned confidential information. In legal disputes resolved by [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]], the parties often sign a confidentiality agreement relating to the terms of the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Clauses in Commercial Contracts – Is it worth the Effort? |date=March 17, 2016 |author=Henry Pharr III |publisher=Real Estate Drill Down |url=https://realestatedrilldown.com/2016/03/17/confidentiality-and-non-disclosure-clauses-in-commercial-contracts-is-it-worth-the-effort/ |quote=[M]ost landlords and tenants are united in interest in not wanting the terms of their settlement publicized in a public forum where they may be misunderstood or misinterpreted as being weak, scared or simply not feeling strongly about their business and their actions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joe Davies |year=2014 |title=Confidentiality Provisions in Settlement Agreements |publisher=Vann Attorneys |quote=If you've ever signed a settlement agreement resolving some dispute, chances are pretty good it contained a confidentiality provision.

== General types ==
A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) may be classified as unilateral, bilateral, or multilateral:

=== Unilateral ===
A unilateral NDA (sometimes  referred to as a one-way NDA) involves two parties where only one party (i.e., the disclosing party) anticipates disclosing certain information to the other party (i.e., the receiving party) and requires that the information be protected from further disclosure for some reason (e.g., maintaining the secrecy necessary to satisfy patent laws&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
 |url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/matters/matters-9405.html
 | title=Understanding Confidentiality Agreements
 | first=David V.
 | last=Radack
 | year=1994
 | work=JOM
 | publisher=[[The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society]]
 | quote=Second, the use of confidentiality agreements can prevent the forfeiture of valuable patent rights
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or legal protection for trade secrets, limiting disclosure of information prior to issuing a press release for a major announcement, or simply ensuring that a receiving party does not use or disclose information without compensating the disclosing party).

=== Bilateral ===
A bilateral NDA (sometimes referred to as a mutual NDA or a two-way NDA) involves two parties where both parties anticipate disclosing information to one another that each intends to protect from further disclosure. This type of NDA is common when businesses are considering some kind of joint venture or merger.

When presented with a unilateral NDA, some parties may insist upon a bilateral NDA, even though they anticipate that only one of the parties will disclose information under the NDA. This approach is intended to incentivize the drafter to make the provisions in the NDA more "fair and balanced" by introducing the possibility that a receiving party could later become a disclosing party or vice versa, which is not an entirely uncommon occurrence.

=== Multilateral ===
A multilateral NDA involves three or more parties where at least one of the parties anticipates disclosing information to the other parties and requires that the information be protected from further disclosure. This type of NDA eliminates the need for separate unilateral or bilateral NDAs between only two parties. E.g., a single multiparty NDA entered into by three parties who each intend to disclose information to the other two parties could be used in place of three separate bilateral NDAs between the first and second parties, second and third parties, and third and first parties.

A multilateral NDA can be advantageous because the parties involved review, execute, and implement just one agreement. However, this advantage can be offset by more complex negotiations that may be required for the parties involved to reach a unanimous consensus on a multilateral agreement.

== Content ==
A non-disclosure agreement can protect any type of information that is not generally known. However, nondisclosure agreements may also contain clauses that will protect the person receiving the information so that if they lawfully obtained the information through other sources they would not be obligated to keep the information secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/r-article-a-57763-m-4-sc-25-intellectual_property_using_confidentiality_agreements-i |title=Intellectual Property: Using Confidentiality Agreements |publisher=Yahoo! Small Business |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323220129/http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/r-article-a-57763-m-4-sc-25-intellectual_property_using_confidentiality_agreements-i |archivedate=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the nondisclosure agreement typically only requires the receiving party to maintain information in confidence when that information has been directly supplied by the disclosing party. However, it is sometimes easier to get a receiving party to sign a simple agreement that is shorter, less complex and does not contain safety provisions protecting the receiver.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

* outlining the parties to the agreement;
* the definition of what is confidential, i.e. the information to be held confidential. Modern NDAs will typically include a [[wikt:laundry list|laundry list]] of types of items which are covered, including unpublished [[patent application]]s, know-how, schema, [[finance|financial]] information, verbal representations, customer lists, vendor lists, business practices/strategies, etc.;
* the disclosure period – information not disclosed during the disclosure period (e.g., one year after the date of the NDA) is not deemed confidential;
* the exclusions from what must be kept confidential. Typically, the restrictions on the disclosure or use of the confidential data will be invalid if
** the recipient had prior knowledge of the materials;
** the recipient gained subsequent knowledge of the materials from another source;
** the materials are generally available to the public; or
** the materials are subject to a [[subpoena]] – although many practitioners regard that fact as a category of permissible disclosure, not as a categorical exclusion from confidentiality (because court-ordered secrecy provisions may apply even in case of a subpoena). In any case, a subpoena would more likely than not override a contract of any sort;
* provisions restricting the transfer of data in violation of laws governing export control and [[national security]];
* the term and conditions (in years) of the confidentiality, i.e. the time period of confidentiality;
* the term (in years) the agreement is binding;
* permission to obtain [[injunction|ex-parte injunctive relief]];
* description of the actions need to be done with the confidential materials upon agreement ending;
* the obligations of the recipient regarding the confidential information, typically including some version of obligations:
** to use the information only for enumerated purposes;
** to disclose it only to persons with a need to know the information for those purposes;
** to use appropriate efforts (not less than reasonable efforts) to keep the information secure. Reasonable efforts is often defined as a standard of care relating to confidential information that is no less rigorous than that which the recipient uses to keep its own similar information secure; and
** to ensure that anyone to whom the information is disclosed further abides by obligations restricting use, restricting disclosure, and ensuring security at least as protective as the agreement; and
* types of permissible disclosure – such as those required by [[law]] or [[court order]] (many NDAs require the receiving party to give the disclosing party prompt notice of any efforts to obtain such disclosure, and possibly to cooperate with any attempt by the disclosing party to seek judicial protection for the relevant confidential information).
* the law and [[jurisdiction]] governing the parties. The parties may choose exclusive jurisdiction of a court of a [[country]].

===Australia===
Deeds of confidentiality and fidelity (also referred to as deeds of confidentiality or confidentiality deeds) are commonly used in [[Australia]]. These documents generally serve the same purpose as and contain provisions similar to non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) used elsewhere. However, these documents are legally treated as [[deed]]s and are thus binding, unlike [[contract]]s, without [[consideration]].

===California===
In [[California]], (and some other states), there are some special circumstances relating to non-disclosure agreements and [[non-compete clause]]s. California's courts and legislature have signaled that they generally value an employee's mobility and entrepreneurship more highly than they do protectionist doctrine.&lt;ref name="Hurd1"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18777">[[File:AcademyOfMusic1870.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Academy of Music in Philadelphia.]]
The '''Philadelphia Grand Opera Company''' was the name of four different American [[opera]] companies active at the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] during the twentieth century. The last and best known of the four was founded in November 1954 with the merger of the [[Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera Company]] and the [[Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company]]. That company in turn merged with the [[Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company]] in 1975 to form the [[Opera Company of Philadelphia]]. Of the three earlier companies, only one lasted beyond one season; a company founded in 1926 which later became associated with the [[Curtis Institute of Music]] in 1929. That company closed its doors in 1932 due to financial reasons during the [[Great Depression]].

==The first Philadelphia Grand Opera Companies:1916==
The first company to be known as the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company (PGOC) was founded in 1916. Its first production, [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'', opened on December 18 of that year at the Academy of Music with [[Regina Vicarino]] in the title role, [[Forrest Lamont]] as Edgardo, and [[Ettore Martini]] conducting. Short lived, the company produced one more opera in December 1916, [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Il trovatore]]'', before disbanding.&lt;ref name="PGOC"&gt;[[Free Library of Philadelphia]]: ''Folder: Philadelphia Grand Opera Company 1916&amp;ndash;1934 miscellaneous''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salmaggi's Philadelphia Grand Opera Companies:1920-1921==
The second company to be known as the PGOC was actually a company based out of New York City that was active in both NYC and Philadelphia. The company was founded by [[impresario]] [[Alfred Salmaggi]] (later founder of the [[Salmaggi Opera Company]]) in the spring of 1920 under the name the Italian Lyric Federation. The company's first performance at the Academy of Music was Verdi's ''[[Otello]]'' on June 30, 1920 with [[Nicola Zerola]] in the title role. The company changed its name to the PGOC in November 1920 after the financial backers fired Salmaggi. From this point on the company worked out of Philadelphia, although Salmaggi countered his firing by continuing to perform works with different singers under the name of the Italian Lyric Federation in NYC. Like the first PGOC, this company was also short lived, with its last production, ''[[Rigoletto]]'', being held on [[Halloween]] of 1921.&lt;ref name="PGOC"/&gt;

==The Hammer's Philadelphia Grand Opera Companies:1926-1932==
The third PGOC was founded in 1926 by [[Helen Redington Carter]], socialite wife of well known Philadelphia neurologist [[Joseph Leidy (neurologist)|Joseph Leidy]], [[William Carl Hammer]], an importer and trumpeter, and his wife, [[Kathryn O'Gorman Hammer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HBhehuI5dbEC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;lpg=PA239&amp;dq=%22Philadelphia+Grand+Opera+Company%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NRlEPa7ebT&amp;sig=ozVKDGEmq-SiWFQJl2NGywL_18Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0KRBSp2mM43GM7TTmcEH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5 Philadelphia: A Guide to the Nation's Birthplace By Federal Writers' Project at google books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1932/07/07/archives/dr-leidy-is-dead-eminent-pby5iciam-member-of-one-of-the-oldest.html?sq=%2522Philadelphia+Grand+Opera+Company%2522&amp;scp=216&amp;st=p|title=DR.

Kathryn was a bandmaster and trombonist and she was notably the world's only female opera director at that time. Mrs. Leidy served as the opera board's president and provided a considerable amount of financial backing to get the company started. She also was able to get the opera house filled, being influential among Philadelphia's high society of the day.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,753128,00.html|title=Music: Philadelphia Curtain|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 2, 1931| accessdate=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the company's first year, the Hammers announced six performances for the first season.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; The company's first performance at the Academy of Music was a production of Verdi's ''[[Aida]]'' on October 28, 1926 with [[Vera Curtis]] in the title role, [[Jerome Uhl]] as the King of Egypt, [[John Sample]] as Radames, and [[Marta Wittkowska]] as Amneris. Other operas that season included ''Rigoletto'' with [[Millo Picco]] in the title role and [[Josephine Lucchese]] as Gilda, [[Charles Gounod]]'s ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' with [[Charles Hart (tenor)|Charles Hart]] in the title role and [[Irene Williams]] as Marguerite, [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]'' with [[Robert Steel (baritone)|Robert Steel]] as Tonio and [[Euphemia Giannini Gregory]] as Nedda, ''Otello'' with Sample in the title role and [[Chief Caupolican]] as Iago, and ''[[Carmen]]'' with Wittkowska in the title role and [[Armand Tokatyan]] as Don José.&lt;ref name="PGOC"/&gt;

During the company's first three seasons the company was struggling to get by. Kathryn was able to save the company a lot of money by making the company's costumes from [[cheesecloth]] on her home sewing-machine and begging and borrowing sets and properties at bargain prices. Largely due to her shrewd efforts the company managed to stay in the black.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; The company opened its second season on October 20, 1927 with [[Amilcare Ponchielli]]'s ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]'', starring [[Clara Jacobo]] in the title role, [[Mignon Sutorius]] as Laura, {{Interlanguage link multi|Ivan Steschenko|uk|3=Стешенко Іван Никифорович|vertical-align=sup}} as Alvise Badoero, and [[Berta Levina]] as La cieca. Conductor [[Artur Rodziński]] joined the company that year and remained one of the PGOC's major conductors through 1929. Highlights of that second season included productions of [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[Tosca]]'' with [[Martha Attwood]] in the title role and [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' with [[Lisa Roma]] as Santuzza. Highlights of the 1928&amp;ndash;1929 season included [[Franco Leoni]]'s ''[[L’oracolo]]'' with {{Interlanguage link multi|Ivan Steschenko|uk|3=Стешенко Іван Никифорович|vertical-align=sup}} as Uin-Sci and [[Adamo Didur]] as Cim-Fen, [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]'s ''[[Samson et Dalila]]'' with Sample as Samson and [[Madame Cahier]] as Dalila, [[Jules Massenet]]'s ''[[Manon]]'' with [[Hope Hampton]] in the title role and [[Ralph Errolle]] as Des Grieux, [[Eleanor Painter]] as Carmen, ''[[Il trovatore]]'' with [[Frances Peralta]] as Leonora, and ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' with [[Josephine Lucchese]] as Rosina.&lt;ref name="PGOC"/&gt;

In 1929 a major [[Windfall gain|windfall]] came to the PGOC when [[Mary Louise Curtis Bok]] offered to support the company in exchange for using the company as an outlet for opera talent in the [[Curtis Institute of Music]]. The PGOC accepted the offer and a partnership was formed with Curtis students appearing mostly in minor roles with the company.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; Plans were initially made to build a new $7,000,000 opera house for the company and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1927/10/15/archives/philadelphia-plans-a-new-opera-house-home-for-its-grand-opera.html?sq=%2522Philadelphia+Grand+Opera+Company%2522&amp;scp=15&amp;st=p|title=PHILADELPHIA PLANS A NEW OPERA HOUSE; Home for Its Grand Opera Company and Orchestra May Cost $7,000,000|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=October 15, 1927| accessdate= June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, like many projects of the day, these plans were ultimately abandoned as a result of the financial crisis of the [[Great Depression]]. Bok's support, however, did manage to keep the company afloat longer than it probably would have, producing three more seasons of opera at the Academy of Music. Indeed, the company's two major rivals, the [[Pennsylvania Grand Opera Company]] and the [[Philadelphia Civic Opera Company]], both closed their doors not long after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].&lt;ref name="Time2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,882402,00.html|title=Music: Up Go Curtains|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 3, 1930| accessdate= June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its remaining years the quality of PGOC's productions increased, particularly in regards to the sets and costumes. The quality of the singers remained high.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; A highlight of these years was the United States premiere of [[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Wozzeck]]'' on March 19, 1931 with [[Ivan Ivantzoff]] in the title role, [[Anne Roselle]] as Marie, [[Gabriel Leonoff]] as the Drum Major, [[Sergei Radamsky]] as Andres, [[Bruno Korell]] as the Captain, {{Interlanguage link multi|Ivan Steschenko|uk|3=Стешенко Іван Никифорович|vertical-align=sup}} as the Doctor, and [[Leopold Stokowski]] conducting. Stokowski also conducted the world premiere of [[Carlos Chávez]] and [[Diego Rivera]]'s ballet ''[[H. P.]]'' for the PGOC on March 31, 1932. The company was also notably the first American company to perform [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' in the original German on October 29, 1931 with Roselle in the title role and [[Charlotte Boerner]] as Chrysothemis.&lt;ref name="PGOC"/&gt;

The PGOC's final performance was a production of ''Aida'' on April 14, 1932 with Roselle in the title role, [[Aroldo Lindi]] as Radames, [[Cyrena van Gordon]] as Amneris, and [[Leo de Hierapolis]] as the King of Egypt. The company closed due to financial reasons in 1932. At the time they canceled the end of the 1931&amp;ndash;1932 season and announced the intention of commencing another season for 1933-1934.&lt;ref name="NYT3"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1932/10/02/archives/opera-suspended-in-philadelphia-the-company-plans-to-present-next.html?sq=%2522Philadelphia+Grand+Opera+Company%2522&amp;scp=220&amp;st=p|title=OPERA SUSPENDED IN PHILADELPHIA; The Company Plans to Present Next Season a New Form of "Drama With Music."|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=October 2, 1932| accessdate= June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That never happened, possibly because Mrs. Liedy and her husband both died in 1932.&lt;ref name="NYT8"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1933/02/10/archives/mrs-leidy-dies-opera-supporter-president-of-the-philadelphia-opera.html?sq=%2522Philadelphia+Grand+Opera+Company%2522&amp;scp=229&amp;st=p|title=MRS.

==The last Philadelphia Grand Opera Companies:1954-1974==
The last company to be called the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company was formed in November 1954 when the [[Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera]] and the [[Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company]] merged. [[Anthony Terracciano]] served as the company's first General Director in its first season but was then succeeded by General Manager [[Humbert A. Pelosi]] who was appointed that position at the end of the 1955&amp;ndash;1956 season.&lt;ref name="NYT5"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20816FC345F177A93CAAB178FD85F428585F9|title=Pelosi Named Opera Manager|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=July 7, 1932| accessdate= April 28, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terracciano remained with the company as an Artistic Director through the Spring of 1972. Pelosi left in March 1956 after a feud with Terracciano. He was replaced by conductor [[Giuseppe Bamboschek]] who had been working for the company since it began.&lt;ref name="NYT6"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00813FB355A137A93C3AA1788D85F438585F9|title=Bamboschek Gets Post|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=March 31, 1957| accessdate= April 28, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamboschek remained the company's director until 1961 when Terracciano was again made General Manager by longtime friend and musical colleague, Max M. Leon, who was then the opera company's president. This time Terracciano stayed on until 1972.&lt;ref name="NYT9"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30F12FD3E5D1B728DDDA80B94DB405B818AF1D3|title=Terracciano to Head Opera|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=March 31, 1961| accessdate= April 28, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although formed in 1954, the company finished the 1954&amp;ndash;1955 season performing under the title of the Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company. The company's inaugural performance as the PGOC was of ''Rigoletto'' under the baton on Giuseppe Bamboschek on October 13, 1955 at the Academy of Music. The production starred [[Frank Guarrera]] in the title role, [[Lisa di Julio]] as Gilda, and [[Eugene Conley]] as the Duke of Mantua. Other productions that first season included Puccini's ''[[La bohème]]'' (with [[Rosanna Carteri]] as Mimì, [[Jan Peerce]] as Rodolfo, and [[Virginia MacWatters]] as Musetta), ''Faust'' (with [[Robert Rounseville]] in the title role, [[Nicola Moscona]] as Méphistophélès, and [[Ellen Faull]] as Marguerite), Puccini's ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' (with [[Licia Albanese]] as Cio-cio-san, [[Walter Fredericks]] as Pinkerton, [[Margaret Roggero]] as Suzuki, and [[Cesare Bardelli]] as Sharpless), [[Italo Montemezzi]]'s ''[[L'amore dei tre re]]'' (with [[Beverly Sills]] as Fiora and [[Ramón Vinay]] as Avito), ''Il barbiere di Siviglia'' (with MacWatters as Rosina, Guarrera as Figaro, and [[Cesare Valletti]] as Almaviva), ''Cavalleria rusticana'' (with [[Maria Gasi]] as Santuzza), ''[[Pagliacci]]'' (with Fredericks as Canio and [[Eva Likova]] as Nedda), and ''[[Aida]]'' (with [[Astrid Varnay]] in the title role, [[Kurt Baum]] as Radamès, [[Claramae Turner]] as Amneris, and [[John Lawler]] as the King of Egypt).&lt;ref name="PGOC2"&gt;[[Free Library of Philadelphia]]: ''Bound: Philadelphia Grand Opera Company 1955-1974''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philadelphia Grand Opera Company remained active for two decades, producing six operas during an annual season. The company notably presented the world premiere of [[Pietro Aria]]'s ''[[Jericho Road (opera)|Jericho Road]]'' on March 12, 1969. Many notable singers performed with the company during its history including, [[John Alexander (tenor)|John Alexander]], [[Thelma Altman]], [[Salvatore Baccaloni]], [[Cesare Bardelli]], [[Gaetano Bardini]], [[Daniele Barioni]], [[Ara Berberian]], [[Frances Bible]], [[John Brownlee (baritone)|John Brownlee]], [[Giuseppe Campora]], [[Richard Cassilly]], [[George Cehanovsky]], [[Anita Cerquetti]], [[Eugene Conley]], [[Fernando Corena]], [[Viorica Cortez]], [[Mary Costa]], [[Mary Curtis Verna]], [[Jon Crain]], [[Gilda Cruz-Romo]], [[Enrico di Giuseppe]], [[Mignon Dunn]], [[Pierre Duval (singer)|Pierre Duval]], [[Otto Edelmann]], [[Rosalind Elias]], [[Edith Evans]], [[Jean Fenn]], [[Giulio Fioravanti]], [[Nicolai Gedda]], [[Leyla Gencer]], [[Bonaldo Giaiotti]], [[Tito Gobbi]], [[Thomas Hayward (tenor)|Thomas Hayward]], [[Jerome Hines]], [[Laurel Hurley]], [[Raoul Jobin]], [[Robert Kerns]], [[Dorothy Kirsten]], [[Flaviano Labò]], [[Albert Lance]], [[Brenda Lewis]], [[Thomas LoMonaco]], [[Chester Ludgin]], [[Cornell MacNeil]], [[Jean Madeira]], [[Elaine Malbin]], [[Adriana Maliponte]], [[Susanne Marsee]], [[Robert Merrill]], [[Anna Moffo]], [[Licinio Montefusco]], Irene Kramerich, Sonia Leon, [[Barry Morell]], [[Nicola Moscona]], [[Herva Nelli]], [[Birgit Nilsson]], [[Roberta Peters]], [[Louis Quilico]], [[Luciano Rampaso]], [[Nell Rankin]], [[Regina Resnik]], [[Graciela Rivera]], [[Elinor Ross]], [[Jane Shaulis]], [[Giulietta Simionato]], [[Joanna Simon (singer)|Joanna Simon]], [[Eleanor Steber]], [[Teresa Stratas]], [[Brian Sullivan (tenor)|Brian Sullivan]], [[Giuseppe Taddei]], [[Ferruccio Tagliavini]], [[Pia Tassinari]], [[Blanche Thebom]], [[Giorgio Tozzi]], [[Norman Treigle]], [[Gabriella Tucci]], [[Richard Tucker]], [[Giuseppe Valdengo]], [[Frank Valentino]], [[Luigi Vellucci]], and [[Jon Vickers]] to name just a few. The PGOC's last performance was of [[Johann Strauss II]]'s ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' on December 6, 1974 with [[Joseph Venezia]] as Alfred, [[June Fiske]] as Adele, [[Eileen Schauler]] as Rosalinde, [[Robert Goodloe]] as Eisenstein, and [[Carlo Moresco]] conducting.&lt;ref name="PGOC2"/&gt;

In the companies last three years the opera board's long-term president, [[Max Leon]], served as the company's manager after the departure of Terracciano. Experiencing some financial difficulties, the company began talks with the [[Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company]] about a possible merger in 1974. An agreement was reached and the two companies merged to form the [[Opera Company of Philadelphia]] in 1975 with Leon serving as General Director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/maxleon.html Biography of Max Leon at broadcastpioneers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48196">'''Radio propaganda''' is [[propaganda]] aimed at influencing attitudes towards a certain cause or position, delivered through radio broadcast. The power of radio propaganda came from its revolutionary nature. The radio, like later technological advances in the media, allowed information to be transmitted quickly and uniformly to vast populations. Internationally, the radio was an early and powerful recruiting tool for propaganda campaigns.

Before [[television]], radio was by far the most effective way to prevent or promote social change. In many areas, it still is. Radio propaganda can be broadcast over great distances to a large audience at a relatively low cost. Through radio, a propagandist can bring his voice and all the persuasive power of his emotions to millions of people.&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach is used in every war employing radio propaganda: aside from convincing those on the home front of the necessity of war, a different kind of propaganda must be directed towards the enemy. Radio became a powerful [[propaganda]] tool because it ignored national borders and made enemy lines more accessible. One of the most common ways hosts got the civilian and enemy populations to listen to their broadcasts was by dropping leaflets from hot air balloons or airplanes. Most programs were broadcast on selected stations at certain times of the day; the dropped leaflets explained exactly when and where the broadcasts could be heard.

==World War II==
The use of radio as a wartime propaganda tool was made famous during World War II by broadcasting organizations such as [[Voice of America]] and by shows such as [[Tokyo Rose]], [[Axis Sally]], and [[Lord Haw Haw]].

=== Nazi Germany ===
The radio was an important tool of the [[Nazi propaganda]] efforts and it has been argued that it was the Nazis who pioneered the use of what was still a relatively new technology. A few months after the break out of World War II, German propagandists were transmitting no less than eleven hours a day of programs, offering most of them in English as well.&lt;ref&gt;Chester, pg. 206&lt;/ref&gt; In the first year of Nazi propaganda programming, broadcasters attempted to destroy pro-British feeling rather than arouse pro-German sentiment. These propagandists targeted certain groups, including capitalists, Jews, and selected newspapers/politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Chester, pg. 207&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer of 1940, the Nazis had abandoned all attempts to win American sympathy and the tone of German radio broadcasts towards the [[United States]] had become critical.

German propaganda minister, [[Joseph Goebbels]], was well aware of the necessity to seize every opportunity to benefit and promote the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;Chester, pg. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Goebbels claimed the radio was the "eighth great power" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German Propaganda Archive|url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/goeb56.htm|work=The Radio as the Eight Great Power|publisher=Joseph Goebbels|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he, along with the Nazi party, recognized the power of the radio in the propaganda machine of Nazi Germany. Recognizing the importance of radio in disseminating the Nazi message, Goebbels approved a mandate whereby millions of cheap radio sets were subsidized by the government and distributed to German citizens. It was Goebbels' job to propagate the anti-Bolshevik statements of Hitler and aim them directly at neighboring countries with German-speaking minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pg. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In Goebbels' "Radio as the Eighth Great Power" speech, he proclaimed:

: “It would not have been possible for us to take power or to use it in the ways we have without the radio...It is no exaggeration to say that the German revolution, at least in the form it took, would have been impossible without the airplane and the radio…[Radio] reached the entire nation, regardless of class, standing, or religion. That was primarily the result of the tight centralization, the strong reporting, and the up-to-date nature of the German radio.”

As well as domestic broadcasts, the Nazi regime used the radio to deliver its message to both occupied territories and enemy states. One of the main targets was the [[United Kingdom]] to which [[William Joyce]] broadcast regularly, gaining him the nickname “[[Lord Haw-Haw]]” in the process. Broadcasts were also made to the [[United States]], notably through [[Robert Henry Best]] and 'Axis Sally', [[Mildred Gillars]].

===Great Britain===
British propaganda during the [[First World War]] set a new benchmark that inspired the fascist and socialist regimes during the [[Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]]; Marshal Paul von Hindenburg stated, “This English propaganda was a new weapon, or rather a weapon which had never been employed on such a scale and so ruthlessly in the past.”&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pg. 101&lt;/ref&gt; It was clear that large numbers of civilians could be mobilized for a massive war effort through persuasive techniques derived from the emerging disciplines of behavioral psychology and social sciences.

An example of effective radio propaganda by the [[United States]] for [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] is the news reports of [[Edward R. Murrow]]. When the United Kingdom stood alone to face the German onslaught in the autumn of 1940, Murrow covered the [[Battle of Britain]] and particularly the nightly [[The Blitz|bombing raids]] on [[London]]. His reports described the falling of the bombs, their impact, and the destruction they brought.&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Murrow developed his own inimitable style, known for its colourful, vivid imagery. Neither melancholy nor soapy, his reports were so rich in detail and description that listeners could almost smell the fumes from the fires burning in the streets of London and feel the heat emanating from the smoldering ruins. Without question, this was radio reporting at its best, and there was also no doubt about its impact. As he described his approach to a London newspaper in 1941, “The official news is perhaps less important than the more intimate stories of life, work, and sacrifice.”&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Murrow kept his focus squarely on the common man and how to reach him. He wanted to let the world know that the United Kingdom was fighting a “people’s war,” not a war for its colonies, as the American isolationists charged.&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted Americans to know that the UK was standing tall, united in its cause and protecting Western liberties and European civilisation. He wanted Americans to see the UK as their natural ally and hurry to extend a helping hand. Because of his reputation and impact, Murrow’s role evolved into much more than that of a broadcaster. Many say he had far greater influence than the American ambassador to London; “He was an ambassador, in a double role, representing Britain in America as well as America in Britain.... He was a diplomat without a portfolio, a spokesman for a cause.” &lt;ref&gt;Horten&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Historians believe the moment when American radio made its debut as the preeminent means of foreign news was the [[Munich Crisis]] in September 1938. Early that month, Hitler began implementing his plans to dominate Europe by demanding self-determination for Germans living in a region of Czechoslovakia known as the [[Sudetenland]]. He left few doubts that he meant to annex the Sudetenland as part of an enlarged [[German Reich]]. High-level negotiations ensued, during which Britain’s Prime Minister, [[Neville Chamberlain]], journeyed to Germany three times in less than three weeks in a desperate attempt to save the peace.&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Fearful that a European war would once again entangle them, Americans became glued to their radios for daily and sometimes hourly updates and interpretations of the latest developments of the crisis. Within a couple of days, American listeners were bombarded with news programs, special news bulletins, and expert commentary on the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg.22&lt;/ref&gt;

America’s first real venture into international broadcasting was in 1940 after Nazi victories in Europe, when the Roosevelt administration was becoming increasingly concerned about the effects of Nazi propaganda, both domestically and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1940, President Roosevelt issued an Executive Order establishing the Office of Coordination of Commercial and Cultural Relations to promote the use of government/private radio, and the [[Office of the Coordinator of Information]]. By 1942, the most famous radio program airing overseas became known as the “[[Voice of America]].” Even before the [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], the U.S. government's Office of the Coordinator of Information began providing war news and commentary to commercial American shortwave radio stations for use on a voluntary basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Walter|title=The Voice of America:Origins and Recollections|year=2009|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2009/1012/fsl/roberts_voice.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular government wartime radio show, performed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], was known as "fireside chats". Two of the most famous programs on the radio show were entitled "On National Security" and "On the Declaration of War with Japan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fireside Chats|url=http://www.history.com/topics/fireside-chats|publisher=History.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; “The Arsenal of Democracy” was a slogan coined by President Roosevelt during his national security radio broadcast delivered on December 29, 1940. Roosevelt promised to help [[Great Britain]] fight Nazi Germany by providing them with military supplies in a program known as [[Lend-Lease]], while the United States stayed out of the actual fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Arsenal of Democracy|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/fdrarsenalofdemocracy.html|publisher=American Rhetoric}}&lt;/ref&gt; This announcement was made a year before the attacks on [[Pearl Harbor]], at a time when Germany had occupied much of Europe and threatened Great Britain. The day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt delivered his famous [[Infamy Speech]] to the [[United States]], which was broadcast to the American people. The President called for a formal declaration of war on the [[Empire of Japan]]. The Infamy Speech was brief, running to just a little over seven minutes, and Roosevelt made a point of emphasizing that the United States and her interests were in grave danger. In so doing, he sought to end the [[isolationist]] stance the United States had previously been advocating concerning involvement in the war. The overall tone of the speech was one of determined [[Realism (international relations)|realism]]. Roosevelt made no attempt to glaze over the extensive damage that had been caused to the American armed forces, noting the number of American lives lost in the attack. However, he emphasized his confidence in the strength of the America to face the challenge posed by Japan.

[[File:FDRfiresidechat2.jpg|thumb|right|FDR "fireside" chats.]]

:“Yesterday, December 7th, 1941 - a date which will live in infamy - the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time, the Japanese Government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.”

:“As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense, that always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against us. No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people, in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory.”

:“Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory and our interests are in grave danger. With confidence in our armed forces, with the un-bounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph. So help us God.”

:President Franklin D. Roosevelt - December 8, 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For a Declaration of War|url=http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/fdr-infamy.htm|publisher=The History Place: Great Speeches Collection|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this declaration of war, radio became part of the propaganda campaign. Throughout the war, the attack on Pearl Harbor was frequently used in [[American propaganda]]. Direct wartime programming began shortly after the United States entry into the war. The first live broadcast to Germany, called ''Stimmen aus Amerika'' ("Voices from America") took place on Feb 1, 1942. It was introduced by "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" and included the pledge: "Today, and every day from now on, we will be with you from America to talk about the war.... The news may be good or bad for us – We will always tell you the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Walter|title=The Voice of America: Origins and Recollations|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2009/1012/fsl/roberts_voice.html|publisher=American Diplomacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Armed Forces Radio Service]] created a number of radio shows for American GIs stationed overseas.  The most popular of these "mosquito networks" was [[GI Jive]].  In Agra, India, [[Virginia C. Claudon Allen]] broadcast nightly to counter [[Tokyo Rose]].

===Famous radio shows===
During [[World War II]], American [[G.I. (military)|GIs]] in both the Pacific and European theaters of war heard anonymous voices on the radio playing carefully selected American music and extolling the virtues of Japanese and Nazi causes. The [[Disc jockey|DJs]] continuously encouraged GIs to stop fighting and constantly made false claims of American defeats and Japanese or Nazi victories. They frequently referred to specific American units and individuals by name, and in rare cases mentioned the names of loved ones back home. GIs dubbed the voice from Japan "[[Tokyo Rose]]"; two popular voices from Germany were "Axis Sally" and “[[Lord Haw-Haw]]”.

"Tokyo Rose": After being stranded in Japan while visiting her sick aunt after the United States refused to let her reenter the country after the attack on Pearl Harbor, [[Iva Toguri]] wound up at [[Radio Tokyo]] as a typist, preparing English-language scripts drafted by Japanese authorities for broadcast to the Allied troops in the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iva Toguri d’Aquino and "Tokyo Rose"|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/tokyo-rose|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Radio Tokyo, Toguri met captured Australian Major Charles Cousens and his associates, American Captain Wallace Ince and Filipino Lieutenant Normando Reyes. A supporter of the Allies in the war, she was delighted to meet soldiers who had been fighting for her side. Put off by her overt friendliness and pro-Americanism, the POWs initially suspected her of being a [[Kempeitai]] spy, but over the next few months they eventually came to trust her. When Radio Tokyo directed Cousens to include a woman DJ in his Zero Hour program, he asked for Toguri by name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iva Toguri d’Aquino and "Tokyo Rose"|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/tokyo-rose|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since their capture and conscription into Radio Tokyo, the Allied POWs had waged a covert campaign to sabotage the Japanese propaganda effort through the use of on-air innuendos, satire, and sarcastic, rushed or muffled readings. Now they had to bring a fourth party into the conspiracy, and the only person they could trust to support their efforts was Toguri. She was dubbed with the name "Tokyo Rose" and listeners came to know her by that name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iva Toguri d’Aquino and "Tokyo Rose"|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/tokyo-rose|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iva Toguri mug shot.jpg|thumb|right|Iva Toguri "Tokyo Rose".]]

After the war, the Army Counter Intelligence Corps, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], and the press continued to refer to Toguri by that name as she was taken into custody and brought to trial. Those defending Toguri stated that she was clearly "forced" to broadcast for the Japanese and was always a loyal American, shown by her many attempts to return home, which were continuously rejected. They also pointed to the lack of "tangible" evidence; American investigators never discovered any Japanese documents with the name "[[Tokyo Rose]]" because "[[Tokyo Rose]]" was a name coined by American GIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iva Toguri d’Aquino and "Tokyo Rose"|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/tokyo-rose|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the [[United States Constitution]], [[treason]] is the act of providing "aid and comfort" to an enemy. It does not say that force, loneliness, trickery, coercion, or fright are mitigating factors in favor of traitors. On October 6, 1949, Toguri was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $10,000. She served less than half that time and was pardoned by President [[Gerald Ford]].

"Axis Sally" was the pseudonym of [[Mildred Gillars]], an American broadcaster employed by the [[Third Reich]] in Nazi Germany to proliferate propaganda during World War II. By 1941, the [[U.S. State Department]] advised American nationals to return home, but Gillars chose to stay in Germany after her fiancé, a German citizen named Paul Karlson, refused to marry her if she returned to the United States. Shortly afterwards, Karlson was sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], where he died in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Axis Sally: The American behind the Alluring Voice|url=http://www.historynet.com/axis-sally.htm/1|work=Richard Lucas|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 she obtained work as an announcer with the ''Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft'' (RRG), German State Radio. On December 7, 1941, Gillars was working in the studio when the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was announced. She broke down in front of her colleagues and announced her allegiance to the East. However, since she decided to stay in Germany, Gillar was faced with the prospect of joblessness or prison, so she produced a written oath of allegiance to Germany and returned to work, her duties being limited to announcing records and participating in chat shows. She soon acquired several names amongst her GI listeners, including Berlin Bitch, Berlin Babe, Olga, and Sally, but the one that became most common was “Axis Sally.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Axis Sally: The American behind the Alluring Voice|url=http://www.historynet.com/axis-sally.htm/1|work=Richard Lucas|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AxisSallyMugshot.jpg|thumb|right|Mildred Gillars "Axis Sally".]]

Her most successful show was known as ''Home Sweet Home''. ''Home Sweet Home'' attempted to exploit the fears of American soldiers about the home front. The broadcasts were designed to make the soldiers cast doubt on their mission, their leaders, and their prospects after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Axis Sally, "The Greatest Generation," and Generation Y|url=http://www.historynet.com/axis-sally.htm/1|work=Ann Elizabeth Pfau|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another show was known as ''Midge at the Mike'', broadcast to late fall 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=U.S. Department of Justice|title=Axis Sally|journal=FoIA record|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillar played American songs interspersed with defeatist propaganda and anti-Semitic rhetoric, as well as ''G.I.’s Letter box and Medical Reports'' in 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=U.S. Department of Justice|title=Axis Sally|journal=FoIA record|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Gillars used information on wounded and captured U.S. airmen to cause fear and worry in their families. She was convicted of treason by the United States in 1949 following her capture in post-war Berlin. Her arrest came about after the U.S. attorney general specially dispatched prosecutor Victor C. Woerheide to Berlin to find and arrest Gillars. He only had one solid lead: Raymond Kurtz, a B-17 pilot shot down by the Germans, recalled that a woman who had visited his prison camp seeking interviews was the broadcaster. Gillars was indicted on September 10, 1948, and charged with 10 counts of treason, but only eight were presented at her trial, which began on January 25, 1949. The prosecution relied on the large number of her programs recorded by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to demonstrate her active participation in propaganda activities against the United States. It was also shown that she had made an oath of allegiance to Adolf Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=True to the Red, White, &amp; Blue|journal=TIME Magazine|date=Mar 7, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was sentenced to 10 to 30 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

"Lord Haw-Haw" was a pseudonym for [[William Joyce]], German radio's most prominent English-language speaker. He hosted a propaganda show on a radio program called ''Germany Calling'', broadcast by Nazi German radio to audiences in Great Britain on the station
''Reichssender Hamburg''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M.|first=Doherty|title=Nazi Wireless Propaganda: Lord Haw-Haw and British Public Opinion in the Second World War|year=2000|publisher=Edinburgh University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program started on September 18, 1939 and continued until April 30, 1945, when [[Hamburg]] was overrun by the British Army. Through his broadcasts, the [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] attempted to discourage and demoralize British, Canadian, Australian, and American troops and the British population within radio range to suppress the effectiveness of the Allied war effort through propaganda and to motivate the Allies to agree to peace terms leaving the Nazi regime intact and in power. The Nazi broadcasts prominently reported on the shooting down of Allied aircraft and the sinking of Allied ships, presenting discouraging reports of high losses and casualties among Allied forces. Although listening to his broadcasts was highly discouraged, many Britons did indeed tune into them. In 1940, at the height of his influence, Joyce had an estimated 6 million regular and 18 million occasional listeners in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weider History Group|url=http://www.historynet.com/axis-sally.htm/1|work=Axis Sally: The Americans Behind That Alluring Voice|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the war, Joyce was captured by British forces at [[Flensburg]], near the German border with [[Denmark]]. Spotting a dishevelled figure resting from gathering firewood, intelligence soldiers engaged him in conversation, asked if he was Joyce, and when he reached in his pocket for his false passport, the soldiers, believing he was armed, shot him in the buttocks, leaving four wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Martin|title=Geoffrey Perry|year=2009|publisher=The Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce was charged on the basis that, even though he had misstated his nationality to gain possession of a British passport, until it expired this entitled him to British diplomatic protection in Germany, and therefore he owed allegiance to the King of England at the time he commenced working for the Germans. Joyce was convicted and sentenced to death on September 19, 1945.

==Cold War==
By 1946, it became clear to the United States that the [[Soviet Union]] did not share the American vision of postwar collaboration for peace in Europe. Soviet authorities began to install Communist regimes in liberated territories of [[Eastern Europe]], a direct violation of the provisions in the [[Teheran Conference|Teheran]] and [[Yalta Conference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The radio became crucial in the propaganda war between the two blocs and was the main concern of both participants’ information agencies as the “war of ideas” began. In 1948, the Soviet Union organized the Communist Information Bureau ([[Cominform]]), which was formed to unite the Communist states in forthcoming struggle against “Anglo-American Imperialism.” &lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest responses in Europe was known as [[Radio in the American Sector]] (RIAS). RIAS was established in 1946 to serve the American sector in [[West Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The station's importance was magnified during the 1948 Berlin blockade, when it carried the message of Allied determination to resist Soviet intimidation. In East Germany, broadcasts included news, commentary, and cultural programs that were unavailable in the controlled media of the [[German Democratic Republic]]. The management of RIAS developed many of the techniques later used to develop [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]. The RIAS broadcasts concentrated on the idea of democracy and the importance of the breakdown of the international communications barriers erected by the Communists. The programming was generally geared towards “special groups” within the East German population, including youth, women, farmers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The broadcast became known as the “bridge” from West to East Germany over the [[Berlin Wall]].

Aside from RIAS, [[Voice of America]] (VOA) began broadcasting in 1947 in the Soviet Union for the first time as a part of U.S. foreign policy to fight the propaganda of the Soviet Union and other countries. Initially, there was only one hour per day of news and other features broadcast on the pretext of countering "more harmful instances of Soviet propaganda directed against American leaders and policies" on the part of the internal Soviet Russian-language media.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, pg. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union responded by initiating aggressive, electronic jamming of Voice of America broadcasts on April 24, 1949. This led critics to question the broadcasts' actual impact. However, after the collapse of the [[Warsaw Pact]] and the Soviet Union, interviews with participants in anti-Soviet movements verified the effectiveness of VOA broadcasts in transmitting information to socialist societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cold War Impact of VOA Broadcasts|journal=Hoover Institution and the Cold War International History Project of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|date=October 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many acknowledged the importance of propaganda as an instrument of foreign policy, it was primarily the Cold War that institutionalized propaganda as a permanent instrument of U.S. foreign policy. The Soviets suddenly increased the tempo of the war, by taking over Czechoslovakia and attempting to take complete control of Berlin. Realizing there was no further hope of considering the Soviet Union as an ally, the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] was formed in April 1949, establishing the policy of containment of Communism as the organization's priority. The escalation of the Cold War intensified America’s interest in broadcasting and information policy.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The world was entering into a new era of foreign relations; therefore, the [[United States National Security Council]] produced a study in 1949 that concluded that there was a need for the United States to have a major information program to counter Soviet aggression. The council issued document 10/2, approved by President Truman in June 1948, authorizing a comprehensive program of clandestine warfare, including [[black propaganda]], [[psychological warfare]], [[subversion]], assistance to underground resistance movements, paramilitary operations, and [[economic warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous form of anti-Soviet propaganda was the development of Radio Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty (RL), which broadcast to Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  The stations' purpose, above all, was fighting a political mission against [[Communism]] and Sovietism, against the representatives of the terrorist regimes. Its job was to mask Communist plans and expose all of those who were propagandist of Communist ideology. While other countries established international broadcasting entities, RFE/RL’s purpose was to change the form of government in foreign nations by airing news not about the country from which the broadcasts originated, but about the countries that were the targets of the broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, pg. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

President Harry Truman announced in 1950 that the United States would launch an information program known as the “Campaign of Truth.” The name was strategically picked to avoid any connotation of propaganda. The goals of the campaign included:
:1) Establish a “healthy international community” with confidence in American leadership.
:2) Present America fairly and counter “all the misrepresentations.”
:3) Discourage further Soviet encroachment by showing that American is desirous of peace but is prepared for war.
:4) Help “to roll back Soviet influence” by all means short of force, making captive people feel that they can identify with the West, weakening the morale of the Soviet military personnel, and encouraging non-Communist forces.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1950, RFE/RL began to assemble a full-fledged foreign broadcast staff, becoming more than a "mouthpiece for exiles."&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, Pg. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Teams of journalists were hired for each language service and an elaborate system of intelligence gathering provided up-to-date broadcast material. Most of this material came from a network of well-connected [[émigrés]] and interviews with travelers and defectors. The Communist regimes devoted considerable resources to countering Western broadcasts. They organized radio jamming on a massive scale, spending more on jamming than the West did on broadcasting. They placed spies in Western radio stations in an attempt to disrupt information sharing and organize [[counterpropaganda]], while also attempting to gain access to top level officials who could provide them with information controlled by [[Western media outlets]] or intelligence services.&lt;ref&gt;Parta, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; These countermeasures by foreign regimes significantly drained domestic resources, and failed to neutralize Western broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;Parta, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

During these years, the practice of propaganda became inextricably tied to the practices of [[psychological warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, psychological warfare was largely seen as an accessory to military operations, but during the Cold War psychological warfare was utilized to influence public opinion and advance foreign policy interests. Psychological warfare became, in essence, a synonym for the Cold War. It reflected the belief that the Cold War was an ideological, psychological, and cultural contest for hearts and minds that would be won or lost on the plain of public opinion. When President John F. Kennedy took office, his administration had a greater interest in the U.S. information effort than any other president up until that time.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 40&lt;/ref&gt; With Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]]’s address to the Soviet Central Committee in 1961, U.S. leaders believed the Soviet Union would be ready to seek a more limited form of conflict, emphasizing their winning of hearts and minds. The United States saw this as a good sign to use psychological resources to their advantage. However, these components of propaganda were put on hold with the [[Bay of Pigs]] scandal, the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and the abrupt end of the Kennedy Administration.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vietnam==
The first Vietnamese-language radio transmission was made on September 2, 1945, when [[Ho Chi Minh]] read out the Declaration of Independence. Prior to 1945, Vietnamese people were banned from owning radio receivers, and broadcasting was under control of the French colonial government, which established the first radio station in Vietnam, Radio Saigon, in the late 1920s. Vietnam's national radio station, now called the Voice of Vietnam, started broadcasting from [[Hanoi]] the week after declaration of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]], stating, "This is the Voice of Vietnam, broadcasting from Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.” During the [[Vietnam War]], [[Radio Hanoi]] operated as a propaganda tool of [[North Vietnam]]. Following reunification, all radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978.

"Hanoi Hannah" or Trịnh Thị Ngọ, was a Vietnamese radio personality best known for her work during the Vietnam War, when she made English-language broadcasts for North Vietnam directed at U.S. troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Search for Hanoi Hannah|url=http://www.psywarrior.com/hannah.html|work=Don North|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s, Ngo became famous among U.S. soldiers for her [[propaganda]] broadcasts on Radio Hanoi. She made three broadcasts a day, reading the list of the newly killed or imprisoned Americans, attempting to persuade U.S. GIs that the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War was unjust and immoral and playing popular U.S. anti-war songs in an attempt to incite feelings of nostalgia and homesickness amongst U.S. troops. Although she used the alias Thu Huong, the GIs usually called her "[[Hanoi Hannah]]" or "the Dragon Lady".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Search for Hanoi Hannah|url=http://www.psywarrior.com/hannah.html|work=Don North|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few were believed to have been influenced by her propaganda work and the soldiers often mocked her tactics, but they were also impressed by her military intelligence, especially when she mentioned the location of their own unit or listed specific U.S. casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Search for Hanoi Hannah|url=http://www.psywarrior.com/hannah.html|work=Don North|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, she returned to live in [[Ho Chi Minh City]] with her husband where her voice was better known in the U.S. than in her own country.

==Iraq and Afghanistan==
The United States took the lead in broadcasting [[psychological operations]] due to its superior technology and its ability to use aircraft to broadcast AM, FM and shortwave radio from directly above target audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBSNEWS|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500164_162-533414.|work=U.S. Propaganda Push in Iraq|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; America had dropped battery or crank-powered radios on third-world nations like [[Haiti]] so that the populace could hear U.S. broadcasts. In the more recent struggles in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], the United States distributed various battery and solar-powered satellite radios so that its story could be heard. The U.S. also dropped leaflets to inform Afghans about the attacks of September 11 and the Taliban, and to infiltrate Iraq with information on anti-Saddam radio programs that would be broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBSNEWS|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500164_162-533414.|work=U.S. Propaganda Push in Iraq|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Navy 030313-N-0000X-002 Coalition aircraft have been dropping leaflets encouraging Iraqis to listen for news broadcasts on special radio channels.jpg|thumb|right|Leaflets dropped by aircraft encouraging Iraqis to listen for news broadcasts on special radio channels.]]

In the 2001 [[invasion of Afghanistan]], [[psychological operations]] (PSYOP) tactics were employed to demoralize the [[Taliban]] and to win the sympathies of the Afghan population. At least six [[EC-130E Commando Solo]] aircraft were used to jam local radio transmissions and transmit replacement propaganda messages even before the United States invaded Afghanistan. The primary PSYOP objectives were used to counter adversarial propaganda, to discourage interference with humanitarian affairs activities, to support objectives against state and non-state supporters and sponsors of terrorism, and to disrupt support for and relationships among terrorist organizations. In Afghanistan, the U.S. military has long conducted propaganda campaigns to try to sway public opinion against insurgents. Today (2013), the U.S. is teaching Afghan army units how to counter Taliban propaganda, especially with local radio broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Current News Early Bird|url=http://214.14.134.30/ebird2/ebfiles/e20121105910138.html|work=U.S. Handoff In Afghanistan Includes Radio Training|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is to counter the Taliban-sponsored stations, so called "Mullah Radios," that operate mainly in the tribal areas along the Pakistani border and broadcast propaganda that helps turn public opinion against foreign troops and the pro-Western Afghan government. Radio is key to reaching the majority of Afghans; with only limited access to television, newspapers, and the Internet, most depend on radio programs for information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston.com|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2010/09/17/us_radio_takes_on_taliban_in_afghan_propaganda_war/|work=U.S. Radio takes on Taliban in Afghan Propaganda War|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Iraq War]], the U.S. implemented "[[black propaganda]]" by creating false radio personalities who disseminated pro-American information, but were supposedly supporters of [[Saddam Hussein]]. Radio Tikrit was a radio station in Iraq that broadcast programs that reflected strong support for the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and his government. The station's name is also the name of the Iraqi town where Saddam and other members of his government were born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schleifer|first=Ron|title=Reconstructing Iraq: Winning the Propaganda War in Iraq|year=2005|publisher=Middle East Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tone of Radio Tikrit's programs began to change dramatically; one show reportedly described Iraqis as being so poor that they had to sell their windows and doors. Another broadcast reported to have encouraged Iraqi soldiers to refuse the "orders of the tyrant" and to "be brave before it is too late,” suggesting that the United States may have infiltrated the station. The U.S. was also successful with the Voice of America efforts once the censorship of the Iraqi media was lifted with the removal of Saddam from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Sol|title=A Strategic Failure: American Information Control Policy in Occupied Iraq|year=2008|publisher=Military Review|pages=58–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voice of America==
[[File:Voice of America Logo.svg|thumb|right|Official logo for Voice of America.]]

Voice of America, The Voice, or VOA is the official external broadcast institution of the United States federal government, sponsoring programming for broadcast on the radio, television, and the Internet outside of the U.S. in 43 languages. Currently, VOA produces about 1,500 hours of news and feature programming each week to global audience in order, "to promote freedom and democracy and to enhance understanding through multimedia communication of accurate, objective, and balanced news, information and other programming about America and the world to audiences overseas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Board of Governors|url=http://www.bbg.gov/about-the-agency/|work=About the Agency: Our Mission|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under § 501 of the [[Smith–Mundt Act]] of 1948, the Voice of America was forbidden to broadcast directly to American citizens until July 2013&lt;ref name=chuck_nbc_2013&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/20/19502580-taxpayer-money-at-work-us-funded-foreign-broadcasts-finally-available-in-the-us|title=Taxpayer money at work: US-funded foreign broadcasts finally available in the US|first=Elizabeth|last=Chuck|publisher=NBC News|date=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it was repealed in the ''Smith-Mundt Modernization Act'' provision of the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013|National Defense Authorization Act for 2013]].&lt;ref name="smma"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hudson|first=John|title=U.S. Repeals Propaganda Ban, Spreads Government-Made News to Americans|url=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/07/12/us_backs_off_propaganda_ban_spreads_government_made_news_to_americans|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the legislation was to protect the American public from [[propaganda]] actions by its own government.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 1976, the principles were signed into law by President [[Gerald Ford]]:
:“The long-range interests of the United States are served by communicating directly with the peoples of the world by radio. To be effective, the Voice of America must win the attention and respect of listeners. These principles will therefore govern Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts:
:1. VOA will serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news. VOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive.
:2. VOA will represent America, not any single segment of American society, and will therefore present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions.
:3. VOA will present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussions and opinion on these policies.”

Today, the VOA operates shortwave radio transmitters and antenna farms at one site in the [[United States]] close to Greenville, North Carolina. The 44 languages that [[Voice of America]] currently broadcasts in include (TV broadcasts are marked with an asterisk):

From 1942 to 1945, VOA was part of the [[Office of War Information]], from 1945 to 1953, a function of the [[State Department]], and in 1953 it was placed under the [[U.S. Information Agency]]. When the USIA was abolished in 1999, the VOA was placed under the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] (BBG), where the control remains today. The BBG was established as a buffer to protect VOA and other U.S.-sponsored, non-military, international broadcasters from political interference.

In 1994, Voice of America became the first broadcast-news organization to offer continuously updated programs on the Internet in English and 44 other languages, using more than 20,000 servers across 71 countries. Since many listeners in Africa and other areas still receive much of their information via radio and have only limited access to computers, VOA continues to maintain regular shortwave-radio broadcasts.

==Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty==
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is a broadcaster funded by the [[United States Congress]] that provides news, information, and analysis to countries in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Central Asia]], and the [[Middle East]]  "where the free flow of information is either banned by government authorities or not fully developed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|url=http://www.rferl.org/section/FAQ/777.html#section5|work=Fast Facts|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  RFE/RL is supervised by the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]], alongside [[Voice of America]].

Founded as an anti-Communist propaganda source during the Cold War, RFE/RL was headquartered in [[Munich]], Germany, from 1949 to 1995. In 1995, the headquarters were moved to [[Prague]] in the [[Czech Republic]], where operations have been significantly reduced since the end of the Cold War. In addition to the headquarters, the service maintains 20 local bureaus in countries throughout their broadcast region, including a corporate office in [[Washington, D.C.]] RFE/RL broadcasts in 28 languages to 21 countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|url=http://flashvideo.rferl.org/Flashmaps/en-US/coverageOneWin/default.htm|work=Fast Facts|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Russia]], [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Iraq]].

RFE/RL was developed out of a belief that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, Pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt; American policymakers such as [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]] and [[John Foster Dulles]] acknowledged that the Cold War was essentially a “war of ideas”.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]], acting through the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], funded a long list of projects to counter the Communist appeal in Europe and the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, Pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The missions of [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] were separate from [[Voice of America]] in the sense that VOA was meant to be the voice of America, reflecting American foreign policy and disseminating world news from an official American viewpoint, whereas RFE/RL has the mission of captivating people and stimulating non-cooperation in Communist countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3653">A '''re-recording mixer''' in North America, also known as a '''dubbing mixer''' in Europe, is a [[post-production]] [[audio engineer]] who mixes recorded dialogue, sound effects and music to create the final version of a [[soundtrack]] for a [[feature film]],  [[television program]], or [[television advertisement]]. The final mix must achieve a desired sonic balance between its various elements, and must match the [[film director|director]]'s or [[sound design]]er's original vision for the project. For material intended for broadcast, the final mix must also comply with all applicable laws governing sound mixing (e.g., the [[Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act|CALM Act]] in the United States and the EBU R128 loudness protocol in Europe).  

The different names of this profession are both based on the fact that [[live sound mixing|the mixer is not mixing a live performance to a live audience]] nor [[Production sound mixer|recording live on a set]].  That is, he or she is re-recording sound already recorded elsewhere (the basis of the North American name) after passing it through mixing equipment such as a [[digital audio workstation]] and may dub in additional sounds in the process (the basis of the European name).  While mixing can be performed in a recording studio or home office, a full-size mixing stage or dubbing stage is used for feature films intended for release to movie theaters in order to help the mixer envision how the final mix will be heard in such large spaces. 

During production or earlier parts of post-production, sound editors, sound designers, sound engineers, production sound mixers and/or music editors assemble the tracks that become raw materials for the re-recording mixer to work with. Those tracks in turn originate with sounds created by professional musicians, singers, actors, or foley artists. 

The first part of the traditional re-recording process is called the "premix." In the dialog premix the re-recording mixer does preliminary processing, including making initial loudness adjustments, [[fade (audio engineering)|cross-fading]], and reducing environmental noise or [[Spill (audio)|spill]] that the on-set microphone picked up. In most instances, audio restoration software may be employed. For film or television productions, they may add a temporary/permanent music soundtrack that will have been prepared by the music editor, then the resulting work will be previewed by test audiences, and then the film or television program is re-cut and the soundtrack must be mixed again. Re-recording mixer may also augment or minimize audience reactions for television programs recorded in front of a studio audience. In some cases, a [[laugh track]] may augment these reactions.

During the "final mix" the re-recording/dubbing mixers, guided by the director or producer, must make creative decisions from moment to moment in each scene about how loud each major sound element (dialog, sound effects, laugh track and music) should be relative to each other. They also modify individual sounds when desired by adjusting their loudness and spectral content and by adding artificial reverberation. They can insert sounds into the three-dimensional space of the listening environment for a variety of venues and release formats: movie theaters, home theater systems, etc. that have stereo and multi-channel ([[5.1]], [[7.1]], etc.) sound systems.

:''The term "runestone style" in the singular may refer to the [[Urnes style]].'' 
The style or design of [[runestones]] varied during the [[Viking Age]]. The early runestones were simple in design, but towards the end of the runestone era they became increasingly complex and made by travelling [[runemaster]]s such as [[Öpir]] and [[Visäte]].

A categorization of the styles was developed by Anne-Sophie Gräslund in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Anne-Sophie |last=Gräslund |contribution=Dating the Swedish Viking-Age Rune Stones on Stylistic Grounds | title=Runes and Their Secrets: Studies in Runology| publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press| location=Copenhagen |pages=117–140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USIpSluLe10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=87-635-0428-6 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her systematization is considered to have been a break-through and is today a standard. The styles are RAK, Fp, Pr1, Pr2, Pr3, Pr4 and Pr5, and they cover the period 980-1130, which was the period during which most [[runestone]]s were made. 

The styles Pr1 and Pr2 correspond to the [[Ringerike style]], whereas Pr3, Pr4 and Pr5 belong to what is more widely known as the [[Urnes style]].&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer 2000:32&lt;/ref&gt; 

Below follows a brief presentation of the various styles by showing sample runestones according to [[Rundata]]'s annotation.

==RAK==
RAK is the oldest style and covers the period 980-1015 AD, but the Rundata project also includes the older runestones in this group, as well as younger ones. This style has no dragon heads and the ends of the runic bands are straight.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Fp==
This style is from the period c. 1010/1015 to c. 1040/1050, when Pr3 appeared. It is characterized by runic bands that end with animal heads seen from above.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Pr (profile styles)==
In the styles called Pr1, Pr2, Pr3, Pr4 and Pr5, the runic bands end with animal heads seen in profile.
===Pr1 (Ringerike style)===
This style is contemporary with FP dated to c. 1010- c. 1050 when it was succeeded by Pr3.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Pr2 (Ringerike style)===
This style is only somewhat younger than the previous style and it is dated to c. 1020- c. 1050, and it was also succeeded by Pr3.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Pr3 (Urnes style)===
This style succeeded FP, Pr1 and Pr2 and is dated to c. 1050- c. 1080.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Pr4 (Urnes style)===
This style appeared somewhat later c. 1060/1070 and lasted until c. 1100.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Pr5 (Urnes style)===
This style was the last one before runestones stopped being raised. It appeared c. 1080/1100 and lasted until c. 1130.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:U 104, Ed.jpg|[[Greece runestones#U 104|U 104]]

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==KB==
This style is used by the [[Rundata]] project, although it does not attribute it to Gräslund's model. The style is common in western Södermanland and it is characterized by bordered crosses.

The '''Society of Architectural Illustration''' was founded by Eric Monk (as the '''Society of Architectural Illustrators''') in 1975 to encourage the use of the [[architectural perspective]] or model as a valuable part of the communication process between [[architect]] and the general public. It changed its name to the Society of Architectural and Industrial Illustrators in the 1980s in a bid to increase membership. This did not work and the name was finally changed, after a protracted debate, to the '''Society of Architectural Illustration''' in the 1990s. This last name change was at the behest of the Charities Commission who insists that the Society exists for the benefit of the art and not the artist!

The SAI was the first organisation worldwide to provide the services of a [[professional body]] to the public and practitioners in Architectural Illustration and this lead has been followed in other major countries, most notably by the American Society of Architectural illustrators. SAI members work in several disciplines including illustration, animation, model making and photography.

The objectives of the SAI are to:

'''Sughra Rababi''' (1922 – 1994) was an artist from Pakistan. As a young female artist in the 1940s, she was the first woman to win the All India Painting Competition Award. A versatile painter, designer and sculptor - Rababi was truly a woman far ahead of her times.

Rababi donated most of the proceeds from sales of her art to support humanitarian causes. In recognition and memory of her artistic and charitable contributions, [[UNICEF]] created a Sughra Rababi Fund and the Mayor of San Francisco declared 19 January 1994, as Sughra Rababi Day in San Francisco.

Rababi, an accomplished Pakistani painter, did her graduate studies at the Saranagati School of Art in Karachi and her post-graduate studies at the Shantiniketan Fine Arts University in Bengal, India. Her art career spanned more than five decades and she exhibited her works in solo and group exhibitions throughout her life. Her last solo exhibition was held in 1992 in San Francisco, California. Rababi’s art was original and her style, versatile and truly her own. 
She was a prolific artist and created  landscapes, figurative and calligraphic paintings and used tempera, oil and acrylic as her mediums. Rababi was also a designer and a sculptor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3823">In the context of [[molecular symmetry]], a '''symmetry operation''' is a [[permutation]] of atoms such that the [[molecule]] or [[crystal]] is transformed into a state indistinguishable from the starting state.
Two basic facts follow from this definition, which emphasize its usefulness.
# Physical properties must be [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] with respect to symmetry operations.
# Symmetry operations can be collected together in groups which are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to [[permutation groups]].
Wavefunctions need not be invariant, because the operation can multiply them by a phase or mix states within a degenerate representation, without affecting any physical property.

== Molecules ==

=== Proper rotation operations ===

These are denoted by ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''  and are rotations of 360°/''n'', performed ''m'' times. The superscript ''m'' is omitted if it is equal to one.

''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', rotation by 360°, is called the Identity operation and is denoted by ''E'' or ''I''.

''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''n'' rotations 360°/''n'' is also an Identity operation.

=== Improper rotation operations ===

These are denoted by ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' and are rotations of 360°/''n'' followed by reflection in a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis.

''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is usually denoted as σ, a reflection operation about a mirror plane.

''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is usually denoted as ''i'', an inversion operation about an inversion centre.

When ''n'' is an even number ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''E'', but when ''n'' is odd ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2n&lt;/sup&gt;''  = ''E''.

Rotation axes, mirror planes and inversion centres are  [[Symmetry_element|symmetry elements]], not operations. The rotation axis of highest order is known as the principal rotation axis. It is conventional to set the Cartesian ''z'' axis of the molecule to contain the principal rotation axis.

=== Examples ===

[[Image:Methylene Chloride.PNG|100px|left]]Dichloromethane, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. There is a ''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' rotation axis which passes through the carbon atom and the midpoints between the two hydrogen atoms and the two chlorine atoms. Define the [[z axis]] as [[Line (mathematics)|co-linear]] with the ''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis, the ''xz'' plane  as containing CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the  ''yz'' plane as containing CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A ''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' rotation operation permutes the two hydrogen atoms  and the two chlorine atoms. Reflection in the ''yz'' plane permutes the hydrogen atoms while reflection in the ''xz'' plane permutes the chlorine atoms. The four symmetry operations ''E'', ''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', σ(''xz'')and σ(''yz'')  form the [[Point groups in three dimensions|point group]] C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;. Note that if any two operations are carried out in succession the result is the same as if a single operation of the group had been performed.
[[Image:Methane-2D-stereo.svg|100px|left]]Methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. In addition to the proper rotations of order 2 and 3 there are three mutually perpendicular ''S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes which pass half-way between the C-H bonds and six mirror planes. Note that ''S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''  = ''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.

== Crystals ==

In crystals '''screw rotations''' and/or '''glide reflections''' are additionally possible. These are rotations or reflections together with partial translation. The [[Bravais lattices]] may be considered as representing '''translational''' symmetry operations. Combinations of operations of the [[crystallographic point groups]] with the addition symmetry operations produce the 230 crystallographic [[space groups]].

'''''The Green Table''''' is a ballet by the German choreographer [[Kurt Jooss]] and his most popular work, depicting the futility of [[peacemaking|peace negotiations]] of the 1930s. It was the first work to be fully notated using [[kinetography Laban]] (Labanotation). It is in the repertoire of ballet companies worldwide, where it has been staged by Jooss himself. Since his death in 1979, his daughter Anna Markard has been responsible for stagings of the work.

== History ==
''The Green Table'' was created in [[List of 1932 ballet premieres|1932]] for the "Concours international de chorégraphie" in Paris, in which Jooss had been invited to participate. The originality of the piece won him the first prize and marked an important step in his career. Choreographed between two great conflicts, the work is a sort of generic war, a set of circumstances that produce the same result no matter where or when they are played out. So Death bears the combined iconographic attributes.&lt;ref name=Siegel&gt;Marcia Siegel, “The Green Table: Sources of a Classic”, ''Dance Research Journal'', Vol. 21, No. 1 (Spring, 1989), pp. 15-21. Web. 9 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, looking out through the thickening hedges of [[Nazism]], Jooss takes a less visionary path. ''The Green Table'' is concerned neither with the individual's struggles and redemption, nor with working out a nobler fate for mankind. Jooss dramatizes the way destructive impulses are released and shows us the consequences. His moral position is unimpeachable and he drives home his lesson in a series of stark images. Each scene works a variation on the same theme, like the 41 woodcuts in [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]]'s ''The Dance of Death''. The idea is that Death becomes everyone's partner, effectively seducing them into his dance on the same terms by which they lived their lives. No decisive action, change, or resolution is suggested, and in framing the "Dance of Death" with the stalemated parentheses of a diplomatic conference, Jooss seems to say none can be expected. The expressionists found the Dance of Death.&lt;ref name=Siegel /&gt;

Through archetypal characters Jooss revisualizes human life as a function of a larger cosmology, an enduring and spiritual sphere where perhaps even war and death can be seen in a more comprehensible scale. Undiluted essences of natural behavior, these characters are stripped of temporality and individual preference. Today, even as we feel detached from their obvious artificiality, we recognize ourselves in them, in some epic form. People will still be able to understand them in a hundred years.&lt;ref name=Siegel /&gt;

Jooss left [[Essen]], where since 1927 he had directed the Folkwangschule's dance department and experimental dance group and, since 1930, the ballet company of the Opera as well. He founded the [[Ballet Jooss]], a private company which toured Europe and performed his dances, including ''The Green Table''.

In 1971, Joffrey principal dancer [[Christian Holder]] was trained by Jooss for a revival of ''The Green Table'',&lt;ref&gt;Christian Holder, [http://www.dancemagazine.com/issues/december-2013/Rant--Rave-When-Reviving-Becomes-Revising "Rant &amp; Rave: When Reviving Becomes Revising"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172718/http://dancemagazine.com/issues/December-2013/Rant--Rave-When-Reviving-Becomes-Revising |date=2015-05-01 }}, ''Dance Magazine'', December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levin Houston, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19720708&amp;id=3TJWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=secDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2041,2954496&amp;hl=en "Joffrey Ballet strengthens impression at Wolf Trap"], ''The Free Lance-Star'', 8 July 1972: "Perhaps the oldest ballet shown in the present engagement is the timely re-enactment of the masterpiece of the Jooss Ballet—The green table, an anti-war diatribe, which first saw light in 1932.

== Plot outline ==
Lasting about 30 minutes and subtitled "A dance of death in eight scenes," ''The Green Table'' is a commentary on the futility of war and the horrors it causes. It opens with a group of diplomats (the ''Gentlemen in Black'', portrayed by the other characters in the piece, with the exception of Death) having a discussion around a rectangular table covered with a green cloth. They end up pulling guns from their pockets and shooting in the air, thus symbolizing the declaration of war.&lt;br /&gt;
The next six scenes portray different aspects of wartime: the separation from loved ones in ''The Farewells'', war itself in ''The Battle'' and ''The Partisan'', loneliness and misery in ''The Refugees'', the emotional void and the atmosphere of forced entertainment in ''The Brothel'' and, finally, the psychologically beaten and wounded survivors in ''The Aftermath.'' The ballet then ends as it began, with the "Gentlemen in Black" around the green table.

Throughout these episodes the figure of Death is triumphant, portrayed as a skeleton moving in a forceful and robot-like way, relentlessly claiming its victims. The dance ends with a repeat of the opening scene, a device the choreographer uses to show his mistrust in the talks of the diplomats; completely indifferent to the ravages of war, they continue their hypocritical negotiations.

== Analysis ==
The inspiration for the ballet, originally conceived as a solo, was provided by the medieval ''Lubecker Totentanz,'' a sequence of pictures portraying different types of people dancing with Death. Jooss gave it a contemporary setting and added the political content, which reflected his and many artists' concerns during Germany's [[Weimar Republic]].

He then worked closely with the designer Hein Heckroth and the composer Frederick Cohen to build the piece. Jooss, in fact, advocated a form of dance-theatre in which the choreography is dramatic and develops from a libretto (often his own). Choreographer, composer, and designer combine their efforts to produce a coherent work in which all the elements, in harmony with each other, convey the feelings and ideas more powerfully. This concept of a unified work of art, previously theorized by [[Richard Wagner]] and, in the 18th century, by [[Jean-Georges Noverre]], was popular among German artists in the early 20th century. Examples are found in the visual arts, for instance in the work of [[George Grosz]] and the [[Herzfelde brothers]], or in the theatre of [[Erwin Piscator]] and his dramaturgical collective.

''The Green Table'' reflects a concern for social issues and the problems of that era (shared by many artists contemporary with Jooss) such as political corruption and militaristic policies. Its style, with its cutting irony, caricature, and boldness of language, has much in common with [[Expressionism]], which flourished in the first decade of the 20th century. The cynical structure of the dance, for example, is a formal expression of this dry humour: the diplomats repeat their routine with total indifference to the real consequences of their decisions. The seriousness of their discussion is negated by the music that Jooss chose to accompany this scene: a playful [[tango music|tango]]. He also dressed the characters in masks, which gave them a grotesque look, and created movements that are exaggerations of naturalistic movement, such as gesticulating while talking, or nervously pacing up and down while thinking.

The costumes and props were chosen for their symbolic qualities: a flag for the hopeful soldier, a red dress coupled with a white scarf for the partisan, or the skeleton-like costume of Death. Jooss mastered the visual outlook of his compositions with skill; again the scene of the ''Gentlemen in Black'' provides an example of how the choreographer directed the audience to focus on a particular point of interest, which may be a dancer located on a higher plane than the rest of the group, or someone keeping still while everybody else is moving (or vice versa), or simply a convergence of the compositional lines.

His use of space for expressive purposes, as well as the foundation of his technique, stemmed from his formative training as [[Rudolf Laban]]'s student and assistant. Together they explored the interrelation between space and the body, with its various movement qualities reflecting different mental states and feelings. Jooss integrated Laban's findings and his free-style approach to dancing with the discipline of classical ballet training. The result was a new technique that emphasizes the use of the body as an expressive whole. This technique was to be absorbed and further developed by Jooss' students, among whom were [[Birgit Cullberg]] and [[Pina Bausch]].

''The Green Table'' is a mature example of this technique. It uses elements of classical ballet, such as turn-out, demi-pointe, extensions, turns, arabesques, and other ballet steps. However, there is no ''pointe'' work or any other feature that could suggest virtuoso display. The gracefulness, elegance, ethereal quality, and other affectations of classical ballet are eliminated. As with the choreography of [[Antony Tudor]], every step is used, not for its formal look, but for its intrinsic expressive value, and the meaning it conveys is often reinforced by the position of the hands: rather than the relaxed wrists of ballet, Jooss uses stretched palms, fists, reaching hands, and so on. The focus of the dancers also varies, shifting towards the centre of drama, rather than being primarily towards the audience, as in ballet.

The resulting style, called by Jooss "Essentialism," tries to capture the essence of each movement or pose, its inner motivation. Death, for instance, moves with sharp, direct, strong, and angular movements, cutting through space, advancing or pacing with clockwork regularity. In contrast is the style of the Profiteer: he has a swift and agile way of moving, his back usually curved, his cunning nature further accentuated by the indirectness of his focus and his multi-directional spatial patterns. Such elements combine to make ''The Green Table'' a truly innovative work and the depth and universality of its humanistic content give it a timeless and meaningful quality.

'''''The Motorcycle Diaries''''' ({{lang-es|Diarios de Motocicleta|links=no}}) is a [[memoir]] that traces the early travels of [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Ernesto "Che" Guevara]], then a 23-year-old medical student, and his friend [[Alberto Granado]], a 29-year-old biochemist. Leaving [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], in January 1952 on the back of a sputtering single cylinder 1939 [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]] 500cc dubbed ''La Poderosa'' ("The Mighty One"), they desired to explore the South America they only knew from books.&lt;ref name="on_the_trail"&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2004/12/19/travel/19che.html On the Trail of the Young Che Guevara] by Rachel Dodes, ''The New York Times'', December 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; During the formative odyssey Guevara is transformed by witnessing the social injustices of exploited mine workers, persecuted [[communists]], ostracized [[lepers]], and the tattered descendants of a once-great [[Inca civilization]]. By journey's end, they had travelled for a [[Childbirth|symbolic nine months]] by motorcycle, steamship, raft, horse, bus, and hitchhiking, covering more than {{convert|8000|km|miles}} across places such as the [[Andes]], [[Atacama Desert]], and the [[Amazon River Basin]]. The diary ends with a declaration by Guevara, born into an upper-middle-class family, displaying his willingness to fight and die for the cause of the poor, and his dream of seeing a united Latin America.

Ernesto Guevara spent long periods traveling around Latin America during his studies of medicine, beginning in 1948, at the [[University of Buenos Aires]]. In January 1950, Guevara attempted his first voyage. He traversed {{convert|4500|km|miles}} through the northern provinces of Argentina on a bicycle on which he installed a small engine. He arrived at San Francisco del Chañar, near [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], where his friend Alberto Granado ran the dispensary of the leper-centre. This experience allowed Guevara to have long conversations with the patients about their disease.

This pre-expedition gave Guevara a taste of what would be experienced in his more extensive South American travels. The journey broke new ground for him in activities that would become central to his life: travelling and writing a diary.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Che: A Revolutionary Life|date=1997|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=0-8021-3558-7|edition=First Paperback|location=New York, New York, USA|last1=Anderson|first1=John Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|65}} His own father said that it was preparation for his subsequent long journeys across South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynch|first1=Ernesto Guevara|editor1-last=De Toledo|editor1-first=Lucía Álvarez|title=Young Che: Memories of Che Guevara by his Father|date=2008|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York, New York, USA|isbn=978-0-307-39044-8|page=159|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guevara relied upon the hospitality of strangers that he encountered, as he and Granado would throughout their later travels. For example, following a puncture, he flagged down a lorry to take him to his next destination.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Che Guevara|date=2010|publisher=HarperCollins Ltd|isbn=978-1-44340-566-9|edition=First Canadian|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|last1=De Toledo|first1=Lucía Álvarez}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|63}} In another instance, in [[Loreto, Santiago del Estero|Loreto]], he asked for hospitality from a local police officer when he had nowhere to stay.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|54}} The trip encouraged Guevara's style of traveling that would be seen in the Motorcycle Diaries.

It was the success of his Argentinian 'raid', as he so put it, that awakened in him a desire to explore the world and prompted the commencing of new travel plans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|65}}

Upon completion of his bicycle journey, ''[[El Gráfico]]'', a sports magazine in Argentina, published a picture of Guevara on the motorbike he used for the journey. The company that manufactured the engine Ernesto adapted to his bicycle tried to use it for advertising claiming it was very strong since Guevara had gone on such a long tour using its power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.companeroche.com/index.php?id=40|title=the truth about Che Guevara: Adulthood|last=Hunt|first=Nigel|website=www.companeroche.com|language=en|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he continued studying, he also worked as a nurse on trading and petroleum ships of the Argentine national shipping-company. This allowed Guevara to travel from the south of [[Argentina]] to [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Trinidad]].

In January 1952 Guevara's older friend, [[Alberto Granado]], a biochemist, and Guevara, decided to take a year off from their medical studies to embark on a trip they had spoken of making for years: traversing South America on a motorcycle, which has metaphorically been compared to carbureted version of [[Don Quixote]]'s [[Rocinante]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/SB109597854336326564.htm Easy Revolutionary: Che Guevara Loves and Bikes In Fine 'Motorcycle Diaries'] by Joe Morgenstern, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', September 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Guevara and the 29-year-old Granado soon set off from [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]], astride a 1939 Norton 500 cc [[motorcycle]] they named ''La Poderosa II'' ("The Mighty II") with the idea of eventually spending a few weeks volunteering at the [[San Pablo, Peru|San Pablo]] Leper colony in [[Peru]] on the banks of the [[Amazon River]]. In total, the journey took Guevara through [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Panama]], and to [[Miami]], before returning home to [[Buenos Aires]].

[[Image:Che Guevara-Granado - Mapa 1er viaje - 1952.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Map of Guevara's trip with [[Alberto Granado]]. The red arrows correspond to trips by airplane, the last two of which Guevara took alone]]

The trip was carried out in the face of some opposition by Guevara's parents, who knew that their son was both a severe [[asthmatic]] and a medical student close to completing his studies. However, Granado, himself a doctor, assuaged their concerns by guaranteeing that Guevara would return to finish his degree (which he ultimately did).&lt;ref name="Telegraph11"&gt;[http://www.ottawacitizen.com/story_print.html?id=4431515&amp;sponsor= He Rode with Che]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', March 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stop: Miramar, Argentina, a small resort where Guevara's girlfriend, Chichina, was spending the summer with her upper-class family. Two days stretched into eight, and upon leaving, Chichina gave Guevara a gold bracelet. The two men crossed into [[Chile]] on February 14. At one point they introduced themselves as internationally renowned leprosy experts to a local newspaper, which wrote a glowing story about them. The travelers later used the press clipping as a way to score meals and other favors with locals along the way.

{{quote|"We are looking for the bottom part of the town. We talk to many beggars. Our noses inhale attentively the misery."| Guevara's entry on [[Valparaíso, Chile]]}}

In reference to his experience in [[Chile]], Guevara also writes: "The most important effort that needs to be done is to get rid of the uncomfortable '[[Yankee]]-friend'. It is especially at this moment an immense task, because of the great amount of dollars they have invested here and the convenience of using economical pressure whenever they believe their interests are being threatened."

{{Quote box

There we understood that our vocation, our true vocation, was to move for eternity along the roads and seas of the world. Always curious, looking into everything that came before our eyes, sniffing out each corner but only very faintly – not setting down roots in any land or staying long enough to see the substratum of things; the outer limits would suffice."

Unable to get a boat to [[Easter Island]] as they intended, they headed north, where Guevara's political consciousness began to stir as he and Granado moved into mining country.&lt;ref name="Che Guevara 2005, pg 9"&gt;Che Guevara: Symbol of Struggle, by Tony Saunois, CWI, 2005, {{ISBN|1-870958-34-9}} pg 9&lt;/ref&gt; They visited [[Chuquicamata]] copper mine, the world's largest open-pit mine and the primary source of Chile's wealth. While getting a tour of the mine he asked how many men died in its creation. At the time it was run by U.S. mining monopolies of [[Anaconda Copper|Anaconda]] and [[Kennecott Utah Copper|Kennecott]] and thus was viewed by many as a symbol of "[[imperialist]] gringo domination".&lt;ref name="Che Guevara 2005, pg 9"/&gt; A meeting with a homeless [[communist]] couple in search of mining work made a particularly strong impression on Guevara, who wrote: "By the light of the single candle ... the contracted features of the worker gave off a mysterious and tragic air ... the couple, frozen stiff in the desert night, hugging one another, were a live representation of the [[proletariat]] of any part of the world,"

In reference to the oppression against the Communist party in Chile, which at the time was outlawed, Guevara said: "It's a great pity, that they repress people like this. Apart from whether [[collectivism]], the ‘communist vermin,’ is a danger to decent life, the [[communism]] gnawing at his entrails was no more than a natural longing for something better, a [[Class struggle|protest]] against persistent hunger transformed into a love for this [[Marxist theory|strange doctrine]], whose essence he could never grasp but whose translation, 'bread for the poor,' was something he understood and, more importantly, that filled him with hope. Needless to say, workers at [[Chuquicamata]] were in a living [[Hell]]."

In [[Peru]], Guevara was impressed by the old [[Inca civilization]], forced to ride in trucks with Indians and animals after ''"The Mighty One"'' broke down. As a result, he began to develop a fraternity with the indigenous [[Peasant|campesinos]]. In March 1952 they both arrived at the Peruvian [[Tacna]]. After a discussion about the [[poverty]] in the region, Guevara referred in his notes to the words of Cuban poet [[José Marti]]: "I want to link my destiny to that of the poor of this world." In May they arrived in [[Lima]], [[Peru]] and during this time Guevara met doctor [[Hugo Pesce]], a Peruvian scientist, director of the national leprosy program, and an important local Marxist. They discussed several nights until the early morning and years later Che identified these conversations as being very important for his evolution in attitude towards life and society.

In May, Guevara and Granado left for the [[leper colony]] of San Pablo in the Peruvian [[Amazon Rainforest]], arriving there in June. During his stay Guevara complained about the miserable way the people and sick of that region had to live. Guevara also swam once from the side of the [[Amazon River]] where the doctors stayed, to the other side of the river where the [[leper]] patients lived, a considerable distance of {{convert|4|km|miles}}. He describes how there were no clothes, almost no food, and no medication. However, Guevara was moved by his time with the [[lepers]], remarking that

{{quote|"All the love and caring just consist on coming to them without gloves and medical attire, shaking their hands as any other neighbor and sitting together for a chat about anything or playing football with them."&lt;ref name = "A1950"&gt;[http://www.companeroche.com/index.php?id=40 Ernesto Che Guevara: 1950-1953]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:CheOnRaft1952.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Guevara (right) with [[Alberto Granado]] (left) aboard their "Mambo-Tango" wooden raft on the [[Amazon River]] in June 1952. The raft was a gift from the [[lepers]] whom they had treated]]

After giving consultations and treating patients for a few weeks, Guevara and Granado left aboard the Mambo-Tango raft (shown) for [[Leticia, Colombia]] via the [[Amazon River]].

While visiting [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], he wrote a letter to his mother on July 6, 1952. In the letter he described the conditions under the [[right-wing]] government of [[Conservative]] [[Laureano Gómez]] as the following: "There is more repression of individual freedom here than in any country we've been to, the police patrol the streets carrying rifles and demand your papers every few minutes". He also goes on to describe the atmosphere as "tense" and "suffocating" even hypothesizing that "a revolution may be brewing". Guevara was correct in his prognostication, as a military [[coup]] in 1953 would take place, bringing General [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]] to power.

Later that month Guevara arrived in [[Caracas]], Venezuela and from there decided to return to [[Buenos Aires]] to finish his studies in medical science. However, prior to his return, he travelled by cargo plane to [[Miami]], where the airplane's technical problems delayed him one month. To survive, he worked as a waiter and washed dishes in a Miami bar.

Although he admitted throughout that as a [[vagabond (person)|vagabond]] traveler he could only see things at surface level, he did attempt to delve beneath the sheen of the places he visited. On one occasion he went to see a woman dying of tuberculosis, leaving appalled by the failings of the public health system. This experience led him to ruminate the following reflection: "How long this present order, based on the absurd idea of caste, will last is not within my means to answer, but it's time that those who govern spent less time publicizing their own virtues and more money, much more money, funding socially useful works."

{{quote|"It is at times like this, when a doctor is conscious of his complete powerlessness, that he longs for change: a change to prevent the injustice of a system in which only a month ago this poor woman was still earning her living as a waitress, wheezing and panting but facing life with dignity. In circumstances like this, individuals in poor families who can’t pay their way become surrounded by an atmosphere of barely disguised acrimony; they stop being father, mother, sister or brother and become a purely negative factor in the struggle for life and, consequently, a source of bitterness for the healthy members of the community who resent their illness as if it were a personal insult to those who have to support them."| Guevara while treating a peasant woman dying of [[tuberculosis]]}}

Witnessing the widespread endemic [[poverty]], [[oppression]] and [[disenfranchisement]] throughout Latin America, and influenced by his readings of Marxist literature, Guevara later decided that the only solution for the region's [[Social structure|structural]] inequalities was armed [[revolution]]. His travels and readings throughout this journey  also led him to view Latin America not as a group of separate nations, but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide strategy for [[Liberty|liberation]] from what he viewed as [[Imperialism|imperialist]] and [[neo-colonialism|neo-colonial]] domination. His conception of a borderless, united, Hispanic-America sharing a common '[[mestizo]]' bond, was a theme that would prominently recur during his later activities and transformation from Ernesto the traveler, into [[Che Guevara]] the iconic revolutionary.

{{quote|I knew that when the great guiding spirit cleaves humanity into two antagonistic halves, I will be with the people.| Guevara's conclusion}}

Although it is considered to be formative, scholars have largely ignored this period of Guevara's life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Che's Travels: The Making of a Revolutionary in 1950s Latin America|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822391805|location=Durham [NC]|last1=Drinot|first1=Paulo}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|2}} However, historians and biographers now agree that the experience had a profound impact on Guevara, who later became one of the most famous [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] leaders in history. "His political and social awakening has very much to do with this face-to-face contact with poverty, exploitation, illness, and suffering", said Carlos M. Vilas, a history professor at the Universidad Nacional de Lanús in Buenos Aires, Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1014_041014_motorcycle_diaries.html|title="Motorcycle Diaries" Shows Che Guevara at Crossroads|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, [[Alberto Granado]] described their journey to the [[BBC]], stating: "The most important thing was to realise that we had a common sensibility for the things that were wrong and unjust." According to Granado, their time at the [[leper colony]] of San Pablo in the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] also proved pivotal. Recalling that they shared everything with the sick people and describing Guevara's wave on departure as follows: "I got the impression that Che was saying goodbye to institutional medicine and becoming a doctor of the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4518213.stm|title='My best friend Che'|date=2005-05-09|newspaper=BBC|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Granado later observed that by the end of their journey, "We were just a pair of [[Vagabond (person)|vagabonds]] with knapsacks on our backs, the dust of the road covering us, mere shadows of our old [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] egos."&lt;ref name = "lettersNYT" /&gt;

According to his daughter [[Aleida Guevara]] in a 2004 article, throughout the book we can see how Guevara became aware that what poor people needed was not his scientific knowledge as a doctor, but his strength and persistence to bring social change.&lt;ref name="aleida"&gt;{{cite news |title=Riding My Father's Motorcycle |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/09/opinion/09guevara.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=motorcycle+diaries&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin |author=Aleida Guevara |date=2008-10-09|accessdate=2008-04-08 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

Guevara's experience of the South American continent also helped to shape his revolutionary sensibilities. When discussing the plight of the downtrodden Indians of Peru, Granado discussed the formation of an Indian political party to begin a [[Túpac Amaru]] Indian Revolution. Guevara allegedly replied "Revolution without firing a shot? You're crazy?'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Toledo|first1=Lucía Álvarez|title=The Story of Che Guevara|date=2010|publisher=HarperCollins Ltd|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=978-1-44340-566-9|page=86|edition=First Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journey was also formative in his political beliefs, for example historian Paulo Drinot notes that the journey stimulated his sentiments of [[Pan-Americanism]] that would later shape his revolutionary behaviors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|8}}

Scholar Lucía Álvarez De Toledo argues that it was on these motorcycle travels that he "disregarded his social class and his white European racial ancestry" and retained the view of himself as an Argentine, as a member of the United America he had encountered during his travels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Toledo|first1=Lucía Álvarez|title=The Story of Che Guevara|date=2010|publisher=HarperCollins Ltd|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=978-1-44340-566-9|page=93|edition=First Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having said this, with the exception of Guatemala, Guevara showed little concern with the policies of the countries he encountered.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|4}} In total however, Guevara's travels in the 1950s played an important role in determining his view on the world "and his later revolutionary trajectory."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|17}}

==Editions==
In 2004, Che Guevara's daughter, [[Aleida Guevara]], explained that her father had not intended his diary to be published, and that it had the state of "a sheaf of typewritten pages". But already in the 1980s, his family worked on his unpublished manuscripts, and a Cuban publishing house brought out ''The Motorcycle Diaries'' for the first time in 1993.&lt;ref name="aleida" /&gt;

The director of Ocean Press insists that the book had been legally published in Cuba and that any rumors of a conspiracy to prohibit its publication there are false. He also points out that the Union of Young Communists brought out an edition, with another to be published by the Che Guevara Studies Center.  Furthermore, he has given an assurance that its publication has the support of many people including [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E5DA1731F931A35755C0A9629C8B63&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=motorcycle+diaries&amp;st=nyt|title=Che Guevara's Diaries (letter to the editor|author1=David Deutschmann |author2=Publisher and President |author3=Ocean Press) |publisher=New York Times|date=2008-06-02|accessdate=2008-04-08}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Motorcycle Diaries:  Notes on a Latin American Journey'' was published by Ocean Press and the Che Guevara Studies Center, Havana, in 2003.  The book has a preface by Aleida Guevara March and an introduction by Cintio Vitier.  This edition is edited and translated by Alexandra Keeble.

===Editing===
Some observers have questioned the full veracity of the work based on its editing. Michael Casey wrote that, "''Diaries'' is not a diary at all but rather a deliberately constructed memoir that the young Ernesto fashioned and embellished."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casey|first1=Michael|title=Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image|date=April 2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York, New York, USA|isbn=978-0-307-27930-9|page=52|edition=A Vintage Books Original}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casey argues that revisions such as these cause Guevara to blur the line between fiction and nonfiction in his writings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other scholars have taken this claim even further. Frans Weiser argues that Guevara was not the only person that was editing and reshaping his notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weiser|first1=Frans|title=Writing "Che" Writing: Apocryphal Diaries and the Deconstruction of Guevara's Myth|journal=Hispania|date=4 December 2013|volume=96|issue=4|page=703|doi=10.1353/hpn.2013.0126|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/531376/pdf|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Paulo Drinot contends that the Cuban government, as well as others, reworked the texts for self-fashioning or political benefits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, Drinot also points out that Guevara's introduction explicitly mentions how the notes are "reorganized" and "polished", and that such a practicality should in no way undermine its utility as a historical source.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|8}}

==Review==
{{Quote|"Guevara's youthful Motorcycle Diaries is rebellious in ways that are not immediately obvious. This travelogue shows Ernesto the Medical Student developing a sense of Pan-Latin Americanism that fuses the interests of indigenous Andean peasants with traditional adversaries like upper-middle-class Argentine intellectuals (i.e. Guevara). The book ventures a unified regional opposition to U.S. hegemony and global capitalism's sometimes ravaging effects on Latin America."| [[World Hum]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldhum.com/features/travel-books/nine-subversive-travel-books-non-fiction-20091109/ Nine Subversive Travel Books] by Thomas Kohnstamm, ''[[World Hum]]'', January 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Theodor Lipps''' ({{IPA-de|lɪps|lang}}; 28 July 1851 – 17 October 1914) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]], famed for his theory regarding [[aesthetics]], creating the framework for the concept of ''Einfühlung'' (empathy)'',''  defined as, "projecting oneself onto the object of perception."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodor-Lipps|title=Theodor Lipps {{!}} German psychologist|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has then led onto opening up a new branch of interdisciplinary research in the overlap between psychology and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Robin|last2=Elliott|first2=Richard George|date=December 2014|title=An Introduction to Einfühlung|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17561310.2014.11425535?needAccess=true|journal=Art in Translation|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=353–376|doi=10.1080/17561310.2014.11425535|issn=1756-1310}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biography==
Lipps was one of the most influential German university professors of his time, attracting many students from other countries. Lipps was very concerned with conceptions of art and the aesthetic, focusing much of his philosophy around such issues. Among his fervent admirers was [[Sigmund Freud]]. Lipps then being the main supporter of the idea of the [[Unconscious mind|Unconscious]].&lt;ref&gt;Pigman, G.W. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=7628894&amp;dopt=Abstract Freud and the history of empathy], ''The International journal of psycho-analysis'', 1995 Apr.; 76 (Pt 2):237–56.&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted [[Robert Vischer]]'s notions of [[empathy]] or esthetic sympathy (''Einfühlung'', literally translated to "feeling-into"). This concept of aesthetic resonance finds parallels throughout aesthetic philosophy. Late in life, Lipps adopted some ideas from [[Edmund Husserl]]. Disliking his psychologism, some of his students joined with some of Husserl's to form a new branch of philosophy called [[phenomenology of essences]]. Among them there was [[Moritz Geiger]] who wrote one of the first phenomenological essays on the essence and meaning of empathy in which the influence of Lipps is relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Gödel, Florian (2015), "An introduction to Moritz Geiger’s psychological contribution on empathy." ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''8'''(1):161–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transitional Style''' (also known as "updated classic for men", "classic with a contemporary twist", "new takes on old classics") in [[interior design]] and [[furniture design]] refers to a contemporary blend of traditional and modern styles, midway between old world traditional and the world of chrome and glass contemporary; incorporating lines that are less ornate than traditional designs, but not as severely basic as contemporary lines. As a result, transitional furniture designs are classic, timeless, and clean.

Curves combine with straight lines in a transitional style interior to deliver a look that balances both masculine and feminine attributes for a comfortable and relaxing, uncomplicated design. A lack of ornamentation and decoration with minimal accessories keeps the focus on the simplicity and sophistication of the design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hgtv.com/decorating/transitional-style/index.html  |title=HGTV, Transitional Style |publisher=Hgtv.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Color palettes are typically neutral and subtle and may be monochromatic, with color in art and accents, not upholstery and floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeportfolio.com/design-styles/style-defined-transitional.html |title=Transitional Style Defined by Lisa Frederick |date= |accessdate=2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike contemporary furniture, transitional style focuses on comfort and practicality to meet the lifestyle of an active household. The scales of furniture pieces are ample but not overwhelming. Goose feather and down fill is typically used for [[upholstered]] furniture, [[wood species]] (maple, mahogany, walnut, etc.) and wood finishing is typically warm tones but can range from a natural finish to a high-gloss [[lacquer]]. Texture is important, and a multitude of fabric selections can vary from durable materials to sophisticated, plush fabrics, with tone-on-tone or small scale graphics.  A balanced mix of several textures is often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nteriordesign.lovetoknow.com/transitional_style_interior_design.html |title=Transitional Style Interior Design by Michelle Radcliffe | date= |access-date=2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tropicália''' ({{IPA-pt|tɾopiˈkaʎɐ, tɾɔpiˈkaljɐ}}), also known as '''Tropicalismo''' {{IPA-pt|tɾopikɐˈlizmu, tɾɔpikaˈ-|}}, was a Brazilian artistic movement that arose in the late 1960s. It encompassed art forms such as theatre, poetry, and music. The movement was characterized by a combination of the popular and the avant-garde, as well as a fusion of traditional Brazilian culture with foreign influences.

Today, Tropicália is chiefly associated with the musical faction of the movement, which merged [[Music of Brazil|Brazilian]] and [[Music of Africa|African rhythms]] with [[pop-rock]]. Musicians who were part of the movement include [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Os Mutantes]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Tom Zé]], and the poet/lyricist [[Torquato Neto]], all of whom participated in the 1968 album ''[[Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis]]'', which served as a musical manifesto.

==Background==
A dominant principle of Tropicália was [[antropofagia]], a type of cultural cannibalism that encouraged the conflation of disparate influences, out of which could be created something unique. The idea was originally put forth by poet [[Oswald de Andrade]] in his ''[[Manifesto Antropófago]]'', published in 1928, and was developed further by the tropicalistas in the 1960s.

==Musical movement==
[[File:Caetano Veloso no III Festival da Música Popular.tif|thumb|[[Caetano Veloso]] performing at the third Popular Music Festival, October 21, 1967. [[Brazilian National Archives]].]]
The 1968 album [[Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis]] is regarded as the musical manifesto of the Tropicália movement. Although it was a collaborative project, the main creative forces behind the album were [[Caetano Veloso]] and [[Gilberto Gil]]. The album experimented with unusual time signatures and unorthodox song structures, and also mixed tradition with innovation. Politically, the album expressed criticism of the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|coup d'état of 1964]]. Key artists of the movement include ''[[Os Mutantes|Os Mutantes]]'', ''[[Gilberto Gil|Gilberto Gil]]'', ''[[Gal Costa|Gal Costa]]'' and ''[[Caetano Veloso|Caetano Veloso]]''.{{cn|date=October 2018}} According to [[Maya Jaggi]], "Gil was partly inspired by [[Jorge Ben Jor]], a Rio musician on the fringes of the movement, who mixed urban samba and bossa nova with rhythm and blues, soul and funk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jaggi|first=Maya|authorlink=Maya Jaggi|date=13 May 2006|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/may/13/popandrock|title=Blood on the Ground|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anarchistic, anti-authoritarian musical and lyrical expressions of the ''Tropicalistas'' soon made them a target of censorship and repression by the military junta that ruled Brazil in this period, as did the fact some of the collective, including Veloso and Gil, also actively participated in anti-government demonstrations. The Tropicalistas' passionate interest in the new wave of American and British psychedelic music of the period - most notably the work of [[The Beatles]] - also put them at odds with Marxist-influenced students on Brazil's left, whose aesthetic agenda was strongly nationalistic, and oriented towards 'traditional' Brazilian musical forms. This leftist faction vigorously rejected anything - especially Tropicalismo - which they perceived as being tainted by the corrupting influences of Western capitalist popular culture. The politico-artistic tensions between leftist students and the Tropicalistas reached a climax in September 1968, with Caetano Veloso's watershed performances at the third International Song Festival, held in the auditorium of Rio's Catholic University, where the audience not surprisingly included a large contingent of left-wing students.

[[File:Gal Costa.tif|thumb|left|upright|[[Gal Costa]] in 1969. [[Brazilian National Archives]].]]
Veloso had won a major song prize at the previous year's Festival, when he was backed by an Argentinian rock band, and although his unconventional performance caused some initial consternation, he managed to win over the crowd and was feted as a new star of Brazilian popular music. By late 1968, however, Veloso was fully immersed in the Tropicalia experiment, and his performances, which were expressly intended as provocative art "happenings", caused a near-riot. In the first round of the competition on 12 September, Veloso was initially greeted by enthusiastic applause, but the mood quickly changed when the music started. Veloso came on dressed in a bright green plastic tunic, festooned with electrical wires and necklaces strung with animal teeth, and his backing band Os Mutantes were also dressed in similarly outlandish attire. The ensemble launched into a barrage of psychedelic music, played at high volume, and Veloso further outraged the students with his overtly sexual stage movements. The crowd reacted angrily, shouting abuse at the performers and booing loudly, and their fury was only exacerbated by the surprise appearance of an American pop singer, [[John Dandurand]], who joined Veloso on stage and grunted incoherently into the microphone. 

[[File:Os Mutantes.tif|thumb|Os Mutantes, 1972. [[Brazilian National Archives]].]]
After such a powerful negative reaction, Veloso was unsure whether to appear in the second round on 15 September, but his manager convinced him to go on, and this chaotic  performance was recorded live and later released as a single. The students in the audience began hissing as soon as Veloso's name was announced, even before he had even taken the stage. Wearing the same green costume (minus the wires and necklaces), Veloso came on with Os Mutantes amid a storm of catcalls, and the group launched into a provocative new song Veloso had written for the occasion, "É Proibido Proibir" ("It is Forbidden to Forbid"), the title of which he had taken from a photo of a Parisian protest poster, which he had seen reproduced in a local magazine. The booing and jeering was soon so loud that Veloso struggled to be heard over the din, and he again deliberately taunted the leftists with his sexualised stage actions. Within a short time the performers were being pelted with fruit, vegetables, eggs and a rain of paper balls, and a section of the audience expressed their disapproval by standing up and turning their backs to the performers, prompting Os Mutantes to respond in kind by turning their backs on the audience. Infuriated by the students' reaction, Veloso stopped singing and launched into a furious improvised monologue, haranguing the students for their behaviour and denouncing what he saw as their cultural conservatism. He was then joined by Gilberto Gil, who came on stage to show his support for Veloso, and as the tumult reached a crescendo, Veloso announced he was withdrawing from the competition, and after deliberately finishing the song out of tune, the Tropicalistas defiantly walked offstage, arm-in-arm.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Langland, "Il est Interdit d’Interdire: The Transnational Experience of 1968 in Brazil", ''Estudios Interdisciplinarios de América Latina y el Caribe'', Vol. 17, No. 1 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1969, Veloso and Gil were arrested and imprisoned by the military government over the political content of their work. After two months, the two were released and subsequently forced to seek exile in [[London]], where they lived and resumed their musical careers until they were able to return to Brazil in 1972. 

In 1993, Veloso and Gil released the album ''[[:pt:Tropicália 2|Tropicália 2]]'', celebrating 25 years of the movement and commemorating their earlier musical experiments.&lt;ref name=behague&gt;{{cite journal |last=[[Béhague, Gerard]] |date=Spring–Summer 2006 |title=Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music (1985&amp;ndash;95) |journal=Latin American Music Review |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=79–90 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/latin_american_music_review/v027/27.1behague08.html |doi=10.1353/lat.2006.0021 |first1=Gerard. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Carmen Miranda in The Gang's All Here trailer cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Carmen Miranda]] in 1950. Although initially despised by national intellectuals, Miranda's [[kitsch]] and [[campy]] aesthetic exaggeration and association with a tropical, stereotypical Brazil was embraced by tropicália.]]
The singer and actress [[Carmen Miranda]] is considered a forerunner of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tropicalia.com.br/ruidos-pulsativos/geleia-geral/carmen-miranda Carmen Miranda - Tropicália]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tropicalismo has been cited as an influence by rock musicians such as [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]], [[Beck]], [[The Bird and the Bee]], [[Arto Lindsay]], [[Devendra Banhart]], [[El Guincho]], [[Of Montreal]], and [[Nelly Furtado]]. In 1998, [[Beck]] released ''[[Mutations (Beck album)|Mutations]]'', the title of which is a tribute to Os Mutantes. Its hit single, "[[Tropicalia (Beck song)|Tropicalia]]", reached number 21 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Modern Rock singles chart.

In 2002 Caetano Veloso published an account of the Tropicália movement, ''Tropical Truth: A Story of Music and Revolution in Brazil''.  The 1999 compilation ''Tropicália Essentials'', featuring songs by [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Tom Zé]], and [[Os Mutantes]], is an introduction to the style. Other compilations include ''The Tropicalia Style'' (1996), ''Tropicália 30 Anos'' (1997), ''Tropicalia: Millennium'' (1999), ''Tropicalia: Gold'' (2002), and ''Novo Millennium: Tropicalia'' (2005). Yet another compilation, ''Tropicalia: A Brazilian Revolution In Sound'', was released to acclaim in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/various/tropicalia |title=Tropicalia: A Brazilian Revolution In Sound |accessdate=2008-05-16 |author=Staff |work=[[Metacritic]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 documentary film, ''Tropicália'', was made on the subject and artists in general; directed by Brazilian filmmaker Marcelo Machado, where [[Fernando Meirelles]] served as one of its executive producers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1497880/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kongo people|Kongo]] place stone figures called '''tumba''' (a [[Kongo language|Ki-Kongo]] word, pl. bitumba) on the graves of powerful people. Bitumba were created in [[Zaire]] and [[Angola]] during the nineteenth century and the first part of the twentieth. The term tumba comes from the old [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word for “tomb”— this genre may have been inspired by grave monuments for European merchants and missionaries in [[Kongo Kingdom|Kongo]] cemeteries.

==Materials and Dimensions==
Bituma were executed in soft stone. Their average height it close to 50 centimeters; the smallest bituma measure between 15 and 20 centimeters and the largest are approximately a meter in height.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert Farris|title=The four moments of the sun : Kongo art in two worlds|year=1981|publisher=National Gallery of Art|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=089468003X|author2=Cornet, Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist Robert Verly gathered a large number of statues in the north of Angola near the Zaire border and, in the May 1955 issue of Zaire, he classified the objects by type and proposed an explanation for their use.&lt;ref name="Verly 1955"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verly|first=Robert|title=La Statuaire de pierre du Bas-Congo (Bamboma-Musurongo)|journal=Zaire|year=1955|volume=5|location=Brussels}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1978, the Institut des Musees Nationaux du [[Zaire]] at the Center for International Commerce of Zaire in [[Kinshasa]] mounted an exhibition of 72 bitumba called "Sculptures Stones from Lower Zaire."&lt;ref name="Cornet 1978"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornet|first=Joseph|title=Pierres sculptees du Bas-Zaire|year=1978|location=Kinshasa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles and Themes==
Bitumba sculptures are unique in their variety of styles. Robert Farris Thompson has identified about twenty workshops that explain stylistic individuality. The wide dispersal of the works, however, has made it impossible to localize their centers of production. 

Bitumba are express a variety of themes. The most widely found - about twenty percent of statues belong to this type - is a figure who raises his hands in front of his face in a gesture often interpreted as praying. The second most prevalent theme is that of mother and child. The art of Lower Zaire, and especially the art of [[Mayombe]], is known for privileging [[maternity]] subjects. The third theme is that of the "thinker," who holds on hand on the hip and the other pressed to check in an attitude of meditation.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981" /&gt;

==Background==
Uchronia catalogues and chronicles over 3300 published alternate history novels, short stories, anthologies, collections, series, as well as including reference material and works published in other languages. Entries indicate the original publication date, the [[point of divergence]] and a brief synopsis of the plot. A search mechanism that can identify works by author, keyword or language of publication/translation is also included.

Uchronia features a couple of real-world timelines: one devoted to alternate histories published before the [[Golden Age of Science Fiction]], and another offering a complex chronological outline of point of divergences of the entries.&lt;ref name=sf1 /&gt;

Uchronia contains large cover art gallery and links to [[Amazon.com]] in order to obtain the listed alternate history books.&lt;ref name=sf2 /&gt;

Uchronia also hosts the main website for the [[Sidewise Award for Alternate History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uchronia.net/sidewise/ |title=The Sidewise Awards for Alternate History |accessdate=4 October 2018 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Uchronia.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Buddy Bears''''' is the name given to painted, life-size [[fiberglass]] bear sculptures developed by  [[Klaus and Eva Herlitz]], in cooperation with  [[sculptor]] [[Roman Strobl]]. The raised arms of the standing Buddy Bears are aligned on the dissemination of friendliness and optimism, and thus mediate a positive mood.  "The Buddy Bear has become an unofficial ambassador for Germany and is a symbol of Berlin since 2001. The story of the Buddy Bears started with an artistic event in Berlin in 2001. Inspired by the idea of bringing art in the streets of a metropolis like the [[CowParade|cow parade]] in Zurich and New York."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azernews.az/culture/92771.html|title=Kapellhaus hosts "Buddy Bear" award ceremony|date=11 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Classic Buddy Bears presented far beyond Berlin’s city limits, the circle of United Buddy Bears came into being in 2002. The Exhibition travel around the world promoting  "peace, international understanding and tolerance among the nations, cultures and religions of this world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specsspaces.com/Blogger/KastleWaserman/Article/ArtisticBearHugBerlinsBuddyBears.aspx ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first activities were presented as the ''Buddy Bear Berlin Show''. In 2001, artists painted approximately 350 bears to appear in the public domain, as decorative elements in the streets of Berlin. Four different bear designs (one standing on all four paws, one standing on two legs, one standing on its head and one in a sitting position) took part in this activity in the city centre of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fruitsq.com/gs/berlin/buddy.html Buddy Bears on the streets of Berlin], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, many of the bears were sold at auctions in aid of child relief organisations.  Nowadays, these Berlin Buddy Bears are exclusively presented on private premises, in front of hotels and embassies as well as in the foyers of various office buildings.

There have already been exhibitions of the original ''Buddy Bears''  — designed by local artists — in the cities of [[Shanghai]] (2004), [[Buenos Aires]] (2005) and [[St. Gallen]] / [[Switzerland]] (2006).

''United Buddy Bears'' is an international art exhibition with more than 140 two metre tall fiberglass bears. Under the motto: "We have to get to know each other better, it makes us understand one another better, trust each other more, and live together more peacefully", more than 140 countries acknowledged by the [[United Nations]] are represented, promoting  "tolerance, international understanding and the great concept of different nations and cultures living in peace and harmony". The bears stand "hand in hand" in a "peaceful circle" ('''The Art of Tolerance'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cherryelsewhere.wordpress.com/tag/united-buddy-bears/|title=The Art of Tolerance|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The bears were on display between June and November 2002, in a circle around the [[Brandenburg Gate]]. Around 1.5 million people visited this first exhibition.

On 6 November 2002, the bears were moved to new locations, including their respective countries [[Embassy|embassies]] in Berlin, or back to country that they were based on. Some of the bears were auctioned off to raise money for [[UNICEF]].

After the circle of "United Buddy Bears" had been such an overwhelming success in 2002, a new circle was created in 2003. The idea was to send the circle on a global tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddy-baer.com/en/united-buddy-bears/world-tour/overview.html |title=Global Tour |publisher=Buddy-baer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On their global tour, the "United Buddy Bears" promote peace, love, tolerance and international understanding. The circle changes every time it reaches a new city. This is not only due to the local conditions, but also to their constantly changing order, as the bears are always set up in alphabetic order, following the local language of the host country. This always leads to new and sometimes politically very interesting proximities.

Entry to the exhibitions is always free. This makes it possible for many school classes to visit the exhibitions in the morning — as part of their lessons — to explore and learn a lot about the culture, history, landscape, economy and music of all five continents in a playful manner. During past exhibitions more than 40 million visitors have already admired the colorful United Buddy Bears.

In every metropolis, the United Buddy Bears exhibitions are supported by the government, the foreign ministries, the mayors and the UNICEF organisations. Heads of state – for example the Japanese [[Prime Minister]], [[Junichiro Koizumi]], the German [[President of Germany|Federal President]], [[Horst Köhler]] and First Lady of Egypt, [[Suzanne Mubarak]] as well as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors such as Sir [[Peter Ustinov]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080816050318/http://www.buddy-baer.com/typo3temp/pics/044b41489f.jpg ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jackie Chan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackiechankids.com/files/Buddy_Bear_Factory_Visit.htm |title=Jackie Chan and the Buddy Bears |publisher=Jackiechankids.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christiane Hörbiger]], [[Mia Farrow]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6207/1664/1600/mia%20farrow.jpg |title=Mia Farrow and United Buddy Bears |publisher=Photos1.blogger.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iris Berben]] and [[Ken Done]] have opened these exhibitions all over the world. ''United Buddy Bears Special Ambassador'' is the actress [[Dennenesch Zoudé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddy-baer.com/en/united-buddy-bears/world-tour/berlin-20092010/message-of-greetings.html |title=Dennenesch Zoudé and United Buddy Bears |publisher=Buddy-baer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aid for children in need==
Buddy Bear activities and help for children in need have formed an inseparable unit.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} New ''United Buddy Bears'' are often{{quantify|date=April 2016}} designed to replace the previous unique sculpture of a particular country. Many countries are already represented with the third or fourth bear. The previous bears designed on behalf of the respective countries are generally sold at auctions.

{{As of | 2018 | September}} donations and selling ''Buddy Bears'' at auction had generated a total of [[Euro]] 2,300,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddy-baer.com/en/charity/charity-activities/overview.html|title=Buddy Bears -&amp;nbsp;Charity Activities - Overview|website=www.buddy-baer.com|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in aid of UNICEF and of local organisations helping children in need.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Involved artists==
In the early years, the Bears were designed by regional artists and Berlin celebrities for the exhibition ''Art in the City''.&lt;ref&gt;Eva und Klaus Herlitz: ''Buddy Bär Berlin Show'', page 20, 21 ff, Neptun Verlag AG, CH-8280 Kreuzlingen, {{ISBN|3-85820-152-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2002 onwards, thanks to support from [[Lufthansa]], [[Air Berlin]] and the [[:de:Deutscher Hotel- und Gaststättenverband|Berlin Hotel Association]], artists from all five continents took part in the
international project ''United Buddy Bears''. More than 240 artists from over 150 countries have taken part in this project to date,&lt;ref&gt;Eva und Klaus Herlitz: ''United Buddy Bears — The Art of Tolerance'', Page 52 – 357, Berlin, 2009/10, {{ISBN|978-3-00-029417-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; such as, for example [[Arik Brauer]], [[René Cadena Ayala]], [[:de:Hernando León|Hernando León]], [[Ibrahim Hazimeh]], [[Carlos Páez Vilaró]], [[SEO (artist)|Seo Soo-Kyoung]], [[:de:Helge Leiberg|Helge Leiberg]], [[Leda Luss Luyken]], [[Ludmila Seefried-Matějková]] – this is also echoed by the artist and UNICEF Australian National Ambassador, [[Ken Done]].

In 1902 he studied at the School of the [[Society for the Furthering of the Arts]] in [[St. Petersburg]]. From 1903 to 1907 he attended the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in St. Petersburg.

In 1908 he exhibited with the group [[Zveno (art)|Zveno]] (The Link) in [[Kiev]] organized by the artist [[David Burliuk]] and his brother [[Wladimir Burliuk]].
