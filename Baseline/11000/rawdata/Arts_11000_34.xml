(1993) ''Substantiv-Derivation in Den Schriften Albrecht Dürers'', Walter de Gruyter. {{ISBN|3-11-012815-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[German art|painter]], [[Old master prints|printmaker]], and [[history of geometry#Renaissance|theorist]] of the [[German Renaissance]]. Born in [[Free Imperial City of Nuremberg|Nuremberg]], Dürer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties due to his high-quality [[List of woodcuts by Dürer|woodcut prints]].
He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and from 1512 he was patronized by Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]. Dürer is commemorated by both the Lutheran and Episcopal Churches.

Dürer's vast body of work includes [[List of engravings by Dürer|engraving]]s, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, [[watercolour]]s and books. The woodcuts, such as the ''[[Apocalypse (Dürer)|Apocalypse]]'' series (1498), are more [[Gothic art|Gothic]] than the rest of his work. 
His well-known engravings include the ''[[Knight, Death, and the Devil]]'' (1513), ''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (Dürer)|Saint Jerome in his Study]]'' (1514) and ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European [[landscape art]]ists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium.

Dürer's introduction of [[Roman mythology|classical motifs]] into Northern art, through his knowledge of [[Italian Renaissance|Italian artists]] and [[Humanism in Germany|German humanists]], has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the [[Northern Renaissance]]. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, [[linear perspective|perspective]], and [[body proportions|ideal proportions]].

==Early life (1471–1490)==
[[File:Self-portrait at 13 by Albrecht Dürer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Self-portrait]] [[silverpoint]] drawing by the thirteen-year-old Dürer, 1484]]

Dürer was born on 21 May 1471, third child and second son of his parents, who had at least fourteen and possibly as many as eighteen children.  His father, [[Albrecht Dürer the Elder]] (originally Albrecht Ajtósi), was a successful [[goldsmith]] who in 1455 had moved to Nuremberg from {{ill|Ajtós|hu|Ajtós|fr|Ajtós}}, near [[Gyula (town)|Gyula]] in [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name="heaton"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Life of Albrecht Dürer of Nürnberg: With a Translation of His Letters and Journal and an Account of His Works|first=Mrs. Charles|last=Heaton|authorlink=Mary Margaret Heaton|publisher=Seeley, Jackson and Halliday|year=1881|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=netZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Albrecht's brothers, [[Hans Dürer]], was also a painter and trained under him. Another of Albrecht's brothers, Endres Dürer, took over their father's business and was a master goldsmith.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=Dürer – oi|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095736400?rskey=Y8iIbB&amp;result=0&amp;q=durer|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|doi=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German name "Dürer" is a translation from the Hungarian, "Ajtósi".&lt;ref name="heaton"/&gt; Initially, it was "Türer", meaning doormaker, which is "ajtós" in Hungarian (from "ajtó", meaning door). A door is featured in the [[coat-of-arms]] the family acquired. Albrecht Dürer the Younger later changed "Türer", his father's diction of the family's surname, to "Dürer", to adapt to the local Nuremberg dialect. Dürer the Elder married Barbara Holper, daughter of his master when he himself qualified as a master in 1467.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum, 93, note 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Coat of Arms of the House of Dürer - WGA07258.jpg|thumb|upright|Woodcut by Dürer of his [[coat of arms]], which featured a door as a pun on his name, as well as the winged bust of a [[Moors|Moor]]]]

Dürer's godfather was [[Anton Koberger]], who left goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher in the year of Dürer's birth, and became the most successful publisher in Germany, eventually owning twenty-four [[printing-press]]es and built a number of offices in Germany and abroad. Koberger's most famous publication was the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'', published in 1493 in German and Latin editions. It contained an unprecedented 1,809 [[woodcut]] illustrations (albeit with many repeated uses of the same block) by the [[Wolgemut]] workshop. Dürer may have worked on some of these, as the work on the project began while he was with Wolgemut.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"&gt;Giulia Bartrum, "Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy", British Museum Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7141-2633-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Dürer left autobiographical writings and became very famous by his mid-twenties, his life is well documented by several sources. After a few years of school, Dürer started to learn the basics of goldsmithing and drawing from his father. Though his father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith, he showed such a precocious talent in drawing that he started as an apprentice to [[Michael Wolgemut]] at the age of fifteen in 1486. A self-portrait, a drawing in [[silverpoint]], is dated 1484 ([[Albertina, Vienna]]) "when I was a child", as his later inscription says. Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time, with a large workshop producing a variety of works of art, in particular woodcuts for books. Nuremberg was then an important and prosperous city, a centre for publishing and many luxury trades. It had strong links with Italy, especially [[Venice]], a relatively short distance across the [[Alps]].&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt;

==''Wanderjahre'' and marriage (1490–1494)==
[[File:Albrecht-self.jpg|thumb|left|The earliest painted ''[[Portrait of the Artist Holding a Thistle (Albrecht Dürer)|Self-Portrait]]'' (1493) by Albrecht Dürer, oil, originally on [[vellum]] ([[Louvre]], [[Paris]])]]

After completing his apprenticeship, Dürer followed the common German custom of taking ''[[Wanderjahre]]''—in effect [[gap year]]s—in which the apprentice learned skills from artists in other areas; Dürer was to spend about four years away.  He left in 1490, possibly to work under [[Martin Schongauer]], the leading engraver of Northern Europe, but who died shortly before Dürer's arrival at [[Colmar]] in 1492. It is unclear where Dürer travelled in the intervening period, though it is likely that he went to [[Frankfurt]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In Colmar, Dürer was welcomed by Schongauer's brothers, the goldsmiths Caspar and Paul and the painter Ludwig. In 1493 Dürer went to [[Strasbourg]], where he would have experienced the sculpture of [[Nikolaus Gerhaert]]. Dürer's first painted self-portrait (now in the [[Louvre]]) was painted at this time, probably to be sent back to his fiancée in Nuremberg.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt;

In early 1492 Dürer travelled to [[Basel]] to stay with another brother of Martin Schongauer, the goldsmith Georg.&lt;ref&gt;Here he produced a woodcut of [[St Jerome]] as a frontispiece for Nicholaus Kessler's 'Epistolare beati Hieronymi'. [[Erwin Panofsky]] argues that this print combined the '[[Ulm]]ian style' of Koberger's 'Lives of the Saints' (1488) and that of Wolgemut's workshop. Panofsky, 21&lt;/ref&gt; Very soon after his return to Nuremberg, on 7 July 1494, at the age of 23, Dürer was married to [[Agnes Frey]] following an arrangement made during his absence. Agnes was the daughter of a prominent brass worker (and amateur harpist) in the city. However, no children resulted from the marriage, and with Albrecht the Dürer name died out. The marriage between Agnes and Albrecht was not a generally happy one, as indicated by the letters of Dürer in which he quipped to [[Willibald Pirckheimer]] in an extremely rough tone about his wife. He called her an "old crow" and made other vulgar remarks. Pirckheimer also made no secret of his antipathy towards Agnes, describing her as a miserly shrew with a bitter tongue, who helped cause Dürer's death at a young age.&lt;ref name="Wilmot-BuxtonPoynter1881"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harry John Wilmot-Buxton|author2=Edward John Poynter|title=German, Flemish and Dutch Painting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aLgnAAAAYAAJ|year=1881|publisher=Scribner and Welford|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated by many scholars Albrecht was bisexual, if not homosexual, due to several of his works containing themes of homosexual desire, as well as the intimate nature of his correspondence with certain very close male friends.&lt;ref name="Haggerty2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Haggerty|title=Encyclopedia of Gay Histories and Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pez9AQAAQBAJ|date=5 November 2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-135-58513-6|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First journey to Italy (1494–1495)==
[[File:Agnes Duerer 1494.jpg|thumb|upright|Dürer's sketch of his wife Agnes Frey 1494]]

Within three months of his marriage, Dürer left for Italy, alone, perhaps stimulated by an outbreak of [[Black Death|plague]] in Nuremberg. He made watercolour sketches as he traveled over the Alps. Some have survived and others may be deduced from accurate landscapes of real places in his later work, for example his engraving ''Nemesis''.

In Italy, he went to Venice to study its more advanced artistic world.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Lee, Raymond L. &amp; Alistair B. Fraser. (2001) ''The Rainbow Bridge'', Penn State Press. {{ISBN|0-271-01977-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Through Wolgemut's tutelage, Dürer had learned how to make prints in [[drypoint]] and design [[woodcut]]s in the German style, based on the works of [[Martin Schongauer]] and the [[Housebook Master]].&lt;ref name=Lee /&gt; He also would have had access to some Italian works in Germany, but the two visits he made to Italy had an enormous influence on him. He wrote that [[Giovanni Bellini]] was the oldest and still the best of the artists in Venice. His drawings and engravings show the influence of others, notably [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]], with his interest in the proportions of the body; [[Lorenzo di Credi]]; and [[Andrea Mantegna]], whose work he produced copies of while training.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Angela and Raftery, Andrew. "Remaking Dürer: Investigating the Master Engravings by Masterful Engraving," [http://artinprint.org/article/remaking-durer-investigating-the-master-engravings/ ''Art in Print'' Vol. 2 No. 4] (November–December 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer probably also visited [[Padua, Italy|Padua]] and [[Mantua]] on this trip.&lt;ref&gt;The evidence for this trip is not conclusive; the suggestion it happened is supported by Panofsky (in his Albrecht Dürer, 1943) and others, but it has been disputed by other scholars, including Katherine Crawford Luber (in her Albrecht Dürer and the Venetian Renaissance, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Nuremberg (1495–1505)==
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Melencolia I - Google Art Project (427760).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Melencolia I]]'' (1514), engraving]]

On his return to [[Nuremberg]] in 1495, Dürer opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this). Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Dürer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1514. Arguably his best works in the first years of the workshop were his [[woodcut]] prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as ''The Men's Bath House'' (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition.

It is now thought unlikely that Dürer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Dürer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.

His famous series of sixteen great designs for the ''Apocalypse&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.payer.de/christentum/apokalypse.htm Johannesapokalypse in klassischen Comics]&lt;/ref&gt;'' is dated 1498, as is his engraving of'' [[St. Michael Fighting the Dragon-Albrecht Durer|St. Michael Fighting the Dragon]]''. He made the first seven scenes of the ''Great Passion'' in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the [[Holy Family]] and saints. The ''[[Polyptych of the Seven Sorrows|Seven Sorrows Polyptych]]'', commissioned by [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III of Saxony]] in 1496, was executed by Dürer and his assistants c. 1500. Around 1503–1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'', which he did not finish for some years. Neither these, nor the ''Great Passion,'' were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt;

During the same period Dürer trained himself in the difficult art of using the [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] to make engravings. It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father, as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith. In 1496 he executed the ''Prodigal Son'', which the Italian Renaissance art historian [[Giorgio Vasari]] singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality. He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably ''Nemesis'' (1502), ''The Sea Monster'' (1498), and ''Saint Eustace'' (c. 1501), with a highly detailed landscape background and animals. His landscapes of this period, such as ''Pond in the Woods'' and ''Willow Mill'', are quite different from his earlier watercolours. There is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere, rather than depicting topography. He made a number of [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]s, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures. Prints are highly portable and these works made Dürer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt;

[[File:Albrecht Dürer Betende Hände.jpg|upright|thumb|''[[Praying Hands (Dürer)|Praying Hands]]'', pen-and-ink drawing (c. 1508)]]

The Venetian artist [[Jacopo de' Barbari]], whom Dürer had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and Dürer said that he learned much about the new developments in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], [[anatomy]], and [[Body proportions|proportion]] from him.  De' Barbari was unwilling to explain everything he knew, so Dürer began his own studies, which would become a lifelong preoccupation. A series of extant drawings show Dürer's experiments in human proportion, leading to the famous engraving of ''[[Adam and Eve (Dürer)|Adam and Eve]]'' (1504), which shows his subtlety while using the burin in the texturing of flesh surfaces.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt; This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name.

Dürer created large numbers of preparatory drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the ''[[Betende Hände]]'' (''Praying Hands'') from circa 1508, a study for an apostle in the Heller altarpiece. He continued to make images in watercolour and [[bodycolour]] (usually combined), including a number of still lifes of meadow sections or animals, including his ''[[Young Hare]]'' (1502) and the ''[[Great Piece of Turf]]'' (1503).

==Second journey to Italy (1505–1507)==
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Jesus among the Doctors - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Christ among the Doctors (Dürer)|Christ among the Doctors]]'' (1506), [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]]]]

In Italy, he returned to painting, at first producing a series of works executed in [[tempera]] on [[linen]]. These include portraits and altarpieces, notably, the [[Paumgartner altarpiece]] and the ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Dürer)|Adoration of the Magi]]''. In early 1506, he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507.&lt;ref name=Mueller /&gt; By this time Dürer's engravings had attained great popularity and were being copied. In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of [[San Bartolomeo, Venice|San Bartolomeo]]. This was the altar-piece known as the ''[[Feast of the Rosary|Adoration of the Virgin]]'' or the ''Feast of Rose Garlands''. It includes portraits of members of Venice's German community, but shows a strong Italian influence. It was subsequently acquired by the Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] and taken to Prague. Other paintings Dürer produced in Venice include ''The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch'', ''[[Christ among the Doctors (Dürer)|Christ among the Doctors]]'' (supposedly produced in a mere five days), and a number of smaller works.

==Nuremberg and the masterworks (1507–1520)==
[[File:Albrecht Dürer, Adam and Eve, 1504, Engraving.jpg|thumb|''Adam and Eve'', 1504]]
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Adam and Eve (Prado) 2.jpg|thumb|''[[Adam and Eve (Dürer)|Adam and Eve]]'', 1507, [[Museo del Prado]]]]

Despite the regard in which he was held by the Venetians, Dürer returned to Nuremberg by mid-1507, remaining in Germany until 1520. His reputation had spread throughout Europe and he was on friendly terms and in communication with most of the major artists including [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]] and—mainly through [[Lorenzo di Credi]]—[[Leonardo da Vinci]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Between 1507 and 1511 Dürer worked on some of his most celebrated paintings: ''[[Adam and Eve (Dürer)|Adam and Eve]]'' (1507), ''[[The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand (Dürer)|The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand]]'' (1508, for Frederick of Saxony), ''Virgin with the Iris'' (1508), the altarpiece ''Assumption of the Virgin'' (1509, for Jacob Heller of Frankfurt), and ''[[Adoration of the Trinity]]'' (1511, for Matthaeus Landauer). During this period he also completed two woodcut series, the Great Passion and the Life of the Virgin, both published in 1511 together with a second edition of the Apocalypse series. The post-Venetian woodcuts show Dürer's development of [[chiaroscuro]] modelling effects,&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 135&lt;/ref&gt; creating a mid-tone throughout the print to which the highlights and shadows can be contrasted.

Other works from this period include the thirty-seven woodcut subjects of the Little Passion, published first in 1511, and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512. Indeed, complaining that painting did not make enough money to justify the time spent when compared to his prints, he produced no paintings from 1513 to 1516. However, in 1513 and 1514 Dürer created his three most famous [[engraving]]s: ''[[Knight, Death, and the Devil]]'' (1513, probably based on [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]'s treatise ''[[Enchiridion militis Christiani]]''), ''[[St. Jerome in His Study (Dürer)|St. Jerome in his Study]]'', and the much-debated ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (both 1514). Further outstanding pen and ink drawings of Dürer´s period of art work of 1513 were drafts for his friend Willibald Prickheimer. These drafts were later used to design the famous chandeliers [[lusterweibchen]].

In 1515, he created his ''[[Dürer's Rhinoceros|woodcut of a Rhinoceros]]'' which had arrived in [[Lisbon]] from a written description and sketch by another artist, without ever seeing the animal himself. An image of the [[Indian rhinoceros]], the image has such force that it remains one of his best-known and was still used in some German school science text-books as late as last century.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt; In the years leading to 1520 he produced a wide range of works, including the woodblocks for the first western printed star charts in 1515&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/durer.htm Dürer's hemispheres of 1515—the first European printed star charts]&lt;/ref&gt; and portraits in [[tempera]] on [[linen]] in 1516. His only experiments with [[etching]] came in this period, producing five 1515–1516 and a sixth 1518; a technique he may have abandoned as unsuited to his aesthetic of methodical, classical form.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Brian D.

===Patronage of Maximilian I===
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Maximilian I'']]

From 1512, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] became Dürer's major patron. His commissions included ''[[The Triumphal Arch]]'', a vast work printed from 192 separate blocks, the symbolism of which is partly informed by Pirckheimer's translation of [[Horapollo]]'s ''Hieroglyphica''. The design program and explanations were devised by [[Johannes Stabius]], the architectural design by the master builder and court-painter Jörg Kölderer and the woodcutting itself by Hieronymous Andreae, with Dürer as designer-in-chief. ''The Arch'' was followed by ''[[The Triumphal Procession]]'', the program of which was worked out in 1512 by [[:de:Marx Treitzsaurwein|Marx Treitz-Saurwein]] and includes woodcuts by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] and [[Hans Springinklee]], as well as Dürer.

Dürer worked with pen on the marginal images for an edition of the Emperor's printed Prayer-Book; these were quite unknown until facsimiles were published in 1808 as part of the first book published in [[lithography]]. Dürer's work on the book was halted for an unknown reason, and the decoration was continued by artists including [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and [[Hans Baldung]]. Dürer also made several portraits of the Emperor, including one shortly before Maximilian's death in 1519.

==Journey to the Netherlands (1520–1521)==
[[File:Bezoek van Albrecht Dürer in Antwerpen in 1520, Henri Leys, 1855, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten Antwerpen, 2198.jpg|thumb|400px|Visit of Albrecht Dürer in Antwerp in 1520, Henri Leys, 1855, [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp]], 2198]]
Maximilian's death came at a time when Dürer was concerned he was losing "my sight and freedom of hand" (perhaps caused by [[arthritis]]) and increasingly affected by the writings of [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum, 204. Quotation from a letter to the secretary of the Elector of Saxony&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1520 Dürer made his fourth and last major journey, to renew the Imperial pension Maximilian had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who was to be crowned at [[Aachen]]. Dürer journeyed with his wife and her maid via the [[Rhine]] to [[Cologne]] and then to [[Antwerp]], where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in [[silverpoint]], chalk and charcoal. In addition to going to the coronation, he made excursions to Cologne (where he admired the painting of [[Stefan Lochner]]), [[Nijmegen]], [['s-Hertogenbosch]], [[Bruges]] (where he saw [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Madonna of Bruges]]), [[Ghent]] (where he admired [[Jan van Eyck|van Eyck]]'s altarpiece), and [[Zeeland]].

Dürer took a large stock of prints with him and wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged or sold them, and for how much. This provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time. Unlike paintings, their sale was very rarely documented.&lt;ref&gt;Landau &amp; Parshall:350-54 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; While providing valuable documentary evidence, Dürer's Netherlandish diary also reveals that the trip was not a profitable one. For example, Dürer offered his last portrait of Maximilian to his daughter, [[Margaret of Habsburg (1480–1530)|Margaret of Austria]], but eventually traded the picture for some white cloth after Margaret disliked the portrait and declined to accept it. During this trip he also met [[Bernard van Orley]], [[Jan Provoost]], [[Gerard Horenbout]], [[Jean Mone]], [[Joachim Patinir]] and [[Tommaso Vincidor]], though he did not, it seems, meet [[Quentin Matsys]].&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 209&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of [[Christian II of Denmark]], Dürer went to Brussels to paint the King's portrait. There he saw "the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land"—the [[Aztec]] treasure that [[Hernán Cortés]] had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of Mexico. Dürer wrote that this treasure "was much more beautiful to me than miracles. These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]]s".&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt; Dürer also appears to have been collecting for his own [[cabinet of curiosities]], and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of [[coral]], some large fish fins, and a wooden weapon from the [[East Indies]].

Having secured his pension, Dürer finally returned home in July 1521, having caught an undetermined illness—perhaps [[malaria]]&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky&lt;/ref&gt;—which afflicted him for the rest of his life, and greatly reduced his rate of work.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt;

==Final years in Nuremberg (1521–1528)==
[[File:Albrecht Dürer 100.jpg|thumb|''Salvator Mundi'', an unfinished oil painting on wood, full painting]]

On his return to Nuremberg, Dürer worked on a number of grand projects with religious themes, including a crucifixion scene and a [[Sacra conversazione]], though neither was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 223&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been due in part to his declining health, but perhaps also because of the time he gave to the preparation of his theoretical works on geometry and perspective, the [[body proportions|proportions]] of men and horses, and [[fortification]].

However, one consequence of this shift in emphasis was that during the last years of his life, Dürer produced comparatively little as an artist. In painting, there was only a portrait of [[commons:File:Albrecht Dürer 078.jpg|Hieronymus Holtzschuher]], a [[commons:File:Albrecht Dürer 061.jpg|''Madonna and Child'' (1526)]], [[commons:File:Albrecht dürer salvator mundi.JPG|''Salvator Mundi '' (1526)]], and two panels showing [[John the Apostle|St. John]] with [[St. Peter]] in [[commons:File:Albrecht Dürer 026.jpg|background]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] with [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]] in the [[commons:File:Albrecht Dürer 027.jpg|background]]. This last great work, [[the Four Apostles]], was given by Dürer to the City of Nuremberg—although he was given 100 guilders in return.&lt;ref name="Panofsky"/&gt;

[[File:Dürer Salvator Mundi detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A close up reveals Dürer's highly detailed preparatory drawing]]

As for engravings, Dürer's work was restricted to portraits and illustrations for his treatise. The portraits include Cardinal-Elector [[Albert of Mainz]]; [[Frederick the Wise]], elector of Saxony; the [[Humanism|humanist]] scholar [[Willibald Pirckheimer]]; [[Philipp Melanchthon]], and [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]]. For those of [[Albert of Mainz|the Cardinal]], Melanchthon, and Dürer's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck, Dürer depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach.

Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education, Dürer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend [[Willibald Pirckheimer]], whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images.&lt;ref&gt;[[Corine Schleif]] (2010), "Albrecht Dürer between Agnes Frey and Willibald Pirckheimer", ''The Essential Dürer'', ed. Larry Silver and [[Jeffrey Chipps Smith]], Philadelphia, 85–205&lt;/ref&gt; He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars. Dürer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime. "The Four Books on Measurement" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on [[mathematics]] in German,&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt; as well as being cited later by [[Galileo]] and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. The other, a work on city fortifications, was published in 1527. "The Four Books on Human Proportion" were published posthumously, shortly after his death in 1528.&lt;ref name=Mueller /&gt;

Dürer died in Nuremberg at the age of 56, leaving an estate valued at 6,874 florins – a considerable sum.  He is buried in the ''Johannisfriedhof'' cemetery.  [[Albrecht Dürer's House|His large house]] (purchased in 1509 from the heirs of the astronomer [[Bernhard Walther]]), where his workshop was located and where his widow lived until her death in 1539, remains a prominent Nuremberg landmark.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt; It is now a museum.

===Dürer and the Reformation===
[[File:Durerhaus-nbg.jpg|thumb|[[Albrecht Dürer's House]] in [[Nuremberg]]]]

Dürer's writings suggest that he may have been sympathetic to [[Martin Luther]]'s ideas, though it is unclear if he ever left the Catholic Church. Dürer wrote of his desire to draw Luther in his diary in 1520: "And God help me that I may go to Dr. Martin Luther; thus I intend to make a portrait of him with great care and engrave him on a copper plate to create a lasting memorial of the Christian man who helped me overcome so many difficulties."&lt;ref&gt;Price (2003), 225&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[Nicholas Kratzer]] in 1524, Dürer wrote "because of our Christian faith we have to stand in scorn and danger, for we are reviled and called heretics". Most tellingly, [[Willibald Pirckheimer|Pirckheimer]] wrote in a letter to Johann Tscherte in 1530: "I confess that in the beginning I believed in Luther, like our Albert of blessed memory ... but as anyone can see, the situation has become worse." Dürer may even have contributed to the Nuremberg City Council's mandating Lutheran sermons and services in March 1525. Notably, Dürer had contacts with various reformers, such as [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Andreas Karlstadt]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]], [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] and Cornelius Grapheus from whom Dürer received Luther's ''[[On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church|Babylonian Captivity]]'' in 1520.&lt;ref&gt;Price:225–248&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nürnberger Feldschlange.JPG|thumb|right|''The Cannon'', Dürer's largest etching, 1518]]

Dürer's later works have also been claimed to show [[Protestant]] sympathies. For example, his woodcut of ''[[The Last Supper]]'' of 1523 has often been understood to have an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] theme, focussing as it does on Christ espousing the [[Gospel]], as well the inclusion of the [[Eucharist]]ic cup, an expression of Protestant [[Utraquist|utraquism]],&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; although this interpretation has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Price:254&lt;/ref&gt; The delaying of the engraving of [[Philip the Apostle|St Philip]], completed in 1523 but not distributed until 1526, may have been due to Dürer's uneasiness with images of Saints; even if Dürer was not an [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]], in his last years he evaluated and questioned the role of art in religion.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and influence==

[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Adorazione dei Magi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Adoration of the Magi'' (1504), oil on wood [[Galleria degli Uffizi]], [[Florence]]]]

Dürer exerted a huge influence on the artists of succeeding generations, especially in printmaking, the medium through which his contemporaries mostly experienced his art, as his paintings were predominantly in private collections located in only a few cities. His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as [[Raphael]], [[Titian]], and [[Parmigianino]], all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work.

His work in [[engraving]] seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the "[[Little Masters]]" who attempted few large engravings but continued Dürer's themes in small, rather cramped compositions. [[Lucas van Leyden]] was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century. The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of Dürer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds ([[Giulio Campagnola]], [[Giovanni Battista Palumba]], [[Benedetto Montagna]] and [[Cristofano Robetta]]), or whole prints ([[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and [[Agostino Veneziano]]). However, Dürer's influence became less dominant after 1515, when Marcantonio perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also.

In painting, Dürer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles. His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style. Dürer has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the ''Dürer Renaissance'' of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German [[nationalism]] from 1870 to 1945.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt;

Dürer's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by [[D'Arcy Thompson]] in his book ''On Growth and Form''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thompson, D'Arcy|year=1917|title=On Growth and Form|place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=290–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lutheran Church]] remembers Dürer as a great Christian annually on 6 April,&lt;ref&gt;''Lutheranism 101'' edited by Scot A. Kinnaman, CPH, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and [[Hans Burgkmair]]. The [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (United States)]] remembers him, Cranach and [[Matthias Grünewald]] on 5 August.

==Theoretical works==

In all his theoretical works, in order to communicate his theories in the [[German language]] rather than in [[Latin]], Dürer used graphic expressions based on a [[vernacular]], craftsmen's language. For example, "Schneckenlinie" ("snail-line") was his term for a spiral form. Thus, Dürer contributed to the expansion in German prose which [[Martin Luther]] had begun with his translation of the [[Luther Bible|Bible]].&lt;ref name="Panofsky"&gt;Erwin Panofsky, ''The Life and Art of Albrecht Dürer'', Princeton, 1945, {{ISBN|0-691-00303-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Four Books on Measurement''===
{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}
Dürer's work on [[geometry]] is called the ''Four Books on Measurement'' (''Underweysung der Messung mit dem Zirckel und Richtscheyt'' or ''Instructions for Measuring with [[Compass (drawing tool)|Compass]] and Ruler'').&lt;ref&gt;A. Koyre, "The Exact Sciences", in ''The Beginnings of Modern Science'', edited by Rene Taton, translated by A. J. Pomerans&lt;/ref&gt; The first book focuses on linear geometry. Dürer's geometric constructions include [[helices]], [[Conchoid (mathematics)|conchoids]] and [[epicycloid]]s. He also draws on [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]], and [[Johannes Werner]]'s 'Libellus super viginti duobus elementis conicis' of 1522.

The second book moves onto two dimensional geometry, i.e. the construction of regular [[polygon]]s. Here Dürer favours the methods of [[Ptolemy]] over [[Euclid]]. The third book applies these principles of geometry to [[architecture]], [[engineering]] and [[typography]].

In architecture Dürer cites [[Vitruvius]] but elaborates his own classical designs and [[classical orders|columns]]. In [[typography]], Dürer depicts the geometric construction of the [[Latin alphabet]], relying on [[History of western typography#Classical revival|Italian precedent]]. However, his construction of the [[Gothic alphabet]] is based upon an entirely different [[modular]] system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]]. Here Dürer discusses the five [[Platonic solid]]s, as well as seven [[Archimedean solid|Archimedean]] semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention.

In all these, Dürer shows the objects as [[Net (polyhedron)|nets]]. Finally, Dürer discusses the [[Doubling the cube|Delian Problem]] and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through [[linear perspective]]. It was in [[Bologna]] that Dürer was taught (possibly by [[Luca Pacioli]] or [[Bramante]]) the principles of [[linear perspective]], and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of [[Piero della Francesca]]. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Although Dürer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Dürer discusses in this last book of ''Underweysung der Messung'' an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

===''Four Books on Human Proportion''===
[[File:Dürer - Vier Bücher von menschlicher Proportion ita., 1594 - 168613 Illustrazione 3v.jpg|thumb|Illustration from the ''Four Books on Human Proportion'']]

Dürer's work on [[body proportions|human proportions]] is called the ''Four Books on Human Proportion'' (''Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion'') of 1528.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/hierinnsindbegri00dure|title=Hierinn sind begriffen vier Bucher von menschlicher Proportion durch Albrechten Durer von Nurerberg|last=Durer|first=Albrecht|date=1528|publisher=Hieronymus Andreae Formschneider|access-date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book was mainly composed by 1512/13 and completed by 1523, showing five differently constructed types of both male and female figures, all parts of the body expressed in fractions of the total height. Dürer based these constructions on both [[Vitruvius]] and empirical observations of, "two to three hundred living persons",&lt;ref name="Panofsky"/&gt; in his own words. The second book includes eight further types, broken down not into fractions but an [[Leone Battista Alberti|Albertian]] system, which Dürer probably learned from [[Francesco di Giorgio]]'s 'De harmonica mundi totius' of 1525. In the third book, Dürer gives principles by which the proportions of the figures can be modified, including the mathematical simulation of [[convex mirror|convex]] and [[concave mirror]]s; here Dürer also deals with human [[physiognomy]]. The fourth book is devoted to the theory of movement.

Appended to the last book, however, is a self-contained essay on aesthetics, which Dürer worked on between 1512 and 1528, and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning 'ideal beauty'. Dürer rejected Alberti's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety. Nonetheless, Dürer still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code. In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), naïve approval ('Wohlgefallen') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass'). However, unlike Alberti and Leonardo, Dürer was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images. Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528, Dürer's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or [[artistic inspiration|inspired]] to a concept of 'selective inward synthesis'.&lt;ref name="Panofsky"/&gt; In other words, that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things. Dürer's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that "one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day, or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron, and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year".&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 283&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Borscht Belt''', or '''Jewish Alps''', is a nickname for the (now mostly defunct) summer resorts of the [[Catskill Mountains]] in parts of [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan]], [[Orange County, New York|Orange]], and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster]] counties in [[New York (state)|New York]]. [[Borscht]], a soup associated with immigrants from eastern Europe, was a colloquialism for "Jewish". These resorts were a popular vacation spot for [[New York City]] [[Jews]] between the 1920s and the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/1995-96/95-062i.html |title=Catskills Institute: Jewish scholars study history, cultural significance of the Borscht Belt | publisher= [[Brown University]]| location=Providence, Rhode Island| date=November 29, 1995|accessdate= August 21, 2017| archivedate= August 20, 2017|

Most Borscht Belt resorts hosted traveling Jewish comedians and musicians, and many who later became famous began their careers there.

The tradition of Borscht Belt entertainment started in the early twentieth century with the indoor and outdoor theaters constructed on a 40-acre (16-hectare) tract in [[Hunter, New York|Hunter]], New York, by [[Yiddish theater]] star [[Boris Thomashefsky]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2017/08/21/545027326/jerry-lewis-on-his-borscht-belt-childhood-and-the-lonely-work-of-comedy&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1987 films ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' and ''[[Maureen Stapleton#Filmography|Sweet Lorraine]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080518/NEWS/80518002|title=Overnight fire destroys Heiden Hotel of 'Sweet Lorraine' fame|work=[[Times Herald-Record]]|location=Middletown, New York|publisher=Dow Jones Local Media Group, Inc.|date=May 18, 2008|accessdate=June 9, 2010|archivedate=February 1, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130201165544/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080518/NEWS/80518002|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflect on the bygone era.

Beginning in the 1980s, the growth of air travel made the Catskills less attractive, so many of the resorts eventually closed, although Jewish culture has remained present. A large percentage of the region comprises summer homes and bungalow colonies (including many of the historic colonies) for [[Orthodox Jewish]] families,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Frankfurter|first=Yitzchok|title=Ruins of the Borscht Belt|url=https://issuu.com/amimagazine/docs/epub_ami136|magazine=[[Ami (magazine)|Ami]]|date=Sep 15, 2013|issue=136|page=172|access-date=Nov 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily from the [[New York metropolitan area]], as well as year-round dwellers.

Resorts still are operating in the region, including Villa Roma, an Italian American resort, [[Soyuzivka]] and Xenia, Ukrainian cultural resorts, and the Skazka and Hotel Pine, Russian cultural resorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skazka.us|website=Skazka.us|title=Skazka Resort|date=|accessdate=2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xeniaresort.net|title=Xenia Resort|website= XeniaResort.net|date=|accessdate=2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianresort.net|title=Hotel Pine|website=RussianResort.net|date=|accessdate=2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, motorsports enthusiasts are drawn to the area visiting the [[Monticello Motor Club]].

==History==
Borscht Belt hotels, bungalow colonies, [[summer camp]]s, and קאָך-אַליינס ''kokh-aleyns'' (a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] name for self-catered [[boarding house]]s, literally, "cook-alones") were frequented by families of middle and working class Jewish New Yorkers, mostly [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish immigrants.
[[Antisemitism]], particularly in the 1940s, '50s, and '60s, meant that they were often denied accommodation elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;E. Raab and G.J. Selznick: Major Social Problems. Joanna Cotler Books, 1974 (3rd edition). {{ISBN|0060452994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Catskill hotels were converted from farms that immigrant Jews had started in the early 1900s. As the area grew, it began to cater specifically to Jews, providing kosher food, synagogues, and other features of Jewish communities, including entertainment. The area became known as "The Jewish Alps", and the [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan County]] portion as "Solomon County".&lt;ref name="hvmag"&gt;{{cite web | last=Levine | first=David | date=August 8, 2014 | title=History of Borscht Belt Hotels and Bungalow Colonies in the Catskills | url=http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/August-2014/History-of-Borscht-Belt-Hotels-and-Bungalow-Colonies-in-the-Catskills/ | work=[[Hudson Valley (magazine)|Hudson Valley]] | publisher=Today Media | accessdate=May 26, 2017 | archivedate=2016-09-18 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918130642/http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/August-2014/History-of-Borscht-Belt-Hotels-and-Bungalow-Colonies-in-the-Catskills/# | deadurl=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millions of tourists, especially New Yorkers, came to swim in the lakes and oversized hotel pools, to ski or ice-skate&lt;ref name="Tablet Mag" /&gt; or take lessons in golf, tennis, and dancing. No fewer than 538 hotels sprang up in this area of Eastern New York.&lt;ref name="Tablet Mag"/&gt;

Well known resorts in the area included [[Concord Resort Hotel|The Concord]], [[Grossinger's]], [[Brickman's]], [[Brown's Hotel (Catskills)|Brown's Hotel]], [[Kutsher's Hotel|Kutsher's Hotel and Country Club]], the [[Nevele Grand Hotel|Nevele]], Friar Tuck Inn, Gibber's, Gilbert's, Granit, the Woodbine Hotel, the Heiden Hotel, Irvington, Lansman's, The Laurels Hotel and Country Club, The Pines Resort, [[Raleigh Hotel (South Fallsburg, New York)|Raleigh]], Silverman's River View Hotel, Stevensville, Stiers, the Tamarack Lodge, the Olympic, and the Windsor Regency.

Two of the larger hotels in High View (north of [[Bloomingburg, New York|Bloomingburg]]) were Shawanga Lodge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Dan | first = Abby |date=n.d. | title= History | url=http://shawanga.com | publisher=Shawanga.com (fan site) |accessdate= November 11, 2016| archivedate=May 21, 2017| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170521222001/http://shawanga.com/| deadurl=no}} Collection of photographs and memorabilia.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Overlook. In 1959, the Shawanga hosted a conference that marked the beginning of serious research into lasers.&lt;ref name='Beam'&gt;{{cite book | last = Hecht | first = Jeff | title = Beam: the race to make the laser | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | location = Oxford, UK | page = 101 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6jOnlRViWPoC | isbn = 978-0-19-514210-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel burned to the ground in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Roosa | first=Monoka A. | date= 2007 | title= Mamakating | publisher = Arcadia Publishing| location= publocation | page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Overlook had entertainment and summer lodging through the late 1960s and was operated by the Schrier family. It included a main building and about 50 other bungalows, plus a five-unit cottage just across the street. It remains in a different form, no longer functioning as it was in its heyday.

The [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway|New York, Ontario &amp; Western Railway]] carried passengers to the resorts from [[Weehawken, New Jersey]], until 1948. The railroad was abandoned in 1957. Despite the improvement of roads such as the original [[New York State Route 17]], the area is no longer a major travel destination.

The decline of the Catskills resorts was apparent as early as 1965. Entertainment in America was changing as the country ushered in the [[jet age]].&lt;ref name="Tablet Mag" /&gt; As ethnic barriers in the U.S. began to fall and travel to distant resorts became easier and cheaper, fewer Jewish American families in New York City went to the Catskills. By the early 1960s, between a quarter and a third of Grossinger's annual visitors were non-Jewish.&lt;ref name=AJones&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Abigail|title=Beautiful ruins: The Catskills may be dying, but the memories live on|url=http://forward.com/articles/183901/rediscovering-beauty-amid-ruins-of-once-glorious-c/?p=all|accessdate=October 27, 2013|work=The Forward|publisher=The Forward Association| date=September 27, 2013|archivedate= March 6, 2016|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160306111031/http://forward.com/culture/183901/rediscovering-beauty-amid-ruins-of-once-glorious-c/?p=all|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the universalization of [[air conditioning|air-conditioned]] hotels across America drew customers away from the aging resorts primarily built before this innovation became popular.&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun mistake" /&gt; In the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|social and cultural upheavals of the 1960s]], traditional resort vacations lost their appeal for many younger adults.&lt;ref name=AJones /&gt;

Smaller, more modest hotels such as Youngs Gap and the Ambassador found themselves in a niche with a vanishing clientele and closed by the end of the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} By the mid-1990s, nearly 300 hotels and motels had gone out of business in Sullivan County.&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun mistake" /&gt;

The 1970s took a toll on more lavish establishments such as the Flagler and The Laurels.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5it7KmNphMo&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 Grossinger's closed for renovations, and the property was abandoned by new owners midway through work. Grossinger's largest historic rival (and the largest of all the Borscht Belt resorts), the Concord, benefitted only temporarily, filing for bankruptcy in 1997 and closing a year later.

In 1987, New York's mayor [[Ed Koch]] proposed buying the Gibber Hotel in Kiamesha Lake to house the homeless. The idea was opposed by local officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Joyce Purnick | first=Joyce | last=Purnick | date=April 4, 1987 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/04/nyregion/catskills-hotel-suggested-for-homeless.html | work=The New York Times | title=Catskills Hotel Suggested For Homeless | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel instead became a religious school, like many old hotels in the Catskills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catskills.brown.edu/hotelframes.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228045158/http://catskills.brown.edu/hotelframes.html |date=February 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
{{update|date=September 2017}}

Plans are now in place by those who purchased the former Borscht Belt resorts [[Concord Resort Hotel]] and [[Grossinger's]] to work with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in an attempt to bring gambling to the region. Because the Borscht Belt's prime has long passed and many of the resorts are abandoned, developers believe this is the only way to revitalize the region to the popularity it once had by attracting guests to world-class casinos and resorts such as the ones in [[New Jersey]] and [[Connecticut]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} However, large-scale casino plans have not come to fruition, mainly because there are no [[Indian reservation]]s anywhere near the area (the [[Mohawk tribe]]'s effort to build a Catskills casino was rejected for this very reason). Instead, the state government proposed legalizing off-reservation gambling, which required a positive referendum, passed in November 2013.

The Heiden Hotel in [[South Fallsburg, New York|South Fallsburg]], which was the location of the movie ''[[Maureen Stapleton#Filmography|Sweet Lorraine]]'' starring [[Maureen Stapleton]], was destroyed by fire in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080518/NEWS/80518002|title=Overnight fire destroys Heiden Hotel of 'Sweet Lorraine' fame|work=[[Times Herald-Record]]|location=Middletown, New York|publisher=Dow Jones Local Media Group, Inc.|date=May 18, 2008|accessdate=June 9, 2010|archivedate=February 1, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130201165544/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080518/NEWS/80518002|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cabaret Scene''''' (1922) is a painting by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[Salvador Dalí]]. It was a unique [[Cubism|cubist]] experiment that came between Dalí's early [[Impressionism|impressionist]] work and the classic [[Surrealism|surrealist]] technique he would later develop. Dalí was inspired by [[Pablo Picasso]] after he got expelled from the School of Fine Arts in Spain. His inspiration was shown in his paintings, such as this one.

'''Castrum doloris''' ([[Latin]] for ''castle of grief'') is a name for the structure and decorations sheltering or accompanying the [[catafalque]] or [[bier]] that signify the prestige or high estate of the deceased. A ''castrum doloris'' might feature an elaborate [[baldachin]] and would include [[candle]]s, possibly [[flower]]s, and in most cases [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], [[epitaph]]s and possibly [[allegorical]] [[statue]]s. Many extensive ''castra doloris'' can be traced to the customs of 17th century and 18th century or even earlier, since Pope Sixtus V's funeral arrangements included a ''castrum doloris'' in the late 16th Century.

Notable examples include [[coffin portrait]] ({{lang-pl|portret trumienny}}) of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8346">The '''''death of the novel''''' is the common name for the theoretical discussion of the declining importance of the [[novel]] as [[literary form]]. Many 20th century authors entered into the debate, often sharing their ideas in their own [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]] writings.

==History==

[[File:1877-winslow-homer-the-new-novel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Winslow Homer, "The New Novel", 1877]]

The [[novel]] was well-defined by the 19th century.  In the 20th century, however, many writers began to rebel against the traditional structures imposed by this form.  This reaction against the novel caused some literary theorists to question the relevancy of the novel and even to predict its 'death.'

Some of the earliest proponents of the "death of the novel" were [[José Ortega y Gasset]], who wrote his ''Decline of the Novel'' in 1925&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/grasset.htm |title=José Ortega y Gasset |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205144836/http://kirjasto.sci.fi/grasset.htm |archivedate=5 February 2007 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walter Benjamin]] in his 1930 review ''Krisis des Romans'' (Crisis of the Novel).&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.llc.ed.ac.uk/si1/sieg.html]: ''Döblin finds fault with the novel, since it focuses on individual characters or in its classic form of the Bildungsroman even recounts the education of the one protagonist. In his critique of the novel as genre, Döblin echoes considerations of both the literary discourse in Germany, which reflects on what has been called the 'crisis of narration', and the philosophical debate on the vanishing subject.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s, contributors to the discussion included [[Gore Vidal]], [[Roland Barthes]], and [[John Barth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Barth]], "[[The Literature of Exhaustion]]", ''[[The Atlantic]],'' 1967&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Sukenick]] wrote the story ''The Death of the Novel'' in 1969. In 1954, [[Wolfgang Kayser]] argued that the death of the narrator would lead to the death of the novel - a view that has since been contested by many people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidenreich|first1=Rosmarin|title=The Postwar Novel in Canada: Narrative Patterns and Reader Response|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|isbn=1554587018|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdDfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]] argued that the novel would be likely to atrophy and die as a literary form if it did not advance beyond 19th century structures; this admonition led to his creation of the New Novel or [[Nouveau roman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Delahoyde|first1=Dr. Michael|title=Robbe-Grillet, Jealousy|url=http://public.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/20th/robbe.html|website=Washington State University|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Wolfe]] in the 1970s predicted that the [[New Journalism]] would displace the novel. [[Italo Calvino]] is considered to have turned round the question "is the novel dead?", as "is it possible to tell stories that are not novels?"&lt;ref&gt;Eugenio Bolongaro, ''Italo Calvino and the Compass of Literature'' (2003), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Cybook Opus Bookeen.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]
As for causes, [[Robert B. Pippin]] connects the 'death of the novel' with the rise of [[nihilism]] in European culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethics.sandiego.edu/video/APA/Pacific/2001/Pippin/Robert%20Pippin,%20Response%20to%20Critics.html Robert Pippin, Response to Critics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Bellow]], discussing ''[[Ravelstein]]'' which was loosely a portrait of [[Allan Bloom]], commented on a connection to the idea that ''they are really saying that there are no significant people to write about''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/critics/reviews/0,5917,219810,00.html Ravelstein by Saul Bellow | Critics | Guardian Unlimited Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[David Foster Wallace]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptwi.com/~bobkat/observer1.html], ''[[The New York Observer]]'', October 13, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; connected the 'death of the novel' with the mortality of the post-war generation of American novelists.

[[Will Self]] discussed the idea of the death of the novel, as a microcosm of the wider debate about the death of the book itself, in relation to the transition from a [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]] era of printing to the post-Gutenberg era of the information age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Self|first1=Will|title=The novel is dead (this time it's for real)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/02/will-self-novel-dead-literary-fiction|website=The Observer|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has even questioned the longevity of the bookshelf, let alone the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Self|first1=Will|title=The death of the shelf|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/the-death-of-the-shelf/#.U6hl5qFLs6I|website=Prospect Magazine|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological change is often identified as a major possible cause. Anxieties about the disappearance of the book, as well as the novel, have been common throughout the [[20th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = E-readers and the death of the book: Or, new media and the myth of the disappearing medium|url = http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/05/18/1461444815586984|journal = New Media &amp; Society|date = 2015-05-18|issn = 1461-4448|pages = 1461444815586984|doi = 10.1177/1461444815586984|language = en|first = Andrea|last = Ballatore|first2 = Simone|last2 = Natale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Kannberg sees the post-Gutenberg age as being one where the entire morphology of literature may transform as a result of 'hyper-literacy' and the exponential abundance of texts. He argues that there may be a rebirth of the novel, or the birth of a descendant to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kannberg|first1=Henry|title=Hyper-Literacy in the Exponential Era|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/191379578/HYPER-LITERACY-IN-THE-EXPONENTIAL-EPOCH-hypelit|website=Scribd|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar observations were made by [[Marcus du Sautoy]] who argued that technology allows for changes to books and novel-writing that are only just beginning to be explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sautoy|first1=Marcus du|title=Liked the book? Try the app|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/03/marcus-du-sautoy-apps-books|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
Contemporary scholars such as [[Kathleen Fitzpatrick (American academic)|Kathleen Fitzpatrick]] argue that claims of the novel's death were highly exaggerated, and that such claims often reflect anxiety about changes in the twentieth-century media landscape, as well as more submerged anxieties about social changes within the United States itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anxietyofobsolescence.com ''The Anxiety of Obsolescence: The American Novel in the Age of Television''] (Vanderbilt UP, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Salman Rushdie]], the postwar notion of the 'death of the novel' is one that has tended to exhibit certain First World assumptions based on imperialistic nostalgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacKay|first1=Marina|title=The Cambridge Introduction to the Novel|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1139493574|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNOnJkxlr3IC&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A designer''' is a person who makes [[design]]s for objects. A [[fashion designer]] designs clothing, a [[web designer]] designs web pages, and an [[automobile design]]er designs automobiles. In each case, the designer works with the help of a technician or [[engineer]] who understands deeper level concepts of [[manufacturing]] and engineering, and the designer themself is largely confined to work at a surface level.   

More formally, a designer is an [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] that "specifies the structural properties of a design [[Object (philosophy)|object]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P. and Wand, Y. (2009). A proposal for a formal definition of the design concept. In Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., editors, Design Requirements Workshop (LNBIP 14), pp. 103–136. Springer-Verlag, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, anyone who creates tangible or intangible objects, products, processes, laws, games, graphics, services, and experiences is referred to as a designer.

==Overview==
Classically, the main area of design was only [[architecture]], which was understood as the major arts. The design of [[clothing]], [[furniture]], and other common artifacts were left mostly to tradition or artisans specializing in hand making them.

Design is a part of the [[Visual communication|communication arts]], [[design]] is something you plan to create, it communicates to the viewer or user a visual and emotional message to change or guide  through an emotional connection with a product or service enhancing their experience of the product or [[brand]]

With the increasing complexity in [[industrial design]] of today’s society, and due to the needs of [[mass production]] where more time is usually associated with more cost, the production methods became more complex and with them, the way designs and their production is created. The classical areas are now subdivided into smaller and more specialized domains of design (landscape design, urban design, exterior design, interior design, industrial design, furniture design, cloth design, and much more) according to the product designed or perhaps its means of production. Despite the variety of specializations within the design industry, all of them are very closely connected in terms of the need of professionals having a eye for design and being inspired by each other.

When designers speak of [[graphic design]] they speak of it in terms of simplifying complexity so users do not feel overwhelmed when faced with complex systems. More information can lead to a better, simpler solution to whatever problem the designer is trying to solve. Using [[research methodology]] to solve problems is one of the most important aspects of design, it enables the designer to properly assess the clients and audience needs. Part of a designer's job is to get to know the audience they intend on canvassing and what will be the placement of any produced material created.

The education, experience, and genetic blocks that form the base of a competent designer is normally similar no matter the area of specialization, only in a later stages of training and work will designer diverge to a specialized field. The methods of teaching or the program and theories followed vary according to schools and field of study.
Today, a design team, no matter the scale of the equipment, is usually composed by a master designer (the head of the team) that will have the responsibility to take decisions about the way the creative process should evolve, and a number of technical designers (the hands of the team) specialized in diverse areas according to the product proposed, depending on the type of design [[industrial design]] vs [[graphic design]] for example. For more complex products, the team will also be composed of professionals from other areas like engineers, advertising specialists, and others as required.
The relationships established between team members will vary according to proposed product, the processes of production, the equipment available, or the theories followed during the idea development, but normally they are not too restrictive, giving an opportunity to everyone in the team to take a part in the creation process or at least to express an idea.

[[File:Azerat chapelle charpente.JPG|thumb|The diagonal beams are dragon beams. Chapel of Our Lady of Good Hope, Azerat, France]]
'''Dragon beam''' is a horizontal, diagonal [[Beam (structure)|beam]] in the corner(s) of some traditional [[Timber framing|timber framed]] buildings. The term is commonly used in both [[hip roof]] framing and [[jettying]]. Older publications may use the synonyms dragging beam, dragging piece, dragging tie, dragon piece or dragon tie. Inconsistencies in modern usage are discussed below. In French it is called a coyer or enrayure.

==Etymology==
The etymology of dragon is unclear. The term may be descended from German [[:de:Träger|träger]] (a carrier), Danish [[:da:Gitterbro|dragere]] (bearing beam, joist, girder) or Dutch [[:nl:Bint (bouwkunde)|draagbalk]] (beam). The origin has also been proposed as a corruption of diagonal or diagon.&lt;ref&gt;Miles Lewis, "Puncheons and Dragons:Renaissance carpentry and semantics" http://www.mileslewis.net/lectures/04-history-of-building/puncheons-and-dragons.pdf accessed 3/22/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hip roofs==
The dragon beam lies parallel to and below a hip rafter and carries the rafter. The dragon beam is carried by the wall on the outer end and by a horizontal piece between the two walls on the inside end. There are conflicting usages for this term in the U.K. and U.S.A. (see below). The most common usage seems to be combination dragon beam/cross tie.

The '''Egyptian pavilion''' is a national pavilion of the Venice Biennale. It houses Egypt's official representation during the Biennale. The building is part of a complex that [[Brenno Del Giudice]] designed in 1932 to house Venetian decorative arts on [[Sant'Elena]] Island—an expansion of the Biennale from its main Giardini area. The building later served as Switzerland's national pavilion before the country moved to a new pavilion in 1952 and left the building to Egypt. The national pavilions for Serbia and Venice flank the Egyptian pavilion. Egypt's 1995 exhibition won the Biennale's Golden Lion award for best national pavilion.

== Building ==

In 1932, Italian architect [[Brenno Del Giudice]] designed a series of buildings on [[Sant'Elena]] as an expansion from the main [[Giardini]] area of the [[Venice Biennale]]. The island of Sant'Elena is separated from the Giardini by a bridged canal.{{sfn|Re Rebaudengo|2013|p=174}} The original complex was designed as a single unit to exhibit Venetian [[decorative arts]].{{sfn|Re Rebaudengo|2013|p=177}} Its façade repeats a pattern of straight and curved features,{{sfn|Re Rebaudengo|2013|p=177}} including multiple arches in its façade's recesses and openings.{{sfn|Re Rebaudengo|2013|p=174}} The complex was later split into two national pavilions flanking a central Venetian pavilion{{sfn|Re Rebaudengo|2013|p=177}} of which Switzerland received the national pavilion on the left.{{sfn|Re Rebaudengo|2013|p=175}} When Switzerland moved to a new pavilion in 1952,{{sfn|Re Rebaudengo|2013|p=183}} Egypt moved into the Del Giudice building, where it remains as of 2013.{{sfn|Re Rebaudengo|2013|p=175}} The space consists of a rectangular room with two smaller rooms adjacent. The building's entrance extends outwards from its façade, similar to the visual style of the Venetian pavilion next door.{{sfn|Re Rebaudengo|2013|p=175}} The letters "RAE" are carved into the façade above the entrance archway, for "Repubblica Araba d'Egitto".{{sfn|Stock|2015}}

Del Giudice expanded the complex in 1938 to add pavilions on each side of the main structure.{{sfn|Re Rebaudengo|2013|p=176}} Sweden used the building to the left of the Egyptian pavilion,{{sfn|Re Rebaudengo|2013|p=176}} but the Nordic countries constructed their own pavilion between 1958 and 1962,{{sfn|Re Rebaudengo|2013|p=190}} and Serbia received Sweden's old pavilion.{{sfn|Re Rebaudengo|2013|p=176}} The Egyptian pavilion rests between the Serbian and Venetian pavilions.{{sfn|Re Rebaudengo|2013|pp=162–3}}

== Exhibitions ==

Egypt and the [[United Arab Republic]] participated in the Venice Biennale since 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Di Martino |first1=Enzo |title=The history of the Venice Biennale: 1895-2005 |pages=126–7 |date=2005 |isbn=978-88-901104-4-3 |publisher=Papiro Arte |location=Venezia }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

=== 2011 ===

Digital artist Ahmed Basiony was killed on the [[Friday of Anger]] at the start of the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]].{{sfn|Ramadan|2015|p=76}} His friend, the artist Shady El Noshokaty, nominated Basiony to represent Egypt at the 2011 54th Venice Bienniale. Only months after Basiony's death, Egypt's Ministry of Culture selected the project. The curator Aida Eltorie, with El Noshokaty, showed one of Basiony's last works, ''30 Days of Running in the Space'', alongside documentary footage of the protests in Cairo shot by Basiony during the last three days of his life.{{sfn|Ramadan|2015|p=78}} ''30 Days'', which Basiony first performed in January 2010, consisted of Basiony jogging in a plastic suit whose physiological sensors sent data wirelessly to a computer, which visualized and projected the data on a wall. His performance, one hour each day of the 30-day show, was recorded.{{sfn|Ramadan|2015|pp=78–9}}

The animated changes in ''30 Days''{{'s}} visualization showed no observable correlation with Basiony's actions or state. An interpretation of the work posited that the work represented the futility of aimless activity, meticulous yet pointless.{{sfn|Ramadan|2015|p=79}}

Basiony's death and the Biennale exhibition brought eminence to the field of new media art and encouraged Egyptian new media artists. A version of the Biennale show was presented at the [[American University in Cairo]] in October 2012 as part of a commemoration of Basiony. A simultaneous retrospective of his new media work was displayed at [[Darb 1718]].{{sfn|Ramadan|2015|p=78}}

The Egyptian media artist Ahmed Bassiouny's exhibition at the 54th Venice Biennale in 2011 was openly polemical.{{sfn|Kholeif|2013}} ''Ahram Online'' described the 2011 exhibition as "renowned".{{sfn|Elsirgany|2015}}

''Ibraaz'' described the pavilion's 2013 exhibition of bronze, steel, and granite sculptures self-curated by [[Khaled Zaki]] was "laughable" in comparison to the previous year.{{sfn|Kholeif|2013}}

=== 2015 ===

In 2015, the three exhibitors won an Egyptian Ministry of Culture contest to represent Egypt in Venice. In "Can You See", an installation featured looping astroturf surfaces replete with tablet computers, which showed insects, pests, butterflies, and bunnies in grassy pastures.{{sfn|Droitcour|2015}} The astroturfed surfaces were built in white [[medium density fiberboard]] and formed ramps, precipices, and entranceways.{{sfn|Forbes|2015}} The structures could also resemble bridges.{{sfn|Elsirgany|2015}} When viewed from above, the structure spelled the word "PEACE" in both Latin and Arabic scripts,{{sfn|Forbes|2015}} though visitors cannot view this.{{sfn|Stock|2015}} The "PEACE" logo was also pasted on the astroturf. Viewers could point the cameras of the several Samsung tablets on stands throughout the room towards these logos to show an [[augmented reality]] within the gallery. The screen showed plus and minus symbols, which viewers could press to change the serenity of the scene. Several presses of the plus symbol brought digital bunnies, butterflies, and flowers on-screen, but several presses of the minus symbol brought cockroaches, tarantulas, and flames on-screen. The three artists and commissioner helped some visitors use the software. The room was lit in a light gray light and springtime ambient piped-in music played in the background.{{sfn|Forbes|2015}}

The Ministry of Culture selection committee was led by [[Helwan University]] fine arts dean El-Sayed Qandil. Other committee members came from the art community and included were artists, arts writers, and art academics. The committee chose three finalists from eleven graded submissions. The Supreme Council of Plastic Arts voted for the winner from the three finalists. The criteria by which the submissions were judged include: (1) teamwork, as the artists would represent Egypt together, (2) fit with the commissioner, who should have art and language experience, and (3) concept, which must match the themes of the Biennale, modernity, and "current direction of the country".{{sfn|Elsirgany|2015}} The three artists and commissioner all hold degrees from Helwan University's fine arts department, and listed few other exhibitions in their curriculum vitae.{{sfn|Stock|2015}}

The project received mixed reviews both in Egypt and abroad for both its artistic content and the Ministry's selection process. ''[[Ahram Online]]'' reported that the installation revealed a growing divide between independent and state-run projects in Egypt's art industry. Faten Mostafa of Cairo's Art Talks gallery thought that the concept was more "like an undergraduate project" than the standards of the Biennale. Shady El-Noshokaty, a contemporary artist and co-curator of the 2011 exhibition, claimed that claimed that the selection committee represented more traditional than contemporary arts, and that the result of the ministry selection process would reflect government priorities and "artificiality". The head of the selection committee defended its open call for participants. Another artist noted that some were upset about the selection even before the Biennale's opening.{{sfn|Elsirgany|2015}} Alexander Forbes of ''[[Artsy]]'' wrote that the exhibition was "definitely the weirdest in the Giardini—and quite possibly in Venice at large". He felt conflicted between what he described as the project's "visual cues of a ... lame corporate-sponsored 'art' show", the exhibit's earnest advocacy to opt for peace in light of the country's [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|recent revolution]]. His review, which described the tablet visual effects as "cute" and the exhibition as "cheesy" yet "surprisingly moving",{{sfn|Forbes|2015}} was widely shared on social media.{{sfn|Elsirgany|2015}} Forbes thought that the "amateurish nature" of the installation debased the high production values of the Biennale, and considered whether the work was the Ministry's own meta-commentary on the post-revolution's record of repressing freedom of expression.{{sfn|Forbes|2015}} Brian Droitcour of ''[[Art in America]]'' wrote that the installation's message of peace as a natural state was "trite", and that in the atmosphere of the Biennale "any throwback to a transcendent project comes off as hopelessly hokey".{{sfn|Droitcour|2015}} He called the "harmless wordplay and flashy gadgetry ... a safe choice for a bureaucracy aiming to promote quiescence" in the years following the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]].{{sfn|Droitcour|2015}} Alexandra Stock of ''Madr Masr'' wrote that the pavilion's aims were unclear, with inconsistent conceptual information between the exhibition's promotional materials, and that the tablet software was gimmicky and had issues with its programming. She wrote that the list of government agencies as curators of the exhibition was its "most mysterious element".{{sfn|Stock|2015}}

=== 2017 ===

Egyptian artist [[Moataz Nasr]] represented Egypt at the 57th Venice Biennale. His multi-channel video installation, "The Mountain", showed the life of a fictional Egyptian village over the cycle of a single day. The village's residents become suspicious over the course of the video, though the cause is concealed. Nasr wanted the video to express a poetic fearfulness. The video installation was buttressed by a background built from Egyptian dirt and bricks.{{sfn|Crow|2017}} Outside the pavilion, Egyptian artist Hassan Khan won the Biennale's Silver Lion for a Promising Young Artist for his multichannel music and text piece designed for a public park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Egyptian artist Hassan Khan wins Silver Lion of Venice Biennale |work=[[Ahram Online]] |date=2017-05-14 |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/25/268745/Arts--Culture/Visual-Art/Egyptian-artist-Hassan-Khan-wins-Silver-Lion-of-Ve.aspx |accessdate=2017-06-07 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/arts/anne-imhof-fierce-young-artist-and-choreographer-wins-venices-top-prize.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Enka'''|演歌}} is a popular [[Japan]]ese music genre considered to resemble traditional Japanese music stylistically. '''Modern enka''', however, is a relatively recent musical form, while adopting a more traditional musical style in its vocalism than ''[[ryūkōka]]'' music, popular during the [[World War II|prewar]] years.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Reiko Yano. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SnGY9XQj0ocC&amp;pg=PA42 Tears of Longing: Nostalgia and the Nation in Japanese Popular Song]''. ''[[Google Books]]''. via Harvard Univ Asia Center. 2003. 42. {{ISBN|978-0-674-01276-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern enka, as developed in the postwar era, is a form of [[Ballad#Sentimental ballads|sentimental ballad music]]. Some of the first modern enka singers were [[Hachiro Kasuga]], [[Michiya Mihashi]], and [[Hideo Murata]].&lt;ref name="ntv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntv.co.jp/omoii-tv/today/081022.html|title=The day that enka singer Hachiro Kasuga died|publisher=[[Nippon Television]]|date=2008-10-22|accessdate=2009-02-09|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revival of enka in its modern form is said to date from 1969, when [[Keiko Fuji]] made her debut. The most famous male enka singer is [[Kiyoshi Hikawa]].

==Etymology==
The term ''enka'' was first used to refer to political texts set to music which were sung and distributed by opposition activists belonging to the [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]]{{Clarify|date=August 2011}} during the [[Meiji period]] (1868–1912) as a means of bypassing government curbs on speeches of political dissent – and in this sense the word is derived from {{Nihongo|"''en''zetsu no uta"|演説の歌}}, meaning "speech song."

Another theory holds that modern enka means {{Nihongo|"''en''jiru uta"|演じる歌}}, meaning "performance song."&lt;ref name=keio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flet.keio.ac.jp/kifu/jasrac/class/20021021.html |title=Music and Contemporary Society |publisher=JASRAC contribution course in Keio University |date=2002-10-21 |accessdate=2009-01-18 |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050128212635/http://www.flet.keio.ac.jp/kifu/jasrac/class/20021021.html |archivedate=January 28, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Alex, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081118i1.html 'Enka' still strikes nostalgic nerve]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 18 November 2008, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre called ''enka'' is also said to be an expedient classification for record labels as well as [[J-pop]]. For example, [[Harumi Miyako]], who has been usually considered as an enka singer, said "I don't think that I sing 'enka'" and "In fact, there was no such term as 'enka' when I debuted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamakimasayuki.com/musica/bn_53.htm|script-title=ja:世界は演歌に満ちている|publisher=Masayuki Tamaki Official Website|date=2005-12-12|accessdate=2009-02-01|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=fn&gt;Original text: "わたし、自分が演歌をうたってるとは思ってませんから。"&lt;br /&gt;"じっさい、あたしがデビューしたころは、特に演歌なんて言い方はしなかったですよ。"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical style==
Modern enka's mainstream scale is called {{Nihongo4||ヨナ抜き短音階|Yonanuki Tan-Onkai}} or "Minor Scale without Four and Seven (''re'' and ''sol'')," and is a modified version of {{Nihongo4||ヨナ抜き長音階|Yonanuki Chō-Onkai}} or "Major Scale without Four and Seven (''Fa'' and ''Si'')," which came from an older Japanese scale, the {{Nihongo4|"[[Ryo scale|Ryo Scale]]"|呂音階|Ryo Onkai}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ntj.jac.go.jp/dglib/edc8/nattoku/nippon/rroin/yonanuki.html|title=Yonanuki Onkai|publisher=Japan Arts Council|accessdate=2009-02-23|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest Japanese songs that was said to have partly used it is [[Rentarō Taki]]'s "[[Kōjō no Tsuki]]," which was called {{Nihongo4||唱歌|shōka|"school song"}} in the [[Meiji period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atkyushu.com/InfoApp?LISTID=202&amp;SCD=m199706|script-title=ja:佐世保で生まれた日本初のワルツ｢美しき天然｣　～その１～|publisher=[[Kyushu Railway Company]]|date=June 1997|accessdate=2009-02-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020509171920/http://www.atkyushu.com/InfoApp?LISTID=202&amp;SCD=m199706|archivedate=2002-05-09|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hokudai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cat.hokudai.ac.jp/osawa/member/ujima/butai/song1.bak|title=Kōjō no tsuki|publisher=[[Hokkaido University]]|accessdate=2009-02-23|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seventh- [[degree (music)|scale degree]] is not used in "Kōjō no Tsuki", a song of [[B minor]].&lt;ref name="hokudai" /&gt;

The music, based on the [[pentatonic scale]], has some resemblance to [[blues]].&lt;ref name="japantimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081118i1.html|title=Enka still strikes nostalgic nerve|publisher=The Japan Times|date=2008-11-18|accessdate=2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enka lyrics are usually written similarly around the themes of love and loss, loneliness, enduring hardships, and persevering in the face of difficulties, even suicide or death. Although enka is a genre of ''[[kayōkyoku]]'', it is considered to be more expressive and emotional, though there is no clear consensus on the matter.&lt;ref name=keio /&gt;&lt;ref name="maekawa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nishinippon.co.jp/nnp/culture/kayou/20061213/20061213_001.shtml|script-title=ja:第６部・演歌巡礼＜２＞前川清　べたつかぬ距離感で歌う|publisher=[[Nishinippon Shimbun]]|date=2006-12-13|accessdate=2009-05-05|language=ja|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206205342/http://www.nishinippon.co.jp/nnp/culture/kayou/20061213/20061213_001.shtml|archivedate=2009-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archetypal enka singers employ a style of [[melisma]]—where a single syllable of text is sung while moving between several different notes in succession—known as ''kobushi''.&lt;ref name="japantimes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isis.ne.jp/mnn/senya/senya0201.html|title=松岡正剛の千夜千冊『J－POP進化論』佐藤良明|publisher=Matsuoka Seigo no Senya Sensatsu|date=2000-12-28|accessdate=2010-04-23|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kobushi'' occurs when the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of the singer's voice fluctuates irregularly within one [[degree (music)|scale degree]]: This compares with [[vibrato]], which vibrates in a regular cycle.&lt;ref name="kobushi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://r25.jp/b/honshi/a/link_review_details/id/1122008052308 |script-title=ja:俗にいう演歌の「こぶし」って一体ナニ？ |publisher=R25.jp |date=2008-05-23 |accessdate=2009-04-11 |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202083429/http://r25.jp/b/honshi/a/link_review_details/id/1122008052308 |archivedate=2009-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kobushi'' technique is not limited to enka, as can be heard in the Italian song "[[Santa Lucia]]."&lt;ref name="kobushi" /&gt; In the late 1930s and early '40s, the music of composer [[Masao Koga]] began to resemble Buddhist ''[[shomyo]]''-chanting possibly because his [[record label]] asked him to produce music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jade.dti.ne.jp/~onodera/kanagawa.html|script-title=ja:古賀政男生誕百年「はなまつりコンサート」|publisher=Yumi Aikawa Official Website|accessdate=2009-05-18|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Koga became a composer whose work is considered seminal to the creation of the genre, present-day enka is different from Koga's primary music because the singing styles of many postwar singers were different from the ''kobushi'' of Koga's musical note.&lt;ref name="koga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nishinippon.co.jp/nnp/culture/kayou/20061219/20061219_001.shtml|script-title=ja:第６部・演歌巡礼＜７＞古賀政男　日本的歌唱を熟知し作曲|publisher=Nishinippon Shimbun|date=2006-12-19|accessdate=2009-02-02|language=ja|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207014451/http://www.nishinippon.co.jp/nnp/culture/kayou/20061219/20061219_001.shtml|archivedate=2009-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern enka singer [[Takeshi Kitayama]] himself admitted in 2006, "I was even confused because [Koga's] musical note was different from that of an old singer."&lt;ref name="koga" /&gt;&lt;ref group=fn&gt;Original text: "昔の人が歌った音資料と楽譜が違って戸惑いもしました"&lt;/ref&gt;

Enka suggests a traditional, idealized, or romanticized aspect of Japanese culture and attitudes. Enka singers, predominantly women, usually perform in a [[kimono]] or in evening dress. Male enka performers tend to wear formal dress, or in some performances, traditional Japanese attire. Nods to traditional Japanese music are common in enka. The melodies of enka are fundamentally Western harmonies, and electronic instruments are used, such as synthesizers and electric lead guitar with plenty of distortion, but its musical instruments also include traditional Japanese instruments such as the ''[[shakuhachi]]'' and the ''[[shamisen]].''&lt;ref&gt;Roberson, James E. and Suzuki, Nobue.

==History==

===19th century–1920s: ''Sōshi'' enka and violin enka===
[[Image:Azenbo Soeda.jpg|thumb|right|[[Azenbo Soeda]], enka-shi in the [[Meiji Period]]]]
The political songs called ''enka'' in the Meiji period (1868–1912) are also called {{Nihongo|''Sōshi Enka''|壮士演歌}} to distinguish it from modern enka. Street singers were called {{Nihongo|enka-shi|演歌師}}. The first enka song is said to be {{Nihongo|"[[Dynamite bushi]]"|ダイナマイト節}}.{{why?|date=November 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.um.u-tokyo.ac.jp/publish_db/1999news/04/406/0406.html|script-title=ja:明治の声の文化|publisher=[[University of Tokyo]]|accessdate=2009-02-19|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; The songs during this time include [[Otojiro Kawakami]]'s "Oppekepe Bushi."{{why?|date=December 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Downer.

P-53. {{ISBN|978-1-59240-050-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Taishō period]] (1912–26), enka-shi began to incorporate the [[violin]], thus their songs were called ''violin enka.'' An enka-shi of the period was {{Nihongo|Toshio Sakurai|桜井敏雄}}, who in turn taught [[Haruo Oka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosenet.ne.jp/~matsuo-e/prize_4.html |script-title=ja:第４回松尾芸能賞受賞者一覧 |publisher=Matsuo Entertainment Development Foundation |accessdate=2009-02-23 |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416035739/http://www.rosenet.ne.jp/~matsuo-e/prize_4.html |archivedate=2009-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In present-day Japan, Road Traffic Law regulates the appearance of street performers. However, Japanese performers such as {{Nihongo|Utaji Fukuoka|福岡詩二}} have still sung enka from the Taishō period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/3265500/ |script-title=ja:日本の伝統・大道芸は妙技だ。街に復活せよ！　＝東京・浅草（下） |publisher=livedoor |date=2007-08-11 |accessdate=2009-02-21 |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112204630/http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/3265500/ |archivedate=2007-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|1995 earthquake]] struck, Soul Flower Mononoke Summit, a musical project of the rock band [[Soul Flower Union]], played ''sōshi enka'' to help buoy the spirits of disaster victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20060929a1.html|title=Street spirits plug in and out|publisher=The Japan Times|date=2006-09-29|accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s–1940s: Era of ''ryūkōka''===

{{Main|Ryūkōka}}
In the early [[Shōwa period]] in the late '20s, record companies produced ''[[ryūkōka]]'' in place of street performers (''enka-shi'').{{?|month=November 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.janjan.jp/column/0603/0603220226/1.php |script-title=ja:昭和流行歌の幕開け《波浮の港》 |author=Kiyomaro Kikuchi |publisher=[[JANJAN]] |date=2006-03-23 |accessdate=2009-01-16 |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110184316/http://www.news.janjan.jp/column/0603/0603220226/1.php |archivedate=2007-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enka-shi began to use [[guitar]] and were dubbed {{Nihongo|''nagashi''|流し}}.&lt;ref name=keio /&gt; [[Haruo Oka]] debuted with the 1939 song {{Nihongo|"Kokkyō no Haru"|国境の春|lit.

===Late 1940s–1954: The arrival of new singers===
{{See also|Japanese jazz}}
As [[jazz]] became popular in early postwar Japan, Japanese singer [[Hibari Misora]] released her debut song "Kappa [[boogie-woogie]]" on [[Nippon Columbia]] in 1949 at the age of only 12. She went on to sing jazz songs throughout the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009OLPF6|title=Jazz &amp; Standard Complete Collection 1955-66|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later did many enka songs in the 60s and 70s.

In 1948, [[Hachiro Kasuga]] won King Records' first talent contest. He joined the record label the next year where [[Haruo Oka]] was his senior. His debut single {{Nihongo|"Akai Lamp no Shū Ressha"|赤いランプの終列車|lit. "Last Train with Red Lamp"}} was released in 1952. The [[Kabuki]]-style song {{Nihongo|"Otomi-san"|お富さん|lit. "Miss Otomi"}} was originally made for Oka, but was sung by Kasuga, and in 1954, "Otomi-san" became a very popular hit in Japan.&lt;ref name="kabuki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.janjan.jp/column/0702/0702130008/1.php|script-title=ja:歌舞伎ソング・《お富さん》のブーム|publisher=[[JANJAN]]|date=2007-02-15|accessdate=2009-02-09|language=ja|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504210600/http://www.news.janjan.jp/column/0702/0702130008/1.php|archivedate=2010-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasuga took part in the [[NHK]] ''[[Kōhaku Uta Gassen]]'' for the first time with "Otomi-san" that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.town.aizubange.fukushima.jp/Members/syoukoukankou/contents/guide/kankou/kasugalife.html|title=Hachiro Kasuga Profile|publisher=[[Aizubange, Fukushima]]|accessdate=2009-02-12|language=ja|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120917235305/http://www.town.aizubange.fukushima.jp/Members/syoukoukankou/contents/guide/kankou/kasugalife.html|archivedate=2012-09-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song's composer, Masanobu Tokuchi, was born on [[Okinawa Island]] and grew up in [[Amami Ōshima|Amami]] and became an important figure for introducing the [[Ryukyu Islands]]' music into the Japanese mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breast.co.jp/soulflower/library/disc/detail/sf-070.html|title=Deracine Ching-dong|publisher=[[Soul Flower Union]] Official Website|accessdate=2009-05-06|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1955–1959: Early history of modern enka===

Although "Otomi-san" was popular, [[Hachiro Kasuga|Kasuga]] himself was not completely satisfied with it and recorded the song {{Nihongo|"Wakare no Ippon-sugi"|別れの一本杉|lit. "Farewell One Cedar"}} by [[Toru Funamura]].&lt;ref name="ntv" /&gt; The song was released in 1955 and was later regarded as a true enka song.{{why?|month=November 2010|date=November 2010}}&lt;ref name="funamura"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanspo.com/geino/top/gt200305/gt2003051808.html|script-title=ja:船村徹さん、演歌を愛し歌い続けて５０年|publisher=Sanspo|date=2003-05-18|accessdate=2009-05-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030622011048/http://www.sanspo.com/geino/top/gt200305/gt2003051808.html|archivedate=2003-06-22|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song, ironically, was also influenced by [[tango music]]'s rhythm because Funamura felt that tango seemed similar to enka in its local color.&lt;ref name="funamura" /&gt; "Wakare no Ippon-sugi" was later covered by singers as diverse as [[Michiya Mihashi]], [[Hideo Murata]], [[Keiko Fuji]], [[Hibari Misora]], [[Saburō Kitajima]], [[Takashi Hosokawa]], and [[Hiroshi Itsuki]].{{when|date=December 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmv.co.jp/product/detail.asp?sku=1228316|script-title=ja:別れの一本杉は枯れず|publisher=HMV Japan|accessdate=2009-03-02|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasuga was later called the first enka singer.{{why?|month=November 2010|date=November 2010}}&lt;ref name="ntv" /&gt;

Around the postwar period, ''[[rōkyoku]]'' (or ''naniwa-bushi''), famous during the war, declined in popularity mainly because their speaking lengths were considered too long. Enka, on the other hand, which became popular around that time, was said to be a shortened version of ''rōkyoku'' because several enka singers such as Hideo Murata and [[Haruo Minami]] were originally ''rōkyoku'' singers and enka has many themes in common with the genre.&lt;ref name="nishinippon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nishinippon.co.jp/nnp/culture/kayou/20061220/20061220_001.shtml|script-title=ja:第６部・演歌巡礼＜８＞初代桃中軒雲右衛門　受け継がれゆく浪花節|publisher=Nishinippon Shimbun|date=2006-12-20|accessdate=2009-02-02|language=ja|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207014456/http://www.nishinippon.co.jp/nnp/culture/kayou/20061220/20061220_001.shtml|archivedate=2009-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable ''rōkyoku'' singer who had an influence on enka was [[Kumoemon Tochuken]], whose student's pupil was Murata.&lt;ref name="nishinippon" /&gt; Minami debuted on [[Teichiku Records]] in 1957 and Murata on Nippon Columbia in 1958.

Young enka singer [[Yukio Hashi]] appeared in 1960, [[Saburō Kitajima]] in 1962 and [[Harumi Miyako]] in 1964. [[Sachiko Kobayashi]] debuted with the 1964 single {{Nihongo|"Usotsuki Kamome"|ウソツキ鴎|lit. "Liar Seagull"}} at the age of only 10. The most well-known and beloved performer of enka is [[Hibari Misora]] (1937&amp;ndash;1989), known as the "Queen of Enka" and "Queen of Shōwa" for the period in which she lived and was celebrated. Misora's song "Yawara," composed by Masao Koga, won the grand prix award at the 1965 [[Japan Record Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jacompa.or.jp/rekishi/d1965.htm |title=7th Japan Record Awards |publisher=[[Japan Composer's Association]] |accessdate=2009-02-12 |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506061145/http://www.jacompa.or.jp/rekishi/d1965.htm |archivedate=2010-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Masaru Matsuyama also made his debut in 1965, but was not able to achieve commercial success and changed his stage name to [[Hiroshi Itsuki]] in 1971.

[[Mina Aoe]] appeared with the single {{Nihongo|"Kōkotsu no Blues"|恍惚のブルース|lit. "Ecstasy Blues"}} in 1966, pioneering the "enka-[[blues]]" genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nikkansports.com/jinji/2000/seikyo000704.html |script-title=ja:訃報・青江三奈さん |publisher=Nikkan Sports |date=2000-07-04 |accessdate=2009-09-14 |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606005736/http://www.nikkansports.com/jinji/2000/seikyo000704.html |archivedate=2008-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shinichi Mori]] debuted with the 1966 single {{Nihongo|"Onna no Tameiki"|女のためいき|lit.

"Port Town Blues"}} topped the Japanese [[Oricon]] single charts for five weeks and sold over one million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umeshunkyo.or.jp/204/263/data.html|title=Minatomachi Blues|publisher=Japan Dredging Reclamation Engineering Association|date=September 2008|accessdate=2009-10-02|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keiko Fuji]] came out with the 1969 single {{Nihongo|"Shinjuku no Onna"|新宿の女|lit. "Woman in Shinjuku"}} at the age of 18. The term ''enka'' which had not been used in the postwar era, was revived by her performance.&lt;ref name=keio /&gt;

===1970s: Maintaining popularity===
[[Keiko Fuji]]'s 1970 song "[[Keiko no Yume wa Yoru Hiraku]]" won the mass popularity award of the [[12th Japan Record Awards]] and the grand prix award of the first [[Japan Music Awards]]. That year, she also took part in the 21st [[Kōhaku Uta Gassen]] with the song. Her 1970 album {{Nihongo|''Shinjuku no Onna/'Enka no Hoshi' Fuji Keiko no Subete''|新宿の女/"演歌の星" 藤圭子のすべて|Woman in Shinjuku/'Star of Enka' All of Keiko Fuji}} established a record-breaking consecutive number-one record to top the [[Oricon]] charts for 20 "consecutive" weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/komimi/TKY200709190117.html|script-title=ja:オリコンのアルバム１位が千作品に　最多はユーミン|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|date=2007-09-19|accessdate=2009-01-27|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a record that still stands.

The best-selling enka after the Oricon charts began in 1968 is [[Shiro Miya]] and Pinkara Trio's 1972 "[[Onna no Michi]]." The song topped the Japanese Oricon single charts for 16 consecutive weeks and sold over 3.25 million copies, to become the second best-selling single in Japan behind "[[Oyoge! Taiyaki-kun]]."

[[Hiroshi Itsuki]]'s song "Yozora" won the grand prix award at the [[15th Japan Record Awards]] in 1973. [[Shinichi Mori]] released the single "Erimo Misaki"{{?|month=November 2010}} in 1974. Although the song was composed by non-enka musician [[Takuro Yoshida]], "Erimo Misaki" won the grand prix at the [[16th Japan Record Awards]] that year. [[Harumi Miyako]]'s song "[[Kita no Yadokara|Kita no Yado kara]]"{{?|month=November 2010}} also won the grand prix at the [[18th Japan Record Awards]] in 1976. New enka singers, who debuted in the '70s, include [[Sayuri Ishikawa]] and [[Takashi Hosokawa]] who were both [[Michiya Mihashi]]'s pupils.&lt;ref name="goo" /&gt;

Masao Koga died in 1978, after a career of composing about 5,000 songs.&lt;ref name="koga" /&gt; Toru Funamura became self-employed in 1978, beginning live performances and returning to the original position{{?|month=November 2010}} for his old friend Kimio Takano.&lt;ref name="funamura" /&gt; Keiko Fuji announced her retirement in 1979 and went to the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsutaya.co.jp/item/artist/view_a_A006096.html|title=Keiko Fuji|publisher=Tsutaya|accessdate=2009-05-06|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; where bizarrely enough, in 2006, the $400,000 she was carrying in cash was confiscated by the DEA. She denied any wrongdoing and in 2008 was cleared of all charges and the money returned to her.

===1980s: Losing definition===
[[Image:Stele Yagiri no watashi Takashi Hosokawa.jpg|thumb|left|The 1984 monument of Naomi Chiaki's song covered by Takashi Hosokawa "Yagiri no Watashi" at [[Matsudo, Chiba|Matsudo City]]]]
[[Takashi Hosokawa]]'s song "Kita Sakaba" won the grand prix at the [[24th Japan Record Awards]] in 1982. He covered [[Naomi Chiaki]]'s originally song "Yagiri no Watashi" next year. It was also won the grand prix at the [[25th Japan Record Awards|following Japan Record Awards]]. The total sales of [[Michiya Mihashi]]'s work surpassed 100 million records in 1983, making him the first artist to achieve that in Japan.&lt;ref name="goo" /&gt;

On June 11, 1986, [[Sanae Jōnouchi]], a member of [[Japanese idol|idol]] group [[Onyanko Club]], released the enka single "Ajisai Bashi," written by [[Yasushi Akimoto]]. The single debuted at No. 1 on the Oricon weekly single charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/ranking/4743/|script-title=ja:12年ぶりの記録を打ち立てた女性…|publisher=Oricon|date=2005-04-12|accessdate=2010-04-29|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ikuzo Yoshi]]'s 1986 single "Yukiguni" became the Oricon's 300th number-one single in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/special/070221_01.html|script-title=ja:ランキング特集『オリコン首位獲得シングル1000曲（1968～2007）』|publisher=Oricon|date=2007-02-21|accessdate=2009-05-04|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other new enka singers around that time included [[Fuyumi Sakamoto]] and [[Ayako Fuji]]. [[Hibari Misora]], at the age of 50, released the single "Midaregami" on December 10, 1987. "Midaregami" reached the No. 9 position on the Oricon weekly charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/release/d/32022/2/|title=Midaregami|publisher=Oricon|accessdate=2009-05-16|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yasushi Akimoto wrote the lyrics of her 1989 single "[[Kawa no Nagare no Yō ni]]". However, she died in 1989 and the enka range expanded into the genre ''[[kayōkyoku]]'' while the genre ''kayōkyoku'' was vanishing.&lt;ref name="maekawa" /&gt;

===1990s: Decline===
[[Hachiro Kasuga]] died in 1991. As enka's traditional themes were no longer appreciated among younger Japanese and Western-style [[J-pop]] music became more popular, enka sales declined.  However, the genre still had many adherents. Besides TV programs, enka could be heard in many restaurants, drinking establishments, [[karaoke]] bars and cafes. On the other hand, "bright" enka singer [[Yoshimi Tendo]], who was ignored when the "dark" enka songs like Keiko Fuji's song "Keiko no Yume wa Yoru Hiraku" were popular, took part in the [[Kōhaku Uta Gassen]] for the first time in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkansports.com/ns/entertainment/interview/2004/sun041226.html|title=Yoshimi Tendo|publisher=Nikkan Sports|date=2004-12-26|accessdate=2009-05-21|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other new enka singers such as Toshimi Tagawa and Fuyumi Sakamoto were also appearing on TV enka programs which kept enka alive. Taiwanese diva [[Teresa Teng]] was also singing in Japanese and covering enka songs from the 70s until she died in 1995 at the age of 42.

===2000s: Musical hybridity===
Enka's popularity among younger Japanese, however, increased in the first decade of the 21st century. [[Kiyoshi Hikawa]] debuted on [[Nippon Columbia]] in 2000 with the single "Hakone Hachiri no Hanjirō," which became a smash hit. The early solo releases of then-[[Morning Musume]] member [[Yuko Nakazawa]] were also enka. In contrast, [[Nana Mizuki]], who learned enka as a child, became a voice actress and also appeared as a singer on [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trendy.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/column/20081203/1021527/|script-title=ja:才色兼備の声優シンガーはオリコン2位！アニメ界を牽引する水樹奈々を直撃！|publisher=[[Nikkei Business Publications]]|date=2008-12-10|accessdate=2009-02-16|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 25, 2004, [[Johnny &amp; Associates]]' group [[Kanjani Eight]] debuted with the Kansai-limited release of "Naniwa Iroha Bushi" under the [[Teichiku Records]]. The song was based on "[[Kawachi ondo]]" and featured [[rapping|rap]]. The song was a hit and reached No. 8 on the Oricon weekly singles chart on the strength of Kansai sales alone. Then, on September 22, 2004, "Naniwa Iroha Bushi" was released nationwide and re-debuted on the Oricon weekly singles charts at the No. 1 spot, becoming the first enka single to reach the No. 1 in seventeen years since [[Yujiro Ishihara]]'s 1987 single "Kita no Tabibito" according to Oricon.

Hikawa also released the single "Hatsukoi Ressha" on February 9, 2005, which debuted at the No. 1 position on the Oricon charts, Hikawa's first number-one single on the Oricon weekly charts. Older female singer [[Junko Akimoto]] also debuted on King Records, releasing her first single "Madison-gun no Koi" on July 21, 2005. However,{{?|month=November 2010}} her musical style was '70s ''kayōkyoku'' style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trendy.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/special/20080807/1017494/?ST=yahoo_headlines&amp;P=2|script-title=ja:運命的な出会いから生まれたデビュー曲|publisher=[[Nikkei Business Publications]]|date=2008-08-11|accessdate=2009-05-05|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Veteran enka singer [[Hiroshi Itsuki]], at 58, released the single "Takasebune" on April 19, 2006 becoming his first Top 10 single in 22 years since 1984's "Nagaragawa Enka." It debuted at the number-nine position on the Oricon charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/entertainment/music/news/20060511et01.htm|script-title=ja:五木ひろしの新曲「高瀬舟」　オリコン初登場９位|publisher=Yomiuri Shimbun|date=2006-05-11|accessdate=2009-05-04|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hikawa's song "Ikken" won the grand prix at the [[48th Japan Record Awards]] on December 30, 2006. Kanjani Eight was transferred to the pop/rock record label Imperial Records, the sub-label of [[Teichiku Records]] in 2007. In the same year, 80s superstar [[Akina Nakamori]] paid her respect to enka music by releasing an album—full of light enka songs.

Junko Akimoto released the single "Ai no Mama de…" on January 23, 2008, reaching the top of the Oricon weekly single charts in January 2009, making her, at the age of 61, the oldest solo singer to top the charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-01-25/bleach-9th-major-5th-singles-debut-at-no.2-no.10|title=Bleach's, Major's Opening Singles Debut at #2, #10|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2009-01-25|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Hikawa released two consecutive number-one singles — "Ryōkyoku Ichidai" and "Tokimeki no Rumba" — on the Oricon weekly charts. [[Fuyumi Sakamoto]]'s 2009 song "Asia no Kaizoku", composed by [[Ayumi Nakamura (singer)|Ayumi Nakamura]], was an enka song featuring [[rock music]].&lt;ref name="asianokaizoku"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/entertainment/music/news/20090122et01.htm|script-title=ja:坂本冬美、中村あゆみが作詞・作曲の新曲「アジアの海賊」発売|publisher=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]|date=2009-01-22|accessdate=2010-01-07|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakamoto said, "If Ayumi sings the song, it's a rock song. If I sing the song, however, it's an enka song."&lt;ref name="asianokaizoku" /&gt;&lt;ref group=fn&gt;Original text: "この曲もあゆみさんが歌ったらロックなのに、私が歌ったら、演歌になる"&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
On January 1, 2010, 73-year-old [[Saburō Kitajima]] released the single {{Nihongo|"Fūfu Isshō"|夫婦一生|lit. "Couple in a Lifetime"}}, emerging at No. 10 on the Oricon weekly charts, making him the first solo artist to reach the Top 10 in his 70s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/rankmusic/72343/full/|title=北島三郎「73歳3か月」で最年長TOP10入り、19年ぶりに歴代記録抜く|publisher=Oricon|date=2010-01-12|accessdate=2010-01-12|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Fuyumi Sakamoto]] appeared on [[Masahiro Nakai]]'s TV program ''Nakai Masahiro no Kinyōbi no Sumatachi e'' on March 19, 2010, her double A-side single "Mata Kimi ni Koi Shiteru/Asia no Kaizoku" reached the Top 10 for the first time, ranked at No. 9 on the Oricon charts. The single became her first Top 10 single in 21 years since "Otoko no Jōwa," which had ranked in the Top 10 on the Oricon charts in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/rankmusic/74558/full/|title=『金スマ』効果！ 坂本冬美のシングルが49週目で21年ぶりTOP10入り|publisher=Oricon|date=2010-03-23|accessdate=2010-03-23|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nishioyuki-2013kashiwa.jpg|thumb|Enka singer [[Yuki Nishio]] performing in front of a music shop in [[Chiba prefecture|Chiba, Japan]].]]

==International popularity==
Enka has had a strong influence on music in Taiwan, which was once a [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese colony]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ith.sinica.edu.tw/quarterly_03-en.php?DB_Qua_MagID=81 Pei-feng Chen, "Images of Multi-colonial Taiwan in Three Types of Enka: Self-reconstruction through Highlighting Differences in Similarities,"] Taiwan Historical Research, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 
The first non-Japanese singer of enka was [[Sarbjit Singh Chadha]] from [[India]]. His enka album was released in 1975 and became a success in Japan, selling 150,000 copies. He went back to India a few years later, but returned to Japan in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unsung Indian, this Singh is king in Japan|publisher=DNA India|date=October 8, 2008|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1196400|accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Yolanda Tasico]] became the first [[Filipino people|Filipino]] enka singer, going to [[Japan]] with his singles "Shiawase ni Naroo," "Nagai Aida," and many others.

In the United States, while enka remains popular among a section of the (typically older) [[Japanese-American]] population, enka has many fans among non-Japanese.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} There are some enka orchestras and performers active in the country, such as the San Jose Chidori Band, which occasionally performs at [[O-Bon]] festivals in the summer.

'''''Execution''''' is a 1995 painting by [[Chinese art|Chinese]] artist [[Yue Minjun]].

Chinese painting sets sales record at London auction. Retrieved Oct 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Yue Minjun painted ''Execution'' in 1995 in a month.  He sold the painting to [[Hong Kong]] art dealer Manfred Schoeni for $5,000.&lt;ref name="cnn1" /&gt; Trevor Simon, investment banker, stumbled across the painting in 1996 in the back of a Hong Kong gallery.  He convinced Schoeni to sell the piece for [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]250,000 / [[United States dollar|US$]]32,200.  The painting was then shipped from Hong Kong to London, where Simon stored it in a warehouse.  Under the terms, the painting was to remain out of sight for five years in a warehouse.&lt;ref name="cnn2" /&gt;

In 2007, ''Execution'' became the most expensive work of Chinese contemporary art, selling for [[Pound sterling|£]]2.9 million / [[United States dollar|US$]]5.9 million / [[Euro|€]]4.2 million at London's [[Sotheby's]].&lt;ref name="cnn1" /&gt;  The art piece was billed by Sotheby's as "Among the most historically important paintings of the Chinese avant-garde ever to appear at auction."&lt;ref name="cnn1" /&gt;  Simon called Yue a brave man for painting something so seemingly politically dangerous.&lt;ref name="cnn2" /&gt;

The artist, Yue, denies that his paintings are a veiled criticism of his [[Government of the People's Republic of China|government]] or of Chinese society, and he does not believe his work will bring him trouble.&lt;ref name="cnn1" /&gt; 

{{quote|I want the audience not to think of one thing or one place or one event.  The whole world's the background.  As I said, the viewer should not link this painting to Tiananmen.  But Tiananmen is the catalyst for conceiving of this painting.&lt;ref name="cnn1" /&gt;}}

The painting has been compared to Goya's ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'' and Manet's ''[[The Execution of Emperor Maximilian]]''.&lt;ref name="cnn1" /&gt;

The term '''''formalism''''' describes an emphasis on form over content or meaning in the [[arts]], [[literature]], or [[philosophy]]. A practitioner of formalism is called a '''''formalist'''''.  A formalist, with respect to some discipline, holds that there is no transcendent meaning to that discipline other than the literal content created by a practitioner.  For example, formalists within [[mathematics]] claim that mathematics is no more than the symbols written down by the mathematician, which is based on logic and a few elementary rules alone.  This is as opposed to non-formalists, within that field, who hold that there are some things inherently true, and are not, necessarily, dependent on the symbols within mathematics so much as a greater truth.  Formalists within a discipline are completely concerned with "the rules of the game," as there is no other external truth that can be achieved beyond those given rules.  In this sense, formalism lends itself well to disciplines based upon [[axiomatic system]]s.

==Religion==
Formalism in religion means an emphasis on [[ritual]] and [[religious observance|observance]] over their meanings.  Within Christianity, the term [[Legalism (theology)|legalism]] is a derogatory term that is loosely synonymous to religious formalism.

==Law==
{{Main|Legal formalism}}
Formalism is a school of thought in law and [[jurisprudence]] which assumes that the law is a system of rules that can determine the outcome of any case, without reference to external norms.  For example, formalism animates the commonly heard criticism that "judges should apply the law, not make it."  To formalism's rival, legal realism, this criticism is incoherent, because legal realism assumes that, at least in difficult cases, all applications of the law will require that a judge refer to external (i.e. non-legal) sources, such as the judge's conception of justice, or commercial norms.

==Criticism==
In general in the study of the arts and literature, ''formalism'' refers to the style of criticism that focuses on artistic or literary techniques in themselves, in separation from the work's social and historical context. 

===Art criticism===
{{Main|formalism (art)}}

Generally speaking, formalism is the concept which everything necessary in a work of art is contained within it.  The context for the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, is not considered to be significant.  Examples of formalist aestheticians are [[Clive Bell]], [[Jerome Stolnitz]], and [[Edward Bullough]].

===Literary criticism===
{{Main|formalism (literature)}}

In contemporary discussions of [[literary theory]], the school of criticism of [[I. A. Richards]] and his followers, traditionally the [[New Criticism]],  has sometimes been labelled 'formalist'. The formalist approach, in this sense, is a continuation of aspects of classical [[rhetoric]]. 

[[Russian formalism]] was a twentieth century school, based in Eastern Europe, with roots in linguistic studies and also theorising on [[fairy tale]]s, in which content is taken as secondary since the tale 'is' the form, the princess 'is' the fairy-tale princess.

==The arts&lt;!--Linked from 'Theory of art'--&gt;==
===Poetry===
In modern poetry, ''Formalist poets'' may be considered as the opposite of writers of [[free verse]]. These are only labels, and rarely sum up matters satisfactorily. 'Formalism' in poetry represents an attachment to poetry that recognises and uses schemes of rhyme and rhythm to create poetic effects and to innovate. To distinguish it from archaic poetry the term 'neo-formalist' is sometimes used.

See for example:
*''[[The Formalist]]'', a literary magazine (now defunct) for formalist poetry
*[[New Formalism]], a movement within the [[poetry of the United States]].

===Film===
{{Main| Formalist film theory}}
In [[film studies]], formalism is a trait in filmmaking, which overtly uses the language of film, such as [[editing]], shot [[composition (visual arts)|composition]], camera movement, set design, etc., so as to emphasise [[graphical]] (as opposed to [[diegetic]]) qualities of the image.  Strict formalism, condemned by [[Realism (arts)|realist]] film theorists such as [[André Bazin]], has declined substantially in popular usage since the 1950s, though some more postmodern filmmakers reference it to suggest the artificiality of the film experience. 

Examples of formalist films may include Resnais's ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]'' and [[Sergei Parajanov|Parajanov]]'s ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Intellectual method==
Formalism can be applied to a set of notations and rules for manipulating them which yield results in agreement with experiment or other techniques of calculation.  These rules and notations may or may not have a corresponding mathematical semantics. In the case no mathematical semantics exists, the calculations are often said to be ''purely formal''. See for example [[scientific formalism]].

==Mathematics==
{{Main|Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)}}

In the [[foundations of mathematics]], formalism is associated with a certain rigorous mathematical method: see [[formal system]]. In common usage, ''a'' formalism means the out-turn of the effort towards formalisation of a given limited area. In other words, matters can be formally discussed once captured in a formal system, or commonly enough within something ''formalisable'' with claims to be one. Complete formalisation is in the domain of [[computer science]].

Formalism also more precisely refers to a certain school in the [[philosophy of mathematics]], stressing [[axiom]]atic proofs through [[theorem]]s, specifically associated with [[David Hilbert]]. In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], therefore, a formalist is a person who belongs to the school of formalism, which is a certain mathematical-philosophical doctrine descending from Hilbert.

==Anthropology==
In [[economic anthropology]], formalism is the theoretical perspective that the principles of [[neoclassical economics]] can be applied to our understanding of all human societies.

'''Free Painters and Sculptors (FPS)''' is an artist-led organisation based in [[London]], England, which regularly exhibits every year. It played a pivotal role in the establishment of [[abstract art]] in the 1950s and 1960s.

== History ==

=== Background ===

FPS was founded in 1952 by a number of members of the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]] who wanted to create their own painting group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fpshistory.blogspot.co.uk|title=The History of Free Painters and Sculptors|last=Rasmussen|first=Roy|date=1992|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known initially as 'Painters Group from the ICA', the idea of freedom was one of the group's core beliefs. In the aftermath of World War II it was vital for the group to be able to stand for principles of artistic freedom and each artist was free to express themselves however they chose. Artists with a 'modern approach' were welcomed, generally falling into abstract or figurative camps.

=== Formative Years ===

The first exhibition was held at the end of 1953 in the Three Arts Centre, Great Cumberland Place and was opened by art critic [[John Berger]]. Twenty six artists exhibited.

Soon after this the group was renamed the 'Free Painters Group' and annual exhibitions followed in Walker's Galleries on New Bond Street. There were also satellite exhibitions in the New Vision Centre Gallery on Seymour Place, Marble Arch and the Drian Gallery on Porchester Place, Bayswater.

These three galleries were early natural homes for the group: The Walker's Galleries had been the location of the first exhibition of the [[Seven and Five Society]] - a natural predecessor of the Free Painters Group; New Vision Centre Gallery was run by members [[Denis Bowen]], Halima Nalecz and [[Frank Avray Wilson]] and was a hub for the avant-garde and experimental.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Marlowe (31 March 2006). [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/mar/31/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries "Denis Bowen: Painter, teacher and promoter of the avant-garde in Britain"]. ''The Guardian''. p. 36. Retrieved 18 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Halima Nalecz also ran the Drian Gallery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/galleries/drian-galleries|title=Drian Galleries|last=|first=|date=|website=Artist Biographies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many exhibitions were held there by members over the years.

=== Middle Years ===

In the early 1960s the group began to stage exhibitions at the FBA Galleries in Suffolk Street, Pall Mall. This larger venue was well suited to the growing number of members and also was able to house larger works that were created.

With this increasing membership and more sculptors in the group, in 1965 'Free Painters Group' was renamed to its current name of 'Free Painters and Sculptors'. Also at this time, FPS became a registered charity.

Exhibitions were gathering more interest and garnered reviews in local and national press. As well as an annual exhibition (now branded 'Trends'), many members staged exhibitions around the UK as well as overseas.

In the early 1970s a desire to find venues aside from the annual exhibition was facilitated by the then-secretary of the group Nina Hosali. Nina's mother Kate Hosali had founded the [[Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad|Society for Protection of Animals in North Africa]] (SPANA) in 1923 and the headquarters were at their home at 15 Buckingham Gate. The property was used by the free painters for meetings and storage space and in 1972 the [[loggia]] in its gardens was turned into a permanent gallery space - the Loggia Gallery and Sculpture Garden.

In 1973 'Trends' moved to the Mall Galleries, Pall Mall and exhibited there until the next decade.

Membership by the mid 1970s had grown rapidly and was at a peak of nearly 500.

=== Later Years ===

The 1980s saw the group achieve a milestone of 30 years but the period saw challenges. The group had healthy{{Clarify|reason=healthy in terms of what?|date=January 2018}} number of members but had to work hard to ensure that quality remained high. In addition, founding members were reaching old age and retirement and their loss was felt. Lastly, societal changes meant whereas the group had always been London focussed, it had to look outwards as artists left London.{{According to whom|date=January 2018}}

However, these challenges created interesting opportunities whereby exhibitions outside of London were staged and new blood was found. A new generation of artists joined the ranks and thus kept the group relevant and vital. Exhibitions continued to be held at the London venue of the Loggia Gallery although other suitable venues in London were harder and increasingly expensive to come by.{{According to whom|date=January 2018}}

=== Modern Era ===

FPS celebrated its 65th anniversary in 2017. It currently has over 50 members, both from the UK and overseas. Membership is granted by election of the Executive Committee on the submission of acceptable samples of work.

FPS exhibits at least twice year in London, most recently at the Menier Gallery and the gallery at the [[Oxo Tower]]. An annual Open exhibition celebrates the work of members alongside selected work chosen from artist submissions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1361">In [[art]], '''frottage''' (from French ''frotter'', "to rub", [[Rubbing]]) is a [[surrealism|surrealist]] and "automatic" method of creative production developed by [[Max Ernst]]. 

==Details==
In frottage, the artist places a piece of paper over an [[surface texture|uneven surface]] then marks the paper with a drawing tool (such as a '''pastel''' or [[pencil]]): thus creating a rubbing. The drawing can be left as it is or used as the basis for further refinement. While superficially similar to [[brass rubbing]] and other forms of [[rubbing]] intended to reproduce an existing subject, and in fact sometimes being used as an alternative term for it, frottage differs in being [[aleatoric]] and random in nature.{{Cn|date=July 2015}}

It was developed by Ernst in 1925. Ernst was inspired by an ancient wooden floor where the grain of the planks had been accentuated by many years of scrubbing. The patterns of the graining suggested strange images to him. He captured these by laying sheets of paper on the floor and then rubbing over them with a soft pencil.

'''''Heer Ranjha''''' is one of several popular tragic romances of [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The others are ''[[Mirza Sahiba]]'' and ''[[Sohni Mahiwal]]''. There are several poetic narrations of the story, the most famous being 'Heer' by [[Waris Shah]] written in 1766. It tells the story of the love of Heer and her lover Ranjha.&lt;ref&gt;http://apnaorg.com/research-papers/english/paper-9/page-1.shtml, Heer Ranjha, research paper on epic poem written by Waris Shah in 1766 on Academy of the Punjab in North America website, Retrieved 1 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Heer Ranjha's tombstone.jpg|thumb|250px|Heer Ranjha's tombstone]]

''Heer Ranjha'' was written by Waris Shah. Some historians say that the story was the original work of Shah, written after he had fallen in love with a girl named Bhag Bhari.&lt;ref name="hanif"&gt;{{citation|title=Biographical Encyclopaedia of Sufis: South Asia|author=N. Hanif|page=387|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that Heer and Ranjha were real personalities who lived under the [[Lodi dynasty]] and that Waris Shah later utilised these personalities for his story. Shah states that the story has a deeper meaning, referring to the unrelenting quest that man has towards God.&lt;ref name="pirzada"&gt;{{citation|title=Chasing Love Up against the Sun|page=12|author=Waqar Pirzada|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example from the epic poem==
Rag Heer Ranjha. The invocation at the beginning,&lt;ref&gt;In Waris Shah's version there is an added invocation to the famous [[Panj peer]] or five saints&lt;/ref&gt; in one version:

:Awal-akhir naam Allah da lena, duja dos Muhammad Miran
:Tija naun maat pita da lena, unha da chunga dudh sariran
:Chautha naun unn paani da lena, jis khaave man banhe dhiran
:Panjman naun Dharti Maata da lena, jis par kadam takiman
:Chhewan naun Khwaja Pir da lena, jhul pilave thande niran
:Satwan naun Guru Gorakhnath de lena, pataal puje bhojan
:Athwan naun lalaanwale da lena, bande bande de tabaq zanjiran

:First take the name of Allah and second the Great Muhammad, the prophet [of God]
:Third, take the name of father and mother, on whose milk my body thrived
:Fourth, take the name of bread and water, by eating which my heart is gladdened
:Fifth, take the name of Mother Earth, on whom I place my feet.
:Sixth, take the name of Khwaja (Khizr, the Saint), who gives me cold water to drink
:Seventh, take the name of Guru Gorakh Nath who is worshipped with a platter of milk and rice
:Eighth, take the name of Lalanwala who breaks the bonds and the chains of captives

==Summary of the love story==
[[File:Luddan ferries Ranjha across the Chenab.jpg|left|thumb|Luddan ferries Ranjha across the Chenab]]
Heer is an extremely beautiful woman, born into a wealthy family of the [[Sial tribe]] in [[Jhang]] which is now [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], Pakistan. Ranjha (whose first name is Dheedo; Ranjha is the surname,his caste is Ranjha[Jatt]), a Jat of the [[Ranjha (tribe)|Ranjha]] tribe, is the youngest of four brothers and lives in the village of [[Takht Hazara]] by the river [[Chenab]]. Being his father's favorite son, unlike his brothers who had to toil in the lands, he led a life of ease, playing the flute ('Wanjhli'/'[[Bansuri]]'). After a quarrel with his brothers over land, Ranjha leaves home. In Waris Shah's version of the epic, it is said that Ranjha left his home because his brothers' wives refused to give him food. Eventually he arrives in Heer's village and falls in love with her. Heer's father offers Ranjha a job herding his cattle. Heer becomes mesmerised by the way Ranjha plays his flute and eventually falls in love with him. They meet each other secretly for many years until they are caught by Heer's jealous uncle, Kaido, and her parents Chuchak and Malki. Heer is forced by her family and the local priest or '[[Maulvi]]' to marry another man named Saida Khera.

Ranjha is heartbroken. He wanders the countryside alone, until eventually he meets a [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] [[Jogi]] (ascetic). After meeting [[Gorakhnath]], the founder of the "Kanphata" (pierced ear) sect of jogis at [[Tilla Jogian]] (the 'Hill of Ascetics', located 50 miles north of the historic town of [[Bhera]], [[Sargodha District]], Punjab), Ranjha becomes a jogi himself, piercing his ears and renouncing the material world. While reciting the name of the Lord, he wanders all over Punjab, eventually finding the village where Heer now lives.

The two return to Heer's village, where Heer's parents agree to their marriage - though some versions of the story state that the parent's agreement is only a deception. On the wedding day, Kaido poisons her food so that the wedding will not take place, in order to punish the girl for her behaviour. Hearing this news, Ranjha rushes to aid Heer, but is too late, as she has already eaten the poison and has died. Brokenhearted once again, Ranjha eats the remaining poisoned ''[[Laddu]]'' (sweet) which Heer has eaten and dies by her side.

Heer and Ranjha are buried in Heer's hometown, Jhang. Love-smitten couples and others often pay visits to their mausoleum.&lt;ref&gt;Tomb of Heer Ranjha in Jhang.Pakistan Geotagging website link:http://pakgeotagging.blogspot.com/2014/05/tomb-of-heer-ranjha-in-jhang-takht.html, Retrieved 1 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
==Legacy and influence==
Because its plot involves a romance opposed by family members and ends with the two lovers dying, the story is often compared to the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sirhandi|first=Marcella C.|date=1999-09-01|title=Manipulating Cultural Idioms|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00043249.1999.10791952|journal=Art Journal|volume=58|issue=3|pages=40–47|doi=10.1080/00043249.1999.10791952|issn=0004-3249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/27353/689057.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The epic poem has been made into several feature films between 1928 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citwf.com/listFilms.asp?filmName=Heer+Ranjha, List of many films made on the love story of Heer Ranjha on Complete Index To World Film website, Retrieved 1 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herbert Avraham Haggiag Pagani''' (25 April 1944 in [[Tripoli]] &amp;ndash; 16 August 1988 in [[Palm Springs, California]]) was an Italian artist and musician.

Pagani was born in a Jewish family in [[Libya]] when it was an Italian Colonial Administration. He spent his childhood and adolescence between Italy, Germany and France. This nonstop wandering about different cultures drove him to seek out a personal language that would enable him to express himself non-verbally, and he started drawing. 

In 1964 Pagani, at the age of twenty, had his first exhibition at the Pierre Picard Gallery in [[Cannes]], where he exhibited  a group of Indian-ink drawings and engravings. The French poet Jean Rousselot wrote an enthusiastic review in ''Planete'', describing Pagani as a "Twenty-years-old Visionary". Among his first Italian collectors were Giorgio Soavi, [[Federico Fellini]], Bernardino Zapponi and the [[Olivetti]] Collection. Shortly afterwards, he was invited to contribute a series of drawings for the [[Planète (review)|Planète]] review edited by [[Jacques Bergier]] and [[Louis Pauwels]], becoming one of the youngest exponents of the [[Fantastic Realism]]. In 1965 Pagani illustrated ''Fantarca'' by Giuseppe Berto for [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]], and ''Brave New World'' by Aldous Huxley for the Club des Amis du Livre.

Parallel to art, Pagani pursued an interest in music. His first Italian album was released in 1967. In 1969, the day after Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]] coup d'état, the Libyan police broke into Pagani's family's house in Tripoli. A hundred and fifty canvases and drawings were destroyed. His first French album, chronicling those events, was released in 1970. Pagani designed the covers of his records, and the stage designs of his shows.

In 1971, Pagani had a solo exhibition at the [[Théâtre de la Ville]] in [[Paris]] called ''Concerto d'Italie'' where he did a performance inside his drawings projected on a large screen by Laser Graphics Group. This was the first [[Diaporama]] exhibition staged in Europe.  Less interested in a single technique than in investigating the correlation among all the techniques he was to try out, Pagani declared that "Engraving on stone, or vinyl, is the same thing. It is more important to establish one' s mental and emotional territory with all available means". 

In 1973 Pagani used documentary footage made available by the Italian Television Corporation to produce and direct a 27-minute movie-pamphlet entitled ''Venise, amore mio'' which Unesco defined as "the best vehicle of information on the dangers besetting Venice and its lagoon". French Television broadcast it twice, on Antenne 2.

In 1975, Pagani composed the music and designed the stage set for ''Megalopolis'' a total-opera based on ''Medioevo Prossimo Venturo'' (The near future middleages) with a libretto by Roberto Vacca. In order to represent the congestion and collapse of the Energy Systems as described by the Italian futurologist, Pagani proceeded to clone on thousands of images of modern civilization using the first two Rank Xerox colour duplicators installed in France and in Italy. The "xerographies" assembled on large plates were photographed, projected and animated in ''Multimage'' shows on giant screens. ''Megalopolis'' was selected by the French Ministry of Culture for the re-opening of the Palais de Chaillot at the [[Trocadéro|Trocadero]]. It was subsequently staged at [[Festival dei Due Mondi]] in Spoleto. In 1976 it received the ''Grand Prize of Academy Charles Cros''.

In 1977 Pagani experimented with abstraction, mostly with a video-synthetizers devised by the French electronics engineer Marcel Dupouy. Despite his keen interest in technology, Pagani never refrained from using paper, pencils, paints and brushes. Influenced by [[Arte povera]], he started working with discarded materials he would collect from beaches and in dumps across Europe. His sculptures, mostly made of old shoes, were exhibited at Centro internazionale di Brera, [[Milan]] and Palazzo dei Diamanti, [[Ferrara]].

Pagani died of [[leukaemia]], aged 44 in [[Palm Springs]].
Pagani is buried in Tel Aviv Kyriat Shaul cemetery.

'''Hâfiz Osman''' ({{lang-ota|حافظ عثمان}} [[Turkish language|Modern Turkish]]: ''Hâfız Osman'') (1642–1698) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[calligrapher]] noted for improving the script and for developing a layout template for the [[hilya|hilye]] which became the classical approach to page design.

Uğur Derman, ''Masterpieces of Ottoman Calligraphy from the Sakıp Sabancı Museum'', İstanbul, Sabancı Üniversitesi. pp. 82–83, {{ISBN|978-975-8362-45-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied ''nashk'' and ''sulus'' with Derviş Ali, and was certified by Suyolcuzade Mustafa Eyyubi.&lt;ref&gt;Kemal Çiçek, Ercüment Kuran, Nejat Göyünç, İlber Ortaylı, ''The Great Ottoman-Turkish Civilisation,'' Volume 3, Yeni Türkiye, 2000, n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; Osman also admired the work of the 15th-century calligrapher, [[Seyh Hamdullah]], and spent many hours copying his works assiduously in order to perfect his craft.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, J.R., ''Letters of Light: Arabic Script in Calligraphy, Print, and Digital Design'', Harvard University Press, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Osman revived some of the six scripts that had fallen into disuse. These scripts underwent a process of purification and became known as "Hâfiz Osman's style". The younger generation of calligraphers preferred this style, and it gradually replaced Hamdullah's style.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ugur Derman, "The Art of Calligraphy in the Ottoman Regime, in: Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu (ed.), ''History of Ottoman State and Civilisation'', II, Istanbul 2003, pp 645-652&lt;/ref&gt;

Osman was not only a fine calligrapher, but was also a master of layout. He raised text design to new heights, often incorporating different styles of calligraphy on the same page. His masterpiece is the Ottoman, ''[[Hilya|hilye]]''; a design template that includes eight distinct elements arranged aesthetically to provide for contemplative reflection and devotion. The elements are: ''Ba makan'' (prelude); ''Gobek'' (belly); ''Hilal'' (crescent); ''Ko'eler'' (corners); ''Ayak'' (verse); ''Etek'' (foot); ''Koltukar'' (alleys) and ''Pervaz'' (frame). His ''[[Hilya|hilye]]'' became the standard layout in the Ottoman world.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, J.R., ''Letters of Light: Arabic Script in Calligraphy, Print, and Digital Design'', Harvard University Press, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;  

A ''hilye'' is a calligraphic panel containing a [[hadith]]-based text describing the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]'s physical appearance and attributes. Hâfiz Osman incorporated such texts, which had been popular for some time, in a formal design that soon became standard for this art form. ''Hilye'' came to be used as wall decorations or surface adornments, fulfilling much the same function as figurative paintings in other religious traditions. While containing a concrete and artistically appealing description of Prophet's appearance, they complied with the strictures against figurative depictions of the Prophet, leaving his appearance to the viewer's imagination.&lt;ref name="Peters2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=F. E. Peters|title=Jesus and Muhammad: Parallel Tracks, Parallel Lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olEi-1LZYYQC&amp;pg=PA160|accessdate=5 November 2011|date=10 November 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-974746-7|pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hâfiz Osman also reinvigorated Hamdullah's tradition, in particular the re-introduction of a number of scripts that had fallen into disuse. Among his surviving works are copies of the [[Koran]] held at the [[Topkapi Palace]] Museum Library in Istanbul and the Nasser D. Khalili Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calligraphyqalam.com/people/hafiz-osman.html|title=CalligraphyQalam.com - Arabic, Ottoman &amp; Persian Calligraphy - Hafiz Osman|website=calligraphyqalam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volumes of the Koran produced by Osman were among the most highly sought-after in his time.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. Books: A Living History. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum, 2011. p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

He gave lessons to the poor on Sundays and lessons to the wealthy on Wednesdays.&lt;ref&gt; Huart, C., ''Les Calligraphes et les Miniaturistes de l'Orient Musulman''  1972, p. 148 [https://archive.org/details/lescalligraphes00huargoog Digital copy]&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his lifetime, he trained a large number of calligraphers, of whom the finest was [[Yedikuleli Seyyid 'Abdullah Efendi]]. &lt;ref&gt;Uğur Derman, M., ''Letters in Gold: Ottoman Calligraphy from the Sakıp Sabancı Collection,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998 , p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2562">The '''ikob - Museum of Contemporary Art''', founded in 1993 by Francis Feidler (director of the ikob until December 2012), is a museum of contemporary art in the German-speaking city of [[Eupen]] in [[Belgium]], nearby the German and Dutch borders.Its program focuses on emerging and leading contemporary art through the constitution of a significant collection – in progress – and temporary exhibitions – in Dialog. Thus, functioning as a discursive platform for contemporary art with a multidisciplinary and thematic exhibition program, concerned with critical and socio-political issues, the ikob attempts to reflect the matter of frontier.

Since January 2013, the ikob - Museum of Contemporary Art is directed by Dr. Maïté Vissault. 

==Exhibitions and collection==
The IKOB's sculpture exhibitions "Concept 93" (1993) and especially "Full Barns" (1997)  gained international attention because, the former [[Documenta]] organizer [[Manfred Schneckenburger]]  committed known European artists, such as [[Tony Cragg]], [[Wolfgang Nestler]], [[Maik and Dirk Löbbert]] or [[Marie Jo Lafontaine]] .

Since 2000, the IKOB organizes an international programme of exhibitions in new galleries and adding to its own collection.

==Arts funding==
The IKOB Art Award is awarded every three years to young artists since 2005. The jury, chaired by [[Jan Hoet]], selected the German artist Stefanie Klingemann as the first winner. The award is endowed with 5,000 €.

The following artists were nominated for the IKOB Art Award 2011: [[Tatjana Gerhard]], [[Brigitte Reisz]], [[Vera Hilger]], [[Judith Krebbekx]], [[Kati Heck]]. An international jury selected [[Kati Heck]] as the winner.

The '''International Comparative Literature Association''' - '''ICLA''') (French '''Association Internationale de Littérature Comparée''' - '''AILC'''), founded in 1954, is an international organization for international research in the field of [[comparative literature]]. The Association seeks to foster the study of literature undertaken from an international point of view and attempts to realize this objective through international cooperation. It organizes international congresses, occurring every three years.

== History ==
The AILC/ICLA was founded in [[Oxford|Oxford, UK]] in 1954 in connection with the 6th Congress of the [[The International Federation for Modern Languages and Literatures (FILLM)|International Federation for Modern Languages and Literatures]] (FILLM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillespie|first=Gerard|date=2003|title=The International Comparative Literatures Association (AILC/ICLA): Association Internationale de Littérature Comparéé|journal=Diogenes|volume=50|issue=2|page=117|doi=10.1177/039219210305000211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Balakian Prize ==
In 2004, the Association, in collaboration with the [[Anna Balakian]] Foundation, established the '''Anna Balakian Prize'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ailc-icla.org/site/?page_id=1335&lt;/ref&gt; to promote scholarly research by younger comparatists and to honor the memory of Professor Anna Balakian, a great comparatist.

'''''Jonah Lomu Rugby''''' is a video game released in 1997. It was developed by [[Rage Software]] and published by [[Codemasters]]. It was released on [[DOS]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn]]. Its title is a reference to former [[All Blacks]] winger [[Jonah Lomu]].

Following the 2003 closure of Rage Software, several members of the game's development team went on to work on ''[[World Championship Rugby]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Calvert |first=Justin |date=21 November 2003 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-championship-rugby-announced/1100-6084136/ |title=World Championship Rugby announced [date mislabeled as "November 24, 2003"] |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game has support for up to four players.&lt;ref name=SSM21&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Matt |last=Yeo |title=Men in Black |magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]] |issue=21|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=July 1997|pages=48-51}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of playable modes - including knock-out, [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]], regional competitions as well as historical matches.

==Development==
Rage Software head Trevor Williams recounted, "We wanted a game that stayed true to the rules, but was easy to pick up and play without a complete understanding of all the ins and outs."&lt;ref name=SSM20&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Preview: Jonah Lomu Rugby|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=20|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=June 1997|pages=32-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jonah Lomu Rugby'' was the first [[rugby union]] game released on the [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]]&lt;ref name=SSMrev/&gt; or [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] platforms. Programmers Tony McCabe and Antonio Argentieri explained that rugby video games are more difficult to make than other sports games, since the heavy specialization of the different players means a number of different AIs need to be designed and programmed to run simultaneously.&lt;ref name=SSM20/&gt; The [[Scrum (rugby union)|scrum]] was remodeled more than five times in an effort to make it work in play.&lt;ref name=SSM21/&gt;

Commentary for the game was supplied by [[Bill McLaren]] and [[Bill Beaumont]].&lt;ref name=SSM20/&gt;

The Saturn version was slated for release in June 1997, but the date was pushed back to September 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=First the Bad News |magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]] |issue=22|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=August 1997|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Matt Yeo gave the Saturn version a rave review in ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'', saying it "features one of the most innovative and easy to use game play systems ever utilised in a sports game." He particularly noted the use of on-screen menus during pauses in the game's action, saying they enable newcomers to more easily come to grips with the game by presenting rugby's complicated rules in a simplified, leisurely form. He also praised the four-player support, audio commentary, and dramatic weather conditions, and gave the game a score of 91%.&lt;ref name=SSMrev&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Matt|last=Yeo |title=Review: Jonah Lomu Rugby |magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]] |issue=21|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=July 1997|pages=62-63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8474">'''Karl Barth's views on Mary''' agreed with much [[Roman Catholic]] dogma but disagreed with the Catholic veneration of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]. [[Karl Barth|Barth]], a leading 20th-century theologian, was a [[Reformed Protestant]]. Aware of the common dogmatic tradition of the early Church, Barth fully accepted the dogma of Mary as the [[Mother of God]]. Through Mary, Jesus belongs to the human race. Through Jesus, Mary is Mother of God.

==Background==

===Theology of Karl Barth===
Karl Barth (May 10, 1886 &amp;ndash; December 10, 1968) a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Reformed]] theologian, was one of the most important Christian thinkers of the 20th century. Beginning with his experience as a pastor, he rejected the predominant [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] theology typical of 19th-century [[Protestantism]], especially [[Germany|German]], and instead embarked on a unique theological path, often labelled [[neo-orthodoxy]] by critics (a label emphatically rejected by Barth himself), that emphasized the sovereignty of God particularly through his innovative doctrine of [[predestination|election]]. Barth's theology swept through Europe and Britain.

Barth was originally trained in German [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Liberal Christianity|Liberalism]] under such teachers as [[Wilhelm Herrmann]], but reacted against this theology at the time of the [[World War I|First World War]].  His reaction was fed by several factors, including his commitment to the German and Swiss [[International League of Religious Socialists|Religious Socialist]] movement surrounding men like [[Hermann Kutter]], the influence of the [[Biblical Realism]] movement surrounding men like [[Christoph Blumhardt]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and the impact of the [[skepticism|skeptical philosophy]] of [[Franz Overbeck]].

===Epistle to the Romans===
In his commentary ''[[The Epistle to the Romans]]'' (Ger. ''Der Römerbrief''; particularly in the thoroughly re-written second edition of 1922) Barth argued that the God who is revealed in the cross of [[Jesus]] challenges and overthrows any attempt to ally God with human cultures, achievements, or possessions.  Many theologians believe this work to be the most important theological treatise since [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]'s ''[[On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despisers]].''

In the decade following the First World War, Barth was linked with a number of other theologians, actually very diverse in outlook, who had reacted against their teachers' liberalism, in a movement known as "[[Dialectical Theology]]" &lt;ref&gt;(Ger. ''Dialektische Theologie'').&lt;/ref&gt;  Other members of the movement included [[Rudolf Bultmann]], [[Eduard Thurneysen]], [[Emil Brunner]], and [[Friedrich Gogarten]].

==Marian views==

===The nativity mystery===

* ''The nativity mystery  “conceived from the [[Holy Spirit]] and born from the [[Virgin Mary]]”,  means,  that God became human, truly human out of his own grace. The miracle of the existence of Jesus , his “climbing down of God” is: Holy Spirit and Virgin Mary! Here is a human being, the Virgin Mary,  and as he comes from God, Jesus comes also from this human being. Born of the Virgin Mary means a human origin for God.  Jesus Christ is not only truly God, he is human like every one of us. He is human without limitation. He is not only similar to us, he is like us''.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Dogmatik im Grundriss,  1947, 125,127&lt;/ref&gt;

This means to Barth, God's presence in our world, His presence as man among men and therefore God's revelation to humanity. It also means humanity's reconciliation with God. To Barth,  this happened and still happens,  it is the substance of the Christmas message.

This God is conceived where we all are conceived. He is born of Mary. She who conceived and bore Him, plays our part in the wonder of Christmas, for it concerns us. God has come to us. "Disguised in our flesh and blood, is the Eternal God."

=== Virgin Birth ===
The [[Nicene Creed]] says: ''Et incarnatus est de Spiritu Sancto ex Maria virgine et homo factus est'' ("and he [God the Son] became body from the Virgin Mary and was made man").  In Barth's theology – in contrast to much of the contemporary liberal theology – this statement is interpreted to mean the [[dogma]] of the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Birth]]. It means that Jesus as a human does not have a father, in the same way that as the Son of God he has no mother. The Holy Spirit, through whom Mary conceived, is not just any spirit, it is God himself whose act must be understood spiritually and not physically.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatic I, 2,  219&lt;/ref&gt;   Mary is "full of grace" according to Barth, but this grace is not earned but totally given to her. This is quite similar to Catholic teaching, in which Mary, "by sheer grace," received the fullness of grace from God at the moment of her conception, that she might give her consent at the annunciation.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 722&lt;/ref&gt;  Barth argues that the Church adopted its doctrine of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] not because of Mary, but in defence of its [[Christology]].

=== Mother of God ===

Karl Barth states that as a Christian and theologian, he  does not reject the description of Mary as the "Mother of God." To him, this is a legitimate expression of Christological truth. The description of Mary as the "Mother of God" was and is sensible, permissible and necessary as an auxiliary Christological proposition.&lt;ref&gt;Church Dogmatics, I, 2, Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1963, 138)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barth2004-1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Barth|title=Church Dogmatics: The doctrine of the word of God (2 pts.)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Po0rhLSFx0wC&amp;pg=PA138|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-567-05069-4|pages=138–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of the Catholic view ===
Barth on the other hand sees the term "Mother of God," as "being overloaded by the so-called Mariology of the Roman Catholic Church".&lt;ref&gt;Church Dogmatics, 138&lt;/ref&gt; 
He considered the Roman Catholic veneration of Mary a terrible mistake and heresy.

* ''Where ever Mary is venerated, and devotion to her takes place, there the Church of Christ does not exist''.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatik, I, 2, 154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barth2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Barth|title=Church Dogmatics Study Edition 3: The Doctrine of the Word of God I.2 § 13-15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=APXR1E0m_AkC&amp;pg=PA145|date=2 September 2010|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-567-02766-5|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* ''Mariology is an excrescence, i.e., a diseased construct of theological thought. Excrescences must be excised.'' &lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatik, I, 2, 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barth2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Barth|title=Church Dogmatics: The doctrine of the word of God (2 pts.)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Po0rhLSFx0wC&amp;pg=PA139|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-567-05069-4|pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He warns however, of extending this critique too far:
{{quote|It is not recommended that we should base our repudiation [of Marian doctrine] on the assertion that there has taken place here an irruption from the heathen sphere, an adoption of the idea, current in many non-Christian religions, of a more or less central and original female or mother deity. In dogmatics you can establish everything and nothing from parallels from the history of religions.&lt;ref&gt;Church Dogmatics, Vol. 1, p. 143).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And, Barth equally attacks Protestant theology on this issue: "For justice sake, one has to say, that the Protestant rejection of Roman Catholic mariology and Marian cult is dishonest, as long as Protestantism is caught in the same unreal problem".&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatic, I,2,160&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close friend of [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], who published about him. Barth’s dogmatic theology was partly based on [[Thomas Aquinas]], although he departed from Aquinas on many characteristically Catholic points.

[[Fania Records]] was credited for popularizing salsa music, with acts such as [[Rubén Blades]], [[Héctor Lavoe]], and [[Celia Cruz]] expanding the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bernstein |first1=Arthur |last2=Sekine |first2=Naoki |last3=Weismann |first3=Dick |title=The Global Music Industry Three Perspectives. |date=2013 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |location=Hoboken |isbn=978-1-135-92248-1 |page=78 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTnaAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, an influx of balladeers from Spain such as [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Camilo Sesto]], and [[Raphael (singer)|Raphael]] established their presence on the music charts both in Latin America and the US Latin market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salaverri |first1=Fernando |title=Spain Establishing the Latin European Link |journal=Billboard |date=November 3, 1979 |volume=91 |issue=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zCQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=March 24, 2017 |issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[OTI Festival]] was established by the [[Organización de Telecomunicaciones de Iberoamérica]] as a songwriting contest to connect the Ibero-American countries (Latin America, Spain, and Portugal) together. Ramiro Burr of ''Billboard'' noted that the contest was considered to be the "largest and most prestigious songwriting festival in the Latin music world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burr |first1=Ramiro |title=Mexican Quartet Captures Top OTI Prize |journal=Billboard |date=January 5, 1991 |page=61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s ===
In the 1980s, the [[Latin ballad]] continued to be the main form of Latin pop music, with [[Juan Gabriel]], [[José José]], Julio Iglesias, [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]], and [[José Luis Rodríguez (singer)|José Luis Rodríguez]] dominating the charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Rg8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=jose+jose+el+principe+de+la+cancion#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Prince's 40-Year Reign: A Billboard Q&amp;A |last=Cobo |first=Leila |volume=115 |issue=48 |page=28 |date=November 29, 2003 |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salsa music]] lost some traction, and its musical style changed to a slower rhythm with more emphasis on romantic lyrics. This became known as the [[salsa romantica]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pietrobruno |first1=Sheenagh |title=Salsa and Its Transnational Moves |date=2006 |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lanham |isbn=978-0-7391-6058-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990s ===
[[Bolero]] music saw a resurgence of popularity with the younger audience. Mexican singer [[Luis Miguel]] was credited for the renewed interest due to the success of his album, ''[[Romance (Luis Miguel album)|Romance]]'' (1991), a collection of classics covered by the artist.&lt;ref name="ageless"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ageless+romance+with+bolero.-a017482173 |title=Ageless Romance with Bolero |last=Holston |first=Mark |journal=Américas |date=September 1, 1995 |accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1990s, [[Latin pop]] music was dominated by younger artists such as [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]] alumnus [[Ricky Martin]], Colombian teen [[Shakira]], and Julio's son [[Enrique Iglesias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Powell |first1=John |title=Encyclopedia of North American immigration |date=2005 |publisher=Facts On File |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4381-1012-7 |page=92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VNCX6UsdZYkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, artists from Italy such as [[Eros Ramazzotti]], [[Laura Pausini]], and [[Nek]] successfully [[crossover (music)|crossed over]] to the Latin music field by recording Spanish-language versions of their songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Obejas |first1=Achy |authorlink1=Achy Obejas |title=Italian Artists Conquer Latin Music Charts |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-04-04/news/9904040139_1_latin-music-eros-ramazzotti-italian |accessdate=January 4, 2015 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=April 4, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Regional Mexican]] field, [[Tejano music|Tejano]] became the most prominent genre. [[Selena]] helped push Tejano music into the mainstream market with her albums ''[[Entre a Mi Mundo]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amor Prohibido]]'' (1994), although the genre's popularity declined following [[Murder of Selena|her death]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Saldana |first1=Hector |title=Tejano music enjoyed a decade-long golden age |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Tejano-music-enjoyed-a-decade-long-golden-age-6447952.php |accessdate=March 24, 2016 |work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |date=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[tropical music]] field, [[merengue music|merengue]], which gained attention in the 1980s, rivaled [[salsa music|salsa]] in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Nelson |title=A look at contemporary Merengue.

=== 2000s ===
In the mid-2000s, [[reggaeton]] became popular in the mainstream market, with [[Daddy Yankee]], [[Don Omar]], and [[Wisin &amp; Yandel]] considered to be the frontiers of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Resto-Montero |first1=Gabriela |title=The Unstoppable Rise of Reggaeton |url=http://fusion.kinja.com/the-unstoppable-rise-of-reggaeton-1793854249 |website=Fusion |accessdate=May 19, 2017 |date=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tropical music scene, [[bachata (music)|bachata]] music became popular in the field, with artists such as [[Monchy &amp; Alexandra]] and [[Aventura (band)|Aventura]] finding success in the urban areas of Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cobo |first1=Leila |title=Tropical Paradise |journal=Billboard |date=August 15, 2009 |volume=121 |issue=32 |page=31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AHcbf1oaC8UC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=May 19, 2017 |issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Banda (music)|Banda]] was the dominant genre in the Regional Mexican music field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Henderson |first1=Alex |title=Me Cambiaste la Vida – Rogelio Martinez |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/me-cambiaste-la-vida-mw0000474613 |website=AllMusic |accessdate=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010s ===
By the turn of the decade, the Latin music field became dominated by up-tempo rhythms, including electropop, reggaeton, urban, banda and contemporary bachata music, as Latin ballads and crooners fell out of favor among U.S. Latin radio programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cobo |first1=Leila |authorlink1=Leila Cobo |title=Latin Noise: We Want Our Ballads |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin-notas/6244251/latin-music-we-want-our-ballads |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |accessdate=September 8, 2015 |date=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Streaming media|Streaming]] has become the dominant form of revenue in the Latin music industry in the United States, Latin America and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Melendez |first1=Angel |title=Why Are Spanish Songs More Popular on YouTube?

The '''Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum''' (MHOF) honors all musicians regardless of genre or instrument. The MHOF timeline starts with the beginning of recorded music and inductees are nominated by current members of the [[American Federation of Musicians]] and by other music industry professionals.

== First museum ==

The museum first opened June 6, 2006 at 301 6th Ave. S., [[Nashville, Tennessee]] Exhibits consisted of instruments owned and played by well-known artists as well as behind-the-scenes session musicians.  These musicians were often the house studio musicians in cities such as [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Detroit]], [[Nashville]], [[Muscle Shoals]] and [[New York City]].  These musicians were often the unsung heroes behind the hits of many great artists. These relatively small groups of players often recorded the majority of hits in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  The museum was voted venue of the year by the [[Meeting Professionals International]] in 2008.

== Closing and reopening ==

In February 2010, under the rules of [[eminent domain]], the city of Nashville purchased the MHOF property in order to make room for the [[Music City Center]] (new convention center). On August 29, 2013 the MHOF reopened on the first floor of the historic [[Nashville Municipal Auditorium]] just off the James Robertson Parkway exit at 401 Gay Street, Nashville, TN 37219.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2013/08/27/musicians-hall-of-fame-reopens-in-nashville-after-three-year-absence/&lt;/ref&gt; The 200,000 square foot building houses the historic 10,000 seat Municipal Auditorium. The 68,000 sq. ft. exhibit floor, which was also Nashville's first convention center, will now house the museums artifacts and museum.&lt;ref name=np/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsmv/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12352">'''Myrlande Constant''' is a Haitian and [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] artist who was born in 1968. Constant is married and the mother of four children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indigoarts.com/artist/myrlande-constant|title=Myrlande Constant|last=|first=|date=October 26, 2015|website=Indigo Arts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Constant was born in [[Port-au-Prince]] in [[Haiti]] where, as a teenager, she learned the art of beading while working with her mother in a Port-au-Prince factory making wedding dresses. Once she quit that job she moved on to be one of the most celebrated artists for making Vodou drapo.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"&gt;Donald J.Cosentino, and Edwidge Danticat, ''In Extremis: Death and Life in 21st-century Haitian Art,'' (Los Angeles, CA: Fowler Museum at UCLA, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.183}} Constant has taken part in the revolution in the art of drapo-making over the last two decades. She has been making flags since the 1900s. Since the 1900s, there was an abrupt shift in drapo-making, which was primarily a male art form. There are several new designers who are women now, one of them being Myrlande Constant. Because of the impact that Constant has on other people, she influences art making in other individuals, in particular [[Marilyn Houlberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald J. Cosentino, "Bicentennial blues," ''African Arts'' 37, no. 3 (2004), 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Constant bears witness to her nation's calamities. For example, after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, the artwork Myrlande made represented the collectivistic society through the things that were going on at the time.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.20}}

Her works are densely beaded flags (some as large as six by seven feet). Constant’s flags are much larger than traditional flags. In 2011, Constant participated in a series of exhibitions, workshops, and lectures at [[Brown University]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] where she conducted a three-day flag-making workshop.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.183}}

== Principal expositions and works ==
Myrlande Constant had her first sale to Richard A Morse, who was the manager of the Oloffson Hotel in Port-au-Prince. Other subsequent sales of her outstanding Vodou flags were made through the connections of her husband, Charles, who convinced customers and visitors at the hotel to buy her work. Many of Constant’s inspiration of her artwork came from her father who is a Vodou priest and Christian. She states that she has no one to thank but the spirits and God before the spirits. She additionally states that the mystical feelings and aspirations come from her thoughts.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.185}} Everything she puts on a flag is there for a reason because the spirit keeps her working. Constant is also inspired by Milo Rigaud’s landmark book called ''Veve''. This book contains symbolic drawings of spirits made on Vodou temple floors. Constant uses that inspiration to remember her memories of Vodou ceremonies and knowledge of the spirits to create her own design in the flags.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.185}}

The main process of the making of her flags starts with pencil drawings on white cloth. Second, she sews the sequins and beads to the cloth. Lastly, she incorporates the colors that associate with the spirits. Typically, most of her works are as large as bedspreads depicting various significant events in Vodou and Haitian history through using needle, thread, cloth, and tiny adornments.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.185}}

Constant is particularly a well known Haitian and Vodou artist in many parts of the world. Specifically, her piece of the 2010 Haiti earthquake apocalypse was recognized as an immediate potential for becoming one of the 2011 Ghetto Biennale Exhibition in [[New York (state)|New York]]’s most extreme and powerful artistic visions.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.9}}

'''''Haiti madi 12 januye 2010''''' (Haiti Tuesday, January 12, 2010)

239 x 249 cm

Private collection

This piece of artwork is made with fabric, beads, and sequins. Myrlande Constant’s tableau depicts the ruins and aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. It was funded by the [[Fowler Museum at UCLA|Fowler Museum]] with funds provided by the Fay Bettye Green Fund to Commission New Work. This piece makes the viewer feel the need to study the miseries and disasters that happen in the human life. The chaoticness of the imagery resembles how chaotic the actual event was in 2010. The visual characteristics include a border of crossbones and skulls, and angels and God looking down on the situation resembling the prophet Ezekiel’s vision of dry bones: “The hand of the Lord was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and set me in the middle of the valley, it was full of bones. [[Ezekiel]] 37:1).” Other aspects of this piece include homes, churches, and vodou temples all being reduced to rubble. Dogs and pigs gnaw on the unburied unprotected human remains. The Catholic Archbishop Serge Miot, who is a man of [[God]], lies dead under the fallen roof of his cathedral with a hand on a bible. Other individuals in the piece are shown as Vodouists who either carry a child in their arms, or wheelbarrow the dead and wounded to the appropriate destinations as a summoning mortal to the hand of their maker in the call of Gabriel. More individuals either pick up the ruins, or sink to the ground as if remaining upright on solid earth is not an option. Constant’s piece depicted a meaning that explained the suffering as ultimately, just as with life, letting death go on. Looking forward to Ash Wednesday being faithful, and having anticipation on Eastertide’s Resurrection were things that Constant reminded the victims of. The victims were shown “Remember that thou art dust, and to dust thou shalt return”. And so, too the Gede will rise up to their feet, shake off the dirt, adjust their glasses, straighten their hats, grab their canes and crutches, and dance.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.141}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9309">'''Nuclear art''' was an artistic tendency developed  by some artists and painters, after the bombings of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]].

==Conception and origins==
In the days, weeks and years following the atomic bombing of Japan, trained and untrained artists who survived the bombings began documenting their experiences in artworks.&lt;ref name="MIT Ground Zero"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. occupation authorities controlled the release of photographs and film footage of these events, while photographers and artists on the ground continued to produce visual representations of the effects of nuclear warfare. Photographer [[Yōsuke Yamahata]] began taking photographs of Nagasaki on August 10, 1945 (the day after the bombing), however his photographs were not released to the public until 1952 when the magazine ''[[Asahi Gurafu]]'' published them.&lt;ref name="Unforgettable Fire" &gt;{{cite book

===Historical nuclear art in Italy===
In 1948, the artistic movement of [[Eaismo]], published a manifesto illustrating some aspects of the [[atomic age]] and, at the same time, criticizing the industrial use of [[nuclear power]].&lt;ref &gt;G.Favati, V.Fontani, M.Landi, A.Neri, A.S.Pellegrini, Manifesto dell'Eaismo, Società Editrice Italiana, [[Livorno]], 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a movement of poetry and painting, founded by the Italian artist [[Voltolino Fontani]], aiming to balance the role of men in a society upset by  the danger  of [[nuclear radiation]].&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web

  |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/maria-grandinetti_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ 
  |accessdate=1 April 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic group was strengthened by the poet [[Marcello Landi]] and by the literary critic Guido Favati. In 1948 Voltolino Fontani depicted the disintegration and fragmentation of an [[atom]] on canvas, by creating the artwork: ''Dinamica di assestamento e mancata stasi''.

In 1951 the painters [[Enrico Baj]] and Sergio Dangelo created the {{illm|Arte nucleare movement|it}},  criticizing and putting the repetitiveness of painting (as an artistic and commercial phenomenon) in discussion.&lt;ref &gt;Luciano Caramel, Arte in Italia, 1945-1960, Vita e Pensiero, [[Milano]] 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
Plenty of Italian artists, in [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and foreigners like [[Yves Klein]], [[Asger Jorn]], [[Arman]], [[Antonio Saura]] joined the movement. The main representative of the arte nucleare movement was [[Piero Manzoni]], who in this context, for the first time in his life, put  his talent in evidence.&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.pieromanzoni.org/biografia_1933-57.htm, ''link read in April 2011'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Eaismo, recommending artists to pursue painting values (and poetry),&lt;ref &gt;G.Favati, V.Fontani, M.Landi, A.Neri, A.S.Pellegrini, Manifesto dell'Eaismo, Società Editrice Italiana, [[Livorno]], 1948&lt;/ref&gt; the arte nucleare movement tried to promote a new form of art in which painting was marginalized.&lt;ref &gt;[http://digilander.libero.it/contemporarea/AAI/ant38, Arman, Baj, Bemporad, Bertini, Colonne, Chapmans, Colucci, Dangelo, De Miceli, D'Haese, Hoeboer, Hundertwasser, Klein, Koenig, Manzoni, Nando, Noiret, A. e G. Pomodoro, Restany, Saura, Sordini, Vandercam ,Verga, Manifesto contro lo stile, Milano, 1959, link read in April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical nuclear art in Spain=== 
In the meantime, Spanish painter [[Salvador Dalì]] published the [[Mystical manifesto]] (1951), putting catholic mysticism and nuclear themes together.
In this period Dalì created artworks like [[Idillio atomico]] (1945) and [[Leda Atomica]] (1949).

===Historical nuclear art in France===

In 1949  the French artist [[Bernard Lorjou]] started to paint his monumental artwork “l’age atomique”  (The atomic age). The painting was concluded after one year and is now located in the [[Centre Pompidou]].

===Historical nuclear art in the United States===

The painter and photographer [[Eugene Von Bruenchenhein]] painted the artwork “Atomic age” in 1955,&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.ktfineart.com/past/?object_id=86&amp;show=project_images&amp;heading_id=&amp;project_id=90&amp;detail_id=602, link read in 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and other apocalyptical and post apocalyptical paintings up to 1965.

The British sculptor, [[Henry Moore]], created a bronze public sculpture, entitled, [[Nuclear Energy (sculpture)]] (1967) that depicted both the fatality of nuclear weapons as well as celebrated the invention of nuclear energy for use as electrical power. The sculpture is located on the grounds of the University of Chicago, where the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction was produced at the [[Chicago Pile-1]], under the oversight of the Manhattan Project and Enrico Fermi. The sculpture is in the form of a hybrid [[mushroom cloud]] and human skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Contemporary approaches to nuclear art==

===Japan===
After the March 2011 accident that caused three nuclear reactors to melt down at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan, there have been numerous responses by contemporary Japanese artists, including Shigenobu Yoshida, [[Tatsuo Miyajima]], [[Shimpei Takeda]], [[Fuyuki Yamakawa]], Iri and Toshi Maruki, and Hiroshima bomb survivor, Tadasi Tonoshiki.&lt;ref name="WEAD Atomic Legacy Art"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Дворцовая набережная через Неву.jpg|thumb|300px|The Palace Quay, as seen from the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]]]]
The '''Palace Embankment''' or '''Palace Quay''' is a street along the [[Neva River]] in [[Central Saint Petersburg]] which contains the complex of the [[Hermitage Museum]] buildings (including the [[Winter Palace]]), the [[Hermitage Theatre]], the [[Marble Palace]], the [[Vladimir Palace]], the [[New Michael Palace]], the [[Saltykov Mansion]] and the [[Summer Garden]].

The street was laid out between 1763 and 1767, when it used to be a preferred place of residence for the [[Russian Imperial]] Nobility. The street begins at the [[Palace Bridge]], where the [[Admiralty Embankment]] becomes the Palace Embankment, and the street ends at the [[Fontanka]], where it becomes the [[Kutuzov Embankment]].

The Palace Embankment is a very popular street among tourists, as it has a wonderful view of the Neva, the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] and [[Vasilievsky Island]]. Many [[sightseeing]] boats are available for hire there.

==Pushkin associations==

In his novel ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', [[Alexander Pushkin]] depicted himself walking along Palace Quay with his hero, Eugene Onegin:

[[Image:Pushkin&amp;onegin.jpg|thumb|150px|Pushkin's sketch representing himself and Onegin on Palace Quay.]]
&lt;div style="font-size:90%"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;''Filled with his heart's regrets, and leaning
&lt;br&gt;''Against the rampart's granite shelf,
&lt;br&gt;''Eugene stood lost in pensive dreaming
&lt;br&gt;''(As once some poet drew himself).
&lt;br&gt;''The night grew still... with silence falling;
&lt;br&gt;''Only the sound of sentries calling,
&lt;br&gt;''Or suddenly from [[Millionnaya Street|Million Street]]
&lt;br&gt;''Some distant droshky's rumbling beat;
&lt;br&gt;''Or floating on a drowsy river,
&lt;br&gt;''A lonely boat would sail along,
&lt;br&gt;''While far away some rousing song
&lt;br&gt;''Or plaintive horn would make us shiver.
&lt;br&gt;''But sweeter still, amid such nights,
&lt;br&gt;''Are [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]'s octaves' soaring flights.
&lt;/div&gt;

For the first edition of this chapter, the poet commissioned an illustration depicting him and Onegin walking together along the quay. Upon receiving the illustration, which represented him leaning on a parapet with his back turned towards the Peter and Paul Fortress, he was exceedingly displeased with the result (which had little in common with his own preliminary sketch, illustrated to the right) and scribbled the following [[epigram]] underneath:

&lt;div style="font-size:90%"&gt;
&lt;br&gt; ''Here, after crossing Bridge Kokushkin,
&lt;br&gt; ''With bottom on the granite propped,
&lt;br&gt; ''Stands Aleksandr Sergeich Pushkin;
&lt;br&gt; ''Near M'sieur Onegin he has stopped.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; ''Ignoring with a look superior
&lt;br&gt; ''The [[Peter and Paul Fortress|fateful Power's citadel]],
&lt;br&gt; ''On it he turns a proud posterior:
&lt;br&gt; ''My dear chap, poison not the well!''
&lt;/div&gt;

(translated by [[Vladimir Nabokov]])

'''''Primetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV''''' is a 2011 book by political commentator [[Ben Shapiro]]. In it he argues that [[TV producer|producers]], executives and [[screenwriting|writers]] in the [[entertainment industry]] are using [[television]] to promote a [[Socialism|socialist]] political agenda.

==Content==
As one part of the evidence, Shapiro presents statements from taped interviews made by celebrities and TV show creators from Hollywood whom he interviewed for the book. The book include quotes from, among others, the co-creator of ''[[Friends]]'', [[Marta Kauffman]], and the creator of ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' and ''[[the Golden Girls]]'', [[Susan Harris]]. Another argument is that [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] are shunned in the industry.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/02/us-hollywood-idUSTRE7517JQ20110602 |title= TV executives confirm Hollywood's liberal agenda |author= Paul Bond |date= June 2, 2011|work= |publisher= Reuters |access-date=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Vin Di Bona]], a producer responsible for many hit television shows, agreed during an interview with Shapiro that Hollywood promotes a liberal political agenda, commenting, "I'm happy about it, actually." Di Bona also said that ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'', the cult hit show on which he was a producer, promoted an [[anti-gun movement]] position, as the character of MacGyver does not use a gun, but rather his own intelligence. People involved with television shows ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' and ''[[Happy Days]]'' told Shapiro that they possessed [[pacifistic]] and anti-[[Vietnam War]] agendas.&lt;ref name="The Data Lounge"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/sesame-streets-pinko-puppets-brainwash-our-kids-2290418.html |title=Sesame Street's pinko puppets brainwash our kids |author=Guy Adams | publisher = The Independent |date=May 29, 2011 |access-date=June 15, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the television show ''[[Sesame Street]]'' which is accused of deliberately spreading left-wing propaganda to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/elmo_really_pinko_ppKu2hreGFpo4QFm8PG9DO|title=Elmo's really a pinko|last=Fagen|first=Cynthia R.|date=May 31, 2011|publisher=''[[New York Post]]''|access-date=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer [[Leonard Goldberg]] stated to Shapiro that in the industry liberalism is "100 percent dominant, and anyone who denies it is kidding, or not telling the truth", and when Shapiro asked if politics are a barrier to entry replied, "Absolutely".

Producer and director [[Nicholas Meyer]] replied "Well, I hope so," when asked if conservatives are discriminated against, and stated regarding the 1983 made-for-TV film ''[[The Day After]]'' that, "My private, grandiose notion was that this movie would unseat [[Ronald Reagan]] when he ran for re-election."

Executive [[Fred Silverman]] stated regarding TV comedy nowadays that "...there’s only one perspective, and it’s a very progressive perspective. And if you want the other perspective... well it's just not there right now."

TV series ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'' creator [[John Langley]] stated that he prefers showing segments where whites are the criminals because he fears that he would be promoting negative stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tv-executives-admit-taped-interviews-193116 Paul Bond, "TV Executives Admit in Taped Interviews That Hollywood Pushes a Liberal Agenda" (Exclusive Video), June 1, 2011, ''The Hollywood Reporter'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Shapiro states that he was "...shocked by the openness of the Hollywood crowd when it came to admitting anti-conservative discrimination inside the industry".&lt;ref name="The Data Lounge"/&gt; He argues that [[nepotism]] in Hollywood rarely is familial, but rather is ideological by friends hiring friends with the same ideological views:&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; "The same people who talk about tolerance and diversity have no tolerance for ideological diversity."&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt; He also states: "...the liberal content we see on primetime television and in daytime soaps is typically hidden in plot and character...I go through probably 100 shows in detail in Primetime Propaganda – and virtually all of them are messaged, either blatantly or subtly."&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;

Portions of some of the interviews which were released onto the internet to promote the book, particularly the Di Bona interview, caused director and producer [[Lionel Chetwynd]] to resign from the [[Caucus for Producers, Writers &amp; Directors]]. In an open letter, he wrote about the reaction of other members of the caucus to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] politicians: "In preparing his book, Mr. Shapiro interviewed a large number of our Hollywood notables on the subject of diversity -- not the sacrosanct melange of race, religion, gender orientation and the like, but a more challenging diversity: that of opinion and policy. The vast majority felt quite comfortable endorsing discrimination against those whose political philosophy was not rooted in the reflexive Leftism of Hollywood," and "I knew most of my fellow members looked upon the political positions of these people as distasteful; what I now understand is the disgust was not for their views, but for their very person".&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118038054 |title= TV tome: Left has heft |author= Ted Johnson |date= June 6, 2011 |work= |publisher= Variety |access-date=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument by Shapiro is that Hollywood has overemphasized the importance of the 18–49-year-old market for advertisers. Initially, as admitted by executives during the taped interviews, this view was promoted by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the late 1960s since the [[television network|network]] had poor ratings and needed to increase advertising revenue in some way.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/269181/switching-tv-right-interview|title=Page not found|author=|date=June 15, 2011|website=National Review|access-date=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shapiro argues that the situation may change quickly in the future since new technologies, such as content delivered by the Internet, may dramatically change the media landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/06/primetime_propaganda.html Carol A. Taber, "Primetime Propaganda", June 2, 2011, ''American Thinker'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interview techniques===
Shapiro explained how he was able to interview numerous celebrities for the book: "I...told them I was profiling the biggest names in Hollywood over the last 50 years...They must have assumed that with a name like Shapiro and a [[Harvard Law]] credential, there was no need to Google; I would have to be a leftist.  When I spoke with them, I used certain liberal code words – 'social justice,' 'tolerance,' 'diversity.'  And they spoke freely with me, with permission to tape."&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frontpagemag.com/2011/05/31/primetime-propaganda/ |title=Primetime Propaganda Interview with Ben Shapiro |author= Jamie Glazov|date= May 31, 2011 |access-date=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vin Di Bona stood by the statements quoted from his interview but added that the material "was obtained in a duplicitous manner", accusing Shapiro of misrepresenting the nature of his book prior to interview.&lt;ref name="Variety"/&gt; Marta Kauffman said that "The idea that we are pushing an agenda is nonsense," adding that "...the dangerous thing about the book is it implies we don't want a dialogue."&lt;ref name="Variety"/&gt; Another of the interviewees, [[George Schlatter]], rejected suggestions that Hollywood is conspiring to exclude the conservative perspective and accused the right wing of being "guilty of everything they accuse the left wing of".&lt;ref name="Variety"/&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewing the book and interviewing Shapiro, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reporter Patrick Goldstein questioned Shapiro citing ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' as examples, as Goldstein argued those shows have ..."gone over like gangbusters with middle America."&lt;ref name="LAT 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstein|first=Patrick|title='Propaganda' is hard to prove|url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2011/jun/13/news/sns-lat-propaganda-hard-to-prove-20110613|accessdate=June 27, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project Gutenberg Australia''', abbreviated as '''PGA''', is an [[Internet]] site which was founded in 2001 by Colin Choat. It is a sister site of [[Project Gutenberg]], though there is no formal relationship between the two organizations. The site hosts free [[ebook]]s or [[e-text]]s which are in the [[public domain]] in [[Australia]]. Volunteers have prepared and submitted the ebooks.

To complement the extensive amount of original source material available in the form of ebooks, a great deal of information about the [[History of Australia|history]] and the [[European maritime exploration of Australia|exploration of Australia]] is provided, together with a "Library of Australiana", a list of ebooks available about Australia or written by Australians.

Because of differences between [[Australian copyright law|Australian]] and [[United States copyright law|United States]] (where Project Gutenberg is based) [[copyright law]], Project Gutenberg Australia contains many works not available in Project Gutenberg, including works by [[Margaret Mitchell]], [[George Orwell]], [[Ayn Rand]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Edgar Wallace]], [[S. S. Van Dine]] and [[Dylan Thomas]].

With the introduction of the [[U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement]], works of authors who died after 31 December 1954 will now not enter the public domain in Australia until at least 1 January 2026. However, all such works which were already public domain under Australian law as of the end of 2004 remain in the public domain, and thus continue to be hosted at Project Gutenberg of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gutenberg.net.au/newsandreviews.html Project Gutenberg Australia, News and Reviews], section ''Changes to Australian Copyright Law''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regional Theatre of the Palouse''' ('''RTOP''') is an established non-profit theater company based in [[Pullman, Washington]]. It was founded in 2007 by award winning Managing Artistic Director John Rich. Its mission statement explains its goal: "make a positive difference in the [[Palouse|Palouse region]] by providing an outlet for creative expression through theater arts". RTOP provides theatrical entertainment in the form of [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[Musical theatre|musicals]], and theater workshops. It acts as a safe and trusting outlet for actors, directors, producers, and stage technicians of all ages who live in the region. Productions occur primarily in the RTOP Theatre, past performances have been held at [[Beasley Coliseum|Beasley Performing Arts Coliseum]] and venues across the Palouse.

==History==

In February, 2007, Regional Theatre of the Palouse launched its web site. The news of a new theater company spread quickly. ''The Wizard of Oz'', RTOP's first production, premiered August 24, 2007, in [[Beasley Coliseum]].&lt;ref name="Moscow Pullman Daily News"&gt;[http://www.nwmarket.com/index.php?page=search&amp;mode=3&amp;byline=&amp;pubdate=&amp;enddate=&amp;s=RTOP&amp;Submit=Search Northwest Market - Lewiston, Clarkston, Moscow and Pullman Classified Listings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, a Musical Review was held at a local venue, under the title ''Oktoberfest'', where songs from different musicals were performed live and German food was served to the audience.

In 2008 the Regional theatre converted a historic storefront property in downtown Pullman, intro the RTOP Theatre.  The premiere performance [[Seussical the Musical]] opened in April.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnews.com/archived-story/Pulse---A&amp;E/80077/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="771">The term '''seriolithograph''' is used by [[Park West Gallery]], a major publisher of graphic editions. The term is used to distinguish a form of hybrid [[fine art]] printing technique. Seriolithographs are a combination of [[lithography]] (offset, stochastic, photo-mechanical or continuous tone) with [[serigraphy]], a fine art stencil printing technique.  Although the term is used by Park West Gallery most commonly, Park West is not the only gallery that publishes or represents these types of hybrid prints. Fine art prints of this type are published by numerous artists and publishers worldwide, and are widely accepted and collected.

The '''[[Saint Michael|St. Michael]]'s Church''' ({{lang-ro|Biserica Sfântul Mihail}}, {{lang-hu|Szent Mihály-templom}}) is a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic-style]] [[Romanian Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church in [[Cluj-Napoca]]. It is the second largest church (after the [[Black Church]] of [[Brașov]]) in the geographical region of [[Transylvania]], [[Romania]]. The nave is 50 meters long and 24 meters wide, the apse is 20&amp;times;10 m. The tower with its height of 76 meter (80 meter including the cross) is the highest one in Transylvania. The western portal is decorated with the three [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] as [[King of Hungary]], as [[King of Bohemia]] and as [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

The construction was begun probably in place of the [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] Chapel. The financing of the church was partly done by the citizens, partly from the income of indulgences. (The first related document from 1349, signed by the archbishop of [[Avignon]] and fifteen other bishops grants the indulgence for those contributing to the illumination and furniture of the Saint Michael Church.) The construction was completed between 1442-1447, the old tower was built between 1511-1545. The tower that stands today was erected in 1862.

The church was converted with the population to Protestantism between 1545-1566. Then the more radical [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] patry took it over in the period 1566-1716. At last, it was confiscated in the [[counter reformation]] by the [[Habsburg]] government supported Catholic Church.

The oldest of its sections is the [[altar]], inaugurated in 1390, while the newest part is the [[clock tower]], which was built in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style (1837-1862).

Some important historical events that took place in the church:
* 26 July 1551: [[Isabella Jagiełło|Queen Isabella of Hungary]] gives the [[Hungarian Crown]] to General Castaldo, the deputy of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I.]], and cedes with that Hungary and Transylvania
* 23 October 1556: Queen Isabella returns and takes back the reign of Transylvania, in the name of her son, the child [[John II Sigismund Zápolya]]
* 27 March 1601: the third investiture of [[Sigismund Báthory]] as Prince of Transylvania 
* 12 February 1607: election of [[Sigismund Rákóczi]] as Prince of Transylvania 
* 7 March 1608: election of [[Gabriel Báthory]] as Prince of Transylvania 
* 13 October 1613: election of [[Gabriel Bethlen]] as Prince of Transylvania 
* 18 May 1944: the speech of [[Áron Márton]], bishop of the Roman Catholic Church in Transylvania in which he strongly condemned the deportation of Jews.

'''''Stone City, Iowa''''' is a 1930 painting by the American artist [[Grant Wood]]. It depicts the former [[boomtown]] of [[Stone City, Iowa]]. It was Wood's first major landscape painting. It is a study of a real place with which Wood was thoroughly familiar, but the landscape has been given fantastical curvy shapes, the trees are ornamental, and the bright surfaces are artificially patterned.&lt;ref name="dennis"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dennis|first=James M.|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTvd44RgloMC&amp;pg=PA46|chapter=Grant Wood's Native-Born Modernism|title=Grant Wood: An American Master Revealed|location=|publisher=|p=46|isbn=0-87654-485-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town had been built for its [[limestone]] quarries. When the painting was made, the town was in rapid decline due to the development of [[Portland cement]]. The painting thus depicts the transition from [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] and back to rural community. During the summers of 1932 and 1933, the town became the host of the [[Stone City Art Colony]], which Wood was part of.&lt;ref name="joslyn"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.joslyn.org/collections-and-exhibitions/permanent-collections/american/grant-wood-stone-city-iowa/|title=''Stone City, Iowa'' , 1930|publisher=[[Joslyn Art Museum]]|accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Stone City, Iowa'' was made the same year as Wood's ''[[American Gothic]]'' and both paintings were successes for the artist. Wood promoted his new style under the label of the "new movement".&lt;ref name="dennis" /&gt;

The painting is located at the [[Joslyn Art Museum]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].&lt;ref name="joslyn" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30397">'''Territory bands''' were dance bands that crisscrossed specific regions of the United States from the 1920s through the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Schuller 770-805"/&gt;  Beginning in the 1920s, the bands typically had 8 to 12 musicians.  These bands typically played one-nighters, 6 or 7 nights a week at venues like [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|VFW]] halls, [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks Lodge]]s, [[Lions Club]]s, hotel ballrooms, and the like.  [[Francis Davis]], jazz critic for [[The Village Voice]], likened territory bands to "the [[Top 40]] [[cover bands]] (of the 1970s and 1980s) of their day, typically relying on stock arrangements of other ensembles' hits."  He said, "many historians give much credit to territory bands for popularizing modern [[ballroom dancing]] that began during the [[World War I]] era with the influence of [[Vernon Castle|Vernon and Irene Castle]]."&lt;ref name="Village Voice 2006"/&gt;

Territory bands helped disseminate popular music &amp;mdash; which included swing, jazz, sweet dance music, or any combination thereof &amp;mdash; bringing it to remote gin mills and dance halls that were otherwise ignored by national booking agents representing genuine recording stars like [[Duke Ellington|Ellington]] and [[Louie Armstrong|Armstrong]]. Many developed original repertoires and signature sounds, none more storied than [[Walter Page]]'s [[Oklahoma City Blue Devils|Blue Devils]], the Oklahoma City-based outfit that [[Count Basie]] joined in 1926.&lt;ref name="Village Voice 2006"/&gt;

== Ethnicities of the bands ==
There were black bands and white bands, and bands of various immigrant ethnicities.&lt;ref name="Greene 1992"/&gt; There were also all-female bands, such as the [[International Sweethearts of Rhythm]].

Musician, composer, and scholar [[Gunther Schuller]] asserted in one of his books, ''The Swing Era: The Development of Jazz, 1930–1945 (The History of Jazz, Vol. 2)'' that, "territory bands, by definition, were black.  There were, of course, many white bands in the 'territories' but they tended to have the more lucrative and permanent jobs and therefore not required to travel as much as the black bands."&lt;ref name="Schuller 770-805" /&gt; Another musician (former territory band musician and historian), [[Jack Behrens]], expressed in a book that Schuller's depiction of divergent work conditions was narrow.  "During my playing days in the 1940s and 50s in several white territory bands, we didn't have "lucrative and permanent jobs" unless you count day labor in a dairy bar or clerking at a military surplus store.  Worse, there were times we didn't get paid at all and we had little recourse given the cost of legal advice."&lt;ref name="Behrens"/&gt;

For most territory bands &amp;mdash; whether black, white, integrated, male, female &amp;mdash; the musicians were nearly always paid. Neither the booking agencies nor the musicians got rich, but regular salaries helped maintain pretty decent musicianship.&lt;ref name="Dirk Fischer"/&gt;

Most musicians witnessed and experienced a wide variety of [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] practices, from city to city and region to region.  One common present-day misconception is that Jim Crow practices were more prevalent in the South.  The practices were prevalent everywhere, especially in New York City&lt;ref name="Fronc"/&gt; and the Midwest.  The bands that were racially integrated commonly experienced problems, mostly from having to dodge different applications and degrees of Jim Crow among cities and regions.  Many bands, especially The [[International Sweethearts of Rhythm]], handled some of the absurdities with a degree of inward, sarcastic humor.  When musicians grew wary or even felt vulnerable to injustices of Jim Crow, the band bus, for those who had one, served as a safe haven.

==History==
The published history of territory bands is thin.  Most of what we know comes from fading memories and second-hand anecdotes.  With a lack of discography and the passing of a generation, our knowledge is slipping. While many territory bands were of high quality, they rarely recorded and were often unfairly considered minor league to the national touring bands.  Moreover, they were confined to specific regions or states … even parts of a state.&lt;ref name="Behrens" /&gt;  Ambitious and hopeful young musicians saw territory bands as a training ground for, or rite of passage to, the major big bands.  The alumni of territory band musicians who matriculated to fame within the industry reads like list of "who's who" in music.

Territory bands typically played more sweet music, though, some in the mid 1950s, particularly those with talented musicians, managed to entertain dancers with a jazzier sound.  But dancing audiences are what kept the bands employed.  In the 1920s, territory bands commonly traveled by car ([[station wagon]]), followed by an equipment truck for the [[PA system]], [[guitar amplifier]]s and [[drum kit]].  Later, beginning in the mid-1930s, territory bands commonly traveled in sleeper trailers.

== Established territories ==
Home territories were loosely defined, but some classifications emerged. Generally, the areas were defined as Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, West Coast, Southwest and Northwest. In addition, some state-groupings became common.

; MINK
MINK was a particularly distinguished state group. It was composed of [[Minnesota]], [[Iowa]], [[Nebraska]] and [[Kansas]].

; VSA 
VSA was composed of [[Virginia]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Alabama]].&lt;ref name="TB DB"/&gt;

; Southwest
The [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] proved especially fertile for territory bands.  [[Texas]], with its spread-out geography and relatively large population, offered the greatest opportunity with developed markets for dance music in [[Dallas-Fort Worth]], [[Houston, TX|Houston]], [[San Antonio]], [[Austin, TX|Austin]], [[Amarillo]], and other cities.  The homegrown audiences of Texas bands were so plentiful that the bands developed to a high degree in relative isolation from outside influences.&lt;ref name="Gioia"/&gt;  One such band was that of [[Alphonso Trent]].

; West Coast
Bands out of Los Angeles and Seattle performed not only in California, Oregon, and Washington, but also Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana.  The Glenn Henry Orchestra, which got its first big break playing summers at Yellowstone Park from 1935 to 1940, became a popular West Coast territory band.

; Military circuits
There were military territories, too — [[Non-commissioned officer#United States|NCO]] Clubs, Officers' Clubs.  These clubs took bands to [[Greenland]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Bermuda]], [[Puerto Rico]], as well as the US.

==Styles==
The musicians in the territory dance bands were primarily jazz musicians. Despite the overwhelming view that [[New Orleans]] was the cradle of jazz, the itinerant musicians were the ones who first disseminated it.

The dancing public could actually dance and they knew which bands swung and which simply just played well.  Audiences responded with great enthusiasm to the black bands in the Midwest. The East Coast black bands were popular in the 1920s; but "Swing" came to that region in the form of [[Louis Armstrong]] joining the [[Fletcher Henderson]] band when he went to the [[New York City|Big Apple]].

Territory bands were not all swing bands. The Midwest settlements of Europeans of various ethnicities brought their community dancing and revelry with them in the form of very popular polka bands (and also old time [[waltzes]], leandlers, and [[schottische]]s).&lt;ref name="Greene 1992"/&gt;  They played at all the ballrooms, Elk Clubs, and the like as well.  Here's a short exemplary list:

:[http://www.internationalpolka.com/fritsche.htm Fezz Fritsche] &amp; His Goose-town Band
:The [[Six Fat Dutchmen]]
:The Babe Wagner Band (Babe later played jazz trombone with the [[Gene Krupa|Krupa]] band)
:[http://www.whoopeejohn.com/ Whoopie John] &amp;mdash; a very successful and famous polka band from Minneapolis

==Pre 1920s==
There were traveling bands well before the 1920s &amp; 30s.  One of many examples were musicians who did their booking from [[Redfield, South Dakota]]. Redfield was a railroad hub in the [[Northern Plains]]. All their booking was up and down the rail line.

==1920s &amp;mdash; swing and ballroom dancing==
In 1924, according to [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], there were more than 900 dance bands, representing steady work for 7,200 musicians.  There were 68 [[Paul Whiteman|Whiteman]] orchestras across the country, playing music from the Whiteman library, eleven in New York alone.  In the mid-20s, bands typically had ten musicians: two [[alto saxophone|altos]], one [[tenor saxophone|tenor]] (who often doubled on other [[woodwinds]] and sometimes [[violin]]), two [[trumpet]]s, [[trombone]], [[banjo]] or [[guitar]], [[piano]], [[string bass]] or [[tuba|brass bass]], and drums.  Sometimes there were two trombones.  If the band had only two saxophones, they would be alto and tenor.

==1933 &amp;mdash; Great Depression==
The [[Great Depression]], which hit bottom in 1933, was hard on territory bands.  The public strained to afford entertainment.  It was not uncommon for bands to be stranded for lack of funds.  Many broke up during this period.

==1940s &amp;mdash; decline ==
There are many theories on why swing music and territory bands declined.  Here are a few:
#Unions restricted the fees of booking agents and managers.
#Unions required visiting bands to pay local musicians for displaced work (in small towns, unions were nonexistent; but in large cities, unions often looked askance upon territory bands).
#Popularity of small combos
#Commercial Radio (introduced in 1922), better-quality gramophone discs, and TV (giving greater access to entertainment in the home and access to different types of music).  Changing technology (radio, TV, mobility, amplified music) shocked the music industry in a similar way that the [[internet]] has shocked the recording industry today.
#In the 1950s, most ballrooms in smaller towns of the Midwest closed because people could drive to the city for everything.
#Record companies discovered &amp;mdash; during the AFM recording bans of 1942-43 and 1948 — that they could profit from record sales, churning out [[Hit Parade]] music with just singers, who were exempt from the recording bans.  This marked a period when singers became more popular than bandleaders.  The introduction and technological advancement of amplification and gramophone recording led to the development of [[crooning]], an intimate vocal style perfected by singers such as [[Bing Crosby]] and, later, [[Frank Sinatra]].  The record companies gained control over what got recorded; therefore music that was slated for a new market of teenagers was born.  This destroyed several booking agencies. [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]], who broke up as many bands as it booked, moved to [[Hollywood]]. Frederic Bros. ([[Chicago]]) had a fallout with several of its bands.&lt;ref name="Billboard 1948"/&gt;  The Vic Schroeder Agency (Omaha), was one of the more responsible bookers before [[World War II]] but, little is known after &amp;mdash; same with the White Agency.&lt;ref name="Dirk Fischer"/&gt;
#Amplification also led to the introduction of the [[electric guitar]], which enabled a very small band to project adequately in large-room settings.  Bear in mind that, in the 1920s, an unamplified orchestra had to be large enough and play loud enough to entertain a dance hall of 3,000. Prior to the recording bans, the industry was bent on capturing the intent of composers as interpreted by musicians.  Before the ban, gramophone consumers were primarily interested in authenticity of symphonies and famous orchestras (dance bands).  Vocals, with no microphones, were only an incidental part of an arrangement. Vocals &amp;mdash; like Bing Crosby's with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra in the studio — could not be replicated live, on stage.  [[Rudy Vallée]] used a cheerleader's [[megaphone]]. Amplification and the record industry helped spur technical improvements, at the expense of performing musicians.

==All-girl territory bands==
In the history of traveling dance bands, all female bands are often excluded, or only given minor inclusion. Popular culture seemed to regard the musical performances dance bands provided as an area meant to be dominated by men. In the scenarios where women were allowed to join in, they were often denoted as separate. This is seen in the way many female singers were nicknamed “canaries,” denoting them not as musicians, but as pretty objects meant to be on display.  One example that shows just how foreign women could be considered appears in the name of a band [[Mary Lou Williams]] headed that was called "Six Men and a Girl."&lt;ref name="Antoinette"/&gt; Oftentimes these stereotypes surrounding performing women extended to instrumentalists.

All female performers were not a new idea in the dawn of traveling jazz bands though. All women groups performing American genres of music dates back to minstrel groups like Madame Rentz’s Female Minstrels. Because women could not easily enter prestigious music bands that were essentially all male, all women groups continuously popped up as groups that allowed skilled female musicians to perform. Sometimes they were put together with help from outside sources. It was not uncommon for a group to be put together by a man or a talent agency, but to consist of all female performers. Sometimes performers received aide from family or friends involved in the business to help get their foot in the door. For instance, [[Lil Hardin Armstrong]] had an all woman dance band in the early 1930s.  This group went by such names as "Lil Armstrong and Her Swing Band."&lt;ref name="Dahl"/&gt;  Other bands popular in the 1930s include [[The Harlem Playgirls]], The Dixie Sweethearts, the [[Darlings of Rhythm]], and Gertrude Long and Her Rambling Night Hawks.&lt;ref name="Antoinette"/&gt;

Even banding together with other women though, public perception would sometimes view all female bands as “all-girl gimmicks.” Some talented musicians avoided joining all female bands in the fear that their talent would be disregarded in such a context.&lt;ref name="Dahl"/&gt;  Yet all female bands were also forced into the feminine appearances they were also demeaned for. In many ways, this made being in a traveling dance band more difficult for women than it had been for men. After a night spent traveling women were expected to be visions of beauty with perfect make up, hair, and personalities. Often the ultra feminine clothes they had to wear, such as strapless dress and high heels, also affected their ability to play and perform. As had been shown in previous attempts women had made to broach men’s groups, attempting to break away from this dainty female image could call the sexuality and morality of a performer into question. Yet women’s performances were also often debased to their visual looks and sexual attractiveness, even though many reviewers criticized them for these elements.&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt;

A certain need to prove themselves seemed to exist among many of the female musicians who worked in dance bands. These performers inherited a lot of the stereotypes that surrounded their previous female performer counterparts: chorus line girls and girl singers. The sexual objectification of women that haunted those two careers was also a part of being in an all female band. Furthermore, chorus line girls had an association with loose morals and even prostitution, and loss of face for an instrumentalist could mean the end of a career.  These kinds of associations also made many people assume that female instrumentalists were not talented players. Upon interviewing later in life, many women insisted that they were talented musicians who knew how to play. This insistence seems to be in direct reaction to the claims that circulated that female musicians were not meant to play well but simply to look pretty. While it’s true that many agencies required photos in their applications to join female bands, the musicians in them still tended to be quite talented.&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt;

While many people view the end of the Swing era as the opening of World War II, this was not the case for all woman dance bands. Instead, they flourished during the 1940s. Swing music became a form of patriotism to a country at war. The all-girl bands that did the best at this time tended to be groups formed before American involvement in the war. Once it was realized that women could fill a major hole in the entertainment industry and that they could not be drafted, agencies and managers everywhere began trying to put together all female bands. In many ways, these musicians were very prepared to take over for the men because they had more advanced experience in playing instruments, either from hobbies or school bands. They were certainly more prepared for musical performance than many women were prepared for welding and factory work. Some groups connected to academic organizations, such as the [[International Sweethearts of Rhythm]] or the [[Prairie View Co-eds]] did very well at this time. These groups of industrious young women could come to represent an image of what the United States was at war for. Some of these groups even did USO tours. Soldiers shipped off to foreign lands, under the pressure war and deprived of any female presence were more than welcoming to these all woman groups. The armed audiences were known to have shown extreme appreciation for these female performers&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt;  [[V-discs]], recorded for broadcast on the Armed Forces Radio Network, often featured all-girl groups.

'''''The New Radical''''' is a 2017 documentary film that premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in the US Documentary Competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6333062/|title=The New Radical|date=1 December 2017|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, uncompromising millennial radicals from the United States and the United Kingdom attack the system through dangerous technological means, which evolves into a high-stakes game with world authorities in the midst of a dramatically changing political landscape. The film contains an interview with [[Julian Assange]] at the Ecuadoran Embassy in London.

== Critical response ==
Owen Gleiberman writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "The great strength of ''The New Radical'' is that it's not on its subjects' side (or totally against them either). It's the rare documentary that lets you decide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/the-new-radical-review-1201967572/|title=Sundance Film Review: ‘The New Radical’|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|date=24 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Katie Walsh in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film's objectivity "irresponsible" and "problematic," chastising the filmmakers for not taking a side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-capsule-new-radical-review-20171130-story.html|title=Documentary 'The New Radical' perilously withholds judgment|first=Katie|last=Walsh|website=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tim Lowly''' (born 1958 in Hendersonville, North Carolina) is a Chicago artist, musician, and teacher.  He is known for compassionate [[egg tempera]] pictures of children in mysterious circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Alan G. Artner, "Grabner Homes in on Subject Matter: Lanyon Exhibit Combines the Past with the Present, While Lowly Mixes Figures with Landscapes", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Thursday, May 27, 1999, section 5, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Tim Lowly was born Tim Grubbs.  From the age of three he lived in [[South Korea]], where his parents were [[Presbyterian]] [[missionaries]].  He learned piano and guitar and still plays and composes [[folk-rock]] music.  Lowly attended [[Calvin College]] in [[Grand Rapids]], Michigan, majoring in art.  He married Sherrie Rubingh in 1981, and rather than subordinate anyone's last name, they changed their surname to Lowly.&lt;ref name=Camper&gt;Fred Camper, "Temma Lowly and the Meaning of Life", ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', Friday, November 22, 2002, Vol. 32, no. 8, pp. 1, 14–20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After a visit to Korea and Europe, Lowly took up the exacting [[renaissance]] art of [[egg tempera]] painting, in which egg yolk is mixed with pigment to make paint.

The Lowlys had a daughter, Temma, in 1985, who was brain-damaged and is frequently the subject of Mr. Lowly's paintings.  Lowly says, "Part of my fairly political agenda is to say that [[disabled]] children are a part of life.  These are not freaks.  What I'm saying is that we should advocate for eyes of compassion that see human beings as human beings, rather than separating them into the beautiful, the ugly, the normal, the freak."&lt;ref name=Camper/&gt;

Lowly has been awarded an Individual Artist Grant from the Michigan Council for the Arts in 1987 and Fellowships in Visual Art from the [[Illinois Arts Council]] in 1995 and 2005.  He teaches at [[North Park University]] in Chicago.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4741">'''West-East Bag''' ('''WEB''') was an international [[women artists]] network active from 1971 to 1973.

West-East Bag formed towards the beginning of the [[feminist art movement in the United States]]. Sources differ as to the exact origin of WEB. In one account, artists [[Judy Chicago]] and [[Miriam Schapiro]] formed the idea with art critic [[Lucy R. Lippard]] in April 1971 after visiting the exhibition ''26 Women Artists''. A second account places ''New York Times'' art writer [[Grace Glueck]] at the formation and a third has Chicago and Schapiro meeting Lippard, [[Marcia Tucker]] and [[Ellen Lanyon]] during a lecture trip.&lt;ref name="Moravec"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moravec|first1=Michelle|title=Toward A History Of Feminism, Art, And Social Movements In The United States|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|date=2012|volume=33|issue=2|pages=22–54|jstor=10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.2.0022|doi=10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.2.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lippard recalls mentioning East Coast Bag while talking to Chicago, who replied "ah ha, if you're going to say East Coast Bag then we're going to call it West East Bag instead of East West Bag, because the west coast came first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lucy Lippard|journal=Profile|date=1981|volume=1-2|publisher=Video Data Bank, School/Art Institute Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote box

A group that is locally effective can be doubly powerful if it synchronizes its actions with those of other groups across the country. We can gain from each other's experiences and make more headway together if we are aware of each other's activities in time to echo or support them.

}}
In 1971, West-East Bag published the first issue of their newsletter ''W.E.B.'' to link efforts in their home cities. The inaugural issue made mention of tactics used against museums to protest the lack of women artists in their collections and exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Moravec"/&gt; Schapiro (Los Angeles), Lippard (New York), and [[Ellen Lanyon]] (Chicago) tooks turns producing the then-monthly newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Love|editor1-first=Barbara J.|title=Feminists who Changed America, 1963-1975|date=2006|publisher=Univ. of Illinois Press|location=Urbana, Ill.|isbn=0-252-03189-X|page=269|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kpNarH7t9CkC&amp;lpg=PA439&amp;dq=west%20east%20bag&amp;pg=PA269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[Ad Hoc Women Artists' Committee]] before them, the group encouraged chapters to set up slide registries of women artists.&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Meredith A.|title='The Enemies of Women's Liberation in the Arts Will be Crushed': A.I.R. Gallery's Role in the American Feminist Art Movement|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/essay/meredith-brown|publisher=Archives of American Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; WEB slide registries were created in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and Seattle. WEB members also held [[consciousness raising]] sessions and organized protests of their local art institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lippard|first1=Lucy R.|editor1-last=Ault|editor1-first=Julie|title=Alternative Art, New York, 1965&amp;ndash;1985: A Cultural Politics Book for the Social Text Collective|date=2002|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=0-8166-3794-6|page=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZzxqQqQk94C&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;ots=CUEbg2Hr8e&amp;dq=%22West-East%20Bag%22&amp;pg=PA96|chapter=Biting the Hand: Artists and Museums in New York since 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local chapters such as Boston and Chicago published their own WEB newsletters, sponsored conferences, and organized monthly meetings. By April 1972, Chicago's WEB chapter had sponsored a series of conferences that led to the formation of feminist arts organizations across the Midwest.&lt;ref name="Moravec"/&gt;  WEB members in Chicago organized the first women artists' conference there, ''Artists Meet'' in Spring 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardenburgh|first1=Linn|last2=Duchon|first2=Susan|title=In Retrospect &amp;ndash; The Midwest Women Artists' Conference|journal=Art Journal|date=Summer 1976|volume=35|issue=4|page=386|jstor=776233|doi=10.1080/00043249.1976.10793312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West-East Bag laid the foundation for a series of cooperatively run women's galleries, starting with [[A.I.R. Gallery]] in 1972. West-East Bag grew to include representatives from 52 cities and eight countries. By 1973, WEB ceased being active on a national level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9459">The '''William E. Harmon Foundation Award for Distinguished Achievement among Negroes''', commonly referred to as the '''Harmon Award''' or '''Harmon Foundation Award''', was a philanthropic and cultural award created in 1926 by [[William E. Harmon]]&lt;ref name = "GH3"&gt;Gates &amp; Higginbotham, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and administered by the [[William E. Harmon Foundation|Harmon Foundation]]. It was offered for distinguished achievements in eight different fields: literature, music, fine arts, business and industry (such as banker [[Anthony Overton]] in 1927), science and innovation, education (for example, educator [[Janie Porter Barrett]] in 1929), religious service, and  race relations.

Although awards were created in eight categories, it is best known for its impact on [[African-American art]] of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], and particularly on the visual arts. During its existence the Harmon award was largely considered synonymous with Negro visual art:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...the introduction of the Harmon foundation awards in 1926, which were always dispensed with a flurry of publicity, marked the beginning of a new era for Negro visual art. With its private endowment, popular social mission, and interracial alliances, [it] possessed a much  greater public relations capacity than any other prior initiatives....Due in large part to the activities of the Harmon Foundation, African Americans emerged as a distinct presence in the American art world.&lt;ref name = "Calo75"&gt;Calo, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the [[List of winners of the William E. Harmon foundation award for distinguished achievement among Negroes|many recipients of the awards]] in literature and the fine arts were [[Claude McKay]], [[Hale Woodruff]], [[Palmer Hayden]], [[Archibald Motley]] (his winning piece was ''The Octoroon Girl''), [[Countee Cullen]] and [[Langston Hughes]].

The awards were closely associated with an annual ''Exhibition of the Work of Negro Artists'', conceived by Mary Brady. Exhibitions were held in 1927 through 1931, 1933, and 1935, and featured "substantial prizes" together with gold, silver and bronze medals.&lt;ref&gt;Gates and Higginbotham, p. 3; Driskell, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gates and Higginbotham, "...submissions in the fine arts category was the chief venue open to African American artists"&lt;ref name = "GH3"/&gt;

Awards were given solely on the basis of achievements in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;"Negro Advancement" (December 9, 1926). ''New York Times'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The first year the awards were granted (1926) the judges of the awards proposed giving  Gold award for literature to [[Charles W. Chesnutt]], "...to acknowledge his pioneering work and continuing example to other African American writers". Their intention was to waive the requirement that the award be granted solely for works completed during the previous year. However, the Harmon Foundation did not accept this proposal, and Chesnutt never learned of this "acknowledgment of high esteem from a distinguished panel of his literary peers both black and white."&lt;ref&gt;Gates &amp; Higginbotham, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recipients of the award in every field except race relations were required to be African American&lt;ref&gt;"Judges selected for Negro awards: Leaders in all branches will bestow second annual Harmon Prizes" (July 5, 1927). ''New York Times'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; – the latter could be awarded to "...any person of American residence, regardless of color, who has made an outstanding contribution toward improving relations between the white and Negro people in America."&lt;ref&gt;"Wilbur to present award to Moton: Tuskegee Head Will Get Harmon Medal for Negro Racial Relations Work Tuesday" (April 18, 1930). ''New York Times'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus [[Robert Russa Moton]] was the first African American to receive the race relations award (in 1930). He was preceded by [[Will W. Alexander]] in 1927, and a dual award to [[Julius Rosenwald]] and [[James Hardy Dillard]] in 1928, all of whom who were Caucasian.&lt;ref name = "winners1929"&gt;"Dr. Moton receives $1,000 Harmon Award" (January 6, 1930). ''New York Times'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wintz &amp; Finkelman, p. 1940"&gt;Wintz &amp; Finkelman, p. 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gold and Bronze medals were awarded in the various categories. The Gold carried a $400 cash prize (adjusted for inflation, the 1926 prize would be worth ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|400|1926|r=2}}}} in the US dollars of {{CURRENTYEAR}}; the 1933 prize ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|400|1933|r=2}}}}); the Bronze prize was $100. The award for race relations had a much larger honorarium: it varied between $500 and $1,000.

A description of the Bronze medal won by [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|A.M.E.]] Bishop [[John Fletcher Hurst|John Hurst]] in 1926 appeared in the January 8, 1927, edition of the Baltimore, Maryland ''[[Afro-American (newspaper)|Afro-American]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The medal is of unusually beautiful design. On the obverse side is embossed a ship in full sail on the open sea with the inscription "Harmon Foundation" around the margin. On the reverse side are the words "Inspiration, Achievement Religious Service. Second award, 1926, John Hurst".&lt;ref name = "afroam"&gt;"Bishop Hurst formally given Harmon Award". ''Afro-American'', Saturday, January 8, 1927, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Administered during its first five years (1926–33) by Dr. [[George E. Haynes]],&lt;ref&gt;Calo, pp. 115–16.&lt;/ref&gt; the awards program was discontinued in 1933, which would have been the year of the 1932 awards. However, no awards had been granted in the previous year. A ''[[New York Times]]'' article in 1931 described the race relation category of the awards as "biennial".

A full [[List of winners of the William E. Harmon foundation award for distinguished achievement among Negroes|list of the winners]] of each year was offered in contemporary ''New York Times'' articles.&lt;ref name="winners1929"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "winners1926"&gt;"Negro artist wins prize for paintings" (December 8, 1926).

The '''Workers Film and Photo League''' was an organization of filmmakers, photographers, writers and projectionists in the 1930s, dedicated to using film and photography for social change.

== History ==

Founded in 1930, the WFPL produced documentaries of the U.S. Labor Movement including the National Hunger marches of 1931 and 1932 and the Bonus March 1932. These newsreels were generally not distributed to mainstream theaters, but shown at party or trade union events.  When shown in theaters, they often opened for films produced in Europe or the Soviet Union.  In New York, the "Harry Alan Potamkin Film School" was established by the Workers Film and Photo League to train working-class filmmakers.

Initially affiliated with the [[Workers International Relief]], the group first organized to project films at fundraising events for striking workers.

Although the best known chapter of the WFPL was in New York, groups in Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, and other cities created and screened documentaries under the "Film and Photo League" moniker.  Nationally, the Film &amp; Photo Leagues emerged as a loosely knit alliance of local organizations that provided leftist visual propaganda. Their efforts during the years of the early Depression helped to define social documentary film and photography as a genre.

Much has been made of the association of the Workers Film and Photo League with the Communist Party, both in the US and abroad. While many members were self identified Marxists and party members, the groups usually functioned independently.  They were largely composed of idealists who saw the documentary film as a vital element of the movement for radical social change.

In 1933 "Workers" was dropped from the title and the New York organization became the Film and Photo League. The FPL survived for another year in New York, where its photographers formed the [[Photo League]]. Some filmmakers formed an independent private production company, others founded Nykino and some, later, the Frontier Film Group.

In other cities, such as Chicago and Los Angeles, Film and Photo League activities continued throughout the 1930s.

Although many of the films produced by the Film and Photo Leagues were destroyed in a 1935 storage fire in New York, some surviving films can be found at the Museum of Modern Art Film Study Center, New York; Film Center, School of the Art Institute of Chicago; and the Library of Congress, Washington D.C.  A filmography was created by researchers in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2018-06-02|title=Film and Photo League Filmography compiled by Russell Campbell and William Alexander|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC14folder/FPhotoFilogy.html|website=www.ejumpcut.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhou Shutao ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 周叔弢) (July 18, 1891, [[Yangzhou]] – February 14, 1984, [[Tianjin]]) was a collector of rare books, an industrialist, and the deputy mayor of Tianjin.
