'''Accord and satisfaction''' is a [[contract law]] concept about the purchase of the release from a [[debt]] obligation. It is one of the methods by which parties to a contract may terminate their agreement. The release is completed by the transfer of valuable [[consideration]] that must not be the actual performance of the obligation itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duke|first1=Jeannie Paterson, Andrew Robertson, Arlen|title=Contract : cases and materials|date=2012|publisher=Thomson Reuters (Professional) Australia Limited|location=Rozelle, N.S.W.|isbn=9780455229461|edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accord is the agreement to discharge the obligation and the satisfaction is the legal "consideration" which binds the parties to the agreement. A valid accord does not discharge the prior contract; instead it suspends the right to enforce it in accordance with the terms of the accord contract, in which satisfaction, or performance of the contract will discharge both contracts (the original and the accord). If the creditor breaches the accord, then the debtor will be able to bring up the existence of the accord in order to enjoin any action against him.

If a person is sued over an alleged debt, that person bears the burden of proving the [[affirmative defense]] of accord and satisfaction.

==Illustration==
{{Contract law}}
Accord and satisfaction is a settlement of an unliquidated debt. For example, a builder is contracted to build a homeowner a garage for $35,000. The contract called for $17,500 prior to starting construction, to disburse $10,000 during various stages of construction, and to make a final payment of $7,500 at completion. At completion, the homeowner complained about inferior work quality and refused to make the final payment. After a mutual settlement agreement, the builder accepted $4,000 as full payment. Thereby, a new contract was formed by offer, acceptance, and consideration. The consideration is that for a $3,500 savings, the homeowner gives up that which he is entitled, a well-constructed garage. The builder gives up his right to full price to avoid suit for inferior performance. When accord and satisfaction has occurred, the homeowner has given up his right to sue for inferior performance, and the builder has given up his right to sue for the full $7,500 due under the original contract.

Another example would be where a lender agrees to lend $100,000 at 5.0% interest for 30 years, and at the closing the loan documents are all drawn up for a loan with a 6.0% interest rate.  If the lender agrees to reduce the closing costs by an extra $1000 and the borrowers agree, then there has been an accord and satisfaction.  If the borrowers later sue for breach of contract, the settlement (offer and acceptance of the $1000) constitutes an accord and satisfaction and is a valid defense to the borrower's lawsuit.

The accord agreement must be transacted on a new agreement. It must therefore have the essential terms of a contract, (parties, subject matter, time for performance, and consideration). If there is a breach of the accord there will be no "satisfaction" which will give rise to a breach of accord. In this instance the non-offending party has the right to sue under either the original contract or the accord agreement.

==Consideration==
In an accord contract it is typical that the consideration supplied is less than bargained for in the original contract. In accord contracts that require an amount of consideration that is less than the original, the consideration must be of a different type, e.g. instead of money, debtor offers a car or a boat.

[[File:Al-Zubayr_Rahma_Mansur.jpg|thumb|Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur Pasha]]
'''Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur''' ({{lang-ar|الزبير رحمة منصور}}) (also '''Sebehr Rahma''', '''Rahama Zobeir'''&lt;ref name="hake"&gt;[[Alfred Egmont Hake|Hake, Alfred Egmont]]. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=vlMDAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=sebehr+pasha The Story of Chinese Gordon]", 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[slave trade]]r in the late 19th century. He later became a [[pasha]] and [[Sudan]]ese governor.

His reputation as a [[wikt:nemesis|nemesis]] of General [[Charles George Gordon|Charles Gordon]] meant he was bestowed a near-mythic status in England, where he was referred to as "the richest and worst", a "Slaver King" "who [had] chained lions as part of his escort".&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, O. E. ''Brave Men and Women Their Struggles, Failures, And Triumphs'', 1884&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lang"&gt;Lang, Jeanie. "[http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=langjean&amp;book=gordon&amp;story=_contents The Story of General Gordon]" circa. 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Born in 1830, Rahma came from the [[Gemaab]] section of the [[Ja'Alin]], an [[Arab]] tribe from Northern Sudan.

He began his large-scale business in 1856, when he left [[Khartoum]] with a small army, to set up a network of trading forts known as ''[[zariba]]s'', focusing his efforts on slave trading and ivory sales. At its height his trading empire, backed by a personal army, controlled much the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]] as well as what are today parts of [[Chad]] and the [[Central African Republic]].

In 1871, at the height of his power, Rahma was visited at his headquarters in [[Deim Zubeir]] by [[Georg Schweinfurth]], who described the slavetrader's court as "little less than princely".&lt;ref&gt;''Heart of Africa'', vol. ii., chap. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isma'il Pasha|Isma'il]] Pasha of Egypt desired control over the region, but Rahma defeated a mercenary army sent against him. Instead in 1873 Isma'il added the region to his empire by acknowledging Rahma's power and granting  him the title of Governor over [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Collins. ''A History of Modern Sudan.'' Cambridge University Press, May 29, 2008 pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually Rahma controlled 30 ''zaribas'', and earned the titles of [[bey]] and [[Pasha]], after allying himself, and his lieutenant [[Rabih az-Zubayr]], with the [[khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail Pasha]] briefly during the invasion of Darfur, where he led the southern forces.  He was referred to as "the Black Pasha", and ultimately wished to become [[Governor General]].&lt;ref name="hake" /&gt;

==Opposition to Gordon==
In 1877, General Gordon arrived as the newly appointed Governor of the Sudan, and sought to suppress the slavetrade. Rahma brought his grievances to Cairo, asking for the Governorship of the newly conquered Darfur, but was rejected.  Egyptian authorities also prohibited his return to Sudan, but allowed him to travel to [[Constantinople]] at the outbreak of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

That year, Gordon wrote back to England "I have to contend with many vested interested, with fanaticism, with the abolition...with a large semi-independent province lately under Sebehr, the Black Pasha, at Bahr Gazelle".&lt;ref name="hake" /&gt;

Rahma's 22-year-old&lt;ref name="storm" /&gt; son Suleiman also fought against General Gordon from a stronghold, nicknamed ''The [[Cave of Adullam]]'', located outside [[Shaka, Sudan|Shaka]].&lt;ref name="hake" /&gt;  Gordon briefly considered offering Suleiman the position of Governor of Dara in an attempt to occupy him with peaceful plans. Instead he chose to have El Nour, one of Suleiman's chiefs, report on activity within the group and in turn be offered the Governorship himself. Through this, he learned that Suleiman was still receiving letters from Rahma, whose correspondence always included the cryptic phrase "Take care of Abdoul Razoul".&lt;ref name="hake" /&gt;

==Detained in Egypt, his son takes command==
Prior to his 1878 departure to [[Cairo]], where he intended to bribe other pashas with approximately [[Pound sterling|£]]100,000 to recognise his sovereignty,&lt;ref name="lang" /&gt; Rahma had gathered his chiefs under a tree between Shaka and [[Al-Ubayyid|Obeid]] where they agreed that if the plan failed, they would go "to arms! to the road!". He was detained by Egyptian forces for his attempts at bribery, and refused permission to return to the Sudan.  He messaged General Gordon, offering £25,000 annually to the Khedive, and to restore order within the Sudan, if only he would be allowed to return. Gordon declined the offer, and Rahma sent a message to his chiefs that they should "obey the orders given under the tree", which resulted in Gordon being met by near-anarchy upon his return to Khartoum.&lt;ref name="hake" /&gt;

Rahma was subsequently sentenced to death for his role in the insurrection.  Despite this however, he was held in high favour by the Khedival court and entertained as a guest in Cairo, with no attention paid to the sentence.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Intent on dealing with Suleiman while his father was still imprisoned, General Gordon arranged several times to meet peacefully with the young man now leading his father's forces. Referring to him as a "cub", Gordon took an almost fatherly approach towards him,&lt;ref name="hake" /&gt; and explained at his camp that he was aware of what revolts the slavers had been provoking, and he was now offering an ultimatum – either Suleiman announce his surrender of the ''Cave of Adullam'' or he would attack with an overwhelming force.  Feeling sick, and begging time to think on the matter, Suleiman returned to the cave where his forces rumoured that Gordon had served the group poisoned coffee.

Shortly afterwards, Suleiman sent Gordon confirmation of the surrender, and began making his way northwards towards other stations.  While in the city of Shaka, he sent a letter referring to himself as Gordon's "son" and asking for a position of government.  Gordon responded that he would rather die, than grant any title to the rebel leader unless he had travelled to Cairo and sworn allegiance to the [[Khedive]].&lt;ref name="hake" /&gt;

Gordon wrote a few days later, ''"Suleiman no longer hopes to conquer...he may try to go up to other stations inland, but I do not expect it will last long; a retreating commander is rarely in a good temper, and he will soon disgust his people."''&lt;ref name="hake" /&gt;

Angered, Suleiman rallied 6,000 of his men in large raids, which were quickly dispelled at Gordon's command by the troops of [[Yussuf Pasha]] and [[Romolo Gessi]].&lt;ref name="apple"&gt;Appleton's Annual Cyclopaedia, 1884. "Egypt" entry.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buel, J.W. "Heroes of the Dark Continent", 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; Gessi, together with [[Taha Mahomet]] had earlier been credited with sacking ''Dem Sebehr'', a reputed stronghold of the slaving clan.&lt;ref&gt;Jephson, Arthur Jeremy Mounteney. "Emin Pasha and the Rebellion at the Equator", 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September, while travelling through Shaka, Gordon was surprised to be extended an invitation to spend two days in Suleiman's house. He accepted, but spent the following days again rejecting Suleiman's pleas for a title of government, but consoled the young chief by giving him a rifle and teaching him its proper use.&lt;ref name="hake" /&gt; Eventually, Suleiman was captured and executed under the command of Romolo Gessi (on Gordon's orders).&lt;ref name="hake" /&gt;

==Later role in the War==
On 18 February 1884, Gordon offered the imprisoned Rahma leadership of the entire Sudan, in addition to his freedom – if he would help the British keep the forces  of  [[Muhammad Ahmad]] at bay.  The following month Gordon  astonished Europe  by recommending that Rahma be named his successor as Governor of The Sudan.

[[Reginald Wingate|Sir Reginald Wingate]], who knew him personally, declared to British society that Rahma was a "far-seeing, thoughtful man of iron will, a born ruler of men"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mahdi]]ism and the Egyptian Sudan, book v.''&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, [[Queen Victoria]], [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Sir Evelyn Baring]], [[William Ewart Gladstone]] and [[Nubar Pasha]] in Cairo, all agreed to allow Rahma the title, but the order was rescinded by the British government, upset with Rahma's slave-raiding practises.&lt;ref name="storm"&gt;Beresford, John D. ''Storm and Peace'', 1977. pp 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, he was put in charge of all the Negro forces, as well as sharing command of Arab forces with [[Hüseyin Hilmi Pasha|Hussein Pasha]].&lt;ref name="apple" /&gt;

In March 1885, he was removed from command and imprisoned at [[Gibraltar]], when British forces suspected that he might have negotiated [[fealty]] to Ahmad, the "[[false prophet]]", based on alleged correspondence between them.&lt;ref name="apple" /&gt;[[File:ZubeirPasha Deathbed1913 JBChristopherson.jpg|thumb|left|Zubayr on his deathbed in 1913]]
[[File:Al-ZiberPashaStreet Khartoum RomanDeckert24042018.jpg|thumb|Ziber Basha Street in Khartoum, 2018]]
In August 1887 he was allowed to return to Cairo, and after the 1899 reconquest of the Sudan was permitted to settle in his native country. He established himself on his estates at Geili, some 30 miles north of Khartoum.

In retirement Zubayr wrote his memoirs, which were translated into English as ''Black Ivory: Or, the Story of El Zubeir Pasha, Slaver and Sultan, as Told By Himself''.

He died peacefully&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Three Empires on the Nile: The Victorian Jihad, 1869-1899|last=Green|first=Dominic|publisher=Free Press|year=2007|isbn=9781451631609|location=New York|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; in January 1913 in his home village Geili.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/1779|title=Owing and Owning: Zubayr Pasha, Slavery, and Empire in Nineteenth-Century Sudan|last=Berman|first=Zachary|publisher=CUNY Academic Works.|year=2017|isbn=|location=New York|pages=328, 364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still today, a street in downtown Khartoum is named after Zubayr, while the town of Uyujuku in South Sudan is still commonly known as Deim Zubeir.

==History==
[[Lion Air]], the parent company of Batik Air, created Batik Air as a full-service airline which began operations in May 2013 using [[Boeing 737-900ER]]s leased from Lion Air.  Batik Air's 737-900ERs were fitted with two-class seating, replacing Lion Air's two-class 737-900ER service. Batik Air provides a [[personal television]] ([[In-flight entertainment|in-flight entertainment system]]) in every seat, light snacks and free meals, [[seat pitch]]es of {{Convert|32|in|cm}} for [[economy class]] and {{Convert|45|in|cm|0}} for [[business class]], and a free baggage allowance of {{Convert|20|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for economy class and {{Convert|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for business class. In mid-2012, Lion Air signed a commitment with [[Boeing]] for five [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787 Dreamliner]]s for Batik Air, intending to have them delivered by 2015. Lion Air later cancelled this deal and temporarily shelved its plans for the long-haul expansion of Batik Air in 2014 due to it's [[List of air carriers banned in the European Union|EU Blackist]] at that time.&lt;ref name="BatikAir_FG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New Airline_JakartaPost"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cengkareng|first=Banten|title=Lion’s full service Batik Air to launch maiden flights|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/04/10/lion-s-full-service-batik-air-launch-maiden-flights.html|accessdate=10 April 2013|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="787 commitment_ATW"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Karen|title=Lion Air signs Dreamliner commitment for premium carrier|url=http://atwonline.com/aircraft-engines-components/news/lion-air-signs-dreamliner-commitment-premium-carrier-0608|accessdate=10 June 2012|newspaper=Air Transport World|date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lion Cancel 787s_Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|last=Govindasami|first=Siva|title=Lion Air to cancel order for five Boeing 787s|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/27/us-lionair-boeing-idUSBREA0Q1CU20140127|accessdate=8 June 2015|newspaper=Reuters|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47367">[[Image:Business Process Reengineering  Cycle.svg|thumb|240px|Business process reengineering cycle]]
'''Business process re-engineering''' ('''BPR''') is a [[Strategic management|business management strategy]], originally pioneered in the early 1990s, focusing on the analysis and design of [[workflow]]s and [[business process]]es within an organization. BPR aimed to help [[organization]]s fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to dramatically improve [[customer service]], cut [[operational costs]], and become world-class [[competitor]]s.&lt;ref name="GAO97"&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/assets/80/76302.pdf Business Process Re-engineering Assessment Guide], United States General Accounting Office, May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

BPR seeks to help companies radically restructure their organizations by focusing on the ground-up design of their business processes. According to early BPR proponent Thomas Davenport (1990), a business process is a set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome. Re-engineering emphasized a [[Holism|holistic]] focus on business objectives and how processes related to them, encouraging full-scale recreation of processes rather than iterative optimization of sub-processes.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

Business process reengineering is also known as business process redesign, [[business transformation]], or business process change management.

== Overview ==
[[Image:Reengineering guidence.jpg|thumb|240px|Reengineering guidance and relationship of mission and work processes to information technology.]]
Business process reengineering (BPR) is the practice of rethinking and redesigning the way work is done to better support an organization's [[Mission statement|mission]] and reduce [[cost]]s. Organizations reengineer two key areas of their businesses. First, they use modern technology to enhance data dissemination and decision-making processes. Then, they alter functional organizations to form functional teams.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Reengineering starts with a high-level assessment of the organization's mission, strategic goals, and [[requirements|customer needs]]. Basic questions are asked, such as "Does our mission need to be redefined? Are our strategic goals aligned with our mission? Who are our customers?" An organization may find that it is operating on questionable assumptions, particularly in terms of the wants and needs of its customers. Only after the organization rethinks what it should be doing, does it go on to decide how best to do it.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

Within the [[Conceptual framework|framework]] of this basic assessment of mission and goals, re-engineering focuses on the organization's business processes—the steps and procedures that govern how resources are used to create [[Product (business)|product]]s and [[Service (economics)|service]]s that meet the needs of particular [[customer]]s or [[Market (economics)|market]]s. As a structured ordering of work steps across time and place, a business process can be decomposed into specific activities, measured, modeled, and improved. It can also be completely redesigned or eliminated altogether. Re-engineering identifies, analyzes, and re-designs an organization's core business processes with the aim of achieving dramatic improvements in critical performance measures, such as cost, quality, service, and speed.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

Re-engineering recognizes that an organization's [[business process]]es are usually fragmented into sub-processes and tasks that are carried out by several specialized functional areas within the organization. Often, no one is responsible for the overall performance of the entire process. Reengineering maintains that optimizing the performance of sub-processes can result in some benefits, but cannot yield dramatic improvements if the process itself is fundamentally inefficient and outmoded. For that reason, re-engineering focuses on re-designing the process as a whole in order to achieve the greatest possible benefits to the organization and their customers. This drive for realizing dramatic improvements by fundamentally re-thinking how the organization's work should be done distinguishes the re-engineering from process improvement efforts that focus on functional or incremental improvement.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

== History ==
Business process reengineering (BPR) began as a private sector technique to help [[organization]]s fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to dramatically improve [[customer service]], cut [[operational costs]], and become world-class [[competitor]]s. A key stimulus for re-engineering has been the continuing development and deployment of sophisticated [[information system]]s and [[Computer network|networks]]. Leading organizations are becoming bolder in using this technology to support innovative business processes, rather than refining current ways of doing work.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

=== Reengineering Work: Don't Automate, Obliterate, 1990 ===
In 1990, [[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]], a former professor of computer science at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), published the article "Reengineering Work: Don't Automate, Obliterate" in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', in which he claimed that the major challenge for managers is to obliterate forms of work that do not add value, rather than using technology for automating it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hammer, [http://hbr.org/1990/07/reengineering-work-dont-automate-obliterate "Reengineering Work: Don’t Automate, Obliterate"], ''Hardvard Business Review'', July, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; This statement implicitly accused managers of having focused on the wrong issues, namely that technology in general, and more specifically information technology, has been used primarily for automating existing processes rather than using it as an enabler for making non-value adding work obsolete.

Hammer's claim was simple: Most of the work being done does not add any value for customers, and this work should be removed, not accelerated through automation. Instead, companies should reconsider their inability to satisfy customer needs, and their insufficient cost structure{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. Even well-established management thinkers, such as [[Peter Drucker]]  and [[Tom Peters]], were accepting and advocating BPR as a new tool for (re-)achieving success in a dynamic world.&lt;ref name="Forbes93"&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1993/08/23/78237/index.htm Forbes: Reengineering, The Hot New Managing Tool], August 23, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; During the following years, a fast-growing number of publications, books as well as journal articles, were dedicated to BPR, and many consulting firms embarked on this trend and developed BPR methods. However, the critics were fast to claim that BPR was a way to dehumanize the work place, increase managerial control, and to justify [[Layoff|downsizing]], i.e. major reductions of the work force,&lt;ref&gt;(Greenbaum 1995, Industry Week 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; and a rebirth of [[Taylorism]] under a different label.

Despite this critique, reengineering was adopted at an accelerating pace and by 1993, as many as 60% of the [[Fortune 500]] companies claimed to either have initiated reengineering efforts, or to have plans to do so.&lt;ref name="AAAI"&gt;[http://aaaipress.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/download/1113/1031 Hamscher, Walter: "AI in Business-Process Reengineering"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311194739/http://aaaipress.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/download/1113/1031|date=11 March 2014}}, AI Magazine Volume 15 Number 4, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was fueled by the fast adoption of BPR by the consulting industry, but also by the study ''Made in America'',&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Dertouzos, Robert M. Solow and Richard K. Lester (1989) ''Made In America: Regaining the Productive Edge''. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by MIT, that showed how companies in many US industries had lagged behind their foreign counterparts in terms of competitiveness, [[time-to-market]] and [[productivity]].

=== Development after 1995 ===
With the publication of critiques in 1995 and 1996 by some{{Who|date=August 2016}} of the early BPR proponents{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, coupled with abuses and misuses of the concept by others, the reengineering fervor in the U.S. began to wane. Since then, considering business processes as a starting point for business analysis and redesign has become a widely accepted approach and is a standard part of the change methodology portfolio, but is typically performed in a less radical way than originally proposed.

More recently, the concept of [[Business Process Management]] (BPM) has gained major attention in the corporate world and can be considered a successor to the BPR wave of the 1990s, as it is evenly driven by a striving for process efficiency supported by information technology. Equivalently to the critique brought forward against BPR, BPM is now accused{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} of focusing on technology and disregarding the people aspects of change.

== Topics ==
The most notable definitions of reengineering are:
* "... the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical contemporary modern measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service, and speed."&lt;ref&gt;Hammer and Champy (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "encompasses the envisioning of new work strategies, the actual process design activity, and the implementation of the change in all its complex technological, human, and organizational dimensions."&lt;ref name="dav93"&gt;[[Thomas H. Davenport]] (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

BPR is different from other approaches to organization development (OD), especially the continuous improvement or TQM movement, by virtue of its aim for fundamental and radical change rather than iterative improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson ''et al.'' (1993):  "Business Process Reengineering, although a close relative, seeks radical rather than merely continuous improvement. It escalates the efforts of JIT and TQM to make process orientation a strategic tool and a core competence of the organization. BPR concentrates on core business processes, and uses the specific techniques within the JIT and TQM ”toolboxes” as enablers, while broadening the process vision."&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve the major improvements BPR is seeking for, the change of structural organizational variables, and other ways of managing and performing work is often considered insufficient. For being able to reap the achievable benefits fully, the use of [[information technology]] (IT) is conceived as a major contributing factor. While IT traditionally has been used for supporting the existing business functions, i.e. it was used for increasing organizational efficiency, it now plays a role as enabler of new organizational forms, and patterns of collaboration within and between organizations{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

BPR derives its existence from different disciplines, and four major areas can be identified as being subjected to change in BPR – organization, technology, strategy, and people – where a process view is used as common framework for considering these dimensions.

Business strategy is the primary driver of BPR initiatives and the other dimensions are governed by strategy's encompassing role. The organization dimension reflects the structural elements of the company, such as hierarchical levels, the composition of organizational units, and the distribution of work between them{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. Technology is concerned with the use of computer systems and other forms of [[communication technology]] in the business. In BPR, information technology is generally considered to act as enabler of new forms of organizing and collaborating, rather than supporting existing business functions. The people / [[human resources]] dimension deals with aspects such as education, training, motivation and reward systems. The concept of business processes – interrelated activities aiming at creating a value added output to a customer – is the basic underlying idea of BPR. These processes are characterized by a number of attributes: Process ownership, customer focus, value adding, and cross-functionality.

===The role of information technology===
Information technology (IT) has historically played an important role in the reengineering concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aca0b8dc-dfc0-11df-bed9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1VySiR5f7 Business efficiency: IT can help paint a bigger picture, Financial Times, featuring Ian Manocha, Lynne Munns and Andy Cross]&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded by some as a major enabler for new forms of working and collaborating within an organization and across organizational borders{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.

BPR literature&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Hammer &amp; Champy (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; identified several so called ''disruptive technologies'' that were supposed to challenge traditional wisdom about how work should be performed.
* Shared databases, making information available at many places  
* Expert systems, allowing generalists to perform specialist tasks
* Telecommunication networks, allowing organizations to be centralized and decentralized at the same time
* Decision-support tools, allowing decision-making to be a part of everybody's job
* [[Wireless data communication]] and [[portable computer]]s, allowing field personnel to work office independent
* Interactive videodisk, to get in immediate contact with potential buyers
* Automatic identification and tracking, allowing things to tell where they are, instead of requiring to be found
* High performance computing, allowing on-the-fly planning and revisioning

In the mid-1990s, especially workflow management systems were considered a significant contributor to improved process efficiency. Also, ERP ([[enterprise resource planning]]) vendors, such as [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[JD Edwards]], Oracle, [[PeopleSoft]], positioned their solutions as vehicles for business process redesign and improvement.

===Research and methodology ===
[[Image:Bpr1.png|thumb|240px|Model based on PRLC approach]]
Although the labels and steps differ slightly, the early methodologies that were rooted in IT-centric BPR solutions share many of the same basic principles and elements. The following outline is one such model, based on the PRLC (Process Reengineering Life Cycle) approach developed by Guha.&lt;ref&gt;Guha et al. (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Simplified schematic outline of using a business process approach, exemplified for pharmaceutical R&amp;D
# Structural organization with functional units
# Introduction of New Product Development as cross-functional process
# Re-structuring and streamlining activities, removal of non-value adding tasks

Benefiting from lessons learned from the early adopters, some BPR practitioners advocated a change in emphasis to a customer-centric, as opposed to an IT-centric, methodology.  One such methodology, that also incorporated a Risk and Impact Assessment to account for the effect that BPR can have on jobs and operations, was described by Lon Roberts (1994).&lt;ref&gt;Lon Roberts (1994) ''Process reengineering: the key to achieving breakthrough success''.&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts also stressed the use of change management tools to proactively address resistance to change—a factor linked to the demise of many reengineering initiatives that looked good on the drawing board.

Some items to use on a process analysis checklist are: Reduce handoffs, Centralize data, Reduce delays, Free resources faster, Combine similar activities. Also within the management consulting industry, a significant number of methodological approaches have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;A set of short papers, outlining and comparing some of them can be found here, followed by some guidelines for companies considering to contract a consultancy for a BPR initiative:

=== Framework ===
An easy to follow seven step INSPIRE framework is developed by Bhudeb Chakravarti which can be followed by any Process Analyst to perform BPR. The seven steps of the framework are '''Initiate''' a new process reengineering project and prepare a business case for the same; '''Negotiate''' with senior management to get approval to start the process reengineering project; '''Select''' the key processes that need to be reengineered; '''Plan''' the process reengineering activities; '''Investigate''' the processes to analyze the problem areas; '''Redesign''' the selected processes to improve the performance and '''Ensure''' the successful implementation of redesigned processes through proper monitoring and evaluation.

== Factors for success and failure ==
{{tone|date=February 2014}}
Factors that are important to BPR success include:

# BPR team composition.
# Business needs analysis.
# Adequate IT infrastructure.
# Effective [[change management]]. 
# Ongoing continuous improvement

The aspects of a BPM effort that are modified include organizational structures, management systems, employee responsibilities and performance measurements, incentive systems, skills development, and the use of IT. BPR can potentially affect every aspect of how business is conducted today.  Wholesale changes can cause results ranging from enviable success to complete failure.

If successful, a BPM initiative can result in improved quality, customer service, and competitiveness, as well as reductions in cost or cycle time. However, 50-70% of reengineering projects are either failures or do not achieve significant benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Productivity Organization: Business Process re-engineering. http://www.apo-tokyo.org/productivity/pmtt_016.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many reasons for sub-optimal business processes which include:

# One department may be optimized at the expense of another
# Lack of time to focus on improving business process
# Lack of recognition of the extent of the problem
# Lack of training
# People involved use the best tool they have at their disposal which is usually [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] to fix problems
# Inadequate infrastructure
# Overly bureaucratic processes
# Lack of motivation

Many unsuccessful BPR attempts may have been due to the confusion surrounding BPR, and how it should be performed.  Organizations were well aware that changes needed to be made, but did not know which areas to change or how to change them.  As a result, process reengineering is a management concept that has been formed by trial and error or, in other words, practical experience. As more and more businesses reengineer their processes, knowledge of what caused the successes or failures is becoming apparent.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"&gt;(Covert, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  To reap lasting benefits, companies must be willing to examine how strategy and reengineering complement each other by learning to quantify strategy in terms of cost, milestones, and timetables, by accepting ownership of the strategy throughout the organization, by assessing the organization’s current capabilities and process realistically, and by linking strategy to the budgeting process.  Otherwise, BPR is only a short-term efficiency exercise.&lt;ref&gt;(Berman, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organization-wide commitment ===
Major changes to business processes have a direct effect on processes, technology, job roles, and workplace culture.  Significant changes to even one of those areas require resources, money, and leadership.  Changing them simultaneously is an extraordinary task.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"/&gt; Like any large and complex undertaking, implementing reengineering requires the talents and energies of a broad spectrum of experts.  Since BPR can involve multiple areas within the organization, it is important to get support from all affected departments. Through the involvement of selected department members, the organization can gain valuable input before a process is implemented; a step which promotes both the cooperation and the vital acceptance of the reengineered process by all segments of the organization.

Getting enterprise wide commitment involves the following: top management sponsorship, bottom-up buy-in from process users, dedicated BPR team, and budget allocation for the total solution with measures to demonstrate value. Before any BPR project can be implemented successfully, there must be a commitment to the project by the management of the organization, and strong leadership must be provided.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Kleiner, 1997"&gt;(Campbell &amp; Kleiner, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Reengineering efforts can by no means be exercised without a company-wide commitment to the goals.  However, top management commitment is imperative for success.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"&gt;(Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Jackson, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  Top management must recognize the need for change, develop a complete understanding of what BPR is, and plan how to achieve it.&lt;ref name="Motwani, et al., 1998"&gt;(Motwani, et al., 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leadership has to be effective, strong, visible, and creative in thinking and understanding in order to provide a clear [[company vision|vision]].&lt;ref name="Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999"&gt;(Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  Convincing every affected group within the organization of the need for BPR is a key step in successfully implementing a process.  By informing all affected groups at every stage, and emphasizing the positive end results of the reengineering process, it is possible to minimize resistance to change and increase the odds for success. The ultimate success of BPR depends on the strong, consistent, and continuous involvement of all departmental levels within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;(King, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Team composition ===
Once organization-wide commitment has been secured from all departments involved in the reengineering effort and at different levels, the critical step of selecting a BPR team must be taken. This team will form the nucleus of the BPR effort, make key decisions and recommendations, and help communicate the details and benefits of the BPR program to the entire organization. The determinants of an effective BPR team may be summarized as follows: 
* competency of the members of the team, their motivation,&lt;ref&gt;(Rastogi, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* their credibility within the organization and their creativity,&lt;ref&gt;(Barrett, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* team empowerment, training of members in process mapping and brainstorming techniques,&lt;ref name="Carr, 1993"&gt;(Carr, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* effective team leadership,&lt;ref&gt;(Berrington &amp; Oblich, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* proper organization of the team,&lt;ref&gt;(Guha, et al., 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* complementary skills among team members, adequate size, interchangeable accountability, clarity of work approach, and 
* specificity of goals.&lt;ref&gt;(Katzenbach &amp; Smith, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most effective BPR teams include active representatives from the following work groups: top management, business area responsible for the process being addressed, technology groups, finance, and members of all ultimate process users’ groups. Team members who are selected from each work group within the organization will affect the outcome of the reengineered process according to their desired requirements.  The BPR team should be mixed in depth and knowledge.  For example, it may include members with the following characteristics:

* Members who do not know the process at all.
* Members who know the process inside-out.
* Customers, if possible.
* Members representing affected departments.
* One or two members of the best, brightest, passionate, and committed technology experts.
* Members from outside of the organization&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;

Moreover, Covert (1997) recommends that in order to have an effective BPR team, it must be kept under ten players.  If the organization fails to keep the team at a manageable size, the entire process will be much more difficult to execute efficiently and effectively.  The efforts of the team must be focused on identifying breakthrough opportunities and designing new work steps or processes that will create quantum gains and competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="Motwani, et al., 1998"/&gt;

=== Business needs analysis ===
Another important factor in the success of any BPR effort is performing a thorough business needs analysis.  Too often, BPR teams jump directly into the technology without first assessing the current processes of the organization and determining what exactly needs reengineering. In this analysis phase, a series of sessions should be held with process owners and stakeholders, regarding the need and strategy for BPR.  These sessions build a consensus as to the vision of the ideal business process. They help identify essential goals for BPR within each department and then collectively define objectives for how the project will affect each work group or department on individual basis and the business organization as a whole. The idea of these sessions is to conceptualize the ideal business process for the organization and build a business process model.  Those items that seem unnecessary or unrealistic may be eliminated or modified later on in the diagnosing stage of the BPR project. It is important to acknowledge and evaluate all ideas in order to make all participants feel that they are a part of this important and crucial process.  Results of these meetings will help formulate the basic plan for the project.

This plan includes the following: 
* identifying specific problem areas, 
* solidifying particular goals, and 
* defining business objectives.  
The business needs analysis contributes tremendously to the re-engineering effort by helping the BPR team to prioritize and determine where it should focus its improvements efforts.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;

The business needs analysis also helps in relating the BPR project goals back to key business objectives and the overall strategic direction for the organization.  This linkage should show the thread from the top to the bottom of the organization, so each person can easily connect the overall business direction with the re-engineering effort. This alignment must be demonstrated from the perspective of financial performance, customer service, associate value, and the vision for the organization.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"/&gt;  Developing a business vision and process objectives relies, on the one hand, on a clear understanding of organizational strengths, weaknesses, and market structure, and on the other, on awareness and knowledge about innovative activities undertaken by competitors and other organizations.&lt;ref name="Vakola &amp; Rezgui, 2000"&gt;(Vakola &amp; Rezgui, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
BPR projects that are not in alignment with the organization’s strategic direction can be counterproductive.  There is always a possibility that an organization may make significant investments in an area that is not a core competency for the company and later outsource this capability.  Such reengineering initiatives are wasteful and steal resources from other strategic projects. Moreover, without strategic alignment, the organization’s key stakeholders and sponsors may find themselves unable to provide the level of support the organization needs in terms of resources, especially if there are other more critical projects to the future of the business, and are more aligned with the strategic direction.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"/&gt;

=== Adequate IT infrastructure ===
Researchers consider adequate [[IT infrastructure]] reassessment and composition as a vital factor in successful BPR implementation.&lt;ref name="Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999"/&gt;  Hammer (1990) prescribes the use of IT to challenge the assumptions inherent in the work process that have existed since long before the advent of modern computer and communications technology.&lt;ref&gt;(Malhotra, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Factors related to IT infrastructure have been increasingly considered by many researchers and practitioners as a vital component of successful BPR efforts.&lt;ref name="Ross, 1998"&gt;(Ross, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Effective alignment of IT infrastructure and BPR strategy, 
* building an effective IT infrastructure,
* adequate IT infrastructure investment decision, 
* adequate measurement of IT infrastructure effectiveness,
* proper information systems (IS) integration, 
* effective reengineering of legacy IS, 
* increasing IT function competency, and 
* effective use of software tools are the most important factors that contribute to the success of BPR projects.

These are vital factors that contribute to building an effective IT infrastructure for business processes.&lt;ref name="Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999"/&gt;  BPR must be accompanied by strategic planning which addresses leveraging IT as a competitive tool.&lt;ref name="Weicher, et al., 1995"&gt;(Weicher, et al., 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; An IT infrastructure is made up of physical assets, intellectual assets, shared services,&lt;ref&gt;(Broadbent &amp; Weill, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and their linkages.&lt;ref name="Kayworth, et al., 1997"&gt;(Kayworth, et al., 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The way in which the IT infrastructure components are composed and their linkages determines the extent to which information resources can be delivered.  An effective IT infrastructure composition process follows a top-down approach, beginning with business strategy and IS strategy and passing through designs of data, systems, and computer architecture.&lt;ref&gt;(Malhotra, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Linkages between the IT infrastructure components, as well as descriptions of their contexts of interaction, are important for ensuring integrity and consistency among the IT infrastructure components.&lt;ref name="Ross, 1998"/&gt;  Furthermore, IT standards have a major role in reconciling various infrastructure components to provide shared IT services that are of a certain degree of effectiveness to support business process applications, as well as to guide the process of acquiring, managing, and utilizing IT assets.&lt;ref name="Kayworth, et al., 1997"/&gt; The IT infrastructure shared services and the human IT infrastructure components, in terms of their responsibilities and their needed expertise, are both vital to the process of the IT infrastructure composition.  IT strategic alignment is approached through the process of integration between business and IT strategies, as well as between IT and organizational infrastructures.&lt;ref name="Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999"/&gt;

Most analysts view BPR and IT as irrevocably linked.  Walmart, for example, would not have been able to reengineer the processes used to procure and distribute mass-market retail goods without IT.  Ford was able to decrease its headcount in the procurement department by 75 percent by using IT in conjunction with BPR, in another well-known example.&lt;ref name="Weicher, et al., 1995"/&gt; The IT infrastructure and BPR are interdependent in the sense that deciding the information requirements for the new business processes determines the IT infrastructure constituents, and a recognition of IT capabilities provides alternatives for BPR.&lt;ref name="Ross, 1998"/&gt; Building a responsive IT infrastructure is highly dependent on an appropriate determination of business process information needs.  This, in turn, is determined by the types of activities embedded in a business process, and their sequencing and reliance on other organizational processes.&lt;ref&gt;(Sabherwal &amp; King, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effective change management ===
Al-Mashari and Zairi (2000) suggest that BPR involves changes in people behavior and culture, processes, and technology.  As a result, there are many factors that prevent the effective implementation of BPR and hence restrict innovation and continuous improvement. [[Change management]], which involves all human and social related changes and cultural adjustment techniques needed by management to facilitate the insertion of newly designed processes and structures into working practice and to deal effectively with resistance, is considered by many researchers to be a crucial component of any BPR effort.One of the most overlooked obstacles to successful BPR project implementation is resistance from those whom implementers believe will benefit the most.  Most projects underestimate the cultural effect of major process and structural change and as a result, do not achieve the full potential of their change effort.  Many people fail to understand that change is not an event, but rather a management technique.

Change management is the discipline of managing change as a process, with due consideration that employees are people, not programmable machines.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"/&gt;  Change is implicitly driven by motivation which is fueled by the recognition of the need for change.  An important step towards any successful reengineering effort is to convey an understanding of the necessity for change.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;  It is a well-known fact that organizations do not change unless people change; the better change is managed, the less painful the transition is.

[[Organizational culture]] is a determining factor in successful BPR implementation.&lt;ref&gt;(Zairi &amp; Sinclair, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizational culture influences the organization’s ability to adapt to change.  Culture in an organization is a self-reinforcing set of beliefs, attitudes, and behavior.  Culture is one of the most resistant elements of organizational behavior and is extremely difficult to change. BPR must consider current culture in order to change these beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors effectively.  Messages conveyed from management in an organization continually enforce current culture.  Change is implicitly driven by motivation which is fueled by the recognition of the need for change.

The first step towards any successful transformation effort is to convey an understanding of the necessity for change.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;  Management rewards system, stories of company origin and early successes of founders, physical symbols, and company icons constantly enforce the message of the current culture. Implementing BPR successfully is dependent on how thoroughly management conveys the new cultural messages to the organization.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Kleiner, 1997"/&gt;  These messages provide people in the organization with a guideline to predict the outcome of acceptable behavior patterns.  People should be the focus for any successful business change.
  
BPR is not a recipe for successful business transformation if it focuses on only computer technology and process redesign.  In fact, many BPR projects have failed because they did not recognize the importance of the human element in implementing BPR.  Understanding the people in organizations, the current company culture, motivation, leadership, and past performance is essential to recognize, understand, and integrate into the vision and implementation of BPR.  If the human element is given equal or greater emphasis in BPR, the odds of successful business transformation increase substantially.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Kleiner, 1997"/&gt;

=== Ongoing continuous improvement ===
Many organizational change theorists hold a common view of organizations adjusting gradually and incrementally and responding locally to individual crises as they arise&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt; Common elements are:  
* BPR is a successive and ongoing process and should be regarded as an improvement strategy that enables an organization to make the move from traditional functional orientation to one that aligns with strategic business processes.&lt;ref name="Vakola &amp; Rezgui, 2000"/&gt;  
* Continuous improvement is defined as the propensity of the organization to pursue incremental and innovative improvements in its processes, products, and services.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;  The incremental change is governed by the knowledge gained from each previous change cycle.  
* It is essential that the automation infrastructure of the BPR activity provides for performance measurements in order to support continuous improvements.  It will need to efficiently capture appropriate data and allow access to appropriate individuals.  
* To ensure that the process generates the desired benefits, it must be tested before it is deployed to the end users.  If it does not perform satisfactorily, more time should be taken to modify the process until it does.  
* A fundamental concept for quality practitioners is the use of feedback loops at every step of the process and an environment that encourages constant evaluation of results and individual efforts to improve.&lt;ref name="Gore, 1999"&gt;(Gore, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  
* At the end user’s level, there must be a proactive feedback mechanism that provides for and facilitates resolutions of problems and issues.  This will also contribute to a continuous risk assessment and evaluation which are needed throughout the implementation process to deal with any risks at their initial state and to ensure the success of the reengineering efforts.  
* Anticipating and planning for risk handling is important for dealing effectively with any risk when it first occurs and as early as possible in the BPR process.&lt;ref&gt;(Clemons, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is interesting that many of the successful applications of reengineering described by its proponents are in organizations practicing continuous improvement programs.  
* Hammer and Champy (1993) use the IBM Credit Corporation as well as Ford and Kodak, as examples of companies that carried out BPR successfully due to the fact that they had long-running continuous improvement programs.&lt;ref name="Gore, 1999"/&gt;

In conclusion, successful BPR can potentially create substantial improvements in the way organizations do business and can actually produce fundamental improvements for business operations.  However, in order to achieve that, there are some key success factors that must be taken into consideration when performing BPR.

BPR success factors are a collection of lessons learned from reengineering projects and from these lessons common themes have emerged.  In addition, the ultimate success of BPR depends on the people who do it and on how well they can be committed and motivated to be creative and to apply their detailed knowledge to the reengineering initiative. Organizations planning to undertake BPR must take into consideration the success factors of BPR in order to ensure that their reengineering related change efforts are comprehensive, well-implemented, and have minimum chance of failure. This has been very beneficial in all terms

== Critique ==
Many companies used reengineering as a pretext to [[layoff|downsizing]], though this was not the intent of reengineering's proponents; consequently, reengineering earned a reputation for being synonymous with downsizing and layoffs.&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;[http://www.livemint.com/2008/09/06000936/Michael-Hammer-who-made-reeng.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many circumstances, reengineering has not always lived up to its expectations. Some prominent reasons include:
* Reengineering assumes that the factor that limits an organization's performance is the ineffectiveness of its processes (which may or may not be true) and offers no means of validating that assumption.
* Reengineering assumes the need to start the process of performance improvement with a "clean slate," i.e. totally disregard the ''[[status quo]].''
* According to [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] (and his [[Theory of Constraints]]) reengineering does not provide an effective way to focus improvement efforts on the organization's constraint{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

Others have claimed that reengineering was a recycled [[buzzword]] for commonly-held ideas. Abrahamson (1996) argued that fashionable management terms tend to follow a lifecycle, which for Reengineering peaked between 1993 and 1996 (Ponzi and Koenig 2002). They argue that Reengineering was in fact nothing new (as e.g. when Henry Ford implemented the [[assembly line]] in 1908, he was in fact reengineering, radically changing the way of thinking in an organization).

The most frequent critique against BPR concerns the strict focus on efficiency and technology and the disregard of people in the organization that is subjected to a reengineering initiative. Very often, the label BPR was used for major workforce reductions. Thomas Davenport, an early BPR proponent, stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When I wrote about "business process redesign" in 1990, I explicitly said that using it for cost reduction alone was not a sensible goal. And consultants Michael Hammer and James Champy, the two names most closely associated with reengineering, have insisted all along that layoffs shouldn't be the point. But the fact is, once out of the bottle, the reengineering genie quickly turned ugly."&lt;ref&gt;(Davenport, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hammer similarly admitted that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I wasn't smart enough about that. I was reflecting my engineering background and was insufficient appreciative of the human dimension. I've learned that's critical."&lt;ref&gt;(White, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early life and career==
Lee was born in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]. She is a third generation [[Malaysian Chinese]]. Describing her own personality, she stated that she rarely cried as a child.&lt;ref name="Sina20041108"&gt;{{citation|url=http://eladies.sina.com.cn/2004-11-08/121393.html|periodical=Sina News|date=8 November 2004|title=冠军女孩李诗琪的美丽心情|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did her education at [[SMK Segambut Jaya]] ([[:ms:Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Segambut Jaya|see Malaysian Wikipedia]]) in [[Segambut]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], and represented the [[Federal Territory (Malaysia)|Federal Territory]] in [[Team handball|handball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2005/1/31/features/10002495&amp;sec=features |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019145451/http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=%2F2005%2F1%2F31%2Ffeatures%2F10002495&amp;sec=features |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 October 2012 |periodical=The Star |date=31 January 2005 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |title=Carrie Lee is out of this world |last=Tham |first=Ai-Mei |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During her school days, she was known as a tomboy, an image which she later chose to shed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2004/10/17/nation/9156861&amp;sec=nation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404202156/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2004%2F10%2F17%2Fnation%2F9156861&amp;sec=nation |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 April 2005 |periodical=The Star |date=17 October 2004 |accessdate=27 September 2011 |title=Former 'Tomboy' to represent Malaysia at pageant in Hong Kong |last=Ng |first=Cheng-Yee |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She represented Malaysia in [[Miss Tourism International]] 2003 and placed Top 15. In 2004, Lee represented Malaysia in the Miss Chinese Cosmos beauty pageant. During the proceedings, she spoke Chinese rather stammeringly, which observers suggested could be a barrier to her carrying out her duties as title-holder; nevertheless, she went on to win the top prize.&lt;ref name="Sina20041108"/&gt; In media interviews following her victory, she stated that she hoped to become an actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://ent.enorth.com.cn/system/2004/12/04/000917682.shtml|date=4 December 2004|accessdate=27 September 2011|title=中华小姐冠军亮相 李诗琪我适合演戏|periodical=Tianjin North News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she entered [[Jinan University]]'s Chinese Department as a short-term student to study [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. Her oral skills showed significant improvement compared to the Miss Chinese Cosmos proceedings, but she was still not able to read or [[written Chinese|write Chinese]] aside from her own name. She hoped that studying at Jinan University would help her to become literate in Chinese and appreciate [[Chinese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://edu.sina.com.cn/y/i/2005-09-01/102542731.html|date=1 September 2005|periodical=Sina News|title=中华小姐李诗琪求学暨大 第一天上课学写拍马屁|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to Malaysia in 2005.&lt;ref name="AsiaOne20110712"&gt;{{citation |url=http://business.asiaone.com/Business/My%2BMoney/Property/Story/A1Story20110712-288766.html |date=12 July 2011 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |title=Carried away by Miss Lee |last=Wilson |first=Willy |periodical=The Star |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902052019/http://business.asiaone.com/Business/My%2BMoney/Property/Story/A1Story20110712-288766.html |archivedate=2 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, she had appeared in two Chinese-language television series in Malaysia, and worked as a promotional model for [[Pepsi]], [[Matsushita]], and [[Sony]].&lt;ref name="Phoenix"&gt;{{citation|url=http://phtv.ifeng.com/program/lyyy/xxz/200709/0910_1619_242294_1.shtml|date=10 September 2007|accessdate=26 September 2011|title=最无悬念的选美理由：李诗琪，目标星光大道|periodical=[[Phoenix Television]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later went into business, purchasing the Miss Chinese Cosmos franchise for Malaysia, and founding White Fairy Sdn.

'''Crystal Decisions''' (previously known as ''[[Seagate Software]] Information Management Group'') was a company that was known for its [[business intelligence]] products.

The company was formed when [[hard disk drive]] manufacturer [[Seagate Technology]] acquired [[Holos#Company|Holistic Systems]] and [[Crystal Services]] with the intention of pursuing better profit margins in the [[software]] market. Holistic Systems had a wide range of sales offices, infrastructure and the [[Holos]] [[OLAP]] product, whilst Crystal Services had good [[OEM]] deals for the [[Crystal Reports]] database reporting product that they had written. The first new product from the combined company was Seagate Info, which later evolved to become known as [[Crystal Enterprise]]. [[Crystal Analysis]] followed as an OLAP client.

The company's structure reflected its heritage, with OLAP technologies being developed out of the former Holistic Systems R&amp;D site in [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]] and Relational Database technologies being developed out of the former Crystal Services R&amp;D centre in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].

Crystal Decisions was acquired by [[Business Objects (company)|Business Objects]] in December 2003. As part of this acquisition, the former research and development site in [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]], was closed with a loss of about 80 jobs in order to centralize development in [[Vancouver]] and [[Paris]], with the support for the [[Holos]] product being outsourced to [[Raspberry Software]] based near Ipswich.

The Holos product line has now{{When|date=October 2016}} ceased.

Business Objects was purchased by [[SAP AG|SAP]] in March 2008.

A partnership between [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland City Council]] and Goodman Property (formerly Akeler Developments Ltd.) has seen the creation of {{convert|1350000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of high-specification offices, with the private sector partner investing around £200 million. The first buildings were completed in 1992, providing accommodation for a range of businesses that have played a key role in the regeneration of the City.

At the entrance to the development stands the award-winning sculpture ''Quintisection'' by the sculptor Robert Erskine FRBS. Standing {{convert|26|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|in height}} and {{convert|14.5|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|wide}}, it is made in wrought stainless steel, and is based upon a huge cross-section of an ocean liner. Commissioned by Doxford International Business Park, ''Quintisection'' was awarded by the Royal British Society of  Sculptors the Sir Otto Beit Award for the most outstanding public sculpture, worldwide, for the year 1993/94.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} ''Quintesection'' is the first landmark sculpture to mark the shipbuilding industry of the North East, a region whose communities are famous for 700 years of shipbuilding.

The availability of telecommunications and a skilled workforce has been instrumental in the success of Doxford International, which is now one of the UK's main locations for corporate HQs and contact centres serving the financial and customer service sectors. Around 8,000 people are now employed by a range of blue chip companies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

One business that located on Doxford International is mobile phone operator [[EE Limited]], which has a customer support centre that now employs around 1,000 people. The site operates as a switching centre, underpinning the company's network between Leeds and Edinburgh.

Also on Doxford International, EDS has established a secure data centre. Citifinancial - part of the USA-based [[CitiGroup]] - was one of the businesses that has reinvested in Doxford International, with an expansion project that brought additional jobs to Sunderland. [[CitiGroup]] no longer have a presence at Doxford, leaving the site in 2009.

Doxford International has been at the forefront of developments in business property. For example, the award-winning{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} {{convert|38750|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Solar House makes extensive use of photo-voltaic technology to [[Energy conservation|minimise energy consumption]]. The {{convert|25,500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Regus Centre offers offices and meeting rooms, including [[Broadband Internet access|broadband access]]. The most recent development at Doxford International is Signature House, which was developed in 2007 to provide a new HQ for Wilcomm Homes, and incorporates speculative office suites for small businesses.

[[EDF Energy]] has based its main contact centre at Doxford, originally trading at the site as London Electricity. 

Doxford International has been developed to provide an attractive working environment for employees. As well as small retail outlets such as [[Greggs the bakers]] and a [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] outlet, the Sunderland Health &amp; Racquet Club operated by David Lloyd Leisure provides leisure facilities. Whilst highways access is an asset for the site, there is also [[public transport]], with buses reaching the heart of the business park.

The '''''Finance Business Daily''''' ({{lang-sl|Poslovni dnevnik Finance}}; ''Finance'' meaning ''Finances'') is the only daily [[Slovenia]]n business and financial newspaper. The idea to publish it had already been proposed by [[Iztok Jurančič]] before 1991, when Slovenia declared its independence. However, it was realized only in 1992. At first, the newspaper was published by the company Gospodarski Vestnik. Today, it is published by the Časnik Finance company, which is owned by the Swedish [[Bonnier Group]] and also publishes several other publications; for example, the magazines ''[[Manager (magazine)|Manager]]'' and ''Moje finance'', the healthcare newspaper ''Medicina danes'', and the web portals ''Finance'' and ''Mojevro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cek.ef.uni-lj.si/u_diplome/antoncic4299.pdf |title=Uvajanje CRM-sistema v založniškem podjetju |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Introduction of the CRM System in a Publishing Company |first=Goran |last=Antončič |date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, the Finance Business Daily accounted for three quarter of the Časnik Finance company income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cek.ef.uni-lj.si/u_diplome/milic4048.pdf |title=Ocenjevanje vrednosti blagovne znamke Finance |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Assessment of the Value of the Finance Trademark |first=Marja |last=Milić |date=October 2009 |publisher=Faculty of Economics, University of Ljubljana}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before becoming a daily newspaper in 2002, ''Finance'' was issued twice weekly.

==History==
The first issue of ''Finance'' was published on 20 May 1992.&lt;ref name=johnc/&gt; It is based in [[Ljubljana]].&lt;ref name=johnc&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martine Robinson Beachboard|author2=John C. Beachboard|title=Implications of Foreign Ownership on Journalistic Quality in a Post-Communist Society: The Case of Finance|journal=Informing Science Journal|date=2006|volume=9|url=http://www.inform.nu/Articles/Vol9/v9p143-162Beachboard83.pdf|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was initially a biweekly.&lt;ref name=johnc/&gt;&lt;ref name=lst&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovenia Newspapers Magazines Journals and Weeklies |url=http://www.ljubljanasloveniatravel.com/slovenia-newspapers-magazines-journals-and-weeklies.html |publisher=Ljubljana Slovenia Travel |accessdate=6 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216203832/http://ljubljanasloveniatravel.com/slovenia-newspapers-magazines-journals-and-weeklies.html |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, it had over 2,000 subscribers. In 1994, Gospodarski Vestnik appointed Peter Frankl as its director. In 1999, the company Časnik Finance was established. It was owned by Gospodarski Vestnik (50%), [[Dagens Industrie]] (45%), and several individuals (5%). The director of the company was Jurij Giacomelli. The internet version of the newspaper began in October 2000.

In 2002, ''Finance'' became a daily,&lt;ref name=lst/&gt; and the visual design changed as well. In 2005, the owner of the company Časnik Finance (99.59%) became Bonnier Business Press AB, previously called Dagens Industrie. In 2006 the owner appointed Peter Frankl as the director of Časnik Finance. He also remained the editor-at-large.

In 2003, ''Finance'' had a circulation of 10,000 copies.&lt;ref name=johnc/&gt; The 2007 circulation of the paper was 15,200 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media |url=http://www.ipaslovenija.org/eng/about/09_media.pdf |work=IPA Section Slovenia |accessdate=15 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128160754/http://www.ipaslovenija.org/eng/about/09_media.pdf |archivedate=28 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Code of ethics==
The ''Finance'' journalists have passed an [[ethical code]], named the ''Code of the Journalists of the Finance Newspaper''. It mainly bases on the [[Code of Ethics of Slovene Journalists]], with the addition of several articles related to [[financial journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cek.ef.uni-lj.si/u_diplome/radovic3118.pdf |title=Prikrito oglaševanje v slovenskem medijskem prostoru |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Covert Advertising in the Slovenian Media Space |first=Jerneja |last=Radovič |date=November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''government contractor''' is a company ([[Private company|privately owned]] or [[Public company|publicly traded]] but not a [[state-owned enterprise]]){{spaced ndash}}either [[for profit]] or [[non-profit]]{{spaced ndash}}that produces goods or services under contract for the [[government]].  Some communities are largely sustained by government contracting activity; for instance, much of the economy of [[Northern Virginia]] consists of government contractors employed directly or indirectly by the [[federal government]] of the [[United States]].

==United Kingdom==
Section 12(2) and (3) of the Official Secrets Act 1989 define the expression 
"Government Contractor" for the purposes of that Act.

==Global Student Leadership Award==
The Student Leadership Award was inaugurated in 1991 by the board of directors of the Graduate Business Forum (GBF) to recognize leadership, innovation and a commitment to the greater community at the graduate business level. In the past influential leaders, such as CEOs, prime ministers, presidents and royalty have bestowed this award upon a student or team during a commemorative banquet at the annual Graduate Business Conference.

Dave Chonowski and Chris Petersen, 2009 awardees from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, turned their winning idea into the MBA Veterans Network, a global community of military veteran students and alumni of the world's leading business schools. Their organization has generated significant interest from the business media and has since been featured in both BusinessWeek and the Wall Street Journal. 
 
Member schools may execute up to two nominations for their institution.

'''PT Indosat Tbk''', ([[trade name|doing business as]] '''Indosat Ooredoo''' since 2015 due to [[Ooredoo]]'s majority stake), is a telecommunications provider in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Indosat Indonesia Investments|url = http://www.indonesia-investments.com/business/indonesian-companies/indosat/item200|website = www.indonesia-investments.com|access-date = 2016-02-02|first = Indonesia|last = Investments}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company offers wireless services for mobile phones, and to a lesser extent, [[broadband internet]] lines for homes. Indosat operates their wireless services under a few sub-brands, among them are IM3, Mentari, and Matrix. These brands differ by their payment model (pre-paid vs. post-paid) as well as pricing. Indosat also provides other services such as [[International direct dialing|IDD]], fixed telecommunications, and multimedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Conexus|url = http://www.conexusmobile.com/alliance-sub-indonesia.html|website = www.conexusmobile.com|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Qtel, a majority stakeholder in Indosat, rebranded itself as Ooredoo. This was followed by a renaming of all their subsidiaries across multiple countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Qtel rebrands as Ooredoo -  - ITP.net|url = http://www.itp.net/592393-qtel-rebrands-as-ooredoo#.UYVVvYJQ0Vk|website = ITP.net|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Indosat was renamed Indosat Ooredoo on November 19, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Indosat Ganti Nama jadi Indosat Ooredoo|url = http://www.cnnindonesia.com/teknologi/20151119102759-213-92642/indosat-ganti-nama-jadi-indosat-ooredoo/|website = CNN Indonesia|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st '''International Diamond Cut Conference''', held in [[Moscow]] Russia, April 23–26, 2004, brought industry leaders together to discuss [[diamond cut]], the factor where human intervention has the most influence, yet the least understood and hardest to evaluate.

The conference was hosted by Dr. Yuri Shelementiev, Sergey Sivovolenko, [[Garry Holloway]] and Janak Mistry.

Diamond cutters, grading laboratories, retailers and technology developers gathered to observe and participate in presentations and poster sessions.  Topics covered included standardization of different cut grading systems; the grading of symmetry and proportion effects on cut quality; modern technologies and their application for [[gemology]], manufacturers and the trade; and new software for generation of new and more effective cuts.

Speakers included diamond cutters Maarten DeWitte, [[Brian Gavin]] and [[Gabi Tolkowsky]]; [[American Gem Society]] representatives James Caudill and Peter Yantzer; technology developers [[Garry Holloway]], Udi Lederer, Janak Mistry, Yuri Shelmentiev and [[Sergey Sivovolenko]], Octonus; and researchers V.K. Baranov, A.M. Bocharov, Michael Cowing, A.G. Golubinsky, [[Bruce Harding]], R.I. Ilkaev, Y.N. Rebrik, Dr. Jose Sasian, M.A. Shkadov and [[Iiro Suokko]].

The Second International Diamond Cut Conference, planned to take place in [[Lausanne]] Switzerland in March 2009, will now be rescheduled for a future date: The budgetary and travel restrictions imposed by the worldwide economic crisis caused this postposement.

The '''Lehman family''' is a prominent family of Jewish German-American businesspeople who founded the financial firm [[Lehman Brothers]]. Some were also involved in American politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Shapiro  |first=Gary  |authorlink=   |title= Lehmans To Celebrate Rich Family History  |publisher=[[New York Sun]]|date=February 6, 2007 |url=https://www.nysun.com/new-york/lehmans-to-celebrate-rich-family-history/48101/  |accessdate=|quote=The Lehman family tree includes a governor, a chief justice of the New York State court of appeals, a secretary of the treasury, two ambassadors, members of the U.S. House of Representatives, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons, and a New York State parks commissioner. So, when descendants of one of America's most prominent German Jewish dynasties gather later this month, it will be no ordinary reunion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family traces back to Abraham Lehmann, a cattle merchant in [[Rimpar]], [[Bavaria]], who changed his [[Yiddish]] surname [[Löw|Löw (Loeb)]] to the German [[Lehmann]].

'''Leonid Borisovich Nevzlin''' ({{lang-ru|Леонид Борисович Невзлин}}; {{lang-he|לאוניד בוריסוביץ' נבזלין}}, born 21 September 1959) is a [[Russia]]n-born [[Israel]]i businessman and philanthropist.

Nevzlin occupied various high-ranking positions at [[Group Menatep]] and its subsidiary, the [[Yukos Oil Company]]. In 2003, the Russia expropriated Yukos and began a campaign of persecution against its executives. In 2014, the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] ruled in favor of Nevzlin and other Yukos shareholders, calling the actions of the Russian state “a ruthless campaign to destroy Yukos” and expropriate its assets.

==Professional career==
From 1981-87, Nevzlin was a software engineer at Zarubezhgeologia, an external trade organization of the Soviet Ministry of Geology. In 1987, he met [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]] and became a Deputy Director at the Center for Scientific and Technical Creativity for Youth (MENATEP), attached to the Komsomol committee in Moscow's [[Frunzensky District, Moscow|Frunzensky District]].&lt;ref name=lenta&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lenta.ru/lib/14159507 |title=Невзлин, Леонид |website=Lenta.ru |accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MENATEP established one of the first private banks in Russia, Bank Menatep. From 1989 to 1991, Nevzlin served as president of the bank, after which he held other high-ranking positions, including Vice Chairman of the Board (1993-1996) and Head of Public Relations (1994-1996). Nevzlin also worked at Group Menatep, focusing on corporate communications, government relations, and human resources. In April 1996 he became Vice President of Yukos, in which Menatep had acquired a 78% share in December 1995.&lt;ref name="lenta"/&gt;

From September 1997 to October 1998, Nevzlin served as first deputy director general of the Russian news agency ITAR TASS, creating a plan to gradually transform it into a joint-stock company.&lt;ref name="lenta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Charity1"/&gt; In April 1998 Nevzlin became First Vice Chairman of Bank Menatep. In 1999 he became First Vice Chairman of the board of directors of Yukos.&lt;ref name=lenta/&gt; From November 2001 to March 2003, he represented the [[Republic of Mordovia]] as a senator in the [[Federation Council of Russia]]. From June to November 2003, he served as the Rector of the [[Russian State University for the Humanities]]. In 2003 and 2004, Nevzlin was featured on Forbes magazine's list of the world’s 100 wealthiest people. In 2010 his wealth was estimated at US$1.3 billion.&lt;ref name="lenta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Charity1"/&gt;

Nevzlin is a co-owner and board member of Haaretz, one of Israel’s liberal newspapers, having purchased a 20% stake in the company in 2011 for 140 million shekels. Members of the Schocken family, descendants of the newspaper’s founders, retain a 60 percent stake in the company.&lt;ref name="Charity1"/&gt; In 2014, Nevzlin founded the monthly Hebrew-language magazine “Liberal,” which publishes analyses of Israeli political life, communications and culture. The inaugural issue appeared in May 2014.&lt;ref name="Reuters2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Davies |first=Megan |date=29 July 2014 |title=Nevzlin not likely to back down in Yukos fight with Russia |newspaper=Reuters |location=Moscow and Tel Aviv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal disputes===
In 2003, following prolonged clashes with the Kremlin, Yukos’ controlling shareholder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and another senior executive, [[Platon Lebedev]], were arrested on charges of fraud and tax evasion. Both were convicted in 2005 following trials that were widely condemned internationally as procedurally flawed and politically motivated.&lt;ref name="VF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="International1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Buckley |first=Neil |date=19 December 2014 |title=Lunch with the FT: Mikhail Khodorkovsk |newspaper=Financial Times |location=London, UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Unfair"&gt;{{cite news |last=Waterfield |first=Bruno |date=25 July 2013 |title=Mikhail Khodorkovsky trial was 'unfair' but not political, rules European court |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/10202131/Mikhail-Khodorkovsky-trial-was-unfair-but-not-political-rules-European-court.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=United Kingdom |access-date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khodorkovsky was found guilty and the sentence for tax evasion and fraud was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights for the same affair. Yukos’ assets were subsequently awarded to state-owned companies in a series of forced auctions. Yukos was declared bankrupt in August 2006.&lt;ref name="WSJ1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ram |first=Vidya |date=1 August 2008 |title=Leonid Nevzlin: The One Who Got Away |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/08/01/nevzlin-khodorkovsky-yukos-face-cx_vr_0801autofacescan01.html |newspaper=Forbes |location=New York, New York |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevzlin left Russia for Israel in 2003. In 2004 the Russian Prosecutor General's Office sought Nevzlin’s extradition over hotly disputed criminal allegations against him related to his tenure at Yukos. The Israeli government rejected the extradition request due to insufficient evidence. Two members of the public who felt aggrieved by the government’s decision sued to have it reversed. They also petitioned the interior minister to revoke Nevzlin’s Israeli citizenship on the grounds that it was obtained under false pretenses. Nevzlin’s attorney, [[David Libai]], argued that the charges against him were the result of political persecution. A spokesman for Nevzlin stated in reaction to extradition request, "Amnesty International, the European Parliament, and the court in the UK, are only some of the bodies that have found that Russian president Vladimir Putin is persecuting Mikhail Khodorovsky, Leonid Nevzlin, and the other shareholders in Yukos, who dared to support democratic opposition parties and openly come out against him. Putin does not hesitate to make use of the Russian authorities that are subordinate to him to create false charges - in the best tradition of the KGB, in which Putin grew up."&lt;ref name="WSJ1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="court"&gt;{{cite news |last=Benaroia |first=Amit |date=15 May 2008 |title=Nevzlin beats extradition |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/nevzlin-beats-extradition-1.245914 |newspaper=Haaretz |location=Israel |accessdate=13 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters2"/&gt;

In May 2008 Israel’s Supreme Court found there was no evidence directly connecting Nevzlin to the criminal allegations made against him. The court rejected extradition and denied the motion to strip Nevzlin of his citizenship. Israel's interior minister and attorney general were ordered to pay Nevzlin’s court costs for this case.&lt;ref name="Reuters2"/&gt; Nevzlin was tried in absentia in Russia in March 2008, found guilty of several counts of conspiracy to murder&lt;ref name=komm.sud&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1109205 Верховный суд признал пожизненное заключение для Леонида Невзлина законным] // [[Коммерсантъ-Online]], 27 января 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120909001040/http://www.rosbalt.ru/2008/08/01/509409.html Невзлина признали убийцей] // [[Росбалт]], 1 августа 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interkavkaz.eu/reportages/nevzlin-nakanune-hodorkovskogo Невзлин накануне Ходорковского] // 17 декабря 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and sentenced to life imprisonment. Nevzlin called the court case a show trial orchestrated by Vladimir Putin.&lt;ref name="WSJ1"/&gt;

In 2014, the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in The Hague, despite the Russian Duma having never ratified the treaty under which this judgment has been made therefore making a non-legally binding judgment, ruled unanimously that the Russian authorities had conducted a “ruthless campaign to destroy Yukos, appropriate its assets and eliminate Mr. [Mikhail] Khodorkovsky as a political opponent.” According to the panel, the forced auction of core parts of the company through contested bankruptcy proceedings “was not driven by motives of tax collection but by the desire of the State to acquire Yukos’ most valuable asset and bankrupt Yukos…. In short, it was in effect a devious and calculated expropriation.”{{cn|date=November 2018}} 

The former Yukos shareholders were awarded damages totaling $50 billion – the largest arbitration award in history. As the biggest shareholder of GML, the former Yukos holding company that brought the legal case, with a 70 per cent stake, Nevzlin stands to be the biggest single beneficiary from The Hague’s ruling. The Russian government failed to meet the deadline of January 15, 2015, for paying that award. Earlier news reports indicated that the former Yukos investors would seek redress by asking U.S. and EU courts to seize Russian-owned assets on their territory.&lt;ref name="WSJ1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Tova |date=28 July 2014 |title=Nevzlin 'very pleased' with Hague court ruling on Yukos |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/07/28/uk-russia-yukos-nevzlin-idUKKBN0FX0SV20140728 |newspaper=Reuters |location=Tel Aviv |access-date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public affairs and philanthropy==
Nevzlin was awarded the Order of Friendship, one of the Russian Federation’s highest honors, for his efforts in supporting Boris Yeltsin’s reelection campaign in 1996.&lt;ref name="lenta"/&gt;

From March to December 2001 Nevzlin served as president of the [[Russian Jewish Congress]]. He was a key player in Jewish historical and heritage research projects, including the establishment of the Moscow Jewish Cultural Center and the International Center for Russian and Eastern European Jewish Studies in Moscow. Moreover, Nevzlin contributed to numerous other Jewish educational programs developed in collaboration with [[World ORT]], the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] and the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]].&lt;ref name="lenta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Charity1"/&gt;

Since moving to Israel, Nevzlin has established the NADAV Foundation, which supports projects in Jewish studies and education, Israel-Diaspora relations and Jewish peoplehood. Its annual “NADAV Peoplehood Prize” has been awarded to such figures as author [[Elie Wiesel]], retired Israeli Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Aharon Barak]], and, most recently, Rabbi [[David Stav]], an Israeli Orthodox rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=224627 |title=Jerusalem Post - Breaking News |publisher=Jpost |date=2013-01-03 |accessdate=2013-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lenta"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nadavfund.org.il/projects |title=Projects |publisher=Nadav fund |accessdate=2013-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125002925/http://www.nadavfund.org.il/projects |archivedate=25 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters2"/&gt;

Nevzlin created the Leonid Nevzlin Research Center for Russian and Eastern European Jewry at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University. He has also served on the boards of both the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv University.&lt;ref name="Charity1"/&gt;

In collaboration with the Israeli government, Nevzlin created a relief fund in 2004 to revive [[Beit Hatfutsot]] – the Museum of the Jewish People, located on the campus of Tel Aviv University, and was elected Chairman of its International Board of Governors. The NADAV Foundation launched the International School for Jewish Peoplehood Studies at Beit Hatfutsot in 2006, and the Nevzlin Center for Jewish Peoplehood at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya in 2010.&lt;ref name="Charity1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cashman |first=Greer Fay |date=8 October 2013 |title=The Grapevine: 20th Anniversary! |url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/In-Thespotlight/The-Grapevine-20th-Anniversary-328188 |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |location=Jerusalem, Israel |access-date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevzlin has served on the Board of Governors of the Jewish Agency for Israel and the Board of Trustees of [[Keren Hayesod]], the [[United Israel Appeal]], and as Associate Chairman of the Board of Directors of the [[Jewish People Policy Planning Institute]].

Nevzlin is also a long-term supporter of Israeli healthcare charity Ezra Lemarpeh.&lt;ref name="Globes"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=הרשת החברתית: בת-ים בדרך להפוך לריביירה של ישראל |url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000988196|newspaper=גלובס |location=Israel|date=23 November 2014 |accessdate=14 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and education==
Nevzlin was born in Moscow on 21 September 1959 into a family of [[Belarusian Jews|Belarusian-Jewish]] origin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://charter97.org/ru/news/2018/8/7/300554/ |title=Леонид Невзлин: Я много встречал в мире выходцев из Беларуси |publisher=[[Charter'97]] |accessdate=2018-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. He graduated from the Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas in 1981, and earned an MA from the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, majoring in management and marketing. Nevzlin has married three times and has five children including [[Irina Nevzlin]], chair of the board of Directors at [[Beit Hatfutsot]].&lt;ref name=lenta/&gt;&lt;ref name="family"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Семейство Невзлиных в Израиле разрастается |url=http://izrus.co.il/oligarhi/article/2012-01-18/16753.html |newspaper=Izrus |location=Israel |date=18 January 2012 |accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Irina, he is the father in law of Israeli politician [[Yuli-Yoel Edelstein]].

In 2014, Nevzlin acquired an apartment in the new, upscale Waldorf-Astoria hotel/apartment complex in the center of Jerusalem at a cost of 40 million shekels (approximately US$11.5 million).&lt;ref name="WA"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bousso |first=Nimrod |date=27 June 2014 |title=Israel’s priciest homes: NIS 120 million for a shore thing |url=http://www.haaretz.com/business/real-estate/.premium-1.601605 |newspaper=Haaretz |location=Israel |access-date=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Nevzlin is the author of the two books “Человек с рублем” (“Man with a Ruble,” coauthored with Mikhail Khodorkovsky), in praise of free-market economics, and “Public Relations – кому это надо?” (“Public Relations – Who Needs Them?”).&lt;ref name=lenta/&gt;&lt;ref name="VF"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= |title=The Wrath of Putin |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/04/vladimir-putin-mikhail-khodorkovsky-russia |newspaper=Vanity Fair |location=New York, New York |access-date=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Masters in Business and Management''' ('''MBM''') is a general category of "[[Master's degree|master]] in business" or "master in management" degrees, usually pursued by students immediately after completing a bachelor's degree (which distinguishes the MBM from the post-experience [[MBA]] degree, which usually requires at least three years of work experience). Common MBM variations include MSc Management and MSc International Management.

The MBM is open to graduates in all fields of the humanities, arts, engineering, science and business. It is designed to equip students with generalist managerial and leadership skills that will improve their practice and help them start a successful career in business management. The curriculum is therefore often very similar to that of an MBA, though the teaching and learning styles may be different in order to account for the variations in prior work experience.

The [[Association of MBAs]] has been accrediting MBM degrees since 2005 and has [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] over 40 programs at international [[business school]]s.

'''Meeting of the minds''' (also referred to as '''mutual agreement''', '''mutual assent''' or '''''consensus ad idem''''') is a phrase in [[Contract|contract law]] used to describe the intentions of the parties forming the contract. In particular, it refers to the situation where there is a common understanding in the formation of the contract. Formation of a contract is initiated with a proposal or offer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningthelaw.in/2016/08/what-is-offer-or-proposal-under.html What is an Offer or proposal under the Contract Law?], available at Learning the Law.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Covenant (law)|condition]] or element is considered a requirement to the formation of a [[contract]] in some jurisdictions.

== History ==
Richard Austen-Baker has suggested that the perpetuation of the idea of 'meeting of minds' may come from a misunderstanding of the Latin term ''consensus ad idem'', which actually means 'agreement to the [same] thing'.&lt;ref&gt;R. Austen-Baker, 'Gilmore and the Strange Case of the Failure of Contract to Die After All' (2002) 18 ''Journal of Contract Law'' 1&lt;/ref&gt; There must be [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] that the parties had each, from an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] perspective, engaged in conduct manifesting their [[wiktionary:assent|assent]], and a contract will be formed when the parties have met such a requirement.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Lord Steyn, 'Contract Law: Fulfilling the Reasonable Expectations of Honest Men' (1997) 113 LQR 433; c.f. § 133 BGB in Germany, where "the actual will of the contracting party, not the literal sense of words, is to be determined"&lt;/ref&gt;

German jurist, [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] is usually credited with developing the [[will theory of contract]] in his work ''[[System des heutigen Römischen Rechts]]'' (1840).&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Carl von Savigny, ''[http://dlib-pr.mpier.mpg.de/m/kleioc/0010/exec/books/%22199236%22 System des heutigen Römischen Rechts]'', 8 vols. (Berlin: Veit, 1840–9) online, in German&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Sir Frederick Pollock]] is one person known for expounding the idea of a contract based on a meeting of minds, at which time it gained much support in the courts.

[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] wrote in 1897 that a meeting of minds was really a fiction.

{{cquote|In the law of contract the use of moral phraseology led to equal confusion, as I have shown in part already, but only in part. Morals deal with the actual internal state of the individual's mind, what he actually intends. From the time of the Romans down to now, this mode of dealing has affected the language of the law as to contract, and the language used has reacted upon the thought. We talk about a contract as a meeting of the minds of the parties, and thence it is inferred in various cases that there is no contract because their minds have not met; that is, because they have intended different things or because one party has not known of the assent of the other. Yet nothing is more certain than that parties may be bound by a contract to things which neither of them intended, and when one does not know of the other's assent. Suppose a contract is executed in due form and in writing to deliver a lecture, mentioning no time. One of the parties thinks that the promise will be construed to mean at once, within a week. The other thinks that it means when he is ready. The court says that it means within a reasonable time. The parties are bound by the contract as it is interpreted by the court, yet neither of them meant what the court declares that they have said. In my opinion no one will understand the true theory of contract or be able even to discuss some fundamental questions intelligently until he has understood that all contracts are formal, that the making of a contract depends not on the agreement of two minds in one intention, but on the agreement of two sets of external signs — not on the parties' having meant the same thing but on their having said the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., [http://www.constitution.org/lrev/owh/path_law.htm 'The Path of the Law'] (1897) 10 ''Harvard Law Review'' 457&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The English contracts scholar Richard Austen-Baker has suggested that the perpetuation of the concept into current times is based on a confusion of it with the concept of a ''consensus ad idem'' ("agreement to the same [thing]") which is an undoubted requirement of [[synallagmatic contracting]], and that this confusion may be the result of recent ignorance of Latin.&lt;ref&gt;R. Austen-Baker, 'Gilmore and the Strange Case of the Failure of Contract to Die After All' (2002) 18 ''Journal of Contract Law'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in case law==
In ''[[Household Fire and Carriage Accident Insurance Co Ltd v Grant]]'' (1879) 4 Ex D 216, [[Thesiger LJ]] said, in the course of a judgment on the [[postal rule]],

{{cquote|Now, whatever in abstract discussion may be said as to the legal notion of its being necessary, in order to the effecting of a valid and binding contract, that the minds of the parties should be brought together at one and the same moment, that notion is practically the foundation of [[English law]] upon the subject of the formation of contracts. Unless therefore a contract constituted by correspondence is absolutely concluded at the moment that the continuing offer is accepted by the person to whom the offer is addressed, it is difficult to see how the two minds are ever to be brought together at one and the same moment...&lt;ref&gt;Thesiger LJ then refers to ''[[Adams v. Lindsell]]'' as supporting this proposition.&lt;/ref&gt; But on the other hand it is a principle of law, as well established as the legal notion to which I have referred, that the minds of the two parties must be brought together by mutual communication. An acceptance, which only remains in the breast of the acceptor without being actually and by legal implication communicated to the offerer, is no binding acceptance.}}

In ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' [1893] 1 QB 256, [[Bowen LJ]] said,

{{cquote|One cannot doubt that, as an ordinary rule of law, an acceptance of an offer made ought to be notified to the person who makes the offer, in order that the two minds may come together. Unless this is done the two minds may be apart, and there is not that consensus which is necessary according to the English law - I say nothing about the laws of other countries - to make a contract.}}

In ''[[Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co. v. United States]]'' (1923)&lt;ref&gt;261 U.S. 592, 597, 58 Ct.Cl. 709, 43 S.Ct. 425, 67 L.Ed. 816  (1923).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[US Supreme Court]] said an [[implied in fact contract]] is,

{{cquote|an agreement ...  founded upon a meeting of minds, which, although not embodied in an express  contract, is inferred, as a fact, from conduct of the parties showing, in the light  of the surrounding circumstances, their tacit understanding.}}

The [[reasoning]] is that a party should not be held to a [[contract]] that they were not even aware existed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} A mutual [[promise]] between friends over simple personal matters should not be a situation where [[legal remedy|legal remedies]] are to be used.  Equally, any such agreement where the obligation is primarily a [[moral obligation|moral]] one rather than a legal one should not be enforceable. It is only when all parties involved are aware of the formation of a ''legal obligation'' is there a meeting of the minds.

However, the awareness of a legal obligation is established, not through each party's subjective understanding of the terms, but on "objective indicators," based on what each party said and did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Texas Contract law | url = http://www.gaddywells.com/TEXAS_CONTRACT_LAW.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ward v. Williams, Court of Appeals of Arkansas | url = http://courts.arkansas.gov/opinions/2002b/20021204/ca011209.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721032945/http://courts.arkansas.gov/opinions/2002b/20021204/ca011209.html | archivedate = 2011-07-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the '''formalist theory of contract''', every contract must have six elements: [[Offer and acceptance#Offer|offer]], [[Offer and acceptance#Acceptance|acceptance]], [[consideration]], ''meeting of the minds'', [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] and [[legality]].  Many other contracts, but not all types of contracts, also must be in writing and be signed by the responsible party, in an element called '''form'''.  {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Vices of consent==
Mutual assent is vitiated by actions such as [[fraud]], [[undue influence]], [[duress]] (see [[per minas]]), [[mutual mistake]], or [[misrepresentation]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} This may render a contract [[Void (law)|void]] or [[unenforceable]].

==Personal life==
Cordúa was born in [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]] and later moved to Houston, Texas. He graduated with a degree in [[Economic]]s and [[Finance]] from [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="AMC"&gt;{{cite news|title=About Michael Cordua |url=http://www.cordua.com/cordua.cfm?a=cms,c,30,5,29 |work=Cordua.com |accessdate=2007-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817055151/http://www.cordua.com/cordua.cfm?a=cms%2Cc%2C30%2C5%2C29 |archivedate=2007-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cordúa worked for a Houston shipping firm until it was liquidated in the late 1980s. After arriving in Houston, Cordúa taught himself to cook, he has said  "The whole reason I got into cooking was because I missed the foods from home".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About the Chef: Michael Cordua |url=http://www.squaremeals.org/vgn/tda/files/2348/8688_Healthy_Helpings.pdf |work=SquareMeals.org |pages=9 |accessdate=2007-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009161541/http://www.squaremeals.org/vgn/tda/files/2348/8688_Healthy_Helpings.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Cordúa, with inspiration from his uncle's restaurant in Managua and despite having no previous experience in the restaurant business, opened his first 130-seat restaurant, ''Churrascos'', on August 8, 1988.&lt;ref name="AMC"/&gt; Churrascos was an upscale South American-style restaurant. Four months in, Cordúa was ready to give up due to the restaurant losing money. Many critics, such as the [[New York Times]], praised the new restaurant and in 1989 Churrascos was listed in [[Esquire magazine]]'s "Best New Restaurants in America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ron |last=Ruggles |title=Americas' fare unites 'continental' divide - international cuisine |url=http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n42_v27/ai_14567673 |work=Nation's Restaurant News |pages=1 |accessdate=2007-10-21 |year=1993 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Smith, a banker from First National Bank, decided to help him expand after eating at his restaurant. Cordúa took the help and opened a second Churrascos near the downtown Houston area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Claire | last=Poole |title=Pass the Chimichurri - Michael Cordua, owner of Churrascos talks of rising popularity of "Nuevo Latino" cuisine | year=1993 |url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BEK/is_11_7/ai_56899206/pg_1 | work =Latin Trade | pages = 1| accessdate = 2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second 175-seat Churrascos was opened in 1990 and emphasized a Central American [[churrasco]] that made up half of its sales. In 1997 Cordúa opened a third Churrascos in [[Chicago]]. It received great reviews from [[critics]], however, after 8 months it closed down when Cordúas partner backed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Claire | last=Poole |title=Pass the Chimichurri - Michael Cordua, owner of Churrascos talks of rising popularity of "Nuevo Latino" cuisine | year=1993 |url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BEK/is_11_7/ai_56899206/pg_2 | work =Latin Trade | pages = 2 | accessdate = 2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cordúa went on to open 3 other [[restaurant]]s; Américas in 1993, Amazón Grill in 1999 (2 locations) and Artista in 2002, all of which have received various awards.&lt;ref name="AMC"/&gt; Cordúa opened another location for his Américas restaurant in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cordúa Wins Big at 14th Annual Houston Culinary Awards |url=http://www.thewoodlandscvb.com/news/_2010/10-October/October14americas.asp |publisher=The Woodlands Convention and Visitors Bureau |accessdate=22 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222201444/http://thewoodlandscvb.com/news/_2010/10-October/October14americas.asp |archivedate=22 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and also owns a [[catering]] company, Cordúa  catering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Best New Chefs (1994): Michael Cordua |url =http://www.foodandwine.com/bestnewchefs/?year=1994&amp;chef=5C80EAAE-32FF-41CE-972B9B30E9487B37 | work =Food and Wine | accessdate = 2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
Cordúa and his restaurants have received much recognition and many awards throughout the years.

'''Our Generation Speaks''' ('''OGS''') is a fellowship program and startup incubator whose mіѕѕіоn іѕ to bring together young [[Israelis|Israeli]] and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] leaders through entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ogspeaks.com/about-ogs|title=Our Generation Speaks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OGS works in partnership with the [[Heller School for Social Policy and Management]] ([[Brandeis University]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heller.brandeis.edu/about/ourgenerationspeaks/|title=Our Generation Speaks – The Heller School at Brandeis University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MassChallenge]] &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirsner|first1=Scott|title=Can entrepreneurship bridge the Israeli-Palestinian gap?|url=http://www.betaboston.com/news/2016/03/10/can-enterpeneurship-bridge-the-israeli-palestinian-gap/|publisher=The Boston Globe - BetaBoston|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to give OGS Fellows the tools to develop businesses that generate significant social and economic value in the [[Middle East]].

== Structure ==
OGS teaches business development, financial management, marketing strategy, and conflict-resolution to young adults aged 21–30. The fellowship runs over the course of three months in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]] and includes daily classes taught by Brandeis University professors, one-on-one mentoring, and workshops. During the summer, the fellows work in teams to build sustainable businesses that will benefit their home communities. The fellowship operates entirely in English and provides each group of fellows with the skills and network to enact change in their communities. Each business developed through OGS receives seed funding at the end of the fellowship to aid in their launch and operations upon return to Israel and Palestine.

OGS Fellows remain connected through the OGS Alumni Organization, which plans a number of annual activities, including group trips in Israel and Palestine, meetings with local leaders, and trainings focused on career and leadership development. The organization will host an annual conference for current fellowship participants and the growing group of alumni over time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Work|url=http://www.ogspeaks.com|website=Our Generation Speaks|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OGS Fellows are exceptional young adults from both Israel and Palestine. OGS uses entrepreneurship to bring together people from these communities, which in turn works toward building trust and enacting social and economic change. Each year, OGS aims to maintain a 1:1 ratio of Israeli and Palestinians, as well as female and male fellows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/his-generation-speaks-qa-with-social-entrepreneur_us_585883a0e4b0d5f48e165242|title=Their Generation Speaks: Q&amp;A With Social Entrepreneur, Ohad Elhelo|first=Yuval|last=Rabin|date=19 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fellowship is fully funded for the fellows.

== History ==
Our Gеnеrаtіоn Speaks wаѕ fоundеd by Brandeis University student [[Ohad Elhelo]] in 2014. Since its founding, OGS has received financial support and advising from оvеr fіftу independent American, Pаlеѕtіnіаn, and Iѕrаеlі dоnоrѕ whо ѕhаrе its gоаlѕ and vаluеѕ,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; including the Kraft Family ([[the Kraft Group]]), former Governor of Massachusetts [[Deval Patrick]], Hаnі Alаmі, a Palestinian telecommunications еntrерrеnеur, and Aron Ain, сhіеf еxесutіvе of [[Kronos Incorporated]]. Former Governor [[Deval Patrick]] ([[Massachusetts]]) currently serves as the Chairman of the OGS Advisory Board, alongside [[Robert Kraft]] who serves as Honorary Chairman.

Our Gеnеrаtіоn Sреаkѕ has since lаunсhеd thrее ѕtаrtuрѕ in Jеruѕаlеm &amp; Rаmаllаh as of September 2016, and expects to launch at least 3 to 4 each year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each OGS startup receives seed funding from OGS to establish themselves in Israel and Palestine. Some of the startups have also raised funds independently of OGS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/12/israel-bedouin-genetic-disease-family-doctor.html|title=Bedouin woman battles genetic diseases in Israel's Negev|date=2016-12-30|work=Al-Monitor|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardbehar/2017/03/21/backed-by-big-wheels-a-boston-incubator-hooks-up-young-israelis-and-palestinians-to-launch-startups/#5655e0d46424|title=Backed By Big Wheels, A Boston Incubator Hooks Up Young Israelis And Palestinians To Launch Startups|last=Behar|first=Richard|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Perth Metropolitan Markets''' were a fruit and vegetable wholesale markets located at 840 (Lots 500-504) [[Wellington Street, Perth|Wellington Street]] in [[West Perth, Western Australia|West Perth]] from 1929 to 1989, when they moved to their current site in [[Canning Vale, Western Australia|Canning Vale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perthmarket.com.au/historicalphotogallery.php?PageNumber=7 Perth Market City Historical Photo Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;

The markets were originally established at [[Roe Street, Perth]], at the western end of the railway station (regularly referred to as the "Old Markets"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Roberts, L.

By the 1950s protective restrictions on road transport by the Road Transport Regulation Board were being lightened, and more trucking of produce into and away from the markets was beginning to have effect on Wellington Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Western Australia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2783">'''Pieter Corbeels''' ([[Leuven]], 12 March 1755 – [[Tournai]], 21 June 1799) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] book printer and resistance leader. He was a founder of the Belgian based publishing company [[Brepols]]. He commanded part of the [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantine]] forces during a revolt against the French Revolutionary regime known as the ''[[Peasants' War (1798)|Boerenkrijg]]'' ("Peasants' War"). For his role in the war he was executed.

==Service in Austrian Army==

Corbeels, was a corporal in the [[Austria]]n army. He fought in the rebel army of [[Jean-André van der Mersch]], who won the [[Battle of Turnhout (1789)|Battle of Turnhout]] against the Austrians in 1789. After the defeat of the [[Brabant Revolution]], he started a printing business in Leuven in 1790. He established his printing business in the Gommarushuis in the Tiensestraat in Leuven. Corbeels printed besides the ordinary, ordered printed papers, also a large number of inciting leaflets and almanacs. For this he was arrested by the French, on 28 November 1792, and transferred to [[Valenciennes]] in France. On 15 December 1792, he was released whereupon he resumed printing. In 1793 he moved into the house called ''Hertog van Brabant'' on the ''Grote Markt'' of Leuven. In 1796, he moved with his wife, Barbara Panz, and assistant, [[Philippus Jacobus Brepols]], to [[Turnhout]], where he was less impeded by the French. On 16 September 1797, his wife died and on 31 October he remarried with Joanna Antonia Servaes.

==Life in Turnhout and Peasants War== 

Corbeels remarried while living in Turnhout, and he left Turnhout in the summer of 1798 as a leader of the ''Boerenkrijg'' also known as the [[Peasants' War (1798)]] against the French. &lt;ref&gt;http://historiek.net/de-boerenkrijg/8675/&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 November 1798, he was caught in Postel and taken by the French, whereupon he ended up in the prison, and was executed, together with Albert Meulemans, on 21 June 1799 in Tournai.

His widow initially continued the printing business, together with Philippus Jacobus Brepols. But in 1800 he bought the business from her. The [[Brepols]] printing business in Turnhout, grew out of this.

In marketing, '''promotion''' refers to any type of [[marketing communications|marketing communication]] used to inform or persuade target audiences of the relative merits of a product, service, brand or issue. The aim of promotion is to  increase awareness, create interest, generate sales or create [[brand loyalty]].  It is one of the basic elements of the [[market mix]], which includes the four P's ,i.e., Product, Price, Place, Promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing. A Managerial Approach |year=1964| publisher=Irwin| location=Homewood, IL|isbn=0256025339|pages=769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promotion is also one of the elements in the [[promotional mix]] or promotional plan. These are [[personal selling]], [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], [[direct marketing]] [[publicity]] and may also include [[event-driven marketing|event marketing]], [[exhibition]]s and trade shows.&lt;ref name="Raj"&gt;{{cite book | author=Rajagopal | title=Marketing dynamics theory and practice | publisher=New Age International | location=New Delhi | year=2007 | isbn=978-81-224-2712-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A promotional plan specifies how much attention to pay to each of the elements in the promotional mix, and what proportion of the budget should be allocated to each element.

Promotion covers the methods of communication that a marketer uses to provide information about its product. Information can be both verbal and visual.

==Etymology and usage==

The term, "promotion' derives from the Old French, ''promocion'' meaning to "move forward", "push onward" or to "advance in rank or position" which in turn, comes from the Latin, ''promotionem'' meaning "a moving forward". The word entered the English language in the 14th century. &lt;ref&gt;''Online Etymology Encyclopedia,'' &lt;Online: {{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/promotion |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-01-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108174811/https://www.etymonline.com/word/promotion |archivedate=2018-01-08 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the term promotion to refer to "advertising or publicity" is very modern and is first recorded in 1925. &lt;ref&gt;Online Etymology Encyclopedia, &lt;Online: {{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/promotion |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-01-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108174811/https://www.etymonline.com/word/promotion |archivedate=2018-01-08 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It may be a contraction of a related term, ''sales promotion,'' which is one element in the larger set of tools used in marketing communications. The terms, ''promotion'' and ''marketing communications'' can be used synonymously, but in practice, the latter is more widely used. &lt;ref&gt;Pickton, D. and Broderick, A. ''Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Harlow, Essex, Pearson, 2005, pp 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
There are three objectives of promotion. These are:&lt;ref name="kurtz"&gt;{{cite book | last=Boone | first=Louis |last2= Kurtz|first2=David | title=Contemporary marketing | publisher=Dryden Press | location=Hinsdale, Ill | year=1974 | isbn=978-0-03-088518-1 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# To present information to consumers and others. 
# To increase [[demand]]. 
# To differentiate a product.
The purpose of a promotion and thus its promotional plan can have a wide range, including: sales increases, new product acceptance, creation of [[brand equity]], [[positioning (marketing)|positioning]], competitive retaliations, or creation of a [[Corporate identity|corporate image]].&lt;ref name=Raj/&gt;

The term 'promotion' tends to be used internally by the marketing function. To the public or the market, phrases like "[[special offer]]" are more common. Examples of a fully integrated, long-term, and large-scale promotion are [[My Coke Rewards]] in the USA or [[Coke Zone]] in the UK and [[Pepsi Stuff]].

==Types==
There have been different ways to promote a product in person or with different media. Both person and media can be either physically real or virtual/electronic.
 
===In a physical environment===
Promotions can be held in physical environments at special events such as [[concert]]s, festivals, [[trade show]]s, and in the field, such as in grocery or department stores. Interactions in the field allow immediate purchases. The purchase of a product can be [[incentive]] with [[discounts and allowances|discount]]s (i.e., coupons), free items, or a contest. This method is used to increase the sales of a given product. 
Interactions between the brand and the customer are performed by a [[brand ambassador]] or [[promotional model]] who represents the product in physical environments. Brand ambassadors or promotional models are hired by a [[marketing company]], which in turn is booked by the brand to represent the product or service. Person-to-person interaction, as opposed to media-to-person involvement, establishes connections that add another dimension to promotion. [[community building|Building a community]] through promoting goods and services can lead to [[brand loyalty]].

===Traditional media===
Examples of traditional media include print media such as [[newspaper]]s and magazines, electronic media such as radio and [[television]], and outdoor media such as banner or [[billboard]] advertisements. Each of these platforms provide ways for brands to reach consumers with advertisements.

=== Digital media ===

Digital media, which includes Internet, [[social networking]] and [[social media]] sites, is a modern way for brands to interact with consumers as it releases news, information and advertising from the technological limits of print and broadcast infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;Mulhern, Frank (2009). "Integrated marketing communications: From media channels to digital connectivity". ''Journal of Marketing Communications'' '''15''' (2-3): 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital media is currently the most effective way for brands to reach their consumers on a daily basis. Over 2.7 billion people are online globally, which is about 40% of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Simon; Huang, Li; Roth, Martin S.; Madden, Thomas J. "The influence of social media interactions on consumer–brand relationships: A three-country study of brand perceptions and marketing&lt;/ref&gt; 67% of all Internet users globally use social media.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Simon; Roth, Martin S.; Madden, Thomas J.; Hudson, Rupert (2015-04-01). "The effects of social media on emotions, brand relationship quality, and word of mouth: An empirical study of music festival attendees". ''Tourism Management'' '''47''': 68–76. {{doi|10.1016/j.tourman.2014.09.001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mass communication]] has led to modern marketing strategies to continue focusing on brand awareness, large distributions and heavy promotions.&lt;ref&gt;Mulhern, Frank (2009). "Integrated marketing communications: From media channels to digital connectivity". ''Journal of Marketing Communications'' '''15''' (2-3): 85. doi:10.1080/13527260902757506.&lt;/ref&gt; The fast-paced environment of digital media presents new methods for promotion to utilize new tools now available through technology. With the rise of technological advances, promotions can be done outside of local contexts and across geographic borders to reach a greater number of potential consumers. The goal of a promotion is then to reach the most people possible in a time efficient and a cost efficient manner.

Social media, as a modern marketing tool, offers opportunities to reach larger audiences in an interactive way. These interactions allow for conversation rather than simply educating the customer. [[Facebook]], [[Snapchat]], [[Instagram]], [[Twitter]], [[Pinterest]], [[Google Plus]], [[Tumblr]], as well as alternate audio and media sites like [[SoundCloud]] and [[Mixcloud]] allow users to interact and promote music online with little to no cost. You can purchase and buy ad space as well as potential customer interactions stores as [[Like button|Likes]], Followers, and clicks to your page with the use of third parties. As a participatory media culture, social media platforms or social networking sites are forms of mass communication that, through media technologies, allow large amounts of product and distribution of content to reach the largest audience possible.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; However, there are downsides to virtual promotions as servers, systems, and websites may crash, fail, or become overloaded with information. You also can stand risk of losing uploaded information and storage and at a use can also be effected by a number of outside variables.

Brands can explore different strategies to keep consumers engaged. One popular tool is branded entertainment, or creating some sort of social game for the user. The benefits of such a platform include submersing the user in the brand's content. Users will be more likely to absorb and not grow tired of advertisements if they are, for example, embedded in the game as opposed to a bothersome pop-up ad.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, C., &amp; Tuten, T. (2015). Creative Strategies in Social Media Marketing: An Exploratory Study of Branded Social Content and Consumer Engagement. ''Psychology &amp; Marketing'', 32(1), 15-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personalizing advertisements]] is another strategy that can work well for brands, as it can increase the likelihood that the brand will be anthropomorphized by the consumer. Personalization increases click-through intentions when data has been collected about the consumer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Aguirre, Elizabeth; Mahr, Dominik; Grewal, Dhruv; de Ruyter, Ko; Wetzels, Martin (2015-03-01). "Unraveling the Personalization Paradox: The Effect of Information Collection and Trust-Building Strategies on Online Advertisement Effectiveness". ''Journal of Retailing'' '''91''' (1): 34–49. doi:10.1016/j.jretai.2014.09.005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brands must navigate the line between effectively promoting their content to consumers on social media and becoming too invasive in consumers' lives. Vivid Internet ads that include devices such as [[animation]] might increase a user's initial attention to the ad. However, this may be seen as a distraction to the user if they are trying to absorb a different part of the site such as reading text.&lt;ref&gt;Celebi, Serra Inci. "How do motives affect attitudes and behaviors toward internet advertising and Facebook advertising?". ''[[Computers in Human Behavior]]'' '''51''': 312–324. doi:10.1016/j.chb.2015.05.011.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, when brands make the effort of overtly collecting data about their consumers and then personalizing their ads to them, the consumer's relationship with the advertisements, following this data collection, is frequently positive. However, when data is covertly collected, consumers can quickly feel like the company betrayed their trust.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is important for brands to utilize personalization in their ads, without making the consumer feel vulnerable or that their [[internet privacy|privacy]] [[privacy breach|has been betrayed]].

Tan Sri Abdul '''Rashid Hussain''' (born 1946 [[Singapore]]) is an entrepreneur in [[Malaysia]]. He is the founder of RHB Group. In less than a decade, he built a financial services conglomerate comprising a stockbroking firm, a commercial bank, a finance company and a merchant bank-[[RHB Bank]]. He began his financial services career in 1971 with Strauss Turnbull in Britain and returned to Malaysia in 1975 to work in Bumiputra Merchant Bankers Bhd. He then left Bumiputra Merchant Bankers in 1983 to start Rashid Hussain Securities. Under his stewardship, RHB Securities became one of the leading stockbrokers in Malaysia.

Hussain was the Chairman of Putrajaya Holdings Sdn Bhd from 1995 to 2000 and served as a board member and Chairman of the Executive Committee of [[Khazanah Nasional]] Berhad from 1994 to 1998.

He was married to a daughter of [[Robert Kuok]]. Hussain is the youngest son of Mohammed Hussain, who hailed from Penang and who later moved to Singapore and developed a successful business there. His mother is of Malay and Arab descent.

'''Sisense''' is a [[business analytics]] software company with offices in [[New York City]], [[Tel Aviv]], and [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]. Its [[business intelligence]] product includes both a back-end powered by in-chip technology that enables non-technical users to join and analyze [[big data|large data sets]] from multiple sources,&lt;ref name=ForbesMarch13 /&gt; and a front-end for creating [[data visualization|visualizations]], like dashboards and reports, on any device, including mobile.&lt;ref name=IncJune13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NextWebApril13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=FierceOct12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DataInformedAugust12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GigaomApril13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NocamelsApril13 /&gt;

== History ==
Sisense was founded in 2004 in Tel Aviv by Elad Israeli, Eldad Farkash, Aviad Harell, Guy Boyangu and Adi Azaria.&lt;ref name=Haaretz /&gt; The company worked in stealth mode on research and development until 2010, when initial investors, including [[Genesis Partners]], [[Opus Capital]] and Eli Farkash, provided $4 million in [[Series A round|Series A financing]].&lt;ref name=Haaretz /&gt;&lt;ref name=CrunchBase /&gt;

Amit Bendov was appointed CEO in July 2012.&lt;ref name=SVBJ12 /&gt; In April 2013, Sisense announced a $10 million [[Series B round|series B funding round]] led by [[Battery Ventures]], with participation from Genesis Partners and Opus Capital. In June 2014, new investor [[Draper Fisher Jurvetson]] Growth (DFJ Growth) led a $30 million series C funding round with participation from existing investors Battery Ventures, Genesis Partners and Opus Capital.&lt;ref name=TechCrunchJune14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJjune14 /&gt;

In February 2013, as the first company in [[TechCrunch#CrunchBase|CrunchBase's]] "Developer Spotlight Program,"&lt;ref name="ForbesMarch13" /&gt; Sisense analyzed 10 years of CrunchBase data in a public interactive investment dashboard dubbed CrunchAnalytics.&lt;ref name="SisenseCB" /&gt; By analyzing a decade's worth of data about 100,000 companies, the dashboard provides the public with a research tool that enables users to query the data by different categories to see trends in investment over the past ten years.&lt;ref name="ForbesMarch13" /&gt;

In 2015, Amir Orad was appointed CEO. Orad previously served as CEO of [[NICE Actimize]].&lt;ref name="EnterpriseappstodayMarch2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/business-intelligence/startup-spotlight-sisenses-big-data-analytics.html|title=Startup Spotlight: Sisense’s Big Data Analytics|last=All|first=Ann|date=20 March 2015|work=Enterprise Apps Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GeektimeMarch2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.geektime.com/2015/03/23/from-a-145m-exit-to-ceo-of-sisense-amir-orad-could-lead-this-big-data-company-to-a-grand-future/|title=From a $145M exit to CEO of Sisense, Amir Orad could lead this big data company to a grand future|last=Weinglas|first=Simona|date=March 23, 2015|work=Geek Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geektime.com/2015/03/23/from-a-145m-exit-to-ceo-of-sisense-amir-orad-could-lead-this-big-data-company-to-a-grand-future/|title=From a $145M exit to CEO of Sisense, Amir Orad could lead this big data company to a grand future|date=2015-03-23|work=Geektime|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, the company announced a new $50 million funding round led by [[Bessemer Venture Partners]], with participation by  Battery Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Genesis Partners and Opus Capital.&lt;ref name="WSJJan16"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2016/01/07/under-new-ceo-sisense-raises-50m/|title=Under New CEO, Sisense Raises $50M|last=Gage|first=Deborah|date=January 7, 2016|work=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's software is used by companies in 49 countries.&lt;ref name="NextWebApril13" /&gt; Customers include [[Target Corporation|Target]].&lt;ref name="WSJnov12" /&gt; In February 2018, the company was listed as a Visionary on the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms.&lt;ref name="Gartner18" /&gt;

In September 2018, the company announced another $80 million funding round led by Insight Venture Partners.&lt;ref name="80funding" /&gt;

== Technology ==
In April 2013, Sisense introduced an alternative to [[in-memory database|in-memory technology]] called In-Chip analytics,&lt;ref name=InfoNov13 /&gt; designed to maximize the disk, memory and CPU with resulting low latency.&lt;ref name=GigaomApril13 /&gt;

In May 2013, Sisense unveiled Prism 10X, which allows users to analyze 100 times more data at 10 times the speed of in-memory solutions. The company’s In-Chip Analytics technology couples a columnar database with smart algorithms that use the in-chip cache, RAM or disk as needed instead of relying solely on RAM or disk.&lt;ref name=KDNuggetsMay13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BusinessIntelligenceNov13 /&gt;

In October 2013, Sisense introduced Crowd Accelerated BI,&lt;ref name=BusinessIntelligenceNov13 /&gt; a technology that allows companies to scale users by providing faster query results as load increases and scale to thousands of simultaneous users on a single box.&lt;ref name=DataNamiOct13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DatabaseOct13 /&gt;

Each query is broken down to its basic components, which then helps the software decide which data to store on disk and which data to bring to memory. As more queries are catalogued, the software is able to more quickly recognize future similar queries and call up relevant data.&lt;ref name=ForbesOct13 /&gt;

In April 2017, Sisense introduced Sisense Pulse which provides alert when it detects results outside of normal parameters for a particular metric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/sisense-pulse-uses-machine-learning-to-trigger-data-anomaly-alerts/|title=Sisense Pulse uses machine learning to trigger data anomaly alerts – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Skift, Inc.''' is a media company founded in 2012 that provides news, research, and marketing services for the travel industry. It was founded by Rafat Ali and Jason Clampet.

The name Skift, which means "shift" or "transformation" in [[North Germanic languages|Nordic languages]], was chosen by Ali and Clampet to highlight the ongoing changes in the future of travel.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite news |date= |title=About Skift |url=https://skift.com/about/ |agency=Skift }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In July 2012, Rafat Ali founded Skift and assumed the role of CEO. Co-founder Jason Clampet, formerly of [[Frommer's]], joined as Skift's head of content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=July 30, 2012 |title=4 Years After PaidContent's $12.5 Million Acquisition, Rafat Ali Is Founding A New Media Company, Skift |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/rafat-ali-and-jason-clampet-launch-travel-intelligence-startup-skift-2012-7 |newspaper=Business Insider }}&lt;/ref&gt; For its launch, Skift raised about $500,000 in funding from investors, including [[L.

'''Station F''' is a [[business incubator]] for startups, located in [[13th arrondissement of Paris]]. Noted as the world's largest startup facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Medeiros|first1=João|title=Station F, the world's largest startup campus opens in Paris|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/station-f|accessdate=21 August 2017|work=Wired|date=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Situated in a former rail freight depot previously known as la [[Halle Freyssinet]] (thereof the "F" in Station F). The 34,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; facility was formally opened by President [[Emmanuel Macron]] in June 2017 and provides office accommodation for up to 1,000 start-up and early stage businesses as well as for corporate partners such as Facebook, [[Microsoft]] and [[Naver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Agnew|first1=Harriet|title=Technology: Macron thinks big in his vision for French unicorns|url=https://www.ft.com/content/61c5f20a-81a8-11e7-a4ce-15b2513cb3ff|accessdate=21 August 2017|work=Financial Times|date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Building facilities==
Station F occupies a building designed by French engineer [[Eugène Freyssinet]]. First opened in 1929 the former rail depot has been extensively remodeled by architects [[Jean-Michel Wilmotte|Wilmotte]] and Associates to meet the needs of small start-up companies. 

As well as 3,000 desk spaces and private meeting facilities, the incubator also hosts a 370-seat auditorium and dining facilities open to the public. Facebook's own Startup Garage in the building will host up to 15 companies on a six monthly cycle and represents the company's first physical space dedicated to startups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burgess|first1=Matt|title=More than 100 entrepreneurs sign up to help Facebook and Station F find the best startups|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/station-f-facebook-startup-garage-startups|accessdate=21 August 2017|work=Wired|date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19714">'''Team management''' is the ability of an individual or an organization to administer and coordinate a group of individuals to perform a task. Team management involves teamwork, communication, objective setting and performance appraisals. Moreover, team management is the capability to identify problems and resolve conflicts within a team. There are various methods and leadership styles a team manager can take to increase personnel productivity and build an effective team.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary. Team Management. [Online]. [Accessed 15 October 2014]. Available from:http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/team-management.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of a healthy and successful team==

===Cohesive leadership===
In any functional team, cohesion amongst team leaders and decision makers is vital. Cohesive leadership means that team leaders are acting together as a unit and making decisions as a leadership team instead of each branching off into their own work and operating individually. This will ensure that the team will be steered in one direction instead of multiple due to team leaders not being concise and consistent with their instructions. Cohesive leadership will require team leaders to have strong communication skills. 
&lt;ref name ="IESE Business School"&gt;IESE Business School. 2011. Patrick Lencioni: The Four Traits of Healthy Teams. [Online]. [Accessed 15 October 2014]. Available from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KxJop0A0vA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effective communication===
There must be an effective [[channel of communication]] from the top to the bottom of the [[chain of command]] and vice versa. An effective channel of communication will allow messages to be transferred accurately without delay to the intended recipient, this will speed up decision making processes and the operations of the team. Furthermore, effective communication will increase the flexibility of an organisation and cause it to be less susceptible to changes in the external environment; as a faster decision making process will allow organisations a longer time period to adapt to the changes and execute contingency plans.&lt;ref name="IESE Business School"/&gt;

===Common goal===
When team members first come together they will all have different ideas, however the key to a successful team is the alignment of objectives within the team. It is essential that the team leader sets a common goal the entire team is willing to pursue. This way, all the team members will put in effort in order to attain the goal. If there is not a common goal, team members who disagree with the objective in hand will feel reluctant to utilise their full effort, leading to failure to achieve the goal. In other cases, team members might divert themselves to other tasks due to a lack of belief or interest in the goal.&lt;ref&gt;Abudi, G. 2011. 5 Elements of Successful Project Teams. [Online]. [Accessed 15 October 2014]. Available from: http://quickbase.intuit.com/blog/2011/08/05/5-elements-of-successful-project-teams/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defined team roles and responsibilities===
Poorly defined roles is often the biggest obstacle to a successful Team.&lt;ref&gt;Traxia Partners, Inc. Discovering Your Team Leadership Style. [Online]. [Accessed 15 October 2014]. Available from:http://www.triaxiapartners.com/corp/team/learning-solutions/discovering-your-team-leadership-style&lt;/ref&gt; If team members are unclear of what their role is, their contributions towards the team will be minimal, therefore it is the team leader's duty to outline the roles and responsibilities of each individual within the team and ensure that the team is working together as an integral unit.

In a successful team, a team leader will first evaluate the mission of the team to understand what is needed to accomplish the task. Then, they will identify the strengths and weaknesses of their team members and assign roles accordingly. Lastly, they must ensure that all team members know what each other's responsibilities are to avoid confusion and to create an effective channel of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Human Resource Development Quarterly. 2008. Defining Team Roles and Responsibilities. [Instructor Guide]. Pennsylvania: Human Resource Development Quarterly.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of team management==

==="Command and Control"===
The method “Command and Control” as an approach to team management is based on the concept of military management. “Command and Control” was a commonly used system in the private sector during the 20th century.&lt;ref name ="Out and In"&gt;Plotczyk, P.; Murphy, S. Command and Control is OUT! Create and Engage is IN! [Online]. [Accessed 15 October 2014]. Available from:http://www.wsa-intl.com/278-this-month-s-articles/command--control-is-out-engage-create-is-in/&lt;/ref&gt; In this method, the team leader instructs their team members to complete a task and if they refuse, they will yell or punish them until they no longer refuse and comply with the instructions. The team leader has absolute authority and utilises an [[#Autocratic|autocratic]] leadership style.There are considerable drawbacks to this team management method. Firstly, the team morale will be lowered due to team members being constantly belittled by the team leader at the slightest mistake; punishments will also lead to a lack of confidence in team members resulting in poor performance. Second, in modern organisations roles are often specialised, therefore managers will require the expertise of the employee, elevating the value of the employee. Implementing the “Command and Control” team management method will lead to a high rate of employee turnover. In addition, in large organisations managers don’t have the time to provide instructions to all employees and continuously monitor them, this will impede an organisations performance as managers are not spending time on their core responsibilities.&lt;ref name ="Three Management Methods"&gt;Spolsky, J. 2006. Three Management Methods (Introduction).[Online]. [Accessed 15 October 2014]. Available from: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/07.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Engage and Create"===
Due to the limitations and ineffectiveness of “Command and Control”, managers developed an alternative management strategy known as “Engage and Create”. In this method team members are encouraged to participate in discussions and contribute. Furthermore, they are advised to engage with other team members to build a stronger sense of teamwork and unity. This will lead to increased productivity and accountability of each team member, driving the team towards success.&lt;ref name="Out and In"/&gt;

==="Econ 101"===
In the “Econ 101” method of team management, the team leader makes the baseline assumption that all team members are motivated by reward in the form of money, and that the best way to manage the team is to provide financial rewards for performance and issue punishments for failure. This method of team management uses material gains in the place of intrinsic motivation to drive team members. This is similar to Taylor's theory of [[Scientific Management]] where he claims the main form of motivation for employees is money.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, J. 2012. Motivation Theory - Taylor.[Online]. [Accessed 15 October 2014]. Available from:http://www.tutor2u.net/business/people/motivation_theory_taylor.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoang, P. 2011. International Baccalaureate Business and Management. Edition 2.IBID Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The main drawback of this method is that it does not take into account other forms of motivation besides money such as personal satisfaction and ambition. Moreover, by using reward and punishment as a method of team management it can cause demotivation as everyone is motivated by different factors and there is no one way to satisfy all team members, the negative effect is further compounded by punishment leading to demoralisation and lost of confidence.&lt;ref name="Three Management Methods"/&gt;

==Problems in team management==

===Absence of trust===
In Patrick Lencioni's book [[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team]], the absence of vulnerability-based trust – where team members are comfortable being vulnerable with each other, trust each other to help when asking for guidance, and are willing to admit their mistakes – within a team is detrimental to a team. Team leaders have to assist each other when they are vulnerable and also allow team members to see their vulnerable side, which is contradictory to the orthodox belief. If a team lacks vulnerability based trust, team members will not be willing to share ideas or acknowledge their faults due to the fear of being exposed as incompetent, leading to a lack of communication and the hindering of the team.&lt;ref name ="The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Book"&gt;Lencioni, P. 2002. The Five Dysfunctions of a Team. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Slideshare"&gt;Slideshare. 2012. The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni.[Online]. [Accessed 15 October 2014]. Available from:http://www.slideshare.net/peterdschwartz/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-by-patrick-lencioni-slides&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Video"&gt;SamitiAlbania. 2011. Patrick Lencioni: Five Dysfunctions Of a Team.wmv. [Online]. [Accessed 15 October 2014]. Available from:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sqvWEI1CVg&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fear of conflict===
Contrary to the general belief, conflict is a positive element in a team as it drives discussion. The fear of conflict is the fear of team members to argue with one another and the fear of disagreeing with the team leader. If team members hold back and are afraid of confronting the leader or their teammates, then the concept of a team is non-existent because there is only one person who contributes and no new ideas are generated from discussions.&lt;ref name="The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Book"/&gt;

The fear of conflict in a team stems from an absence of trust, more specifically vulnerability based trust. If team members are afraid to be vulnerable in front of one another, disputes can be manipulative and a means to overthrow and shame the other team member. However, if team members trust each other and are comfortable being vulnerable in front of one another, then debates can be a pursuit of a better and more effective method to achieve a task.&lt;ref name="The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slideshare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Video"/&gt;

===Lack of commitment===
When team members don’t provide input on a decision, it shows that they do not agree or approve of the decision, leading to a halt in team activity and progress. Furthermore, when team members don’t express their opinions, views and potential ideas are lost, hurting the project and the company.&lt;ref name="The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Video"/&gt;

===Avoidance of accountability===
The avoidance of accountability in a team is the failure of team members to be accountable for the consequences of their actions. When team members do not commit to a decision, they will be unwilling to take responsibility for the outcomes of the decision.&lt;ref name="The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Book"/&gt;

In addition, if a lack of trust exists within the team then there will be an absence of peer to peer accountability; team members will not feel accountable towards their team members and hence will not put effort into their tasks. The team must trust and hold each other responsible so that the intention will always be for the benefit of the team and for the team to succeed.&lt;ref name="The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Book"/&gt;

Team leaders who are afraid of confrontation might avoid holding team members accountable when in fact they have made a mistake. Team leaders must develop the confidence to hold team members accountable so that they will feel the sense of responsibility and entitlement to the team, and learn from their mistakes. If not, then errors will not be corrected and might lead to worse problems, causing a defective team.&lt;ref name="The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Video"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haudan, J. Peer Accountability - A Powerful Performance Driver.[Online]. [Accessed 15 October 2014]. Available from: http://watercoolernewsletter.com/peer-accountability-a-powerful-performance-driver/#.VEAv0OfzQfF&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inattention to results===
If team leaders and team members do not hold each other accountable then they will not be concerned about the outcome of the team and whether they have achieved their goal, as they do not have a drive to obtain great results. Inattention to results causes a loss of purpose and brings into question the existence of the team.&lt;ref name="The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Book"/&gt;

==Resolving problems through team management==

===Building trust===
An approach to resolving fundamental trust problems within teams is to build trust amongst team members. A team leader can build trust by persuading team members to ask questions and seek guidance from other team members, so that they are more familiar and comfortable in being vulnerable with one another, questions such as “May you teach me how to do this” or “You are better than me at this”. However, in order to achieve vulnerability based trust within the team the team leader must be vulnerable first, if the team leader is unwilling to be vulnerable, nobody else in the team will be willing to follow.&lt;ref name="The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Book"/&gt;

===Appraisals===
Appraisals can be a way for team members to provide feedback to one another or for team members to provide advice to the leader. This will allow individual members of the team to reflect on their performance and aim to do better by amending their mistakes; furthermore appraisals create an environment where the chain of command is non-existent and team members can be honest towards one another. This is effective in a way that the team can provide progressive feedback towards other members and can advise the leader on how he or she can improve their leadership. After each member reads their appraisals, they will understand how they can strive to improve, benefitting the team in reaching its objectives. The commonly used forms of appraisals are [[performance appraisals]], [[peer appraisals]] and [[360 degree feedback]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray, C. Team vs Individual Performance Appraisals.[Online]. [Accessed 15 October 2014]. Available from: http://smallbusiness.chron.com/team-vs-individual-performance-appraisals-20040.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Team building activities===
Team-building activities are a series of simple exercises involving teamwork and communication. The main objectives of team building activities are to increase the trust amongst team members and allow team members to better understand one another. When choosing or designing team building activities it is best to determine if your team needs an event or an experience.  Generally an event is fun, quick and easily done by non-professionals.  Team building experiences provide richer, more meaningful results. Experiences should be facilitated by a professional on an annual basis for teams that are growing, or changing.

====&lt;!-- Are these examples necessary? --&gt;Back to Back Drawing====
Back to back drawing is a team building activity where two members of a team sit back to back. One member is given a picture while the other is given a blank piece of paper. The member with the picture has to describe to the other member what the picture includes and the other member has to sketch what is described. At the end of the game, both members compare the picture and the drawing to see how similar they are. This game aims to improve verbal communication between team members.

====The Human Knot====
The human knot is a team building activity where team members stand in a circle and grab hold of the hands of other participants that are not immediately next to them. The objective is to unravel the circle of entangled hands. This game, through the physical touch between team members, will allow them to feel more comfortable with each other. Furthermore, this game can improve the verbal and physical communication between team members and enable the team to identify which communication process is the most effective within the team.&lt;ref&gt;University of Oregon. Human Knot. [Online]. [Accessed 15 October 2014]. Available from:http://leadership.uoregon.edu/resources/exercises_tips/team_builders/human_knot&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership styles in team management==

===Autocratic===
Autocratic leaders make their own decisions without consulting employees or other team members. They hold absolute authority over the team and team members are expected to obey and comply with the decision that is made by the leader. Autocratic leaders use one way communication, which is that they will instruct team members without expecting feedback in return. The benefit of this leadership style is that decisions can be made quickly, especially if the team is in crisis, considering the views of all team members will be time consuming and impractical. However, this can lead to over dependency on the team leader as all decisions are made by him or her and it can also lead to a low team morale as the input of team members are not valued.&lt;ref&gt;Business Case Studies. People Theory. [Online]. [Accessed 15 October 2014]. Available from:http://businesscasestudies.co.uk/business-theory/people/methods-of-management.html#axzz3G3IJTqND&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Textbook"&gt;Simpson, P.; Smith, A. 2011. Business and Management for the IB Diploma. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic===
Democratic leaders will consult with employees before proceeding to make a decision. Democratic leaders will take on a two way communication approach where team members can provide input and voice out their opinions aside from the team leader issuing instructions. Team leaders who take on this leadership style will require excellent communication skills to express to the team members what is expected of them and to respond to and understand their concerns. The benefit of this leadership style is that team members will feel more valued, leading to an overall increase in productivity in the team. However, a drawback is that since employees have a greater involvement in decision making it might slow down the decision making process.&lt;ref name="Textbook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riley, J. 2012. Leadership - Models and Styles. [Online]. [Accessed 15 October 2014]. Available from: http://www.tutor2u.net/business/strategy/leadership-models-styles.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laissez-Faire===
Laissez faire is a leadership style where the team leader will allow the team members to carry out their duties on their own and at their own pace. There is little to no management and authority implemented by the team leader. This style of leadership is applicable to product design or advertising teams where flexibility and freedom provides a more suitable environment to stimulate creativity and is expected to generate positive results. The benefit of this leadership style is that team members who do not like to be controlled and closely monitored can prosper and fulfil their potential as this is the environment in which they function best. The limitation of laissez faire is that team members might make poor judgements due to a lack of supervision and they might not work as hard because of the absence of a superior.&lt;ref name="Textbook"/&gt;

'''''The Five Dysfunctions of a Team''''' is a business book by consultant and speaker [[Patrick Lencioni]] first published in 2002. It describes the many pitfalls that teams face as they seek to "grow together".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Book Summary: The Five Dysfunctions of a Team|url = https://www.talentsquare.com/blog/book-summary-the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/|website = www.talentsquare.com|access-date = 2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book explores the fundamental causes of [[Workplace politics|organizational politics]] and team failure. Like most of Lencioni's books, the bulk of it is written as a [[business fable]]. This book has appeared on American best-seller lists including: ''[[The New York Times Best Seller List]]'', ''[[Business Week]]'', ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.businessweek.com/@@2rq5NIYQUxYloBEA/magazine/content/04_06/b3869036_mz005.htm |title=The BusinessWeek Best-Seller List |date=January 30, 2004 |publisher=[[BusinessWeek]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808050217/http://www.businessweek.com/@@2rq5NIYQUxYloBEA/magazine/content/04_06/b3869036_mz005.htm |archivedate=August 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issues it describes were considered especially important to team sports. The book's lessons were applied by several coaches to their teams in the [[National Football League]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.usatoday.com/educate/college/careers/Hot/11-28-05.htm|publisher=USA Today|author=Del Jones|date=November 28, 2005|title=Business leadership book wins fans in NFL – Several coaches apply 'Five Dysfunctions' to game play}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
According to the book, the five dysfunctions are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Patrick Lencioni|title=The Five Dysfunctions of a Team|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AEIGAAAACAAJ|isbn=0-7879-6075-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Absence of trust—unwilling to be ''vulnerable'' within the group
* Fear of conflict—seeking ''artificial harmony'' over constructive passionate debate
* Lack of commitment—feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ''ambiguity'' throughout the organization
* Avoidance of accountability—ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets ''low standards''
* Inattention to results—focusing on personal success, ''status and ego'' before team success

== Criticism ==
Gordon Curphy and [[Robert Hogan (psychologist)|Robert Hogan]], both organizational [[psychologist]]s and leadership researchers, provide a critical perspective on Lencioni's team model in their book The Rocket Model: Practical Advice for Building High Performing Teams.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Model-Practical-Building-Performing/dp/0984096981|title=The Rocket Model: Practical Advice for Building High Performing Teams|last=Curphy|first=Gordon|last2=Hogan|first2=Robert|publisher=Hogan Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0984096985|location=USA|pages=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they clearly emphasize The Five Dysfunctions of a Team's contributions to the field they also point out major drawbacks of the model:

"Lencioni's model provides useful insights about team dynamics and has some advantages over the other models. The model is straightforward, identifies many of the reasons why teams fail, and offers practical advice on how to build high-functioning teams. Lencioni also deserves credit for pointing out the following: (1) the importance of the "first team"; (2) the need for leaders to teach teams how to win; (3) the recognition of time wasted avoiding conflict; and (4) cascading effect of leadership team dynamics. The simplicity of the Five Dysfunctions model, key insights, and 'touchy-feely' approach to team building make it popular among human resource professionals and team consultants. Nonetheless, Lencioni's book is explicitly a work of fiction; it is not based on research and its practical recommendations lack empirical support. For example, when the trust level among team members is low, Lencioni recommends that leaders put them through a series of personal disclosures and outdoor experiential exercises. However, there is little likelihood that these activities can build trust in dysfunctional work teams. It is more likely that leaders of low-trust teams will invite the members to a paint ball outing but be the only persons with guns. According to Katzenbach and Smith, the only effective method for teams to build trust and cohesion is to do real work,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wisdom of Teams|last=Katzenbach|first=Jon|publisher=HarperBusiness|year=1994|isbn=|location=USA, Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Meyrs-Briggs Type Indicator Step II (Form Q) Profile|last=Myers|first=K.|last2=Myers|first2=P.|publisher=Consulting Psychologists Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=USA, California, Palo Alto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the results do not constitute real work. Similar problems afflict the four other dysfunctions."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He was born in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] as a son of medical doctor [[Edvard Isak Hambro Bull]] (1845&amp;ndash;1925).&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Theodor Bull|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Theodor_Bull|language=Norwegian|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a brother of theatre director [[Johan Peter Bull]], historian and politician [[Edvard Bull, Sr.|Edvard Bull]] and literary professor [[Francis Bull]].

==Overview==
In simplified terms, the theory of the firm aims to answer these questions:
# Existence. Why do firms emerge? Why are not all transactions in the economy mediated over the market?
# Boundaries. Why is the boundary between firms and the market located exactly there with relation to size and output variety? Which transactions are performed internally and which are negotiated on the market?
# Organization.  Why are firms structured in such a specific way, for example as to hierarchy or decentralization? What is the interplay of formal and informal relationships?
# Heterogeneity of firm actions/performances. What drives different actions and performances of firms?
# Evidence. What tests are there for respective theories of the firm?&lt;ref&gt;Thomas N. Hubbard (2008).

Firms exist as an alternative system to the market-price mechanism when it is more efficient to produce in a non-market environment. For example, in a [[labour economics|labor]] [[Market (economics)|market]], it might be very difficult or costly for [[Business|firms]] or organizations to engage in [[Outline of industrial organization|production]] when they have to hire and fire their workers depending on demand/supply conditions. It might also be costly for [[employees]] to shift companies every day looking for better alternatives. Similarly, it may be costly for companies to find new suppliers daily. Thus, firms engage in a long-term contract with their employees or a long-term contract with suppliers to minimize the [[cost]] or maximize the value of [[property rights (economics)|property rights]].&lt;ref name="Coase"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coase |first=Ronald H. |authorlink= |year=1937 |title=[[The Nature of the Firm]]|journal=Economica |volume=4 |issue=16 |pages=[http://www.sonoma.edu/users/e/eyler/426/coase1.pdf 386–405]|url=|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bengt R.

==Background==
The First World War period saw  change of emphasis in economic theory away from industry-level analysis which mainly included analyzing [[Market (economics)|market]]s to analysis at the level of the firm, as it became increasingly clear that [[perfect competition]] was no longer an adequate model of how firms behaved. Economic theory until then had focused on trying to understand markets alone and there had been little study on understanding why firms or organisations exist. [[Market (economics)|Market]]s are guided by prices and quality as illustrated by vegetable markets where a buyer is free to switch sellers in an exchange.

The need for a revised theory of the firm was emphasized by [[empirical]] studies by [[Adolf Berle]] and [[Gardiner Means]], who made it clear that ownership of a typical [[United States|American]] corporation is spread over a wide number of [[shareholder]]s, leaving control in the hands of managers who own very little [[equity (finance)|equity]] themselves.&lt;ref name="Berle and Means"&gt;

==Transaction cost theory==

{{main|Transaction cost}}

[[Image:Market-Hierarchy-Model.png|500px|right|thumb|The model shows institutions and market as a possible form of organization to coordinate economic transactions. When the external transaction costs are higher than the internal transaction costs, the company will grow. If the external transaction costs are lower than the internal transaction costs the company will be downsized by outsourcing, for example.]]

According to [[Ronald Coase]], people begin to organise their production in firms when the [[transaction cost]] of coordinating production through the market  exchange, given imperfect information, is greater than within the firm.&lt;ref name="Coase"/&gt;

[[Ronald Coase]] set out his [[transaction cost]] theory of the firm in 1937, making it one of the first ([[neoclassical economics|neo-classical]]) attempts to define the firm theoretically in relation to the market.&lt;ref name="Coase"/&gt; One aspect of its 'neoclassicism' lies in presenting an explanation of the firm consistent with [[constant returns to scale]], rather than relying on [[increasing returns to scale]].&lt;ref name="Archibald"&gt;Archibald, G.C. (1987 [2008]). "firm, theory of the," ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 2, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another is in defining a firm in a manner which is both realistic and compatible with the idea of substitution at the margin, so instruments of conventional economic analysis apply. He notes that a firm’s interactions with the market may not be under its control (for instance because of sales taxes), but its internal allocation of resources are: “Within a firm, … market transactions are eliminated and in place of the complicated market structure with exchange transactions is substituted the [[entrepreneur]] … who directs production.”  He asks why alternative methods of production (such as the [[Bid-offer spread|price mechanism]] and [[economic interventionism|economic planning]]), could not either achieve all production, so that either firms use internal prices for all their production, or one big firm runs the entire economy. &lt;!-- see john erdman, 2006 --&gt;

Coase begins from the standpoint that markets could in theory carry out all production, and that what needs to be explained is the existence of the firm, with its "distinguishing mark … [of] the supersession of the price mechanism."  Coase identifies some reasons why firms might arise, and dismisses each as unimportant:

# if some people prefer to work under direction and are prepared to pay for the privilege (but this is unlikely);
# if some people prefer to direct others and are prepared to pay for this (but generally people are paid more to direct others);
# if purchasers prefer goods produced by firms.

Instead, for Coase the main reason to establish a firm is to avoid some of the transaction costs of using the price mechanism. These include discovering relevant prices (which can be reduced but not eliminated by purchasing this information through specialists), as well as the costs of negotiating and writing enforceable contracts for each transaction (which can be large if there is uncertainty). Moreover, contracts in an uncertain world will necessarily be incomplete and have to be frequently re-negotiated. The costs of haggling about division of surplus, particularly if there is [[asymmetric information]] and [[asset specificity]], may be considerable.  &lt;!-- does "surplus" here refer to excess production or to profit? --&gt;

If a firm operated internally under the market system, many contracts would be required (for instance, even for procuring a pen or delivering a presentation).  In contrast, a real firm has very few (though much more complex) contracts, such as defining a manager's power of direction over employees, in exchange for which the employee is paid.  These kinds of contracts are drawn up in situations of uncertainty, in particular for relationships which last long periods of time.  Such a situation runs counter to neo-classical economic theory.  The neo-classical market is instantaneous, forbidding the development of extended agent-principal (employee-manager) relationships, of planning, and of [[trust (social sciences)|trust]].  Coase concludes that “a firm is likely therefore to emerge in those cases where a very short-term contract would be unsatisfactory”, and that “it seems improbable that a firm would emerge without the existence of uncertainty”.

He notes that government measures relating to the market ([[sales tax]]es, [[rationing]], [[price controls]]) tend to increase the size of firms, since firms internally would not be subject to such transaction costs.  Thus, Coase defines the firm as "the system of relationships which comes into existence when the direction of resources is dependent on the entrepreneur."  We can therefore think of a firm as getting larger or smaller based on whether the entrepreneur organises more or fewer transactions.

The question then arises of what determines the size of the firm; why does the entrepreneur organise the transactions he does, why no more or less?  Since the reason for the firm's being is to have lower costs than the market, the upper limit on the firm's size is set by costs rising to the point where internalising an additional transaction equals the cost of making that transaction in the market. (At the lower limit, the firm’s costs exceed the market’s costs, and it does not come into existence.)  In practice, diminishing returns to management contribute most to raising the costs of organising a large firm, particularly in large firms with many different plants and differing internal transactions (such as a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]), or if the relevant prices change frequently.

Coase concludes by saying that the size of the firm is dependent on the costs of using the price mechanism, and on the costs of organisation of other entrepreneurs.  These two factors together determine how many products a firm produces and how much of each.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H. Coase (1988).

==Reconsiderations of transaction cost theory==
According to Louis Putterman, most economists accept distinction between intra-firm and interfirm transaction but also that the two shade into each other; the extent of a firm is not simply defined by its capital stock.&lt;ref name="Putterman"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Economic Nature of the Firm |last=Putterman |first= Louis |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-47092-7 |page= |pages= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Barclay Richardson]] for example, notes that a rigid distinction fails because of the existence of intermediate forms between firm and market such as inter-firm co-operation.&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;

Klein (1983) asserts that “Economists now recognise that such a sharp distinction does not exist and that it is useful to consider also transactions occurring within the firm as representing market (contractual) relationships.” The costs involved in such transactions that are within a firm or even between the firms are the [[transaction cost]]s.

Ultimately, whether the firm constitutes a domain of bureaucratic direction that is shielded from market forces or simply “a legal fiction”, “a nexus for a set of contracting relationships among individuals” (as [[Michael C. Jensen|Jensen]] and [[William H. Meckling|Meckling]] put it) is “a function of the completeness of markets and the ability of market forces to penetrate intra-firm relationships”.&lt;ref name="Jensen and Meckling"&gt;

==Managerial and behavioural theories==
It was only in the 1960s that the neo-classical theory of the firm was seriously challenged by alternatives such as managerial and behavioral theories. Managerial theories of the firm, as developed by [[William Baumol]] (1959 and 1962), [[Robin Marris]] (1964) and [[Oliver E. Williamson]] (1966), suggest that managers would seek to maximise their own [[utility]] and consider the implications of this for firm behavior in contrast to the profit-maximising case. (Baumol suggested that managers’ interests are best served by maximising sales after achieving a minimum level of profit which satisfies shareholders.) More recently this has developed into ‘[[principal–agent problem|principal–agent]]’ analysis (e.g., Spence and Zeckhauser&lt;ref name="Spence and Zeckhauser"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spence |first=Michael A. |authorlink= |author2=Zeckhauser, Richard  |year=1971 |title=Insurance, Information, and Individual Action |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=380–387 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ross (1973){{citation needed|date=April 2009}} on problems of contracting with asymmetric information) which models a widely applicable case where a principal (a shareholder or firm for example) cannot costlessly infer how an agent (a manager or supplier, say) is behaving. This may arise either because the agent has greater expertise or knowledge than the principal, or because the principal cannot directly observe the agent’s actions; it is asymmetric information which leads to a problem of [[moral hazard]]. This means that to an extent managers can pursue their own interests. Traditional managerial models typically assume that managers, instead of maximising profit, maximise a simple objective utility function (this may include salary, [[Employee benefit|perks]], security, power, prestige) subject to an arbitrarily given profit constraint (profit [[satisficing]]).

===Behavioural approach===
{{Main|Behavioural theory of the firm}}
The behavioural approach, as developed in particular by [[Richard Cyert]] and [[James G. March]] of the [[Carnegie School]] places emphasis on explaining how decisions are taken within the firm, and goes well beyond neoclassical economics.&lt;ref name="Cyert and March"&gt;
{{cite book

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of this depended on [[Herbert A. Simon]]’s work in the 1950s concerning behaviour in situations of uncertainty, which argued that “people possess limited cognitive ability and so can exercise only ‘[[bounded rationality]]’ when making decisions in complex, uncertain situations”. Thus individuals and groups tend to "[[satisfice]]"—that is, to attempt to attain realistic goals, rather than maximize a utility or profit function. Cyert and March argued that the firm cannot be regarded as a monolith, because different individuals and groups within it have their own aspirations and conflicting interests, and that firm behaviour is the weighted outcome of these conflicts. Organisational mechanisms (such as "satisficing" and sequential decision-taking) exist to maintain conflict at levels that are not unacceptably detrimental. Compared to ideal state of productive efficiency, there is organisational slack (Leibenstein’s [[X-inefficiency]]).

===Team production===
[[Armen Alchian]] and Harold Demsetz's analysis of [[team production]] extends and clarifies earlier work by Coase.&lt;ref name="Alchian and Demsetz"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last=Alchian | first=Armen A.

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus according to them the firm emerges because extra output is provided by team production, but that the success of this depends on being able to manage the team so that metering problems (it is costly to measure the marginal outputs of the co-operating inputs for reward purposes) and attendant shirking (the moral hazard problem) can be overcome, by estimating [[marginal productivity]] by observing or specifying input behaviour. Such monitoring as is therefore necessary, however, can only be encouraged effectively if the monitor is the recipient of the activity’s residual income (otherwise the monitor herself would have to be monitored, ad infinitum). For Alchian and Demsetz, the firm therefore is an entity which brings together a team which is more productive working together than at arm’s length through the market, because of informational problems associated with monitoring of effort. In effect, therefore, this is a "principal-agent" theory, since it is asymmetric information within the firm which Alchian and Demsetz emphasise must be overcome. In Barzel (1982)’s theory of the firm, drawing on Jensen and Meckling (1976), the firm emerges as a means of centralising monitoring and thereby avoiding costly redundancy in that function (since in a firm the responsibility for monitoring can be centralised in a way that it cannot if production is organised as a group of workers each acting as a firm).{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The weakness in Alchian and Demsetz’s argument, according to Williamson, is that their concept of team production has quite a narrow range of application, as it assumes outputs cannot be related to individual inputs. In practice this may have limited applicability (small work group activities, the largest perhaps a symphony orchestra), since most outputs within a firm (such as manufacturing and secretarial work) are separable, so that individual inputs can be rewarded on the basis of outputs. Hence team production cannot offer the explanation of why firms (in particular, large multi-plant and multi-product firms) exist, etc.

==Asset specificity==
For [[Oliver E. Williamson]], the existence of firms derives from ‘asset specificity’ in production, where assets are specific to each other such that their value is much less in a second-best use.&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;
{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This causes problems if the assets are owned by different firms (such as purchaser and supplier), because it will lead to protracted [[bargaining]] concerning the [[gains from trade]], because both agents are likely to become locked into a position where they are no longer [[competing]] with a (possibly large) number of agents in the entire market, and the incentives are no longer there to represent their positions honestly: large-numbers bargaining is transformed into small-number bargaining.

If the transaction is a recurring or lengthy one, re-negotiation may be necessary as a continual power struggle takes place concerning the gains from trade, further increasing the [[transaction cost]]s. Moreover, there are likely to be situations where a purchaser may require a particular, firm-specific investment of a supplier which would be profitable for both; but after the investment has been made it becomes a sunk cost and the purchaser can attempt to re-negotiate the contract such that the supplier may make a loss on the investment (this is the [[hold-up problem]], which occurs when either party asymmetrically incurs substantial costs or benefits before being paid for or paying for them). In this kind of a situation, the most efficient way to overcome the continual conflict of interest between the two agents (or coalitions of agents) may be the removal of one of them from the equation by [[takeover]] or [[merger]]. Asset specificity can also apply to some extent to both physical and human capital, so that the hold-up problem can also occur with labour (e.g. labour can threaten a strike, because of the lack of good alternative [[human capital]]; but equally the firm can threaten to fire).

Probably the best constraint on such opportunism is [[reputation]] (rather than the [[law]], because of the difficulty of [[negotiating]], writing and enforcement of [[contract]]s).  If a reputation for opportunism significantly damages an agent’s dealings in the future, this alters the [[incentive]]s to be opportunistic.&lt;ref name="Oliar and Sprigman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oliar |first=Dotan |authorlink= |author2=Sprigman, Christopher Jon  |year=2008 |title=There's No Free Laugh (Anymore): The Emergence of Intellectual Property Norms and the Transformation of Stand-Up Comedy |journal=Virginal Law Review |volume=94 |issue=8 |pages=1787–1867 |url=http://www.virginialawreview.org/content/pdfs/94/1787.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williamson sees the limit on the size of the firm as being given partly by costs of [[delegation]] (as a firm’s size increase its hierarchical [[bureaucracy]] does too), and the large firm’s increasing inability to replicate the high-powered incentives of the residual income of an owner-entrepreneur. This is partly because it is in the nature of a large firm that its existence is more secure and less dependent on the actions of any one individual (increasing the incentives to shirk), and because intervention rights from the centre characteristic of a firm tend to be accompanied by some form of income insurance to compensate for the lesser responsibility, thereby diluting incentives. Milgrom and Roberts (1990) explain the increased cost of management as due to the incentives of employees to provide false information beneficial to themselves, resulting in costs to managers of filtering information, and often the making of decisions without full information.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} This grows worse with firm size and more layers in the hierarchy. Empirical analyses of transaction costs have attempted to measure and operationalize transaction costs.&lt;ref&gt;Barak D. Richman and Jeffrey Mache (2008).

Edited by [[Arne Nygaard]] and [[Robert Dahlstrom]].&lt;/ref&gt; Research that attempts to measure transaction costs is the most critical limit to efforts to potential falsification and validation of transaction cost economics.

==Firm economies==
The theory of the firm considers what bounds the size and output variety of firms. This includes how firms may be able to combine labour and capital so as to lower the [[average cost]] of output, either from increasing, decreasing, or constant [[returns to scale]] for one product line or from  [[economies of scope]] for more than one product line.&lt;ref name="Archibald"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John C. Panzar and Robert D. Willig (1981). "Economies of Scope," ''American Economic Review'', 71(2), p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1815729 p. 268]–272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Tirole]] (1988). ''The Theory of Industrial Organization''. "The Theory of the Firm," pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HIjsF0XONF8C&amp;pg=PA18 18–20.] MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other models==
[[Efficiency wages|Efficiency wage]] models like that of Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) suggest wage rents as an addition to monitoring, since this gives employees an incentive not to shirk, given a certain probability of detection and the consequence of being fired.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} Williamson, Wachter and Harris (1975) suggest promotion incentives within the firm as an alternative to morale-damaging monitoring, where promotion is based on objectively measurable performance.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} (The difference between these two approaches may be that the former is applicable to a [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] environment, the latter to a [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] one). Leibenstein (1966) sees a firm’s norms or conventions, dependent on its history of management initiatives, labour relations and other factors, as determining the firm’s "culture" of effort, thus affecting the firm’s productivity and hence size.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

[[George Akerlof]] (1982) develops a gift exchange model of [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], in which employers offer wages unrelated to variations in output and above the market level, and workers have developed a concern for each other’s welfare, such that all put in effort above the minimum required, but the more able workers are not rewarded for their extra productivity; again, size here depends not on rationality or efficiency but on social factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hans|first1=V. Basil|title=Roles and Responsibilities of Managerial Economists: Empowering Business through Methodology and Strategy|journal=10|date=December 2016|volume=2|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, the limit to the firm’s size is given where costs rise to the point where the market can undertake some transactions more efficiently than the firm.

Recently, [[Yochai Benkler]] further questioned the rigid distinction between firms and markets based on the increasing salience of “[[commons-based peer production]]” systems such as [[open source software]] (e.g., [[Linux]]), [[Wikipedia]], [[Creative Commons]], etc.  He put forth this argument in ''[[The Wealth of Networks|The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom]]'', which was released in 2006 under a Creative Commons [[share-alike]] license.&lt;ref name="Benkler"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets |last=Benkler |first=Yochai |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.benkler.org/wealth_of_networks/index.php/Main_Page |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grossman-Hart-Moore theory ==
In modern [[contract theory]], the “theory of the firm” is often identified with the “property rights approach” that was developed by [[Sanford J. Grossman]], [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver D. Hart]], and [[John Hardman Moore|John H. Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contract theory|last = Bolton|first = Patrick|publisher = MIT Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Dewatripont|first2 = Matthias}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Thinking about the Firm: A Review of Daniel Spulber's The Theory of the Firm|url = http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/abs/10.1257/jel.49.1.101|journal = Journal of Economic Literature|date = 2011|issn = 0022-0515|pages = 101-113|volume = 49|issue = 1|doi = 10.1257/jel.49.1.101|first = Oliver|last = Hart}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property rights approach to the theory of the firm is also known as the “Grossman-Hart-Moore theory”. In their seminal work, Grossman and Hart (1986), Hart and Moore (1990) and Hart (1995) developed the [[Incomplete contracts|incomplete contracting]] paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Costs and Benefits of Ownership: A Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261404|journal = Journal of Political Economy|date = 1986|issn = 0022-3808|pages = 691-719|volume = 94|issue = 4|doi = 10.1086/261404|first = Sanford J.|last = Grossman|first2 = Oliver D.|last2 = Hart}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Property Rights and the Nature of the Firm|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261729|journal = Journal of Political Economy|date = 1990|issn = 0022-3808|pages = 1119-1158|volume = 98|issue = 6|doi = 10.1086/261729|first = Oliver|last = Hart|first2 = John|last2 = Moore|citeseerx = 10.1.1.472.9089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Firms, contracts, and financial structure.|last = Hart|first = Oliver|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that if contracts cannot specify what is to be done given every possible contingency, then property rights (and hence firm boundaries) matter. Specifically, consider a seller of an intermediate good and a buyer. Should the seller own the physical assets that are necessary to produce the good (non-integration) or should the buyer be the owner (integration)? After relationship-specific investments have been made, the seller and the buyer bargain. When they are symmetrically informed, they will always agree to collaborate. Yet, the division of the ex post surplus depends on the parties’ disagreement payoffs (the payoffs they would get if no ex post agreement were reached), which in turn depend on the ownership structure. Thus, the ownership structure has an influence on the incentives to invest. A central insight of the theory is that the party with the more important investment decision should be the owner. Another prominent conclusion is that joint asset ownership is suboptimal if investments are in human capital. 

The Grossman-Hart-Moore model has been successfully applied in many contexts, e.g. with regard to [[privatization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Proper Scope of Government: Theory and an Application to Prisons|url = http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/112/4/1127|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date = 1997|issn = 0033-5533|pages = 1127-1161|volume = 112|issue = 4|doi = 10.1162/003355300555448|language = en|first = Oliver|last = Hart|first2 = Andrei|last2 = Shleifer|first3 = Robert W.|last3 = Vishny}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiu (1998) and DeMeza and Lockwood (1998) have extended the model by considering different bargaining games that the parties may play ex post (which can explain ownership by the less important investor).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Noncooperative Bargaining, Hostages, and Optimal Asset Ownership|last = Chiu|first = Y.
