      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="949">Agnesium is a [[neologism]] coined to describe a powerful, efficient and effective organization as an entity.&lt;ref&gt;Introducing Organizational Behaviour and Management
 By David Knights, Hugh Willmott&lt;/ref&gt; Agnesium is a combination of [https://translate.google.ch/?oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;client=tw-ob#la/en/Agnes Agnes] (Latin for powerful, efficient and effective) and the suffix -ium &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/-ium -ium]&lt;/ref&gt; (indicating a biological structure).

The basic principle of Agnesium is that for complex structures/organizations there are many interdependencies between the members that are not known, understood or leveraged. By recognizing, understanding and leveraging these hidden interdependencies an organization can be proactive, adaptive and exploitive.

'''Agriplace''' is an [[industrial park]] located in the [[North Industrial SDA, Saskatoon|North Industrial SDA]] Suburban Development Area of [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]. Industrial parks are usually located close to [[transport]] facilities, especially where [[intermodal freight transport|more than one transport modalities]] coincide.   [[Saskatchewan Highway 16|Sk Hwy 16, the Yellowhead]], [[Saskatchewan Highway 11|Sk Hwy 11]], and Sk Hwy 11 are all accessed directly from Agriplace. The [[Saskatoon John G. Diefenbaker International Airport]] is southwest of the Sk Hwy 16, the Yellowhead highway.

==Geography==
The land was annexed from the [[rural municipality]] of [[Corman Park No. 344, Saskatchewan|Corman Park]] between 1980 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agriplace subdivision is nestled between three major trucking routes. Sk Hwy 16, the Yellowhead departs Saskatoon to North Battleford to the north west. Sk Hwy 11 to [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] via [[Warman, Saskatchewan|Warman]], and  [[Saskatchewan Highway 12|Sk Hwy 12]] to [[Blaine Lake]] via [[Martensville, Saskatchewan|Martensville]] mark the eastern boundary. 71st Street is the northern perimeter of the industrial park.

==History==
First laid out in the early 1980s, Agriplace became well known to Saskatonians through the decision to replace the original downtown [[Saskatoon Arena]] with a new indoor arena facility. Three major locations were considered: on the site of a decommissioned power plant just west of the original Arena location (lands now part of [[River Landing]]), a site in the [[North Industrial, Saskatoon|North Industrial]] district east of Idylwyld Drive, and a site in the south portion of the yet-to-be-developed Agriplace. Ultimately, Agriplace was chosen for the location of Saskatchewan Place (later renamed [[Credit Union Centre]]), an initially controversial decision due to Agriplace's remote location relative to the rest of the city and the fact accessing the area requires driving on freeways (it was not until the extension of Marquis Drive in the early 2010s that motorists from Saskatoon were given a non-freeway/non-service road option for accessing the area).

At one point the City of Saskatoon also pursued plans to relocate the city's exhibition grounds onto lands adjacent to the new arena and north of 60th Street West, but public opposition and lack of space led to this plan being dropped by the late 1980s.

Agriplace also received some additional notoriety when it first appeared on City maps. One of the area's major streets carries the name "Thatcher Avenue"; it appeared on maps the same year former MLA [[Colin Thatcher]] was on trial for murder, a sensational case that attracted international attention. In this case, however, the street wasn't named for Thatcher nor his father, former Saskatchewan Premier [[Ross Thatcher]], but rather for a species of wheat, in keeping with the general naming conventions in the area.

In 2003, Saunders Avenue, one of the access roads into Credit Union Centre, was renamed [[Bill Hunter (ice hockey)|Bill Hunter]] Avenue in honor of the hockey manager and promoter who attempted to get the [[St. Louis Blues]] [[National Hockey League]] team transferred to Saskatoon in the 1980s. The renaming was noted with irony as Hunter opposed the Agriplace location of the arena.

==Economy==
The agriplace industrial park is a mix of commercial and industrial concerns. [[Costco]], a members only bulk grocery and department store, is a major employer in the agriplace district.  [[Sasktel Centre]] formerly named Credit Union Centre, and Saskatchewan Place is a 12000-seat arena hosting sporting, concert and large events to Saskatoon. Canlan Ice Sports Agriplace Centre is located on Apex Street. The Husky truck stop has relocated from Circle Drive to Agriplace. Motel 6 an Tim Hortons have opened near the Husky.

In the Agriplace subdivision are located 48 sectors giving employment to 780 full-time employees and 221 part-time employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Ahmedabad Textile Industry's Research Association''' (commonly known as '''ATIRA''') is an [[autonomous]] [[non-profit]] association for [[Textile engineering|textile research]] located in the [[Navarangpura]] area of [[Ahmedabad]], [[India]]. It is the largest association for textile research &amp; allied industries in India. Established on 13 December 1947, and started in 1949, ATIRA was recognized by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research under the Ministry of Science and Technology, [[Government of India]]. It was later linked to the Ministry of Textiles.

==Establishment==
[[File:Ahmedabad Textile Industry's Research Association building (15 05 2006).jpg|thumb|300px|The main ATIRA building]]
The idea of ATIRA was conceived by [[Vikram Sarabhai]], [[Kasturbhai Lalbhai]] and [[Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar]]. The foundation stone for the ATIRA complex was laid by [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 1 November 1950 which was inaugurated by the then [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru]] on completion on 10 April 1954. The [[architect]] of the ATIRA building is Achyut Kanvinde. Dr. Vikram Sarabhai served as its first honorary director.

==Membership and funding==
Membership in ATIRA is voluntary. ATIRA has 146 member units in both India and abroad. Of these 93 are [[Ginning]], [[Spinning (textiles)|Spinning]], [[Weaving]], Process Houses and Composite Textile Units and 53 are manufacturers of fibres, dyes, chemicals, instruments, equipment and machinery.

ATIRA is financed by four sources – Annual Subscription from member units, income from the services it has rendered, sponsored research from the Industry, Ministry of Textiles, Ministry of Information Technology and other agencies like the [[Gujarat State, India#Government and politics|Gujarat State Government]]. [[Grant (money)|Grant aid]] is also provided by the Government of India.

==Administration==
ATIRA's governing council consists of 17 members. It consists of 5 elected members from the industry, including the Chairman, 3 nominated members from various departments of Government of India and 3 scientists as designated members. In addition to these a representative from the associate members and the president of the Ahmedabad Textile Mills Association are also the members of the council. The 4 Directors of Cotton Textile Research Associations are [[ex-officio]] members including the Director of ATIRA.

At present the association has a total membership of 91 units spread all over India. This consists of 10 original or privileged members units and 81 Associate Members units.

Currently the Deputy Director of ATIRA, C. R. Prayag, is officiating as Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atira.in/ContactUs.aspx|title=ATIRA|website=atira.in|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
ATIRA is situated close to many prominent research and educational institutions like [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]], [[Physical Research Laboratory]] and [[Gujarat University]]. It has a 2,72,000-square-metre campus which has a plant coverage of over 1,000 trees. This has made it a popular spot for morning walks and jogging among local residents.

'''Aztec West''' is a [[business park]] in [[South Gloucestershire]], [[England]], situated in the north of [[Bristol]], near [[Bradley Stoke]] and [[Patchway]]. It is close to the [[M4 motorway|M4]] and [[M5 motorway|M5]] motorways and the [[Almondsbury Interchange]]. Adjacent is the [[A38 road|A38]] trunk road.

==History==
The park has been developed since the early 1980s, but some land is still available for future development. 

The name is said to derive from 'A to Z of Technology'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brooke|first1=Gerry|title=Week That Was&amp;nbsp;— January 1980|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Cornwell-jailed-drugs-charge/story-11235740-detail/story.html|accessdate=12 March 2015|work=Bristol Post|date=5 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was conceived as a science park&amp;nbsp;— it was originally funded by the 'Electricity Supply Nominees' on the half of the Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) pension fund but in the mid-1980s was sold to Arlington Securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=200 Aztec West|url=http://www.czwg.com/images/uploads/CZWG_Aztec_West.pdf|publisher=CZWG|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The buildings are in the [[High-tech architecture|high tech]] and [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]] styles and were designed by practices including [[Nicholas Grimshaw]], Michael Aukett, SOM and CZWG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verey|first1=David|last2=Brooks|first2=Alan|title=Buildings of England: Gloucestershire, Volume 2|date=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300097337|pages=162-164|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=m9W2XH11-9EC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=Aztec+West+Nicholas+Grimshaw&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zW7y3SZase&amp;sig=1mK6TnpsqJDoAolLepb8OxDCf3s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBWoVChMI7afF9PCPyQIVBrcUCh3srQJY#v=onepage&amp;q=Aztec%20West%20Nicholas%20Grimshaw&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Companies==
[[File:Aztec Centre.jpg|left|thumb|The Aztec Centre at Aztec West]]

Aztec West is home to over 100 companies, and 7,000 people work there.
The Aztec Centre was opened by [[Margaret Thatcher]] on Friday 15 December 1989 and there is a plaque to commemorate this in its entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aztec West Business Park|url=http://www.patchwayjournal.co.uk/aztec-west-business-park/|publisher=Patchway Journal|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The park includes warehouse/factory units, the four star Aztec Hotel, several office villages, a central retail area and a [[Starbucks]] connected to a bar in a hotel, the first such facility in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/2008/03/13/319616/starbucks-signs-first-hotel-licensing-deal.html|title=Starbucks signs first hotel licensing deal|publisher=Caterersearch.com|accessdate=8 July 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080720094630/http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/2008/03/13/319616/starbucks-signs-first-hotel-licensing-deal.html| archivedate= 20 July 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included in the landscaping are three lakes. Nearby are the aerospace industries at [[Filton]] and the large business parks at the edge of Bradley Stoke.

Companies include [[Nokia]], [[General Electric]], [[Liverpool Victoria]], [[HSS Hire]], [[EE (telecommunications company)|EE]], [[Aardman Animations|Aardman]], [[Imagination Technologies]], [[Broadcom]], [[Allianz]], [[Hoare Lea]], [[Atkins (company)|Atkins]], [[Co-op Legal Services|The Co-operative Legal Services]], [[CGI Group|CGI]], [[Babcock International|Babcock]], [[HSBC]], [[Handelsbanken]], [[IWG plc|Regus]], [[Zuken]], [[Vaillant Group|Vaillant]], [[Virgin Media]], [[Taylor Wimpey]], [[SCC (Specialist Computer Centres)|SCC]] and [[Highways England]].

==Transport==
Aztec West is less than half a mile from the [[M5 motorway|M5]] Junction 16, and a mile from the [[Almondsbury Interchange]] with the [[M4 motorway|M4]]. It is also in close proximity to the new housing project in Cribbs Causeway.

Public transport links are quite limited, although a number of bus services from the Bristol area do run on to Aztec West. The main services are the '3' series of routes operated by [[Wessex Bus|Wessex]] (3A, 3B, 3C, 3X), which run around the business park loop road (Park Avenue), providing direct connections at peak times between the business park and Bristol City Centre (3A / 3C / 3X), [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]] (3B), [[Redland, Bristol|Redland]] (3C / 3X) and [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton Village]] (3C). The routes to/from Bristol City Centre use either the A38 Gloucester Road or Filton Avenue corridors. 
Service 73, operated by [[First West of England]], passes close by but does not enter the business park, providing frequent connections throughout the day from the A38 directly outside to [[Patchway]], Cribbs Causeway Bus Station and [[Bradley Stoke]], [[Bristol Parkway railway station]], [[MoD Abbey Wood]], Gloucester Road and Bristol City Centre. The 73 takes a more indirect route than other services to Bristol City Centre, however it runs much more frequently. Service X73 runs as an express route after [[Bristol Parkway railway station]] on the M32 to Bristol City Centre, although the timetable for this service is designed primarily for commuters travelling to Bristol City Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New bus service links Aztec West with Bristol Parkway Station |url=http://www.bradleystokejournal.co.uk/2014/01/13/bus-service-links-aztec-west-bristol-parkway-station/|publisher=Bradley Stoke Journal|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other routes serving the business park entrance include: 78 /79 north to Thornbury and south to Bristol Bus Station (operated by First); 77 north to Thornbury and south to Bristol Parkway / UWE (operated by Severnside Transport); 483 to Yate and Chipping Sodbury (operated by Wessex).

The X18 (operated by [[First West of England]])  also ran around the business park loop and provided direct connections between Aztec West and [[MoD Abbey Wood]], [[University of the West of England|UWE]], [[Emersons Green]] and [[Kingswood, South Gloucestershire|Kingswood]], following a route along the [[A4174 road|A4174 Avon Ring Road]] until the route was changed in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bristol bus operator First announce a raft of changes to bus services in city |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/bus-operator-announces-timetable-changes-effect/story-26909611-detail/story.html/|publisher=Bristol Post|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commuter coach services, operated by [[The Kings Ferry]], provide a number of peak period journeys to the business park from the North Somerset towns of [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], [[Clevedon]] and [[Weston Super Mare|Weston-super-Mare]]. [[Stagecoach West]] also provides a peak-time commuter coach service, using the name "[[Belles Express]]", between [[Gloucester]] (City Centre &amp; [[Quedgeley]]) and Aztec West.

The business park has no direct rail links. The nearest railway station is at [[Patchway railway station|Patchway]] about a mile and a half away. The mainline station, [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]], is about three miles away. A direct bus service (3B), operated by [[Wessex Bus|Wessex]], connects [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]] to Aztec West throughout the day. This bus service runs around the loop road (Park Avenue).

In 2001 Aztec West was selected as the northern terminus for the proposed [[Bristol Supertram]] project, which was planned to operate as a 30-minute service between the park and Bristol City Centre. The project was cancelled in 2004.

The planned [[MetroBus (Bristol)|MetroBus scheme]] is to serve Aztec West as part of the "North Fringe to Hengrove" route. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MetroBus: Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/streets-travel/metrobus-bus-rapid-transit-brt |publisher=Bristol City Council|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bristol Airport]], south of Bristol, can be reached in about 40–45 minutes by car or bus.

'''Sir Brian Ernest Bell''' [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Papua New Guinea#Order of the Star of Melanesia|CSM]], [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[CStJ]] (3 July 1928{{spaced ndash}}26 July 2010) was an [[Australia]]n-born businessman who established a business empire in [[Papua New Guinea]].

==Early life==
Bell studied pharmacy at the [[Brisbane Central Technical College]], now the [[Queensland University of Technology]]. He moved to [[Port Moresby]], [[Papua New Guinea]] in 1954 as a pharmaceutical chemist in the Bulk Medical Store and soon after established PNG’s first electrical retail outlet.

==Business career==
Bell's business expanded rapidly and Brian Bell and Company was established in 1961. It included department stores, home centres, chemicals, cleaning products and industrial equipment. The Brian Bell Group of Companies is the largest business of its kind in PNG, generating revenue of 253 million [[Papua New Guinean kina|kina]] annually and employing 1300 staff.

==Philanthropy and honours==
Bell supported the [[Port Moresby General Hospital]] (where he was Chairman of the Board), the Red Cross and the Port Moresby City Mission. He also served as deputy lord mayor of Port Moresby, a member of the PNG lands board, the Salvation Army advisory board and the PNG law and order committee. He was at one time chairman of UPNG Foundation, the NCD South Pacific Festival of Arts and the Salvation Army Red Shield Appeal. Bell also served as patron of AIESEC PNG University. He set up a school outside Port Moresby, helped in offering scholarships and funded many needy and deserving young Papua New Guineans.

Bell was Honorary Consul General in Papua New Guinea for Norway and Sweden and was appointed a Knight of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of Merit]] and a Commander of the [[Order of the Polar Star]] (Sweden) for his service in those positions. He also received the PNG Community Service Medal, Queen’s Jubilee Medal, PNG Independence Medals and the Salvation Army’s Order of Distinguished Auxiliary Service. 

Bell was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) for his contributions to business and charity in Papua New Guinea's 1993 New Year's Day Honours List.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=53531 |date=1993-12-30 |page=45 |supp=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a Commander (Brother) of the Order of St John in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=57391 |date=1994-08-24 |page=10694 |supp=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Business''''' ({{lang-ru|Би́знес}}; {{lang-uk|Бізне с}}) is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Russian language|Russian-language]] weekly business newspaper published every Monday. Web-Site https://business-journal.com.ua

==1992–1994==
The newspaper was first published in [[Kiev]] in November 1992. The idea was put forward by Sergey Melnichuk. The motto of the publication was "Read! Think! Do!" The first two years of ''Business'' was a collection of leaflets about buying and selling. Sergei Melnichuk directly supervised the release.

==1994–1998==
In 1994 he decided to broaden the focus to provide economic news and analysis material. That same year Konstantin Donin became editor in chief. Melnichuk tried to expand to three regions, issuing three regional newspapers: ''Business-Donbass'', ''Business-Kharkov'' and ''Business-Crimea''. All publications were issued in Russian. 

During 1994–1995, the newspaper developed rapidly working with advertisers. 

In 1996 the newspaper added a colored cover and raised ad rates. Profitability reached 300% and monthly advertising revenues reached $1.5 million.

In 1996–1997 a group of journalists left ''Business'' to work in the newspaper ''Business Week'', but the financial crisis in 1998 buried the rival. 

==1998–2002==
In February 1998 the producing editor of ''Business'' was intended to be Kramaranko Alexander, who also headed the department "of the Company and the markets." The 1998 financial crisis hit Ukrainian business media, but was overcome in 2000.

Today, weekly circulation is over 60,000 copies, including 44,000 delivered subscriptions.

In April 2002 the chief editor left for ''Kostyanstyn Donin'', a newspaper headed by Igor Vlasjuk.

==2003–present==
In 2003, ''Business'' began to change the concept design and started color printing.

'''''Chopourian v. Catholic Healthcare West''''', Case No. 2:09-CV-02972-KJM-KJN (E.D. Cal. Feb. 28, 2012), was a court case in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California which, at the time, was believed to be the largest single-plaintiff employment verdict in United States history at $167,720,488.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/US/LegalCenter/168-million-awarded-woman-harassed-raunchy-cardiac-surgery/story?id=15835342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.workplacebullying.org/168mil/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAkDb_MKds4&lt;/ref&gt; The record has since been surpassed by the verdict in [[Juarez v.

==Background and Trial==
Ani Chopourian was employed as a Physician Assistant by [[Dignity Health|Catholic Healthcare West]] (now [[Dignity Health]]), Mercy General Hospital in the Cardio Vascular Operating Rooms (“CVOR”) from August 2006 to August 2008. A graduate of Yale University School of Medicine Physician Associates Program in 1999, Ms. Chopourian had been nationally certified by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants since initially obtaining her license in 1999. As a Physician Assistant in the CVOR, Ms. Chopourian’s job responsibilities included the treatment and care for patients undergoing a variety of open heart surgeries including, but not limited to: Coronary Artery Bypass, Aortic/Mitral Valve Replacement, and Congenital Heart Defect Repair. In furtherance of this work, Ms. Chopourian supported heart surgery procedures by providing a number of important functions, including vein/artery harvesting, retraction of the sternum, and other technical functions to assist the heart surgeon. During her employment, Ms. Chopourian worked with numerous different heart surgeons in four different operating rooms in two separate facilities. 

Within months of her employment, in or around October 2006, Ms. Chopourian spoke to her supervisor, Jean Scrafton, about the fact that she was not getting her meal breaks. Ms. Chopourian explained that, as a result of not being able to eat within the first five hours of her shift, she would feel lightheaded and was concerned her performance was being affected. Ms. Chopourian also made a written complaint about this fact in an “Event Report.” In addition to her complaints about lunch breaks, Ms. Chopourian submitted at least 18 written complaints to hospital managers concerning the working conditions in the hospital, including failure to provide required meal breaks, unsafe surgical conditions, bullying, mismanaged care during surgery, verbal abuse by one of the heart surgeons, mistreatment by a coworker, as well as other issues. Ms. Chopourian’s final complaint was submitted July 31, 2008 (8 days before her termination) and was stamped received by human resources.
 
According to the schedule for August 2008 given to Plaintiff regarding on-call assignments, there was no indication Ms. Chopourian would be required to provide post-surgical rounds on Sunday, August 3, 2008. On Saturday night, August 2, 2008, according to procedure, Ms. Chopourian called the PM assignment recording to see if she was needed, as she was on call. There was nothing on the outgoing message indicating she was needed on August 3, 2008. On Sunday, August 3, 2008, Ms. Chopourian received a call from the hospital asking why she was not present to provide post-surgical floor coverage. Ms. Chopourian explained that she was not aware floor coverage was required. Ms. Chopourian offered to come in to provide coverage, but was told not to do so, that coverage was already obtained and her presence was no longer required. On August 7, 2008, Catholic Healthcare West terminated Ms. Chopourian for failing to report to work on Sunday, August 3, 2008. 

On August 1, 2009, almost a year after her termination from Catholic Healthcare West, Ms. Chopourian secured a position as a Physician Assistant with Radiological Associates of Sacramento Medical Group, Inc. (“RAS”). A condition of employment was that she would obtain privileging at Mercy General Hospital. Ms. Chopourian was originally informed by Mercy that there would be no problem obtaining privileging. She was then informed that she would need national certification to obtain privileging. Ms. Chopourian studied for and took the exam, then renewed her application. In the interim, Ms. Chopourian’s first deposition for her pending lawsuit against Catholic Healthcare West was taken on March 15, 2010. During the deposition, Defendant’s counsel questioned Ms. Chopourian about documents she recently produced in response to discovery requests and concluded on the record that Ms. Chopourian had violated medical privacy laws. Ms. Chopourian was never investigated for such a violation, assessed civil penalties, or charged with criminal violation. In May 2010, Ms. Chopourian was informed that her credentialing privileges were being held up because of allegations that she violated patient privacy laws. Ms. Chopourian was denied privileges on June 8, 2010 and subsequently lost her job at RAS on June 21, 2010.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.juryverdictalert.com/jury-verdicts/item/employment/chopourian-v-catholic-healthcare-west&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.morelaw.com/verdicts/case.asp?n=&amp;s=CA&amp;d=53915&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palisadeshudson.com/2012/03/a-management-failure-that-could-cost-168-million/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verdict==
The verdict in favor of Plaintiff included $3,720,488 in economic damages, $39,000,000 in non-economic damages, and $125,000,000 in punitive damages. .&lt;ref&gt; http://www.juryverdictalert.com/jury-verdicts/item/employment/chopourian-v-catholic-healthcare-west&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.morelaw.com/verdicts/case.asp?n=&amp;s=CA&amp;d=53915&lt;/ref&gt; The trial lasted 11 days and the jury deliberated for 3 days before unanimously finding in favor of Plaintiff on her claims of [[hostile work environment]], retaliation for workplace complaints, defamation, and intentional interference with economic advantage. .&lt;ref&gt; http://www.juryverdictalert.com/jury-verdicts/item/employment/chopourian-v-catholic-healthcare-west&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox cobalt}}
'''Cobalt''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Co''' and atomic number 27. Like nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural [[meteoric iron]]. The free element, produced by reductive [[smelting]], is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray [[metal]].

Cobalt-based blue pigments ([[cobalt blue]]) have been used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists to be due to the known metal [[bismuth]]. Miners had long used the name ''[[kobold]] ore'' (German for ''goblin ore'') for some of the blue-pigment producing [[minerals]]; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous [[arsenic]]-containing fumes when smelted. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the ''kobold''.

Today, some cobalt is produced specifically from one of a number of metallic-lustered ores, such as for example [[cobaltite]] (Co[[Arsenic|As]][[Sulfur|S]]). The element is however more usually produced as a by-product of [[copper]] and [[nickel]] mining. [[Copperbelt|The copper belt]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) and [[Zambia]] yields most of the global cobalt production. The DRC alone accounted for more than 50% of world production in 2016 (123,000 tonnes), according to [[Natural Resources Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Electric car future spurs Cobalt rush: Swelling demand for product breathes new life into small Ontario town|author=Danielle Bochove |work=Vancouver Sun|date=November 1, 2017|agency=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobalt is primarily used in the manufacture of [[magnetism|magnetic]], wear-resistant and high-strength [[alloy]]s. The compounds cobalt silicate and [[Cobalt blue|cobalt(II) aluminate]] (CoAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to [[glass]], [[ceramic]]s, [[ink]]s, [[paint]]s and [[varnish]]es. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable [[isotope]], cobalt-59. [[Cobalt-60]] is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a [[radioactive tracer]] and for the production of high energy [[gamma ray]]s.

Cobalt is the active center of a group of [[coenzymes]] called [[cobalamin]]s. [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B{{ssub|12}}]], the best-known example of the type, is an essential [[vitamin]] for all animals. Cobalt in inorganic form is also a [[micronutrient]] for [[bacteria]], [[algae]], and [[fungi]].

Cobalt is a weakly reducing metal that is protected from oxidation by a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivating]] [[oxide]] film. It is attacked by [[halogens]] and [[sulfur]]. Heating in [[oxygen]] produces [[Cobalt(II,III) oxide|Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] which loses oxygen at {{convert|900|C}} to give the [[Cobalt(II) oxide|monoxide]] CoO.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt; The metal reacts with [[fluorine]] ([[Fluorine|F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) at 520&amp;nbsp;K to give [[Cobalt(III) fluoride|CoF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]; with [[chlorine]] ([[Chlorine|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), [[bromine]] ([[Bromine|Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) and [[iodine]] ([[Iodine|I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), producing equivalent binary [[halides]]. It does not react with [[hydrogen gas]] ([[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) or [[nitrogen gas]] ([[nitrogen|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) even when heated, but it does react with [[boron]], [[carbon]], [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]] and sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft3rd|page=722}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ordinary temperatures, it reacts slowly with [[mineral acids]], and very slowly with moist, but not with dry, air.

==Compounds==
{{Category see also|Cobalt compounds}}
Common [[oxidation states]] of cobalt include +2 and +3, although compounds with oxidation states ranging from −3 to [[percobaltate|+5]] are also known. A common oxidation state for simple compounds is +2 (cobalt(II)).  These salts form the pink-colored [[metal aquo complex]] [Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in water. Addition of chloride gives the intensely blue {{chem|[CoCl|4|]|2-}}.&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt; In a borax bead [[flame test]], cobalt shows deep blue in both oxidizing and reducing flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7tfyCAAAQBAJ|title=Rutley’s Elements of Mineralogy|last=Rutley|first=Frank|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789401197694|page=40|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxygen and chalcogen compounds===
Several [[oxide]]s of cobalt are known. Green [[cobalt(II) oxide]] (CoO) has [[Cubic crystal system|rocksalt]] structure. It is readily oxidized with water and oxygen to brown cobalt(III) hydroxide (Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). At temperatures of 600–700&amp;nbsp;°C, CoO oxidizes to the blue [[cobalt(II,III) oxide]] (Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which has a [[spinel]] structure.&lt;ref name=greenwood&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|pages=1117–1119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black [[cobalt(III) oxide]] (Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=107|title=The history and use of our earth's chemical elements: a reference guide|author=Krebs, Robert E.|edition=2nd|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date=2006|isbn=0-313-33438-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobalt oxides are [[antiferromagnetic]] at low [[temperature]]: CoO ([[Néel temperature]] 291&amp;nbsp;K) and Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Néel temperature: 40&amp;nbsp;K), which is analogous to [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), with a mixture of +2 and +3 oxidation states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petitto|first1=Sarah C.|last2=Marsh|first2=Erin M.|last3=Carson|first3=Gregory A.|last4=Langell|first4=Marjorie A.|title=Cobalt oxide surface chemistry: The interaction of CoO(100), Co3O4(110) and Co3O4(111) with oxygen and water|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=chemistrylangell|journal=Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical|volume=281|pages=49–58|date=2008|doi=10.1016/j.molcata.2007.08.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal [[chalcogen]]ides of cobalt include the black [[cobalt(II) sulfide]]s, CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which adopts a [[pyrite]]-like structure, and [[cobalt sulfide|cobalt(III) sulfide]] (Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

[[File:Cobalt(II)-chloride-hexahydrate-sample.jpg|thumb|left|alt=purple pile of power of Cobalt(II)-chloride-hexahydrate| Cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate]]
Four [[:wikt:dihalide|dihalide]]s of cobalt(II) are known: [[cobalt(II) fluoride]] (CoF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, pink), [[cobalt(II) chloride]] (CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, blue), [[cobalt(II) bromide]] (CoBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, green), [[cobalt(II) iodide]] (CoI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, blue-black). These halides exist in anhydrous and hydrated forms. Whereas the anhydrous dichloride is blue, the hydrate is red.&lt;ref name=greenwood2&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|pages=1119–1120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduction potential for the reaction {{chem|Co|3+}} + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → {{chem|Co|2+}} is +1.92&amp;nbsp;V, beyond that for [[chlorine]] to chloride, +1.36&amp;nbsp;V. Consequently, cobalt(III) and chloride would result in the cobalt(III) being reduced to cobalt(II). Because the reduction potential for fluorine to fluoride is so high, +2.87&amp;nbsp;V, [[cobalt(III) fluoride]] is one of the few simple stable cobalt(III) compounds. Cobalt(III) fluoride, which is used in some fluorination reactions, reacts vigorously with water.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;

===Coordination compounds===
As for all metals, molecular compounds and polyatomic ions of cobalt are classified as [[coordination complex]]es, that is, molecules or ions that contain cobalt linked to several [[ligand]]s. The principles of [[electronegativity]] and [[HSAB theory|hardness–softness]] of a series of ligands can be used to explain the usual oxidation state of cobalt. For example, Co&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt; complexes tend to have [[ammine]] ligands. Because phosphorus is softer than nitrogen, phosphine ligands tend to feature the [[HSAB theory|softer]] Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, an example being tris(triphenylphosphine)cobalt(I) chloride ((P(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CoCl). The more electronegative (and harder) oxide and fluoride can stabilize Co&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; derivatives, e.g. caesium hexafluorocobaltate (Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CoF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and potassium [[percobaltate]] (K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"&gt;{{cite book|author=Holleman, A.

[[Alfred Werner]], a Nobel-prize winning pioneer in [[coordination chemistry]], worked with compounds of [[empirical formula]] [Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. One of the isomers determined was [[cobalt(III) hexammine chloride]]. This coordination complex, a typical Werner-type complex, consists of a central cobalt atom coordinated by six [[ammine]] orthogonal ligands and three [[chloride]] counteranions. Using [[chelation|chelating]] [[ethylenediamine]] ligands in place of ammonia gives [[tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III) chloride]] ([Co(en)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which was one of the first [[coordination complex]]es to be resolved into [[Chirality (chemistry)|optical isomers]]. The complex exists in the right- and left-handed forms of a "three-bladed propeller". This complex was first isolated by Werner as yellow-gold needle-like crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Werner, A. |title = Zur Kenntnis des asymmetrischen Kobaltatoms.

&lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;Co is the only stable cobalt [[isotope]] and the only [[isotope]] that exists naturally on Earth. Twenty-two [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized; the most stable, [[Cobalt-60|&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co]] has a [[half-life]] of 5.2714&amp;nbsp;years, and &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Co has a half-life of 271.8&amp;nbsp;days, &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Co a half-life of 77.27&amp;nbsp;days, and &lt;sup&gt;58&lt;/sup&gt;Co a half-life of 70.86&amp;nbsp;days. All the other [[radioactive]] isotopes of cobalt have half-lives shorter than 18&amp;nbsp;hours, and in most cases shorter than 1&amp;nbsp;second. This element also has 4 [[meta state]]s, all of which have half-lives shorter than 15 minutes.&lt;ref name="nubase"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Audi| first = G.|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| date = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.

The isotopes of cobalt range in [[atomic weight]] from 50 [[atomic mass unit|u]] (&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;Co) to 73 u (&lt;sup&gt;73&lt;/sup&gt;Co). The primary [[decay mode]] for isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the most abundant stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;Co, is [[electron capture]] and the primary mode of decay in isotopes with atomic mass greater than 59 atomic mass units is [[beta decay]]. The primary [[decay product]]s below &lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;Co are element 26 ([[iron]]) isotopes; above that the decay products are element 28 (nickel) isotopes.&lt;ref name="nubase"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Early blue and white ware circa 1335 Jingdezhen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=cobalt blue Chinese porcelain |Early Chinese blue and white porcelain, manufactured c. 1335]]
Cobalt compounds have been used for centuries to impart a rich blue color to [[glass]], [[ceramic glaze|glazes]], and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]]. Cobalt has been detected in Egyptian sculpture, Persian jewelry from the third millennium BC, in the ruins of [[Pompeii]], destroyed in 79 AD, and in China, dating from the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD) and the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644 AD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/123235/cobalt-Co Cobalt], Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''cobalt'' is derived from the German ''{{lang|mhd|kobalt}}'', from ''[[kobold]]'' meaning "goblin", a superstitious term used for the [[ore]] of cobalt by miners. The first attempts to smelt those ores for copper or nickel failed, yielding simply powder (cobalt(II) oxide) instead. Because the primary ores of cobalt always contain arsenic, smelting the ore oxidized the arsenic into the highly toxic and volatile [[arsenic(III) oxide|arsenic oxide]], adding to the notoriety of the ore.&lt;ref name="met1863" &gt;{{cite book|isbn = 978-0-202-36361-5|pages =254–256|chapter = Cobalt|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UyE49SzKWHIC&amp;pg=PA254|title = Metallurgy: 1863–1963|author1 = Dennis, W.

Swedish chemist [[Georg Brandt]] (1694–1768) is credited with discovering cobalt circa 1735, showing it to be a previously unknown element, different from bismuth and other traditional metals. Brandt called it a new "semi-metal".&lt;ref&gt;Georg Brandt first showed cobalt to be a new metal in: G.

&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that compounds of cobalt metal were the source of the blue color in glass, which previously had been attributed to the [[bismuth]] found with cobalt.

During the 19th century, a significant part of the world's production of [[cobalt blue]] (a dye made with cobalt compounds and alumina) and [[smalt]] ([[cobalt glass]] powdered for use for pigment purposes in ceramics and painting) was carried out at the Norwegian [[Blaafarveværket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramberg, Ivar B. |title=The making of a land: geology of Norway|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMVNE0F2SckC&amp;pg=PA98|accessdate= 2011-04-30 |date=2008 |publisher=Geological Society |isbn=978-82-92394-42-7|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cyclopaedia|title=Cyclopædia of useful arts &amp; manufactures|editor=C.

After World War II, the US wanted to guarantee the supply of cobalt ore for military uses (as the Germans had been doing) and prospected for cobalt within the U.S. border. An adequate supply of the ore was found in Idaho near [[Blackbird Mine|Blackbird canyon]] in the side of a mountain. The firm Calera Mining Company started production at the site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=true#v=onepage&amp;q=true&amp;f=true "Richest Hole In The Mountain"] ''Popular Mechanics'', May 1952, pp. 65–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
The stable form of cobalt is produced in [[supernova]]s through the [[r-process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode = 1980SvAL....6...61P|title=Creation of the Iron-Group Elements in a Supernova Explosion|author=Ptitsyn, D.

Free cobalt (the [[native metal]]) is not found on Earth because of the oxygen in the atmosphere and the chlorine in the ocean. Both are abundant enough in the upper layers of the Earth's crust to prevent native metal cobalt from forming. Except as recently delivered in meteoric iron, pure cobalt in native metal form is unknown on Earth. The element has a medium abundance but natural compounds of cobalt are numerous and all amounts of cobalt compounds are found in most rocks, soil, plants, and animals.

In nature, cobalt is frequently associated with [[nickel]]. Both are characteristic components of [[meteoric iron]], though cobalt is much less abundant in iron meteorites than nickel. As with nickel, cobalt in meteoric iron [[alloy]]s may have been well enough protected from oxygen and moisture to remain as the free (but alloyed) metal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rruff.info/rdsmi/V35/RDSMI35_355.pdf |title=Determination of metallic iron, nickel and cobalt in meteorites |author=Nuccio, Pasquale Mario and Valenza, Mariano |year=1979 |journal=Rendiconti Societa Italiana di Mineralogia e Petrografia |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=355–360}}&lt;/ref&gt; though neither element is seen in that form in the ancient terrestrial crust.

Cobalt in compound form occurs in copper and nickel minerals. It is the major metallic component that combines with [[sulfur]] and arsenic in the sulfidic [[cobaltite]] (CoAsS), [[safflorite]] (CoAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[glaucodot]] ((Co,Fe)AsS), and [[skutterudite]] (CoAs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) minerals.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt; The mineral [[cattierite]] is similar to [[pyrite]] and occurs together with [[vaesite]] in the copper deposits of [[Katanga Province]].&lt;ref&gt;

The main ores of cobalt are [[cobaltite]], erythrite, [[glaucodot]] and [[skutterudite]] (see above), but most cobalt is obtained by reducing the cobalt [[by-product]]s of nickel and [[copper]] mining and [[smelting]].&lt;ref name="YB2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cobalt/myb1-2006-cobal.pdf|first = Kim B.|last = Shedd|accessdate = 2008-10-26|title = Mineral Yearbook 2006: Cobalt|publisher = United States Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CR2008"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cobalt/mcs-2008-cobal.pdf|first = Kim B.|last = Shedd|accessdate = 2008-10-26|title = Commodity Report 2008: Cobalt|publisher = United States Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since cobalt is generally produced as a by-product, the supply of cobalt depends to a great extent on the economic feasibility of copper and  nickel mining in a given market. Demand for cobalt was projected to grow 6% in 2017.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/bc8dc13c-07db-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b|title=Cobalt’s meteoric rise at risk from Congo’s Katanga|author=Henry Sanderson |date=March 14, 2017|publisher=Financial Times | url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several methods exist to separate cobalt from copper and nickel, depending on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used [[ore]]. One method is [[froth flotation]], in which [[surfactant]]s bind to different ore components, leading to an enrichment of cobalt ores. Subsequent [[roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] converts the ores to [[cobalt sulfate]], and the copper and the iron are oxidized to the oxide. [[Leaching (metallurgy)|Leaching]] with water extracts the sulfate together with the [[arsenate]]s. The residues are further leached with [[sulfuric acid]], yielding a solution of copper sulfate. Cobalt can also be leached from the [[slag]] of copper smelting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page = 347| title = ASM specialty handbook: nickel, cobalt, and their alloys| author =Davis, Joseph R.|publisher = ASM International| date = 2000| isbn = 0-87170-685-7| url = https://books.google.com/?id=IePhmnbmRWkC&amp;dq=cobalt+copper+nickel+ore+separate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The products of the above-mentioned processes are transformed into the cobalt oxide (Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). This oxide is reduced to metal by the [[aluminothermic reaction]] or reduction with carbon in a [[blast furnace]].&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) currently produces 63% of the world’s cobalt. This market share may reach 73% by 2025 if planned expansions by mining producers like [[Glencore]] Plc take place as expected. But by 2030, global demand could be 47 times more than it was in 2017, Bloomberg New Energy Finance has estimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We’ll All Be Relying on Congo to Power Our Electric Cars |author=Thomas Wilson |date=October 26, 2017|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-26/battery-boom-relies-on-one-african-nation-avoiding-chaos-of-past |archive-url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-26/battery-boom-relies-on-one-african-nation-avoiding-chaos-of-past |archive-date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes that Congo made to mining laws in 2002 led did attract investment in Congolese copper and cobalt projects. However Glencore dominates the coltan market in DRC. Its Mutanda mine shipped 24,500 tons of cobalt from its Mutanda mine last year, 40% of Congo DRC’s output and nearly a quarter of global production. T Glencore’s Katanga Mining project is resuming as well and should produce 300,000 tons of copper and 20,000 tons of cobalt by 2019, according to Glencore.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

In 2005, the top producer of cobalt was the copper deposits in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]'s [[Katanga Province]]. Formerly Shaba province, the area had almost 40% of global reserves, reported the [[British Geological Survey]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) supplied 60% of world cobalt production, 32,000 tons at $20,000 to $26,000 per ton. Recent growth in production could at least partly be due to how low mining production fell during DRC Congo's very violent civil wars in the early 2000s, or to the changes the country made to its Mining Code in 2002 to encourage foreign and multinational investment and which did bring in a number of investors, including [[Glencore]]. Three of its current Congo projects 
[[Artisanal mining]] supplied 10% to 25% of the DRC production.&lt;ref name=wpDRC1/&gt; Some 100,000 cobalt miners in Congo DRC use hand tools to dig hundreds of feet, with little planning and fewer safety measures, say workers and government and NGO officials, as well as [[Washington Post]] reporters' observations on visits to isolated mines.

The political and ethnic dynamics of the region have in the past caused horrific outbreaks of violence and years of armed conflict and displaced populations. This instability affected the price of cobalt and also created perverse incentives for the combattants in the First and Second Congo Wars to prolong the fighting, since access to diamond mines and other valuable resources helped to finance their military goals—which frequently amounteed to genocide—and also enriched the fighters themselves. While DR Congo has in the 2010s not recently been invaded by neighboring military forces, some of the richest mineral deposits adjoin areas where Tutsis and Hutus still frequently clash, unrest continues although on a smaller scale and refugees still flee outbreaks of violence.&lt;ref&gt;

Cobalt extracted from small Congolese [[artisanal mining]] endeavors in 2007 supplied a single Chinese company, Congo DongFang International Mining. A subsidiary of [[Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt]], one of the world’s largest cobalt producers, Congo DongFang supplied cobalt to some of the world’s largest battery manufacturers, who produced batteries for ubiquitous products like the Apple [[iPhone]]s. Corporate pieties about an ethical [[supply chain]] were thus met with some incredulity. A number of observers have called for tech corporations and other manufacturers to avoid sourcing conflict metals in Central Africa at all rather than risk enabling the financial exploitation, [[human rights]] abuses like kidnappings for [[unfree labor]], environmental devastation and the human toll of violence, poverty and toxic conditions.

The [[Mukondo Mountain]] project, operated by the [[Central African Mining and Exploration Company]] (CAMEC) in [[Katanga Province]], may be the richest cobalt reserve in the world. It produced an estimated one third of the total global coval production in 2008.&lt;ref name=IntMining200807&gt;

==Applications==
Cobalt has been used in production of high-performance alloys.&lt;ref name="YB2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CR2008"/&gt; It can also be used to make rechargeable batteries, and the advent of electric vehicles and their success with consumers probably has a great deal to do with the DRC's soaring production. Other important factors were the 2002 Mining Code, which encouraged investment by foreign and transnational corporations such as Glencore, and the end of the First and Second Congo Wars.

===Alloys===
Cobalt-based [[superalloy]]s have historically consumed most of the cobalt produced.&lt;ref name="YB2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CR2008"/&gt; The temperature stability of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for [[gas turbine]]s and aircraft [[jet engine]]s, although nickel-based [[single-crystal]] alloys surpass them in performance.&lt;ref name="super"&gt;

===Catalysts===
Several cobalt compounds are oxidation catalysts. Cobalt acetate is used to convert [[xylene]] to [[terephthalic acid]], the precursor of the bulk polymer [[polyethylene terephthalate]]. Typical catalysts are the cobalt [[carboxylate]]s (known as cobalt soaps). They are also used in paints, varnishes, and inks as "drying agents" through the oxidation of [[drying oils]].&lt;ref name="WhyCo"/&gt; The same carboxylates are used to improve the adhesion between steel and rubber in steel-belted radial tires. In addition they are used as accelerators in [[polyester resin]] systems.

Cobalt-based catalysts are used in reactions involving [[carbon monoxide]]. Cobalt is also a catalyst in the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] for the [[hydrogenation]] of carbon monoxide into liquid fuels.&lt;ref&gt;

Before the 19th century, cobalt was predominantly used as a pigment. It has been used since the Middle Ages to make [[smalt]], a blue-colored glass. Smalt is produced by melting a mixture of roasted mineral [[smaltite]], [[quartz]] and [[potassium carbonate]], which yields a dark blue silicate glass, which is finely ground after the production.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2004">'''The European Code of Conduct for Clearing and Settlement (Code of Conduct)''' is an initiative of [[Europe]]an [[securities exchange]]s, [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing houses]] and [[Central securities depository|central securities depositories]] to set a uniform rules for trading, clearing, settlement and custody services for stocks. The Code of Conduct contains rules, which should enhance [[Transparency (market)|transparency]] for customers and improve services for cross-border transactions as well as harmonise the European [[capital market]] and revitalise the international securities traffic.

The [[Code of conduct|Code of Conduct]] was agreed on 31 October 2006 by all members of the ''Federation of European Securities Exchanges'' (FESE), the ''European Association of Central Counterparty Clearing Houses'' (EACH) and the ''European Central Securities Depositories Association'' (ECSDA).

The Code of Conduct is not only meant to guarantee an increased transparency of prices and services in the cross-border [[securities]] business, but is also supposed to stimulate the international securities traffic. Due to technical interfaces built to ensure the [[interoperability]] of diverse platforms, segregated [[accounting]] as well as newly structured services the market participants will be enabled to order Clearing, Settlement and Safekeeping at different institutions.

The Code contains rules, which should lead to the improvement of price transparency, to facilitate and open access to cross-border services (trade, clearing and settlement) and finally to separate services relating to trade, clearing settlement, and custody services and to enable the separate [[Bill (payment)|bill]]ing of these services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2293">'''Completed staff work''' is a principle of [[management]] which states that subordinates are responsible for submitting written recommendations to superiors in such a manner that the superior need do nothing further in the process than review the submitted document and indicate approval or disapproval.

In Completed Staff Work, the subordinate is responsible for identifying the problem or issue requiring decision by some higher authority. In written form such as a memorandum, the subordinate documents the research done, the facts gathered, and analysis made of alternative courses of action. The memo concludes with a specific recommendation for action by the superior.

The earliest description of the concept of Completed Staff Work appears in [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] publications,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army (January 1953) ''Army Information Digest''&lt;/ref&gt; although some sources indicate its origin to be a decade earlier from the [[Canadian Army]]. Since its early military origin, it has subsequently found favor in police management texts in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Municipal police administration by Institute for Training in Municipal Administration, 1961, Institute for Training in Municipal Administration, p.80-83&lt;/ref&gt;

James Webb, Director of the Bureau of the Budget (1946-1949), attributes the Doctrine of Completed Staff Work to President Harry S. Truman.&lt;ref name=Truman&gt;

However, a memo written and circulated by Briagadier General George A. Rehm, executive officer for the G-3, Operations section, attributes the policy to [[General MacArthur]]'s headquarters in the [[Douglas MacArthur in World War II|Southwest Pacific Areas]] during [[World War 2]].&lt;ref name=Rehm_memo20080928&gt;

[[File:Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers Figure 3 Network of ownership flows between countries.jpg|thumb|"Uncovering [[Offshore Financial Centers]]": CORPNET's map of connections between countries]]

'''Conduit OFC''' and '''Sink OFC''' is an empirical quantitative method of classifying [[corporate tax haven]]s, [[offshore financial centres]] and [[tax havens]].&lt;ref name="guar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/25/netherlands-and-uk-are-biggest-channels-for-corporate-tax-avoidance|title=Netherlands and UK are biggest channels for corporate tax avoidance|publisher=The Guardian|date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloom"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-31/is-the-u-k-already-the-kind-of-tax-haven-it-claims-it-won-t-be|title=Is the U.K. Already the Kind of Tax Haven It Claims It Won't Be?|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloom2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-11/tax-havens-can-be-surprisingly-close-to-home|title=Tax Havens Can Be Surprisingly Close to Home|publisher=Bloomberg View|date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than analyzing taxation and legal structures to identify and classify potential tax havens (the preferred EU, IMF, and OECD route), this approach analyses the ownership chains of 98 million global companies (a purely empirical, or outcomes–based, route), relative to the size of countries of their incorporation.  The technique gives both a method of classification and a method of understanding the relative scale of corporate tax havens/offshore financial centers.

The results were formally published by the University of Amsterdam's CORPNET Group in July 2017, and identify two major classifications:

*  24 global Sink OFCs: jurisdictions in which a disproportional amount of value disappears from the economic system (i.e. the traditional [[tax havens]]).&lt;br&gt;(See the table below for the list of Sinks)
*  5 global Conduit OFCs: jurisdictions through which a disproportional amount of value moves toward sink OFCs (i.e. modern [[corporate tax haven]]s).&lt;br&gt;(Conduits are: Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Singapore and Ireland)

{{quote|Our findings debunk the myth of tax havens{{efn|name="def"|As discussed in the ''Definitions'' sections of [[tax havens]], and of [[offshore financial centres]], most tax academics consider the terms as being synonymous and use them inter–changeably}} as exotic far–flung islands that are difficult, if not impossible, to regulate.

The lack of an accepted [[Tax haven#Definitions|definition]] for identifying corporate tax havens/offshore financial centres, results in different lists, including:

There are common "classic" tax haven locations amongst these lists (i.e. the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands and Jersey etc.) which some global regulators have either blacklisted, or have issued formal warnings/threat of sanctions against, unless transparency is increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/05/eu-blacklist-names-17-tax-havens-and-puts-caymans-and-jersey-on-notice| title=EU blacklist names 17 tax havens and puts Caymans and Jersey on notice| publisher=The Guardian | date=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/02/paradise-to-blacklist-eu-tax-havens| title=From paradise to blacklist: EU’s net starts to close on tax havens| publisher=The Guardian | date=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key difference between the lists regards the major corporate tax havens (or offshore financial centres), like Ireland the Netherlands and Luxembourg (amongst others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.caymancompass.com/2017/08/01/new-study-offers-more-nuanced-look-at-offshore-finance/|title=New study offers more nuanced look at offshore finance| publisher=Cayman Compass | date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major regulators like the EU and the OECD don't regard them as tax havens, and point to their transparency and compliance with international regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/there-is-a-definition-of-a-tax-haven-and-ireland-doesnt-make-that-grade-35095264.html|title=There is a definition of a tax haven - and Ireland doesn't make that grade|publisher=Irish Independent|date=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/oced-ireland-tax-haven-1005122-Jul2013/|title=OECD tax chief: 'Ireland is not a tax haven'|publisher=thejournal.ie|date=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/140279|title=EU countries are not 'tax havens', parliament says|publisher=EU Observer|date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nltimes.nl/2017/12/06/eu-releases-tax-haven-blacklist-netherlands|title=EU RELEASES TAX HAVEN BLACKLIST; NETHERLANDS NOT ON IT|publisher=NL Times|date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics and other non–governmental organizations, however, point to their role in major corporate tax avoidance from [[base erosion and profit shifting]] (“BEPS”) schemes, like the [[double Irish]], the [[Double Irish arrangement#Replacement by single malt|single malt]] and the [[dutch sandwich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/oxfam-tax-haven-3133714-Dec2016/|title=Ireland named world's 6th worst corporate tax haven|publisher=journal.ie|date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2016/09/15/now-brazil-says-ireland-tax-haven/|title=Now Brazil puts Ireland on its tax haven blacklist|publisher=Tax Justice Network|date=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/oxfam-says-ireland-is-a-tax-haven-judged-by-eu-criteria-1.3307370?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Foxfam-says-ireland-is-a-tax-haven-judged-by-eu-criteria-1.3307370|title=Oxfam says Ireland is a tax haven judged by EU criteria|publisher=Irish Times|date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfamireland.org/sites/default/files/upload/pdfs/mantras-myths-final.pdf|title=MANTRAS AND MYTHS: A true picture of the corporate tax system in Ireland|publisher=RTE News|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They regard them as major tax havens in their [[Tax haven#Definitions|definitions of tax havens]].

The report was the result of a multi–year investigation by political economists and computer scientists in the CORPNET research group at the University of Amsterdam.  CORPNET is a European Research Council funded group at the University of Amsterdam investigating networks of corporate control.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifcreview.com/restricted.aspx?articleId=12682|title=Sinks and Conduits: Identifying Offshore Financial Centres by using Big Data|publisher=IFC Review|date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report used the Moody's [[Bureau van Dijk|Orbis corporate database]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bvdinfo.com/en-us/blog/transfer-pricing/-uncovering-offshore-financial-centers-conduits-a| title='Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers: Conduits and Sinks in the Global Corporate Ownership Network' - and how Orbis helped|publisher=Moodys BUREAU VAN DIJK|date=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to examine 98 million global companies and their 71 million ownership connections (using [[big data]] computer modelling) to identify 5 global Conduit OFCs (Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore and Switzerland). These are countries of high financial reputation (i.e. not formally labelled "tax havens" by OECD/EU), but who have "advanced" legal and tax structuring vehicles (and SPVs) that help legally route funds to the 24 tax havens (called Sink OFCs), without incurring tax in the Conduit OFC (or even tax in the source of funds location, where [[royalty payment]] schemes can be used).&lt;ref name="xx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tjn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2017/07/25/new-research-key-role-major-economies-play-global-tax-avoidance/| title=New research on key role major economies play in global tax avoidance|publisher=Tax Justice Network|date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/these-five-countries-are-conduits-for-the-worlds-biggest-tax-havens-79555| title=These five countries are conduits for the world’s biggest tax havens|publisher=theconversation.com|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work builds on methods established in the "Offshore–Intensity Ratio",&lt;ref name="fir"/&gt; and in particular the understanding activity relative to the scale of the domestic economy in a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://corpnet.uva.nl/apple-multinationals-avoid-taxes-accountability-network-study-offshore-finance/| title=How Apple and Other Multinationals Avoid Taxes and Accountability: A Network Study of Offshore Finance|publisher=CORPNET|date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At its crudest level, the Offshore-Intensity Ratio explains why the countries at the top of global [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP per capita]] lists are mostly [[tax haven]] types.

The EU Parliament's Policy Department on Economic and Scientific Policies included the research in its findings for the EU Committee on Money laundering, tax avoidance and tax evasion (PANA),&lt;ref name="pana1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eppgroup.eu/PANA| title=PANA Committee on Money laundering, tax avoidance and tax evasion|publisher=EU Parliament|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by tabulating against existing EU–IMF–FSI tax–haven lists, showed material gaps in EU understanding of conduits.&lt;ref name="pana2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/115250/PANA%202016-04%20ST%20Offshore%20activities%20Final.pdf| title=Offshore activities and money laundering: recent findings and challenges|page=39|publisher=EU Parliament|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CORPNET's top 5 Conduits and top 5 Sinks are 9 of the 10 largest tax havens identified in 2010 by one of the academic founders of tax haven research, [[James R. Hines Jr.]].  Hines' 2010 list of [[James R.

==Conduit OFC==
{{see also|Corporate haven#GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy}}

Conduit OFCs are described as having advanced legal and tax systems designed to enable corporations to route funds from high tax locations (e.g. Germany) to the Sink OFCs (e.g. Bermuda). They tend to have attractive "holding company" regimes (e.g. no withholding taxes, foreign dividends exempt from taxes, capital gains reliefs, full double–tax relief), advanced tax treatment of intellectual property regimes, and large global networks of bilateral [[tax treaties]].&lt;ref name="xx"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/these-five-countries-are-conduits-for-the-worlds-biggest_us_5975f0aee4b0f1feb89b4500| title=These Five Countries Are Conduits For The World’s Biggest Tax Havens|publisher=Huffington Post| date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ft1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ft.com/content/b83e697a-c625-11e7-b2bb-322b2cb39656| title=Stranger than paradise: the truth about tax|publisher=Financial Times| date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CORPNET's five major Conduit OFCs, all have a top–ten ranking in the 2018 ''[[Global Intellectual Property Center|Global Innovation Property Centre]] (GIPC) IP Index''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalipcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GIPC_IP_Index_2018.pdf|title=GIPC IP Index 2018|date=February 2018|author=[[United States Chamber of Commerce]]|quote=Figure I: U.S. Chamber International IP Index 2018, Overall Scores|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IP has been described as the "raw materials of corporate tax avoidance",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bnrbeurs.nl/2017/02/22/the-corporate-tax-avoidance-toolbox/| title=The Corporate Tax Avoidance Toolbox|publisher=B&amp;R Beurs|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the leading corporate tax avoidance vehicle".&lt;ref name="ucla"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/62-1-1.pdf | title=Intellectual Property Law Solutions to Tax Avoidance | author=Andrew Blair-Stanek|quote=Intellectual property (IP) has become the leading tax-avoidance vehicle.| publisher=UCLA Law Review |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fordam"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordhamiplj.org/2016/08/30/ip-tax-avoidance-ireland/ | title=Intellectual Property and Tax Avoidance in Ireland | publisher=[[Fordham Intellectual Property, Media &amp; Entertainment Law Journal]] | date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conduit OFCs tend to be dominated by major law firms and global accounting firms, who create the lawfully constructed vehicles that make the Sink OFC connections, by exploiting legislative [[loopholes]] such as the [[double Irish]] and [[dutch sandwich]]. They advise clients (and the Government) on anticipating future changes (e.g. from OECD BEPS processes), that may need new loopholes.&lt;ref name="apple"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/apple-taxes-jersey.html|title=After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits|publisher=New York Times|date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xx"/&gt;  They write most of the State's relevant SPV legislation (where they create the new loopholes) through detailed lobbying and representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/matheson-lobbied-oecd-to-dilute-proposed-tax-rules-1.2601058?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Fmatheson-lobbied-oecd-to-dilute-proposed-tax-rules-1.2601058| title=Law firm Matheson lobbied OECD to dilute proposed tax rules|publisher=Irish Times | date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ie/Documents/Tax/ie-Tax-Coffey-Review-Public-Consultation-Paper.pdf| title=Consultation Paper on Review of Ireland’s Corporation Tax Code|publisher=Deloitte| date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ireland-needs-to-stay-ahead-of-the-corporate-tax-reform-game-1.3218774?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fireland-needs-to-stay-ahead-of-the-corporate-tax-reform-game-1.3218774| title=Ireland needs to stay ahead of the corporate tax reform game|publisher=Irish Times| date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ft1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.somo.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/tax-games-the-race-to-the-bottom.pdf| title=Tax Games|publisher=EURODAD|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of legal and tax structuring is considered beyond the trust–structuring type work of the [[offshore magic circle]] firms.  Conduit OFCs need structures that can integrate with bilateral tax treaties involving G20 countries, as well as meeting U.S. GAAP / SEC Regulations that U.S. multinationals (one of the largest users of Conduit OFCs) need to adhere to.

These top 5 global Conduit OFCs channel 47% of corporate offshore connections and have different attributes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uva.nl/en/content/news/press-releases/2017/07/highly-developed-countries-canalise-almost-50-of-equity-flows-to-tax-havens.html| title=Highly developed countries canalise almost 50% of equity flows to tax havens|publisher=CORPNET| date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sink OFC==
[[File:List of sink-OFCs, ordered by sink centrality value.png|thumb|"Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers": List of Sink OFCs ordered by value (showing U.K. dependencies)]]

Sink OFCs cover a broad range of locations from very small counties (e.g. the Marshall Islands), to major global [[financial centres]] (e.g. Hong Kong).

Just because funds reach a Sink OFC, does not mean that they remain dormant.  Quite the contrary, the funds can be invested in assets all over the world, but their legal ownership and future gains remain in the Sink OFC.  For example, the circa $1 trillion of US company offshore cash, is held in Sink OFCs (esp. Caribbean).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-real-story-behind-us-companies-off-shore-cash-reserves| title=The real story behind US companies' offshore cash reserves | publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/20/us-corporate-giants-hoarding-over-a-trillion-dollars-apple-microsoft-google| title=US corporate giants hoarding more than a trillion dollars | work=The Guardian | date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report highlighted some interesting aspects of the 24 Sink OFCs:
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
| British Virgin Islands – in terms of connections, is the "Netherlands of Sink OFCs" and heavily linked with the Conduit OFC United Kingdom.
| Luxembourg and Hong Kong – would have been considered Conduit OFCs, but the research shows they are even bigger Sink OFCs (i.e. longer–term homes for funds), Luxembourg (for routing funds from high–tax EU countries) and Hong Kong (for routing funds out of China)
| Jersey – remains a unique link with major Conduit OFC, Switzerland (because the study could not capture individual "trusts", Jersey could be understated).
| Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Triad – these three classic offshore tax havens are heavily interlinked and starting to present as one large Sink OFC.
| Taiwan – has been a controversial entrant on several tax haven lists (the [[Tax Justice Network]] calls Taiwan the "Switzerland of Asia",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2016/02/10/taiwan-the-un-noticed-asian-tax-haven/|title=Taiwan, the un–noticed Asian tax haven?|publisher=Tax Justice Network|date=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Taiwan is not on any EU/OECD/IMF tax-haven list), and is identified as the 2nd largest Asian Sink OFC.

}}
CORPNET highlighted the lack of progress the OECD [[Base erosion and profit shifting]] ("BEPS") project is making, and that the OECD's support of transparent [[intellectual property]]–based tax structuring (or patent/knowledge boxes), is incompatible with the emerging position of intellectual property as the leading [[BEPS]] tool in conduit OFCs.&lt;ref name="un1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2017/09/11/new-un-tax-handbook-sets-lower-income-countries-oecd-beps/|title=New UN tax handbook: Lower–income countries vs OECD BEPS failure|publisher=Tax Justice Network| date=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reasons for this failure are discussed in [[Corporate haven#Failure of OECD BEPS Project|failure of OECD BEPS Project]].

An example of an IP–based [[Base erosion and profit shifting|BEPS tool]] is Ireland's [[double Irish arrangement#Backstop of capital allowances|capital allowances for intangible assets]] ("CAIA") tool, also known as the "[[Ireland as a tax haven#Green Jersey|Green Jersey]]", which has an [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Effective tax rate (ETR)|effective tax rate]] of 0–3%.  Apple used the CAIA (or Green Jersey) BEPS tool in Q1 2015 (and created the noted Irish "[[leprechaun economics]]" restatement of GDP).  Ireland has other IP–based [[Base erosion and profit shifting|BEPS tools]] (Ireland as the first OECD nexus-compliant [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Knowledge development box|KDB]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/oecd-gives-cautious-welcome-to-knowledge-box-tax-scheme-30685281.html|title=OECD gives cautious welcome to Irish Knowledge Box tax scheme|publisher=Irish Independent|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a supporter of the [[Base erosion and profit shifting (OECD project)|OECD BEPS project]] (see box).

==Isle of Man omitted==
The Isle of Man (the "IOM") was absent from the list of top Sink OFCs.  The IOM appears on tax–haven lists and ranks 42 on the 2018 [[Financial Secrecy Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2018-results| title=Financial Secrecy Index 2018| publisher=Tax Justice Network| date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/PDF/IsleofMan.pdf| title=Report on the Isle of Man| publisher=Tax Justice Network| date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chief Minister of the IOM, [[Howard Quayle]], announced that the CORPNET report proved that the IOM is not a tax haven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/article.cfm?id=35167&amp;headline=We%27re%20no%20tax%20haven%20study%20concludes&amp;sectionIs=news&amp;searchyear=2017| title=We're no tax haven study concludes | publisher=IOM Today | date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://business-reporter.co.uk/2017/11/07/isle-man-closely-mirrors-uk-rules-says-chief-minister/?getcat=2934| title=Isle of man ‘closely mirrors’ UK rules, says Chief Minister| publisher=Daily Telegraph Business Reporter | date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, CORPNET researchers from the University of Amsterdam directly replied to Howard Quayle's article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://corpnet.uva.nl/response-to-howard-quayle-chief-minister-of-isle-of-man/| title=Response to Howard Quayle, Chief Minister of Isle of Man| publisher=CORPNET| date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; clarifying that while the IOM does not appear as a leading Sink OFC for corporate tax avoidance, it does not mean that individuals (personal bank accounts and trusts) do not use the IOM to avoid taxes, and particularly United Kingdom VAT.

Other commentators have added that the IOM is "failing as a tax haven", and is now too small to appear in major studies like the CORPNET research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2017/08/02/the-isle-of-man-is-failing-at-being-a-tax-haven/| title=The Isle of Man is failing at being a tax haven| publisher=Tax Research UK| date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CORPNET report uses corporate connections on the [[Bureau van Dijk|Orbis database]], rather than the quantum of money, as its primary metric of analysis.  In theory, the authors feel that this does not impede the goal of classification, and of making relative rankings.  However, it does mean the amount of potential tax avoidance is ignored.&lt;ref name="xx"/&gt;

Acclaimed author on tax havens and offshore financial centers, [[Gabriel Zucman]], uses a different quantitative approach.  Zucman focuses on macro–data of national statistical accounts.  In theory, the total assets in a system should equal the total liabilities.  By aggregating national account data, Zucman can identify an excess of liabilities over assets, implying that the missing assets (to balance the equation), are hidden in tax–havens.  On this basis, in 2015, he estimated that 8% of the world's wealth (or $7.6 trillion) was "missing" in offshore tax–havens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/opinion/a-piketty-proteges-theory-on-tax-havens.html|title=The True Cost of Hidden Money|publisher=New York Times |date=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zucman's analysis highlights the special case of Ireland and why the Orbis database underestimates Ireland's scale as one of the world's largest corporate tax avoidance, or [[base erosion and profit shifting|BEPS]], hubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/08/tax-havens-dodging-theft-multinationals-avoiding-tax|title=The desperate inequality behind global tax dodging|publisher=The Guardian| date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US multinationals dominate Ireland's economy, using it as a shield from the US "worldwide tax" system (pre 2017 [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|TCJA]] leglislation).&lt;ref name="her"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Territorial Tax System Would Create Jobs and Raise Wages for U.S. Workers|url = https://www.heritage.org/taxes/report/territorial-tax-system-would-create-jobs-and-raise-wages-us-workers|publisher = The Heritage Foundation|date = 12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are 14 of Ireland's 20 largest firms,&lt;ref name="itimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top1000.ie/companies| title=Ireland's Top 1000 Companies | publisher=Irish Times| date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; directly employ one–quarter of the labour force,&lt;ref name="oecdx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/investment/IRELAND-trade-investment-statistical-country-note.pdf|title=IRELAND Trade and Statistical Note 2017|publisher=OECD|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; pay 80% of all business taxes,&lt;ref name="ctx1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/research/corporation-tax-returns-2016.pdf|title=An Analysis of 2015 Corporation Tax Returns and 2016 Payments|publisher=Revenue Commissioners|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and create 57% of non–farm private sector OECD value–add.&lt;ref name="oecdx"/&gt; There are no non–US/non–UK foreign firms in Ireland's top 50 firms by turnover (and only one by employees, Lidl).&lt;ref name="itimes"/&gt; When Apple restructured its Irish subsidiaries in January 2015, it caused Irish GDP to rise 26.3% and Irish GNP to rise 18.7% (became the [[leprechaun economics]] affair).

Zucman's analysis shows many of Ireland's US multinationals don't appear on Orbis (Facebook), or only have a small fraction of their data on Orbis (Google and Apple).  Analysed using "quantum of funds" (not "Orbis connections"), Zucman shows Ireland is one of the largest corporate tax shelters in the world, and a route for Zucman’s estimated loss of 20% in EU corporate tax revenues annually.&lt;ref name="zuc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/TWZ2018Slides.pdf|page=35|title=The Missing Profits of Nations|author=[[Gabriel Zucman]]|publisher=[[National Bureau of Economic Research]], Working Papers| date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporations-push-profits-into-tax-havens-as-countries-struggle-in-pursuit-study-says-1528634659|title=Zucman:Corporations Push Profits Into Corporate Tax Havens as Countries Struggle in Pursuit, Gabrial Zucman Study Says|quote=The new research draws on data from countries such as Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands that hadn’t previously been collected.|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

He was born in [[Bucharest]], and worked at a chemical equipment factory there from 1986 to 1991, rising to design engineer in 1990. Between 1992 and 2004, he held management positions at three different firms involved in import/export and consulting.&lt;ref name="cvsenator"/&gt; He paused his business activity from 1997 to 1998, when he was an adviser to the [[Ministry of Youth and Sport (Romania)|Youth and Sport Minister]], the future PNL President [[Crin Antonescu]].&lt;ref name="cvsenator"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vlasov"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mirela Corlăţan, Lucian Gheorghiu, [http://old.cotidianul.ro/guvernul_patriciu_fenechiu-24193.html "Guvernul Patriciu-Fenechiu" ("The Patriciu-Fenechiu Government")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827045809/http://old.cotidianul.ro/guvernul_patriciu_fenechiu-24193.html |date=2010-08-27 }}, ''Evenimentul Zilei'', 2 April 2007; accessed August 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 he graduated from the Faculty of Statistics, Cybernetics, and Computer Science of the [[Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies]], earning a doctorate in economics there in 2006.

=== Tab ===

In November 2013, Ananta founded '''Tab''' (Tab Payments) in Toronto to help diners pay the bill through their phone in restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blogto.com/tech/2014/06/get_to_know_a_toronto_startup_tab/ |title=Get to know a Toronto startup: Tab|publisher=BlogTO|date= |accessdate=2014-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.utoronto.ca/pay-summerlicious-restaurant-meals-and-more-tap-finger-u-t-alumni-startup-tab |title=Pay for Summerlicious restaurant meals and more with the tap of a finger: U of T alumni startup, Tab|publisher=University of Toronto|date= |accessdate=2014-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tab is a mobile application used to close the bill at restaurants.

'''Failure of consideration''' is a technical [[legal]] term referring to situations in which one person confers a benefit upon another upon some condition or basis ("[[consideration]]") which fails to materialise or subsist. It is also referred to as "failure of basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1479&amp;context=blr |author=Camp T |title=Restitution on a Partial Failure of Basis}} (2016) 28 Bond Law Review 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an '[[English unjust enrichment law|unjust factor]]' for the purposes of the [[English unjust enrichment law|law of unjust enrichment]]. Where there is a "total failure of consideration" the claimant can seek restitution of the benefit by bringing an action in unjust enrichment against the defendant. Historically speaking, this was as a [[Quasi-contract|quasi-contractual]] claim known as an [[Money had and received|action for money had and received to the plaintiff's use]] for a consideration that wholly failed. The orthodox view is that it is necessary for any relevant contract to be ineffective, for example because it is discharged for [[Breach of contract|breach]], [[Void (law)|void]] ''ab initio'' (from the beginning) or [[Frustration in English law|frustrated]]. However, it will be available on a subsisting contract where it does not undermine the contractual allocation of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|153|2007|litigants=Coshott v Lenin |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure of consideration is a highly technical area of law. Particular areas of controversy include:
*Whether the failure of the consideration must be 'total',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UWALawRw/2006/6.pdf |last=Tarrant |first=J |title=Total Failure of Consideration}} (2006) 33(1) University of Western Australia Law Review 132.&lt;/ref&gt; and the scope and meaning of such a requirement;
*Whether 'consideration' refers not only to bargained-for counter-performance by the defendant, but also a legal or factual state of affairs;
*Whether this ground of restitution only applies to money claims or also extends to non-money benefits (e.g., [[Personal property|chattels]], services);  
*Whether this ground of restitution can be relied upon by a contract-breaker;
*Whether the (now ineffective) contract has any impact upon (a) the availability of a claim; or (b) the valuation of any such claim;  
*Whether a failure of consideration can also generate [[Unjust enrichment#Remedies for unjust enrichment: personal and proprietary restitution|proprietary remedies]] (e.g., a resulting trust);  
*Whether a claimant can elect to terminate a contract for breach and escape a 'bad bargain' by suing in unjust enrichment on the ground of total failure of consideration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2072">'''Helmut Niedermeyer''' (28 February 1926 – 3 February 2014) was an Austrian businessman and entrepreneur. He founded [[Niedermeyer]], which was once the largest consumer electronics chain in Austria.

==Biography==

Niedermeyer was born in [[Opava]] in what is now the [[Czech Republic]]. His mother died shortly after his birth. His father, a successful cafe owner, served seven years in a Nazi [[concentration camp]]. Helmut Niedermeyer was a volunteer for the Soviets for five years. After the war, the family moved to [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=Kurier&gt;{{cite news|title=Trauer um Helmut Niedermeyer|url=http://kurier.at/wirtschaft/unternehmen/trauer-um-helmut-niedermeyer-ein-kaufmann-vom-scheitel-bis-zur-sohle/49.766.105|accessdate=20 February 2014|newspaper=[[Kurier]]|date=4 February 2014|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508184039/http://kurier.at/wirtschaft/unternehmen/trauer-um-helmut-niedermeyer-ein-kaufmann-vom-scheitel-bis-zur-sohle/49.766.105|archivedate=8 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his career as a salesman in 1949.&lt;ref name=Kurier/&gt; In 1957 he founded the company Niedermeyer AG as X-ray, photo and film products business. The company and its branches grew, and in the 1980s and 1990s became Niedermeyer-Konzem through various acquisitions. Niedermeyer retired from the board of the company in 1997. Two years later, it was sold to [[T-Mobile]] and changed ownership several times. It went bankrupt in 2013.&lt;ref name=DiePresse&gt;{{cite news|title=Unternehmer Helmut Niedermeyer gestorben|url=http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/1558385/Unternehmer-Helmut-Niedermeyer-gestorben|accessdate=17 February 2014|newspaper=[[Die Presse]]|date=4 February 2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=February 2008}}

A bargaining '''impasse''' occurs when the two sides negotiating an agreement are unable to reach an agreement and become deadlocked. An impasse is almost invariably mutually harmful, either as a result of direct action which may be taken such as a [[strike action|strike]] in employment negotiation or sanctions/military action in [[international relations]], or simply due to the resulting delay in negotiating a mutually beneficial agreement. The word impasse may also refer to any situation in which no [[Social progress|progress]] can be made. Impasses provide opportunities for [[problem solving]] to provide an [[insight]] that leads to progress.

Some theorists contend that impasses are used by negotiating parties in situations of imperfect information as a method of signalling to the other side the seriousness of their position. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Impasse provides a credible signal that a party’s position is genuine and not merely an [[ambit claim]].

Impasse may also arise if parties suffer from [[self-serving bias]]. Most disputes arise in situations where facts are able to be interpreted in multiple ways, and if parties interpret the facts to their own benefit they may be unable to accept the opposing party’s claim as reasonable. They may believe the other side is either bluffing or acting unfairly and deserves to be "punished".

As bargaining impasse is mutually harmful, it may be beneficial for the parties to accept binding [[arbitration]] or [[mediation]] to settle their dispute, or the state may impose such a solution. Indeed, compulsory arbitration following impasse is a common feature of [[industrial relations law]] in the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opm.gov/lmr/glossary/glossaryb.asp Glossary A&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere.

The '''Innenstadt''' (''inner city'') is the central city district of [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]]. It is part of the ''[[Ortsbezirk (Frankfurt am Main)|Ortsbezirk]] Innenstadt I''. Its western part forms part of Frankfurt's [[central business district]], the [[Bankenviertel]]. Germany's most expensive shopping streets and real estate are found within the city district.

The Innenstadt stretches in the north and east round the district of [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]]. Other adjacent districts to the west are [[Bahnhofsviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Bahnhofsviertel]], in the north west the [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]], [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]] to the north and [[Ostend (Frankfurt am Main)|Ostend]] to the east. In the south, the Innenstadt is bordered naturally by the [[Main (river)|Main]] on the opposite bank of which stands the [[Apfelwein|Applewine]] quarter known as [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]].

The Innenstadt and Altstadt were formed within the borders made up of the ''Anlagen'' (stretches of grassy park land) lying to the right of the Main and are thereby clearly recognisable on the city plan.

The enclosures of park land of a contrast to the skyscrapers and the banking quarter. The [[Zeil]], Frankfurt's most famous street, as well as the central squares [[Hauptwache (Frankfurt am Main)|Hauptwache]] and [[Konstablerwache]], the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] and the [[Alte Oper]], can be found in the Innenstadt. On the [[Freßgass]] the bankers and office workers from the nearby office blocks often have lunch.

==Areas and quarter, streets and squares==
The Innenstadt is divided, from west to east, in into the following parts:

===Altstadt===
The [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] is the historical old town district of Frankfurt. It was [[Bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II|devastated in World War II]], but parts of it are reconstructed, most recently at the [[Dom-Römer Project]].

===Bankenviertel===
[[Image:Hauptwache-fussgaengerzone-ffm-evak-01.jpg|thumb|left|Panorama from ''Zeilgalerie'' (2010)]]
The [[Bankenviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Bankenviertel]] (banking district) lies on both sides of the [[Taunusanlage]] and is shared between the boroughs of the Innenstadt, Bahnhofsviertel and the Westend. Most credit institutes in the eastern banking quarter are situated in Neue Mainzer Straße, Große Gallusstraße, Junghofstraße and the surrounding streets. All these streets are locations for skyscrapers, whose highest is the 259 metre [[Commerzbank Tower]].
[[Image:Boerse-ffm001.jpg|thumb|''[[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]]'']]
The southern part of the quarter shows a greater range of use, especially along Kaiserstraße and at Kaiserplatz. The [[Frankfurter Hof]], one of the best known hotels in the city, is located here. In Großer Hirschgraben, the border with the Altstadt, lies one of the cultural highlights of the city, the [[Goethe House]].

===Opernviertel===
The main axis of the north western part of the Innenstadt (opera quarter) is Große Bockenheimer Straße, running from [[Rathenauplatz]] to [[Opernplatz]], as a result of the many places to eat better known as the [[Fressgass|Freßgass]]. The southern [[Goethestraße]] which runs parallel to the Freßgass is the most expensive shopping street in the city. To the north [[Kaiserhofstraße]], another expensive street, borders Freßgass. The Opernplatz which lies within the parks of the old city walls is considered to be one of the most beautiful squares in the city. The [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] lies in the shopping street called Schillerstraße.

The successive squares Rathenauplatz, Goetheplatz and Roßmarkt form the intersection to the neighbouring quarters around the Zeil.

The streets around the Freßgass are one of the focus points of Frankfurt's nightlife. In Kleine Bockenheimer Straße is the Jazzkeller (jazz cellar), an important cultural institution offering live [[jazz]] with local and internationally renowned musicians.

===Zeil and surroundings===
[[Image:Zeil-ffm001.jpg|thumb|End of the ''Zeil'' at ''Hauptwache'']]
[[Image:Rossmarkt-ffm018.jpg|thumb|left|Rossmarkt with ''Gutenberg-Memorial'']]
The pedestrian zone of the [[Zeil]] and its end points of Hauptwache and Konstablerwache are the central point for shopping in the city. Between the large department stores are shopping centres like the [[Zeilgalerie]] (now demolished and being replaced) and [[MyZeil]]. Other important streets begin at Hauptwache such as the Roßmarkt, Steinweg, Schillerstraße and Große Eschenheimer Straße. In the latter of these the [[Palais Thurn und Taxis]] used to stand, which has now been reconstructed, as well as important buildings from the post-war years like the ''Fernmeldehochhaus'' and the ''[[Frankfurter Rundschau|Rundschau-Haus]]''. At its north end stands the [[Eschenheimer Turm]], a relict of the city fortifications of the late [[Late Middle Ages|Middle Ages.]] The [[Katharinenkirche, Frankfurt|Katharinenkirche]], the main Protestant church of Frankfurt, stands at Hauptwache; on Bleichstraße the {{ill|Peterskirche (Frankfurt)|lt=Peterskirche|de|Peterskirche (Frankfurt am Main)}}, with its preserved cemetery, is the only green space in the district. The area between Konstablerwache and Alte Gasse is the centre of the gay and lesbian community of Frankfurt.

===Gerichtsviertel===
The north eastern Innenstadt (courts quarter) is bordered by the eastern half of the Zeil, Konrad-Adenauer-Straße and the Friedberger Anlage. The law courts and its numerous buildings, including the higher regional court, the regional court, and an institute for remand can be found around this area in Heiligkreuzgasse. Several vocational colleges can be found in a noteworthy 1950s multi-story building on Seilerstraße.

The courts are supposed to be moved to new buildings on Adickesallee in Nordend in the forthcoming years, the character of the courts quarter would therefore completely change and new uses would be found for the area.

In Heiligkreuzgasse lies Frankfurts well known variety show, the [[Tigerpalast]]. The Odeon on the Anlagenring at Seilerstraße is a classic exhibition pavilion which was built for [[Simon Moritz von Bethmann]]. Nowadays this is used as a disco.

===Allerheiligenviertel===
The small quarter (All Saints quarter) between the Zeil and Battonnstraße forms a multicultural island in a city otherwise dedicated to commerce. The Breite Gasse forms a second [[red light district]] after that of the Bahnhofsviertel. The city library is located close to the Zeil and on Lange Straße there are several city council departments. With the reconstruction of the newly laid Kurt-Schumacher-Straße these council offices overlap the [[Frankfurter Judengasse]], a [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe|Jewish Ghetto]].

===Fischerfeldviertel===
The south eastern quarter of the Innenstadt was first built-up in the early 19th century, after the previous boggy area was drained out. The Börneplatz synagogue was located at Börneplatz up until the destruction of the synagogue during the [[Kristallnacht]] programme in 1938 and it was a centre of [[Judaism|Jewish]] life in Frankfurt. The Jewish cemetery in Battonnstraße is one of the oldest in Europe. Besides this the central offices for public services and the local labour office can be found in the Fischerfeldviertel.

==History==

===The settlement of the Neustadt===
[[Image:Frankfurt Eschenheimer Turm-Stadtmauer 1790.jpg|thumb|The Eschenheimer Turm]]
Today's Innenstadt was located outside the town walls until the 14th century. Other than the exposed parks the area was already built-up. Thus a row of houses developed from a cattle market to the north of the walled in town and this market lent its name to the new street: the Zeil. Highways ran to the east and west of that through the town gates into adjacent areas, such as the homes of [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] and the Bockenheimer fort, in which there were already houses and gardens.

The establishment of the Neustadt began in the year 1333, when Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Ludwig der Bayer]] of the free realm approved of an expansion which would provide three times the previous area to the town. In the time soon after, the town erected new fortifications with five towers: The Gallustor (also Mainzer or Galgentor) on the site of the modern day Willy-Brandt-Platz, the Bockenheimer Tor on the site of the current Opernplatz, the Eschenheimer Tor, the Friedberger Tor and the Allerheiligentor. In the course of the following years the town's new area was filled with streets and buildings, whereby above all rich cloth dealers used the opportunity to establish representative domiciles for themselves outside the narrow old parts of the town. The Eschenheimer Turm, the most glorious tower of the new fortifications, was finished in 1428.
[[Image:Chasechallenge2007-ffm002.jpg|thumb|left|At present time]]

The first churches in Neustadt were two small chapels near Bockenheimer gate: the Heiligkreuz chapel of a poor hospital in 1346 as well as the neighbouring Kloster chapel of the Holy Katharina and Barbara in 1354. From the latter the larger seventeenth century Katharinenkirche developed. In the north of the Neustadt the Peterskirche was constructed in 1381, which has been the parochial church of the Neustadt since 1453. Aside from this a cemetery was laid out in this location in 1452, which became the only cemetery on the right side of the main after the closure of the cathedral in 1508. Until the opening of today's main cemetery in 1828 the Peterskirchhof (which was extended several times in the years between) remained the most important cemetery in the town. In 1453 another church was built in the Neustadt, the Maternkapelle at Roßmarkt.

In the 15th century there were still numerous areas of undeveloped land and many gardens in the Neustadt. The Altstadt was, at to this time, still the preferential quarter of the city, the Neustadt was settled mainly by immigrants flowing from the country into the increasing city. In the 16th century the old city ditch (which was the last deer ditch in 1584) between Altstadt and Neustadt was filled in.

===Grand bourgeois buildings===
[[Image:Frankfurt Palais Thurn und Taxis Corps de Logis.jpg|thumb|Palais Thurn und Taxis]]
In the following era gradually the weight of the city shifted between the old and the new town, the new town houses of rich citizens were now built in the Neustadt. These served as accommodation for the royal delegations of emperors who held their coronations in the city. The best known city palace was the Palais Thurn und Taxis of 1737 in Große Eschenheimer Straße. A few years prior to this in 1730 the still preserved police headquarters were built in the heart of the Neustadt. On the Zeil, in particular, a number of representative community centres and the palace of Barckhausen developed in the 18th century. The palace was used for three years as an imperial residence due to [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbacher]] [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Karl VII's]] war with [[Austria]] preventing him from moving back into his [[Munich]] residence.

In the active developmental period of the classic era, the best known house of the time is the Goethe House in the Großer Hirschgraben of the Neustadt. In 1755 an urban horse stable was set up at Roßmarkt. In 1782 the [[Komödienhaus]] (comedy house), the first definite sign of the future of theatres in Frankfurt, was built on today's Rathenauplatz. Land development of the Fischerfeld in the southeast of the new city began in 1792 from the plans of the architect general, [[Johann George Christian Hess]]. The most important of the buildings developed there was municipal library on the bank of the Main, sketched by Hess, which opened in 1825.

In 1804, during continuing occupation by [[France|French]] troops in the [[Coalition Wars]], the city council decided upon the removal and replacement of the city walls. In the course of the following years a barrier of plants was put in place which is still there as the Anlagen (parks) of today. The plants were placed under the protection of a decree in 1807 which prevented further land development on the now natural barrier.

The Neustadt became the scene of [[Frankfurter Wachensturm|revolutionary events in 1833]]: particularly the watch towers at Hauptwache and Konstablerwache. The [[Frankfurt Parliament|national assembly in Frankfurt]] met in 1848/9 in the [[Paulskirche, Frankfurt|Paulskirche]], the largest and most modern hall of the city located in the Altstadt. However, the different political and parliamentary groups met in accommodation and cafés throughout the Neustadt.

A monument to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] was erected at Roßmarkt in 1844, which was moved to the Gallusanlage where it has stood since 1952. 1858 saw the erection of a monument for [[Johannes Gutenberg]] which was also placed in Roßmarkt, and another for [[Friedrich Schiller]] in 1864 which initially stood at Hauptwache but was moved to [[Goetheplatz]] in 1878 and then to the Taunusanlage in 1955. It was late in the city's history before it decided on the construction of a monument to [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], which was set up in the Gallusanlage but later melted down in 1940. The citizens of Frankfurt established a venue in Junghofstraße as a festival and concert hall in 1859. The new main synagogue was inaugurated in Börnerstraße in 1860, and in 1882 another synagogue followed at Börneplatz.

===The Neustadt as a large modern city===
[[Image:Oper1880.jpg|thumb|The opera house]]
After the [[Austro-Prussian War]], Frankfurt quickly developed into one of the more modern cities of Germany. Until that point the wide, meshed road system of the Neustadt had been consolidated by tearing down houses and other areas to allow for splendorous boulevards. After 1870, Kaiserstraße and Kaiserplatz became the main connection between Hauptwache and the western train stations. In 1876, the hotel Frankfurt Hof opened on Kaiserplatz, from which point on it was known as the "First House on the Square". After further demolition the new Zeil, Schillerstrasse and Goethestrasse were laid. The extension of the Neue Mainzer Straße was finished in 1874 with a bridge named Untermainbrücke. The newly built home of the stock exchange was opened in 1879 close to Hauptwache. The opera house was established and inaugurated in 1880 following the donations of Frankfurt's citizens. The new law courts were opened in Heiligkreuzstrasse in 1889 and followed by the theatre in Untermainanlage in 1902.

The rapid process of growth in the new city led to the formation of a town centre. The previous residential districts developed into a commercial and business centre and the residents were soon ejected from the area.

The trams were changed to electrical operation from 1899, whereby the city had a modern and efficient traffic service. The central traffic node of the trams was situated at Hauptwache, numerous lines lead through the Zeil, which developed into a road of large department stores.

In the years after the first world war the emphasis of the development concerning town construction shifted more towards the outside quarters. The medieval parts of the city centre fell victim, as those in the Gothic Altstadt did, to the numerous allied air raids of 1943-44.

Above all the reconstruction considered the needs of urban traffic and accepted modern town planning. Thus, completely new traffic axles were laid, for instance, Konrad-Adenauer-Strasse and the Zeil were considerably widened during their reconstruction. The redevelopment of the city centre brought the Innenstadt into the 1960s. The building of the underground system changed and from 1963, after intense construction measures, a large underground rapid-transit station was built underneath Hauptwache and Konstablerwache. The Zeil and the Freßgas were turned into pedestrian zones and until 1986 most tram lines were shut down. In the western part of the Innenstadt a banking quarter formed around the model of the American Central Business Districts. Since the 1970s this western part has seen numerous new skyscrapers, the best known of which include the [[Eurotower (Frankfurt am Main)|Eurotower]] at Willy-Brandt-Platz and the [[Commerzbank Tower]] at Kaiserplatz.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6235">'''Jean-Claude Larréché''' (born 3 July 1947) is a French [[organizational theorist]], and the Alfred H. Heineken Chaired Professor of marketing at [[INSEAD]], a post he has held since 1993. He is known for his pioneering work in the use of computer simulations (i.e. [[simulation games]]) in marketing training, his work at INSEAD on marketing excellence and customer focus, and his book ''[[The Momentum Effect]]''.

== Biography ==
Larréché received his degree for Ingénieur en électronique from INSA, Lyon in 1968, his MSc in Computer Science from the [[University of London]] in 1969, his MBA, INSEAD and his PhD at the Graduate School of Business of the Stanford University.

After completing his MBA in 1970 Larreche was working as a research assistant an INSEAD when he was asked to assist L’Oreal assess a computerised marketing model they were considering purchasing. He was fascinated by it and "decided to investigate the best places in the world to study marketing modelling." {{Harv|Mazur|Miles|2007|p=49}}. Larréché is quoted as saying that he chose Stanford for his PhD so that he could study under Dave Montgomery, one of the founders of marketing modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Mazur|Miles|2007|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1974 and 1977, working with an assistant, [[Hubert Gatignon]], he developed his work on marketing modelling to create a teaching simulation called [[Markstrat]] {{Harv|Mazur|Miles|2007|p=50}}. Markstrat is a game where teams of students compete against each other in an artificial world under realistic market conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Meixner &amp; Rainer Haas, “Markstrat Simulation: Distance Learning for Marketing Students”, Paper presented at the 6th Annual EDEN Conference – Budapest, June 1997, http://www.boku.ac.at/mi/markstrat/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that Markstrat is now used in 8 out of the top 10 business schools in the world and 25 of the top 30 schools in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.stratxsimulations.com/simulation/strategic-marketing-simulation/|title=Strategic marketing simulation game -Markstrat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. More recently he developed the simulation [http://www.digbusinesslearning.com/ ''''''DiG - Discovery Innovation Growth] a versatile learning tool to develop competencies in innovation, customer centricity, value based marketing, business acumen, leadership and team performance (&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digbusinesslearning.com/what-we-do-dig-leadership-game/|title=DIG - Business simulation game and leadership training|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

In 1983, at the age of just 36 Larréché was appointed to the board of Reckitt &amp; Coleman (now [[Reckitt Benckiser plc]]) in a non-executive role after previously working for the firm in a consultancy capacity {{Harv|Mazur|Miles|2007|pp=56–7}}. He remained on the board for 18 years. He founded a consultancy business, [http://stratxcorporate.com/about/ StratX], in 1984. {{Harv|Mazur|Miles|2007|p=52}}. The company currently offers experiential learning programs for top corporations and universities worldwide.

During the 1990s Larreche’s work began to concentrate on the underlying capabilities that impact on a business’s ability to compete in the marketplace. He published a series of reports based on surveys conducted with more than 1200 executives in hundreds of Fortune 1000 companies.&lt;ref&gt;''The Competitive Fitness of Global Firms''. (1998-2002). Financial Times Management/Financial Times Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; The surveys attempted to define and evaluate the attributes, characteristics and behaviours of large global firms and assess their impact on corporate performance. That work, combined with computer modelling and his long-time work on customer focus,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. Larreche's INSEAD executive education program "From Customer Focus: From Promise to Action"&lt;/ref&gt; converged on the concept of “momentum” – an attempt to map out a process for improving the efficiency of a firm’s growth. The culmination of this period of Larreche’s work was the publication in 2008 of ''The Momentum Effect: How to ignite exceptional growth'' {{Harv|Larreche|2008}}.

He received the following awards:
* 1995 – Marketing Educator of the Year, Club 55, the European Community of Marketing Experts.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Cary L. ''Who's Who in the Management Sciences''. 2000. Edward Elgar Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-84064-237-7}}. p 276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1350">'''John Thomas Bell''' (1878–1965) was, together with his two sons, the founder of [[Bellway]], one of the [[United Kingdom]]'s largest housebuilding businesses.

==Career==
The son of William Bell and Mary Jane Craig, "J.T" was brought up in [[Seaton Burn|North Seaton]], Northumberland. He worked in the stone quarry by day and built his first houses by night. He formed his own building business (probably after the First War) and in the 1920s built 400 to 500 houses in the Newbiggin area. His business failed in the 1930s slump and he returned to being a manager for another builder.&lt;ref&gt;Tycoons of Tyne and Tees ''The Sunday Sun'' 28 June 1969&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946 his two sons, John and Russell, joined him and re-launched the business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2t1SMok2938C&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Bellway+founded+1946+John+T+Bell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wx5w69MnAe&amp;sig=K__EYmMwFeEalWZkszIotrb4fo8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VVC4Sfm7HJm1jAeR6aGwCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result British Housebuilders by Fred Wellings Page 120]&lt;/ref&gt; John Bell died in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Bellway-Plc-Company-History.html Bellway at Funding Universe]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LexisNexis Group''' is a corporation providing [[computer-assisted legal research]] as well as business research and risk management services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/25/technology/25westlaw.html?_r=1&amp;ref=reedelsevier | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first=Ashlee | last=Vance | title=Legal Sites Plan Revamps as Rivals Undercut Price | date=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/02/business/company-news-a-name-change-is-planned-for-mead-data-central.html?src=pm | work=The New York Times | title=COMPANY NEWS; A NAME CHANGE IS PLANNED FOR MEAD DATA CENTRAL | date=December 2, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
During the 1970s, LexisNexis pioneered the electronic accessibility of legal and journalistic documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203721704577157211501855648?KEYWORDS=lexisnexis | newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | first=Stephen | last=Miller | title=For Future Reference, a Pioneer in Online Reading | date=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, the company has the world's largest electronic database for legal and public-records related information.&lt;ref name=twosix/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:LexisNexis.JPG|thumb|LexisNexis office in Markham, a suburb of Toronto, Ontario, Canada]]
Currently a division of [[RELX Group]] (formerly Reed Elsevier),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/06/business/the-media-business-reed-elsevier-building-big-presence-in-the-us.html?src=pm | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first=Edward A. | last=Gargan | title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Reed-Elsevier Building Big Presence in the U.S. | date=October 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; LexisNexis was first a product of the Mead Data Central company.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=twosix&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2006/12/01/Lexis-Nexis-founder-Don-Wilson-dies/UPI-36121164992489/ |title=Lexis-Nexis founder Don Wilson dies |website=UPI.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglo-Dutch publishing company [[Reed Elsevier]] has owned LexisNexis and its predecessor company since 1994. At its inception in 1970, the database was named LEXIS by Mead Data Central (MDC), a subsidiary of the [[Mead Paper|Mead Corporation]]. It was a continuation of an experiment organized by the Ohio State Bar in 1967.

On April 2, 1973, LEXIS launched publicly, offering full-text search in all Ohio and New York cases. In 1980, LEXIS completed its hand-keyed electronic archive of all U.S. federal and state cases. The NEXIS service, added that same year, gave journalists a searchable database of news articles.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the capital letters in the name; it was then standard to capitalize the names of online services.&lt;/ref&gt;  LexisNexis' world headquarters is located in [[New York City]], United States.&lt;ref name="Corporate"/&gt; In 1989, MDC acquired the Michie Company, a legal publisher, from [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Macmillan Agrees to Sell Michie to Mead | agency = Associated Press | accessdate = 2014-08-23 | url = http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Macmillan-Agrees-to-Sell-Michie-to-Mead/id-c5740ca1895b2bc50f15e9f481161d1d }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Toyota Motor Corporation|Toyota]] launched the [[Lexus]] line of luxury vehicles in 1987, Mead Data Central sued for [[trademark infringement]] on the grounds that consumers of upscale products (such as lawyers) would confuse "Lexus" with "Lexis". A market research survey asked consumers to identify the spoken word "Lexis". Survey results showed that a nominal number of people thought of the computerized legal search system; a similarly small number thought of Toyota's luxury car division.&lt;ref&gt;A far greater number, although by no means a majority, thought of a television character; most thought of nothing at all.&lt;/ref&gt; A judge ruled against Toyota, and the company appealed the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-04/business/fi-194_1_lexus-cars |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Distinctiveness of 'Lexis' Trademark Cited Toyota Can't Call Car 'Lexus,' Judge Says |date=January 4, 1989 |author=James Risen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mead Data Cent. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A.'' 702 [[F.Supp.]] 1031 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Mead lost on appeal in 1989 when the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit]] held that there was little chance of consumer confusion.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?case=10399856046401781554 Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. Toyota Motor Sales]'' 875 [[F.2d]] 1026 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the two companies have an amicable business relationship, and in 2002 implemented a joint promotion called "Win a Lexus on Lexis!"

In December 1994, Mead sold the LexisNexis system to Reed Elsevier for $1.5 billion.  The U.S. state of [[Illinois]] subsequently audited Mead's income tax returns and charged Mead an additional $4 million in income tax and penalties for the sale of LexisNexis; Mead paid the tax under protest, then sued for a refund in an Illinois state court.  On April 15, 2008, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] agreed with Mead that the Illinois courts had incorrectly applied the Court's precedents on whether Illinois could constitutionally apply its income tax to Mead, an out-of-state, Ohio-based corporation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[MeadWestvaco Corp. v. Illinois Dep't. of Revenue]]'', 553 U.S. 16 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court reversed and remanded so that the lower courts could apply the correct test and determine whether Mead and Lexis were a "unitary" business.

In 2000, LexisNexis purchased RiskWise, a [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/03/business/company-news-nexis-agrees-to-purchase-of-riskwise-international.html | work=The New York Times | title=COMPANY NEWS; NEXIS AGREES TO PURCHASE OF RISKWISE INTERNATIONAL | date=June 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2000, the company acquired the American legal publisher Matthew Bender from [[Times Mirror Company|Times Mirror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Barringer| first = Felicity| title = THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Times Mirror Sells Legal Unit To British-Dutch Publisher| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-02-04| date = 1998-04-28| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/28/business/the-media-business-times-mirror-sells-legal-unit-to-british-dutch-publisher.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 it acquired a Canadian research database company, [[Quicklaw]]. In 2002, LexisNexis acquired the Ohio legal publisher Anderson Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Anderson Publishing - LexisNexis Company Information| accessdate = 2018-04-28| url = https://www.lexisnexis.com/presscenter/mediakit/anderson.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Reed Elsevier Group, parent company of LexisNexis, purchased Seisint, Inc, from founder [[Michael Brauser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/us/politics/14giuliani.html | work=The New York Times | title=Giuliani Firm Stood to Benefit From U.S. Deals, Florida Company’s Files Show | date=December 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Boca Raton, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/business/company-news-reed-elsevier-to-acquire-seisint-for-775-million.html | work=The New York Times | title=COMPANY NEWS; REED ELSEVIER TO ACQUIRE SEISINT FOR $775 MILLION | date=July 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seisint housed and operated the [[Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange]] (MATRIX).

On March 9, 2005, LexisNexis announced the possible theft of personal information of some Seisint users. It was originally estimated that 32,000 users were affected,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/03/09/news/midcaps/lexisnexis/index.htm | work=CNN | title=LexisNexis customer IDs stolen | date=2005-03-09 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that number greatly increased to over 310,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/04/12/technology/personaltech/lexis/?cnn=yes | work=CNN | title=LexisNexis acknowledges more ID theft | date=2005-04-12 | accessdate=2010-05-07 | first1=Caleb | last1=Silver}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affected persons were provided with free fraud insurance and credit bureau reports for a year. However, no reports of identity theft or fraud were discovered to have stemmed from the security breach.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In February 2008, Reed Elsevier purchased [[data aggregator]] [[ChoicePoint]] (previous NYSE ticker symbol CPS) in a cash deal for US$3.6 billion.  The company was rebranded as LexisNexis Risk Solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/risk/ |title=LexisNexis Risk Solutions |publisher=LexisNexis.com |accessdate=2014-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, LexisNexis Risk Solutions bought Health Market Science (HMS), a supplier of high quality data about US healthcare professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20141113/NEWS/311139944|author=Adam Rubenfire|title=LexisNexis to acquire Health Market Science|work=Modern Healthcare|date=13 November 2014| accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal content offerings==
LexisNexis services are delivered via two websites that require separate paid [[subscription]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9906/04/college.idg/index.html?iref=allsearch |work=CNN |title=Surf your way into college |date=June 4, 1999 |author=Jennifer Peltz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a company news release, LexisNexis hosts over 30 [[terabyte]]s of content on its 11 mainframes (supported by over 300 midrange UNIX servers and nearly 1,000 Windows NT servers) at its main [[datacenter]] in [[Miamisburg, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/presscenter/mediakit/datacenter.asp |title=Data Center Facts for LexisNexis |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110101452/http://www.lexisnexis.com/presscenter/mediakit/datacenter.asp |website=Lexisnexis.com |date=2014-03-19 |archive-date=2006-10-10|accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lexis database contains current [[United States]] statutes and laws and a large volume of published case opinions dating from the 1770s to the present, as well as publicly available [[Non-publication|unpublished]] case opinions from 1980 onward. In 2000, Lexis began building a library of briefs and motions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2006_Feb_28/ai_n26775689/ |publisher=Business Network |title=LexisNexis Litigation Services Enhanced with Briefs, Motions, Pleadings |date=February 28, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119164740/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2006_Feb_28/ai_n26775689/ |archivedate=November 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, Lexis also has libraries of statutes, case judgments and opinions for jurisdictions such as [[France]], [[Australia]], Canada, [[Hong Kong]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United Kingdom]] as well as databases of law review and legal journal articles for countries for which materials are available.

Previously, LexisNexis had a stripped-down free version (known as LexisOne) but this has been discontinued
and replaced by Lexis Communities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/community/portal/ LexisNexis® Legal Newsroom]. Lexisnexis.com (2013-08-05). Retrieved on 2013-08-27.&lt;/ref&gt; which provides news and blogs across a variety of legal areas.

[[Time Matters]] is a LexisNexis-branded software offering.  Lexis for Microsoft Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/products/lexis-for-microsoft-office.page |title=Lexis® for Microsoft Office® – Better Legal Drafting |website=LexisNexis.com |date=2014-03-19 |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a LexisNexis-branded software offering.

In France, the UK and Australia, LexisNexis publishes books, magazines and journals, both in hard copy and online. Titles include ''[[Taxation Magazine]]'' and ''Lawyers Weekly''.

===LexisNexis UK===
The organization that eventually became LexisNexis UK was founded in 1818 by Henry Butterworth (1786–1860) .&lt;ref name="LexisNexis website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk |title=LexisNexis UK – Butterworths – Tolley Innovative Business, Legal Solutions |website=Lexisnexis.co.uk |date=2014-03-13 |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a pupil at [[King Henry VIII School, Coventry|King Henry VIII School]], [[Coventry]]. After leaving Coventry he was apprenticed to and, for some time, worked for his uncle [[Joseph Butterworth]], the great law bookseller of [[Fleet Street]]. In 1818, however, disagreement between them as to the terms of partnership made Henry set up on his own account at the corner of Middle Temple Gate (7 Fleet Street), where he became the well-known Queen's Law Bookseller.

Butterworths was acquired by [[International Publishing Corporation]] in 1965; IPC was acquired by the Reed Group in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = FOB: Firms Out of Business| accessdate = 2018-04-28| url = http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/watch/fob_search_results.cfm?FOBFirmName=Butterworths&amp;FOBNote=&amp;fob-submit.x=0&amp;fob-submit.y=0&amp;fob-submit=Submit}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] Professional Publishing was merged with Butterworths Scientific in 1990 to form [[Butterworth-Heinemann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-1-4831-0372-3| pages = –| last = Medlik| first = S.| title = Managing Tourism| chapter = Publisher's note| date = 2016-06-06|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gB6TDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=butterworths%20scientific%20reed%20international&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Butterworths publishing business is now owned and operated in the UK by Reed Elsevier (UK) Ltd, a company in the [[Reed Elsevier]] Group. Publications continue to be produced by RELX (UK) Ltd using the "LexisNexis", "Butterworths" and "Tolley" trade marks. Such publications include ''[[Halsbury's Laws of England]]'' and the ''[[All England Law Reports]]'', amongst others.

The Butterworths name is also used to publish works in many countries such as Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

LexisNexis also produces a range of software, services and products which are designed to support the practice of the legal profession. For example, case management systems, customer relationship management systems ("CRMs"), practice management systems, electronic disclosure systems, background checking and identity verification products.&lt;ref name="LexisNexis website"/&gt;

==Censorship==

Pursuant to instructions from Chinese authorities, in 2017 LexisNexis withdrew Nexis and LexisNexis Academic from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Reuters]] |title=LexisNexis withdrew two products from Chinese market |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-censorship-journal-lexisnexis-idUSKCN1B21D6 |first=Kate |last=Holton |editor-first=Louise |editor-last=Heavens |date=August 27, 2017 |access-date=August 29, 2017 |quote=“Earlier this year LexisNexis Business Insight Solutions in China was asked to remove some content from its database,” LexisNexis said in a statement. “In March 2017, the company withdrew two products (Nexis and LexisNexis Academic) from the Chinese market.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sheshunoff | Pratt==
In 2013, LexisNexis, together with [[Reed Elsevier]] Properties SA, acquired publishing brands and businesses of Sheshunoff and A.S.

SIS was founded in 1971 by Alex and Gabrielle Sheshunoff. The company became recognized for providing guidance and analysis to the banking industry. In 1988 Thompson Media, a division of Thompson Reuters, acquired the company. Separately, the Sheshunoffs began publishing Alex Information products.

In 1995 SIS acquired A.S. Pratt &amp; Sons. Established in 1933, ''Pratt's Letter'' is believed to be the second oldest continuously published newsletter in the country behind ''Kiplinger's Washington Letter'', which began publication in 1923. A.S. Pratt is a provider of regulatory law and compliance work tools for the financial services industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-45364762.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611075043/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-45364762.html |archivedate=2014-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabrielle Sheshunoff returned in 2004 to unite the AlexInformation, Sheshunoff, and A.S. Pratt brands before it was sold to Thompson in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thompsonmediagroupllc.com/brands/sheshunoff/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021030208/http://www.thompsonmediagroupllc.com/brands/sheshunoff/ |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cupid as Link Boy by Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|right|''Cupid as a Link Boy'', [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], c. 1771.]]
A '''link-boy''' (or '''link boy''' or '''linkboy''') was a [[boy]] who carried a flaming [[torch]] to [[light]] the way for [[pedestrians]] at night. Linkboys were common in [[London]] in the days before [[street lighting]]. The linkboy's fee was commonly one [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]], and the torch was often made from burning [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] and [[tow]].

Link-boys and their torches also accompanied litter vehicles, known as [[Litter (vehicle)|sedan chairs]], that were operated by chairmen.&lt;ref name="sedan"&gt;[http://www.thisisbath.com/ Bath Chronicle] (December 2, 2002) ''Sedan Chairs Ride Again.'' Page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Where possible, the link boys escorted the fares to the chairmen, the passengers then being delivered to the door of their lodgings.&lt;ref name="sedan"/&gt;  

Several houses in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], UK, and many in London still have the link extinguishers on the exteriors, shaped like outsized candle snuffers ''(see image, right)''.

The term derives from "link", a term for the [[cotton]] tow that formed the [[Candle wick|wick]] of the torch. Links are mentioned in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV, part 1]]'', as [[Falstaff]] teases [[Henry IV, Part 1|Bardolph]] about the [[flushing (physiology)|shining redness of his face]]:
:"''Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt tavern and tavern.''" (Act III, scene 3)
[[File:Link extinquisher.jpg|thumb|right|[[Georgian period in British history|Georgian]] link extinguisher on a house in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], UK]]
Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] painted ''Cupid as a Link Boy'', now held by the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]] in [[Buffalo, New York]].  In that painting, little Cupid as a London linkboy wears demonic bat wings and an immense phallic torch to "remind those in the know of the proclivities of a certain patron."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Robert.  (March 31, 1986)  [[Time (magazine)|Time]] ''Mixing grandeur and tattiness - At the Royal Academy, a retrospective of Sir Joshua Reynolds.'' Art section, page 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another appears in the first plate of [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[The Four Stages of Cruelty]]'', putting out the eyes of a bird using a hot needle heated in the flame of his torch.  Hogarth depicts a linkboy again, in plate four, ''Night'', of his ''[[Four Times of the Day]]'', this time huddled beneath a bench blowing on his torch.

In the mid-eighteenth century Laurence Casey, who was known as ''Little Cazey'', became the personal linkboy of the famous courtesan [[Betty Careless]], and gained something of reputation as a troublemaker. He features [[Louis Peter Boitard]]'s 1739 picture ''The Covent Garden Morning Frolick'', leading the sedan chair containing Betty and being ridden by [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Captain "Mad Jack" Montague]] (seafaring brother of the [[Earl of Sandwich]]). [[Henry Fielding]] considered Montague, his companion Captain Laroun, and Casey "the three most troublesome and difficult to manage of all my Bow Street visitors". Casey was eventually transported to America in 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wits, Wenchers and Wantons - London's Low Life: Covent Garden in the Eighteenth Century|first=E.J.|last=Burford|publisher=Hale|pages=57, 70|year=1986|isbn=0-7090-2629-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[thieves' cant]], a linkboy was known as a "Glym Jack" ("glym" meant "light") or a "moon-curser" (as their services would not be required on a [[moonlight|moonlit]] night).  Employing a linkboy could be dangerous, as some would lead their clients to dark alleyways, where they could be beset by [[footpad]]s.&lt;ref name="Vulgar Tongue"&gt;'[http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/dcvgr10.txt ''1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222103/http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/dcvgr10.txt |date=27 September 2007 }}'' Grose, et al. originally published in 1811. Hosted on [[Project Gutenberg]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Linkboys make brief appearances in the novels of [[William Makepeace Thackeray|William Thackeray]] and [[Charles Dickens]], and are mentioned by [[Samuel Pepys]] &lt;ref name="Pepys's Diary 1660 -1669"&gt;''[http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1661/09/10/ The Diary of Samuel Pepys]''.Pepys's diary entry 10 September 1661 mentions Pepys's use of a linkboy to light his way home along the streets of London.&lt;/ref&gt; in his diary. An anonymous illustrated serial novel, ''The Link Boy of Old London'', was published in the [[penny dreadful]] ''Boys Standard'' from 4 November 1882.

The expression "cannot hold a candle to" (meaning "inferior to") may derive from a comparison to an inadequate linkboy.&lt;ref name="Col En"&gt;''[http://www.translationdirectory.com/glossaries/glossary014_o.htm Glossary of Colloquialisms]''. Belinsky, Natalya. Part of [http://www.fluent-english.ru the Fluent English Educational Project]. Hosted on TranslationDirectory.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Upendran, S. (21 August 2001) [[The Hindu]] ''Know your English.'' (answering "What is the meaning and origin of the expression "Can't hold a candle to someone"? (T.D.V. Raman, Chennai)")&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Renaissance]], a person walking home after dark typically would have hired a linkboy to light the way with a candle or torch – then considered a low-status position.&lt;ref name="Answers"&gt;Roeper, Richard.  (13 January 1987) [[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] "20/20 Answers." Features livestyle section, page 1E (from the [[Chicago Sun-Times]])&lt;/ref&gt;  If you could not hold a candle to somebody, that means you were not even good enough to be their linkboy.&lt;ref name="Answers"/&gt;

[[File:MARIA GUERRERO.JPG|thumb|210px|María Guerrero]]
'''María Guerrero Torija''' (April 17, 1867 - January 23, 1928) was a prominent Spanish theatre actor, producer and director.

==Life and work==
María Guerrero Torija was born in [[Madrid]] in 1867. She enrolled at the Official School of Declamation, in the prestigious [[Madrid Royal Conservatory]], where she was trained in the theatre with dramatist [[Teodora Lamadrid]]. Guerrero debuted in 1885 and later performed for [[José de Echegaray]], one of the principal figures in the [[Culture of Spain]], at the time. She later performed for French dramatist [[Benoît-Constant Coquelin]], and with [[Sarah Bernhardt]].&lt;ref name=vanguardia&gt;[http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.es/preview/1928/01/24/pagina-27/33206838/pdf.html?search=María%20Guerrero,%201928 ''La Vanguardia'' (24 January 1928) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

She married [[Fernando Díaz de Mendoza y Aguado|Fernando Díaz de Mendoza]], the Marquess of San Mamés, in 1896, and the following year, the couple relocated to [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. A commercial success at the local [[Teatro Odeón]], her productions of [[zarzuela]]s and adaptations of classics in [[Spanish literature]] (particularly [[Lope de Vega]]'s) took her company to theatres nationwide. Retaining contractual obligations in Spain, the couple purchased Madrid's ''Teatro de la Princesa'' in 1908. The couple also set aside a share of their fortune in 1918 for the construction of a new, grand theatre house in Buenos Aires. The project caught the attention of both local high society and the King of [[Spain]], [[Alfonso XIII]], who collaborated with its construction by commissioning artisanal material for the theatre, named in honor of Spain's legendary novelist and dramatist, [[Miguel de Cervantes]].&lt;ref name=cervantes&gt;[http://www.teatrocervantes.gov.ar/sitio/site/teatro/historia.php Teatro Cervantes: historia {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cervantes Theatre (Buenos Aires)|Cervantes Theatre]] was inaugurated in 1921 with a production of Lope de Vega's ''[[La dama boba]]'' (''The Foolish Lady''). The proliferation of theatres in Buenos Aires and the advent of the [[Communications in Argentina#Radio|radio in Argentina]] soon eroded the Cervantes' audience base, however, and in 1926, the couple was forced to auction the institution, which was purchased by the Argentine government. They then returned to Madrid, where Guerrero died in 1928, at the age of 60.&lt;ref name=cervantes/&gt;

The Teatro de la Princesa was purchased by the Spanish government following her death and in 1931, it was renamed the ''[[Teatro María Guerrero]]''.&lt;ref name=vanguardia/&gt; Among her grandchildren were the well-known Spanish actor, [[Fernando Fernán Gómez]].

His father, [[Jan Mol]], co-founded a software company in 1966 called [[Volmac]]; the company itself turned out to be a huge success and Jan Mol sold it in 1992 to [[Capgemini|CAP Gemini]].&lt;ref name="jan mol net worth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.therichest.org/celebnetworth/business/tech-millionaire/jan-mol-net-worth/ |title=Jan Mol Net Worth |publisher=Celebrity Net Worth |accessdate= 13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, Jan Mol's fortune was estimated at around [[Pound sterling|£]]450m.&lt;ref name="jan mol net worth"/&gt;

After obtaining a [[Master of Science|MSc]] degree in [[Computer Science]] from [[Leiden University]], Michiel himself went into the software business. In 1993 he set up ''[[Lost Boys (company)|Lost Boys]]'' with several of his friends, developing software for the [[CD-ROM]] market. With the rapid growth of the [[internet]], the company then started making internet software as well as moving into game development. Mol had his first venture into [[Formula One]] in 1999, when he and his company sponsored driver [[Jos Verstappen]]. Lost Boys then merged with [[Sweden|Swedish]] company ''IconMedialab''.

Mol remained on the board and kept the ''Lost Boys Games'' division, before establishing a new company called ''Media Republic'', aiming to use new technology to market products. ''Lost Boys Games'' was transformed into ''[[Guerrilla Games]]'', notable for developing the [[PlayStation 2]] game [[Killzone]], during 2004 and a year later it  was sold to the [[Sony|Sony Company]].

==Formula One==
Mol later became a supporter of [[Christijan Albers]], after Verstappen left Formula One, and led a group of investors that put together a deal to buy into [[Spyker Cars]] and take over the [[Midland F1]] team. Mol is now a major shareholder in Spyker and in September 2006 was appointed as F1 director of Spyker for a period of four years.

On 14 August 2007, Michiel Mol left Spyker Cars as CEO amid speculation that it and Spyker F1 would be separated due to financial problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =The Spyker revolution begins| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns19524.html| date =2007-08-15| accessdate =2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007 [[Spyker F1]] was sold to Indian businessman [[Vijay Mallya]] and renamed [[Force India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =  FIA approve Spyker's Force India name change | publisher = Formula One Administration Ltd | url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/10/7036.html| date =2007-10-24| accessdate =2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mol remains as director and co-owner.

With the bankruptcy of Force India halfway through 2018 and the takeover of the assets by a consortium led by [[Lawrence Stroll]] (father of [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] driver [[Lance Stroll]]), Mol no longer held any rights in Force India.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Space Expedition Corporation==
Mol is a co-founder of Space Expedition Corporation (SXC), which intends to offer suborbital space tourism flights and scientific research missions out of Space Port Curaçao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XCOR Aerospace and Space Expedition Curaçao sign eight-figure wet lease contract for Lynx suborbital spacecraft|url=http://www.xcor.com/press-releases/2011/11-09-19_XCOR_and_SXC_sign_eight_figure_wet_lease_for_lynx.html|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That company was since renamed [[XCOR_Aerospace]] and filed for bankruptcy in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XCOR Files for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy|url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2017/11/09/xcor-files-chapter-7-bankruptcy/|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In July 2004, Mol married Paulien Huizinga, former [[Miss Universe Netherlands]] and now a Dutch TV personality. They lived together in Blaricum. Together they have a daughter and a son. On 3 August 2011 it was announced that Huizinga and Mol will divorce after a marriage of seven years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraaf.nl/prive/10297523/__Paulien_gaat_scheiden__.html Paulien Huizinga gaat scheiden] - website of the Dutch Newspaper [[De Telegraaf]] ''([[Dutch language|Dutch]])''&lt;/ref&gt; Mol is currently seeing Marlous Mens, a younger daughter of Harry Mens, a Dutch [[real estate broker]] and well-known TV personality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://starlounge.celebs.nl.msn.com/index.cfm?objectid=139217 Harry Mens: "Mijn dochter is verliefd op Michiel Mol"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327102400/http://starlounge.celebs.nl.msn.com/index.cfm?objectid=139217 |date=2012-03-27 }} - website [[MSN]] Entertainment ''([[Dutch language|Dutch]])''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Jersey Generals''' were a franchise of the [[United States Football League]] (USFL) established in 1982 to begin play in the spring and summer of 1983. The team played three seasons from 1983 to 1985, winning 31 regular-season games and losing 25 while going 0–2 in postseason competition. Home games were played at [[Giants Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], which was called [[Meadowlands Sports Complex|The Meadowlands]] for Generals games.

==Uniforms==
Team colors were scarlet, white, royal blue and sunflower gold. The primary logo was a gold five-star general wreath. Team helmets were solid scarlet with the logo decal on each side and a white face-mask. Home uniforms featured red jerseys with white numbers trimmed in royal blue, with numbers on the sleeves and no striping; pants were white with a single wide red stripe trimmed in blue down the sides from hip to knee. Road jerseys were white with red numbers trimmed in blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funwhileitlasted.net/tag/new-jersey-generals/|title=New Jersey Generals Archives - Fun While It Lasted|work=Fun While It Lasted}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team was the second in the New York metropolitan area to be known as "Generals," since there was a professional soccer team in the late 1960s known as the [[New York Generals]].

==History==

===1983===
From the beginning, USFL founder [[David Dixon (businessman)|David Dixon]] placed a premium on putting a team in the New York area. Initially, real estate magnate and future U. S. president [[Donald Trump]] was tapped to own the team. However, he backed out after paying an initial installment on the franchise fee, hoping instead to buy the struggling [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]]. Needing a credible owner with the means to front a team in the nation's biggest market, Dixon persuaded Oklahoma oil magnate [[J. Walter Duncan]] to step in. Duncan had originally been slated to own the USFL's [[Chicago Blitz|Chicago franchise]], as he'd grown up in Chicago. However, he readily agreed to shift to New York.&lt;ref name=Reeths&gt;{{cite book|title=The United States Football League, 1982-1986|last=Reeths|first=Paul|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|date=2017|isbn=1476667446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duncan took on former [[New England Patriots]] coach [[Chuck Fairbanks]] as a minority partner; Duncan knew Fairbanks from his days as head coach at the [[University of Oklahoma]]. Fairbanks also served as general manager and head coach. They initially had an uphill battle to get a lease at Giants Stadium, but were able to obtain one on condition that they brand their team as "New Jersey" rather than "New York."  They named the team the "Generals" after the large number of generals based in New Jersey during the Revolutionary War.&lt;ref name=Reeths/&gt;

The team made a big splash by signing [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning underclassman [[Herschel Walker]], a running back from the [[University of Georgia]]. While the USFL had followed the NFL's lead in banning underclassmen from playing, league officials were certain that this rule would never withstand a court challenge.  In an even more ominous development, Walker did not sign a standard player contract. Rather, he agreed to a three-year personal-services contract with Duncan.  The contract was valued at $4.2 million—more than double the USFL's salary cap of $1.8 million.  Nonetheless, the other owners knew having the incumbent Heisman winner in their fold would lend the USFL instant credibility, and allowed the contract to stand.  

Despite the signing of Walker, who rushed for 1,812 yards and 17 touchdowns, the Generals finished their inaugural season with a 6–12 record.  This was largely due to a porous defense which gave up the third-most points in the league (437).

===1984===
At 66 years old, Duncan soon tired of flying 2,000 miles from Oklahoma to New York to see his team play. He was not willing to be an absentee owner, and decided to sell to a local buyer. After the 1983 season, he found one in Trump, who had initially angled for the franchise in 1982 before backing out.&lt;ref name=Buck&gt;{{cite book|title=Football For A Buck: The Crazy Rise and Crazier Demise of the USFL|last=Pearlman|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Pearlman|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|date=2018|isbn=978-0544454385}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Trump tried to lure legendary coach [[Don Shula]] from the [[Miami Dolphins]]. Once Shula declined, the Generals hired former [[New York Jets]] head coach [[Walt Michaels]].&lt;ref name=Buck/&gt;  

The Generals responded to their poor 1983 showing with an influx of veteran NFL talent for 1984, including [[wide receiver]] [[Tom McConnaughey]], [[quarterback]] [[Brian Sipe]], [[defensive back]] [[Gary Barbaro]], and [[linebacker]]s [[Jim LeClair]] and [[Bobby Leopold]]. Both Walker and [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Maurice Carthon]] rushed for over 1,000 yards (Walker 1,339; Carthon 1,042) as the Generals went 14–4, defeating the eventual champion [[Philadelphia Stars (football)|Philadelphia Stars]] twice for that franchise's only two losses of the season. The Stars defeated the Generals 28–7 in a first round playoff game.

===1985===
The 1985 season saw the heralded signing of Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback [[Doug Flutie]] of [[Boston College]]. Despite Flutie's inexperience, the Generals traded Sipe to the [[Jacksonville Bulls]] to ensure Flutie would start.&lt;ref name=Buck/&gt; Flutie struggled at times but played well overall until he suffered a broken collarbone against the [[Memphis Showboats]] in the season's 15th game and did not play again. The 1985 Generals finished 11–7 behind Walker's pro-football record 2,411 rushing yards but lost again to the Stars (transplanted to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]) in the first round of the playoffs, 20–17.

===1986===
Almost from the moment Trump bought the Generals, he sought to use them as a vehicle to get an NFL team. To this end, he began advocating moving the USFL from a spring schedule to a fall schedule, directly opposite NFL. His long-term plans called for moving the Generals across the [[Hudson River]] to New York, which had not had a team play within its borders since the Jets moved from [[Shea Stadium]] in [[Queens]] to the Meadowlands. He intended to have the Generals play at Shea until the construction of a new 80,000-seat "Trump Stadium" in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=Buck/&gt;

In 1984, he convinced most of his fellow owners to move to a fall schedule in 1986. Trump contended that if the USFL were to hold its own against the NFL, it would eventually force a merger with the more established league—in which the owners of any USFL teams included in a merger would see their investment more than double.

The Generals acquired the assets of one of the teams displaced by the vote to move to the fall, the [[Houston Gamblers]], during the extended offseason. This was widely reported as a merger, since the Generals inherited all of the Gamblers' player contracts–including those of quarterback [[Jim Kelly]] and wide receiver [[Ricky Sanders]].  Michaels was fired, replaced with former Gamblers coach [[Jack Pardee]], who planned to bring Kelly and the Gamblers' high-powered [[run and shoot offense]] with him.  Fans immediately dubbed the Kelly-Walker led Generals as the USFL's "Dream Team." 

However, the revamped Generals never played a down. The 1986 season was cancelled after the USFL won a minimal verdict in an [[antitrust]] lawsuit against the NFL; the league folded soon afterward.

Numerous Generals players, including Flutie, Walker and center [[Kent Hull]] went on to productive NFL careers. Flutie also starred in the [[Canadian Football League]]; Hull (with Gambler quarterback Kelly) played in four [[Super Bowl]]s with the [[Buffalo Bills]], and Flutie was the last quarterback to have led the Bills to the NFL playoffs until the 2017 season.

'''Oracle Policy Automation''' (abbreviated '''OPA''') is a suite of [[software]] products for modeling and deploying [[business rules]] within enterprise applications. [[Oracle Corporation]] acquired OPA in December 2008 when it purchased Australian software company RuleBurst Holdings, then trading as Haley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/haley/index.html|title=Oracle and Haley - Strategic Acquisitions - Oracle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oracle Policy Automation was designed by [[RuleBurst]] to transform legislation and policy documents into executable business rules, particularly for the calculation of benefit entitlements and payment amounts. Although OPA was originally developed for and sold to the [[public sector]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sue Bushell |url=http://www.cio.com.au/article/142680/business_rules_boost_centrelink |title=Business Rules Boost to Centrelink |publisher=CIO |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; it can be used in other industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/eye-on-oracle/oracle-hunts-for-bargains-in-down-economy/ |title=Oracle hunts for bargains in down economy - Eye on Oracle |publisher=Itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com |date=2008-11-04 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oracle Policy Automation continues to be available as a standalone offering and an integrated rules solution for SAP and Siebel.

== Features and components ==
'''Oracle Policy Modeling''' is a Windows desktop application for transforming legislation and policy documents into executable business rules. Rules are written in [[Microsoft Word]] and [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] documents using phrases in languages such as [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/applications/policy-automation/pdf/Oracle%20Policy%20Automation%2010.0%20-%20Features%20and%20Benefits.pdf |title=Oracle Policy Automation on OTN |publisher=Oracle.com |date=2010-09-07 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rule documents can be shared amongst business and [[information technology]] stakeholders, and commentary can be added into the documents without affecting the structure of the rules themselves. Other features of Oracle Policy Modeling include integrated test case execution and debugging capabilities, and the definition of interviews for interactive rule-based assessments. Interview screen order and branching logic can be defined using visual flow diagrams.

The '''Oracle Policy Automation''' run-time comprises three technologies:
* '''OPA Web Determinations''': An interview application that uses screens, rules and flows defined in Oracle Policy Modeling to deliver [[Internet]]- and [[intranet]]-based interactive assessments. Data entered is used in combination with [[backward chaining]] to determine which screens need to be shown to the user in order to reach a decision.
* '''OPA Determinations Server''': A [[WS-I Basic Profile]] compliant [[SOAP]]-based web service that exposes decision-making endpoints for deployed policy models. By passing data to OPA Determinations Server, and receiving responses in return, enterprises can integrate rule-based decision-making with other applications and [[Business process modeling|BPM]] solutions. Examples include Oracle's [[Siebel]], or [[BPEL]]-orchestrated business processes. If insufficient data is provided to reach a decision, Oracle Determinations Server is able to explain what additional data may be required.
* '''OPA Determinations Engine''': The engine used by both OPA Web Determinations and OPA Determinations Server, it is also available as a native [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]] [[API]]. OPA Determinations Engine provides both full [[forward chaining]] and backward chaining capabilities, as well as low-level access to the interview engine.

Both OPA Web Determinations and OPA Determinations Server are supported on a wide variety of application servers, including [[Oracle WebLogic Server]], [[Microsoft IIS]], [[IBM WebSphere Application Server|IBM WebSphere AS]] and [[Apache Tomcat]].

Connectors for enterprise applications such as Oracle's Siebel and [[SAP ERP|SAP]] are also available.

== Versions ==
The product now known as Oracle Policy Automation has been sold under several different names, including Haley Office Rules and RuleBurst.

RuleBurst 7.0 was the successor to STATUTE Expert.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizrules.info/files/BIZRULES.BRE.Family.Tree.2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Although customers of STATUTE Expert were able to upgrade to the later versions, RuleBurst 7.0 was the first version of the product that has become known as Oracle Policy Automation today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oracle.com/support/library/brochure/lifetime-support-applications.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Oracle has released several versions of Oracle Policy Automation (OPA) since it was acquired:

Oracle Policy Modeling's controlled natural language approach to rule authoring has been the subject of some research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/cnl2009/ |title=CNL 2009 |publisher=Attempto.ifi.uzh.ch |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Clarify|date=March 2010}} The product was also used to help establish the viability of the Legal Knowledge Interchange Format&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estrellaproject.org/lkif-core/ |title=LKIF-Core Ontology: A Commonsense-based Legal Ontology |publisher=Estrellaproject.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; standard developed by the Estrella Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estrellaproject.org/?page_id=4 |title=Estrella » Deliverables &amp; Publications |publisher=Estrellaproject.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estrellaproject.org/doc/4.2%20HALEY.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - VOORBLAD.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acquisition and product confusion ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
RuleBurst acquired the assets of Haley Systems in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/Acquisitions/Haley/index.html|title=Oracle and Haley - Strategic Acquisitions - Oracle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the time, RuleBurst and Haley were both marketing "natural language business rules" software and were considered competitors. Prior to being acquired, Haley Systems had licensed its HaleyAuthority rules product to [[Siebel Systems]]. HaleyAuthority was made available in Siebel 8.0 under the name Siebel Business Rules. When RuleBurst acquired Haley, it adopted the better-known Haley name for both its company and product branding. HaleyAuthority then became known as Haley Expert Rules and the RuleBurst product became known as Haley Office Rules.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} When Oracle acquired RuleBurst, Oracle also began jointly marketing OPA with the Siebel CRM solution. The plurality of names has led some commentators {{Who|date=March 2010}} to incorrectly refer to Oracle Policy Automation and Haley products interchangeably as Haley or Haley Rules. However, the two products are separate and distinct offerings.

The '''Railway Companies' Association''' was a co-ordinating body for [[United Kingdom|British]] railway companies from 1867 until [[nationalisation]] in 1948. Its purpose was to protect the interests of the companies and their shareholders, chiefly against parliamentary interference. It was an early example of a [[Lobbying|lobby]] organisation.

==History==
The Association had its roots in a meeting of railway company chairmen, held at the [[Railway Clearing House]] (RCH) in March 1854, to discuss parliamentary matters of concern, but a properly constituted organisation developed only slowly. This was partly a result of the independent nature of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] railway companies and the number of company chairmen and senior
officers who were [[House of Lords|Lords]] or [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] in their own right, and partly a reflection of the gradually increasing role of government in regulating railway company actions and the need for an 'industry' response.

By 1858 a United Railway Companies' Committee (URCC) had been formed, but it foundered after three years and was only re-constituted at a meeting on 26 June 1867, held at the Westminster office of the [[Midland Railway]] Company.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; The revived body's first achievement was to promulgate a standard format for the accounts of railway companies, drawn up by the Chief Accountants of five of the major companies. This was accepted by the [[Board of Trade]] and included as a Schedule in the [[Regulation of Railways Act 1868]] (31 &amp; 32 Vict., cap. 119).&lt;ref&gt;Bonavia, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Jack, 'Regulation Acts' in Simmons, Jack and Biddle, Gordon (eds),
''The Oxford companion to British Railway history: from 1603 to the 1990s'',
Oxford, New York: OUP, 1997, {{ISBN|0-19-211697-5}}, page 418&lt;/ref&gt;

The URCC was renamed 'The Railway Companies' Association' in 1869&lt;ref&gt;Bonavia, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; or 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Its main task was to follow the progress of legislation which might affect railways, attempting to persuade MPs and Lords to vote in the '[[The railway interest|railway interest']], and giving evidence to parliamentary committees. It also promoted legislation designed to assist railway companies. This finally left the RCH free of a political role and able to concentrate on the commercial organisation of inter-company services.

Membership of the Association received a boost with the arguments over the passing of the [[Regulation of Railways Act 1873]] (36 &amp; 37 Vict., cap. 48). The perceived threats to profitability, through regulation of the rates which the 'monopolist' railways could charge, led to several moderately-large companies joining the major ones in the Association, finally giving it national coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

Chairmanship of the Association rotated amongst the Chairmen of leading railway companies. Much of the actual lobbying work of the Association devolved onto its parliamentary subcommittee, which consisted of Lords and MPs from the member companies' boards.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association had a small permanent secretariat, paid for by a precept of one or two shillings per £1,000 of the gross revenue of each participating company. The first Secretary of the Association was Kenneth Morison, who was also the first secretary of the RCH, but by 1873 the Honorary Secretary was [[Henry Oakley]] (knighted 1891), who was Secretary and then General Manager (1870-1898) of the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.159, pp.279-280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Michael, 'Oakley, Henry (1823-1914)' in Simmons, Jack and Biddle, Gordon (eds), ''The Oxford companion to British Railway history: from 1603 to the 1990s'', Oxford, New York: OUP, 1997, {{ISBN|0-19-211697-5}}, page 356&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in post at the Association for the rest of 19th century, and the Association's activities were presumably co-ordinated from Oakley's offices at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]].

In the aftermath of the [[Regulation of Railways Act 1889]] (52 &amp; 53 Vict., cap. 57) and the industrial unrest of the 1890s, including the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]]'s unilateral recognition of the new [[Trade union|trades union]] the [[National Union of Railwaymen|Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]], the ad-hoc nature of the Association came under increasing pressure, leading to a restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.186-191&lt;/ref&gt; This involved giving the secretariat a permanent base, in three rooms at 53 Parliament Street, leased from October 1900, and appointing a full-time paid secretary, the first being the rising [[barrister]] [[Guy Granet|William Guy Granet]], appointed in
November 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.191, p.321&lt;/ref&gt; Later secretaries included barristers [[W. Temple Franks]] (1905-1909) and [[Arthur Beresford Crane]] (1909-1929).&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.321&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association's role was necessarily reduced during [[World War I]] when parliamentary interest in domestic transport matters was low, railways being managed for the war effort under the provisions of the [[Regulation of the Forces Act 1871]], but it gained in importance when the newly established post-war [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]] decided to deal with the railway companies jointly through the Association.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the [[Railways Act 1921]], during passage of which the Association lobbied for better compensation terms for shareholders,&lt;ref&gt;Bonavia, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; grouped British companies into four large concerns, another restructuring of the Association took place. The parliamentary members' council was abolished, severing the direct link with parliament, and the four new general managers constituted a standing committee of the Association. Briefings of independent railway-linked Lords and MPs continued however, for example in the companies' 1938 'Square Deal' campaign for reform of freight rates' legislation in the face of road competition (which was overtaken by the onset of war in 1939)&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p.414&lt;/ref&gt; and in the run up to the [[Transport Act 1947]] which [[nationalization|nationalised]] the railways. With all railways then under a single management within the [[British Transport Commission]], the Association was wound up at this point.

==Nomenclature==
Modern commentators (Bonavia, Harris) drop the apostrophe in the name of this organisation, but Alderman includes it (when not abbreviating it to 'Railway Association'). Despite not having had opportunity to examine the Association's minutes, one feels sure that the Victorians would also have been grammatically correct and we have retained it here. The Association doesn't seem to have been referred to by its initials 'RCA'.

==Records==
The minutes of the Association were printed and distributed to the member companies, so several sets survive.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, pp.253-254&lt;/ref&gt; They are available for consultation in [[The National Archives]], together with other papers relating to the Association, and in the [[National Archives of Scotland]].

'''Richard Melbourne Hurlburt''' (born April 25, 1950) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician. He represented the electoral district of [[Yarmouth (provincial electoral district)|Yarmouth]] in the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]] from 1999 to 2010.

==Biography==
In June 1999, he barely escaped with his life when his light plane crashed into a lake in Yarmouth County. He said he would have drowned if it had not been for a passenger who dragged him from the wreckage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngnews.ca/Business/2010-02-10/article-799022/QuickSketch-of-Nova-Scotia-Conservative-Richard-Hurlburt/1|title=QuickSketch of Nova Scotia Conservative Richard Hurlburt|publisher=The News|date=February 10, 2010|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurlburt was a Yarmouth County municipal councillor for 11 years and was warden of Yarmouth County for 5 years.

He was a member of the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia|Progressive Conservatives]]. Until the cabinet of Premier [[Darrell Dexter]] was sworn in on June 19, 2009, Hurlburt served as Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations.

===Expenses scandal===
Hurlburt resigned from the legislature on February 9, 2010, following [[Nova Scotia Parliamentary Expenses Scandal|revelations]] that he had spent his constituency allowance on a generator and a 40" television, which together cost over $11,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/hurlburt-resigns-amid-spending-flap-1.912084|title=Hurlburt resigns amid spending flap|publisher=CBC News|date=February 9, 2010|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sought sanctuary in Florida citing "severe depression" where he was visited by his son and his lawyer, Martin Pink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.ca/content/news-archive|title=Hurlburt reported close to collapse in Florida|publisher=Shelburne County Today|date=February 18, 2010|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2011, it was announced that Hurlburt was among four people facing criminal charges in connection with the RCMP investigation into 2010s MLA expense scandal. Hurlburt was charged with fraud exceeding $5,000, breach of trust by a public officer, and 3 counts of uttering a forged document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/mla-spending-probe-in-n-s-gets-4-charged-1.998239|title=MLA spending probe in N.S. gets 4 charged|publisher=CBC News|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2012, Hurlburt's lawyer said his client would plead guilty to fraud and breach of trust. In exchange, three charges of uttering forged documents were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-MLA Hurlburt will plead guilty over expense scandal|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/ex-mla-hurlburt-will-plead-guilty-over-expense-scandal-1.1221970|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=May 7, 2018|date=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 12, 2012, Hurlburt pleaded guilty to fraud and breach of trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hurlburt pleads guilty in N.S. spending scandal|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/hurlburt-pleads-guilty-in-n-s-spending-scandal-1.1187508|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=May 7, 2018|date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 27, 2012, Hurlburt was sentenced to 12 months of house arrest, followed by 12 months of probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former N.S. cabinet minister gets house arrest|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/former-n-s-cabinet-minister-gets-house-arrest-1.1257996|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=May 7, 2018|date=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Software development process}}

'''Scrumban''' is an [[Agile software development|Agile]] management methodology describing hybrids of [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] and [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]] and was originally designed as a way to transition from [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] to [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]]. Today, Scrumban is a management framework that emerges when teams employ Scrum as their chosen way of working and use the Kanban Method as a lens through which to view, understand and continuously improve how they work.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ladas|first1=Corey|title=Scrum-ban|website=Lean Software Engineering|url=http://leansoftwareengineering.com/ksse/scrum-ban/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reddy|first1=Ajay|title=Scrumban [R]Evolution- Get the most out of Agile, Scrum and Lean Kanban |website=Pearson|url=http://www.informit.com/store/scrumban-revolution-getting-the-most-out-of-agile-scrum-9780134086217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As the [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]] method was becoming more popular {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}, Scrumban was developed  &lt;ref&gt; Ladas, Corey (January 2009). Scrumban: Essays on Kanban Systems for Lean Software Development. Modus Cooperandi Press. {{ISBN|978-0578002149}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an attempt to make it easier for existing [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] teams to begin exploring [[Lean software development|Lean]] and [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]] concepts {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

The first article on Scrumban, which uses the spelling "Scrum-ban", describes several levels to transition from [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] to [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fundamentally, Scrumban is a management framework that emerges when teams employ Scrum as their chosen way of working and use the Kanban Method as a lens through which to view, understand and continuously improve how they work.

Scrumban is distinct from Scrum in the way it emphasizes certain principles and practices that are substantially different from Scrum's traditional foundation. Among these are:

* recognizing the important role of organizational management (self-organization remains an objective but within the context of specific boundaries)
* allowing for specialized teams and functions
* applying explicit policies around ways of working
* applying the laws of flow and queuing theory
* deliberate economic prioritization&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Scrumban is distinct from the Kanban Method in that it:

* prescribes an underlying software development process framework (Scrum) as its core
* is organized around teams
* recognizes the value of time-boxed iterations when appropriate
* formalizes continuous improvement techniques within specific ceremonies&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Perhaps most importantly, the principles and practices embedded within Scrumban are not unique to the software development process. They can be easily applied in many different contexts, providing a common language and shared experience across interrelated business functions. This, in turn, enhances the kind of organizational alignment that is an essential characteristic of success.

==A Framework for [R]Evolution==
{{Copypaste|section|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2431512&amp;WT.mc_id=Author_Reddy_Scrumban|date=October 2017}}
When Corey Ladas introduced the world to Scrumban in his seminal book of that name,&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book
  | title =Scrumban: Essays on Kanban Systems for Lean Software Development
  | last =Ladas
  | first =Corey 
  | publisher = Modus Cooperandi Press
  |date=January 2009 
  |isbn = 978-0578002149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he defined it as a transition method for moving software development teams from Scrum to a “more evolved” software development framework. In actual practice, however, Scrumban has itself evolved to become a family of principles and practices that create complementary capabilities unique from both Scrum and the Kanban Method. These capabilities have led to three distinct manifestations:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* As a framework that helps teams and organizations effectively adopt Scrum as a development methodology.
* As a framework that helps teams and organizations overcome a variety of common challenges scaling Scrum across the Enterprise.
* As a framework that helps teams and organizations develop their own set of Scrum-based processes and practices that work best for them—not to accommodate inadequacies and dysfunctions Scrum exposed, but to resolve them in a manner that was most effective for their unique environment.

==The Method==
In Scrumban, the teamwork is organized in small iterations and monitored with the help of a visual board, similar to Scrum and [[kanban board]]s. To illustrate each stage of work, teams working in the same space often use post-it notes or a large whiteboard. In the case of decentralized teams, visual management software such as [[Assembla]], [[Targetprocess]], [[Eylean Board]], [[Jira (software)|JIRA]], [[Mingle]] or [[Agilo for Trac]] are often used.[http://www.infoq.com/articles/book-review-scrumban-revolution]  Planning meetings are held to determine what user stories to complete in the next iteration. The user stories are then added to the board and the team completes them, the team working on a few user stories at a time as practical (the work-in-progress, or WIP, limit). To keep iterations short, WIP limits are thus used, and a planning trigger is set in place for the team to know when to plan next - when WIP falls below a predetermined level. There are no predefined roles in Scrumban; the team keeps the roles they already have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vasiliauskas|first1=Vidas|title=Scrumban - mixing agile and lean|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaNHFsFz7Yw|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iterations===
Work iterations in Scrumban are kept short. This ensures that a team can easily adapt and change their course of action to a quickly changing environment. The length of the iteration is measured in weeks. The ideal length of an iteration depends on the work process of each team, and it is recommended not to have iterations exceeding two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Don|first1=Wells|title=Iterative Planning|url=http://www.agile-process.org/iterative.html|website=Agile Process|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Velocity (a measure of productivity) is often used by the team to assess issues and trends in its throughput, in order to support continuous improvement.

===On-demand planning===
The planning in Scrumban is based on demand and occurs only when the planning trigger goes off. The planning trigger is associated with the number of tasks left in the "To Do" section of the board - when it goes down to a certain number, the planning event is held. The number of tasks that should trigger a planning event is not predefined. It depends on a team's velocity (how quickly it can finish the remaining tasks) and on the time required to plan the next iteration. The tasks planned for the next iteration are added to the "To Do" section of the board.

===Prioritization===
It is recommended to prioritize tasks during the planning event. This means the tasks are added to the board with marked priorities. It helps the team members to know which tasks should be completed first and which can be completed later. The prioritization can be done by adding numbers to the tasks or by adding an additional priority column, where the most important tasks are put at the top and the less important tasks below.

===Bucket size planning===
[[File:Bucket size planning.jpg|framed|right]]
Bucket size planning brings the possibility of long-term planning to Scrumban. It is based on the system of three buckets that the work items need to go through before making it on the Scrumban board. The three buckets represent three different stages of the plan and are usually called 1-year, 6-month and 3-month buckets. The 1-year bucket is dedicated for long-term goals that the company has, like penetrating a new market, releasing new product, etc. When the company decides to move forward with a plan, it is moved to the 6-month bucket, where the main requirements of this plan are crystallized. When a company is ready to start implementing the plan, the requirements are moved into the 3-month bucket and divided into clear tasks to be completed by the project team. It is from this bucket that the team draws tasks during their on-demand planning meeting and starts working on the tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miseviciute|first1=D.|title=Scrumban: on demand vs. long-term planning|url=http://www.eylean.com/blog/2014/11/scrumban-on-demand-vs-long-term-planning/|website=Eylean Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The board===
[[File:Simple-kanban-board-.jpg|thumb|400px|right|A simple kanban board]]The basic Scrumban board is composed out of three columns: To Do, Doing and Done. After the planning meeting, the tasks are added to the To Do column, when a team member is ready to work on a task, he/she moves it to the Doing column and when he/she completes it, he/she moves it to the Done column. The Scrumban board visually represents the progress of the team. The task board columns are adapted and expanded based on the team's work progress. The most common add-ons include priority columns in the To Do section and columns like Design, Manufacturing, Testing in the Doing section.

'''WIP limits -- '''
To ensure that the team is working effectively, Scrumban methodology states that a team member should be working on no more than one task at a time. To make sure this rule is followed Scrumban uses WIP (work in progress) limit. This limit is visualized on top of the Doing section of the board (also could be on each column of that section) and means that only that number of tasks can be in the corresponding column at one time. A WIP limit usually is equal to the number of people in the team but could be expanded based on the specifics of the team's work.

'''To Do limits --'''
In order to have more productive planning meetings, the number of tasks in the To Do section can be limited as well. The same as with WIP limits, it is written at the top of the To Do section or on top of the corresponding columns and limits the number of tasks in the To Do section or specific columns.

===The team===
Scrumban does not require any specific number of team members or team roles. The roles a team has prior to adopting Scrumban are kept when implementing Scrumban. They are reinforced by team members having to choose the tasks to complete themselves. The team roles in Scrumban are more specialized and less cross-functional than what is expected in scrum teams.

===Pull principle===
In Scrumban tasks are not assigned to the team members by the team leader or project manager. Each team member chooses which task from the To Do section they are going to complete next. This guarantees a smooth process flow, where all the team members are equally busy at all times.

===Feature freeze===
Feature freeze is used in Scrumban when the project deadline is approaching. It means that only the features that the team already has for development can still be worked on and no additional features can be added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feature Freeze|url=https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/FeatureFreeze|website=OpenStack|publisher=OpenStack|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triage===
Triage usually happens right after feature freeze. With an approaching project deadline, the project manager decides which of the in-development features will be completed and which will stay unfinished. This guarantees that the team can focus on finishing important features before the project deadline and forget the less important ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Software Triage|url=http://www.stickyminds.com/article/software-triage|website=Sticky Minds|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
* '''Bucket size planning''' long-term planning approach in Scrumban, which is based on moving the plans through a few steps.
* '''Lead and cycle time''' the time that is taken from task creation or beginning work on a task to its completion.
* '''On demand planning''' planning technique that is executed only when there is a need for new tasks on the board.

==Tooling==
Like other methods, Scrumban can be implemented with a help of various tools. The most basic Scrumban implementation is a physical whiteboard with sticky notes. [[Project management software|Electronic solutions]], similar to scrum and kanban electronic boards are available as well. They offer a full automation of the board, where it only has to be updated by the team members. Electronic boards often also provide automatic reports, the possibility of attachments and discussions on tasks, time tracking, as well as integrations with other commonly used project management software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scrumban|url=http://www.eylean.com/scrum#Scrum-ban|website=Eylean Board|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5805">The '''Senior Community Service Employment Program''' ('''SCSEP''') is a program of the [[United States Department of Labor]], its [[Employment and Training Administration]], to help more senior citizens get back into or remain active in the labor workforce. It is a community service and work-based training program.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Labor, ETA, [http://www.doleta.gov/seniors/html_docs/AboutSCSEP.cfm "About SCSEP"]&lt;/ref&gt; It does this through job skill training and employment assistance with an emphasis on getting a ready job with a suitable and cooperating company or organisation. In such a setting, the worker is paid the [[Minimum wage in the United States|United States minimum wage]], or the highest of Federal, State or local minimum wage, or the prevailing wage, for an average of 20 hours per week, and experiences on-the-job learning and newly acquired skills use. The intention is that through these community jobs, the older worker will gain a permanent job, not subsidized by federal government funds.

People who are 55 or older can obtain job training and job search services from SCSEP. In each area of the country, SCSEP services are accessed through local organizations. These are usually nonprofits, but sometimes a state agency will administer the program.

== Eligibility guidelines ==
The participant must be at least 55 years of age and from a family receiving regular cash welfare payments or with an annual family income of no more than 25% over the [[Poverty in the United States|Federal poverty level]] as defined by the [[United States Census Bureau]]. There are certain exclusions in the income calculation, such as [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] (SSDI).&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Labor, ETA, [http://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/TEGL/TEGL12-06_508.pdf "Training and Employment Guidance Letter No. 12-06], December 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrollment priority is given to persons over age 60, veterans, and qualified spouses of veterans. Preference is given to minority, limited English-speaking, and Indian eligible individuals. Preference is also given to eligible individuals who have the greatest economic need.

== History ==
SCSEP was authorised by the [[United States Congress]] in Title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965 &lt;ref&gt;[[United States Code]], [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3056- US Code Section 42 , Chapter 35, Subchapter IX, § 3056] - Older American Community Service Employment Program&lt;/ref&gt; and its later amendments &lt;ref&gt;United States Public Law, [http://www.doleta.gov/Seniors/other_docs/owp-106-501.pdf Amended Public Law for Title V] Public Law 106–501—NOV. 13, 2000 114 STAT. 2267, Title V—Amendment to Title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965, Section 501.&lt;/ref&gt; to provide subsidized, part-time, community [[Public service|service]] work based training for low-income persons age 55 or older who have poor employment prospects. The program has evolved significantly in the last 50 years.  The program is administered by nonprofit organizations and local government agencies.

== Controversy ==
Experience Works, Inc., was historically the largest provider of SCSEP services.  In 2015, the grantee was cited for $1.6 million dollars in questioned costs by the Department of Labor. The report details the use of unrestricted and accrued annual leave to cover a $1.6 million grant overspend, which $1.4 million was used to pay participant wages and fringe benefits, the misuse of federal funds to cover activities including first-class travel, pet hotels, fruit bouquets, personal loans to the CEO, and frequent credit card use on entertainment and prohibited lobbying. The number now totals approximately $2 million in questioned expenses.   &lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Department of Labor, Monitoring Report, December 18, 2015]]. [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4wFqjuHcI_1X1FtMmpEUnEwRHM]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a follow up report critical of current management for not taking any corrective actions to restore funds.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Department of Labor, Report to Sally A. Boofer, 2016]]. [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4wFqjuHcI_1cFZaTldJTnc3OW8]&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the prior management's actions, the U.S. Department of Labor has revamped the funding for SCSEP and the Inspector General has expanded the investigation into the activities of the previous management.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration]]. [https://www.doleta.gov/grants/pdf/FOA-ETA-16-04-A.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal investigation is aided by a whistleblower and other former employees. In September, 2016 the Inspector General issued a preliminary report describing the organization as financial insolvent and took steps to curtail and eliminate federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Office of Inspector General, September 30, 2016]]  [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4wFqjuHcI_1UlVSdkRGVGdCbUU]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, more than 100 employees were terminated as a result of the funding reduction and were paid only part of their accrued leave.

== Funding ==
SCSEP has received stable funding of $434,371,000 during the last several years.  The Trump administration has called for the elimination of the program, which is meeting some resistance in Congress.

The most recent budget proposal from the White House would eliminate the program entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/documents/general/budget/2016/CBJ-2016-V1-06.pdf U.S. Department of Labor]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thinking Strategically: The Competitive Edge in Business, Politics, and Everyday Life''''' is a non-fiction book by Indian-American economist [[Avinash Dixit]] and [[Barry Nalebuff]], a professor of economics and management at [[Yale School of Management]]. The text was initially published by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] on February 1, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393029239|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|title=Thinking Strategically: The Competitive Edge in Business, Politics, and Everyday Life|accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book discusses issues of strategic behaviour, decision making, and [[game theory]]. The authors present the main concepts, such as [[backward induction]], [[auction theory]], [[Nash equilibrium]], noncooperative bargaining, to a general audience. Each concept is illustrated by examples from common life, business, sports, politics, etc.—as applying game theory to real life may be the best way of crystallizing the best options available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2138835?uid=3738936&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21106298406241|publisher=[[jstor.org]]|title=Thinking Strategically: The Competitive Edge in Business, Politics, and Everyday Life|accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{quote|Today our writers and critics nominate the books they have enjoyed reading most over the last twelve months. No rules were imposed but, as you will see, all have been encouraged to be adventurous and broaden their interests away from their usual subjects

''Thinking Strategically'' by Avinash Dixit &amp; Barry Nalebuff (W W Norton) offers essential training in making choices and weighing possibilities not only in business but in daily life. Reading it is a trip to the gym for the reasoning faculties. It presents game theory and business strategy as understandable, usable and everyday tools for living with others. Its examples of tactics in action range from King Lear to Maradonna. And the case studies make great bit-reading in queues or waiting-rooms. I also much enjoyed Howard Rheingold's ''Virtual Reality'' (Secker &amp; Warburg), which describes the computer-created world waiting around the corner of the century, and Simon Schama's ''Dead Certainties'' (Granta), which sent a bright spark between history and fiction: illuminating.}}

'''Trendrr''' is a New York-based digital and social media business intelligence platform that was acquired by [[Twitter]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adageindia.in/digital/twitter-buys-trendrr-to-track-social-conversations-across-media/articleshow/45794836.cms|title=Ad Age Homepage - Ad Age|website=www.adageindia.in|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adageindia.in/digital/twitter-buys-trendrr-to-track-social-conversations-across-media/articleshow/45794836.cms|title=Ad Age Homepage - Ad Age|website=www.adageindia.in|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://marketingland.com/twitter-buys-trendrr-to-strengthen-social-tv-measurement-57471|title=Twitter Buys Trendrr To Strengthen Social TV Measurement - Marketing Land|date=2013-08-28|work=Marketing Land|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Wiredset]], a digital marketing agency, created the first version of Trendrr called Infofilter in 2006. Infofilter pulled time-series data and pushed it into graphs and charts, without the interactive features such as mash-ups and scratch pad. The reporting function was manual, and access to the platform was deemed private.

As the demand for the platform expanded beyond specific client needs, Infofilter evolved into Trendrr in April 2007.

June 2009 saw the launch of Trendrr Pro, marking Trendrr's shift from a free service to a [[freemium]] model.&lt;ref name="Mashable2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2009/06/29/trendrr-freemium/|title=Trend Spotting Service Trendrr Switches to Freemium Model|last=Schroeder|first=Stan|publisher=Mashable|date=June 29, 2009|accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to  the features included in the free version, Trendrr Pro allows users to track a greater number of data sets, receive unlimited alerts, and create custom reports.&lt;ref name=RWW/&gt; Users can also import their own data via Trendrr's [[API]].

Trendrr announced Curatorr as the latest addition to the Trendrr suite in February 2010.  Curatorr is a real time dashboard that enables users to identify conversation around a topic. Users can search real-time Twitter conversation, filter the relevant conversation, and then publish the curated stream to television, phone, and internet.&lt;ref name="RWW2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/curatorr_a_twitter_tool_for_media_companies.php |title=Curatorr: A Twitter Tool for Media Companies |publisher=Readwriteweb.com |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2010, Curatorr was used by MTV to filter and publish tweets during a live broadcast of the [[Hope for Haiti]] concert.&lt;ref name=RWW2/&gt;

==Biography==

===Personal life===
Tufele Liamatua was born in American Samoa. His 70th birthday gala was held on Saturday, September 4, 2010, at the Gov. H. Lee Auditorium.&lt;ref name=samoanews2&gt;{{cite news|first=|last= |title=Friends and family gather to fete HTC Tufele Li’amatua  |url=http://samoanews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=18610&amp;edition=1283853600&amp;newssection=LocalNews |work=[[Samoa News]] |publisher= |date=2010-09-07|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Tofiga, is a longtime [[nurse]] at LBJ Medical Center.&lt;ref name=tapuitea3&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Governor appoints Tufele Li’amatua to hospital board of directors, page 5 |url=http://americansamoa.gov/tapuitea/2008/Tapuitea080502.pdf |work=[[Tapuitea]] Volume III, No. 18 |publisher= |date=2008-05-09|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lieutenant Governor===
U.S. Rep. [[Phillip Burton]] of [[California]] introduced a Bill on June 10, 1976, in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] to allow for the popular election of the Governor and Lt. Governor, rather than appointment by the Interior Secretary.&lt;ref name=scalendar/&gt; The Bill passed the House by a 377–1 majority.&lt;ref name=scalendar/&gt; American Samoa Governor [[Hyrum Rex Lee]] approved Public Law 15-23 on May 16, 1977, which called on the [[U.S. Secretary of the Interior]] to allow the [[direct election]] of the Governor and Lt. Governor.&lt;ref name=scalendar/&gt; On September 13, 1977, the Department of the Interior issued Order No. 3009 which provided a "Provision for Elected Governor and Lieutenant Governor, and Creation of Office of Government Comptroller".&lt;ref name=scalendar/&gt; This paved the way for American Samoa's first popular gubernatorial election in November 1977.

[[Peter Tali Coleman]], who had previously served as appointed Governor during the 1950s, and his [[running mate]], Tufele Liamatua, won the 1977 [[gubernatorial election]] on November 1, 1977, becoming the first [[directly elected]] Governor and Lt. Governor of American Samoa, respectively.&lt;ref name=scalendar&gt;{{cite web |first=Sam |last=Sorensen |title=The Samoan Historical Calendar 1606-2008 |page=266 |url=http://americansamoa.gov/sites/default/files/governors/samhist_forweb.pdf |publisher=Office of the Governor American Samoa Government |year=2008 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liamatua was inaugurated as Lieutenant Governor of [[American Samoa]] on January 3, 1978.&lt;ref name=scalendar2&gt;{{cite web |first=Sam |last=Sorensen |title=The Samoan Historical Calendar 1606-2008 |page=6 |url=http://americansamoa.gov/sites/default/files/governors/samhist_forweb.pdf |publisher=Office of the Governor American Samoa Government |year=2008 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman and Liamatua successfully campaigned for a second full term in office in the 1980 gubernatorial election. Liamatua left office on January 3, 1985, and was succeeded by [[Eni Faleomavaega]].

===Public career===
Liamatua later served as the Governor of [[Manu'a|Manu'a District]].&lt;ref name=samoanews/&gt;&lt;ref name=tapuitea&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=PC Tufele Li’amatua confirmed as newest LBJ board member, page 4 |url=http://americansamoa.gov/tapuitea/2008/Tapuitea080509.pdf |work=[[Tapuitea]] Volume III, No. 19 |publisher= |date=2008-05-09|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also held the position of [[police commissioner]] at one point.&lt;ref name=tapuitea/&gt;

Liamatua was appointed as the chairman of the Future Political Status Study Commission in 2006. [[American Samoa Senate|American Samoan Senator]] [[Tuaolo Fruean]] was appointed the Vice Chairman of the commission. The commission was created to study the potential political status of American Samoa, which is currently classified as an [[unincorporated territory of the United States]]. Liamatua asked for an extended deadline for the commission's findings.&lt;ref name=rnzi&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Tufele Liamatua to head American Samoa’s status study commission |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=24508|work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |publisher= |date=2006-06-02|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liamatua called for full [[autonomy]] for American Samoa in November 2006, citing a list of political weaknesses which needed to be addressed by the Future Political Status Study Commission. Liamatua noted concerns that while the [[Governor of American Samoa]] is elected by the people, he or she can be removed by the [[U.S. Secretary of the Interior]] at any time. Liamatua also cited three other examples in his argument for complete autonomy for American Samoa. He reiterated that the [[United Nations]] lists American Samoa as a [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|non-self governing territory]]. He also cited American Samoa's application to join the [[Pacific Islands Forum]] as an associate member by Governor [[Togiola Tulafono]], which the [[U.S. State Department]] wanted to rescind because the application was not handled by the federal government. Finally, Laimatua criticized interference by the [[U.S. National Park Service]] on a deal negotiated by Governor Tulafono to construct a [[McDonald's]] restaurant on [[Utulei, American Samoa|Utulei Beach]].&lt;ref name=rnzi2&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Call for complete autonomy for American Samoa |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=28561|work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |publisher= |date=2006-11-27|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Governor Tulafono nominated Liamatua to the [[board of directors]] of the LBJ Medical Center.&lt;ref name=tapuitea/&gt; He was confirmed by the [[American Samoa Senate]] in a 14-2 vote.&lt;ref name=tapuitea/&gt; Liamatua was elected to the [[American Samoa House of Representatives]] in [[American Samoan general election, 2006|2006]], representing Su'a Number One District.&lt;ref name=rnzi3&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Bluesky Comms in American Samoa has new officer |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=44783|work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |publisher= |date=2009-02-12|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the chairman of the House retirement and communications committees.&lt;ref name=rnzi3/&gt;

===Secretary of Samoan Affairs===
Governor Togiola Tulafono appointed Liamatua as [[Secretary of Samoan Affairs]] on January 7, 2009. He succeeded outgoing Secretary [[Mauga Tasi Asuega]]. Liamatua simultaneously became the head of the Department of Local Government upon his appointment to the office. Under American Samoan law, the Secretary of Samoan Affairs is selected and appointed by the Governor from the territory's senior [[Fa'amatai|matai]], or chiefs. The selection of the Samoan Affairs Secretary is the sole discretion of the Governor and does not need the approval of the [[American Samoa Fono]].&lt;ref name=samoanews/&gt;

One of Liamatua's first duties as Samoan Affairs Secretary was to officiate the [[Samoa 'ava ceremony|ava faatupu]], which was held on January 9, 2009, for the second inauguration of Gov. Tulafono and Lt. Governor [[Ipulasi Aitofele Sunia]].&lt;ref name=samoanews/&gt; Secretary Liamatua is also charged with welcoming visiting dignitaries, including [[Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] on her brief visit to American Samoa in November 2010.&lt;ref name=talanei&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Here For Nearly Two Hours |url=http://www.talanei.com/viewNews.php?storyID=2044 |work=[[Talanei.com]] |publisher= |date=2010-11-08|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tapuitea2&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Governor and local delegation welcome US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton |url=http://americansamoa.gov/tapuitea/2010/Tapuitea101109.pdf |work=[[Tapuitea]] Volume V, No. 45 |publisher= |date=2010-11-09|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, 2010, Secretary Liamatua called on the American Samoan community to help prevent the spread of [[HIV]] and [[AIDs]] in a [[keynote]] speech presented in the run-up to [[World AIDS Day]] at a Sunday church service.&lt;ref name=rnzi4&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=American Samoa govt calls on local to prevent spread of HIV/AIDs |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=57409|work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |publisher= |date=2010-12-01|accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3942">{{Insolvency}}
An '''undervalue transaction''' is a transaction entered into by a [[company (law)|company]]&lt;ref&gt;Some legal systems also apply undervalue transactions to insolvent individuals&lt;/ref&gt; who subsequently goes into [[bankruptcy]] which the court orders be set aside, usually upon the application of a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] for the benefit of the debtor's creditors.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, section 238 of the Insolvency Act 1986 in the [[United Kingdom]], and section 558FB of the [[Corporations Act 2001]] in [[Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Under [[Australian insolvency law]] they are referred to as '''uncommercial transactions'''.

Under ordinary principles of [[contract law]], the courts will not generally look into the adequacy of the [[consideration]] provided by either side.  However, if a company is in real peril of going into bankruptcy, many legal systems provide a mechanism that transactions which are seriously commercially disadvantageous to the company can be unwound, so as to prevent prejudice to the creditors of the company.

Normally, for a transaction to be set aside as an undervalue transaction, the liquidator or equivalent must demonstrate that:
#the consideration received by the company in the transaction, in money or money's worth is significantly less than the value, in money or money's worth, provided by the company;
#the transaction was entered into during the "vulnerability period"; and
#at the time of the transaction, the company was unable to pay its debts as they fell due, or became unable to pay its debts as they fell due as a result of the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;This is the ''cash-flow'' test of insolvency.  Some jurisdictions (although not many) apply the ''balance-sheet'' test of insolvency to undervalue transactions, either as an alternative to the cash-flow test, or in addition to it.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vulnerability period is the period of time immediately prior to the company going into bankruptcy.  The length of the vulnerability period varies between countries, and some countries apply different vulnerability periods in different circumstances.  For example, in the United Kingdom, the vulnerability period is either:
#two years, if the person with whom the company entered into the transaction with is a "connected person",&lt;ref&gt;Connected person is usually defined under the relevant legislation, e.g. in the United Kingdom, see section 249 of the Insolvency Act, and which is drafted so as to try and catch all insiders and affiliates, other than employees&lt;/ref&gt; or
#6 months, in all other cases.
The period is calculated by reference to the period of time immediately preceding the company going into liquidation or administration.

The effect of a successful application to have a transaction declared as an undervalue transaction varies.  Inevitably the other party to the transaction who received the benefit has to return the benefit (or account for it) it to the liquidator.  In some countries the assets are treated in the normal way, and may be taken by any [[secured creditor]]s who have a [[security interest]] which catches the assets (characteristically, a [[floating charge]]).&lt;ref&gt;See ''Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd'' (1997) BCC 282, now superseded by legislation.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some countries have "ring-fenced" recoveries of unfair preferences so that they are made available to the pool of assets for [[unsecured creditor]]s.

Many jurisdictions which have prohibitions on undervalue transactions also provide for an exception in the case of transactions entered into in the [[ordinary course of business]] where the [[Board of directors|directors]] are of a view that it is for the benefit of the company, and such transactions are usually either validated or presumed to be validated.

An '''unsecured creditor''' is a [[creditor]] other than a [[preferential creditor]] that does not have the benefit of any [[security interest]]s in the assets of the [[debtor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredcreditor.asp|title=Definition: unsecured creditor|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of the [[bankruptcy]] of the debtor, the unsecured creditors usually obtain a ''[[pari passu]]'' distribution out of the assets of the insolvent company on a liquidation in accordance with the size of their debt after the [[secured creditor]]s have enforced their [[security interest|security]] and the preferential creditors have exhausted their claims.

Although in a [[liquidate|liquidation]] the unsecured creditors will usually realize the smallest proportion of their claims, in some legal systems, unsecured creditors who are also indebted to the insolvent debtor can (and in some jurisdictions, must) [[set-off (law)|set off]] the debts, putting the unsecured creditor with a matured liability to the debtor in a pre-preferential position.

'''Walter Goodall''' (1706? – 1766) was a Scottish historical writer, born in [[Banffshire]], and educated at [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], [[University of Aberdeen]].  Later he became assistant librarian to the [[Advocates' Library]] in [[Edinburgh]].

In 1754 Goodall published an ''Examination of the Letters said to have been written by Mary Queen of Scots'' on [[Casket letters]]. Printing the letters, he contested their authenticity. He also edited [[John of Fordun]]'s ''[[Scotichronicon]]'' (1759).

==Life==
He was the eldest son of John Goodall, a farmer in Banffshire. He was educated at King's College, Old Aberdeen, which he entered in 1723, but left without taking a degree. In 1730 he obtained employment in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, and in 1735 became sub-librarian.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Goodall, Walter (1706?-1766)|volume=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodall died in poverty 28 July 1766.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Walter Goodall aided the principal librarian [[Thomas Ruddiman]] in the compilation of the catalogue of the Advocates' Library, printed in 1742.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1753 Goodall edited a new issue of the garbled ''Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland'', originally published by [[David Crawford (historian)|David Crawford]]. His interest in the partisan ''Memoirs'' was connected with the favourable representation they contained of the career of Queen Mary. He planned to write her life, and published in 1754, in two volumes, an ''Examination of the Letters said to be written by Mary Queen of Scots to James, Earl of Bothwell''. This work presaged the apologist period of the literature relating to the queen.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1754 also, Goodall published an edition, with emendations, of [[Scot of Scotstarvet]]'s ''Staggering State of Scots Statesmen'', and an edition of [[James Balfour, Lord Pittendreich]]'s ''Practicks'', with preface and life. He assisted [[Robert Keith (historian)|Robert Keith]] in the preparation of his ''New Catalogue of Scottish Bishops'', for which he supplied the preliminary account of the [[Culdees]]. He denied that the [[Scotia]] of the early writers was Ireland (not Scotland), and that those first termed [[Scoti]] were really emigrants from Ireland; he affirmed that Ireland's other ancient name [[Ierne (disambiguation)|Ierne]] belonged also to Scotland. The ''glacialis Ierne'', which, according to [[Claudian]], wept for her slain Scots, was in his opinion the valley of [[Strathearn]], the seat of an ancient Celtic earldom.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Goodall published in 1759 an edition of Fordun's ''Scotichronicon'', with a Latin introduction on the antiquities of Scotland, and a dissertation on the marriage of [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]]. An English translation of the introduction appeared separately in 1769.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;
