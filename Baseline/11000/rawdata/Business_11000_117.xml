The ways in which [[glass]] was exchanged throughout ancient times is intimately related to its production and is a stepping stone to learning about the economies and interactions of ancient societies.  Because of its nature it can be shaped into a variety of forms and as such is found in different archaeological contexts (window panes, jewellery, tableware...). This is important because it can inform on how different industries of sections of societies related to each other – both within a cultural region or with foreign societies.

Glass trade is mainly studied by compositional analysis of glass objects creating groups with specific chemical compositions that hopefully allow to differentiate between production centres (both geographically and chronologically). Complications arise from the fact that for long periods of time glass was made following very similar recipes and as such the major elements found do not vary significantly. It is made by a mixture of raw materials which means that different sources of each raw material even for the same production centre further complicate the situation. That it is a material that lends itself well to recycling can only add to this. However, as scientific techniques improve it is becoming increasingly possible to discern some compositional groups, together with other archaeological and textual evidence a picture of glass technology, industry and exchange is starting to emerge.

== Mesopotamia and Eastern Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age ==
{{see also|History of glass|Hellenistic glass}}
Glass beads are known from the 3rd millennium BC but it is only in the late 2nd millennium that glass finds start occurring more frequently, primarily in Egypt and Mesopotamia.  This is not to say that it was a widespread commodity, quite the contrary.  It was a material for high-status objects with archaeological evidence for the Late Bronze Age (LBA) also showing an almost exclusive distribution of glass finds at palace complexes such as that found in the city of Amarna – Egypt.  Texts listing offerings to Egyptian temples would start with gold and silver, followed by precious stones (lapis lazuli) and then bronze, copper and other not so precious stones with glass mentioned together with the lapis lazuli.  ''In this period it was rare and precious and its use largely restricted to the elite.'' &lt;ref&gt;Shortland 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest glass ingot was discovered in the 1300 B.C. Egyptian [[Uluburun]] shipwreck off the coast of Turkey &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/travel/12-amazing-sunken-treasure-discoveries-20130816?pageno=13|title=Sunken Treasures: The World's Most Valuable Shipwreck Discoveries|author= Liz Burlingame| date=Aug 23, 2013|publisher=The Weather Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of raw glass occurred at primary workshops of which only 3 are known, all in Egypt:  [[Amarna]], [[Pi-Ramesses]] and [[Malkata]].&lt;ref name="Walton et al 2009"&gt;Walton et al 2009&lt;/ref&gt; At the first two sites cylindrical ceramic vessels with vitrified remains have been identified as glass crucibles&lt;ref&gt;Rehren &amp; Push 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson et al 1997&lt;/ref&gt; where the raw materials (quartz pebbles and plant ash) would be melted together with a colourant. The two sites seem to show a specialisation in colour, with blue glass, via the addition of cobalt, being produced at [[Amarna]] and red, through copper, at [[Pi-Ramesses]]. The resulting coloured glass would then be fashioned into actual objects at secondary workshops – far more common in the archaeological record. It seems certain that glass making was not exclusive to Egypt (in fact current scholarly opinion resides with the industry having originally been imported into the country) as there are Mesopotamian cuneiform texts which detail the recipes for the making of glass. Further supporting this hypothesis are the [[Amarna Letters]], a contemporaneous diplomatic correspondence detailing the demand and gift giving from vassal princes in Syro-Palestine to the Egyptian King, in these the most asked for item is glass.

The evidence then points to two regions that were making and exchanging glass. It seems logical to believe that at an initial stage it was glass objects, as opposed to raw glass, that were exchanged. The major element composition of glass finds from Mesopotamia and Egypt is indistinguishable with as much variation found within a specific assemblage than between different sites. This is indicative of the same recipe being used in both regions. As analytical techniques develop the presence of trace elements can be more accurately determined and it has been found that glass is compositionally identical within each region, but it is possible to discriminate between them.&lt;ref&gt;Shortland et al 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  This could be a huge step in uncovering trade patterns, however ''at present no Egyptian glass has been found in Mesopotamia, nor have any Mesopotamian glasses been found in Egypt''.&lt;ref name="Walton et al 2009"/&gt;

Across the sea, Mycenaean glass beads were found to have been made with glass from both regions. The fact that the beads are stylistically Mycenaean would imply an import of raw glass.&lt;ref name="Walton et al 2009"/&gt; Archaeological evidence for this trade comes from the [[Uluburun shipwreck]], dated to the 14th century BC.  As part of its cargo it carried 175 raw glass ingots of cylindrical shape. These ingots match the glass melting crucibles found at [[Amarna]] and [[Pi-Ramesses]]. 

It is not yet possible to discern if trade in glass was occurring directly between the glass producing regions and foreign consumers, it is quite possible that indirect routes via trading and seafaring partners along the Mediterranean coast,  trace element analysis of the Uluburun ingots might allow us to learn more.  At this point we know glass was being consumed by the elites of Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia, it was produced in Egypt and Mesopotamia with workshops possibly specialising in colour and distributed locally presumably through state control to state sponsored artisans, and exported further out as raw glass ingots.

== The Mediterranean during Roman times ==

From [[Hellenistic Glass|Hellenistic]] times glass production sees considerable technological developments culminating with the introduction of glass blowing in the 1st century BC. Glass objects could now be made in large scale production, with less raw material and faster and as a consequence became more common. From the early [[Roman glass|Roman times]], to Byzantine and early [[Glass in Islamic culture|Islamic]] periods the glass from Northern Europe to Eastern Mediterranean shows an incredible compositional homogeneity in its major elements. Unlike the LBA glass, Roman glass was made from the melting of sand and [[natron]] – mineral soda – from the Wadi Natron in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Freestone et al 2000"&gt;Freestone et al 2000&lt;/ref&gt; With one raw material being common to all glass it should be possible to differentiate between glass made from different sands using composition variation of the trace elements and certain isotope ratios.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter et al 2005, Freestone et al 2003, Leslie et al 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These compositional analyses aimed to investigate two models for glass production:
glass was produced in large scale primary workshops along the Levantine coast&lt;ref name="Freestone et al 2000"/&gt; and Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;Nenna et al 2000&lt;/ref&gt; mixing natron and sand from the mouth of the Belus river – as mentioned by Pliny – and then traded to local glass working workshops. If natron was traded and mixed with local sands following a strict recipe could result in the homogeneous composition.

Glass making furnaces have been uncovered in Israel at two sites – 17 at Bet Eli'ezer and 3 at [[Apollonia-Arsuf|Apollonia]].&lt;ref name="Gorin-Rosen 2000"&gt;Gorin-Rosen 2000&lt;/ref&gt; These are rectangular in shape measuring about 2m x 4m and matching in size a glass slab found inside a cave at [[Beit She'arim National Park|Bet She'arim]]. The resulting slabs would be broken up into chunks that were traded to glass workshops in the Middle East and across the Mediterranean as evidenced by the contemporaneous shipwrecks carrying such glass chunks.&lt;ref name="Gorin-Rosen 2000"/&gt;

The situation is not so simple; these workshops are dated from the 6th to the 11th century AD and although similar the compositions do not exactly match those of the earlier Roman period. Pliny, writing in the 1st century AD, describes glass making in the Levantine coast but also in Italy, Spain and Gaul – however ''the installations that produced the large quantities of primary glass needed to supply the Roman industry have yet to be located''.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie et al 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These same authors report a difference in isotopic ratios for oxygen and strontium that differentiates between Middle eastern and Roman glasses. Other authors counter idea of a unique centralised production with primary production reported from Northern Europe&lt;ref&gt;Jackson et al 2003, Baxter et al 2005 and Wolf et al 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and inferred for Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Silvestri et al 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  	
Evidence for large scale production has only come the Eastern Mediterranean and from latter dates and assumes a continuing glass making tradition. That there was a large scale and centralised production even this early is evidenced by the Ouest Embiez I shipwreck – 3rd century – carrying 8 tons of raw glass.&lt;ref&gt;Foy &amp; Jezegou 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  This however does not exclude the smaller scale local production reported elsewhere.  The Julia Felix, also sunk during the 3rd century AD, was carrying as part of its cargo glass cullet presumably for recycling.&lt;ref&gt;Silvestri et al 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Trace element analysis of colourless glass showed these were made using sands from different sources and giving some support to the de-centralised production hypothesis.

By the 9th century the raw materials for glass shift again to quartz pebbles and plant ash and  the 'forest glass' of medieval Europe. Natron was no longer in use and the low lime composition of the Bet'eliezer glass would be suggestive of a decline in access to the material from at least the 6th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone &amp; Gorin-Rosen 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This could in turn be suggestive of a shift from a trade both in natron and raw glass to tighter control over natron and increase of centralised production.

== South East Asia,  Africa and the Indian Ocean ==

Glass shows up in Northern India at the end of the 2nd millennium BC becoming more common throughout South East Asia during the following millennium. [[glass beadmaking|Glass beads]] in particular become extremely popular and together with bangles form the largest group of glass finds. From its Indian origins, glass beads spread to an area from Africa to Japan, sailing with the monsoon winds and leading to their christening as 'Trade wind beads'.&lt;ref&gt;van der Sleen 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The most common compositional type, representing 40% of the glass finds for the region, is known as mineral soda-alumina glass&lt;ref&gt;Dussubieux et al 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and is found from the 4th century BC to the 16th century AD.  As the name indicates this it is typically characterized by a high alumina content and was made by the probably melting of ''reh'' with local, alumina rich, sands.&lt;ref&gt;Brill &amp; Rising 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Through LA-ICP-MS analysis, however, Carter found that Cambodia had a large amount of glass beads made of potash glass and predominantly high alumina soda glass. Potash glass is a glass that uses potash or K2O as a flux in order to decrease the melting point of the glass and is the most common type of glass found in SE Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Alison|title=Trade and Exchange networks in Iron Age Cambodia: Preliminary results from a compositional analysis of glass beads|journal=Journal of Indo-Pacific Archaeology|date=2011|pages=178–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed compositional data recently summarised by (Lankton, &amp; Dussubieux 2006) has uncovered several  distinct and yet contemporaneous glass technologies across the Indian Ocean, but the geographical assignment is not completely clear.  Two small groups show compositions matching those of natron based Mediterranean glass and Plant-ash Mesopotamian glass, demonstrating trade with these other regions. Trade in raw glass from Egypt to India was described in the 1st century texts of Periplus of the Erythraean, Mesopotamian glass increases in presence with increased [[sasanian glass|Sasanian]] control of the Indian Ocean from the 4th to 6th centuries. It is also possible that some glass was traded via the Silk Road.

The majority of glass beads found in Sub-Saharan Africa pre dating European contact are from Indian or Sri Lankan origin with a recent paper (Dussubieux et al. 2008) demonstrating contact between Kenyan sites and Chaul in the West coast of India for the 9th to the 19th century.  Previously analysed samples from the East coast of Africa and Madagascar could potentially  fit this group but further work is still needed. Whether Chaul was the single port for trade in glass beads or if it was part of several competing ports on that coast is still unknown. Data from a site in South Africa, near the borders with Botswana and Zimbabwe, has tentatively assigned some beads to Islamic 8th century compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Prinsloo &amp; Colomban 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the old camel caravan routes that connected this region to Egypt and the Mediterranean were still in use even for glass at a site with easy access, via the Limpopo river, to the Indian Ocean trade and therefore to the West Indian glass that seem to be the most common.There is enough evidence that in ancient Sri Lanka, glass was manufactured in order to use for magnifying glasses or spectacles.

'''Andrew Blain Baird''' (1 January 1862-9 September 1951) was a Scottish blacksmith and aviation pioneer.

==The Man==
[[File:Andrew Baird Portrait.jpg|thumb|150px|left|alt=Andrew Blain Baird portrait by Christopher Markwell]]
Andrew Blain Baird was born in 1862 in Sandhead on Luce Bay in the Rhinns of Galloway, Scotland. One of three sons, his father was a fisherman and handloom weaver. He became an apprentice to a blacksmith in Sandhead, worked as a lighthouse keeper on Lismore, then as an ironworker at Smith and McLean's on the Clyde shipyards before finally setting up on his own as a blacksmith at 113 High Street in Rothesay, Isle of Bute, when he was 25.

In 1892 at the age of 30 Andrew married Euphemia Martin at Glecknabae Farm on Bute.

[[File:Baird Wedding.jpg|thumb|300px|center|alt=Andrew &amp; Euphemia Baird Marriage]]

Baird was a daring thinker, a pioneer and innovator. He created many improvements to the plough, built a unique model of the triple expansion engine powered by electricity and was one of the original members of the Scottish Aeronautical Society.

==The Dream==
Eager to expand his knowledge of aviation, Baird corresponded with the early aviators Louis Bleriot and S. F. Cody and exchanged information about construction of aircraft and their flight. Inspired by a visit to Blackpool for England's first ever Aviation Week in October 1909, he returned to Rothesay ready to design and build his own sophistocated monoplane similar to Bleriot's but with an engine built by the Alexander Brothers in Edinburgh that was 4-cylinder, air-cooled and with water-cooled valves. The control system he would design for his aircraft would be unlike anything that had been developed at the time. His wife sewed brown trussore silk for the wings.

==Sharing the Dream==
[[File:Baird Team.jpg|thumb|250px|right|alt=Andrew Blain Baird and Aviation Team circa 1910.]]

The Baird monoplane, once completed in his own shop in the summer of 1910, went on show at an exhibition in the Esplanade Flower Garden at the front of Bute.  and then to the amazement and excitement of all it was moved to the Bute Highland Games on 20 August 1910.

From there it was taken for storage and readying directly to a barn owned by Willie Dickie at his farm at Cranlasgvourity, Bute.

==The Historic Day==
[[File:Baird in the Monoplane.jpg|thumb|300px|left|alt=Andrew Blain Baird in the Monoplane circa 1910.]]
Scottish aviation history was about to be made when in the very early morning of 17 September 1910, the Baird Monoplane was taken by a Mr Scott on his horse-drawn wagon to Ettrick Bay - with its wide expanse of sand reminiscent of the Kitty Hawk N.C. site chosen by the Wright Brothers for their historic flight.

In the sunshine and amid the wide golden sands of Ettrick Bay the first entirely Scottish designed and built plane sat ready to make history.

Andrew Baird was, on that day, assisted by his friend Ned Striven who was an Electrical Engineer with the Burgh of Rothesay and who had assisted him with the engine and related design considerations.

==The Baird Monoplane==
[[File:Bairds and prop.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=Baird Family with Monoplane propeller (2010).]]
There alone on the beach sat the aircraft - described as having an exceptionally wide-tracked undercarriage, a canvas pilot's seat, a uniquely designed joystick/wheel for steering, and 71&amp;nbsp;inch propellor,  as seen here being displayed by then 91-year-old Andrew Blain Baird II (son) and Andrew Blain Baird III (grandson) in Rothesay during the Centenary Celebrations in September 2010.

It had a fixed tailwheel and a specially selected Scottish 24&amp;nbsp;hp Edinburgh built engine. The plane was 25 feet long and weighed 380 pounds. It was constructed of a complex tubular steel forward frame and triangular wire braced rear section made with bamboo longerons and tubular steel spacers. The rectangular wings covered in Mrs Baird's sown silk had a 29-foot span and were placed at a slight angle for stability in flight.

'''The plane was ready. Andrew Baird was ready.'''

==The Flight into History==
[[File:Ettricksand.jpg|thumb|300px|left|alt=Ettrick bay sands]]
There on the wide expanse of Ettrick Bay beach, Baird and Ned Striven started the engine. All was ready. Hearts raced with anticipation. A small crowd looked on in amazement. And the flight into history began.

Flight Magazine on 24 September 1910,&lt;ref&gt;Trial with Monoplane at Rothesay, Flight, 24 September 2010 p.780, http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200782.html&lt;/ref&gt; described it as follows:

"Mr Baird was seated in the machine and on the engine being started the plane travelled along the sands at good speed.  Naturally, on clearing the ground, the swerving influence of the axle ceased and the influence of the steering wheel brought the machine sharply round to the right causing it to swoop to the ground. The contact was so sharp that the right wheel buckled and the right plane suffered some abrasion by scraping along the beach."

&lt;center&gt;'''Andrew Blain Baird had realised his dream - he had flown in an aircraft of his own design and construction.'''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;'''His was the first entirely Scottish flight of a heavier than air powered craft.'''&lt;/center&gt;

==The Impact==

Noted pioneer aircraft manufacturer Tommy Sopwith sailed his yacht into Rothesay Bay in 1910 to visit the Marquess and to attend the Highland Games and there viewed the on display Baird monoplane.&lt;ref&gt;A Monoplane at Rothesay, Flight, 3 September 2010 p.713, http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200715.html&lt;/ref&gt; Very impressed, he was given permission to incorporate some of Baird's innovations into the aircraft he was designing and which would have such a great impact on the course of World War I. Over the years, many others from around the world involved in aviation consulted Andrew Baird and learned from his pioneering experience and innovative mind.

==After The Flight==

Today there is little information regarding what became of the Baird Monoplane body. It is, however known that the Edinburgh-made engine rested in Baird's workshop on the High Street until its demolition in the early 1950s making way for council housing and was given to the Museum of Transport in Glasgow, having first been transported to the Glasgow Museum &amp; Art Galleries. The original propeller, which is in excellent condition, was acquired for the private ownership of a Mr Hunter who was a bank manager in Bute. Upon his retirement, he returned to his home in Lanark where he displayed the propeller on a wall in his house for decades. On his death it was left to his family with the hope it would be presented to the Museum of Flight in East Fortune. The presentation of the propeller was made to The Museum of Flight late in 2010 - one hundred years after it last turned.

In 2011 a Baird display area was established in the magnificent Mount Stuart House on the estate of the Marquess of Bute. It is hoped that the propeller and engine can be reunited there in the very near future.

Baird did not patent any of his innovations although they were later incorporated into many aircraft and ocean liners. Baird remained a blacksmith.

==Epilogue==
[[File:Baird memorial.jpg|thumb|180px|right|alt=Andrew Blain Baird memorial.]]
Andrew Blain Baird died in Rothesay, Isle of Bute Scotland on 9 September 1951. He had been predeceased by his wife, Euphemia, on 19 January 1938 and by their two daughters, Agnes in 1909 (aged 5) and Susan in 1909 (aged 1 year). They had a son, John Baird, who joined Andrew in his blacksmith business. Another son Andrew Blain Baird II and his son Andrew Blain Baird III and their family today live in Arbroath.

On 4 July 1952, the local newspaper, The Buteman, ran both an advertisement for his business and a tribute to the man. The ad simply read: "A. B. Baird &amp; Son, General Blacksmiths and Horse-shoers, Implement Makers and Mechanical Engineers - and Ornamental Iron Workers"&lt;ref&gt;The Buteman and Rothesay Express  4 July 1952&lt;/ref&gt; 
The tribute read:

&lt;center&gt;'''"A valiant Scotsman with a creative mind. His hand was ever open and against no man. A man of mettle".'''&lt;/center&gt;

==Baird of Bute Celebrations==
[[File:Baird Monument.JPG|thumb|150px|left|alt=Baird of Bute Society.]]
Commencing with the centenary of Baird's flight and annually on the weekend closest to September 17, a Baird of Bute Festival celebration is held on Bute at the newly renamed Andrew Baird Airstrip, at Ettrick Bay and at the Mount Stuart Estate. Many small planes fly in to Baird airstrip then ceremonially over the beach at Ettrick Bay in front of hundreds of locals and visitors, many flying kites and all cheering in apprecietion. There is a [[hot air balloon festival]], kite flying and games for the whole family, a Baird Ceilidh at Mount Stuart and many other aviation related activities are featured, including the likes of a Royal Navy Sea King helicopter and aerobatics displays. see www.bairdofbute.com

==Baird of Bute Society==
[[File:Baird Society logo.jpg|thumb|100px|right|alt=Baird of Bute Society.]]
The Baird of Bute Society was established in 2011 by Christopher Markwell, a Bute-born Canadian who now, in retirement, lives part of the year in Bute. Markwell was instrumental in bringing Andrew Baird to the fore for the centenary of his historic flight and arranged all of the events of the centenary and most since. The Baird of Bute Society works to keep the historical achievements of Andrew Baird alive and properly recognized through meetings, related writings and papers, DVDs, websites, a museum of Baird artifacts (currently at Mount Stuart), school presentations and curriculum inclusion and the like.

Most importantly, The Society is focused on employing the entrepreneurial achievements of Baird to "inspire" the youth of Bute and Scotland to "aspire" to greater things. Enterprise and mentorship programmes, awards and scholarships are offered to assist in the promotion and development of youth-centered entrepreneurial skills and pursuits.

The Baird of Bute Society is a registered Scottish charity.

Besides advocating for greater safety, comfort, and convenience for bicyclists, many members of the industry promote bicycles for [[Poverty reduction|poverty alleviation]]. Experiments done in Africa ([[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]]) and [[Sri Lanka]] on hundreds of households have shown that a bicycle can increase the income of a poor family by as much as 35%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural poverty alleviation, has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3-10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate poverty in poor nations.

[[World Bicycle Relief]], which specializes in large-scale, comprehensive bicycle distribution programs to aid poverty relief and disaster recovery initiatives in developing countries around the world, includes among its sponsors such notable companies as [[Accell Group]], [[Bicycle Technologies International]], [[Giant Bicycles]], [[GT Bicycles]], [[Quality Bicycle Products]], [[Shimano]], [[SRAM Corporation]], [[Specialized Bicycle Components]], and [[Trek Bicycle Corporation]].

'''Charles Wellington Fisher''' (August 4, 1866&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Footz (2006) 263&lt;/ref&gt; – May 5, 1919)&lt;ref name="pf271" /&gt; was a Canadian politician who served as the first [[Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta]].

== Biography ==

Born in [[Hyde Park, Ontario]], Fisher came to [[Cochrane, Alberta|Cochrane]] from [[Ontario]] in 1899, and became the town's leading merchant. In 1907 he married a niece of the Carling family (of [[Carling]] Brewery fame), and promised her that they would live in a castle. By way of fulfilling that promise, he built a mansion in Cochrane in 1908 (which became the Just Home Guest Ranch in 1931 and was donated to a [[Franciscan]] order in 1948).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stmaryscochrane.ca/history.php |title=The History of St. Mary's Parish |publisher=St. Mary's Parish |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cochrane"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.shaw.ca/ruffbear/Resources.htm |title=Neighboring parks and trails |publisher=Sunterra Ridge/Cochrane Heights Community Association |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1903, [[Arthur Sifton]], the Member of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories]] for [[Banff (N.W.T. electoral district)|Banff]] resigned to become territorial chief justice.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 23&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing by-election, held February 4, Fisher defeated H. J. Richardson to replace him. He served until the district left the Northwest Territories to become part of the new province of [[Alberta]] in 1905.&lt;ref name="by-election" /&gt;  He subsequently ran in [[Banff (provincial electoral district)|Banff]] in Alberta's [[Alberta general election, 1905|inaugural election]]. Though politics in the Northwest Territories had been conducted on a non-partisan basis, this was not the case in Alberta, and Fisher aligned himself with the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]]. In the election, he faced [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] [[Robert Brett]], who had been Sifton's predecessor as Banff MLA from 1891 until 1899.&lt;ref name="by-election" /&gt;  He more than doubled Brett's vote count on his way to an easy victory.&lt;ref name="1905 results" /&gt;

Fisher was part of a Liberal majority of 23 seats in the 25 seat [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], and was one of only seven members with previous legislative experience. In deference to this experience, and as a reward for having beaten Brett, considered a strong opponent, he was elected the first [[Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] on March 15, 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 34&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected in each of the next three elections, in the new riding of [[Cochrane (provincial electoral district)|Cochrane]], and was re-elected Speaker after each of them. As Speaker, he presided over the tumultuous [[Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal]], when he ruled future premier [[Charles Stewart (Canadian politician)|Charles Stewart]] out of order in his attempt to report a scandalous rumour about fellow Liberal [[John R. Boyle]] in the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher died May 5, 1919, a victim of the [[1918 flu pandemic]]. His death left his Cochrane seat vacant, and in the ensuing by-election the [[United Farmers of Alberta]] (UFA) ran a candidate, [[Alexander Moore (politician)|Alexander Moore]], for the first time in their history. He won, and two years later the UFA won a majority government.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 195&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Fisher is buried in Calgary's Union Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Erin |last=Carpenter |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/oncampus/weekly/april22-05/grave-history.html |title=A grave history |publisher=[[University of Calgary]] |work=OnCampus Weekly |date=April 22, 2005 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4624">A '''Counting Point''', in short 'CP', is a certain spot for planning, controlling and monitoring material flow items e.g. single parts, assembly groups, final [[Product (business)|product]]s, bins, racks, [[container]], freight carrier, etc.  In business and operational practice there are different terms that are used instead of "counting point" like 'status point' or 'data acquisition point', 'check point' or 'control point' which means quasi the same (&lt;ref&gt; F. Klug: ''Logistikmanagement in der Automobilindustrie.'' 2010, p. 294 &lt;/ref&gt;).

== Installing of Counting Points ==
If the production and material flow gets more and more complex then more counting points must be installed in the process of [[transport]], [[shipping]] and [[manufacturing]]. Especially check points for [[quality control]] and [[quality assurance]]) can be used outstandingly as counting points but also [[data acquisition]] points in material handling processes. For better planning and monitoring of material flow items it is helpful to order all counting points in such a way that the requirements of an ideal Boolean [[Interval (mathematics)]] Algebra can be fulfilled. Boolean Intervals are half-opened and a counting point lays always inside at the beginning and the ending lays outside and is the entry-point of the next-following interval. Such an interval can represent any kind of stretch in production and material flow e.g. an [[assembly line]], a storage or [[warehouse]], a transport route etc. Alternative production and transportation stretches are mapped as parallel intervals, which are logical equivalent but have their own different data acquisition points. If a flow item passes a certain CP it has left the preceding interval and stays in the concerned interval at the same time. By this it can be assured that a flow object can stay only in one interval at a certain moment which is also true and evident for parallel intervals &lt;ref&gt; Herlyn: ''PPS im Automobilbau.'' 2012, p. 131 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;. This kind of mapping material flow structure is necessary for a consistent calculation of the [[lead-time]] and complete cycle time for flow items which is extremely important not only for material flow planning but also for [[production planning]] and [[manufacturing operations management]] in general.

== Using of Counting Points ==
Counting Points are used in different logistic areas like transportation, material handling, goods [[receipt]] and goods issue at the border of a plant, because this is often transfer of ownership. Another well-known counting points are receiving and issuing material items at the border of a storage or [[warehouse]]. Counting points play an important rule also in manufacturing and production [[scheduling]] and different concepts of [[material requirements planning]] e.g for the concept of [[Cumulative quantities (logistics)]] &lt;ref&gt; H.-P. Wiendahl: ''Fertigungsregelung – Logistische Beherrschung von Fertigungsabläufen auf Basis des Trichtermodells'', p. 344 ff &lt;/ref&gt; and the 'gross-net-method'. We can find CP also in the [[automotive industry]] where the production flow of a car is controlled, scheduled and monitored continuously at exactly defined check points resp. status points for the different manufacturing departments and shops and where the data is used for scheduling and optimization.

'''DIRKS''', an acronym for '''Designing and Implementing Recordkeeping Systems''', is a [https://www.opengov.nsw.gov.au/publications/17383 comprehensive manual] outlining the process for creating [[records management]] systems including various business information records and transactions as outlined in the [[Australian Standard]] for Records Management - AS ISO 15489.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macintosh|first1=Stephen|last2=Real|first2=Lynne|title=DIRKS: Putting ISO 15489 to Work|journal=The Information Management Journal|date=April 2007|pages=50–56|url=http://www.arma.org/bookstore/files/Macintosh_Real.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; DIRKS was developed by the [[National Archives of Australia]] in collaboration with the [[State Records Authority of New South Wales]].

The manual consists of two parts, part one is the user's guide and part two is the set of steps themselves. DIRKS is an eight-step process in which all aspects, or as many as possible, of a business are studied in order to achieve a complete [[records management]] practice. In addition to these eight steps DIRKS includes several templates and questionnaires to guide one through the DIRKS methodology.

DIRKS was replaced in 2007 at the Australian Commonwealth level, but continues to be in use at state level in New South Wales as a non-tool to assist the public sector in complying with the [[State Records Authority of New South Wales]] State Records Act 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DIRKS and the State Records Act |url=http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/recordkeeping/advice/designing-implementing-and-managing-systems/dirks-manual/dirks-and-the-state-records-act |website=NSW Government State Records |publisher=The State Records Authority of New South Wales, Australia |accessdate=28 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916165532/http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/recordkeeping/advice/designing-implementing-and-managing-systems/dirks-manual/dirks-and-the-state-records-act |archivedate=16 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steps of the DIRKS methodology==

* '''Step A: Preliminary investigation;'''
Before a preliminary investigation occurs DIRKS suggests a pre-preliminary investigation is performed where it is established if there is a need for a [[records management]] program at the organization and is there support for a record keeping system to be put in place. If so the preliminary investigation can take place. There are four components to the DIRKS preliminary investigation.
# Determine the scope of the preliminary investigation
# Collect Information
# Document the research of the investigation
# Report to Senior Management

* '''Step B: Analysis of business activity;'''
The purpose of Step B is to create a set of advisory statements from which an analysis of the organization's business activities can be determined. DIRKS suggests a set of systematic approaches to analyze an organization in a systematic way in order to reveal various business activities, how they are completed and who completes them.

* '''Step C: Identification of recordkeeping requirements;'''
Step C has two main objectives. The first is to determine an organization's requirements in creation and retention of records of its business activities. The second objective is to document the determined requirements in a clear manner that can be used as a reference in the future.

* '''Step D: Assessment of existing systems;'''
The main objective of Step D is to assess the existing recordkeeping systems and any other related information management systems that have the capacity to capture and maintain records. This assessment is to identify weaknesses and strengths within the existing system.

* '''Step E: Identification of strategies for recordkeeping;'''
The main objective of Step E is to determine which policies, procedures, standards and various other tools will help the organization achieve its recordkeeping goals. With these strategies established a model for both record management and recordkeeping can be created.

* '''Step F: Design of a recordkeeping system;'''
The objective in Step F is to use the information gained in steps A through E a plan can be developed that fulfills the requirements set out in Step C. The design should repair any faults found in Step D and include a full plan for integrating the new recordkeeping system

* '''Step G: Implementation of a recordkeeping system;'''
The objective of Step G is put the recordkeeping system that was designed in Step F in place.

* '''Step H: Post-implementation review.'''
The objective of Step H is to measure the effectiveness of the installed system and to make sure that in practice in fulfills all requirements as established and documented throughout the DIRKS manual.

'''DealCenter''' is a social media platform and online meeting management system used at trade shows and events for arranging face-to-face meetings.  DealCenter, LLC was established January 2008 though the online meeting planner has been designed and in use by [[Jaymie Scotto &amp; Associates]] as an event planning product since 2005, pre-dating today’s social networking communities.  The DealCenter platform is an easy and user-friendly way to see who else is attending or exhibiting an event, to search the list of attendees by relevant information (such as company name, product offering or area served etc.) and then to create one-on-one meetings that will be held on-site at the event.  The DealCenter system is traditionally rolled out months before the show date, so attendees can pre-plan their meetings and attend the event with a scheduled timetable of targeted prospect, customer or partner meetings.

To utilize the platform, attendees and exhibitors log on to the customized event website and are able to see the profiles of other participants who will be attending the event. The DealCenter manages the meeting schedules, accepts or declines invitations and allows users to send secure messages via the DealCenter to further expand the business opportunity pipeline. All the planning is done through the platform interface, enabling users to arrive with a roster of meetings already scheduled and confirmed. No contact information is shared or released unless the user voluntarily provides it. The confirmed meetings are assigned a table number and held on-site in a designated area, including, if desired, meeting rooms, bilateral tables, exhibit booths and/or a DealCenter Area. 
The '''DealCenter Concierge Service''' is a new development within the DealCenter technology. The Concierge Service automatically schedules meetings on a user's behalf based on the information provided when creating a profile.

'''Eugen Viktor Feller''' (26 January 1871 – 15 November 1936) was a [[Croatia]]n pharmacist, [[entrepreneur]] and pioneer of the industrial drug production in Croatia.

Feller was born in 1871, in [[Lwów]] region, which after the [[partition of Poland]] was at the time a part of [[Austro-Hungary]] province known as [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], to a [[Jew]]ish&lt;ref name="žz"&gt;{{harvtxt|Snješka Knežević|2011|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; family of David and Elizabeta ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Holzer) Feller. He was married to Ida (née Oehmichen) Feller, with whom he had twelve children, among them [[William Feller]]. In the late 19th century, Feller achieved fame with the elixir "Elsa Fluid" (named after his mother nickname, Elsa), whose production along with other cosmetic preparations took place in [[Donja Stubica]]. In Donja Stubica, Feller built the pharmaceutical factory, laboratory, and family house with pharmacy. Feller presented "Elsa Fluid" as a cure for all diseases. It was exported in almost all European countries, as well as [[Egypt]], [[Japan]] and [[China]], while in the [[United States]] it was very popular at the time of [[Prohibition]], due to high percentage of alcohol in its content. Feller was great philanthropist who financially helped the students, poor families, children and various societies. In 1918, he opened a trust fund to help the mothers of soldiers who were killed in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.donjastubica.hr/donja-stubica/povijest.html|title=Povijest Donja Stubica|publisher=[[Donja Stubica]]|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Jasenka Ferber Bogdan; Investicije farmaceuta Eugena Viktora Fellera, pionira industrijske proizvodnje lijekova u Hrvatskoj; 34 internacionalni kongres za povijest farmacije; Listopad 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Stella Fatović-Ferenčić, Jasenka Ferber Bogdan; Ljekarna K Sv.

It is also significant, in that it represented a major victory in the fight against discrimination aimed at [[Japanese Canadians]], which was especially prevalent in [[British Columbia]] in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harvey|2004|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Until the early 1920s federal policy governing access to fishing licenses was basically open and
non-discriminatory. In 1922, under what became known as the "oriental exclusion policy", this was revised to provide for the reduction of the number of licenses granted to Japanese-Canadian fishermen, aiming to eventual total elimination of such licenses. In addition, conditions were attached for the prohibition of gas motors on such fishermen's vessels.{{sfn|Harvey|2004|pp=4{{endash}}5}}

The controversy came to a head in 1927 as a prosecution against the Somerville Cannery Company for operating a [[fish canning|cannery]] in [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]] without a federal license. The cannery was operating as a floating clam cannery, the only one of its kind. All other canneries were on land.{{sfn|Harvey|2004|p=7}} Francis Millerd, general manager and part-owner of Somerville, challenged the oriental exclusion policy through hiring Japanese-Canadian fishermen and lobbying to secure salmon fishing licenses for them. Charges against Somerville were dismissed, on the grounds that fish canneries did not require a federal license.{{sfn|Harvey|2004|p=8}} Further pressure by Somerville and the Association of Fishermen of Japanese Origin resulted in the following [[reference question]]s being posed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]:
 
{{quote|
:1. Are sections 7A and 18 of the ''Fisheries Act, 1914'', or either of them and in what particular or particulars or to what extent ''[[ultra vires]]'' of the [[Parliament of Canada]]?
:2. If the said provisions of the ''Fisheries Act, 1914'', or either of them be ''[[intra vires]]'' of the Parliament of Canada, has the Minister authority to issue a license for the operation of a floating cannery constructed on a float or ship, as contradistinguished from a stationary cannery constructed on land, and if so, is he entitled to make the license subject to any restrictions particularly as to the place of operation of any such cannery in British Columbia?
:3. Under the provisions of the ''Special Fishery Regulations'' for the province of British Columbia (made by the Governor in Council under the authority of section 45 of the ''Fisheries Act, 1914''), respecting licenses to fish, viz., subsection 3 of section 14; paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection 1 of section 15 or paragraph (a) of subsection 7 of section 24 of the said regulations, or under said section 7A or 18 of the said Act, (if these sections or either of them be ''intra vires'' of the Parliament of Canada), has
::(a) any British subject resident in the province of British Columbia, or
::(b) any person so resident who is not a British subject, upon application and tender of the prescribed fee, the right to receive a license to fish or to operate a fish or salmon cannery in that province, or has the Minister a discretionary authority to grant or refuse such license to any such person whether a British subject or not?
}}

==At the Supreme Court of Canada==

The Supreme Court unanimously held that the provisions cited in Question 1 were ''ultra vires'' the Parliament of Canada, as [[fish canning]] only occurs after the fish have been caught, thus not being within the federal fisheries jurisdiction. As a fish cannery is similar in nature to a fruit or vegetable cannery, it is a civil right in the province in which it is carried on, and therefore subject to provincial jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;SCC Reference, p. 471&lt;/ref&gt;

Nor could such provisions be saved by resorting to another head of power:

{{quote|
Within the spheres allotted to them by the (B.N.A.) Act the Dominion and the Provinces are rendered on general principle co-ordinate governments. As a consequence where one has legislative power the other has not, speaking broadly, the capacity to pass laws which will interfere with its exercise. What cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Haldane]] in {{cite BAILII|litigants=The Great West Saddlery Company Limited and others v The King|link=|court=UKPC|year=1921|num=27|para=|parallelcite=[1921] AC 91|date=25 February 1921|courtname=auto|juris=Canada|format=1}}, at p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

It was unnecessary to answer Question 2.
[[Image:Newcombe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edmund Leslie Newcombe|Newcombe J]]]]
In a 4-3 decision concerning Question 3, it was held that the Minister must issue fishing licenses to all qualified persons that paid the appropriate fee, and there was no discretionary authority to withhold such licenses.

[[Edmund Leslie Newcombe|Newcombe J]] ([[Francis Alexander Anglin|Anglin CJ]] and [[Thibaudeau Rinfret|Rinfret]] and [[John Henderson Lamont|Lamont]] JJ, concurring) stated that the Minister could not exercise his licensing discretion in a discriminatory manner:

{{quote|
... no legislative power is delegated to the Minister, even if the Governor in Council could delegate any of his statutory powers. No express power is conferred upon the Minister, except to issue licenses, and, in my view, it is improbable that it was intended to confer a reviewable discretion, or that, unless by plain legislative direction, discretionary licensing authority would have been granted which could be exercised in a manner which might sanction discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;SCC Reference, p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Lyman Duff|Duff J]] ([[Pierre-Basile Mignault|Mignault]] and [[Robert Smith (judge)|Smith]] JJ, concurring) believed that "There is nothing in the terms in which these provisions are expressed, nor, as far as I have been able to discover, in the terms of the regulations, pointing to a conclusion that the authority of the Minister is not a permissive one."&lt;ref&gt;SCC Reference, p. 464&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government chose to ignore the ruling, pending appeal to the Privy Council.{{sfn|Harvey|2004|pp=11{{endash}}12}} In the interim, prosecutions against Japanese-Canadian fishermen were being dismissed in the lower courts.{{sfn|Harvey|2004|p=13}} The Association of Fishermen of Japanese Origin, having intervened in the hearing at the Supreme Court, were also respondents in the appeal.
{{-}}

==At the Privy Council==

The Judicial Committee upheld the ruling of the Supreme Court in its entirety. Before proceeding with the appeal at hand, [[Thomas Tomlin, Baron Tomlin|Lord Tomlin]] considered the matter of where federal and provincial jurisdiction arise under Canadian constitutional law, and gave his summary of where the jurisprudence stood at that time:

{{quote|
Questions of conflict between the jurisdiction of the Parliament of the Dominion and provincial jurisdiction have frequently come before the Lordships' Board and as a result of the decisions of the Board the following propositions may be stated:{{Emdash}}

# The legislation of the Parliament of the Dominion, so long as it strictly relates to subjects of legislation expressly enumerated in section 91, is of paramount authority, even if it trenches upon matters assigned to the Provincial Legislature by section 92.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Tennant v The Union Bank of Canada|link=|court=UKPC|year=1893|num=53|para=|parallelcite=[1894] AC 31|date=9 December 1893|courtname=auto|juris=Ontario|format=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The general power of legislation conferred up on the Parliament of the Dominion by section 91 of the Act in supplement of the power to legislate upon the subjects expressly enumerated must be strictly confined to such matters as are unquestionably of national interest and importance, and must not trench on any of the subjects enumerated in section 92, as within the scope of Provincial legislation, unless these matters have attained such dimensions  as to affect the body politic of the Dominion.&lt;ref name = "LPC"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=The Attorney General for Ontario v The Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada ("Local Prohibition Case")|link=Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion|court=UKPC|year=1896|num=20|para=|parallelcite=[1896] AC 348|date=9 May 1896|courtname=auto|juris=Canada|format=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# It is within the competence of the Dominion Parliament to provide for matters which though otherwise within the legislative competence of the Provincial Legislature, are necessarily incidental to effective legislation by the Parliament of the Dominion upon a subject of legislation expressly enumerated in section 91.&lt;ref name = "LPC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Attorney General of Ontario v Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada ("Assignments and Preferences Case")|link=|court=UKPC|year=1894|num=13|para=|parallelcite=[1894] AC 189|date=24 February 1894|courtname=auto|juris=Ontario|format=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There can be a domain in which Provincial and Dominion legislation may overlap, in which case, neither legislation will be ''[[ultra vires]]'' if the field is clear, but if the field is not clear and the two legislations meet, the Dominion legislation must prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=The Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v The Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada|link=|court=UKPC|year=1906|num=72|para=|parallelcite=[1907] AC 65|date=5 November 1906|courtname=auto|juris=Canada|format=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Tomlin then turned to the question as to where jurisdiction over fish canneries fell. In that regard,

{{quote|
...trade processes by which fish when caught are converted into a commodity suitable to be placed upon the market cannot upon any reasonable principle of construction be brought within the scope of the subject expressed by the words "Sea Coast and Inland Fisheries."{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=22}}
}}

As such activity could not be seen to fall under any other heading of [[Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867|s. 91]], and a licensing system could not reasonably be seen to be incidental to the federal power, it therefore fell within provincial jurisdiction.

The Association of Fishermen of Japanese Origin were awarded their costs in the appeal.

==Impact==

The gas boat restriction and the oriental exclusion policy were abandoned for the 1930 fishing season, and discrimination in the fishing industry came to an end.{{sfn|Harvey|2004|p=16}}

On a larger view, the ''Fish Canneries Reference'' is considered to be one of the main foundations of Canadian constitutional jurisprudence,{{sfn|Harvey|2004|pp=1{{endash}}2}} and its four-part summary of how to determine jurisdiction was subsequently cited with approval in the ''[[In re Regulation and Control of Aeronautics in Canada|Aeronautics Reference]]'' in 1931.

The question of ministerial discretionary authority, and the extent as to how far it can go, continued to be debated, eventually to be settled by the Supreme Court in ''[[Roncarelli v. Duplessis]]''.{{sfn|Harvey|2004|p=14}}

A '''fluidized bed reactor''' ('''FBR''') is a type of [[Chemical reactor|reactor]] device that can be used to carry out a variety of [[Phase (matter)|multiphase]] chemical reactions. In this type of reactor, a [[fluid]] (gas or liquid) is passed through a solid [[granular material]] (usually a [[catalyst]] possibly shaped as tiny spheres) at high enough [[velocity|velocities]] to suspend the solid and cause it to behave as though it were a fluid. This process, known as [[fluidization]], imparts many important advantages to the FBR. As a result, the fluidized bed reactor is now used in many industrial applications.

[[Image:Fluidized Bed Reactor Graphic.svg|right|300px|thumb|Basic diagram of a fluidized bed reactor]]

==Basic principles==
The solid substrate (the catalytic material upon which chemical species react) material in the fluidized bed reactor is typically supported by a [[porous]] plate, known as a distributor.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;Howard, J. R. (1989). ''Fluidized Bed Technology: Principles and Applications.'' New York, NY: Adam Higler.&lt;/ref&gt; The fluid is then forced through the distributor up through the solid material. At lower fluid velocities, the solids remain in place as the fluid passes through the voids in the material. This is known as a [[packed bed]] reactor. As the fluid velocity is increased, the reactor will reach a stage where the force of the fluid on the solids is enough to balance the weight of the solid material. This stage is known as incipient fluidization and occurs at this minimum fluidization velocity. Once this minimum velocity is surpassed, the contents of the reactor bed begin to expand and swirl around much like an agitated tank or boiling pot of water. The reactor is now a fluidized bed. Depending on the operating conditions and properties of solid phase various flow regimes can be observed in this reactor.

==History and current uses==
Fluidized bed reactors are a relatively new tool in the chemical engineering field. The first fluidized bed gas generator was developed by Fritz Winkler in Germany in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;Tavoulareas, S. (1991.) Fluidized-Bed Combustion Technology. **Annual Reviews Inc.** 16, 25-27.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first United States fluidized bed reactors used in the petroleum industry was the Catalytic Cracking Unit, created in Baton Rouge, LA in 1942 by the [[Standard Oil Company]] of New Jersey (now [[ExxonMobil]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = First Commercial Fluid Bed Reactor | work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/fluidbedreactor.html | accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This FBR and the many to follow were developed for the oil and petrochemical industries. Here [[catalysts]] were used to reduce petroleum to simpler compounds through a process known as [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]]. The invention of this technology made it possible to significantly increase the production of various fuels in the United States.&lt;ref name="third"&gt;Thornhill, D. [http://faculty.washington.edu/finlayso/Fluidized_Bed/ The Fluidized Bed Reactor Page]. Retrieved February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Today fluidized bed reactors are still used to produce gasoline and other fuels, along with many other chemicals. Many industrially produced [[polymers]] are made using FBR technology, such as [[rubber]], [[vinyl chloride]], [[polyethylene]], [[styrenes]], and [[polypropylene]].&lt;ref name="Technology Economics Program"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magcloud.com/browse/issue/411008|title= Polypropylene Production via Gas Phase Process, Technology Economics Program|publisher=by Intratec, {{ISBN|978-0-615-66694-5}}, Q3 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various utilities also use FBR's for [[coal gasification]], nuclear power plants, and water and waste treatment settings. Used in these applications, fluidized bed reactors allow for a cleaner, more efficient process than previous standard reactor technologies.&lt;ref name="third"/&gt;

==Advantages==
The increase in fluidized bed reactor use in today's industrial world is largely due to the inherent advantages of the technology.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Trambouze, P., &amp; Euzen, J. (2004). ''Chemical Reactors: From Design to Operation.'' (R. Bononno, Trans.). Paris: Editions Technip.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Uniform Particle Mixing:''' Due to the intrinsic fluid-like behavior of the solid material, fluidized beds do not experience poor mixing as in packed beds. This complete mixing allows for a uniform product that can often be hard to achieve in other reactor designs. The elimination of radial and axial concentration [[gradients]] also allows for better fluid-solid contact, which is essential for reaction efficiency and quality.
* '''Uniform Temperature Gradients:''' Many chemical reactions require the addition or removal of heat. Local hot or cold spots within the reaction bed, often a problem in packed beds, are avoided in a fluidized situation such as an FBR. In other reactor types, these local temperature differences, especially hotspots, can result in product degradation. Thus FBRs are well suited to [[exothermic]] reactions. Researchers have also learned that the bed-to-surface [[heat transfer]] coefficients for FBRs are high.
* '''Ability to Operate Reactor in Continuous State:''' The fluidized bed nature of these reactors allows for the ability to continuously withdraw product and introduce new reactants into the reaction vessel. Operating at a [[Continuous production|continuous process]] state allows manufacturers to produce their various products more efficiently due to the removal of startup conditions in [[Batch reactor|batch processes]].

==Disadvantages==
As in any design, the fluidized bed reactor does have it draw-backs, which any reactor designer must take into consideration.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;
* '''Increased Reactor Vessel Size:''' Because of the expansion of the bed materials in the reactor, a larger vessel is often required than that for a packed bed reactor. This larger vessel means that more must be spent on initial capital costs.
* '''Pumping Requirements and Pressure Drop:''' The requirement for the fluid to suspend the solid material necessitates that a higher fluid velocity is attained in the reactor. In order to achieve this, more pumping power and thus higher energy costs are needed. In addition, the [[pressure drop]] associated with deep beds also requires additional pumping power.
* '''Particle Entrainment:''' The high gas velocities present in this style of reactor often result in fine particles becoming [[Entrainment (engineering)|entrained]] in the fluid. These captured particles are then carried out of the reactor with the fluid, where they must be separated. This can be a very difficult and expensive problem to address depending on the design and function of the reactor. This may often continue to be a problem even with other entrainment reducing technologies.
* '''Lack of Current Understanding:''' Current understanding of the actual behavior of the materials in a fluidized bed is rather limited. It is very difficult to predict and calculate the complex mass and heat flows within the bed. Due to this lack of understanding, a [[pilot plant]] for new processes is required. Even with pilot plants, the scale-up can be very difficult and may not reflect what was experienced in the pilot trial.
* '''Erosion of Internal Components:''' The fluid-like behavior of the fine solid particles within the bed eventually results in the wear of the reactor vessel. This can require expensive maintenance and upkeep for the reaction vessel and pipes.
* '''Pressure Loss Scenarios:''' If fluidization pressure is suddenly lost, the surface area of the bed may be suddenly reduced.  This can either be an inconvenience (e.g. making bed restart difficult), or may have more serious implications, such as runaway reactions (e.g. for exothermic reactions in which heat transfer is suddenly restricted).

==Current research and trends==
Due to the advantages of fluidized bed reactors, a large amount of research is devoted to this technology. Most current research aims to quantify and explain the behavior of the phase interactions in the bed. Specific research topics include particle size distributions, various transfer coefficients, phase interactions, velocity and pressure effects, and computer modeling.&lt;ref name="fifth"&gt;Arastoopour, H. (Ed.). (1998). ''Fluidization and Fluid Particle Systems: Recent Research and Development.'' New York, NY: American Institute of Chemical Engineers.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of this research is to produce more accurate models of the inner movements and phenomena of the bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abbasi|first=Mohammad Reza|last2=Shamiri|first2=Ahmad|last3=Hussain|first3=M.A.|title=Dynamic modeling and Molecular Weight Distribution of ethylene copolymerization in an industrial gas-phase Fluidized-Bed Reactor|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0921883116300978|journal=Advanced Powder Technology|volume=27|issue=4|pages=1526–1538|doi=10.1016/j.apt.2016.05.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will enable chemical engineers to design better, more efficient reactors that may effectively deal with the current disadvantages of the technology and expand the range of FBR use.

'''Francesco Illy''' ({{lang-hu|Illy Ferenc}}; 1892, [[Temesvár]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] (now [[Timișoara]], [[Romania]]) – 1956, [[Trieste]], [[Italy]]) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] financial accountant, bookkeeper, business magnate, philanthropist, the founder of [[illy]] and [[inventor]] of coffee machinery.

==Biography==
Illy was born to a middle-class family in Temesvár (now [[Timisoara]], [[Romania]]). His father, János Illy was a carpenter. His mother, Aloisia Rössler was [[Danube Swabians|Danube Swabian]]. He studied economics in Temesvár. After secondary school he moved to [[Vienna]], where he worked for two big Transylvanian companies.
At the age of 22 he was [[Conscription|conscripted]] into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], and served from 1914 at almost every front of the First World War, including at the [[Battle of Kraśnik]] and the [[Battles of the Isonzo]].

After the war he stayed with his sister in [[Trieste]], where he soon married a Triestine woman. He found work with companies dealing with [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coffee roasting]]. He later invented his own method for maintaining the quality of freshly roasted coffee so it could be delivered to other locations rather than roasting it on site. He formed a partnership with the local coffee manufacturers Hausbrandt.

In 1933 Illy founded [[illycaffè]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=Fortune magazine |title=Crisis in a Coffee Cup |first=Nicholas |last=Stein |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/12/09/333463/index.htm |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which invented the first automatic coffee machine which substituted pressurized water for steam. The ''Illetta'' became the predecessor of today's [[espresso machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=John |last=Tagliabue |title=Coffeehouses as Fashion Boutiques; Selling Cachet by the Cup |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/26/business/worldbusiness/26eurocoffee.html?pagewanted=1&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/C/Coffee |publisher=The New York Times |date=26 December 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His son, the food chemist [[Ernesto Illy]] (1925–2008) took over the management of the coffee company, which is now in the hands of the third generation Illys.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4992">'''Eugene Lawrence "Gene" Case''' (December 6, 1937 &amp;ndash; September 9, 2010) was an American [[advertising]] executive who developed campaigns for Mennen [[Skin Bracer]] and [[Tums]], and developed ads for political campaigns for [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]] campaign, as well as for [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and [[Robert F. Wagner]]. Case was a founder of the firm Jordan McGrath Case &amp; Partners.

Case was born on December 6, 1937, in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], where his father worked for the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]. The success his father had in the [[New Deal]] helped shape Case's liberal philosophy, saying "''I saw government lift [my home] region out of Appalachian-style poverty".&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Todd.

He entered the advertising field in 1961, when he took a position as a copywriter at the [[J. Walter Thompson]] agency.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Weber, Bruce.

Case wrote the copy for another Johnson ad in which a man who says he had always been a Republican speaks to the camera for four minutes about his fear of [[Barry Goldwater]] being elected. Case worked for [[Nelson Rockefeller]]'s successful bid for a third term as [[Governor of New York]] in the [[New York state election, 1966|1966 elections]] where he produced ads on pollution control, and he later worked on [[New York City]] mayoral bids by [[Robert F. Wagner]] and [[Bella Abzug]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

Case founded Jordan McGrath Case &amp; Partners with [[Helmut Krone]] in 1969, operating out of a suite at the [[Plaza Hotel]], with Pat McGrath joining shortly thereafter.

I needed that." campaign for Mennen's Skin Bracer aftershave and the ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''-inspired "tum-ta-tum-tum" for [[Tums]] antacid. At its peak in the 1990s the firm had 350 employees and $500 million in annual billings. He and his partners sold Jordan McGrath to the [[France|French]] advertising firm [[Havas]] in 1999.&lt;ref name=NYT1999/&gt;

Case established the advocacy ad group Avenging Angels in 2002, creating ads for liberal causes such as those that supported a ban on assault weapons, opposed the war in Iraq, sought to stem nuclear proliferation and for the [[Hudson River]] advocacy group [[Riverkeeper]]. He told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that he was glad that he had made the shift back to issue advertising, saying "I've never been so productive, so happy — and so poor."&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; Anti-Iraq War ads that Case had developed featuring [[Janeane Garofalo]] and [[Susan Sarandon]] in February 2003 were rejected by the major U.S. broadcast networks which said that they don't accept advocacy ads.&lt;ref name=NYT1999&gt;Lauro, Patricia Winters.

Case died in [[Manhattan]] at age 72 on September 9, 2010, due to a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. He was survived by his third wife and their daughter, a daughter and two sons from his first marriage, a son from his second marriage and nine grandchildren.

'''Henry Dunant''' (born '''Jean-Henri Dunant'''; 8 May 1828 – 30 October 1910), also known as '''Henri Dunant''', was a Swiss businessman and social activist, the founder of the [[Red Cross]], and the first recipient of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. The 1864 [[Geneva Convention]] was based on Dunant's ideas. In 1901 he received the first [[Nobel Peace Prize]] together with [[Frédéric Passy]], making Dunant the first Swiss Nobel laureate.

During a business trip in 1859, Dunant was witness to the aftermath of the [[Battle of Solferino]] in modern-day Italy. He recorded his memories and experiences in the book ''[[A Memory of Solferino]]'' which inspired the creation of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) in 1863.

== Early life and education ==
[[File:Henry Dunant 1855.jpg|left|thumb|Henry Dunant in 1855]]
Dunant was born in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, in 1828 as the first son of businessman Jean-Jacques Dunant and Antoinette Dunant-Colladon. His family was devoutly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and had significant influence in Geneva society. His parents stressed the value of social work, and his father was active helping orphans and parolees, while his mother worked with the sick and poor. His father worked in a prison and an orphanage.

Dunant grew up during the period of religious awakening known as the ''[[Réveil]]'', and at age 18 he joined the Geneva Society for Alms giving. In the following year, together with friends, he founded the so-called "Thursday Association", a loose band of young men that met to study the Bible and help the poor, and he spent much of his free time engaged in prison visits and social work. On 30 November 1852, he founded the Geneva chapter of the [[YMCA]] and three years later he took part in the Paris meeting devoted to the founding of its international organization.

In 1849, at age 21, Dunant was forced to leave the [[Collège Calvin|Collège de Genève]] due to poor grades, and he began an apprenticeship with the money-changing firm ''Lullin et Sautter''. After its successful conclusion, he remained as an employee of the bank.

== Algeria ==
In 1853, Dunant visited Algeria, Tunisia, and [[Sicily]], on assignment with a company devoted to the "colonies of Setif" (''Compagnie genevoise des Colonies de Sétif''). Despite little experience, he successfully fulfilled the assignment. Inspired by the trip, he wrote his first book with the title ''An Account of the Regency in Tunis'' (''Notice sur la Régence de Tunis''), published in 1858.

In 1856, he created a business to operate in foreign colonies, and, after being granted a land concession by French-occupied Algeria, a corn-growing and trading company called the Financial and Industrial Company of Mons-Djémila Mills (''Société financière et industrielle des Moulins des Mons-Djémila''). However, the land and water rights were not clearly assigned, and the colonial authorities were not especially cooperative. As a result, Dunant decided to appeal directly to French emperor [[Napoléon III]], who was with his army in [[Lombardy]] at the time. France was fighting on the side of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], who had occupied much of today's Italy. Napoleon's headquarters were located in the small city of [[Solferino]]. Dunant wrote a flattering book full of praise for Napoleon III with the intention to present it to the emperor, and then traveled to Solferino to meet with him personally.

== Battle of Solferino ==
[[File:Battaglia di Solferino (Henry Dunant).jpg|thumb|Henry Dunant at Solferino]]
Dunant arrived in [[Solferino]] on the evening of 24 June 1859, on the same day a [[Battle of Solferino|battle]] between the two sides had occurred nearby. Twenty-three thousand wounded, dying and dead remained on the battlefield, and there appeared to be little attempt to provide care. Shocked, Dunant himself took the initiative to organize the civilian population, especially the women and girls, to provide assistance to the injured and sick soldiers. They lacked sufficient materials and supplies, and Dunant himself organized the purchase of needed materials and helped erect makeshift hospitals. He convinced the population to service the wounded without regard to their side in the conflict as per the slogan "''Tutti fratelli''" (All are brothers) coined by the women of nearby city [[Castiglione delle Stiviere]]. He also succeeded in gaining the release of Austrian doctors captured by the French.

== Red Cross ==
After returning to [[Geneva]] early in July, Dunant decided to write a book about his experiences, which he titled ''Un Souvenir de Solferino'' (''[[A Memory of Solferino]]''). It was published in 1862 in an edition of 1,600 copies and was printed at Dunant's own expense. In the book, he described the battle, its costs, and the chaotic circumstances afterwards. He also developed the idea that in the future a neutral organization should exist to provide care to wounded soldiers. He distributed the book to many leading political and military figures in Europe.
[[Image:Committee of Five Geneva 1863.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing of the five founders of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|International Committee]].]]

Dunant also began to travel through Europe to promote his ideas. His book was largely positively received, and the President of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare, jurist [[Gustave Moynier]], made the book and its suggestions the topic of the 9 February 1863 meeting of the organization. Dunant's recommendations were examined and positively assessed by the members. They
created a five-person Committee to further pursue the possibility of their implementation and made Dunant one of the members. The others were Moynier, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] army general [[Henri Dufour]], and doctors [[Louis Appia]] and [[Théodore Maunoir]]. Their first meeting on 17 February 1863 is now considered the founding date of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].

From early on, Moynier and Dunant had increasing disagreements and conflicts regarding their respective visions and plans. Moynier considered Dunant's idea to establish neutrality protections for care providers unfeasible and advised Dunant not to insist upon this concept. However, Dunant continued to advocate this position in his travels and conversations with high-ranking political and military figures. This intensified the personal conflict between Moynier, who took a rather pragmatic approach to the project, and Dunant, who was the visionary idealist among the five, and led to efforts by Moynier to attack Dunant and his bid for leadership.

In October 1863, 14 states took part in a meeting in Geneva organized by the committee to discuss the improvement of care for wounded soldiers. Dunant himself, however, was only a protocol leader because of Moynier's efforts to diminish his role. A year later on 22 August 1864, a diplomatic conference organized by the [[Swiss Parliament]] led to the signing of the [[First Geneva Convention]] by 12 states. Dunant, again, was only in charge of organizing accommodation for the attendees.

== Forgotten period ==
Dunant's businesses in Algeria had suffered, partially because of his devotion to his humanistic ideals. In April 1867, the bankruptcy of the financial firm ''Crédit Genevois'' led to a scandal involving Dunant. He was forced to declare bankruptcy and was condemned by the Geneva Trade Court on 17 August 1868 for deceptive practices in the bankruptcies. Due to their investments in the firm, his family and many of his friends were also heavily affected by the downfall of the company. The social outcry in Geneva, a city deeply rooted in Calvinist traditions, also led to calls for him to separate himself from the International Committee. On 25 August 1868, he resigned as Secretary and, on 8 September, he was fully removed from the Committee. Moynier, who had become President of the Committee in 1864, played a major role in his expulsion.

In February 1868, Dunant's mother died. Later that year he was expelled from the YMCA.{{why|date=July 2017}} In March 1867, he left his home city Geneva and would not return for the rest of his life. In the following years, Moynier likely used his influence to attempt to ensure that Dunant would not receive assistance and support from his friends. For example, the gold medal prize of ''Sciences Morales'' at the Paris World's Fair did not go to Dunant as originally planned but to Moynier, Dufour, and Dunant together so that the prize money would only go to the Committee as a whole. Napoléon III's offer to take over half of Dunant's debts if Dunant's friends would secure the other half was also thwarted by Moynier's efforts.

Dunant moved to Paris, where he lived in meager conditions. However, he continued to pursue his humanitarian ideas and plans. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–1871), he founded the Common Relief Society (''Allgemeine Fürsorgegesellschaft'') and soon after the Common Alliance for Order and Civilization (''[[Allgemeine Allianz für Ordnung und Zivilisation]]''). He argued for disarmament negotiations and for the erection of an international court to mediate international conflicts. Later he worked for the creation of a world library, an idea which had echoes in future projects such as [[UNESCO]].

In his continued pursuit and advocacy of his ideas, he further neglected his personal situation and income, falling further in [[debt]] and being shunned by his acquaintances. Despite being appointed an honorary member of the national Red Cross societies of Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, [[Prussia]] and Spain, he was nearly forgotten in the official discourse of the Red Cross Movement, even as it was rapidly expanding to new countries. He lived in poverty, moving to various places between 1874 and 1886, including [[Stuttgart]], Rome, [[Corfu]], [[Basel]], and [[Karlsruhe]]. In Stuttgart he met the [[Tübingen University]] student Rudolf Müller with whom he would have a close friendship. In 1881, together with friends from Stuttgart, he went to the small Swiss resort village [[Heiden AR|Heiden]] for the first time. In 1887 while living in London, he began to receive some monthly financial support from some distant family members. This enabled him to live a somewhat more secure existence, and he moved to Heiden in July. He spent the rest of his life there, and after 30 April 1892 he lived in a hospital and nursing home led by Dr. Hermann Altherr.

In Heiden, he met the young teacher Wilhelm Sonderegger and his wife Susanna; they encouraged him to record his life experiences. Sonderegger's wife founded a branch of the Red Cross in Heiden and in 1890 Dunant became its honorary president. With Sonderegger, Dunant hoped to further promote his ideas, including publishing a new edition of his book. However, their friendship later was strained by Dunant's unjustified accusations that Sonderegger, with Moynier in Geneva, was somehow conspiring against Dunant. Sonderegger died in 1904 at the age of only forty-two. Despite their strained relationship, Dunant was deeply moved by the unexpected death. Wilhelm and Susanna Sonderegger's admiration for Dunant, felt by both even after Dunant's allegations, was passed on to their children. In 1935, their son René published a compilation of letters from Dunant to his father.

== Return to public memory ==
In September 1895, Georg Baumberger, the chief editor of the [[St. Gallen|St. Gall]] newspaper ''[[Die Ostschweiz]]'', wrote an article about the Red Cross founder, whom he had met and conversed with during a walk in Heiden a month earlier. The article entitled "Henri Dunant, the founder of the Red Cross", appeared in the German Illustrated Magazine ''Über Land und Meer'', and the article was soon reprinted in other publications throughout Europe. The article struck a chord, and he received renewed attention and support. He received the Swiss Binet-Fendt Prize and a note from Pope [[Leo XIII]]. Because of support from Russian [[tsar]]ist widow [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Feodorovna]] and other donations, his financial situation improved remarkably.

In 1897, Rudolf Müller, who was now working as a teacher in Stuttgart, wrote a book about the origins of the Red Cross, altering the official history to stress Dunant's role. The book also contained the text of ''[[A Memory of Solferino]]''. Dunant began an exchange of correspondence with [[Bertha von Suttner]] and wrote numerous articles and writings. He was especially active in writing about women's rights, and in 1897 facilitated the founding of a "Green Cross" women's organization whose only section was briefly active in Brussels.

== Nobel Peace Prize ==
[[File:Jean Henri Dunant.jpg|right|thumb|Dunant in 1901]]
In 1901, Dunant was awarded the first-ever [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his role in founding the International Red Cross Movement and initiating the Geneva Convention. By public and private means, Müller, and later Norwegian military physician [[Hans Daae]] (who had received a copy of Müller's book), advocated Dunant's case to the Nobel committee over the course of 4 years.&lt;ref name="Daae"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=ny77bPwKxaUC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates: An Illustrated Biographical History | publisher=Science History Publications/USA | author=Abrams, Irwin | authorlink=Irwin Abrams | year=2001 | pages=48 | isbn=0-8813-5388-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heudtlass"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/RC_Jun-1964.pdf | title=J. Henry Dunant and the events leading to the award of the first Nobel Peace Prize | author=Heudtlass, Willy | journal=[[International Review of the Red Cross]] | date=June 1964 | volume=4 | issue=39 | pages=287-}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award was jointly given to French pacifist [[Frédéric Passy]], founder of the Peace League and active with Dunant in the Alliance for Order and Civilization. The official congratulations which he received from the International Committee finally represented the rehabilitation of Dunant's reputation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is no man who more deserves this honour, for it was you, forty years ago, who set on foot the international organization for the relief of the wounded on the battlefield. Without you, the Red Cross, the supreme humanitarian achievement of the nineteenth century would probably have never been undertaken."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moynier and the International Committee as a whole had also been nominated for the prize. Although Dunant was supported by a broad spectrum in the selection process, he was still a controversial candidate. Some argued that the Red Cross and the Geneva Convention had made war more attractive and imaginable by eliminating some of its suffering. Therefore, Müller, in a letter to the committee, argued that the prize should be divided between Dunant and Passy, who for some time in the debate had been the leading candidate to be the sole recipient of the prize. Müller also suggested that if a prize were to be warranted for Dunant, it should be given immediately because of his advanced age and ill health.

By dividing the prize between Passy, a pacifist, and Dunant, a humanitarian, the Nobel Committee set a precedent for the conditions of the Nobel Peace Prize selection which would have significant consequences in later years. A section of Nobel's will had indicated that the prize should go to an individual who had worked to reduce or eliminate standing armies, or directly to promote peace conferences, which made Passy a natural choice for his peace work. On the other hand, the arguably distinct bestowal for humanitarian effort alone was seen by some as a wide interpretation of Nobel's will. However, another part of Nobel's testament marked the prize for the individual who had best enhanced the "brotherhood of people," which could be interpreted more generally as seeing humanitarian work like Dunant's as connected to peacemaking as well. Many recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize in later years can be assigned to either of these two categories first roughly established by the Nobel committee's decision in 1901.

Hans Daae succeeded in placing Dunant's part of the prize money, 104,000 Swiss Francs, in a Norwegian Bank and preventing access by his creditors. Dunant himself never spent any of the money during his lifetime, continuing to live simply and reserving it for bequests in his will to those who cared for him and charitable causes.&lt;ref name="Daae"/&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
[[Image:Grab Henry Dunant02.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Henry Dunant.]]

Among several other awards in the following years, in 1903 Dunant was given an honorary doctorate by the medical faculty of the [[University of Heidelberg]]. He lived in the nursing home in Heiden until his death. In the final years of his life, he suffered from depression and [[paranoia]] about pursuit by his creditors and Moynier. There were even days when Dunant insisted that the cook of the nursing home first taste his food before his eyes to protect him against possible poisoning. In his final years, he spurned and attacked Calvinism and [[organized religion]] generally. He was said to be agnostic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Unleashing of Evolutionary Thought |date=2007 |publisher=Vantage Press, Inc |isbn=9780533155972 |author=Oscar Riddle |page=343 |quote=The first Nobel Peace Prize went, in 1901, to Henri Dunant. Dunant was the founder of the Red Cross, but he could not become its first elective head–so it is widely believed–because of his agnostic views.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his nurses, the final act of his life was to send a copy of Müller's book to the Italian queen with a personal dedication. He died on 30 October 1910, and his final words were "Where has humanity gone?" He outlived his nemesis Moynier by just two months. Despite the ICRC's congratulations at the bestowal of the Nobel prize, the two rivals never reached a reconciliation.

According to his wishes, he was buried without ceremony in the [[Sihlfeld]] Cemetery in [[Zurich]]. In his will, he donated funds to secure a "free bed" in the Heiden nursing home always to be available for a poor citizen of the region and deeded some money to friends and charitable organizations in Norway and Switzerland. The remaining funds went to his creditors partially relieving his debt; his inability to fully erase his debts was a major burden to him until his death.

His birthday, 8 May, is celebrated as the World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day. The former nursing home in Heiden now houses the [[Henry Dunant Museum]]. In Geneva and other places there are numerous streets, squares, and schools named after him. The [[Henry Dunant Medal]], awarded every two years by the standing commission of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is its highest decoration.

'''Horst Paulmann Kemna''' (born 22 March 1935) is a German-Chilean [[billionaire]] entrepreneur.  He is founder and chairman of [[Cencosud]], the largest retail chain in Chile and the third largest in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://losandes.com.ar/article/santiago-no-le-teme-a-las-alturas| title=Santiago is not afraid of heights| date=23 August 2015| publisher=Los Andes| access-date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Forbes]]'', his fortune is estimated at US$4.8 billion, and the second richest man in Chile.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

==Early life==
In 1946, Horst Paulmann and his family, consisting of his parents and seven siblings, emigrated from Germany after the end of World War II. They crossed the Alps towards Italy, continued on to Argentina in 1948, and finally to Chile in 1950.&lt;ref name=Dinero&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dinero.com/edicion-impresa/negocios/articulo/el-rey-del-comercio/162515| title=The king trade| date=25 October 2012| publisher=Dinero| access-date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 13, Paulmann worked as a telephone operator in [[Buenos Aires]] and later worked making wooden toys. His family settled in the city of [[Temuco]] in the south of Chile, and his father got a position as a franchisee at Club Alemán and at Club de La Unión.&lt;ref name=Dinero/&gt; In 1952, Paulmann's family bought a local restaurant called Las Brisas and they soon transformed it into a supermarket. Since then and after the death of his father, Horst and his brother [[Jürgen Paulmann]] built a series of supermarket chains, beginning with the first hypermarket, located on Av. Kennedy. It measured 4,000 square meters and would become the foundation of the holding company [[Cencosud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-13198715| title=Horst Paulmann created Jumbo selling strawberries and walnuts| author=Sabine Drysdale| date=17 November 2013| publisher=El Tiempo| access-date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[Cencosud]] was founded by Horst Paulmann on 10 November 1978 when he assumed the role of CEO and chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/cencosud/| title=#1,040 Cencosud| publisher=Forbes| access-date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cen&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cencosud.com/inversionistas/corporate-governance| title=Gobierno Corporativo| publisher=Cencosud| access-date=29 December 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222093841/http://www.cencosud.com/inversionistas/corporate-governance/| archivedate=22 December 2015| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cencosud employs more than 150,000 people in Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Brazil and Peru, where it operates its supermarket chains (such as [[Jumbo (hypermarkets)|Jumbo]], [[Santa Isabel (supermarkets)|Santa Isabel]], [[Disco]], [[Vea]], Gbarbosa, Prezunic, Bretas, [[Perini (supermarket)|Perini]], [[Wong (supermarket)|Wong]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Tiendas Metro|es|3=Tiendas Metro|lt=Metro}}); department stores (such as [[París]] and Johnson's); home improvement stores (such as [[Easy (store)|Easy]] and Blaisten); commercial centers and credit stores (with over 4.3 million credit cards issued).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.americaeconomia.com/negocios-industrias/paulmann-versus-paulmann| title=Paulmann versus Paulmann| date=16 August 2010| publisher=America Economia| access-date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.economiaynegocios.cl/noticias/noticias.asp?id=89119| title=Horst Paulmann: "In Germany we reviewed jars trash Americans to eat..."| date=2 October 2011| author=Miranda Camila Krauss| publisher=Economia Y Negocios| access-date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dinero/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

'''IXSIR''' is a [[Lebanese wine]] company established in 2008. The [[winery]] is located just outside [[Batroun]], north [[Lebanon]].

The name is derived from the Arabic word for "[[elixir]]" (Al-Ikseer).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econostrum.info/Le-vin-libanais-en-effervescence_a2369.html Le vin libanais en effervescence]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Marc Quarin&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marc Quarin ''Le guide indépendant de l'amateur de vins de Bordeaux'' [http://www.quarin.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; awarded it "best grade for a Lebanese wine" at Bordeaux's ''La Semaine des Primeurs'' 09.

==History==
IXSIR entered the Lebanese market in 2010, under an exclusive distribution agreement with local gourmet food and beverage outlet ENOTECA.&lt;ref&gt;FLORENCE FABRICANT. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/dining/02beirut.html?_r=1 ''Dine&amp;Wine: Top Chefs and Restaurateurs Are Drawn to Beirut''], ''The New York Times'' magazine, June 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

IXSIR was one of only two Lebanese producers present at Bordeaux's famous "La Semaine des Primeurs", an event hosted exclusively for the evaluation and tasting of French and international wines.

The company was present at the Horeca Hospitality exhibition as one of ten producers to compete at the event’s first-ever wine pavilion with blind wine tasting contests. IXSIR was awarded the "Revelation of the Public" for its 2009 Grande Reserve White and the Media and Press award for its 2009 White.

On May 11, 2010, IXSIR joined the Union Vinicole du Liban (UVL)&lt;ref&gt;Vinicole du Liban (UVL), Lebanon's official association of wine producers [http://www.lebanonwines.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and participated in a wine tasting event held in Paris for international wine experts and professionals.

==Products==
The only Middle Eastern country without a desert, Lebanon’s topography is favorable for wine production as it consists of mountains, valleys, and coastal areas that are hospitable to many different grape varieties.&lt;ref&gt;Agence France Presse. [http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=3&amp;article_id=119060#axzz0ypvytdSy ''Lebanon's wine-makers keeping Bacchus alive''], ''The Daily Star'' magazine, September 07, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
IXSIR cultivates its wine [[grapes]] in several different zones, including Batroun in the North, [[Jezzine]] in the South, and the [[Bekaa Valley]] in the East.&lt;br&gt;IXSIR produces a wide spectrum of grape varieties, from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Syrah]], [[Tempranillo]], [[Caladoc]], and [[Viognier]], [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Muscat]], [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[Chardonnay]] and [[Sémillon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44224">'''Innovation leadership''' is a philosophy and technique that combines different leadership styles to influence employees to produce creative ideas, products, and services. The key role in the practice of innovation leadership is the innovation leader.&lt;ref&gt;Gliddon, D. G. (2006).

Forecasting a competency model for innovation leaders using a modified [[delphi technique]]. (Doctoral dissertation)&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. David Gliddon (2006) developed the competency model of innovation leaders and established the concept of innovation leadership at [[Penn State University]].

As an approach to organization development, innovation leadership can support achievement of the mission or the vision of an organization or group. With new technologies and processes, it is necessary for organizations to think innovatively to ensure continued success and stay competitive.&lt;ref name="Dess &amp; Pickens (2000)"&gt;Dess, G.

== Overview ==

To have a clear understanding of what innovation leadership involves, one must first understand the concept of [[innovation]]. Although there is some controversy over how it can be defined, through general consensus in the literature, it can be described as novel ideas of viable products that are put into operation.&lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery"&gt;Hunter, S.T., Cushenbery, L. (2011). Leading for innovation: Direct and indirect influences. Advances in Developing Human Resource, 13, 248-265&lt;/ref&gt; It includes three different stages, which are all dynamic and iterative (constant):

# Idea Generation
# Evaluation
# Implementation

The two types of innovation include exploratory innovation, which involves generating brand new ideas, and value-added innovation, which involves modifying and improving ideas that already exist.&lt;ref name="Benner, Tushman"&gt;Benner, M. J., &amp; [[Michael L. Tushman|Tushman, M. L.]] (2003). Exploitation, exploration, and process management: The productivity dilemma revisited. The Academy of Management Review, 238-256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansen, Van den Bosch, Volberda"&gt;Jansen, J. J. P., Van den Bosch, F. A. J., &amp; [[Volberda, H. W.]] (2006). Exploratory innovation, exploitative innovation, and performance: Effects of organizational antecedents and environmental :moderators. Management Science, 52, 1661−1674&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="March"&gt;March, J. G. (1991). Exploration and exploitation in organizational learning. Organization Science, 2, 71−87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosing, Frese &amp; Bausch"&gt;Rosing, K., Frese, M., &amp; Bausch, A. (2011). Explaining the heterogeneity of the leadership-innovation relationship: Ambidextrous leadership. The Leadership Quarterly, 22, 956-974&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas generated must be useful to be considered innovative. Innovation should also not be confused with [[creativity]], which is merely the generation of a novel idea that may not necessarily be put into operation—though these words are sometimes used interchangeably in research literature when speaking about innovation leadership. Innovation leadership is a complex concept, as there is no single explanation or formula for a leader to follow to increase innovation. As a result, innovation leadership encompasses a variety of different activities, actions, and behaviors that interact to produce an innovative outcome.

=== Value-added Innovation ===

Exploratory and value-added innovation require different leadership styles and behaviors to succeed.&lt;ref name="Jansen, Vera, &amp; Corssan" /&gt; Value-added innovation (PwC, 2010) involves refining and revising an existing product or service and typically requires minimal risk taking (compared to exploratory innovation, which often involves taking a large risk); in this case, it is most appropriate for a leader for innovation to adopt a transactional form of leadership.&lt;ref name="Jansen, Van den Bosch, Volberda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oke et al"&gt;Oke, A., Munshi, N., Walumbwa, F. O. (2009). The influence of leadership on innovation processes and activities. Organizational Dynamics, 38, 64-72&lt;/ref&gt; This is because a transactional leadership style does not use open leadership behaviors such as encouraging employees to experiment and take risks, but rather uses closed leadership behaviors that do not condone or reward risk-taking. Companies whose innovation leaders use transactional leadership for value-added innovation purposes include Toyota Motor Co., General Motors Corp., and Ford Motor Co.;&lt;ref name="Oke et al" /&gt; examples of these companies’ value-added innovations such as making improvements on existing cars by making them faster, more comfortable, and getting better gas mileage. 
 
Occasionally a value-added innovation may require a completely new way of thinking and possibly taking new risks. An example of this scenario can be illustrated through Aspirin; this was an existing product, traditionally used as an analgesic to alleviate aches and pains, but has been introduced into a new and different market by extending its uses to help prevent heart attack and reduce blot clot formation. In this example, the usage of an existing product was re-worked and introduced into a new market. While an existing product is being changed and/or improved upon, characterizing it as a value-added innovation, outside-the-box thinking, research, and risk-taking are now required since it is being introduced into a new market. In this case, a transformational leadership style is a more appropriate style to use.
 
The innovation leader must gauge if (and how much) risk and radical thinking are involved in the value-added innovation to determine which leadership style to use in a situation. The leader must be flexible—able to switch leadership behaviors when necessary.

=== Exploratory Innovation ===

Exploratory innovation refers to the generation of novel ideas, strategies, and solutions through the use of strictly open behaviors exhibited most often by transformational leaders. The foundation of exploratory innovation is characterized by search, discovery, experimentation, and risk taking. It is the organization's focus on generating new ideas, products and strategies; in contrast to exploitative innovation, which focuses on building and extending already existing ideas. Some studies have shown that explorative and exploitative innovation require different structures, strategies, processes, capabilities, and cultures.&lt;ref name="He, Wong"&gt;He, Z., Wong, P. (2004). Exploration vs. Exploitation: An empirical test of the ambidexterity hypothesis. Organization Science, 15, (4), 481-494&lt;/ref&gt; See Innovative Organizational Climate/Culture. Exploratory innovation requires flexibility, opportunism, adaptability, and for leaders to provide intellectual stimulation to their subordinates.&lt;ref name="Jansen, Van den Bosch, Volberda" /&gt; In this approach to innovation, the leadership style that is primarily used is transformational. The behaviors exhibited are believed to achieve the desired creative outcome from employees through the application of individualized consideration, charisma, and inspirational motivation.

For example, in one study of the innovation practices at AXA Insurance in Ireland, the CEO John O’Neil engaged in transformational leadership behaviors and introduced the “MadHouse” program that combined workers from different departments and levels of the organization to work together in a creative way. The result of this experiment after six months was 150 new business ideas for products and services.&lt;ref name="Oke 2002"&gt;Oke, A. (2002). Improving the innovative capability of a service company. Journal of Change Management, 2, (3), 272-281&lt;/ref&gt; Explorative and Value-added innovation are often referenced together, but surprisingly little research shows an interaction between the two. However, there is an understanding that in some circumstances a ‘balance’ must be attained to achieve superior employee performance.&lt;ref name="Tushman &amp; O'Rielly (1996)" /&gt; For example, not all novel ideas are implemented, and may be resurrected later. The organization may need to switch gears and adopt exploitative strategies to revise and refine the idea to match present needs.

== Foundations of Innovation Leadership ==

Innovation leadership has roots in [[path-goal theory]] and [[leader-member exchange theory]]. Certain elements within an organization are also needed for innovation leadership to succeeded. Wolfe (1994),&lt;ref name="Wolfe"&gt;Wolfe, R. (1994). Organizational innovation: Review, critique and suggested research directions. Journal of Management Studies, 31, 405-431&lt;/ref&gt; as cited by Sarros, Cooper, &amp; Santora, (2008)&lt;ref name="Sarros, Cooper, &amp; Santora (2008)" /&gt; has pointed out that one antecedent factor for innovation is [[organizational culture]]. Likewise, Isaksen, Laver, Ekvail &amp; Britz (2001) &lt;ref name="Isaksen, Lauer, Ekvail, &amp; Britz"&gt;Isaksen, S. G., Lauer, K. J., Ekvail, G., Britz, A., (2001). Perceptions of the best and worst climate for creativity: Preliminary validation evidence for the Situational Outlook Questionnaire. Creativity Research Journal, 13, (2), 171-184&lt;/ref&gt; concur that innovative endeavors fail without a supportive climate. This antecedent of a supportive organizational culture/climate encompasses encouragement of creativity, [[autonomy]], resources, and pressures. Additional foundational elements for innovation leadership include creative work, a creative workforce, and certain leader attributes.&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange"/&gt;

=== Roots in Path-Goal Theory ===

The basis of [[path-goal theory]] uses a similar view of leadership, in that it advocates different types of leadership (e.g., participative, supportive) behaviors, much like innovation leadership does. However, it is contingent on employee and environmental factor to be effective.&lt;ref name="House"&gt;House, R. J., (1996). Path-Goal theory of leadership: Lessons, legacy, and a reformulated theory. Leadership Quarterly, 7, (3), 323-352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, M. G., (1996). R. J. House’s “A Path-Goal Theory of Leader Effectiveness”. Leadership Quarterly, 7, (3), 305-309&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a single leader using different leadership behaviors originated in path-goal theory, and has been associated with the framework underlying innovation leadership, which also allows the creation of a work environment conducive to innovative thinking—which is the cognitive process of generating novel and useful ideas.

Creating this type of work environment through innovation leadership involves open leadership behaviors that resemble some leader behaviors proposed by Path-goal theory—for example, upward influence and supportive/considerate behaviors.&lt;ref name=House /&gt; In innovation leadership, these behaviors encourage the creative team to generate as many novel ideas as possible and lead to evaluation and implementation of these ideas.&lt;ref name="Jansen, Van den Bosch, Volberda" /&gt;

=== Roots in Leader-Member Exchange Theory ===

[[Leader-member exchange theory]] (LMX theory) is another one of the building blocks of innovation leadership. It follows the same idea as Path-goal theory and innovation leadership, that multiple leadership styles are necessary in managing multiple subordinates but takes it a step further. LMX involves adopting a unique leadership style for each employee. Past studies indicate that LMX theory has been shown to have an effect on innovation.&lt;ref name="Basu, Green"&gt;Basu, R., Green, S.G. (1997) Leader-member exchange and transformational leadership: An empirical examination of innovative behaviours in leader-member dyads. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 27, 477-99.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tierney, Farmer, &amp; Graen"&gt;Tierney, P., Farmer, S.M. and Graen, G.B. (1999), An examination of leadership and employee creativity: the relevance of traits and relationships, Personnel Psychology, 52, 591-620&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also shown that leader-member exchange relationships can predict significant organizational and attitudinal variables including higher job satisfaction and higher job performance.

Basu and Green (1997)&lt;ref name="Basu, Green" /&gt; found that innovative behavior is related to the quality of the leader-member exchange where high quality exchanges include contributions from both the leader and the follower. However, in a study by Jean Lee (2008),&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, J. (2008), Effects of leadership and leader-member exchange on innovativeness. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 23, (6), 670 – 6873&lt;/ref&gt; only the loyalty aspect of LMX (LMXL) was shown to be related to innovativeness. Leadership styles, transformational (positively related) and transactional (negatively related), were found to have an effect on innovativeness.

=== Innovative Organizational Culture/Climate ===

Some studies have shown evidence of organizational culture as the mediator of the relationship between transformational leadership and organizational innovation &lt;ref name="Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, Herron"&gt;Amabile, T. M., Conti, R., Coon, H., Lazenby, J., Herron, M. (1996) Assessing the work environment for creativity. The Academy of Management Journal, 39, (5), 1154-1184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deshpande, Farley, Webster"&gt;Deshpande, R., Farley, J., &amp; Webster, F. (1993). Corporate culture, customer orientation, and innovativeness in Japanese firms: A quadrad analysis. Journal of Marketing, 57, 23–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jassawalla, Sashittal"&gt;Jassawalla, A. R., &amp; Sashittal, H. C. (2002). Cultures that support product innovation processes. Academy of Management Executive, 16, 42-54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prather, Turrell"&gt;Prather, C. W., &amp; Turrell, M. C. (2002). Involve everyone in the innovation process. Research Technology Management,45,13-16.&lt;/ref&gt; and performance.&lt;ref name="Ogbonna &amp; Harris"&gt;Ogbonna, E., &amp; Harris, L. C. (2000). Leadership style, organizational culture and performance: Empirical evidence from UK companies. International Journal of Human Resource :Management, 11(4), 766-788&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xenikou &amp; Simosi"&gt;Xenikou, A., &amp; Simosi, M. (2006). Organizational culture and transformational leadership as predictors of business unit performance. Journal of Managerial Psychology,21(6),566-57&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, for transformational leadership to affect organizational innovation, an organization must have a strong innovative culture in addition to a leader with a [[transformational leadership]] style.

Organizational culture refers to an organization's deep structure, normative beliefs, and shared behavioral expectations. This culture is fairly constant and can influence interorganizational relations. Climate refers to the way that individuals perceive the extent to which the organizational culture impacts them. The two essentially are interrelated. One proposed model for assessing a creative environment in organizations includes the following dimensions:&lt;ref name="Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, Herron"/&gt;

==== Encouragement of Creativity ====

Encouragement of creativity is the most frequently mentioned dimension in the literature. It operates at three major levels, each level containing multiple aspects.

[[File:Conceptual Model Underlying Assessment of Perceptions of the Work Environment for Creativity, from Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, &amp; Heron (1996).png|thumbnail|Conceptual Model Underlying Assessment of Perceptions of the Work Environment for Creativity &lt;ref name="Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, Herron" /&gt;]]

==== Organizational Encouragement ====

The first level is Organizational Encouragement. This involves encouragement of risk-taking and idea generation from all levels of management, fair and supportive evaluation of new ideas, recognition and reward of creativity, and collaborative idea flow across an organization. Each of these are equally important aspects of organizational encouragement but the third aspect, recognition and reward of creativity, may have adverse effects if the sole purpose for engaging in an activity is to gain reward.

==== Supervisory Encouragement ====

The second level, Supervisory Encouragement, highlights the roles of supervisors and project managers in goal clarity, open interaction between supervisors and subordinates, and supervisory support of a team's work and ideas. This level of encouragement points to the concepts of transformational leadership and LMX that emphasise the importance of the interactions of supervisors and subordinates in innovative performance.

==== Work Group Encouragement ====

The third level of encouragement is Work Group Encouragement. Diversity in team members’ backgrounds and openness to ideas affects creativity because individuals are exposed to a variety of novel and unusual ideas and such exposure had been demonstrated to have a positive effect on creative thinking &lt;ref name="Parnes &amp; Noller"&gt;Parnes, S. J., &amp; Noller, R. B. (1972). Applied creativity: The creative studies project-Part II: Results of the two-year program. Journal of Creative Behavior, 6, 164-186&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Autonomy ====

Autonomy is believed to foster creativity since studies have revealed that individuals produce more creative work and experience increased intrinsic motivation when they have a sense of control and ownership over their work and ideas and they perceive themselves as having a choice in how their goals are accomplished, whether those goals are given to them by their supervisor or chosen by themselves.

==== Resources ====

Resources have been suggested to be directly related to creativity in organizations. Individuals’ perceptions of the availability of resources may lead to increased beliefs of the likelihood that the ideas they generate have a possibility of reaching the implementation stage.

==== Pressures ====

The little evidence that exists on the dimension of pressure suggests somewhat paradoxical influences. Some degree of pressure could have a positive effect if the pressure originates from the challenging and intellectual nature of the task itself, increasing intrinsic motivation. However, if the pressure experienced is perceived extreme it could counteract creativity. Amabile et al. (1996) &lt;ref name="Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, Herron"/&gt; identify two forms of pressure: excessive workload pressure and challenge. They suggest that the first should have a negative influence on creativity while the second should have a positive one.

==== Organizational Impediments to Creativity ====

Although there has been little research on the work of environment factors that undermine creativity, some research suggests that these impediments include internal strife, conservatism, and rigid, formal management structures within organizations.&lt;ref name="Kimberley"&gt;36.	Kimberley, J. R. (1981). Managerial innovation. In P. C. Nystrom &amp; W. H. Starbuck (Eds.), Hand-book of organizational design: 84-104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimberley, Evanisko"&gt;Kimberley, J. R., &amp; Evanisko, M. J. (1981). Organizational innovation: The influence of individual, organizational and contextual factors on hospital adoption of technological and administrative innovations. Academy of Management Journal, 24, 689-713&lt;/ref&gt; This dimension is seen as working against autonomy and tends to have an inverse effect as individuals may perceive a more controlling environment.&lt;ref name="Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, Herron"/&gt;

=== Creative Work ===

Creative work can occur at any job but more specifically it can occur in jobs where there are complicated, ill-defined problems requiring innovative solutions.&lt;ref name="Besemer &amp; O’Quin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mumford &amp; Gustafson, 1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward, Smith, &amp; Finke" /&gt; The fact that the creative problems are ill-defined makes the creative work uncertain, and it may involve risky efforts.&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange" /&gt; It is also resource intensive, demanding, and time consuming work&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange" /&gt; requiring high levels of motivation &lt;ref name="Collins, Amabile"&gt;Collins, M. A., &amp; Amabile, T. M. (1999). Motivation and creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity, 297–312. Cambridge, England: Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pelz &amp; Andrews"&gt;Pelz, D. C., &amp; Andrews, F. M. (1966). Autonomy, coordination, and simulation in relation to scientific achievement.

Creativity Research Journal, 8, 205 – 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cagliano, Chiesa, &amp; Manzini"&gt;Cagliano, R., Chiesa, V., &amp; Manzini, R. (2000).

In R. J. Sternberg, &amp; J. E. Davidson (Eds.), The nature of insight (pp. 365 – 396 ). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; This type of work must also involve both novel idea generation and novel idea implementation &lt;ref name="Vincent, Decker &amp; Mumford"&gt;Vincent, A. H., Decker, B. D., &amp; Mumford, M. D. (2002). Divergent thinking, intelligence, and expertise: a test of alternative models. Creativity Research Journal, 14, 163 – 178&lt;/ref&gt; and requires expertise on the part of the workforce.&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange" /&gt;

=== Creative Workforce ===

A creative workforce is needed for innovation leadership to be successful. Creative people have expertise on the subject requiring innovation and tend to use work as a source of identity.&lt;ref name="Rostan"&gt;Rostan, S. M. (1998). A study of young artists: the emergence of artistic and creative identity. Journal of Creative Behavior, 32, 278-301. Creativity Research Handbook: Volume II. Cresskill, :NJ: Hampton&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, they are powerfully intrinsically motivated by professional achievement opportunities and recognition. Creative workers are also commonly characterized as highly valuing their autonomy; additional dispositional attributes include openness, flexibility, cognitive complexity, self-confidence, dominance, and [[introversion]].&lt;ref name="Fiest, 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiest &amp; Gorman"&gt;Fiest, G. J., &amp; Gorman, M. E. (1998). The psychology of science: Review and integration of a nascent discipline. Review of General Psychology, 2, 3–47&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns of characteristics creative workers exhibit typically allow them to confidently explore alternative ideas under ambiguous conditions.&lt;ref name="Mumford &amp; Gustafson, 1988" /&gt;

=== Leader Attributes/Characteristics ===

Successful innovation leadership requires a leader with certain characteristics. These include expertise in the domain, creativity, ability to carry out transformational leadership behaviors, planning and sense-making, and social skills.&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange" /&gt; Innovative leaders can be recruited and hired through professional networks and referrals or alternatively found through succession planning, which involves identifying innovative leaders who are already working within the organization.&lt;ref name="McEntire &amp; Green-Shortridge (2011)" /&gt;

== Types of Innovation Leadership Styles ==

In addition to these foundations, various &lt;ref&gt;leadership&lt;/ref&gt; styles play an important role in innovation leadership, each of which are used at different stages of the innovation process or for different types of innovation (value-added vs. exploratory). Frequently associated leadership styles include transformational leadership,&lt;ref name="Rosing, Frese &amp; Bausch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chen, Lin, Lin, &amp; McDonough III"&gt;Chen, M. Y., Lin, C. Y., Lin, H., McDonough III, E. F. (2012). Does transformational leadership facilitate technological innovation? The moderating roles of innovative culture and incentive compensation. Asia Pacific Journal of Management, 29, 239-264&lt;/ref&gt; [[transactional leadership]],&lt;ref name="Jansen, Vera, &amp; Corssan"&gt;Jansen, J. J. P., Vera, D., &amp; Crossan, M. (2009).

A., &amp; Ritossa, D. A. (2007). The impact of goal orientation on the association between leadership style and follower performance, creativity and work attitudes.

R&amp;D Management, 39, (1), 2137&lt;/ref&gt; and Ambidextrous leadership.&lt;ref name="Rosing, Frese &amp; Bausch" /&gt; The type of leadership most strongly associated with innovation is transformational leadership.&lt;ref name="Rosing, Frese &amp; Bausch" /&gt;

== Key Activities of Innovation Leadership ==

=== Idea Generation ===

As mentioned above, different leadership styles and behaviors may be more appropriate at different stages of the innovation process. Current research supports the notion that in the idea generation process, innovation leadership requires a leader to use a more transformational style of leadership.&lt;ref name="King &amp; Anderson"&gt;King, N., &amp; Anderson, N. (1990). Innovation in working groups. In M. A. West, &amp; J. L. Farr (Eds.), Innovation and creativity at work, 81–100&lt;/ref&gt; During this stage, a leader needs to promote a safe environment for employees/team members to voice novel ideas and original thinking as well as provide workers with the resources to do so effectively.&lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery" /&gt; Research has also found that leaders who engage in unconventional behaviors, associated with transformational leadership, were seen as stronger role models and, as a result, increase creative performance in their subordinates. For example, the founders of Google have been known to wear capes and jump-shoes around the office,&lt;ref name="Schmidt, 2010"&gt;Schmidt, E. (2010, May). How I did it: Google’s CEO on enduring lessons of a quirky IPO.  Harvard Business Review. Retrieved from http://hbr.org/2010/05/how-i-did-it-googles-ceo-on-the-enduring-lessons-of-a-quirky-ipo/ar/1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vise &amp; Malseed" /&gt; thus inspiring more outside-the-box thinking in their employees. These open leadership behaviors convey that unorthodox and unconventional ideas and behaviors are not only accepted but also encouraged.

=== Idea Evaluation and Implementation ===

In addition to providing a climate for idea generation, innovation leadership also requires leaders to ensure that the process of idea generation does not overshadow the evaluation and implementation processes. During these phases of leadership, leaders must support some ideas while discarding other ideas and put the supported ideas into production. The role of the leader must shift away from a transformational style to a more transactional style of leadership, which involves being more direct and critical toward the ideas generated. A leader now needs to ensure that constructive discussions of innovative ideas are taking place among their subordinates. This serves to evaluate the usefulness of each idea, eliminate those that do not appear viable to the organization or goal, and push the ones that do appear viable into the production phase. The leader must adopt what are known as closed leadership behaviors to achieve this. Instead of stimulating idea generation, the leader must shift focus from generating new ideas toward fine-tuning existing ideas to achieve progress toward the goal, and ultimately implement the idea. This challenge of balancing differing leadership styles when appropriate is called the ''generator evaluator paradox''. It is important to consider the role of ambidextrous leadership, since a leader must be able to switch between leadership roles and styles when necessary to successfully lead for innovation. Paradoxes of innovation leadership are discussed below.

== Innovation Leadership and Influence ==

Depending on the type of leadership style that is adopted by the innovation leader, the leader may have either a direct or indirect influence on your employees.

=== Direct Influences ===

Direct forms of influence in leading innovation include:
* providing creative input and idea suggestion to employees
* providing employees with clear and concrete goals
* allocating organizational resources (i.e. research and development spending; manpower) for implementing ideas

=== Indirect Influences ===

Indirect influences get the same results without providing explicit guidance to employees. These types of influences include:
* establishing a supportive climate for creativity within the organization
* acting as a role model for innovative thinking
* providing employees with rewards and recognition for innovative thinking
* hiring and team composition (i.e. putting together teams with specific skill sets needed for innovative thinking, or hiring employees with creative personalities without planning what they work on).

== Proposed Model for Innovation Leadership ==

A proposed model for innovation leadership has been a multilevel process model of innovation,&lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery" /&gt; which uses the direct and indirect leadership on the processes of innovation mentioned in the above section to promote the innovation process. In the model, indirect leadership influences affect the individual creativity (generation phase) and team creativity (evaluation phase) process. Direct leadership influences affect the team creativity (evaluation phase) process and the organizational innovation process (implementation phase). The individual creativity (generation phase) box in the model represents the process of the individual generating the initial idea or ideas and proposing them to their team. The team creativity (evaluation phase) box represents the process of the team taking that idea, making alterations and fine-tuning it to the point of making prototypes, formalized sketches, or simulations. The organizational innovation (implementation) box represents taking those [[prototypes]], sketches, or simulations and testing, evaluating, and possibly mass-producing them.

[[File:Figure 1. Model of direct and indirect leadership influences on the process of innovation, from Hunter &amp; Cushenberry (2011).png|thumbnail|Figure 1. Model of direct and indirect leadership influences on the process of innovation &lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery" /&gt;]]

Two very important key features of this model should be mentioned:
# The three stages of innovation (idea generation, evaluation, and implementation) are not independent of one another.
# The stages in the model should not be viewed in a “lock-step fashion,” meaning that there are both backward and forward influences and activities affecting each of the three stages. For example, ideas are generated, discussed, and tested only to feed information back into the system, starting the process from the beginning again.&lt;ref name="Finke, Ward, &amp; Smith, 1992"&gt;Finke, R. A., Ward, T. B., &amp; Smith, S. M. (1992). Creative cognition: Theory, research, and applications. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The forward and backward arrows between individual creativity and team creativity, the forward and backward arrows between team creativity and organizational innovation, as well as the arrow from organizational innovation to individual creativity visually represent this key feature.

== Paradoxes of Innovation Leadership ==

Innovation leadership is complex, as can be seen from the Hunter &amp; Cushenbery (2011) model,&lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery" /&gt; and often [[paradoxes]] emerge that require leaders to strike a delicate balance between two conflicting roles (e.g. encouraging innovative ideas vs. limiting innovative ideas to include only those that are most viable and useful to the organization). A balance must be struck, not only within the leader and their behaviors, but between conflicting interests of involved parties as well. These include conflicting interests between the leader and the employees/teams, between leaders and situational/contextual factors, and between the employees/teams and the organization. Critical potential paradoxes that are often faced by leaders of innovation have been provided by Hunter, Thoroughgood, Meyer, &amp; Ligon (2011).&lt;ref name="Hunter, Thoroughgood &amp; Myer" /&gt;

=== Internal/Localized Paradox ===

Internal/Localized paradoxes entail conflicting roles experienced within the leader.

=== Dual Expertise Paradox ===

The Dual Expertise Paradox postulates that a leader must have or acquire domain expertise while at the same time obtaining the necessary leadership skills to manage his/her employees and resources.

=== Generation Evaluation Paradox ===

The Generation Evaluation Paradox stipulates that a leader must encourage a supportive climate for the generation of new ideas and thinking outside-the-box while evaluating these ideas and realizing that not all creative ideas are useful and many may even fail (while not being too critical and negative of those ideas).

=== Team-level Paradox ===

Team-level paradoxes entail conflicting interests between the leader and the employees/teams

=== Creative Personality Cohesion Paradox ===

Creative Personality Cohesion Paradox is based on the research finding that creative workers generally highly value autonomy &lt;ref name="Fiest, 1999"&gt;Fiest, G. J. (1999). The influence of personality on artistic and scientific creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 273 – 296). Cambridge, England: Cambridge University: Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiest &amp; Gorman" /&gt; and, as a result, often prefer to work alone. This paradox illustrates the difficulty leaders have in providing their employees with the autonomy they must be creative, while fostering team cohesion (or closeness) to facilitate idea sharing. A leader must also be careful not to encourage too much cohesion, as it may discourage group members from disagreeing (even constructively disagreeing) with fellow group members in an effort not to offend them or “rock the boat.”

=== Vision Autonomy Paradox ===

The Vision Autonomy Paradox highlights the dilemma a leader faces between providing structure and guidance to a team with respect to the vision of the goal, while at the same time stepping back and providing the team with enough autonomy, especially considering the fact that creative workers highly value autonomy. When leading for innovation, providing an overabundance of structure may result in a backlash from employees who feel their autonomy is being taken away from them.

=== Restriction Freedom Paradox ===

The Restriction Freedom Paradox underscores that innovation leaders need to allow employees enough time to develop creative endeavors and provide the resources to do so. At the same time the leader must take care to provide enough pressure that they are still motivated to complete the task &lt;ref name="Hunter, Thoroughgood &amp; Myer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shalley &amp; Gilson"&gt;Shalley, C. E., &amp; Gilson, L. L. (2004). What leaders need to know: A review of the social and contextual factors that can foster or hinder creativity. The Leadership Quarterly, 15, 33–53.&lt;/ref&gt; and not provide too many resources that it has a “deadening effect” on creativity.&lt;ref name="Csikszentmihalyi"&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, M. (1997). Creativity: Flow and the psychology of discovery and intervention. New York: Harper Collins Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Situational Paradox ===

Situational Paradoxes entail conflicting interests between leaders and the situations they face.

=== Intrinsic Extrinsic Paradox ===

The Intrinsic Extrinsic Paradox holds that instead of providing more readily available extrinsic motivation tools such as bonuses and salary increases, leaders must provide intrinsic motivation, which generally comes from within the employee, to their employees. This paradox is based on findings that intrinsic motivation is a key factor in facilitating creativity &lt;ref name="Amabile, 1997"&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1997). Motivating creativity in organizations: On doing what you love and loving what you do. California Management Review, 40, 39 –58., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shalley &amp; Oldham"&gt;Shalley, C. E., &amp; Oldham, G. R. (1997). Competition and creative performance: Effects of competitor presence and visibility. Creativity Research Journal, 10, 337–345.&lt;/ref&gt; and extrinsic motivators may either hinder creativity &lt;ref name="Amabile, 1985"&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1985). Motivation and creativity: Effects of motivational orientation on creative writers. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 48, 393–399.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kruglanksi, Friedman &amp; Zeeyi, 1971"&gt;Kruglanski, A. W., Friedman, I., &amp; Zeeyi, G. (1971). The effects of extrinsic incentive on some qualitative aspects of task performance. Journal of Personality, 39, 606 – 617.&lt;/ref&gt; or have an unclear relationship with creativity.&lt;ref name="Baer, Oldham, &amp; Cummings, 2003"&gt;Baer, M., Oldham, G. R., &amp; Cummings, A. (2003). Rewarding creativity: When does it really matter? The Leadership Quarterly, 14, 569 –586.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mumford &amp; Hunter, 2005"&gt;47.	Mumford, M. D., &amp; Hunter, S. T. (2005). Innovation in organizations: A multi-level perspective on creativity. In F. J. Yammarino &amp; F. Dansereau (Eds.), Research in multi-level issues, 5, 11–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Local Long-Term Paradox ===

The Local Long-Term Paradox posits that leaders of innovation must maintain their innovative edge by keeping an eye out for and capitalizing on potential opportunities, even at the risk of placing those ideas above or even eliminating ideas that he or she had previously inspired in their teams. The leader must also be capable of developing teams that are flexible enough to be passionate about ideas that may have replaced their own idea that was facilitated, inspired, and supported by their leader. This is where the paradox is most clearly visible.&lt;ref name="Hunter, Thoroughgood &amp; Myer"&gt;Hunter, S. T., Thoroughgood, C. N., Myer, A. T., &amp; Ligon, G. S. (2011). Paradoxes of leading innovative endeavors: Summary, Solutions, and Future Directions. Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts, 5, 54-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competition Collaboration Paradox ===

The [[competition collaboration paradox]] involves a leader developing open external relationships with other organizations to discover potential innovation opportunities, while ensuring the organization's emerging ideas are protected in a competitive environment.

=== Feedback Rigidity Paradox ===

The [[feedback rigidity paradox]] involves leaders seeking out and using customer and client advice and feedback towards innovative endeavors to a certain extent, while maintaining control of the vision and not letting the feedback dictate to them—as clients and customers often criticize innovations early on.

=== Failure Success Paradox ===

The Failure Success Paradox is the idea that innovation leaders must ensure a safe organizational culture that is willing to embrace risk and failure, while at the same time making sure that the organization is also producing successful products and services despite embracing risk and errors.

=== Additional Paradoxes ===

Additional paradoxes identified by Hunter et al. (2011) that do not directly involve the leader but are worth mentioning are the paradoxes that occur between teams and the organization. These include the Insularity Cohesion paradox, the Champion Evaluator paradox, and the Creativity Cost paradox.&lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery" /&gt;

== Outcomes ==

Outcomes of innovation leadership include inspiring employees to the create and implement novel ideas for products, services, and technologies. In addition, these novel ideas can also be used to solve problems within an organization. What this illustrates is that innovation spurred by innovation leadership can be translated across various industries and can be used for a multitude of purposes.&lt;ref name="Besemer &amp; O’Quin"&gt;Besemer, S. P., O’Quin, K. (1999). Confirming the three-factor creative product analysis matrix model in an American sample. Creativity Research Journal, 12, 287 – 296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;Ford, C. M. (2000). Creative developments in creativity theory. Academy of Management Review, 25, 284 – 289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mumford &amp; Gustafson, 1988"&gt;Mumford, M. D., &amp; Gustafson, S. B. (1988). Creativity syndrome: integration, application, and innovation. Psychological Bulletin, 103, 27 – 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward, Smith, &amp; Finke"&gt;Ward, T. B., Smith, S. M., &amp; Finke, R. A. (1999). Creative cognition. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity, 189 – 213. Cambridge, England: Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, inspiring and initiating organizational innovation through innovation leadership can serve to advance the organization it to the next level.&lt;ref name="McEntire &amp; Green-Shortridge (2011)" /&gt;

== Real-World Examples of Innovation Leadership ==

Companies that use innovative leadership include 3M, which lets employees work on a project of their choosing for 15% of their time.&lt;ref name="Kanter, R. M., Kao, J., &amp; Wiersema, F."&gt;Kanter, R. M., Kao, J., &amp; Wiersema, F. (1997). Innovation: Breakthrough thinking at 3M, DuPont, GE, Pfizer, and Rubbermaid. New York, NY: HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Google allows employees one day a week to work on their own project.&lt;ref name="Vise &amp; Malseed"&gt;Vise, D. A., &amp; Malseed, M. (2005). The Google story: Inside the hottest business, media, and technology success of our time. New York, NY: Bantam Dell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappos employees are allowed to “radically” decorate their cubicle and are encouraged to laugh and have fun at work impromptu in-office parades.&lt;ref name="Thorton"&gt;Thorton, P. B. (2010). Leadership: Off the wall. Bloomington, IN: WestBow Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''KlickEx''' is a [[Polynesia]]n payments system for low value electronic [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] transactions using an [[Interbank foreign exchange market|interbank]] [[smart market]] retail system.  It provides low cost electronic foreign exchange [[Clearing (finance)|clearing]] services to clients in the [[Pacific Islands]] avoiding the usual foreign transfer fees and [[Bid–offer spread|spreads]] by matching up individuals sending payments to and from the islands.

Payments can be made between the Pacific Islands and Australia, New Zealand and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.klickex.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The system also allows users to transfer directly to [[Mobile payment|mobile wallets]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fletcher|first=Hamish|title=Tech firm scores Pacific money transfer deal|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/connect/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501833&amp;objectid=10757041|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bank accounts.

The system is an electronic alternative to informal [[Hawala]] systems, traditional [[Electronic funds transfer|international bank transfers]] and older [[remittance]] networks where the minimum transfer fees would often make it uneconomical to send low value payments that are typical for [[migrant worker]]s and relatives of the island communities.

The company has won a number of awards and support from NZ government development agencies for providing a service that enables rapid low value payments [[cross-border|Foreign Exchange]] a lower cost, and reaching a much larger number of impoverished (but vibrant) communities in the South Pacific islands.

==History==
The company name is derived from the title: ''The Klick Exchange Trading Company''.  The company was resident of the [[ICEHOUSE (incubator)|ICE-house incubator]] innovation centre in Auckland.

The KlickEx system is based on trading technology that has been operational since 2002.

Through a regional partnership with the [[United Nations Development Program]], and the Australian and New Zealand Governments in 2011; KlickEx continued to build services and by providing the platform for Mobile Carriers ([[MNO]]) to integrate mobile wallet platforms into the established banking system; thereby accelerating the penetration of financial services to the [[unbanked]] in the [[Pacific]], particularly focusing on Rural communities, and [[financial inclusion]] for women in developing economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pfip.org/media-centre/press-releases/digicel-klickex-launch-web-to-mobile-wallet-remittance-transfer.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502190010/http://www.pfip.org/media-centre/press-releases/digicel-klickex-launch-web-to-mobile-wallet-remittance-transfer.html |archivedate=2012-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the company was a finalist for several New Zealand Hi-Tech Awards, in several categories including [[Ministry of Science and Innovation]] Start-up of the Year, Best New Software, Best New Service (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title =2012 NZ Hi-Tech Awards Finalists
 | publisher =The New Zealand Hi-Tech Trust
 | url =http://www.hitech.org.nz/finalists.html
 | accessdate = 1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the company won several international awards, including The Financial World Innovation Awards and [[SWIFT]]'s Innotribe Award (see below for results).

==Services==
The company has three core divisions: A retail operation, providing payment services in the South Pacific, www.KlickEx.com, an Institutional operation, connecting smaller banks to regional and world-wide clearing networks, VOSnet www.KlickEx.net, and [[NGO]]/Development operations, providing regulators and government agencies with statistical and compliance solutions, www.KlickEx.org.

The company provides three core products to participants:
* An open access [[Private electronic market]] for multi-currency settlements.  The micro-currency system provides members the facility to move both ultra-low-value and high-value quantities of foreign exchange through the foreign exchange markets, without traditional FX margins.
* multi-regional clearing, verification, and order forwarding, this allows the proceeds of multi-currency settlements to be forwarded on electronically at bank-bank exchange rates, providing end users efficient access to overhead-free FX rates.
* cashflow tracking services and wealth management systems enable enhanced transparency and consumer security across a multi-currency platform.

KlickEx operates a [[straight-through processing]] settlement system that enables individuals and partnership banks to gain access to cross-border foreign currency clearing facilities and rapid settlement between accounts, delivering cleared funds across currencies in seconds. The system micro-manages standing orders for foreign exchange as little as NZ$1.00.  With retail clients in New Zealand, Australia, Tonga and Samoa having immediate access following a short approval and [[Anti-money laundering]] process.

[[Burmese name#Honorifics|U]] '''Kyaw Myint''' ({{lang-my|ကျော်မြင့်}};born c. 1945) also known as '''May Flower Kyaw Win''' is a noted [[Burma|Burmese]] businessman and political figure. He is one of the wealthiest tycoons in Burma and is one of the country's leading industrialists and bankers.&lt;ref name="Irrawaddy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/print_article.php?art_id=1924|title=Burmese Tycoons Part II|publisher=[[The Irrawaddy]]|date=July 2000|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the director-general of the Directorate of Industry under the Ministry of Industry of Burma.

==Biography==
He was born into a poor [[Burmese Chinese|Chinese]] family in a small village in northern [[Shan State]]. However, in 1968, when he was in his 20s, Kyaw Win worked in the border town of [[Tachilek]], where he established business relationships with Thai businessmen. One of them was the notorious Thai logging tycoon, [[Choon Tangkakarn]], owner of [[Pathumthani Sawmills]].&lt;ref name="Irrawaddy"/&gt;

Since 1990, Kyaw Win has managed in the timber business and in 1994, he established [[Myanmar May Flower Bank]], the third biggest in Burma with ten branches of which he is the chairman.&lt;ref name="Irrawaddy"/&gt; It was the first bank in Burma to have 24-hour automatic teller machines also was the first to introduce computer networks for transactions back in November 1995.&lt;ref name="Irrawaddy"/&gt; In 1998, Aik Hok and Win Naing bought a large number of shares in May Flower Bank from Kyaw Win, and since then the bank’s activities have declined.&lt;ref name="Irrawaddy"/&gt;

Kyaw Win is also involved in the following associations and businesses. He is Managing Director of Chin-Su Co, Ltd; Chairman of Chin-Su May Flower Plywood Industry; Chairman of TN Resources Pte Co, Ltd (Singapore); Chairman, of Pathum Thani Saw Mill Co, Ltd, (Thailand); and Managing Director of [[Yangon Airways]].&lt;ref name="Irrawaddy"/&gt; He has connections with the [[Asian Development Bank]] and important top ranking government officials, including General [[Maung Aye]].&lt;ref name="Irrawaddy"/&gt;

In 2004 he negotiated the building of a series of new pulp factories across several states of Burma including in [[Ponnagyun]] in [[Rakhine State]] which will consume nearly 900,000 tonnes of bamboo a year, and [[Thabaung]] township in [[Ayeyarwady Division]] which will begin commercial production at 200 tonnes a year and several other areas. The decision was part of a bilateral cooperation plan between the Ministry of Industry in Burma and [[China Metallurgical Construction Corporation]] signed during the visit of General [[Khin Nyunt]], to China from July 11 to 17 in which U Kyaw Myint was also a member of the delegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no229/MyanmarTimes12-229/015.htm|title=Factories boost pulp production|publisher=[[The Myanmar Times]]|date=March 2004|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to Opium Production==
Kyaw Myint is allegedly the head of the Chinese-staffed and Burma Army-supported People Militia Force (Bi Thu Sit or Ta Ka Sa Pha), an organization that oversees the production and trafficking of opium and heroin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freeburmarangers.org/2014/03/17/opium-logging-and-gas-the-burma-armys-predatory-rule-over-the-people-of-burma/&lt;/ref&gt;  Myint is behind the rise in opium production in Myanmar's Shan State since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.irrawaddy.org/print_article.php?art_id=22322&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7834">In [[statistics]], a '''latent class model''' ('''LCM''') relates a set of observed (usually discrete) [[multivariate random variable|multivariate]] variables to a set of [[latent variable]]s. It is a type of [[latent variable model]]. It is called a latent class model because the latent variable is discrete. A class is characterized by a pattern of [[conditional probabilities]] that indicate the chance that variables take on certain values.

'''Latent class analysis''' ('''LCA''') is a subset of [[structural equation modeling]], used to find groups or subtypes of cases in multivariate categorical data. These subtypes are called "latent classes".&lt;ref name="Lazarsfeld"&gt;Lazarsfeld, P.F. and Henry, N.W. (1968) ''Latent structure analysis''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton K. Formann|Formann]], A. K. (1984). ''Latent Class Analyse: Einführung in die Theorie und Anwendung [Latent class analysis: Introduction to theory and application]''. Weinheim: Beltz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confronted with a situation as follows, a researcher might choose to use LCA to understand the data: Imagine that symptoms a-d have been measured in a range of patients with diseases X Y and Z, and that disease X is associated with the presence of symptoms a, b, and c, disease Y with symptoms b, c, d, and disease Z with symptoms a, c and d.

The LCA will attempt to detect the presence of latent classes (the disease entities), creating patterns of association in the symptoms. As in factor analysis, the LCA can also be used to classify case according to their [[maximum likelihood]] class membership.&lt;ref name="Lazarsfeld"/&gt;

Because the criterion for solving the LCA is to achieve latent classes within which there is no longer any association of one symptom with another (because the class is the disease which causes their association), and the set of diseases a patient has (or class a case is a member of) causes the symptom association, the symptoms will be "conditionally independent", i.e., conditional on class membership, they are no longer related.&lt;ref name="Lazarsfeld"/&gt;

== Model ==
Within each latent class, the observed variables are [[statistically independent]]. This is an important aspect. Usually the observed variables are statistically dependent. By introducing the latent variable, independence is restored in the sense that within classes variables are independent ([[local independence]]). We then say that the association between the observed variables is explained by the classes of the latent variable (McCutcheon, 1987).

In one form, the latent class model is written as
:  &lt;math&gt;p_{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_N} \approx \sum_t^T p_t \, \prod_n^N p^n_{i_n,
t},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the number of latent classes and &lt;math&gt;p_t&lt;/math&gt; are the so-called recruitment
or unconditional probabilities that should sum to one. &lt;math&gt;p^n_{i_n, t}&lt;/math&gt; are the
marginal or conditional probabilities.

For a two-way latent class model, the form is
: &lt;math&gt;p_{ij} \approx \sum_t^T p_t \, p_{it} \, p_{jt}.&lt;/math&gt;
This two-way model is related to [[probabilistic latent semantic analysis]] and [[non-negative matrix factorization]].

== Related methods ==
As in much of statistics, there is a large number of methods with distinct names and uses, which share a common relationship. [[Cluster analysis]] is, like LCA, used to discover taxon-like groups of cases in data. Multivariate mixture estimation (MME) is applicable to continuous data, and assumes that such data arise from a mixture of distributions: imagine a set of heights arising from a mixture of men and women. If a multivariate mixture estimation is constrained so that measures must be uncorrelated within each distribution it is termed [[latent profile analysis]]. Modified to handle discrete data, this constrained analysis is known as LCA. Discrete latent trait models further constrain the classes to form from segments of a single dimension: essentially allocating members to classes on that dimension: an example would be assigning cases to social classes on a dimension of ability or merit.

As a practical instance, the variables could be [[multiple choice]] items of a political questionnaire. The data in this case consists of a N-way [[contingency table]] with answers to the items for a number of respondents. In this example, the latent variable refers to political opinion and the latent classes to political groups. Given group membership, the [[conditional probabilities]] specify the chance certain answers are chosen.

== Application ==
LCA may be used in many fields, such as: [[collaborative filtering]],&lt;ref name="Cheung2004"&gt;{{cite journal

She attended [[Paris Dauphine University]] where she studied [[economics]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] at Institut National des Langues et Civilisations Orientales. She became fluent in Mandarin and spent time in [[Shanghai]] as part of her Far East Studies.&lt;ref name="HB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BoF"&gt;{{cite news | title =Laure Heriard Dubreuil| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = Business of Fashion| date =2014 | url =http://www.businessoffashion.com/laure-heriard-dubreuil | accessdate =25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 90s, she decided to attend [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] (FIT) where she earned a degree in [[Merchandising]].&lt;ref name="HB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt;

==Career==

After graduating from FIT, Heriard Dubreuil returned to France where she worked as a merchandiser alongside [[Nicolas Ghesquière]] at Balenciaga and, later, alongside [[Stefano Pilati]] at Yves Saint Laurent. In 2007, she decided to move to Miami to open The Webster Miami.&lt;ref name="HB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite news | title =Laure Heriard Dubreuil| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[Interview (magazine)|''Interview'']]| date =January 2013 | url =http://www.interviewmagazine.com/fashion/the-curators-laure-heriard-dubreuil#_ | accessdate =25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shop features items from a number of prominent brands including [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]], [[Azzedine Alaïa]],&lt;ref name="WMag02"/&gt; Pierre Hardy, and [[Céline (brand)|Céline]].&lt;ref name="TNY"&gt;{{cite news | last =Moss| first =Hilary | title =Laure Heriard Dubreuil on What to Pack for Paris | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = ''[[T: The New York Times Style Magazine]]''| date =23 September 2014 | url =http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/paris-fashion-week-spring-2015-laure-heriard-dubreuil-webster-miami-what-to-pack/?_r=0 | accessdate =25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;The shop itself is housed in a renovated 1939 [[Art Deco]] building designed by [[Henry Hohauser]]&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt; on [[Collins Avenue]] in [[Miami Beach]].&lt;ref name="HB2"&gt;{{cite news | last =Pieri| first =Kerry| title =BAZAAR Boards: Miami MVP Laure Heriard Dubreuil| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''| date =13 December 2012 | url =http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a8598/bazaar-boards-laure-heriard-dubreuil-121312/ | accessdate =25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Heriard Dubreuil facilitated a partnership between retailer [[Target Corporation|Target]] and The Webster to become a part of "The Shops at Target" brand.&lt;ref name="R292"&gt;{{cite news | last =Brillson| first =Leila| title =YES: The Webster For Target Is Here And We're Giving It Away! | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[Refinery29]]| date =5 April 2012 | url =http://www.refinery29.com/webster-for-target#slide | accessdate =25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, The Webster opened a second location at the [[Bal Harbour Shops]] in Miami Beach.

Les Besser was born and raised in Hungary ([[interbellum]] and [[World War II]] Hunrary and [[Hungarian People's Republic]]). In 1956 he escaped to the West and became a [[Canadian citizen]] in 1971. Later he moved to the United States, graduated from the [[University of Colorado]], and in 2000 he [[naturalized]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=HtF&gt;[http://hpmemoryproject.org/timeline/les_besser/hurdling_to_freedom_00.htm "Mr. COMPACT, Father of Computer-Aided Engineering Software,  Les Besser"], a foreword by John Minck to ''Hurdling to Freedom'' by Les Besser&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=COMP101&gt;[https://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedias/history-of-microwave-software#compact "History of microwave software] at Microwaves 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Besser began working on simulators during his employment at [[Hewlett-Packard]] (1966–1969), using the [[BASIC]] computer language and [[time-sharing]] computers. After leaving HP, he joined the newly formed microwave division of [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], where he authored his first-generation program, SPEEDY,&lt;ref name=SPE101&gt;[http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/historyCAD.cfm#speedy SPEEDY] at Microwaves 101&lt;/ref&gt; Besser later converted another program, originally written for his graduate thesis work,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} to run on a commercial time-share system and launched a part-time business, Compact Engineering (later renamed Compact Software). Besser submitted the description of COMPACT to 
''[[IEEE Transactions]] on Circuit Theory'' in 1972, but it was initially rejected and accepted after addition of large amount of mathematics into it.&lt;ref name=COMP101/&gt; Besser was associated with development of COMPACT until 1983.&lt;ref name=COMP101/&gt; In 1985 Besser founded Besser Associates, a company that offers education in microwave technology.

In November 2016, Khalif presented herself as a candidate for a legislative seat in the Lower House of the [[Federal Parliament of Somalia]]. She was elected a representative for the [[South West State of Somalia|South West State]], earning 41 ballots.&lt;ref name="Fedparl"/&gt;

An electoral oversight body later called for a reelection on the grounds that Khalif and seven other MPs had not met the ballot threshold. The Supreme Court upheld this ruling. However, the decision was eventually overturned by the Federal Parliament, with the Lower House instead authorizing the incumbency of Khalif and the other lawmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judiciary set for supremacy war as House ‘annuls’ Court ruling over election of 8 MPs|url=http://garsoornews.com/mararkamaantay/judiciary-set-for-supremacy-war-as-house-annuls-court-ruling-over-election-of-8-mps/|publisher=Garsoor Online|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the '''Murdoch family''' are prominent as international media proprietors, especially in Australia, the United Kingdom and United States. Some members have also been prominent in the arts, clergy and military in Australia.

Five generations of the family are descended from two [[Scottish Australian|Scottish emigrants to Australia]]: the Reverend James Murdoch (1818–1884), a [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] and his wife Helen, née Garden (1826–1905).&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;[http://www.wargs.com/other/murdoch.html Michael J Wood, 2005, ''Ancestry of Rupert Murdoch''], William Addams Reitwiesner Genealogical Services (17 August 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Both were from the [[Pitsligo]] area of [[Aberdeenshire]] and emigrated to the [[Victoria, Australia|Colony of Victoria]] in 1884.&lt;ref name="wood"/&gt;{{col-begin|width=100%}}

==History==

[[File:Deakin Uni. acc. MS0001 Murdoch family.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Prof. [[Walter Murdoch]] (left) and family at Point Lonsdale, Victoria, in 1910. His wife, Violet (née Hughston) is upper centre. Their daughter, Catherine – as [[Catherine King (radio broadcaster)|Catherine King]] a prominent broadcaster – is centre right and son William (Will) Murdoch is on the right.]]

===First generation===

Helen and the Rev. James Murdoch had 14 children.&lt;ref name="wood"/&gt;

Their eldest child, the [[Patrick John Murdoch|Rev. Patrick Murdoch]] was born in Pitsligo and raised at [[Rosehearty]], Aberdeenshire.&lt;ref name="wood"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gunson, Niel|date=1986|title=Murdoch, Patrick John (1850–1940)|work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordained at [[Cruden Bay|Cruden, Aberdeenshire]], where he also married Annie Brown (in 1882). At the age of 34, Murdoch emigrated with his wife and parents to Victoria. He was a prominent there as a [[Presbyterian]] minister and published several books on theology. Two of Patrick and Annie Murdoch's six children achieved prominence, [[Keith Arthur Murdoch|Sir Keith Murdoch]] and [[Ivon Murdoch|Ivon George Murdoch]].&lt;ref name="wood"/&gt;

Nora Curle Smith, née Murdoch, was born in Pitsligo and married David Curle Smith (1859–1922). A pioneering electrical engineer, David Curle Smith was in charge of the municipal electricity supply at [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia]] during the early 20th century, invented a pioneering [[electric stove]], which he patented in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curle Smith |first=H.

Sir Walter Murdoch {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCMG}}, who was born at Rosehearty, was a prominent Australian academic and essayist. He married Violet Catherine Hughston in 1897. Murdoch published his first essay, "The new school of Australian poets", in 1899 and for many years he wrote a weekly column titled "Books and Men" for the ''[[Melbourne Argus]]'' (under the pen name of "Elzevir").&lt;ref name="walter"/&gt; His academic career began with an appointment in 1904 as an assistant lecturer in English at [[Melbourne University]].{{cn|date=April 2016}} In 1913, he was appointed founding Professor of English at the [[University of Western Australia]] (UWA). During the 1920s, his essays were syndicated across Australia through the [[The Herald and Weekly Times|Herald &amp; Weekly Times]] newspaper group run by his nephew, Sir Keith Murdoch (see below). Collections of Walter Murdoch's writings were published in book form from the 1930s onward. He was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George|Companion of the Order of St Michael &amp; St George]] (CMG) in 1939, served as Chancellor of UWA in 1943–48 and was made a Professor Emeritus upon his retirement. Violet Murdoch died in 1952 and 10 years later Murdoch remarried, to Barbara Marshall Cameron. He was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George|Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael &amp; St George]] (KCMG) in 1964.&lt;ref name="walter"&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/murdoch-sir-walter-logie-7698 Fred Alexander, 1986, "Murdoch, Sir Walter Logie (1874–1970)", ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'']; accessed 20 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Rupert Murdoch}}
Rupert Murdoch {{post-nominals|country=AUS|sep=,|AC}}, {{post-nominals|country=UK|KSG}}, born in [[Melbourne]], is a major international media proprietor – he chairs two United States-based companies that control most of his assets: [[News Corp]] and [[New Fox]]. Murdoch's career as a media proprietor began in 1952, when he inherited his father's stake in [[News Limited]].&lt;ref name="witzel"/&gt; The company's only major asset was an [[Adelaide, South Australia|Adelaide]] daily newspaper distributed only in South Australia, [[The News (Adelaide)|''The News'']]. During the 1950s and 1960s, News Ltd acquired daily and weekly newspapers, including suburban and provincial publications, throughout Australia and New Zealand. From 1968, Murdoch bought British newspapers, beginning with the weekly ''[[News of the World]]'' and the daily ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.&lt;ref Name= "Deals"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/18/citynews.pressandpublishing|title=Rupert Murdoch – a lifetime of deals|date=18 July 2007|location=London, UK|work=The Guardian|first=Chris|last=Tryhorn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murdoch made his first acquisition in the United States in 1973, when he purchased the ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]''. Soon afterwards, he founded a US [[supermarket tabloid]] ''[[Star Magazine|Star]]'', and in 1976, he purchased the ''[[New York Post]]''.&lt;ref name="witzel"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Witzel, Morgen |editorlink=Morgen Witzel|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of the History of American Management|date=2005|location=Bristol, England|publisher=Thoemmes Continuum|page=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Murdoch acquired ''[[The Times]]'' of London and ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. He bought a major stake in [[20th Century Fox]] in 1984, which became the basis of a new US [[free to air]] television network, [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].&lt;ref name="witzel"/&gt; To satisfy a legal requirement that only US citizens could own US television stations, Murdoch became a naturalised US citizen in 1985, and consequently forfeited his Australian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Given|first=Jock|title=Foreign Ownership of Media and Telecommunications: an Australian story|journal=Media &amp; Arts Law Review|volume=7|issue=4|page=253|date=December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The World's Billionaires No.73 Rupert Murdoch|newspaper=Forbes|date=7 October 2007|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/10/07billionaires_Rupert-Murdoch_639W.html|accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s and 1990s, Murdoch became involved in [[pay television]] interests throughout the world, including [[STAR TV]] and [[Tata Sky]] in Asia and [[BSkyB]], [[Sky Italia]] and [[Sky Deutschland]] in Europe. NewsCorp also came to control both a major international publishing house [[HarperCollins]], and [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]], which includes ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

'''Open-source intelligence''' ('''OSINT''') is data collected from publicly available sources to be used in an [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Source Intelligence|url=http://www.oss.net/dynamaster/file_archive/040320/fb893cded51d5ff6145f06c39a3d5094/OSS1997-02-33.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Intelligence agency|intelligence community]], the term "open" refers to [[wiktionary:overt#Adjective|overt]], publicly available sources (as opposed to covert or clandestine sources). It is not related to [[open-source software]] or [[Collective intelligence|public intelligence]].

OSINT under one name or another has been around for hundreds of years. With the advent of instant communications and rapid information transfer, a great deal of actionable and predictive intelligence can now be obtained from public, unclassified sources.

==Principles==
Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the collection and analysis of information that is gathered from public, or open, sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/tip/Using-open-source-intelligence-software-for-cybersecurity-intelligence|title=Using open source intelligence software for cybersecurity intelligence|last=McLaughlin|first=Michael|date=June 2012|work=ComputerWeekly.com|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; OSINT is primarily used in [[national security]], [[law enforcement]], and [[competitive intelligence|business intelligence]] functions and is of value to analysts who use non-sensitive intelligence in answering [[classified information|classified]], [[classified information|unclassified]], or [[trade secret|proprietary intelligence]] [[intelligence requirement|requirements]] across the previous intelligence disciplines.

OSINT sources can be divided up into six different categories of information flow:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The US Intelligence Community |asin=0813349184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Media:''', print [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], [[radio]], and [[television]] from across and between countries.
*'''[[Internet]]''', [[online publication]]s, [[blogs]], [[discussion group]]s, citizen media (i.e. – cell phone [[digital video|videos]], and [[user created content]]), [[YouTube]], and other [[social ]]media websites (i.e. – [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram|&lt;span lang="vi"&gt;Instagram&lt;/span&gt;]], etc.).  This source also outpaces a variety of other sources due to its timeliness and ease of access.
*'''Public Government Data''', public government reports, budgets, hearings, [[telephone directories]], press conferences, websites, and speeches. Although this source comes from an official source they are publicly accessible and may be used openly and freely.
*'''Professional and Academic Publications''', information acquired from [[Academic journal|journal]]s, conferences, symposia, [[academic publishing|academic papers]], dissertations, and theses.
*'''Commercial Data''', [[satellite imagery|commercial imagery]], financial and industrial assessments, and databases.
*'''[[Grey literature]]''', technical reports, [[preprint]]s, patents, working papers, business documents, unpublished works, and [[newsletter]]s.

OSINT is distinguished from research in that it applies the [[process of intelligence]] to create tailored knowledge supportive of a specific decision by a specific individual or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spy Agencies Turn to Newspapers, NPR, and Wikipedia for Information: The intelligence community is learning to value 'open-source' information |url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/national/2008/09/12/spy-agencies-turn-to-newspapers-npr-and-wikipedia-for-information.html |accessdate=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
OSINT is defined by both the U.S. [[Director of National Intelligence]] and the U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD), as "produced from publicly available information that is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence requirement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ163.109 As defined in Sec. 931 of Public Law 109-163, entitled, "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006."]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to political scientist [[Jeffrey T. Richelson]], “open source acquisition involves procuring, verbal, written, or electronically transmitted material that can be obtained legally. In addition to documents and videos available via the [[Internet]] or provided by a human source, others are obtained after U.S. or allied forced have taken control of a facility or site formerly operated by a foreign government or [[terrorist]] group.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richelson|first1=Jeffrey T|authorlink1=Jeffrey T. Richelson|title=The U.S. Intelligence Community|publisher=[[Avalon Publishing]]|isbn=9780813349190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4sxVDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT284&amp;lpg=PT284|accessdate=15 May 2017|language=en|date=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Security researcher [[Mark M. Lowenthal]] defines OSINT as “any and all information that can be derived from overt collection: all types of media, government reports and other documents, scientific research and reports, commercial vendors of information, the Internet, and so on. The main qualifiers to open-source information are that it does not require any type of clandestine collection techniques to obtain it and that it must be obtained through means that entirely meet the copyright and commercial requirements of the vendors were applicable."&lt;ref name="Lowenthal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=George|first1=edited by Roger Z|last2=Kline|first2=Robert D|last3=Lownethal|first3=Mark M|title=Intelligence and the national security strategist : enduring issues and challenges|date=2005|publisher=[[Rowman and Littlefield]]|location=Lanham|isbn=9780742540392|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jJxyIb2hN4MC&amp;pg=PA273&amp;lpg=PA273|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:911 commission seal.svg|200px|thumb|right|Seal of the [[9/11 Commission]]]]
OSINT in the [[United States]] traces its origins to the creation of the [[Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service|Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service (FBMS)]], an agency responsible for the monitoring of foreign broadcasts. An example of their work is reflected in the application of the correlation of changes in the price of oranges in Paris with that of railway bridges being bombed successfully.&lt;ref name="BornnMil"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bornn|first1=D Marshall|title=Service members, civilians learn to harness power of 'Open Source' information|url=https://www.army.mil/article/94007/Service_members__civilians_learn_to_harness_power_of__Open_Source__information|website=www.army.mil|accessdate=14 May 2017|language=en|date=9 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aspin-Brown Commission]] stated in 1996 that US access to open sources was "severely deficient" and that this should be a "top priority" for both funding and DCI attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Five Disciplines of Intelligence Collection|last=Lowenthal|first=Mark|last2=Clark|first2=Robert|publisher=CQ Press|year=2015|isbn=978-1483381114|location=|page=18|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, following the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[9/11 Commission]] recommended the creation of an open-source intelligence agency.&lt;ref&gt;See page 413 of the [http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_FM.pdf 9-11 Commission Report (pdf)].&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005, the [[Iraq Intelligence Commission]] recommended the creation of an open-source directorate at the CIA.

Following these recommendations, in November 2005 the [[United States Director of National Intelligence|Director of National Intelligence]] announced the creation of the DNI [[Open Source Center]]. The Center was established to collect information available from "the Internet, databases, press, radio, television, video, geospatial data, photos and commercial imagery."&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Director of National Intelligence. "[http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/20051108_release.htm ODNI Announces Establishment of Open Source Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623072458/http://dni.gov/press_releases/20051108_release.htm |date=2006-06-23 }}". Press release, 8 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to collecting openly available information, it would train analysts to make better use of this information. The Center absorbed the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s previously existing [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] (FBIS), originally established in 1941, with FBIS head Douglas Naquin named as director of the Center.&lt;ref&gt;Ensor, David. "[http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/08/sr.tues/ The Situation Report: Open source intelligence center]". ''CNN'', 8 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, following the events of [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] the [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act]] merged FBIS and other research elements into the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] creating the [[Open Source Enterprise]].

Furthermore, the private sector has invested in tools which aid in OSINT collection and analysis. Specifically, [[In-Q-Tel]], a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] supported venture capital firm in Arlington, VA assisted companies develop web-monitoring and predictive analysis tools.

In December 2005, the Director of National Intelligence appointed [[Eliot A. Jardines]] as the [[Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Open Source]] to serve as the Intelligence Community's senior intelligence officer for open source and to provide strategy, guidance and oversight for the [[National Open Source Enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Director of National Intelligence "[http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/20051207_release.htm ODNI Senior Leadership Announcement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623072305/http://dni.gov/press_releases/20051207_release.htm |date=2006-06-23 }}".

==Risks for practitioners==
A main hindrance to practical OSINT is the volume of information it has to deal with ("[[information explosion]]"). The amount of data being distributed increases at a rate that it becomes difficult to [[Words of estimative probability|evaluate sources]] in [[intelligence analysis]].

Accredited journalists have some protection in asking questions, and researching for recognized media outlets. Even so, they can be imprisoned, even executed, for seeking out OSINT. Private individuals illegally collecting data for a foreign military or intelligence agency is considered [[espionage]] in most countries. Of course, espionage that is not [[treason]] (i.e. betraying one's country of citizenship) has been a tool of statecraft since ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sun Tzu]] ([[Warring States period]]), ''[[The Art of War]]'', Chapter 13: "Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay of 2 hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Value==
OSINT is valuable because it has less rigorous processing and exploitation processes and timelines than more technical intelligence disciplines such as [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|HUMINT]], [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]], [[Measurement and signature intelligence|MASINT]], [[Geospatial intelligence|GEOINT]], etc. Additionally, OSINT collects a valuable variety of opinions because it encompasses a great variety of sources.

According to the [[Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction]] report submitted in March 2005, OSINT must be included in the all-source intelligence process for the following reasons (as stated in the report):

#The ever-shifting nature of intelligence needs compels the IC to quickly and easily understand a wide range of foreign countries and cultures. – … today's threats are rapidly changing and geographically diffuse; an intelligence analyst may be forced to shift rapidly from one topic to the next. Increasingly, IC professionals need to quickly assimilate social, economic, and cultural information about a country—information often detailed in open sources.
#Open-source information provides a base for understanding classified materials. Despite large quantities of classified material produced by the IC, the amount of classified information produced on any one topic can be quite limited, and may be taken out of context if viewed only from a classified-source perspective. A notable example relates to terrorism, where open-source information can fill gaps and create links that allow analysts to better understand fragmented intelligence, rumored terrorist plans, possible means of attack, and potential targets.
#Open-source materials can protect sources and methods. Sometimes an intelligence judgment that is actually informed with sensitive, classified information can be defended on the basis of open-source reporting. This can prove useful when policy-makers need to explain policy decisions or communicate with foreign officials without compromising classified sources.
#Only open source can ''store history''. A robust open-source program can, in effect, gather data to monitor the world's cultures and how they change with time. This is difficult, if not impossible, using the ''snapshots'' provided by classified collection methods.&lt;ref&gt;(The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities, 378–379). [[Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
OSINT is a highly diverse form of intelligence collection and analysis. It does not have its own agency, however, units are scattered within the Department of Defense and the State Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/Vol49no2/reexamining_the_distinction_3.htm|title=Reexamining the Distinction Between Open Information and Secrets — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most OSINT collectors need to take precautions while collecting information from the Internet. This can come in the form of using a [[Virtual private network|VPN]] to [[anonymize]] their identity and collect information more discreetly. This is where evaluating sources becomes important to the overall OSINT collection and analysis process. An OSINT analyst needs intelligence evaluation to determine a true process or expose a false process that would affect predicting the future. Finally, the analysts need to find use of the evaluated intelligence so that it can be incorporated into a finished classified, unclassified, or proprietary intelligence product.

[[Information collection]] in OSINT is generally a different problem from collection in other intelligence disciplines where obtaining the raw information to be analyzed may be the major difficulty, particularly if it is to be obtained from non-cooperative targets. In OSINT, the chief difficulty is in identifying relevant, reliable sources from the vast amount of publicly available information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=R1YMCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT81&amp;lpg=PT81&amp;dq=In+OSINT,+the+chief+difficulty+is+in+identifying+relevant,+reliable+sources+from+the+vast+amount+of+publicly+available+information.#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20OSINT%2C%20the%20chief%20difficulty%20is%20in%20identifying%20relevant%2C%20reliable%20sources%20from%20the%20vast%20amount%20of%20publicly%20available%20information.&amp;f=false|title=No Safe Haven: Homeland Insecurity|last=Hudnall|first=Ken|publisher=Grave Distractions Publications|year=2011|isbn=9781452493923|location=|pages=|chapter=Intelligence Failures}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not as great a challenge for those who know how to access local knowledge and how to leverage human experts who can create new tailored knowledge on the fly. {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==OSINT Community Disciplines==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}

===United States===
====Government====
There are a large number of open-source activities taking place throughout the US Government.  Frequently, these open-source activities are described as "media monitoring", "media analysis", "internet research" and "public surveys" but are open source nonetheless.

The [[Library of Congress]] sponsors the [[Federal Research Division]] (FRD) which conducts a great deal of tailored open-source research on a fee-for-service basis for the executive branch.

====Intelligence====
The [[US Intelligence Community]]'s open-source activities (known as the [[National Open Source Enterprise]]) are dictated by Intelligence Community Directive 301 promulgated by the Director of National Intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;DNI Intelligence Community Directive 301 – [https://fas.org/irp/dni/icd/icd-301.pdf "National Open Source Enterprise"] 11 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Directive establishes the authorities and responsibilities of the Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Open Source (ADDNI/OS), the DNI's Open Source Center and the National Open Source Committee.

Prior to the establishment of the National Open Source Enterprise, the [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] (FBIS), established in 1941, was the government's primary open-source unit, transcribing and translating foreign broadcasts. It absorbed the Defense Department's [[Joint Publications Research Service]] (JPRS), which did a similar function with foreign printed materials, including newspapers, magazines, and technical journals.

====Armed Forces====

The former [[Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence]], Dr. [[Stephen Cambone]] encouraged in part by the [[Defense Science Board]] reports on [[Strategic Communication]] and [[Transition to and From Hostilities]], created the Defense Open Source Program (DOSP).  The current Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence is assigned executive agency for this program to the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]].

U.S. military offices that engage in OSINT activities include:

*[[Unified Combatant Command]]
*[[Defense Intelligence Agency]]
*[[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]
*[[Foreign Military Studies Office|US Army Foreign Military Studies Office]]
*[https://fas.org/irp/agency/dod/eucom/jac/ EUCOM JAC Molesworth]
*Foreign Media Monitoring in Support of Information Operations, [[U.S. Strategic Command]]

====Homeland Security====
The [[Department of Homeland Security]] has an active open-source intelligence unit. In congressional testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee's Intelligence, Information Sharing and Terrorism Risk Assessment Subcommittee the Undersecretary of Homeland Security Charles Allen indicated on February 14, 2007, that he had established the "Domestic Open Source Enterprise" to support the Department's OSINT needs and that of state, local and tribal partners.

====Law enforcement====
The law enforcement OSINT community applies open-source intelligence (OSINT) to the [[crime prediction|prediction]], prevention, investigation, and prosecution of criminals including terrorists. Additionally, [[fusion center]]s around the US are increasingly utilizing OSINT to support their intelligence generation and investigations.

Examples of successful law enforcement OSINT include [[Scotland Yard]] OSINT; [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) OSINT.

[[INTERPOL]] and [[EUROPOL]] experimented with OSINT units for a time, but they appear to have atrophied with the departure of their individual champions.

[[New York Police Department]] (NYPD) is known to have an OSINT unit, as does the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]], housed within the Emergency Operations Bureau and affiliated with the LA Joint Regional Intelligence Center.

====Business====
Business OSINT encompasses [[Commercial Intelligence]], [[Competitor Intelligence]], and [[Business Intelligence]], and is often a chief area of practice of [[private intelligence agency|private intelligence agencies]].

Businesses may use [[information broker]]s and [[private investigator]]s to collect and analyze relevant information for business purposes which may include the [[Mass media|media]], [[Deep Web (search indexing)|deep web]], [[web 2.0]] and commercial content.

====Private Specialized Business (assisting the Criminal Justice field)====
Another related business group within the United States that relies upon OSINT is the commercial Bail Bond industry. This related industry, servicing the court system, is apart from the above [[Business Intelligence]] sector.
OSINT is useful to Bail Bond agencies that employ a private Fugitive Recovery Agency to locate and apprehend their absent client;i.e., a criminal defendant who has failed to appear for court and subsequently a warrant for arrest was issued. OSINT is the first method of discovery to help locate the defendant when initial interviewing of the bond co-signers, defendant's relatives and friends is lacking. OSINT gathering leads the investigator to discover an alternate hypothesis to analyze and then match relevant data for making a prediction regarding the fugitive's location; e.g., data is scrubbed from web access on Facebook entries, Twitter messages, and Snapchat.

Should those methods fail, the next step is to seek the specialized Behavioral Intelligence services that reference OSINT to aid in establishing the veracity of subjects during the forensic interview and is used to create a behavioral profile. OSINT data is correlated with interview data to include a variety behavioral patterns; e.g., a list of daily personal contacts, habits of activities, visited places of interest, vehicles used, favorite group involvements, etc. According to the Director, psychologist and forensic interviewer at MN-Behavioral Intelligence Agency, (2016) OSINT data base has to be critically filtered and analyzed before it can be applied within investigative interviewing and interrogation.

== Open Source Intelligence analysis software ==
There are several categories of tools intended for OSINT analysis. First category is open source tools to query multiple search engines simultaneously as IntelTechniques or search engines that provide the results separately as All in One or [[DuckDuckGo]]. This category also includes social media search engines and search engines of domains and people as Pipl.com, Whois.net, Website.informer. Second category is designed for big data analytics platforms as DataWalk which allow to automatically combine OSINT insight with local, internal data for further visual analysis and search for hidden connections across billions of records.

'''Peopleware''' is a term used to refer to one of the three core aspects of computer technology, the other two being [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]]. Peopleware can refer to anything that has to do with the role of people in the development or use of computer software and hardware systems, including such issues as developer productivity, teamwork, group dynamics, the psychology of programming, project management, organizational factors, human interface design, and human-machine-interaction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Larry Constantine]] ''Constantine on Peopleware'' Prentice Hall, 1995, p. xxi. ({{ISBN|0-13-331976-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The concept of peopleware in the software community covers a variety of aspects:&lt;ref&gt;Silvia T. Acuna (2005). ''A Software Process Model Handbook for Incorporating People's Capabilities''. pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Development of productive persons
* Organizational culture
* Organizational learning
* Development of productive teams, and

The neologism, first used by [[Peter G. Neumann]] in 1977&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter G. Neumann]] "Peopleware in Systems." in ''Peopleware in Systems.'' Cleveland, OH: Assoc. for Systems management, 1977, pp 15–18. ({{ISBN|0-934356-13-0}})&lt;/ref&gt; and independently coined by Meilir Page-Jones in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;Page-Jones, M. ''Practical Guide to Structured Systems Design.'' New York: Yourdon Press. ({{ISBN|0-13-690769-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; was popularized in the 1987 book ''[[Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams]]'' by [[Tom DeMarco]] and Timothy Lister.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom DeMarco]] and Timothy Lister. ''[[Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams]].'' New York: Dorset House, 1987. ({{ISBN|0-932633-43-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Peopleware" also became the title and subject matter of a long-running series of columns by [[Larry Constantine]] in Software Development magazine, later compiled in book form.&lt;ref&gt;[[Larry Constantine]] ''The Peopleware Papers'' Prentice Hall, 2001. ({{ISBN|0-13-060123-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Positioning''' refers to the place that a [[brand]] occupies in the mind of the customer and how it is distinguished from products from competitors. In order to position products or brands, companies may emphasize the distinguishing features of their brand (what it is, what it does and how, etc.) or they may try to create a suitable image (inexpensive or premium, utilitarian or luxurious, entry-level or high-end, etc.) through the [[marketing mix]]. Once a brand has achieved a strong position, it can become difficult to reposition it.

Positioning is one of the most powerful [[marketing]] concepts. Originally, positioning focused on the product and with Ries and Trout grew to include building a product's reputation and ranking among competitor's products. Schaefer and Kuehlwein extend the concept beyond material and rational aspects to include 'meaning' carried by a brand's mission or myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking Prestige Branding - Secrets of the Ueber-Brands|last=Kuehlwein|first=JP|last2=Schaefer|first2=Wolfgang|publisher=Kogan Page|year=2015|isbn=0749470038|location=London|pages=15-16, 115-116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily, positioning is about "the place a brand occupies in the mind of its target audience".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andrei|first=P|last2=Ecaterina|first2=B, R|last3=Ionut|first3=T. C|date=2010|title=Does Positioning Have a Place in the Minds of our Students?|url=|journal=Annals of the University of Oradea, Economic Science Series|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Positioning is now a regular marketing activity or strategy. A national positioning strategy can often be used, or modified slightly, as a tool to accommodate entering into foreign markets.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell p. 26"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sandra Bell|title=International Brand Management of Chinese Companies: Case Studies on the Chinese Household Appliances and Consumer Electronics Industry Entering US and Western European Markets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Iz4huRKjRIC&amp;pg=PA26|date=March 29, 2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-7908-2030-0|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the positioning concept are unclear. Scholars suggest that it may have emerged from the burgeoning advertising industry in the period following [[World War I]], only to be codified and popularised in the 1950s and 60s. The positioning concept became very influential and continues to evolve in ways that ensure it remains current and relevant to practising marketers.

==Definitions==

[[David Ogilvy (businessman)|David Ogilvy]] noted that while there was no real consensus as to the meaning of positioning among marketing experts, his definition is "what a product does, and who it is for". For instance, Dove has been successfully positioned  as bars of soap for women with dry hands, vs. a product for men with dirty hands.&lt;ref name="Ogilvy PT17"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Ogilvy|title=Ogilvy on Advertising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hVFwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17|date=September 11, 2013|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8041-7005-5|page=PT17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ries and Trout advanced several definitions of positioning. In an article, ''Industrial Marketing,'' published in 1969, [[Jack Trout]] stated that positioning is a mental device used by consumers to simplify information inputs and store new information in a logical place. He said this is important because the typical consumer is overwhelmed with unwanted advertising, and has a natural tendency to discard all information that does not immediately find a comfortable (and empty) slot in their mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Jack Trout | title=Positioning" is a game people play in today's me-too market place | journal=Industrial Marketing | year=1969 |  pages=51–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind,'' the duo expanded the definition as "an organized system for finding a window in the mind. It is based on the concept that communication can only take place at the right time and under the right circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Al Ries|author2=Jack Trout|title=Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QupddZiRKkUC|year=2001|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-137358-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positioning is closely related to the concept of perceived value. In marketing, value is defined as the difference between a prospective customer's evaluation of the benefits and costs of one product when compared with others. Value can be expressed in numerous forms including product benefits, features, style, value for money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=marketing|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=147|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{See also|Product differentiation}}

The precise origins of the positioning concept are unclear. Cano (2003), Schwartzkopf (2008) and others have argued that the concepts of market segmentation and positioning were central to the tacit knowledge that informed brand advertising from the 1920s, but did not become codified in marketing textbooks and journal articles until the 1950s and 60s.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzkopf, S., "Turning Trade Marks into Brands: how Advertising Agencies Created Brands in the Global Market Place, 1900-1930" CGR Working Paper, Queen Mary University, School of Business and Management Centre for Globalization Research London, 18 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cano, C., "The Recent Evolution of Market Segmentation Concepts and Thoughts Primarily by Marketing Academics," in E. Shaw (ed) ''The Romance of Marketing History,''Proceedings of the 11th Conference on Historical Analysis and Research in Marketing (CHARM),'' Boca Ranton, FL, AHRIM, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Al Ries]] and [[Jack Trout]] are often credited with developing the concept of product or brand positioning in the late-1960s with the publication of a series of articles, followed by a book. Ries and Trout, both former advertising executives, published articles about positioning in ''Industrial Marketing'' in 1969 and ''Advertising Age'' in 1972.&lt;ref name="Ellson p. 260"&gt;{{cite book|author=T. Ellson|title=Culture and Positioning as Determinants of Strategy: Personality and the Business Organization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=19CHDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA260|date=March 16, 2004|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-0-230-50981-8|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1970s, positioning became a popular word with marketers, especially those in advertising and promotion. In 1981, Ries and Trout published their now classic book, ''Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind''. However, the claim that Ries and Trout devised the concept has been challenged by marketing scholars. According to Stephen A. Fox, Al Ries and Jack Trout "resurrected the concept and made it their trademark."&lt;ref name="Fox p. 324"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen R. Fox|title=The Mirror Makers: A History of American Advertising and Its Creators|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QlVB6ARdT7kC&amp;pg=PA324|year=1984|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-06659-7|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dove III.jpg|thumb|In 1957, David Ogilvy used the positioning concept to position Dove as a beauty soap for women]] 

[[File:1994-1997 Saab 9000 CD 2.3t sedan (2011-10-25) 01.jpg|thumb|In 1961, Ogilvy positioned the Saab as the car for the European winter]]

[[File:Lux ad 1916.jpeg|thumb|Lux, print advertisement (1916) positioned the soap as a gentle product for washing delicate clothing]]
Some scholars credit advertising guru, [[David Ogilvy (businessman)|David Ogilvy]], with developing the positioning concept in the mid-1950s, at least a decade before Ries and Trout published their now classic series of articles.&lt;ref&gt;Urde, M. and Koch, C., "Market and brand-oriented schools of positioning", ''Journal of Product &amp; Brand Management,'' vol. 23, no. 7, 2014, pp 478-490&lt;/ref&gt; In their early writing, Ries and Trout suggest that the positioning concept was widely used in the advertising industry prior to the 1950s. Ogilvy's own writings indicate that he was well aware of the concept and drilled his creative team with this idea from at least the 1950s. Among other things, Ogilvy wrote that "the most important decision is how to position your product" and,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ogilvy, D., ''Confessions of an Advertising Man'', 1963&lt;/ref&gt; "Everyone in the organization should understand the brand positioning and use it as context for making decisions"&lt;ref&gt;David Ogilvy, ''Ogilvy on Advertising,'' Vintage Books, (1983), 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and "Every advertisement is part of the long-term investment in the personality of the brand."&lt;ref&gt;Ogilvy, D, "The Image and the brand: a new approach to creative operations," Speech given at AAAA Luncheon in Chicago, 4 October 4, 1955 and cited in Schwarzkopf, S., "Turning Trade Marks into Brands: how Advertising Agencies Created Brands in the Global Market Place, 1900-1930" CGR Working Paper, Queen Mary University, London, 18 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Ogilvy is on record as having used the positioning concept in several campaigns in the mid 1950s and early 1960s, well before Ries and Trout published their articles on positioning. In relation to a Dove campaign launched in 1957, Ogilvy explained, "I could have positioned Dove as a detergent bar for men with dirty hands, but chose instead to position it as a toilet bar for women with dry skin. This is still working 25 years later."&lt;ref name="David Ogilvy 1983 p. 12"&gt;David Ogilvy, ''Ogilvy on Advertising,'' (1983) Vintage Books, 1985, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to a SAAB campaign launched in 1961, Ogilvy later recalled that "In Norway, the SAAB car had no measurable profile. We positioned it as a car for winter. Three years later it was voted the best car for Norwegian winters."&lt;ref name="David Ogilvy 1983 p. 12"/&gt;

Yet other scholars have suggested that the positioning concept may have much earlier heritage, attributing the concept to the work of advertising agencies in both the US and the UK in the first decades of the twentieth century. Cano, for example, has argued that marketing practitioners followed competitor-based approaches to both market segmentation and product positioning in the first decades of the twentieth century; long before these concepts were introduced into the marketing literature in the 1950s and 60s.&lt;ref&gt;Cano,  C., "The  Recent  Evolution  of  Market  Segmentation  Concepts  and  Thoughts  Primarily  by  Marketing  Academics," in  E.  Shaw  (ed.), ''The  Romance of Marketing History: Proceedings  of  the  11th  Conference  on  Historical  Analysis  and  Research  in  Marketing (CHARM), '' Boca Ranton, FL: AHRIM, 2003, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; From around 1920, American agency, [[J. Walter Thompson]] (JWT), began to focus on developing brand personality, brand image and brand identity—concepts that are very closely related to positioning. Across the Atlantic, the English agency, W. S. Crawford's Ltd, began to use the concept of 'product personality' and the 'advertising idea' arguing that in order to stimulate sales and create a 'buying habit' advertising had to 'build a definitive association of ideas round the goods'.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzkopf, S., ''Turning Trade Marks into Brands: how Advertising Agencies Created Brands in the Global Market Place, 1900-1930,'' CGR Working Paper, Queen Mary University, London, 18 August 2008, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1915 JWT acquired the advertising account for Lux soap. The agency suggested that the traditional positioning as a product for woolen garments should be broadened so that consumers would see it as a soap for use on all fine fabrics in the household. To implement, Lux was repositioned with a more up-market posture, and began a long association with expensive clothing and high fashion. Cano has argued that the positioning strategy JWT used for Lux exhibited an insightful understanding of the way that consumers mentally construct brand images. JWT recognised that advertising effectively manipulated socially shared symbols. In the case of Lux, the brand disconnected from images of household drudgery, and connected with images of leisure and fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Cano,  C., "The  Recent  Evolution  of  Market  Segmentation  Concepts  and  Thoughts  Primarily  by  Marketing  Academics," in  E.  Shaw  (ed.), ''The  Romance of Marketing History: Proceedings  of  the  11th  Conference  on  Historical  Analysis  and  Research  in  Marketing (CHARM), '' Boca Ranton, FL: AHRIM, 2003, pp 16-18&lt;/ref&gt;

As advertising executives in their early careers, both Ries and Trout were exposed to the positioning concept via their work. Ries and Trout codified the tacit knowledge that was available in the advertising industry; popularising the positioning concept with the publication their articles and books. Ries and Trout were influential in diffusing the concept of positioning from the advertising community through to the broader marketing community. Their articles were to become highly influential.&lt;ref&gt;Enis, B. and Cox,K., ''Marketing classics: a selection of influential articles,'' Boston, Allyn and Bacon, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1970s, positioning became a popular word with marketers, especially those that were working in the area of advertising and promotion. In 1981 Ries and Trout published their classic book, ''Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind'' (McGraw-Hill 1981). The concept enjoys ongoing currency among both advertisers and marketers as suggested by Maggard&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maggard|first=John P.|date=1976-01-01|title=Positioning Revisited|jstor=1250678|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=40|issue=1|pages=63–66|doi=10.2307/1250678}}&lt;/ref&gt; who notes that positioning provides planners with a valuable conceptual vehicle, which is effectively used to make various strategy techniques more meaningful and more productive.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Several large brands – [[Lipton]], [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]], and [[Tide (brand)|Tide]] – developed "precisely worded" positioning statements that guided how products would be packaged, promoted and advertised in the 1950s and 1960s. The article, "How Brands Were Born: A Brief History of Modern Marketing," states, "This marked the start of almost 50 years of marketing where 'winning' was determined by understanding the consumer better than competitors and getting the total 'brand mix' right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=How Brands Were Born: A Brief History of Modern Marketing | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/10/how-brands-were-born-a-brief-history-of-modern-marketing/246012/ | journal=The Atlantic | author=Marc de Swaan Aron | date=October 3, 2011 | accessdate=November 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This early positioning tactic was focused on the product itself – its "form, package size, and price", according to [[Al Ries]] and [[Jack Trout]]&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The positioning concept continues to evolve. Traditionally called product positioning, the concept was limited due to its focus on the product alone.&lt;ref name="Battle 2001 p. 2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Al Ries|author2=Jack Trout|title=Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BHj1OYgF7wC|date=January 3, 2001|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-170587-5|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;In addition to the previous focus on the product, positioning now includes building a brand's reputation and competitive standing.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; John P. Maggard notes that positioning provides planners with a valuable conceptual vehicle for implementation of more meaningful and productive [[marketing strategy|marketing strategies]].&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt; Many branding practitioners make positioning a part of [[brand]] strategy and even label it as "brand positioning"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.thebrandingjournal.com/2016/11/brand-positioning-definition/ | title =A Simple Definition of Brand Positioning| website =The Branding Journal| access-date = November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://equibrandconsulting.com/approach/anticipated-benefits | title =Brand Positioning Strategy| website =Equibrand Consulting| access-date = November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, in the book ''Get to Aha! Discover Your Positioning DNA and Dominate Your Competition'', [[Andrea Cunningham|Andy Cunningham]] proposes that branding is actually "derived from positioning; it is the emotional expression of positioning. Branding is the yang to positioning's yin, and when both pieces come together, you have a sense of the company's identity as a whole"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cunningham |  first = Andy |author-link=Andrea Cunningham | title =Get to Aha!

==Developing the positioning statement==

[[File:STP approach.jpg|thumb|500px|The STP approach highlights the three areas of decision-making]]

Positioning is part of the broader marketing strategy which includes three basic decision levels, namely segmentation, targeting and positioning, sometimes known as the S-T-P approach:

:'''[[Market segmentation|Segmentation]]''': refers to the process of dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups of consumers (known as segments)&lt;ref&gt;Moutinho, L., "Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning and Strategic Marketing," Chapter 5 in Strategic Management in Tourism, Moutinho, L. (ed),  CAB International, 2000, pp. 121–166&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''[[Target market|Targeting]]''': refers to the selection of a segment or segments that will become the focus of special attention (known as ''[[target market]]s'').&lt;ref&gt;Marketing Insider, "Evaluating Market Segments", Online: https://marketing-insider.eu/marketing-explained/part-i-defining-marketing-and-the-marketing-process/market-targeting/&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Positioning''':  refers to an overall strategy that "aims to make a brand occupy a distinct position, relative to competing brands, in the mind of the customer".&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/positioning.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

In general terms, there are three broad types of positioning: functional, symbolic, and experiential position. Functional positions resolve problems, provide benefits to customers, or get  favorable perception by investors ([[stock profile]]) and lenders. Symbolic positions address self-image enhancement, ego identification, belongingness and social meaningfulness, and affective fulfillment. Experiential positions provide sensory and cognitive stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulvey|first=Michael|date=January 2009|title=Experiential positioning: Strategic differentiation of customer-brand relationships|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Mulvey3/publication/276848156_Experiential_positioning_Strategic_differentiation_of_customer-brand_relationships/links/5748c1a708ae5c51e29e6b36/Experiential-positioning-Strategic-differentiation-of-customer-brand-relationships.pdf|journal=Innovative Marketing|volume=5|pages=|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positioning statement===
Both theorists and practitioners argue that the positioning statement should be written in a format that includes an identification of the [[target market]], the market need, the product name and category, the key benefit delivered and the basis of the product's differentiation from any competing alternatives.&lt;ref name="Chasm"&gt;{{cite book | title= Crossing the Chasm | year=1991 |author= Geoffrey Moore | publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=0887305199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A basic template for writing positioning statements is as follows: "For (target customer) who (statement of the need or opportunity), the (product name) is a (product category) that (statement of key benefit – that is, compelling reason to buy). Unlike (primary competitive alternative), our product (statement of primary differentiation)."&lt;ref name="Chasm" /&gt; An annotated example of how this positioning statement might be translated for a specific application appears in the text-box that follows.

===Differentiation vs positioning===
Differentiation is closely related to the concept of positioning. [[Product differentiation|Differentiation]] is how a company's product is unique, by being the first, least expensive, or some other distinguishing factor. A product or brand may have many points of difference, but they may not all be meaningful or relevant to the target market. Positioning is something (a perception) that happens in the minds of the [[target market]] whereas differentation is something that marketers do, whether through product design, pricing or promotional activity.&lt;ref name=Lamb&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Lamb|title=Essentials of Marketing|date=2012|publisher=South-Western Cengage Learning|location=Mason, OH|isbn=978-0-538-47834-2|pages=279–82|edition=7e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==
[[File:Hungry Jack's slogan.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Hungry Jack's slogan uses superlative positioning to imply that its burgers are "better" than the market leader]]
[[File:Baby Bath Products on Kroger Shelves.JPG|thumb|J &amp; J Baby Bath Products are positioned against a user or segment, namely children]]
[[File:Lesserbilby.jpg|thumb|Haigh's Chocolates stopped making chocolate Easter bunnies, replacing them with Easter bilbies as culturally appropriate symbol of Easter in Australia]]
To be successful in a particular market a product must occupy an "explicit, distinct and proper place in the minds of all potential and existing consumers".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ostasevičiūtė|first=R|last2=Šliburytė|first2=L|date=February 2008|title=Theoretical Aspects of Product Positioning in the Market|url=|journal=Engineering Economics|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has to also be relative to other rival products with which the brand competes.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This may require considerable research of customer perceptions and competitor activity in order to ensure that the points of difference are meaningful in the minds of customers. Perceptual mapping (discussed below) is often used for this type of research.

Visibility and recognition is what product positioning is all about as the positioning of a product is what the product represents for a buyer the business is targeting. As markets become increasingly competitive, buyer have more purchase choices, and the process of setting one brand apart from rival brands is critical success factor.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; It is vital that a product or service needs to have a clear identity and placement to the needs of the consumers targeted as they will not only purchase the product, but can warrant a larger margin for the company through increased added value.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

A number of different positioning strategies have been cited in the marketing literature:&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, S.C., ''Marketing Strategies, Tactics, and Techniques: A Handbook for Practitioners'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, pp 90-92; Belch, G., Belch, M.A, Kerr, G. and Powell, I., ''Advertising and Promotion Management: An Integrated Marketing Communication Perspective'', McGraw-Hill, Sydney, Australia, 2009, pp 205-206&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptual mapping==

{{main|Perceptual mapping}}

To identify suitable positions that a company or brand might occupy in a given market, analysts often turn to techniques such as perceptual mapping or corresondence analysis. Perceptual maps are a diagrammatic representation of consumers' mental perceptions of the relative place various brands occupy within a category. Traditionally perceptual mapping selects two variables that are relevant to consumers (often, but not necessarily, price and quality) and then asks a sample of the market to explain where they would place various brands in terms of the two variables. Results are averaged across all respondents, and results are plotted on a graph to indicate how the ''average'' member of the population views the brand that make up a category and how each of the brands relates to other brands within the same category. While perceptual maps with two dimensions are common, multi-dimensional maps are also used. A key advantage of perceptual mapping is that it can identify gaps in the market which the firm may choose to 'own.'

===Algorithms used in positioning analysis===

The following statistical procedures have been found to be useful in carrying out positioning analysis:

* [[Cluster analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, D.L. and Franke, G.R., "Correspondence analysis: graphical representation of categorical data in marketing research," ''Journal of Marketing Research,'' 23, 1986, pp 213–227&lt;/ref&gt; including overlapping clustering&lt;ref&gt;Phipps, A., Carroll, J.D. and Wind, Y.J., "Overlapping Clustering: A New Method for Product Positioning," ''Journal of Marketing Research,'' Vol. 18, No. 3 1981, pp. 310-317&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Conjoint analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Green and   Abba M. Krieger  Conjoint analysis with product-positioning applications Chapter 10 in ''Handbook in Operations Research and Management Science'', Vol. 5 [Marketing],  Eliashberg,j. and Lilien, G.L. (eds),  Elsevier, 1993 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0927-0507(05)80023-4, pp 467–515&lt;/ref&gt;     
* [[Multidimensional scaling]] especially non-metric scaling (NMS)&lt;ref&gt;Moutinho, L., "Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning and Strategic Marketing," Chapter 5 in ''Strategic Management in Tourism'', Moutinho, L. (ed),  CAB International, 2000, pp 121-166&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Multivariate analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;Mazanec, J.A., "Positioning analysis with self-organizing maps: An exploratory study on luxury hotels",   ''The Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly'', Vol. 36, No. 6, 1995, pp 80-95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repositioning==

The right positioning strategy at the right time can help a brand build a powerful image in the mind of consumer(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sair|first=S. A|date=2014|title=Consumer Psyche and Positioning Strategies|url=|journal=Pakistan Journal of Commerce &amp; Social Sciences|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From time to time, the current positioning strategy fails to resonate. This could be due to new market entrants, changed customer preferences, structural change within the target market (such as ageing, segment creep) or simply that customers have forgotten about a brand and its position. When this happens, the company may need to consider a number of options:&lt;ref&gt;Blythe, J., ''Key Concepts in Marketing'', Sage, 2009, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

: * Strengthen current positioning: reinforce the concepts of features that led to customers adopting a favourable view in the first instance
: * Establish a new position: look for suitable niches where customers are underserviced and occupy that space 
: * Reposition (or de-position):  change the way customers think about the product or brand, ususally through comparative advertising 

Repositioning involves a deliberate attempt to alter the way that consumers view a product or brand. Repositioning can be a high risk strategy, but sometimes there are few alternatives. &lt;ref&gt;Strydom, J., ''Introduction to Marketing'', Juta and Company, 2005. pp 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

Fishbein and Rosenberg's attitude models&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ray|first=Michael L.|date=1973-01-01|title=A Decision Sequence Analysis of Developments in Marketing Communication|jstor=1250772|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=37|issue=1|pages=29–38|doi=10.2307/1250772}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that it is possible for a business to influence and change the positioning of the brand by manipulating various factors that will affect a consumer's attitude. Research on persons' attitudes suggests that a brand's position in a prospective consumer's mind is likely to be determined by the "combined total of a number of product characteristics such as the price, quality, durability, reliability, colour, and flavour".&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The consumer places important weights on each of these product characteristics and it can be possible by using things such as promotional efforts to realign the weights of price, quality, durability, reliability, colour and flavour of which can then help adjust the position of a brand in the mind of the prospective consumer.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Companies engaging in repositioning can choose to downplay some points of difference and emphasise others.

===Repositioning a company===
{{main article|Turnaround management}}
In volatile markets, it can be necessary – even urgent  – to reposition an entire company, rather than just a product line or brand. When Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley suddenly shifted from investment to commercial banks, for example, the expectations of investors, employees, clients and regulators all needed to shift, and each company needed to influence how these perceptions changed. Doing so involves repositioning the entire firm. This is especially true of small and medium-sized firms, many of which often lack strong brands for individual product lines. In a prolonged recession, business approaches that were effective during healthy economies often become ineffective and it becomes necessary to change a firm's positioning. Upscale restaurants, for example, which previously flourished on expense account dinners and corporate events, may for the first time need to stress value as a sale tool.

Repositioning a company involves more than a marketing challenge. It involves making hard decisions about how a market is shifting and how a firm's competitors will react. Often these decisions must be made without the benefit of sufficient information, simply because the definition of "volatility" is that change becomes
difficult or impossible to predict.

{{Notability|date=February 2018}}

'''Ricardo Armbruster''' (1944 – 1976) was a Spanish ecologist, adventurer and entrepreneur.

Ricardo Armbruster Blecher (Nano) was born in [[Madrid]] to the German/Spanish family Armbruster/Blecher. His father Eugen Armbruster was a successful industrialist in Spain (tubes, plastics, metals, energy, banks, forests) and his mother, Trude Armbruster ([[Given name|née]] Blecher) was a renowned violinist.

At an early age, Ricardo Armbruster and his family discovered that schooling and academic life were not going to be his preferred way of advancing personally. He developed a wide interest in animals and nature in the 1950s, spending long periods at the family farm in [[Camorritos]], Spain, and becoming a respected naturalist at a very early stage. Soon afterwards, at the age of 17, he decided to travel and learn. He spent some time at several academies and jobs in Switzerland, Germany and [[London]], before returning to Madrid and, from there, to the American continent. First, he traveled around the United States and Mexico with his brother and friends, before accepting a job at a bookstore in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]. After feeling frustrated by the fact that the store sold books by length for decoration rather than for reading, he felt the call of the wild, embarked on a trip to the south and disappeared in the [[Amazon rainforest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Corbillón |first1=Antonio |title=En el Amazonas sin mapas, guía, ni GPS |url=https://www.eldiariomontanes.es/on-extra/201703/19/amazonas-mapas-guia-20170318190826.html |work=El Diario Montañes |date=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later Ricardo Armbruster reappeared in [[Tenerife]], on the [[Canary Islands]]. He had made a living by hunting in the forest, making research films, helping national armies explore new territories and, in the end, smuggling coffee to pay for a ship fare back to Europe.

Back in Spain, Ricardo Armbruster settled down, married Erika Born, another German/Spanish national, and had two children: Yaukuma (named after a [[Mehinako people|Mehinaku]] Indian of the [[Xingu River|Xingú River]] Basin) and Thurit Armbruster. The couple moved to [[Valladolid]], in the north of Spain, where Ricardo Armbruster became a successful entrepreneur but was mostly recognized for his activist ecologism and political positioning (against the [[Spanish State]] of [[caudillo]] [[Francisco Franco]].

Ricardo Armbruster was one of the driving forces behind the creation of the [[AEORMA]] ecologist group, a strictly forbidden activity under the [[Francoist State]]. He was also, with Julio Valdeón Baruque, José Luis Martín, José Luis Barrigón, Carlos Santamaría, Carlos Carrasco, Manuel Conde and others, the driving force behind the creation of the [[Instituto Regional Castellano-Leonés]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Adiós a Rafa Álvarez-Taladriz, pionero del ecologismo |url=http://ultimocero.com/noticias/2016/11/03/adios-a-rafa-alvarez-taladriz-pionero-del-ecologismo/ |publisher=Ultimocero |date=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an autonomy-enhancing entity that was subject to severe persecution by Franco´s authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Berzal |first1=Enrique |title=Gran medievalista, profesor e impulsor de Castilla y León |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/06/22/opinion/16330706.html |work=El Mundo |date=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;Historia del movimiento castellano leonés&gt;

Erika and Ricardo Armbruster's home in the Castillian countryside ([[La Corala]]) soon became a preferred stop for zoologists and naturalists in the early 1970s, who brought over every kind of fauna to be treated and cured. This made the premises look more like a zoo than a private home. The property also became a hot spot for debates about democracy and ecology among Spanish intellectuals, artists and oligarchs who appreciated Armbruster's views on these subjects.

A rebel [[Christian]] (he married under scrutiny and press coverage following the [[Catholic]] and [[Lutheran]] rituals at a time of [[National Catholicism]] in Spain), Ricardo Armbruster died on Easter Sunday in April 1976, at the age of 32, in [[Ribadesella]], [[Asturias]] (Spain), while scuba diving in search of eels and other sea species in the cold waters of the [[Cantabrian Sea]].&lt;El Norte de Castilla&gt;

'''Richard Davoud Donchian''' (born September 1905, [[Hartford, Connecticut]] – d. 1993) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]]-American [[commodity market|commodities]] and [[Futures contract|futures]] [[trader (finance)|trader]],  and pioneer in the field of [[managed futures]].

The first publicly managed futures fund, ''Futures, Inc.'', was started in 1949 by Richard Donchian. He also developed the [[Trend following|trend timing]] method of futures investing and introduced the [[mutual fund]] concept to the field of [[Investment management|money management]].

Richard Donchian is considered to be the creator of the managed futures industry and is credited with developing a systematic approach to futures money management. His professional trading career was dedicated to advancing a more conservative approach to futures trading.

==Biography==
Richard's parents were Armenian immigrants from [[Western Armenia]] which was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] back in the 1880s and had come to settle in the USA. As a young man Richard went to school in Connecticut, later graduating from [[Yale University]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in [[Economics]]. He later receives his MBA from [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. Richard's first taste of the job market was as an assistant in his family’s [[Oriental rug]] business.

During this time Richard came across the fictionalized [[biography]] of stock market whiz [[Jesse Lauriston Livermore|Jesse Livermore]] titled ''[[Reminiscences of a Stock Operator]]'', After reading this book Richard became so fascinated that his interest turned to studying the financial markets. During the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|market crash of 1929]] he lost some money. This experience led him to study [[technical analysis]] and become a student of price history alone and for its own sake.

Richard began his [[Wall Street]] career in the 1930s. He published a very popular stock market service called ''Security Pilot'' which he sold to [[brokerage firm|brokerage houses]]. During the summer of 1933 he became an account executive and [[Securities research|securities analyst]] with ''Hemphill, Noyes and Co'', while still working as the Vice President of the ''Samuel Rug Company''.

World War II would take Richard into the US military and participation in the invasion of Sicily.  He was later promoted to Air Force statistical officer. After the War he became a private investment adviser and securities analyst. Richard was self-employed until 1960. In 1948 he changed his focus from securities analysis to active trading and developing his rule based technical system. He established the trading firm ''Futures, Inc.'', which was then one of the first publicly held commodity funds.

Richard developed a rule based trading approach which became known as [[Trend following]]. It is based on the assumption that commodity prices moved in long, sustained moves. Richard developed and used a trading system that incorporated ''Trading rules'', ''Trading guidelines'', and his ''weekly rule system'' based on [[Moving average (technical analysis)|moving averages]]. He wrote many articles on futures trading and securities and became known as ''the father of trend following''.

In 1960 Richard was appointed Director of Commodity Research with [[Hayden Stone]] where he commenced writing a weekly newsletter, Commodity Trend Timing, based on his 5-20 moving average method. His newsletter was very popular, reaching a weekly circulation of some 10,000 copies during the 19 years he wrote it. Richard wrote numerous articles which are considered industry classics, including ''Trend Following Methods in Commodity Price Analysis''.  Richard would remain with [[Hayden Stone]]'s various successors, including [[Shearson/American Express]], and later joined ''[[Shearson Lehman Brothers]]'', eventually becoming Vice President of the firm.

During his career he was a member of several exchanges, such as the ''New York Cotton Exchange'', and several professional market associations, such as the New York Society of Security Analysts.

Many modern trend following systems, such as the ''Turtle Trading system'', are based on his work. The '''Richard Davoud Donchian Foundation''' was established after his death in April 1993; its aim is to make improvements in Children's Health and to help its ultimate recipients become empowered to strengthen and build up their families and communities — passing onto others that which was given to them.

'''Robert T. Davies''' (May 19, 1849 - March 22, 1916) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman and [[thoroughbred]] and [[standardbred]] [[horse racing|racehorse]] owner and [[Horse breeding|breeder]].

Born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], he studied at Park School and [[Upper Canada College]], in the early 1870s Robert Davies married Margaret Anne Taylor, the daughter of [[John Taylor (paper manufacturer)|John Taylor]], owner of [[paper mill]]s in [[Todmorden Mills|Todmorden Mills, Ontario]], just north of Toronto. By the turn of the century, they had eight children and owned a large home at 244 Don Mills Rd (now Broadview/O'Connor) in [[Todmorden Mills]] they called "Chester Park."

Davies' brother Thomas Davies owned the [[Don Brewery]] at Queen Street at the Don River, which Robert helped manage. In 1877, Robert Davies founded the competing [[Dominion Brewery]] only two blocks to the west on Queen Street. Ten years later, his success led to the selling of shares in the company to a group of investors arranged by a [[London]], [[England]] banking house. After his wife's family encountered financial difficulties, in 1901 Davies acquired most of the Taylor family holdings in the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don Valley]], including two [[paper mills]] and the [[Don Valley Brick Works]]. By the time of his death in 1916, Robert Davies was one of the wealthiest people in Toronto.

==Thoroughbred racing==
As a boy, Robert Davies developed a love for [[horse racing]] and for a while was on [[jockey]] in Thoroughbred [[flat racing]]. In 1865 at the racetrack in [[London, Ontario]], the then sixteen-year-old rode in that year's edition of the [[Queen's Plate]]. He soon turned to training his own horses and at age twenty-two raced and trained [[Floss (horse)|Floss]] who won the 1871 edition of the Plate. The following year, a horse he bred named [[Fearnaught]] won the Plate. As of 2008 Robert Davies is the only person to ever ride in the Queen's Plate as well as own, train and breed winners of that race.

Davies purchased the filly [[Southern Maid (horse)|Southern Maid]] from [[Kentucky]] breeder, [[John E. Madden]]. A daughter of 1898 [[Kentucky Derby]] winner, [[Plaudit]], Southern Maid was voted the retrospective [[American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly]] of 1913. As a broodmare for the Davies family, she produced 1922 [[Queen's Plate|King's Plate]] winner, [[South Shore (horse)|South Shore]].

In 1888, Davies purchased a large property in the Don Valley from his father-in-law on which he established a breeding operation he dubbed Thorncliffe Farms.  He raced horses both in Thoroughbred [[flat racing]] and in [[harness racing]] under the ''[[Glossary of North American horse racing|nom de course]]'', [[Thorncliffe Stable]].

Davies served as president of the Canadian Horse Breeder's Association. A vice-president of the [[Ontario Jockey Club]] from 1895 to 1904, he unsuccessfully lobbied for the lifting of the rule that prevented horses foaled outside of the [[Province of Ontario]] from competing in the [[Queen's Plate|King's Plate]].

Robert Davies died in 1916 at "Chester Park" and was buried in the [[Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto|Mount Pleasant Cemetery]] in Toronto. For his contribution to the industry, in 2001 he was inducted in the [[Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame]] in the Builders category. His estate sold Thorncliffe Farms to a group of investors from [[Baltimore, Maryland]] who built a horse [[Thorncliffe Park#Thorncliffe Park Raceway|Thorncliffe Park Raceway]].

Davie's [[Dominion Brewery]] complex at Queen Street East and Sumach Street continued until 1936, but the brewery complex was renovated from 1987 to 1990 and is now Dominion Square (and used by Vistek as commercial office space) and the old [[Dominion Hotel, Toronto|Dominion Hotel]] is now home to the pub Dominion on Queen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2995">The '''Ron Brown Award for Corporate Leadership''' is a U.S. presidential honor to recognize companies "for the exemplary quality of their relationships with employees and communities".  It is presented to companies that "have demonstrated a deep commitment to innovative initiatives that not only empower employees and communities but also advance strategic business interests".

==Establishment==
President [[Bill Clinton]], along with prominent business leaders, established the award in 1997 following [[Ron Brown (U.S. politician)|Ron Brown]]'s death in a [[1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash|plane crash in 1996]]. The award was originally referred to as [[Ron Brown Corporate Citizenship Award]]. [[The Conference Board]], a non-profit organization, was chosen to manage the award's administration. Ron Brown was the [[U.S. Secretary of Commerce]] from 1993–1996; he was the first African-American to hold that position.  This award and the [[Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award]] are the two presidential awards to corporations.

==Ceremony==
The award is presented in an annual White House ceremony, either by the President or by the Secretary of Commerce.

[[Gareth Gates]] who has performed together with Siti during MTV Asia Awards 2004 when he was asked what does he think about Siti, he said, "She definitely has the looks and she certainly has the voice.

The '''Society for Economic Measurement''', or '''SEM''', is a scientific [[learned society]] in the field of [[economics]]. It was founded on August 24, 2013 by [[William A. Barnett]] in order to "promote research on economic measurement, using advanced tools from economic theory, econometrics, aggregation theory, experimental economics, mathematics, and statistics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sem.society.cmu.edu/home.html SEM Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nobel Laureate [[James Heckman]] will take over as the society's second president in 2019 for a three-year term in office. The goal of the SEM is to promote in economics—given the constraints of a [[social science]]—the implementation of the strict rules of measurement and data gathering standards used in the [[physical sciences]].

|[[File:Nsa-ig-draft-report.pdf|thumb|2009 OIG Draft Report on Stellar Wind]]
|}
"'''Stellar Wind'''" (or "'''Stellarwind'''") was the [[code name]] of a warrantless surveillance program begun under the [[George W. Bush administration]]'s [[President's Surveillance Program]] (PSP).&lt;ref name =OIG1&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/27/nsa-inspector-general-report-document-data-collection NSA Inspector General report on the President's Surveillance Program], March 24, 2009, page 10, note 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) program was approved by [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] shortly after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], and was revealed by [[Thomas Tamm]] to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref name=TimeMueller&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2067995-2,00.html "Is the FBI Up to the Job 10 Years After 9/11?"] April 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsweek1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/174601|title=The Fed Who Blew the Whistle: Is he a hero or a criminal?|last=Isikoff|first=Michael|date=December 13, 2008|work=Newsweek|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215105850/http://www.newsweek.com/id/174601|archivedate=December 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stellar Wind was a prelude to new legal structures that allowed President Bush and President [[Barack Obama]] to reproduce each of those programs and expand their reach.&lt;ref name=wapoarch&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-surveillance-architecture-includes-collection-of-revealing-internet-phone-metadata/2013/06/15/e9bf004a-d511-11e2-b05f-3ea3f0e7bb5a_story.html|title=U.S. surveillance architecture includes collection of revealing Internet, phone metadata|work=The Washington Post|date=June 16, 2013|first=Barton|last=Gellman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program scope ==
The program's activities involved [[data mining]] of a large database of the communications of American citizens, including e-mail communications, telephone conversations, financial transactions, and internet activity.&lt;ref name="newsweek1"/&gt; [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], a retired technical leader with the NSA, discussed some of the architectural and operational elements of the program at the [[Chaos Communication Congress|2012 Chaos Communication Congress]].&lt;ref name="newsweek2"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Binney, William |title=29C3 Panel: Jesselyn Radack, Thomas Drake, William Binney on whistleblowing and surveillance |medium=YouTube Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDM3MqHln8U |accessdate=June 9, 2013 |format=Flash |time=1:03:00 |publisher=Chaos Communication Congress |location=Hamburg, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intelligence community also was able to obtain from the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] suspicious activity reports, or "SARS", which are reports of activities such as large cash transactions that are submitted by financial institutions under anti-money laundering rules.&lt;ref name="newsweek1" /&gt;

There were internal disputes within the [[U.S. Justice Department]] about the legality of the program, because data is collected for large numbers of people, not just the subjects of [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) warrants.&lt;ref name="newsweek3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/174602|title=Now We Know What the Battle Was About|last=Klaidman|first=Daniel |date=December 13, 2008|work=Newsweek|archiveurl=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/12/13/now-we-know-what-the-battle-was-about.html|archivedate=November 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =ars1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/07/what-the-ashcroft-hospital-showdown-on-nsa-spying-was-all-about/|title=What the Ashcroft 'Hospital Showdown' on NSA spying was all about|author=Sanchez, Julian|date=July 29, 2013|accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Bush Administration, the Stellar Wind cases were referred to by FBI agents as "pizza cases" because many seemingly suspicious cases turned out to be food takeout orders. According to then-[[FBI Director]] [[Robert Mueller]], approximately 99% of the cases led nowhere, but "it's that other 1% that we've got to be concerned about".&lt;ref name=TimeMueller/&gt;

== 2004 conflict ==
From a report by the inspectors general of six US intelligence agencies that was declassified in September 2015, it became clear that President Bush had originally authorized the collection of telephone and e-mail metadata only if one end of the communications was foreign or when there was a link to terrorism. But in 2004, the Justice Department found out that the NSA was apparently also collecting the metadata of purely domestic communications, after which President Bush declared that NSA had always been allowed to do so, but that analysts were only allowed to look at metadata related to terrorism. With this revised formulation, Bush reauthorized the program on March 11, 2004.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2015-09-20/&gt;

In 2004, the head of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), [[Jack Landman Goldsmith]], wrote at least two legal memos authorizing the program, "We conclude only that when the nation has been thrust into an armed conflict by a foreign attack on the United States and the president determines in his role as commander in chief ... that it is essential for defense against a further foreign attack to use the [wiretapping] capabilities of the [National Security Agency] within the United States, he has inherent constitutional authority" to order warrantless wiretapping—"an authority that Congress cannot curtail," Goldsmith wrote in a 108-page memo dated May 6, 2004. In March 2004, the OLC concluded the e-mail program was not legal, and then-Acting Attorney General [[James Comey]] refused to reauthorize it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=Legal memos released on Bush-era justification for warrantless wiretapping|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/legal-memos-released-on-bush-era-justification-for-warrantless-wiretapping/2014/09/05/91b86c52-356d-11e4-9e92-0899b306bbea_story.html|work=Washington Post|date=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revelations ==
In March 2012 ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine published "The NSA Is Building the Country's Biggest Spy Center (Watch What You Say)" talking about a vast new [[Utah Data Center|NSA facility in Utah]] and said, "For the first time, a former NSA official has gone on the record to describe the program, codenamed Stellarwind, in detail," naming the official William Binney, a former NSA code breaker. Binney went on to say that the NSA had highly secured rooms that tap into major switches, and satellite communications at both AT&amp;T and Verizon.&lt;ref name="Wired Magazine" &gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/all/1|title=The NSA Is Building the Country's Biggest Spy Center (Watch What You Say)|last=Bamford|first=James|date=March 15, 2012|work=Wired|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article suggested that the supposedly-terminated Stellar Wind continues as an active program. This conclusion was supported by the exposure of [[Room 641A]] in AT&amp;T's operations center in San Francisco in 2006.

In June 2013 the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' and the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' published an Office of the Inspector General ([[Office of Inspector General (United States)|OIG]]) draft report, dated March 2009, leaked by [[Edward Snowden]] detailing the Stellar Wind program.&lt;ref name =OIG1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/national-security-agency-inspector-general-draft-report/277/|title = NSA inspector general report on email and internet data collection under Stellar Wind|date= March 9, 2009|accessdate= August 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; No doubt remained about the continuing nature of the surveillance program.

In September 2014 ''[[The New York Times]]'' asserted, "Questions persist after the release of a newly declassified version of a legal memo approving the National Security Agency's Stellarwind program, a set of warrantless surveillance and data collection activities secretly authorized after the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001]]." as an introductory headline summary with a link. The accompanying article addressed the release of a newly declassified version of the May 2004 memo.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Charlie, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/redactions-in-us-memo-leave-doubts-on-data-surveillance-program.html?emc=edit_th_20140907&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=68634180&amp;_r=0 "Redactions in U.S. Memo Leave Doubts on Data Surveillance Program"], ''The New York Times'', Sunday, September 7, 2014, p. A17&lt;/ref&gt; Note was made that the bulk of the program—the telephone, Internet, and e-mail surveillance of American citizens—remained secret until the revelations by [[Edward Snowden]], that to date, significant portions of the memo remain redacted in the newly released version, and that doubts and questions about its legality persist.

'''Mosima Gabriel "Tokyo" Sexwale''' ({{IPA-all|sexwále|[[Venda language|Venda]]:}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2011/11/sexwale.html|title=Sexwale|last=Wells|first=John C.|authorlink=John C. Wells|date=22 November 2011|work=Phonetic blog|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; born 5 March 1953) is a South African businessman, politician, anti-[[apartheid]] activist, and former [[political prisoner]]. Sexwale was imprisoned on [[Robben Island]] for his anti-apartheid activities, alongside figures such as [[Nelson Mandela]]. After the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 general election]]&amp;mdash;the first fully democratic election in South Africa&amp;mdash;Sexwale became the [[Premier of Gauteng|Premier]] of [[Gauteng Province]]. He served in the government of [[South Africa]] as [[Department of Human Settlements|Minister of Human Settlements]] from 2009 to 2013.

==Early life and education==
Sexwale was born in the township of [[Orlando West]], in [[Soweto]]. His father was a clerk at [[Johannesburg General Hospital]] and had fought against the Germans in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leung|first1=Rebecca|title=Comrade Capitalist|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/comrade-capitalist/|accessdate=28 October 2015|publisher=CBS News|date=26 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexwale grew up amid the turmoil of the black [[Township (South Africa)|township]]'s upheaval, and graduated from Orlando West High School in 1973.

Sexwale became a member of the [[Steve Biko]]'s [[Black Consciousness Movement]] in the late 1960s and became a local leader of the radical South African Students' Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:r37SxKhanQcJ:www.sundayworld.co.za/lifestyle/2017/06/22/the-good-looking-side-of-politics-photos+&amp;cd=15&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=za|title=The good looking side of politics (Photos) - SundayWorld|last=World|first=Sunday|website=webcache.googleusercontent.com|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, he joined the African National Congress's armed wing, [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] ("spear of the nation").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/mosima-gabriel-tokyo-sexwale|title=Mosima Gabriel (Tokyo) Sexwale|last=Anonymous|date=2011-02-17|work=South African History Online|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in [[Swaziland]], he completed a Certificate in Business Studies at the [[University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=7vdiDgAAQBAJ|title=Thabo Mbeki and the Battle for the Soul of the ANC|last=Gumede|first=William Mervin|date=2008-05-15|publisher=Zed Books Ltd.|isbn=9781848132597|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Sexwale went into [[exile]], undergoing military officers' training in the [[Soviet Union]], where he specialized in [[military engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/18/tokyo-sexwale-blatter-ferdinand|title=Who is Tokyo Sexwale, subject of the Blatter-Ferdinand Twitter row?|last=Smith|first=David|date=2011-11-18|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
Upon his return to South Africa in 1976, Sexwale was captured after a skirmish with the South African security forces and, along with 11 others, was charged and later convicted of [[terrorism]] and [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to overthrow the government after an almost two-year-long trial in the [[Supreme Court of South Africa]] in [[Pretoria]].{{fact|date=August 2017}} In 1977, Sexwale was sent to the [[Robben Island]] maximum-security prison to serve an 18-year sentence.{{fact|date=August 2017}} While imprisoned at Robben Island, he studied for a [[BCom]] degree at the [[University of South Africa]].{{fact|date=August 2017}} Sexwale was released in June 1990 under the terms of the [[Groote Schuur Agreement]] between the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government and the African National Congress.{{fact|date=August 2017}} He had spent 13 years in prison.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

During this time he was represented in part by a paralegal named Judy van Vuuren.{{fact|date=August 2017}} They began a personal relationship while he remained in prison, and soon after his release, in 1990, they married.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

==Political career==
After his release, Sexwale returned to Johannesburg, where he served as head of the public liaison department of the African National Congress Headquarters. He was subsequently appointed the head of special projects, reporting to the ANC's military headquarters. In September 1990, he was elected as a member of the executive committee of the ANC in the [[Pretoria]]-[[Witwatersrand]]-[[Vereeniging]] (PWV) region. He became the chairperson of the ANC in the PWV region in 1991, a position he held until his resignation in late 1997.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

After the South African elections in April 1994, Sexwale was elected as the first premier of the new PWV Province (renamed Gauteng Province in December 1994). In this role, he was credited with bringing peace to several politically volatile townships. Sexwale left politics for the corporate sector in 1998. The reasons for this were never made completely clear, but was reportedly due to feeling stifled by central government restrictions as well as becoming exhausted by internal African National Congress intrigues.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Further speculation is that Sexwale left politics due to strong disagreements with the then Vice-President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Other speculation is that his marriage opened business opportunities in the white-dominated financial sectors that allowed him opportunities not open to other black leaders.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Sexwale, Cyril Ramaphosa and Mbeki were possible candidates jostling for the presidency after Mandela stepped down. Once Thabo Mbeki appeared as the favourite candidate, both Sexwale and Ramaphosa left politics to follow successful careers as businessmen.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

On 7 January 2007, ''[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|The Sunday Times]]'' reported that Sexwale was campaigning for a leadership position within the ANC, which would have put him in position to replace Thabo Mbeki as [[President of South Africa]] in 2009. Sexwale admitted on BBC's Hard Talk that if asked to stand for the elections as party president by structures of the ANC, he would seriously consider it.&lt;ref name=ANC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6238913.stm Tycoon may run for top ANC post] BBC 8 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the ANC's 80-member National Executive Committee in December 2007 in 10th place, with 2,198 votes.&lt;ref&gt;Brendan Boyle, [http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=666599 "Winnie Mandela tops ANC election list"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002120731/http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=666599 |date=2 October 2008 }}, ''The Times'' (South Africa), 21 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 2009, President Jacob Zuma appointed Sexwale as Minister of Human Settlements,&lt;ref name=Minister&gt;[http://architectafrica.com/tokyo-sexwale Tokyo Sexwale to head South Africa's New Housing Ministry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817065541/http://architectafrica.com/tokyo-sexwale |date=17 August 2011 }} Architect Africa 10 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; a ministry which replaced the Department of Housing.

===Mvelaphanda Group===
Upon leaving the public sector, Sexwale founded [[Mvelaphanda Group|Mvelaphanda Holdings]] (''mvelaphanda'' is the [[Venda language|Venda]] word for "progress"), a company of which he is still executive chairman. Mvelaphanda is primarily focused on the mining, energy and related sectors. Some of Sexwale's main interests are oil and [[diamond mining]], for which he has been granted concessions across Africa and Russia; these interests are controlled by a subsidiary of Mvelaphanda Holdings called Mvelaphanda Resources, of which he is chairman.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

Through his [[Mvelaphanda Group]] Tokyo Sexwale has substantial holdings in the mining sector. He is currently discussing with the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]]-owned [[Eurasian National Resources Corporation]] a plan to buy into mining interests in Guinea. A negotiating team is in secret talks about financing a local mining company to be owned by the Guinean state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201206071290.html Africa Confidential, "South Africa: Higher Taxes, Less Nationalisation",'' AllAfrica '' (8 June 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The new mining code, drafted by advisers to the Guinean President [[Alpha Condé]], would grant the new state entity a free 15% stake in Guinea’s mining projects, with the option to buy another 20%. Tokyo Sexwale was a business partner with Alpha Condé even before Condé became president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/south-african-oligarch-beats-oleg-deripaska-to-the-pot-in-guinea-2012-6 John Helmer," South African Oligarch Beats Oleg Deripaska To The Pot In Guinea", ''Business Insider'' (13 June 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexwale’s Mvelphanda Holdings and Walter Hennig's Palladino Holdings have entered into a partnership with US investment fund managers Och-Ziff Capital Management in [[African Global Capital]], a natural resources investment fund focussing on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2012-06-28-tokyo-linked-company-in-guinea-row/|title=Tokyo-linked company in Guinea row|last=Wood|first=Craig McKune, Stefaans Brummer &amp; James|work=The M&amp;G Online|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa Management Limited===
In January 2008 [[Och-Ziff#Subsidiaries|OZ Management]], [[Mvelaphanda Group|Mvelaphanda (Mvela) Holdings]] and [[Walter Hennig]]’s [[Palladino Holdings]] announced the creation of a new joint venture, [[Africa Management Limited]].&lt;ref name="OZ"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shareholders.ozcap.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=213764&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1101494&amp;highlight=|title=OZM - Overview|website=shareholders.ozcap.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As part of the joint venture, Africa Management Limited established [[African Global Capital]], as a vehicle for investment in both the private and public markets across Africa, focusing on natural resources and related opportunities.&lt;ref name=OZ /&gt;
Tokyo Sexwale said: "We intend to build on our already strong foothold in African investments in partnership with Och-Ziff. The partnership with Och-Ziff in African Global Capital will help us accelerate in building the leading African investment firm."&lt;ref name=OZ /&gt;

==Presidential ambitions==

He was mentioned as a possible candidate for [[Deputy President]] of the [[African National Congress]] in 2007. In September 2007 he announced his candidacy for the ANC Presidential nomination at the party convention in [[Polokwane]]. Prior to the convention, he withdrew his nomination and backed then Deputy President - [[Jacob Zuma]]. He did not stand for the Deputy Presidency as certain media speculation expected,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} the post eventually going to [[Kgalema Motlanthe]]. In 2009, he was appointed as Minister of Human Settlements by President Jacob Zuma having previously been touted as a possible Foreign Affairs or Defense Minister.

== 2012 ANC Leadership election ==

Sexwale was nominated as [[Kgalema Motlanthe]]'s Deputy Presidential running mate on 2 October 2012 by various regions in the [[Eastern Cape]], the ruling party's second largest branch. The African National Congress Youth League also indicated that it would back Sexwale for the Deputy Presidency at the ANC's leadership election Manguang, Free State. On 18 December 2012, Sexwale was defeated for the post of Deputy President, coming in last place he received 463 votes while Cyril Ramaphosa received 3 018 votes and Mathews Phosa received 470 votes.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

== Personal life ==

His nickname of "[[Tokyo]]" is derived from his involvement with the sport of [[karate]] as a youth.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

Sexwale has two children by a first wife, and two children by his second wife, Judy van Vuuren, a paralegal he met on Robben Island. Following his financial success, he moved into the previously predominantly white suburb of Illovo with his family. In 2013 Sexwale and his second wife filed for divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tokyo and Judy Sexwale in divorce battle|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/party/tokyo-and-judy-sexwale-in-divorce-battle|accessdate=28 October 2015|publisher=Politicsweb.co.za|date=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bird|first1=William|title=Sexwale divorce: The naming of names is a difficult matter|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2013-02-18-sexwale-divorce-the-naming-of-names-is-a-difficult-matter/#.VjEW0Sum2J8|accessdate=28 October 2015|publisher=Daily Maverick|date=18 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days after the death of Mandela, on 8 December 2013, Sexwale appeared at a prayer service in Houghton, South Africa, where he hailed Mandela as the "purest of the purest good" and encouraged everyone to learn from his example: "His method was that of solving a society's most impractical problems through talking and engaging."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Sexwale-Mandela-purest-of-the-purest-of-good-20131208].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

In 2001 Sexwale was accused, along with [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] and [[Mathews Phosa]], of plotting to depose President [[Thabo Mbeki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-05-05-sexwale-threatens-legal-action-over-coup-plot-report |title=Sexwale vows to set his lawyers on 'coup plot' pedlars &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; National &amp;#124; Mail &amp; Guardian |publisher=Mg.co.za |date=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexwale denied the charges and all three received the backing of Nelson Mandela; they were later exonerated from all accusations.

In 2002, he was refused a visa to enter the United States, which kept him from attending the listing of [[Gold Fields]] (a company in which he holds a 15 percent stake) on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. It later transpired that he, along with many prominent South African anti-apartheid figures such as Nelson Mandela and South African cabinet minister [[Sidney Mufamadi]], were still on that country's list of global terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-testimony-subcommittee-national-security-emerging-threats-and-international-r |title=ACLU Testimony Before the Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats, and International Relations Regarding Censorship At the Borders &amp;#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date=2006-03-28 |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initiating legal action, going so far as to having papers served on the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] and following personal intervention by [[Condoleezza Rice]], Sexwale and the others received ten-year waivers from the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], as the government felt that permanently delisting them would mean changing the law, which would be a lengthy process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall |first=Mimi |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-04-30-watchlist_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip |title=U.S. has Mandela on terrorist list - USATODAY.com |publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date=2008-04-30 |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008 the waiver was lifted and the ANC members along with the ANC were removed from the terrorist list in the US.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

In 2005, Sexwale was roundly criticized for being "indecisive" during the live finale of the South African version of ''[[The Apprentice (TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', which he fronted on SABC3.  Both finalists, Zanele Batyashe, 24, and Khomotso Choma, 34, were hired in the finale which aired 22 September.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tashitagg.com/apprentice/luke/eps15.asp Indecisively Yours] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513234501/http://www.tashitagg.com/apprentice/luke/eps15.asp |date=13 May 2006 }} Blog&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexwale's name appeared in a United Nations report on illegal transactions under the [[Oil-for-Food Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaytimes.co.za/article.aspx?ID=353438 Tokyo guns for presidency]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Sunday Times, 8 January 2007 (pay for access, 16 March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexwale's Group 5 has received criticism for their involvement with [[Gugulethu]] Tycoon, [[Mzoli Ngcawuzele]] in the Guguletu Square Mall.&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-11-20-david-vs-goliath-in-gugulethu |title=David vs Goliath in Gugulethu|publisher=Mail&amp;Guardian |date=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009 Sexwale was criticized by some civil society organizations and academics for what they called 'publicity stunts'&lt;ref&gt;Cut the stunts and do something real {{dead link|url=http://www.sowetan.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=1047617|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for accusing protesting communities of fomenting 'anarchy' and threatened 'zero tolerance' against protesters 'acting under other flags.'&lt;ref&gt;Gaye Davis, [http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=124&amp;art_id=vn20090701051810350C862668 Sexwale warns unruly protesters], ''Iol news'', 1 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmg.org.za/print/17073 Media Briefing by Minister on Human Settlements Budget] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922185056/http://www.pmg.org.za/print/17073 |date=22 September 2009 }}, ''Parliamentary Monitoring Group'', 29 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaye Davis, [http://antieviction.org.za/2009/07/06/sexwale-slams-families-protesting-against-government-oppression-and-corruptipon/ Sexwale slams families protesting against government oppression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921170640/http://antieviction.org.za/2009/07/06/sexwale-slams-families-protesting-against-government-oppression-and-corruptipon/ |date=21 September 2009 }}, ''Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign'', 6 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guinea===

Sexwale is leading a group of South Africans who have devised a plan to take over mineral assets and mining concessions in the [[republic of Guinea]], which the Guinean government plans to renationalize after revoking deals struck by previous governments in power.&lt;ref name="BI"&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/south-african-oligarch-beats-oleg-deripaska-to-the-pot-in-guinea-2012-6 John Helmer, "South African Oligarch Beats Oleg Deripaska To The Pot In Guinea", ''Business Insider'' (13 June 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexwale is believed to be the driver behind two [[British Virgin Island]] vehicles, [[Palladino Holdings]] and [[Floras Bell]], which are managed by [[Walter Hennig]].&lt;ref name="BI" /&gt; In April 2011 Walter Hennig concluded a secret deal with the Guinean President [[Alpha Condé]] that would transfer billions of Dollars of mining assets belonging to companies such as [[BHP Billiton]] and [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] - who want to invest billions to develop the mines of Guinea – to South African intermediary [[Palladino Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guineenews.org%2Farticles%2Fdetail_article.asp%3Fnum%3D20126221329 Boubacar Bah Caba, "Major Issues: Conde accused of having sold off the Guinean mining interests in favor of South African ... for $ 25 million", ''Guineenews'' (2 June 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The deal comprised a loan of US$25 million to the Guinean government to finance the start-up of a new Guinean state mining company.&lt;ref name="BI" /&gt; Behind [[Walter Hennig]] and the $25 million loan agreement, are Sexwale; [[Mark Willcox]], the chief executive of [[Mvelaphanda Group]], and several other businessmen of South African, Polish, and British extraction. One of them is [[Ian Hannam]] a famous London banker who tried to arrange [[Rusal]]’s float on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in 2007, but failed.&lt;ref name="BI" /&gt;

The loan deal is now tipped for a potential investigation by the [[World Bank]] which would look into whether the loan was actually intended to finance a new state-mining company, as outlined in the contract, or to benefit political or individual interests in return for mining concessions.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2012-06-28-tokyo-linked-company-in-guinea-row/|title=Tokyo-linked company in Guinea row|last=Wood|first=Craig McKune, Stefaans Brummer &amp; James|work=The M&amp;G Online|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahmoud Thiam]], the former Guinean mining minister and political opponent of President Alpha Condé, claimed that Tokyo Sexwale "was angry with the president because he was not delivering on his promises" and that Tokyo was funding the president's election campaign through the loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2012-06-28-tokyo-linked-company-in-guinea-row/|title=Tokyo-linked company in Guinea row|last=Wood|first=Craig McKune, Stefaans Brummer &amp; James|work=The M&amp;G Online|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, the Russian publication Аргументы и Факты (Argumenty I Fakty, Arguments and Facts) reported that Walter Hennig, through [[Palladino Capital 2]], made a series of payments totalling $25 million to the Guinean president's son, Mohammed Condé.&lt;ref name="2faced"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http://www.aif.ru/society/article/53627|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The payments were made by Walter Hennig from an account held in [[Turks and Caicos Islands|Turks and Caicos]] into an offshore account held by Mohammed Condé in [[Monaco]].&lt;ref name=2faced /&gt;

The money was originally lent by Hennig's offshore company, Palladino Capital 2, in order to start the state mining company but various news articles have cited anonymous sources who have claimed that the US$25 million was never reflected in the country’s accounts.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"/&gt; When faced with these accusations, Sexwale has declined to comment personally and instead has released statements through his spokesperson [[Xolani Xundu]] that he would not confirm or deny any of the claims from "faceless sources".&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.news24.com/citypress/Business/News/Tokyos-Guinea-deal-stirs-a-storm-20120623 Jacques Dommisse, "Media reports in the West African state reveal that the ‘secret deal’ was never disclosed despite a promise for absolute transparency on state deals", City Press (24 June 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Women of Krusha e Madhe.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The Women of Krusha e Madhe "Drita e Krushes"]]

'''The Women of Krusha e Madhe''' ({{IPA|/ˈkruʃa e maðe/}}; {{lang-sq|Gratë e Krushës së Madhe}}; {{lang-sr|Жене у Великој Круши}}) are known as the Widowed Women of [[Kosovo]] because of the [[Massacre at Krusha e Madhe|massacre]] that occurred in their village. Throughout the dates 25, 26 and 27 of March in 1999 during the [[Kosovo War]], most of the men were killed from the [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Army]]. The women and children fled [http://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=501645&amp;fid=3574&amp;c=kosovo Krushe e Madhe] and headed to the Albanian border. Once the war was over and they returned, their entire village was flat because all their houses, schools, etc. had been burned to the ground.

These women who were now the heads of households decided to change their fate and become the income generators of the village. Not only did they bring in money for their families, but also drastically developed Krusha and its economy. When they returned, they lived in extreme poverty and horrible living conditions but through opening small businesses and continuously expanding their market share, they managed to get out of it. Although this village still needs growth and improvement.&lt;ref name="Helvetas"&gt;[http://easterneurope.helvetas.org/en/projects/kosovo/rural_employment_kosovo/], Helvetas Swiss Intercooperation (2002)Skills for Rural Employment Kosovo&lt;/ref&gt;  Maximum dexterity has been given by the women towards trying to help their families have a better life and seeing the village’s economy thrive.

===Location and population===

Krusha e Madhe is located in the municipality of [[Orahovac|Rahovec]], Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mcgill.ca/trauma-globalhealth/notes/kosovoindependence], Bittersweet Celebrations in Kosovo Trauma and Global Health Program McGill University. (n.d.).&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be the second biggest village in Kosovo.
The population of Krusha e Madhe is estimated to be around 7,000 citizens.&lt;ref name="koha-net"&gt;[http://www.koha.net/arkiva/?page=1,3,102847 Krusha e Madhe themelon kooperativën bujqësore], Koha.NET - Arkivi. (n.d.).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economy ===

The agricultural areas of Krusha e Madhe are rich with an overall of 630 hectares of fertile land.&lt;ref name="koha-net" /&gt; The fertile lands of Krusha e Madhe impact the economy. More than 16 hectares of the land are used for planting different vegetables, including 6 hectares of peppers, 2 hectares of potatoes, 2 hectares of onions and cucumbers, and other vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazetatribuna.com/?FaqeID=6&amp;LajmID=12977], Gazeta Tribuna. (n.d.).&lt;/ref&gt; An agricultural cooperative is currently open, which is mostly renowned for processed vegetables. Through it, farmers aim to increase the market share of vegetables in Kosovo and in neighboring countries.&lt;ref name="koha-net" /&gt; In general, Kosovo is rich with fertile land in which different vegetables and fruits are cultivated. Thus, Kosovo tends to be a country with a variety of traditional recipes and common vegetables such as [[ajvar]], pickles, cheese and other dairy products. After the war and [[Massacre at Krusha e Madhe]] in 1999, the women of Krusha e Madhe formed multiple women’s associations and presented themselves to the marketplace by selling pickles alone at the beginning. Afterwards, they managed to expand their market share by opening micro-enterprises such as Apetiti, "Krushe" cooperative, and Drita e Krushes. These small businesses are supplied with processed vegetables and other traditional.

The people of Krusha e Madhe have witnessed one of the greatest war disasters of the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999. The interesting yet tragic fact about the [[Massacre at Krusha e Madhe]] is that most, if not all, of the men there were killed and most of their bodies have still not been found.&lt;ref name="HumanRights"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/Kosovo/Kosovo-Massacres4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607200233/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/Kosovo/Kosovo-Massacres4.htm |archivedate=2009-06-07 |df= }}, Human Rights Watch (1999).

===War crimes===

The war in Krusha e Madhe is noted to be a massacre due to the population indictment against the [[Serbian Armed Forces|Serbian Military]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/kosovo/5084374/Kosovo-War-Thousands-killed-as-Serb-forces-tried-to-keep-control-of-province.html], Tweedie , N. (2009). Kosovo War.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999, the village of Krusha e Madhe has been attacked by the Serbian armed forces and most of the territory was destroyed.  At first, it started with the residents of Krusha e Madhe being forced to leave their own village and once they did, the houses of these villagers were all burnt to their roots. The Serbian army ordered the male villagers to gather and line up. The men ranged from the age of 14 to 73.&lt;ref name="HumanRights" /&gt; Afterwards, their houses, personal documents, and valuables were burned. Most importantly, all of these men were Killed. Their families (women and children) were forced to leave the place and head to the forests near the village. Many immediately went in the direction of the country of [[Albania]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/354561.stm], BBC News (2001). Milosevic Indictment. Massacre at Krusha e Madhe&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casualties and missing people===

Two years after the devastation of the resident, there has been an exhibition held in Krusha e Madhe in which everything experienced from these villagers was presented. In this event, the massacre was being presented with different pictures, real skeletons, and executed bodies. There have been statistical data about this massacre and the overall number of these deaths throughout the dates 25, 26 and 27 March 1999. According to BBC news&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; approximately 105 Kosovo Albanian males were murdered by the Serbian Police and 793 houses were burned down. However, there are also a lot of people missing whose bodies were never found, so the number of casualties totals up to 241 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mcgill.ca/trauma-globalhealth/notes/kosovoindependence Bittersweet Celebrations in Kosovo], McGill University&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there were 8 massive graves, 2 crematoriums and many other individual graves.&lt;ref name="Historitetmerrit"&gt;[http://www.eastview.com/russian/books/product.asp?SKU=2134553B&amp;f_locale=&amp;active_tab=2], Gashi, S. (2001). Histori te tmerrit 1998 - 1999 : dosje krimesh te luftes, rrefime te grave.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, today there are 139 widows and approximately 500 children left as orphans.&lt;ref name="Historitetmerrit" /&gt;

Based on reports from [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and many other press accounts, Krusha e Madhe is considered to be one of the most damaged villages as a result of the 1999 war in Kosovo, and it is known to be the village of widowed women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/Under_Orders_En_Combined.pdf], Human Rights Watch. (2001). UNDER ORDERS War Crimes in Kosovo.&lt;/ref&gt; The women, in absence of their men, had to become the heads of households and protect their families. Years after the war, their houses were finally rebuilt, which was the first step towards recovery.&lt;ref name="Konushevci"&gt;[http://www.evropaelire.org/content/article/24922858.html Konushevci, A. (2013, March 8). Krushë: Lufta e gruas për të mbijetuar.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments and businesses==

After the war, some of the women of Krusha e Madhe established an association called “Widowed Women” (Grate e Veja) which initially wanted to focus on finding missing people from the region. After it received no attention or support, the women of the association decided to get to work and provide for their families. They started doing work that used to be done by the men like planting the soil and farming. The association quickly became well-known and was changed to the “Krusha” agricultural cooperative which sold vegetables and processed (canned) ones. As the requests multiplied, so did the number of workers and productions. There are currently around 25 women who work full-time with the help of almost a hundred others who contribute in different ways. Out of the 25 women, 23 of them are widows whose husbands are either missing or were killed during the Massacre of Krusha e Madhe. Today, the cooperative supplies 28 markets around Kosovo with different products that are based on traditional recipes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botasot.info/aktuale/214356/krushe-lufta-e-gruas-per-te-mbijetuar/], Bota Sot (2013, February 8) Lufta e gruas për të mbijetuar - Aktuale - Bota Sot&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although, even with the cooperative’s success, many of the families of Krusha still need social assistance to get by. This is mainly because the work they do is seasonal (when the crops grow). 
Women of Krusha e Madhe have changed their own fate. Before the women of this place changed the state of it and developed its economy, extreme poverty and horrible life conditions were the norm.  They gave their absolute maximum to help their families live a better, secure life.

The Rahovec municipality, [http://www.mbpzhr-ks.net/ Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Rural Development (MAFRD)], [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], and other sponsors, were all supporters of a workshop for farmers and the growing of their crops. Around €80,000 were invested in this workshop and 30 women of Krusha who are widows are hired full-time to work with the crops. The workshop's opening was on May 30, 2011 in Krusha e Madhe with various politicians and donors present.&lt;ref name="Rahovec"&gt;[http://kk.rks-gov.net/rahovec/Lajmet/Ne-Krushe-te-Madhe--u-hap-fabrika-per-perpunimin-e.aspx], Rahovec Municipality Webpage (2011, May 11) Në Krushë të Madhe u hap fabrika për përpunimin e perimeve&lt;/ref&gt; This investment in the village’s agriculture is considered to be one of the best initiatives by the MAFRD to help female farmers who suffered during the war provide a more secure future for their families. In this workshop, the village residents learn to take care of crops, use them to create final products, and then sell them in the markets. Before this project, the women of Krusha e Madhe worked by hand, but now, with donations from different organizations and ministries, they can work faster and more efficiently with the use of different machines.&lt;ref name="Rahovec"/&gt;  These investments are a huge success as Krusha e Madhe is a leader in the selling of vegetables like pickles, tomatoes, peppers, potatoes etc. It is also known for the production of [[ajvar]], a widely popular type of relish in Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Helvetas"/&gt; The opening of the new production line which included ajvar was made possible by additional donations from USAID and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Rural Development (MAFRD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://oneworldsee.org/sq/content/realizimi-i-planeve-te-biznesit-fituesit-te-gares-biznes-planet-ne-prizren-dhe-gjakove], Dyrmishi E.

Purchases and sales presented in the following table (Table 1) describe the detailed flow of "Ola" Enterprise and women processors from Krushe. One can clearly see the usefulness of this type of business model since the gross profit justifies the investments made initially.

===Drita e Krushes===

In 1999, the women of Krusha e madhe were left without homes and with no source of income. One of the first initiatives to help these women was from Ms. Ola Syla,&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:zIMG9g6eivAJ:www.gtrc-rks.org/data/other/VLERAT%25C3%258BGRAVETKOSOV%25C3%258BS.pdf+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk, Vlera te Grave te Kosoves]&lt;/ref&gt; the founder and manager of an NGO called "Drita e Krushes"&lt;ref name="Drita"&gt;[http://www.undp.org/content/dam/kosovo/docs/womenPub/Enterpreneurs_W.pdf], UNDP, &amp; Women Business Association (2010). Women’s Entrepreneurship Report. Twins - Pristina.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Drita e Krushes" representatives traveled from Prishtina to Krusha e Madhe for many times ever since 1999, in order to help the women who were left widows after the massacre of Krusha.  At first, they had to set up a non-governmental organization (NGO) in which the assistance would be donations from different international organizations. These projects were donor drive since the women of Krusha e Madhe had no previous experience in entrepreneurship. With the aids given, the goods were initially transported from Krusha e Madhe to the citizens of Prishtina. For four years, the goods were ordered from familiar people of heads of the organization and it got popular in that manner. However, this way of exporting goods was not efficient enough. With the help of Swiss InterCoropration the women of Krusha were supplied with jars to use for the processed vegetables. They were placed on shelves in a store which was opened in Prishtina in 2001. At that period, the production of processed vegetables was promoted and once it started, the business had great success. First they started off with a small room where 20 employees were hired and only 300&amp;nbsp;kg of peppers were available. Looking at the fact that these were sold out very fast, the quantity of production had to increase. In 2002, the women participated in the AgroKos fair, which is an agricultural fair which aims to give farmers the opportunity to present their crops and products. For their traditional recipes, the women of Krusha won the gold medal.&lt;ref name="Drita"/&gt;

For seven years in a row, "Drita e Krushes" was the only business in Kosovo selling traditional products and processed vegetables which were made in rural areas. In 2004, the business which was opened in Prishtina expanded with a depot and a working space due to the funds collected from donations. In this year, the store had 300 women employed working on the products. The women received a wage monthly and this income was used in a very beneficial way to develop their lives.&lt;ref name="Drita"/&gt;

In the initial phases of “Drita e Krushes”, its representatives in association with Helvetas Swiss Intercooperation organized various informal trainings for the women in the organization. This skills development program in Krusha had three main intervention strategies: Opportunity Groups (learning groups), Private Sector training and Supply Chain linkages.&lt;ref name="Helvetas"/&gt; The trainings were very basic and tackled matters like sanitation maintenance, reading and writing, and working with the machines donated from the organizations mentioned above.&lt;ref name="Helvetas"/&gt; The purpose of all this is to deliver enhanced services to developing communities, unemployed people, and private, small businesses like those in Krusha e Madhe.

===“Grate e veja” (The Widowed Women)===

In 2005, Fahrije Hoti from Krusha e Madhe, whose husband is still on the missing persons list, initiated an organization called “Grate e Veja” (The widowed Women), to seek assistance on investigation of the missing persons. However, achieving minimal results on revealing the fate of missing persons, the women of Krusha e madhe had to get back to their primary duties such as nurturing their children, normalize their life and generate income. In the same year, they started operating under the name of the organization, planting and renewing their lands. Soon they started producing traditional recipes and conserving winter food. With the demands rising, this organization expanded its producing capacities and started hiring more women.&lt;ref name="Konushevci" /&gt; This was important because with the help of various organizations, families of Krusha e Madhe could live their lives again with better life conditions.

===Association of the Widowed Women “Krusha”===

In 2010, “Grate e veja” was transformed in the agricultural cooperative called “Krusha", an independent non-profit organization (NGO). Its profits and any other income generated are used to support those in financial need and further expand their NGO. The main offices of “Krusha” are located in the village of Krusha e Madhe and in the Municipality of Rahovec. The official representative of this organization is Fahrije Hoti and there are in overall five members that make up the organization’s board. In addition, “Krusha” has both permanent and seasonal workers.&lt;ref name="Hoti"&gt;[http://ruralgrant.kdc-kosova.org/mod2.php?bnr=1, Hoti, F. (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The objectives of “Krusha”===

One of the primary goals of “Krusha” organization is to create the necessary conditions for the widowed women to run their businesses on their own. So far, positive results are seen regarding the development of women’s organizational and entrepreneurial skills. This has helped them to be engaged in cultivating their agricultural goods and be able to manage the economical as well as financial aspects of their businesses.&lt;ref name="Hoti"/&gt; One of the many projects of “Krusha” organization involved enabling women to receive driving licenses so that they would be more independent in terms of moving freely from the village to other business destinations. In addition, with the unique traditional recipe, this cooperative has managed to supply its products to approximately 28 markets in numerous cities of Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Hoti"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3392">A '''work card''' is like an [[Identity Card]] which verifies that a person has been given work, or is eligible to perform work in a given profession or jurisdiction. The work card is not a [[Visa (document)|work visa]], although it may be used in conjunction with a work visa, [[United States Permanent Resident Card|permanent resident card]] or other documentation.

Work cards are often used in countries with high [[unemployment]] to certify that the individual meets certain legal requirements (such as head of household, or with dependent children) making him or her eligible for work.

Work cards are also used in certain industries like [[construction]] (where specialized training and safety skills are required)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | publisher = Ontario Ministry of Labour | title = Workers Performing Specialized Construction Work | date = August 2006 | url = http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/about/ontque/fs_specialized.html | accessdate = 2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[gambling]] (where background and credit checks are required to reduce the incidence of crime).&lt;ref&gt;"ACLU Still Critical of State's Work Card Proposal," ''Gambling Magazine,'' September 10, 2002; "County Rethinks Work Card Requirements," ''Gambling Magazine,'' April 3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Work cards are used in some employment situations, such as [[prostitution]], so that government officials may track the number of workers in a given industry. Frequent renewal of work cards may also be required to ensure that workers undergo regular health check-ups, or to gather information on working conditions or the incident of crime (such as assault against the prostitute, or a prostitute's criminal background).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.elko.nv.us/codes/City_Municipal_Code/Title_4/9/13.html "Section 4-9-13: Work Permit Registration Requirements." Municipal Code, City of Elko, Nevada.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Work cards are increasingly used in the [[European Union]] (EU) to verify an individual's citizenship in a member-nation, and the kind of work which that individual may engage in. For example, citizens of states with provisional membership in the EU must obtain both an EU work card and a work card from nation in which they wish to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | publisher = Westmoreland Gazette | title = Employees Need a Work Card Permit | date = 2007-01-19 | url = http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/search/1134882.Employees_need_a_work_card_permit/ | accessdate = 2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where a union has won the [[closed shop]], a work card may be issued by a [[trade union]].  The work card will permit the non-union worker to work in the industry or for the employer with union permission.&lt;ref&gt;Lahane, "The Union Work Permit," ''Political Science Quarterly,'' September 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;
