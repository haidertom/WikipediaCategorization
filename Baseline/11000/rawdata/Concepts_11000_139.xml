'''(In)visible Dialogues''' was an art project realized at the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Stockholm]] in 2011. It was initiated by artist [[Per Huttner]] and biochemist [[Elias Arnér]]. The project was transgressing the boundaries of [[exhibition]], [[publication]] and [[lecture]]s in order to stimulate dialogues between art and science. The project was a sequel to the project [[Begrepp – En samling]] from 1992&lt;ref name="(In)visible Dialogues"&gt;''(In)visible Dialogues'', Ed. E. Arnér and P. Huttner, Published by Dent-de-Leone. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-3-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and drew on Hüttner's experiences from projects like [[I am a Curator]]&lt;ref name="Introdictionary"&gt;{{cite book

Languages: English, Swedish, Spanish and Rumanian. Design by Åbäke. Published by Vacio 9 and The Rumanian Cultural Institute. {{ISBN|978-91-633-0548-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

(In)Visible Dialogues was installed in three interconnected rooms. In the first, you saw 120 fluorescent chairs facing a blank wall. On the back of each chair a copy of the project's catalogue had been nailed and officially signed by a Professor from [[Karolinska Institutet]] and approved for publication, following local academic protocol. Each chair was an authorized copy of [[Jonas Bohlin]]'s Concrete from 1980 that had been customized by the design group Åbäke.&lt;ref name="(In)visible Dialogues" /&gt;

The two flanking side rooms remained empty apart from a solitary lectern painted in the same color as the chairs and which was connected to speakers that emitted music and sounds composed for the occasion by participating sound artists [[Andy Cox]] and Richard Allalouf, Natalia Kamia, Samon Takahashi, [[Ebbot Lundberg]] and Yan Jun who interpreted a text written by Hüttner and Arnér on the importance and difficulty of dialogues between art and science.&lt;ref name="(In)visible Dialogues" /&gt; A new sound piece was played back each week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.invisibledialogues.org/sounds.php |title=The sound pieces can be heard to on this website |access-date=2012-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726185523/http://www.invisibledialogues.org/sounds.php |archive-date=2011-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lundberg's contribution, ''There's Only One of Us Here'' was released in 2012 – his first solo album in a 25-year career.

At 2pm, every Sunday in March 2011, a dialogue took place. The dialogues were devised so that a member of the scientific community dialogued with a member of the world of visual art. The audience could not see the two dialoguing people, who could not see each other either.

The 14th Dalai Lama was born in [[Taktser]], [[Amdo]], [[Tibet]],  and was selected as the [[tulku]] of the [[13th Dalai Lama]] in 1937 and formally recognized as the 14th Dalai Lama at a public declaration near the town of Bumchen in 1939.&lt;ref name="dlce"&gt;{{cite web |title = Chronology of Events |url = http://www.dalailama.com/biography/chronology-of-events|website=The 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet |publisher = Office of the Dalai Lama |accessdate = 29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His enthronement ceremony as the Dalai Lama was held in Lhasa on 22 February 1940, and he eventually assumed full temporal (political) duties on 17 November 1950, at the age of 15, after [[Battle of Chamdo|the People's Republic of China's incorporation of Tibet]].&lt;ref name="dlce" /&gt; The Gelug school's government administered an area roughly corresponding to the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] just as the nascent PRC wished to assert control over it.

During the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], the Dalai Lama fled to [[India]], where he currently lives as a [[refugee]]. The 14th Dalai Lama received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1989. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' named him one of the "Children of Mahatma Gandhi" and his spiritual heir to [[nonviolence]].&lt;ref name="TimeTCOG"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993026,00.html|title=The Children of Gandhi|date=31 December 1999|work=Time|format=excerpt|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005013134/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C993026%2C00.html|archivedate=5 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has traveled the world and has spoken about the welfare of Tibetans, [[environmental quality|environment]], [[economics]], [[women's rights]], [[non-violence]], [[interfaith dialogue]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[Buddhism and science]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[reproductive health]], and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], along with various topics of [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist teachings.

London and New York: Yale University Press, 2011.' http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/13173/1/Hill_rv_2012_van_Schaik_review.pdf "Finally, the remark that '[[Yonten Gyatso]]  ... remains the only non-Tibetan to have held the role of Dalai Lama' (p. 177) presents a [[Monpa people|Monpa]] ([[sixth Dalai lama]]), and a Monguor (fourteenth Dalai Lama) as Tibetan although neither spoke Tibetan natively."&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of seven siblings to survive childhood. The eldest was his sister Tsering Dolma, eighteen years his senior. His eldest brother, [[Thupten Jigme Norbu]], had been recognised at the age of eight as the reincarnation of the high [[Lama]] [[Taktser Rinpoche]]. His sister, [[Jetsun Pema (activist)|Jetsun Pema]], spent most of her adult life on the [[Tibetan Children's Villages]] project. The Dalai Lama has said that his first language was "a broken [[Xining]] language which was (a [[varieties of Chinese|dialect of]]) the [[Chinese language]]", a form of [[Central Plains Mandarin]], and his family did not speak the [[Amdo Tibetan language|Tibetan language]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Laird, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NH5vuMA7LYcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=%22broken%20Chinese%20regional%20dialect%22&amp;f=false ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations With the Dalai Lama''], p. 262 (2007) "At that time in my village", he said, "we spoke a broken Chinese.

"So your first language", I responded, "was a broken Chinese regional dialect, which we might call Xining Chinese. It was not Tibetan. You learned Tibetan when you came to Lhasa." "Yes", he answered, "that is correct (  ... )."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ub8aAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=amdo++historic+homeland,+was+under+the+control+of+a+Muslim+warlord,+Ma+Bufang.+The+Dalai+Lama+and+his+family+didn't+learn+Tibetan+until+they+moved+to+Lhasa+in+1939&amp;dq=amdo++historic+homeland,+was+under+the+control+of+a+Muslim+warlord,+Ma+Bufang.+The+Dalai+Lama+and+his+family+didn't+learn+Tibetan+until+they+moved+to+Lhasa+in+1939&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=76ajTZ6RIMHngQes7MCkCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA |title = The economist, Volume 390, Issues 8618–8624 |year = 2009 |publisher = Economist Newspaper Ltd. |location= |page = 144 |ISBN = |accessdate = 9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/13184937 Politically incorrect tourism], ''The Economist'', 26 February 2009: "When the Dalai Lama was born, the region, regarded by Tibetans as part of Amdo, a province of their historic homeland, was under the control of a Muslim warlord, Ma Bufang. The Dalai Lama and his family didn't learn Tibetan until they moved to Lhasa in 1939."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dalai Lama boy.jpg|thumb|left|The Dalai Lama as a boy]]

Following reported signs and visions, three search teams were sent out to the north-east, the east, and the south-east to locate the new [[incarnation]] when the boy who was to become the 14th Dalai Lama was about two years old.&lt;ref name=bell397&gt;Bell 1946, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Basil Gould]], British delegate to Lhasa in 1936, related his account of the north-eastern team to Sir [[Charles Alfred Bell]], former British resident in Lhasa and friend of the 13th Dalai Lama. Amongst other omens, the head of the embalmed body of the [[thirteenth Dalai Lama]], at first facing south-east, had turned to face the north-east, indicating, it was interpreted, the direction in which his successor would be found. The [[Regent]], [[Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen|Reting Rinpoche]], shortly afterwards had a [[vision (religion)|vision]] at the sacred lake of [[Lhamo La-tso]] which he interpreted as Amdo being the region to search. This vision was also interpreted to refer to a large monastery with a gilded roof and turquoise tiles, and a twisting path from it to a hill to the east, opposite which stood a small house with distinctive eaves. The team, led by Kewtsang [[Rinpoche]], went first to meet the [[Thubten Choekyi Nyima, 9th Panchen Lama|Panchen Lama]], who had been stuck in [[Jyekundo]], in northern Kham.&lt;ref name=bell397 /&gt; The Panchen Lama had been investigating births of unusual children in the area ever since the death of the 13th Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="Laird 2006, p. 265"&gt;Laird 2006, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave Kewtsang the names of three boys whom he had discovered and identified as candidates. Within a year the Panchen Lama had died. Two of his three candidates were crossed off the list but the third, a "fearless" child, the most promising, was from Taktser village, which, as in the vision, was on a hill, at the end of a trail leading to Taktser from the great [[Kumbum Monastery]] with its gilded, turquoise roof. There they found a house, as interpreted from the vision—the house where Lhamo Dhondup lived.&lt;ref name=bell397 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laird 2006, p. 265" /&gt;

According to the 14th Dalai Lama, at the time the village of [[Taktser]] stood right on the "real border" between the region of [[Amdo]] and China.&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 262–263.&lt;/ref&gt; When the team visited, posing as pilgrims, its leader, a Sera Lama, pretended to be the servant and sat separately in the kitchen. He held an old [[Buddhist prayer beads|rosary]] that had belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama, and the boy Lhamo Dhondup, aged two, approached and asked for it. The monk said "if you know who I am, you can have it." The child said "Sera Lama, Sera Lama" and spoke with him in a Lhasa accent, in a dialect the boy's mother could not understand. The next time the party returned to the house, they revealed their real purpose and asked permission to subject the boy to certain tests. One test consisted of showing him various pairs of objects, one of which had belonged to the [[13th Dalai Lama]] and one which had not. In every case, he chose the Dalai Lama's own objects and rejected the others.&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 265–266.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it was the Panchen Lama who first discovered and identified the 14th Dalai Lama.

From 1936 the Hui '[[Ma Clique]]' Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]] ruled [[Qinghai]] as its governor under the nominal authority of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drGGEsi1fFEC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=ma+bufang+paintings&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3I_lTbDEK8LOgAfQ67nGBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20bufang%20paintings&amp;f=false|title=Beyond the Great Wall: urban form and transformation on the Chinese frontiers|author=Piper Rae Gaubatz|year=1996|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|location=|page=36|isbn=0-8047-2399-0|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview with the 14th Dalai Lama, in the 1930s, Ma Bufang had seized this north-east corner of Amdo in the name of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s weak government and incorporated it into the Chinese province of [[Qinghai]].&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Before going to Taktser, Kewtsang had gone to Ma Bufang to pay his respects.&lt;ref name="Laird 2006, p. 265" /&gt; When Ma Bufang heard a candidate had been found in Taktser, he had the family brought to him in Xining.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; He first demanded proof that the boy was the Dalai Lama, but the Lhasa government, though informed by Kewtsang that this was the one, told Kewtsang to say he had to go to Lhasa for further tests with other candidates. They knew that if he was declared to be the Dalai Lama, the Chinese government would insist on sending a large army escort with him, which would then stay in Lhasa and refuse to budge.&lt;ref name=bell398&gt;Bell 1946, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; Ma Bufang, together with Kumbum Monastery, then refused to allow him to depart unless he was declared to be the Dalai Lama, but withdrew this demand in return for 100,000 Chinese dollars ransom in silver to be shared amongst them, to let them go to Lhasa.&lt;ref name=bell398 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1984, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Kewtsang managed to raise this, but the family was only allowed to move from Xining to Kumbum when a further demand was made for another 330,000 dollars ransom: one hundred thousand each for government officials, the commander-in-chief, and the Kumbum Monastery; twenty thousand for the escort; and only ten thousand for Ma Bufang himself, he said.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 1946, pp. 398–399.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years of diplomatic wrangling followed before it was accepted by Lhasa that the ransom had to be paid to avoid the Chinese getting involved and escorting him to Lhasa with a large army.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1984, pp. 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the boy was kept at Kumbum where two of his brothers were already studying as monks and recognised incarnate lamas.&lt;ref name=laird267&gt;Laird 2006, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; The payment of 300,000 silver dollars was then advanced by Muslim traders en route to Mecca in a large caravan via Lhasa. They paid Ma Bufang on behalf of the Tibetan government against promissory notes to be redeemed, with interest, in Lhasa.&lt;ref name=laird267 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rich153&gt;Richardson 1984, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The 20,000-dollar fee for an escort was dropped, since the Muslim merchants invited them to join their caravan for protection; Ma Bufang sent 20 of his soldiers with them and was paid from both sides since the Chinese government granted him another 50,000 dollars for the expenses of the journey. Furthermore, the Indian government helped the Tibetans raise the ransom funds by affording them import concessions.&lt;ref name=rich153 /&gt;

Released from Kumbum, on 21 July 1939 the party travelled across Tibet in an epic journey to Lhasa in the large Muslim caravan with Lhamo Thondup, now 4 years old, riding with his brother Lobsang in a special palanquin carried by two mules, two years after being discovered. As soon as they were out of Ma Bufang's area, he was officially declared to be the 14th Dalai Lama by the Central Government of Tibet, and after ten weeks of travel he arrived in Lhasa on 8 October 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 268–269.&lt;/ref&gt; The ordination ([[pabbajja]]) and giving of the monastic name of Tenzin Gyatso were handled by [[Reting Rinpoche]]. There was very limited Chinese involvement at this time.&lt;ref name="Banyan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21646795-even-china-accepts-only-dalai-lama-can-legitimise-its-rule-tibet-golden-urn|title=The Golden Urn: Even China Accepts That Only the Dalai Lama Can Legitimise Its Rule in Tibet|last=Banyan|website=The Economist|date=19 March 2015|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] normally refer to him as Yishin Norbu (''Wish-Fulfilling Gem''), Kyabgon (''Saviour''), or just Kundun (''Presence''). His devotees, as well as much of the Western world, often call him ''His Holiness the Dalai Lama'', the [[style (manner of address)|style]] employed on the Dalai Lama's website.

[[File:Potala.jpg|thumb|Lhasa's [[Potala]] Palace, today a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]], pictured in 2006]]

Historically the Dalai Lamas or their [[regent]]s held political and religious leadership over [[Tibet]] from [[Lhasa]] with varying degrees of influence depending on the regions of Tibet and periods of history. This began with the [[5th Dalai Lama]]'s rule in 1642 and lasted until the 1950s (except for 1705–1750), during which period the Dalai Lamas headed the Tibetan government or [[Ganden Phodrang]]. Until 1912 however, when the [[13th Dalai Lama]] declared the complete independence of [[Tibet (1912–1951)|Tibet]], their rule was generally subject to [[priest and patron|patronage and protection]] of firstly Mongol kings (1642–1720) and then the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] (1720–1912).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Smith, Warren W. Jr.|title=Tibetan Nation: A History of Tibetan Nationalism and Sino-Tibetan Relations|date=1997|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New Delhi|isbn=0-8133-3155-2|pages=107–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, at the age of four, the present Dalai Lama was taken in a procession of lamas to Lhasa. The Dalai Lama's childhood was then spent between the [[Potala Palace]] and [[Norbulingka]], his summer residence, both of which are now [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage sites]].

China claims that the [[Kuomintang]] government ratified the 14th Dalai Lama and that a Kuomintang representative, General [[Wu Zhongxin]], presided over the ceremony. The British Representative [[Basil Gould|Sir Basil Gould]] was also at the ceremony and bore witness to the falsity of the Chinese claim to have presided over it. He criticised the Chinese account as follows: 
{{quote|The report was issued in the Chinese Press that Mr Wu had escorted the Dalai Lama to his throne and announced his installation, that the Dalai Lama had returned thanks, and prostrated himself in token of his gratitude. Every one of these Chinese claims was false. Mr Wu was merely a passive spectator. He did no more than present a ceremonial scarf, as was done by the others, including the British Representative. But the Chinese have the ear of the world, and can later refer to their press records and present an account of historical events that is wholly untrue. Tibet has no newspapers, either in English or Tibetan, and has therefore no means of exposing these falsehoods.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 1946, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tibetan scholar Nyima Gyaincain wrote that based on Tibetan tradition, there was no such thing as presiding over an event, but two things are clear, first, the word "主持 (preside or organize)" was used in many places in communication documents. The meaning of the word was different than what we understand today. Second, [[Wu Zhongxin]] spent a lot of time and energy on the event, his effect of presiding over or organizing the event was very obvious.&lt;ref name="王家伟尼玛坚赞1997_preside"&gt;{{cite book|author1=王家伟|author2=尼玛坚赞|title=中国西藏的历史地位|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWCa0NSILSsC&amp;pg=PA133|year=1997|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-80113-303-8|pages=133–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Goldstein:

In October 1950 the army of the [[People's Republic of China]] marched to the edge of the Dalai Lama's territory and sent a delegation after defeating a legion of the Tibetan army in [[warlord]]-controlled [[Kham]]. On 17 November 1950, at the age of 15, the 14th Dalai Lama was enthroned formally as the temporal ruler of Tibet.

=== Cooperation and conflicts with the People's Republic of China ===

Panchen Lama and Dalai Lama had many conflicts in Tibetan history. Dalai Lama's formal rule was brief. He sent a delegation to Beijing, which, without his authorization,&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; ratified the [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, Tenzin, Dalai Lama XIV, interview, 25 July 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Melvyn C., ''A History of Modern Tibet, 1913–1951'', University of California Press, 1989, pp. 812–813.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with the Chinese government: in September 1954, together with the [[10th Panchen Lama]] he went to the Chinese capital to meet [[Mao Zedong]] and attend the first session of the [[National People's Congress]] as a delegate, primarily discussing [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|China's constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, M.C., ''A History of Modern Tibet, Volume 2 – The Calm before the Storm: 1951–1955'', p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-08/30/content_3422747.htm Ngapoi recalls the founding of the TAR]'', [[Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme]], ''[[China View]]'', 30 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 September 1954, the Dalai Lama was selected as a [[Vice Chairperson of the National People's Congress|Vice chairman]] of the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]] of the [[National People's Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, M.C., ''A History of Modern Tibet, Volume 2 – The Calm before the Storm: 1951–1955'', p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voyage.typepad.com/china/2007/01/chairman_mao_lo.html |title=Chairman Mao: Long Live Dalai Lama! |publisher=Voyage.typepad.com |date=21 January 2007 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505143746/http://voyage.typepad.com/china/2007/01/chairman_mao_lo.html |archivedate=5 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a post he officially held until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90883/6284184.html |title = Official: Dalai Lama's U.S. award not to affect Tibet's stability |date = 2007-10-16 |accessdate = 28 August 2010 |publisher = [[People's Daily]]|work=[[17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, on a trip to India to celebrate the [[Buddha's Birthday]], the Dalai Lama asked the [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], if he would allow him [[political asylum]] should he choose to stay. Nehru discouraged this as a provocation against peace, and reminded him of the Indian Government's [[Non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] stance agreed upon with its [[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence|1954 treaty with China]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

=== Exile to India ===

After the founding of the government in exile he re-established the approximately 80,000 Tibetan refugees who followed him into exile in agricultural settlements.&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; He created a Tibetan educational system in order to teach the Tibetan children the [[Tibetic languages|language]], [[History of Tibet|history]], [[Tibetan Buddhism|religion]], and [[Tibet#Culture|culture]].

He supported the refounding of 200 monasteries and nunneries in an attempt to preserve Tibetan Buddhist teachings and the Tibetan way of life.

The Dalai Lama appealed to the [[United Nations]] on the rights of Tibetans. This appeal resulted in three resolutions adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] in 1959, 1961, and 1965,&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; all before the People's Republic [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|was allowed representation at the United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/ |title=Events of 1971 |work=Year in Review |year=1971 |publisher=United Press International |accessdate=28 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gYCuqxqS?url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/ |archivedate=5 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolutions called on China to respect the human rights of [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]].&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; In 1963, he promulgated a democratic constitution which is based upon the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], creating an elected [[Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration|parliament]] and an [[Central Tibetan Administration|administration]] to champion his cause.

At the [[Congressional Human Rights Caucus]] in 1987 in [[Washington, D.C.]], the Dalai Lama gave a speech outlining his ideas for the future status of Tibet. The plan called for Tibet to become a democratic "zone of peace" without [[nuclear weapons]], and with support for [[human rights]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The plan would come to be known as the "Strasbourg proposal", because the Dalai Lama expanded on the plan at [[Strasbourg]] on 15 June 1988. There, he proposed the creation of a self-governing Tibet "in association with the People's Republic of China." This would have been pursued by negotiations with the PRC government, but the plan was rejected by the Tibetan Government-in-Exile in 1991. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The Dalai Lama has indicated that he wishes to return to Tibet only if the People's Republic of China agrees not to make any precondition for his return.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/05/china.lukeharding Interview] with ''[[The Guardian]]'', 5 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the then-[[Paramount leader]] [[Deng Xiaoping]] set China's sole return requirement to the Dalai Lama as that he "must [come back] as a Chinese citizen  ... that is, patriotism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/01/content_10921943_3.htm |title = Origin of the title of "Dalai Lama" and its related background |date = 2009-03-01 |accessdate = 28 August 2010 |first=Jiang|last=Yuxia |publisher = [[Xinhua]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dalai Lama celebrated his seventieth birthday on 6 July 2005. About 10,000 Tibetan refugees, monks and foreign tourists gathered outside his home.

Giving [[public talks]] for non-Buddhist audiences and interviews and teaching Buddhism to large public audiences all over the world, as well as to private groups at his residence in India, appears to be the Dalai Lama's main activity.&lt;ref name="Schedule"&gt;{{cite web |title = Schedule |url = http://www.dalailama.com/teachings/schedule |publisher = Office of the Dalai Lama |accessdate = 19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite becoming 80 years old in 2015 he maintains a busy international lectures and teaching schedule.&lt;ref name="Schedule" /&gt; His [[public talks]] and [[teachings]] are usually [[webcast]] live in multiple languages, via an inviting organisation's [[website]], or on the Dalai Lama's own website. Scores of his past teaching videos can be viewed there, as well as [[public talks]], [[Convention (meeting)|conferences]], [[interviews]], [[dialogues]] and [[panel discussion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Browse webcasts – Teachings |url = http://dalailama.com/webcasts/category/1 |publisher = Office of the Dalai Lama |accessdate = 19 May 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131209033538/http://www.dalailama.com/webcasts/category/1 |archive-date = 9 December 2013 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dalai Lama's best known teaching subject is the [[Kalachakra tantra]] which, as of 2014, he had conferred a total of 33 times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Kshipra Simon |title=His Holiness Dalai Lama leading the 33rd Kalachakra World Peace Prayer in Ladakh. |url=http://www.demotix.com/news/5330591/33rd-kalachakra-ladakh#media-5330334 |publisher=Demotix |location=New Delhi, India |format=Photojournalism |date=21 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703140659/http://www.demotix.com/news/5330591/33rd-kalachakra-ladakh#media-5330334 |archivedate=3 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; most often in India's upper Himalayan regions but also in western venues like [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City|New York]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Washington DC]], [[Barcelona]], [[Graz]], [[Sydney]] and [[Toronto]].&lt;ref name="Office of Dalai Lama"&gt;{{cite web |title = Kalachakra Initiations by His Holiness the Dalai Lama |url = http://dalailama.com/teachings/kalachakra-initiations |publisher = Office of Dalai Lama |accessdate = 19 May 2015 |quote = List of}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kalachakra]] (Wheel of Time) is one of the most complex teachings of Buddhism, sometimes taking two weeks to confer, and he often confers it on very large audiences, up to 200,000 students and disciples at a time.&lt;ref name="Office of Dalai Lama" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Antonia Blumberg |title = Dalai Lama Delivers Kalachakra Buddhist Teaching To Thousands of Devotees |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/07/dalai-lama-kalachakra_n_5564616.html |publisher = Huffington Post |date = 7 July 2014 |quote = Roughly 150,000 devotees reportedly converged for the event}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dalai Lama's essay, "The Ethic of Compassion" (1999), he expresses his belief that if we only reserve compassion for those that we love, we are ignoring the responsibility of sharing these characteristics of respect and empathy with those we do not have relationships with, which cannot allow us to "cultivate love." He elaborates upon this idea by writing that although it takes time to develop a higher level of compassion, eventually we will recognize that the quality of empathy will become a part of life and promote our quality as humans and inner strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalai Lama XIV|title="The Ethic of Compassion."|date=1999|publisher=Riverhead Books|pages=123–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He frequently accepts requests from students to visit various countries worldwide in order to give teachings to large Buddhist audiences, teachings that are usually based on classical Buddhist texts and commentaries,&lt;ref name=DLSch&gt;{{cite web |title = Schedule |url = http://www.dalailama.com/teachings/schedule |publisher = Office of Dalai Lama |accessdate = 3 May 2015|location=World-wide}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most often those written by the 17 pandits or great masters of the [[Nalanda]] tradition, such as Nagarjuna,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=His Holiness the Dalai Lama in Brisbane |url=http://www.karuna.org.au/announcements/his-holiness-the-dalai-lama-in-brisbane |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110134531/http://www.karuna.org.au/announcements/his-holiness-the-dalai-lama-in-brisbane |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 January 2015 |date=5 January 2015 |quote=The Dalai Lama's Brisbane teaching will be based on the classic text, Nagarjuna's 'Precious Garland' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Donald S Lopez Jr. |title = Nagarjuna |url = http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/401601/Nagarjuna |publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica |date = 24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamalashila,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jamyang Dorjee Chakrishar |title=When Indian Pandit Kamalashila defeated China's Hashang in Tibet |url=http://www.sherpaworld.com/show.php?at=1&amp;sn=6805 |publisher=Sherpa World |accessdate=3 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521052014/http://www.sherpaworld.com/show.php?at=1&amp;sn=6805 |archivedate=21 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Dalai Lama teaching Kamalashila text in Australia, 2008 |url = http://www.dalailamainaustralia.org/pages/?PageID=210 |publisher = Dalai Lama in Australia |date = 11 June 2008 |quote = by reference to Kamalashila's text, His Holiness the Dalai Lama will demonstrate how the nature of awareness, developed through meditative practices can be transformed into the direct perceptual wisdom necessary to achieve enlightenment itself}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shantideva,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Compassion in Emptiness: Dalai Lama Teaches Shantideva |url = http://www.oscilloscope.net/films/film/51/Compassion-in-Emptiness |publisher = Oscilloscope |format = DVD set |date = 7 May 2011 |quote = In 2010, His Holiness traveled to New York City to teach A Commentary on Bodhicitta by Nagarjuna and A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life by Shantideva.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atisha,&lt;ref name="Atis"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Phuntsok Yangchen |title = Disciples from over 60 countries attend the Dalai Lama's teachings |url = http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=32210 |publisher = Phayul.com |date = 1 October 2012 |quote = The Dalai Lama today began his four-day teachings on Atisha's [text] 'Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayradeva&lt;ref name="Arya"&gt;{{cite web |title = The Dalai Lama's Boston teachings |url = http://www.shambhala.com/blog/shambhala/the-dalai-lamas-teaching-on-stages-of-meditation |publisher = Shambala Publications |date = 17 October 2012 |quote = Texts mentioned by His Holiness in his talk   ...

As examples of other teachings, in London in 1984 he was invited to give teachings on the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising, and on [[Dzogchen]], which he gave at Camden Town Hall; in 1988 he was in London once more to give a series of lectures on Tibetan Buddhism in general, called 'A Survey of the Paths of Tibetan Buddhism'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = A Survey of the Paths of Tibetan Buddhism |url = http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&amp;id=421 |publisher = Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive |accessdate = 18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again in London in 1996 he taught the [[Four Noble Truths]], the basis and foundation of Buddhism accepted by all Buddhists, at the combined invitation of 27 different Buddhist organisations of all schools and traditions belonging to the Network of Buddhist Organisations UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Tseten Samdup |title = His Holiness the Dalai Lama will visit the UK from July 15–22 1996 |url = http://www.tibet.ca/en/library/wtn/archive/old?y=1996&amp;m=7&amp;p=7_2 |publisher = World Tibet Network News |date = 7 July 1996 |quote = For the first time in the West, His Holiness the Dalai Lama will give two exclusive days of teaching on 17 and 18 July 1996 on the Four Noble Truths – the heart of the Buddha's teachings.

In India, the Dalai Lama gives religious teachings and talks in Dharamsala&lt;ref name="Atis" /&gt; and numerous other locations including the monasteries in the Tibetan refugee settlements,&lt;ref name="DLSch" /&gt; in response to specific requests from Tibetan monastic institutions, Indian academic, religious and business associations, groups of students and individual/private/lay devotees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Teachings |url = http://www.dalailama.com/teachings |publisher = Office of Dalai Lama |accessdate = 3 May 2015 |quote = His Holiness has also been giving teachings in India at the request of various Buddhist devotees from Taiwan and Korea}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, no fees are charged to attend these teachings since costs are covered by requesting sponsors.&lt;ref name="DLSch" /&gt; When he travels abroad to give teachings there is usually a ticket fee calculated by the inviting organization to cover the costs involved&lt;ref name="DLSch" /&gt; and any surplus is normally to be donated to recognised charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = ONLINE DONATION FACILITY IS AVAILABLE |url = http://www.dalailamainaustralia.org/schedule/detail.aspx?ArtistID=19 |publisher = Dalai Lama in Australia |accessdate = 3 May 2015 |quote = Should there be any surplus funds from His Holiness' events, that surplus will be disbursed to charitable organizations under the advisement of His Holiness the Dalai Lama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his frequent tours of India, Asia and the west he is also often invited to give, alongside his Buddhist teachings, public talks for non-Buddhist audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Michael Caddell |title = His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama to give public talk at Princeton University |url = https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S41/02/76E28/index.xml?section=topstories |publisher = Princeton University |date = 9 September 2014 |quote = The Dalai Lama will give a public talk, "Develop the Heart," at 9:30 a.m. at Jadwin Gymnasium.

=== Interfaith dialogue ===

The Dalai Lama met [[Pope Paul VI]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] in 1973. He met [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1980, 1982, 1986, 1988, 1990, and 2003. In 1990, he met a delegation of Jewish teachers in Dharamshala for an extensive interfaith dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Kamenetz, Rodger (1994)[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060645741 The Jew in the Lotus] Harper Collins: 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; He has since visited Israel three times, and in 2006 met the Chief Rabbi of Israel. In 2006, he met [[Pope Benedict XVI]] privately. He has met the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Dr. [[Robert Runcie]], and other leaders of the Anglican Church in London, [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], who at the time was the president of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), as well as senior [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Muslim]], [[Hindu]], [[Jewish]], and [[Sikh]] officials.

The Dalai Lama sees important common ground between [[science and Buddhism]] in having the same approach to challenge dogma on the basis of [[empirical evidence]] that comes from [[observation]] and [[analysis]] of [[phenomena]].&lt;ref name=MITTR&gt;{{cite web|author1=Curt Newton |title = Meditation and the Brain |url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/402450/meditation-and-the-brain/|website=technologyreview.com |publisher = MIT Technology Review |date = 1 February 2004 |quote = The Dalai Lama notes that both traditions encourage challenging dogma based on observation and analysis, and a willingness to revise views based on empirical evidence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His growing wish to develop meaningful scientific dialogue to explore the [[Buddhism and science]] interface led to invitations for him to attend relevant conferences on his visits to the west, including the [[Alpbach]] Symposia on Consciousness in 1983 where he met and had discussions with the late Chilean neuroscientist [[Francisco J.

Apart from time spent teaching Buddhism and fulfilling responsibilities to his Tibetan followers, the Dalai Lama has probably spent, and continues to spend, more of his time and resources investigating the interface between [[Buddhism and science]] through the ongoing series of [[Mind and Life Institute|Mind and Life]] dialogues and its spin-offs than on any other single activity.&lt;ref name=Grnd /&gt; As the Institute's Cofounder and the Honorary chairman he has personally presided over and participated in all its dialogues, which continue to expand worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Dialogues with the Dalai Lama |url = https://www.mindandlife.org/dialogues-dalai-lama/ |publisher = Mind and Life Institute |accessdate = 6 May 2015 |quote = These Dialogues will expand as Mind and Life grows to include Europe, Asia, and beyond}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the Mind and Life Education Humanities &amp; Social Sciences initiatives have been instrumental in developing the emerging field of Contemplative Science, by researching, for example, the effects of contemplative practice on the human brain, behaviour and biology.&lt;ref name="pdf" /&gt;

In his 2005 book ''The Universe in a Single Atom'' and elsewhere, and to mark his commitment to scientific truth and its ultimate ascendancy over religious belief, unusually for a major religious leader the Dalai Lama advises his Buddhist followers: "If scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lama|first1=Dalai |title = The Universe in a Single Atom |date = 2005 |publisher = Random House|location=New York |ISBN =978-0-375-72845-7 |page = 3|edition=First Large Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also cited examples of archaic Buddhist ideas he has abandoned himself on this basis.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=James Kingsland |title = Dalai Lama enlightens and enraptures contemplative scientists in Boston |url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/nov/03/dalai-lama-scientists-boston-international-symposium-contemplative-studies |publisher = The Guardian|location=Boston, USA |date = 3 November 2014 |quote = He   ... had long since abandoned Buddhist ideas about cosmology after reading about the findings of modern astronomers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These activities have even had an impact in the Chinese capital. In 2013 an 'academic dialogue' with a Chinese scientist, a Tibetan 'living Buddha' and a Professor of Religion took place in Beijing. Entitled "High-end dialogue: ancient Buddhism and modern science" it addressed the same considerations that interest the Dalai Lama, described as 'discussing about the similarities between Buddhism and modern science'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lethe Guo |title=High-end dialogue: ancient Buddhism and modern science |url=http://eng.tibet.cn/2010zj/zjhd/201312/t20131219_1960457.html |publisher=China Tibet Online |date=18 December 2013 |quote=crossover between Buddhism and science has become a hot topic in the academic and cultural circles over the recent decades |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005160313/http://eng.tibet.cn/2010zj/zjhd/201312/t20131219_1960457.html |archivedate=5 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vienna 2012-05-26 - Europe for Tibet Solidarity Rally 194 HH sequence s.jpg|thumb|Tenzin Gyatso in Vienna, Austria, in&amp;nbsp;2012]]

The Dalai Lama says that he is active in spreading India's message of [[nonviolence]] and religious harmony throughout the world. "I am the messenger of India's ancient thoughts the world over." He has said that democracy has deep roots in India. He says he considers India the master and Tibet its disciple, as great scholars went from India to Tibet to teach Buddhism. He has noted that millions of people lost their lives in violence and the economies of many countries were ruined due to conflicts in the 20th century.

In April 2013, the Dalai Lama openly criticised Buddhist monks' [[2013 Burma anti-Muslim riots|attacks on Muslims]] in [[Myanmar]] "Buddha always teaches us about forgiveness, tolerance, compassion. If from one corner of your mind, some emotion makes you want to hit, or want to kill, then please remember Buddha's faith. We are followers of Buddha."

In response to the death of [[China|Chinese]] [[2010 Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Liu Xiaobo]], who died of organ failure while in government custody, the Dalai Lama issued the following statement on 14 July 2017, "I am deeply saddened to learn that fellow Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo has passed away while undergoing a lengthy prison sentence  ... It is my belief that Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo's unceasing efforts in the cause of freedom will bear fruit before long."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.dalailama.com/news/2017/message-from-his-holiness-the-dalai-lama His Holiness the Dalai Lama Deeply Saddened by Liu Xiaobo's Passing…"].

=== Diet and animal welfare ===
{{quote|People think of animals as if they were vegetables, and that is not right. We have to change the way people think about animals.

The Dalai Lama advocates compassion for animals and frequently urges people to try [[vegetarianism]] or at least reduce their consumption of meat. In Tibet, where historically meat was the most common food, most monks historically have been [[omnivore]]s, including the Dalai Lamas. The Fourteenth Dalai Lama was raised in a meat-eating family but converted to vegetarianism after arriving in India, where vegetables are much more easily available. He spent many years as a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]], but after contracting [[hepatitis]] in India and suffering from weakness, his doctors ordered him to eat meat on alternating days, which he did for several years. He tried switching back to a vegetarian diet, but once again returned to limited consumption of meat. This attracted public attention when, during a visit to the White House, he was offered a vegetarian menu but declined by replying, as he is known to do on occasion when dining in the company of non-vegetarians, "I'm a Tibetan monk, not a vegetarian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iyer |first=Pico |title=The Open Road: The Global Journey of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama |publisher=Knopf Publishing Group |date=2008 |page=203 |url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=ExP5VoHTyzgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own home kitchen, however, is completely vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.shabkar.org/teachers/tibetanbuddhism/dalai_lama.htm |title = H.H.

He reports hearing of [[communism]] when he was very young, but only in the context of the destruction of [[Mongolian People's Republic|Communist Mongolia]].

{{quote|Of all the modern economic theories, the economic system of [[Marxism]] is founded on moral principles, while [[capitalism]] is concerned only with gain and profitability.

For those reasons the system appeals to me, and it seems fair. I just recently read an article in a paper where His Holiness the Pope also pointed out some positive aspects of Marxism.&lt;ref name="GuardMarx"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/jun/20/dalai-lama-marxist-buddhism Of course the Dalai Lama's a Marxist] by Ed Halliwell, ''The Guardian'', June 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TibetMarx" /&gt;}}

=== Environment ===

The Dalai Lama is outspoken in his concerns about [[environmental problem]]s, frequently giving public talks on themes related to the environment. He has pointed out that many rivers in Asia [[Geography of Tibet|originate in Tibet]], and that the [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|melting of Himalayan glaciers]] could affect the countries in which the rivers flow.&lt;ref name="global"&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.smh.com.au/environment/think-global-before-local-dalai-lama-20091130-k17b.html |title = Think global before local: Dalai Lama|first=Joyce|last=Morgan |date = 2009-12-01 |accessdate = 28 August 2010 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged official Chinese laws against [[deforestation]] in Tibet, but lamented they can be ignored due to possible [[Corruption in the People's Republic of China|corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Dalai_Lama_bemoans_deforestation_of_Tibet_999.html |title = Dalai Lama bemoans deforestation of Tibet|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date = 2007-11-21 |accessdate = 28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was quoted as saying "ecology should be part of our daily life";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://archive.org/details/DalaiLama_2006_09_19 |title = His Holiness the Dalai Lama's Address to the University at Buffalo |publisher = Archive.org |accessdate = 2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; personally, he takes showers instead of baths, and turns lights off when he leaves a room.&lt;ref name="global" /&gt; Around 2005, he started campaigning for [[wildlife conservation]], including by issuing a religious ruling against wearing tiger and leopard skins as garments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = Dalai Lama Campaigns to End Wildlife Trade |date = 8 April 2005 |publisher = ENS |url = http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/apr2005/2005-04-08-01.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = Reports Fur Flies Over Tiger Plight |author = Justin Huggler |work = New Zealand Herald |date = 18 February 2006 |url = http://www.tew.org/archived/wildlife.skins.issue.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013141142/http://tew.org/archived/wildlife.skins.issue.html |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 13 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama supports the [[anti-whaling]] position in the [[whaling controversy]], but has criticized the activities of groups such as the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] (which carries out acts of what it calls aggressive nonviolence against property).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jun2010/2010-06-23-02.html |title = Dalai Lama Reminds Anti-Whaling Activists to Be Non-Violent|location=[[Tokyo]] |date = 2010-06-23 |accessdate = 28 August 2010 |agency=[[Environment News Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], he urged national leaders to put aside domestic concerns and take collective action against [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5AT16B20091130 |title = Dalai Lama says climate change needs global action|location=Sydney |date = 2009-11-30 |accessdate = 28 August 2010 |agency=[[Reuters]]|first=Michael|last=Perry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexuality ===

A monk since childhood, the Dalai Lama has said that sex offers fleeting satisfaction and leads to trouble later, while chastity offers a better life and "more independence, more freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Dalai-Lama-Sex-spells-trouble-20081128 |title=Dalai Lama: Sex spells trouble |date=2008-11-28 |agency=[[News24.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has observed that problems arising from conjugal life sometimes even lead to suicide or murder.&lt;ref name=Teleg&gt;{{cite news |author = Published: 5:18&amp;nbsp;pm GMT 29 November 2008 |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/3534994/Sexual-intercourse-spells-trouble-says-Dalai-Lama.html |title = Sexual intercourse spells trouble, says Dalai Lama |publisher = Telegraph.co.uk |date = 29 November 2008 |accessdate = 2 May 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has asserted that all religions have the same view about adultery.&lt;ref name="foxsports1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://msn.foxsports.com/golf/story/The-Dalai-Lama-comments-on-Tiger-Woods%2527-scandal?GT1=39002 |title = The Dalai Lama comments on Tiger Woods' scandal |publisher = FOX Sports |date = 2010-02-20 |accessdate = 9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation not found}}

In his discussions of the traditional Buddhist view on appropriate sexual behavior, he explains the concept of "right organ in the right object at the right time," which historically has been interpreted as indicating that oral, manual and anal sex (both homosexual and heterosexual) are not appropriate in Buddhism or for Buddhists. However, he also says that in modern times all common, consensual sexual practices that do not cause harm to others are ethically acceptable and that society should accept and respect people who are [[gay]] or [[transgender]] from a secular point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_budd2.htm|title=Buddhism and homosexuality|website=www.religioustolerance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1994 interview with ''[[OUT Magazine]]'', the Dalai Lama clarified his personal opinion on the matter by saying, "If someone comes to me and asks whether [[homosexuality]] is okay or not, I will ask 'What is your companion's opinion?' If you both agree, then I think I would say, 'If two males or two females voluntarily agree to have mutual satisfaction without further implication of harming others, then it is okay.'"&lt;ref&gt;OUT Magazine February/March 1994&lt;/ref&gt; However, when interviewed by Canadian TV news anchor [[Evan Solomon]] on ''[[CBC News: Sunday]]'' about whether homosexuality is acceptable in Buddhism, the Dalai Lama responded that "it is sexual misconduct".&lt;ref&gt;The Huffington Post, 07/13/09, Gay Marriage: What Would Buddha Do?, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-shaheen/gay-marriage-what-would-b_b_230855.html&lt;/ref&gt; This was an echo of an earlier response in a 2004 ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'' interview when asked about homosexuality in Buddhism, where the Dalai Lama replied "for a Buddhist, the same sex, that is sexual misconduct".&lt;ref&gt;LifeSiteNews, 11/02/07/, The Dalai Lama, Like the Pope, Says Gay Sex is "Sexual Misconduct", http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/archive/ldn/2007/nov/07110208&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1996 book ''Beyond Dogma'', he described a traditional Buddhist definition of an appropriate sexual act as follows: "A sexual act is deemed proper when the couples use the organs intended for sexual intercourse and nothing else [  ... ] Homosexuality, whether it is between men or between women, is not improper in itself. What is improper is the use of organs already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact."&lt;ref&gt;Beyond Dogma by the Dalai Lama&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated in 1997, explaining that the basis of that teaching was unknown to him. He also conveyed his own "willingness to consider the possibility that some of the teachings may be specific to a particular cultural and historic context".&lt;ref&gt;"Dalai Lama Urges 'Respect, Compassion, and Full Human Rights for All', including Gays". Conkin, Dennis. ''Bay Area Reporter'', 19 June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dalai Lama has expressed concern at "reports of violence and discrimination against gay, [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] people" and "urges respect, tolerance and the full recognition of human rights for all".&lt;ref&gt;Press Release in WORLD, 24/04/2006, HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA ISSUES STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER PEOPLE, {{cite web|url=http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/782 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623030316/http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/782 |archivedate=23 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women's rights ===

In 2007, he said that the next Dalai Lama could possibly be a woman, remarking "If a woman reveals herself as more useful the lama could very well be reincarnated in this form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer |first=Richard |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1571850/Dalai-Lama-says-successor-could-be-a-woman.html |title = Dalai Lama says successor could be a woman |publisher = Telegraph.co.uk |date = 2007-12-07 |accessdate = 2010-11-19 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, on [[gender equality]] and sexism, the Dalai Lama proclaimed at the [[National Civil Rights Museum]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]: "I call myself a [[feminist]]. Isn't that what you call someone who fights for [[women's rights]]?" He also said that by nature, women are more compassionate "based on their biology and ability to nurture and birth children". He called on women to "lead and create a more compassionate world", citing the good works of nurses and mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tamara-conniff/the-dalai-lama-proclaims_b_297285.html |title = Tamara Conniff: The Dalai Lama Proclaims Himself a Feminist: Day Two of Peace and Music in Memphis |publisher = Huffington Post |date = 23 September 2009 |accessdate = 17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Dalai Lama attended the inauguration of the Secular Ethics for Higher Education Course at the [[Tata Institute of Social Sciences]] (TISS) in Mumbai, where he was reported to have stated that, "Since women have been shown to be more sensitive to others' suffering, their leadership may be more effective. His Holiness suggested it's time for men to withdraw and for women to step forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Secular Ethics for Higher Education |url=https://www.dalailama.com/news/2017/launch-of-tata-institute-of-social-sciences-course-in-secular-ethics-for-higher-education/amp |website=HIS HOLINESS The 14th DALAI LAMA of TIBET |publisher=THE OFFICE OF HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, he said in a BBC interview that if a female succeeded him, "that female must be attractive, otherwise it is not much use," and when asked if he was joking, replied, "No. True!" He followed with a joke about his current success being due to his own appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Dalai Lama Says If Successor Is Female, She Must Be Very Attractive |url = http://www.tricycle.com/blog/dalai-lama-says-if-successor-female-she-must-be-very-attractive |publisher = [[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]] |date = 22 September 2015 |accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health ===

In April 2013, at the Culture of Compassion event in Ebrington Square in [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]], the Dalai Lama asserted, stressing the importance of peace of mind: "Warm-heartedness is a key factor for healthy individuals, healthy families and healthy communities [  ... ] Scientists say that a healthy mind is a major factor for a healthy body. If you're serious about your health, think and take most concern for your peace of mind. That's very, very important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/18/dalai-lama-culture-of-com_n_3111216.html |title = Dalai Lama 'Culture of Compassion' Talk: Key To Good Health Is 'Peace Of Mind' (VIDEO) |work = Huffington Post |date = 2013-04-18 |accessdate = 17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration ===

In September 2018, speaking at a conference in Sweden's third-largest city, Malmo, home to a large immigrant population, the Dalai Lama said "I think Europe belongs to the Europeans," he said, adding they should make clear to refugees that "they ultimately should rebuild their own country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20180912-dalai-lama-says-europe-belongs-europeans|title=Dalai Lama says 'Europe belongs to Europeans'|date=12 September 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/dalai-lama-says-europe-belongs-to-europeans|title=Dalai Lama says 'Europe belongs to Europeans'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Speaking to German reporters the Dalai Lama said "too many" refugees are seeking asylum in Europe," adding that "Europe, for example Germany, cannot become an Arab country". He also said that Germany is Germany. "There are so many that in practice it becomes difficult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/05/31/the-dalai-lama-says-too-many-refugees-are-going-to-germany/|title=The Dalai Lama says 'too many' refugees are going to Germany|first=|last=https://www.facebook.com/max.bearak|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/migrant-crisis-dalai-lama-says-germany-cannot-become-an-arab-country-20160601-gp8mhr.html|title=Migrant crisis: Dalai Lama says Germany 'cannot become an Arab country'|first=Max|last=Bearak|date=31 May 2016|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retirement and succession plans ==

On 29 May 2011, the Dalai Lama retired from the [[Central Tibetan Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = His Holiness the Dalai Lama's Remarks on Retirement – March 19th, 2011 |url = http://dalailama.com/messages/retirement/retirement-remarks |accessdate = 14 September 2014 |date = 19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 2011, the Dalai Lama issued the following statement concerning his reincarnation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I am about ninety I will consult the high Lamas of the Tibetan Buddhist traditions, the Tibetan public, and other concerned people who follow Tibetan Buddhism, and re-evaluate whether the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue or not. On that basis we will take a decision. If it is decided that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama should continue and there is a need for the Fifteenth Dalai Lama to be recognized, responsibility for doing so will primarily rest on the concerned officers of the Dalai Lama's Gaden Phodrang Trust. They should consult the various heads of the Tibetan Buddhist traditions and the reliable oath-bound Dharma Protectors who are linked inseparably to the lineage of the Dalai Lamas. They should seek advice and direction from these concerned beings and carry out the procedures of search and recognition in accordance with past tradition. I shall leave clear written instructions about this. Bear in mind that, apart from the reincarnation recognized through such legitimate methods, no recognition or acceptance should be given to a candidate chosen for political ends by anyone, including those in the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/news/post/753-statement-of-his-holiness-the-fourteenth-dalai-lama-tenzin-gyatso-on-the-issue-of-his-reincarnation Statement of His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, on the Issue of His Reincarnation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204002812/http://www.dalailama.com/news/post/753-statement-of-his-holiness-the-fourteenth-dalai-lama-tenzin-gyatso-on-the-issue-of-his-reincarnation |date=4 February 2013 }} [http://www.dalailama.com/ Website of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet] 24 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 3 October 2011, the Dalai Lama repeated his statement in an interview with Canadian [[CTV News]]. He added that Chinese laws banning the selection of successors based on reincarnation will not impact his decisions. "Naturally my next life is entirely up to me. No one else. And also this is not a political matter," he said in the interview. The Dalai Lama also added that he was not decided on whether he would reincarnate or be the last Dalai Lama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = CTV |title = CTV Exclusive: Dalai Lama will choose successor |date = 3 October 2011 |url = http://www.ctvnews.ca/old-ctv-national-news/ctv-exclusive-dalai-lama-will-choose-successor-1.706189 |accessdate = 27 June 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101945/http://www.ctvnews.ca/old-ctv-national-news/ctv-exclusive-dalai-lama-will-choose-successor-1.706189 |archive-date = 6 October 2014 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the German newspaper ''Welt am Sonntag'' published on 7 September 2014 the Dalai Lama stated "the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose", and that "We had a Dalai Lama for almost five centuries. The 14th Dalai Lama now is very popular.

Gyatso has also expressed fear that the Chinese government would manipulate any reincarnation selection in order to choose a successor that would go along with their political goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/916409066|title=Religions in the modern world : traditions and transformations|others=Woodhead, Linda,, Partridge, Christopher H.

== Controversies ==

=== CIA Tibetan program ===
{{Main|CIA Tibetan program}}

In October 1998, the Dalai Lama's administration acknowledged that it received $1.7&amp;nbsp;million a year in the 1960s from the U.S. government through the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).&lt;ref name="tnyt 10-2-1998"&gt;{{cite news |title = World News Briefs; Dalai Lama Group Says It Got Money From C.I.A. |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F3061EF73E5C0C718CDDA90994D0494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fD%2fDalai%20Lama |date = 2 October 1998|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by CIA officer John Kenneth Knaus in 1995 to comment on the [[CIA Tibetan program]], the Dalai Lama replied that though it helped the morale of those resisting the Chinese, "thousands of lives were lost in the resistance" and further, that "the U.S. Government had involved itself in his country's affairs not to help Tibet but only as a Cold War tactic to challenge the Chinese."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = William Blum |url = http://members.aol.com/superogue/intro.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080321053809/http://members.aol.com/superogue/intro.htm |archivedate=21 March 2008 |title = Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower |publisher = Zed Books|year=2006 |accessdate = 2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography ''[[Freedom in Exile]]'', the Dalai Lama criticized the CIA again for supporting the [[Tibetan independence movement]] "not because they (the CIA) cared about Tibetan independence, but as part of their worldwide efforts to destabilize all [[communist]] [[Executive (government)|governments]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = CIA Gave Aid to Tibetan Exiles in '60s, Files Show |url = http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/15/news/mn-22993|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate = 8 September 2013 |quote = In his 1990 autobiography, 'Freedom in Exile', the Dalai Lama explained that his two brothers made contact with the CIA during a trip to India in 1956.

In 1999, the Dalai Lama said that the [[CIA Tibetan program]] had been harmful for Tibet because it was primarily aimed at serving American interests, and "once the [[Foreign policy of the United States|American policy]] toward China changed, they stopped their help."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jonathan Mirsky |title = Tibet: The CIA's Cancelled War |url = http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/apr/09/cias-cancelled-war-tibet/ |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |accessdate = 3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ties to India ===
[[File:Plaque at AP Museum, Amaravathi.jpg|250px|thumb|Stone Plaque at a plantation by Tenzin in Amaravathi]]
The [[Media of the People's Republic of China|Chinese press]] has criticized the Dalai Lama for his close ties with India. His 2010 remarks at the [[International Buddhist Conference]] in [[Gujarat]] saying that he was "Tibetan in appearance, but an Indian in spirituality" and referral to himself as a "son of India" in particular led the ''[[People's Daily]]'' to opine, "Since the Dalai Lama deems himself an Indian rather than Chinese, then why is he entitled to represent the voice of the Tibetan people?"&lt;ref name="heart"&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://chinatibet.people.com.cn/6876597.html |title = A look at the Dalai Lama's ridiculous Indian heart |date = 2010-01-22 |accessdate = 17 August 2010 |publisher = China Tibet Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhundup Gyalpo of the ''[[Tibet Sun]]'' shot back that Tibetan religion could be traced back to [[Nalanda]] in India, and that Tibetans have no connection to Chinese "apart  ... from a handful of culinary dishes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.tibetsun.com/opinions/2010/02/09/why-is-the-dalai-lama-son-of-india |title = Why is the Dalai Lama "son of India"? |first = Dhundup |last = Gyalpo |location = Dharamshala |date = 2010-02-09 |accessdate = 18 August 2010 |publisher = [[Tibet Sun]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717053610/http://www.tibetsun.com/opinions/2010/02/09/why-is-the-dalai-lama-son-of-india |archive-date = 17 July 2011 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''People's Daily'' stressed the links between [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and accused the Dalai Lama of "betraying [[South Tibet|southern Tibet]] to India".&lt;ref name="heart" /&gt; In 2008, the Dalai Lama said for the first time that the territory India claims as part of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is part of India, citing the disputed [[Simla Accord (1914)|1914 Simla Accord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Tawang is part of India: Dalai Lama |publisher = TNN |date = 4 June 2008 |url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Tawang_is_part_of_India_Dalai_Lama_/articleshow/3097568.cms |accessdate = 4 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shugden controversy ===
{{Main|Dorje Shugden controversy}}
The Dorje Shugden Controversy reappeared in the Gelug school by the publication of the ''Yellow Book'' in 1976, containing stories about wrathful acts of ''Dorje Shugden'' against Gelugpas who also practiced [[Nyingma]] teachings. In response, the 14th Dalai Lama, a Gelugpa himself and advocate of an "inclusive" approach to the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism,{{sfn|Mills|2003}}{{sfn|Kay|2004}} started to speak out against the practice of Dorje Shugden in 1978.{{sfn|Kay|2004|p=47}}

The controversy has attracted attention in the West because of demonstrations held in 2008 and 2014 by Dorje Shugden practitioners. A 2015 [[Reuters]] investigation determined "that the religious sect behind the protests has the backing of the Communist Party" and that the "group has emerged as an instrument in Beijing's long campaign to undermine support for the Dalai Lama".&lt;ref&gt;Lague, David.

Reuters found that the sect had become a key instrument in China's campaign to discredit the Tibetan spiritual leader."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gedhun Choekyi Nyima ===
In April 2018, the [[Dalai Lama]] confirmed the official Chinese claims about [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]] by saying that he knew from "reliable sources" that the Panchen Lama he had recognized was alive and receiving normal education. He said he hoped that the official Panchen Lama ([[Gyaincain Norbu]]) studied well under the guidance of a good teacher, adding that there were instances in Tibetan Buddhist tradition, of a reincarnated lama taking more than one manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestatesman.com/india/11th-panchen-lama-alive-receiving-education-dalai-lama-1502627372.html 11th Panchen Lama alive, receiving education: Dalai Lama], ''The Statesman'', April 25, 2018: "Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama on Wednesday said 11th Panchen Lama Gedhun Choekyi Nyima "according to reliable source is alive and receiving normal education".

"Then the Panchen Lama, which I recognised sometime back, there was no news, but then according to reliable information, he is still alive and receiving normal education. So we will see," he said.

In a May 2013 [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris]] Poll of 7,245 adults across the five largest European countries and the United States, the Dalai Lama was tied with President Barack Obama with the highest levels of popularity, 78%, of all world leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Regina A.

The Dalai Lama's appeal is variously ascribed to his charismatic personality, international fascination with Buddhism, his [[universalist]] values, international sympathy for the Tibetans, and western [[sinophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/dec/15/china-dalai-lama-exile-tibetans |title = The Next Dalai Lama: China has a choice|first=Dibyesh|last=Anand |publisher = The Guardian |date = 2010-12-15 |accessdate = 19 December 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, many films were released by the [[Cinema of the United States|American film industry]] about Tibet, including [[biopics]] of the Dalai Lama. This is attributed to both the Dalai Lama's 1989 Nobel Peace Prize as well as to the euphoria following the [[Fall of Communism]]. The most notable films, ''[[Kundun]]'' and ''[[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)|Seven Years in Tibet]]'' (both released in 1997), portrayed "an idyllic pre-1950 Tibet, with a smiling, soft-spoken Dalai Lama at the helm – a Dalai Lama sworn to [[non-violence]]": portrayals the Chinese government decried as [[ahistorical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Tibet |first=Michael |last=Buckley |publisher = [[Bradt Travel Guides]] |year=2006 |edition=2 |ISBN = 978-1-84162-164-7 |page = 35 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VrMcNDdB5-MC&amp;pg=PA35 |accessdate = 5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andreas Heusser''' (born 1976) is a [[Swiss]] [[conceptual art]]ist and [[curator]], based in [[Zurich]] and [[Johannesburg]].

== Artistic approach ==
Andreas Heusser's artistic approach can be described as creating long-term fictional realities made from contemporary real-world patterns. The works react upon and interact with a specific [[cultural]] or [[political]] situation while being created within that context, with that particular [[audience]], and within the social space of [[everyday life]]. Andreas Heusser uses various media and skills in order to accomplish the aimed – often political – effects.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Philip Preding online&lt;/ref&gt; The works can be enacted at any site – in [[Art museum|galleries]] and [[museums]], on the internet, on the street, or even in remote areas.

== Exploration of Nothing ==
Since 2013, Andreas Heusser has devoted himself to the [[exploration]] of [[nothing]] in [[art]], [[philosophy]] and [[science]]. This has developed into the [[No Show Museum]], a museum dedicated to [[nothing]] and its various [[wikt:manifestations|manifestations]] throughout the [[history of art]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.noshowmuseum.com/ No Show Museum]", www.noshowmuseum.com&lt;/ref&gt; The museum's collection includes around 500 works and documents from over 150 international artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. The museum also has a mobile presentation space in a converted postal car.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/bellevue/Das-Nichts-ist-unser-aller-Horizont/story/25033531 Das Nichts ist unser aller Horizont]". Tages-Anzeiger (2015-05-27)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the [[No Show Museum]] started a world tour with the mission to spread nothing: The first stage led from July to October 2015 through Europe, staging around 30 exhibitions in 20 different countries, before the museum was arriving in Italy and participating at the 56th [[Biennale di Venezia|Venice Art Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Juri; Zweifel, Stefan. "[https://biennials.ch/home/EventDetail.aspx?EventId=73 Pro Helvetia's platform to present the Swiss contributions to the Venice Biennials]". www.biennials.ch&lt;/ref&gt;
In the summer of 2016, the mobile museum was shipped from Europe to America: The 80-day exhibition tour led from New York to Canada, then to the West Coast of the U.S., and finally down to Baja California Sur, Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Yale University Radio WYBCX: [http://museumofnonvisibleart.com/interviews/andreas-heusser/ The Art World Demystified]. Hosted by Brainard Carey&lt;/ref&gt; The third stage of the world tour took place from November 2017 to January 2018 and led from Mexico through the countries of Central America to Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrix Dargel: [http://www.deutsches-museum.de/fileadmin/Content/010_DM/060_Verlag/060_KuT/2018/KT1-2018/Dargel.pdf Nichts zu sehen!] In: Kultur &amp; Technik. Deutsches Museum (Hsg.). Edition 1/2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum reproduces the typical [[structures]], mechanisms, [[rituals]] and [[strategies]] of established art institutions. As a result, the project becomes a model in which we can observe the contextual conditions that are required for the recognition of something (or nothing) as art. Implicit in the project, then, is the question: What is needed for a successful promotion and [[marketing]] of art?&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rts.ch/audio/la-1ere/programmes/forum/6397057-le-no-show-museum-le-musee-qui-n-a-rien-a-montrer-26-12-2014.html La musée qui n'a rien à montrer]". RTS.ch (2014-12-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art Activism Projects ==
Between 2009 and 2011, Andreas Heusser produced a series of large scale [[projects]] that bridge the gap between art and [[activism]].  Designed to reach not only the art scene, but to achieve a political effect on the general public, those projects often took place outside of art institutions, and involved public [[interventions]], [[websites]], [[social media]], [[press releases]], and other forms of dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.kampagnenpraxis.de/reports/provokation-verbreitet-sich-im-internet/ Provokation verbreitet sich im Internet]". www.kampagnenpraxis.de.&lt;/ref&gt; Using methods like parody, satire, interventions, and tactical obfuscation, he created fake organizations and [[corporations]] (including [[counterfeiting]] sites, media [[hoaxes]] and artificial characters) through imitating real corporations and [[political]] organizations. Tactics like [[subversive affirmation]] and overidentification were used to create controversy and generate media coverage in dominant media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au8ZznxNU-A ARD-Tagesthemen über OLAF]", ARD (2011-08-15).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the [[satiric]] content, those fake identities were often mistaken for the real thing and their critiques were not readily intelligible to audiences.
For example, in cooperation with Nüssli / Oeschger, he launched a counter-[[propaganda]] in order to subvert a [[xenophobic]] campaign of the [[swiss]] right wing party (SVP) by creating a twin-organization that was even more extreme in its claims – to a degree that it became [[ridiculous]] (OLAF, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xWwpT2KVdw Sammeltag für Ausländer, Bundesplatz Bern]". olafschweiz (2010-11-26).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the media coverage in the Swiss and international press was considerable, it did not put the [[Swiss]] electorate off from accepting the [[deportation]] [[initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.srf.ch/play/tv/kulturplatz/video/beissende-ironie?id=2af61856-f504-4691-b77d-9e8bc3bf9430 Beissende Ironie: Wie Satiriker auf populistische Kampagnen reagieren]". SF 1 (2010-12-01)&lt;/ref&gt;
Another example is the CHASOS Campaign, launched in 2011 as a [[satirical]] reaction on how media and politicians portrayed negative images and reinforces [[prejudices]] and fears by evoking the [[dystopia]] of gigantic waves of [[refugees]] which are alleged to flood Switzerland after the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXqERgOINk8 ARD Tagesthemen vom 15 June 2011 über CHASOS]" ARD (2011-08-15)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5591">'''Angelic tongues''' are the languages supposedly used by angels. It usually refers to sung praise in [[Second Temple period]] Jewish materials.

==Dead Sea Scrolls==
[[Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice]] is the principal source for angelic tongues at [[Qumran]]. The texts are fragmentary but appear to relate to praise tongues:
*[...] through the wonderful height [...] tongue of purity [...] gods (~yhla), seven [...] 4Q400 3 1, 1-2
* ...Psalm of praise, on the tongue of the fou[rth]...[Ps]alm of [tha]nksgiving, on the tongue of the fifth...[Psalm] of exultation, on the tongue of the sixth...Psalm of [singing, on the to]ngue of the seventh of the [chief] pri[nces,] a powerful song [to the God] of ho[lines] with its se[ven] wo[nd]er[ful songs] 4Q403 1 1, 1-6
* Proclaim his glory with the tongue of all who proclaim knowledge, his wonderful songs with the mouth of all who proclaim [him. For he is] God of all who sing {knowledge} for ever, and Judge in his power over all the spirits of understanding. 4Q4031 1 36-37
* ...The tongue of the first will be strengthened seven times with the tongue of the second to him....{this is repeated for the series up to the seventh}... 4Q403 1 2, 27-30

It is not clear whether the angelic tongues are coherent, intelligible to man. However, since Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice is itself related to sung praise at the Qumran community, there is a parallel with coherent angelic praise tongues in Testament of Job.&lt;ref&gt;Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, edited by James H. Charlesworth and Carol A. Newsom. Theological Studies 54  2003 649–653.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John C. Poirier ''Tongues of Angels: Concept of Angelic Languages in Classical Jewish and Christian Texts '' 2010. XI, 224 pages. WUNT II 287  p110 "Cf. Sheres and Blau 1995:84: "But the angels' speech [in the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice] is not recorded. Why do we not hear what they are saying? One commentator has suggested that the big difference between the 'tongues of men and of angels' rendered their idiom unintelligible. Perhaps also, at such auspicious moments the sectarians themselves spoke in tongues (an ecstatic incomprehensible language), a chanting that would drown out what was going on. The sectarians' taste for the esoteric is evident elsewhere"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George J. Brooke, Hindy Najman, Loren T. Stuckenbruck ''The significance of Sinai: traditions about Sinai and divine Revelation in Judaism and Christianity.'' 2008 p57 "Participation in the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice liturgy is reserved for those sufficiently righteous and ... in order to acquire “tongues of angels” would seem to have been such an elite."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loren T. Stückenbruck ''Angel veneration and Christology: a study in early Judaism and in the Christology of the Apocalypse of John, by Loren T. Stuckenbruck. WUNT 2/70'' 1995 p156 ''The Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice This brings us to a consideration of the angelic sabbath-liturgy (Shi- rot 'Olat ha-Shabbat), which was not fully published and ... and seven tongues, each being seven-fold more powerful than the next ...''&lt;/ref&gt;

The pseudepigraphical [[Testament of Job]] (ca.100 BCE–100CE) contains a conclusion which is believed to relate to the compiling of the hymnbook used by a [[Therapeutae]] community.&lt;ref&gt;''Testament of Job'' in Charlesworth J.H., The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha Vol.II, Doubleday 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Job gives one of his daughters "a cord" (a stringed instrument of some kind?) 
* "And she took on another heart—no longer minded toward earthly things—but ecstatically in the angelic dialect, sending up a hymn to God in accord with the style of the angels. And as she spoke ecstatically, she allowed “The Spirit” to be on her garment." (T. Job 48:2-3)&lt;ref&gt;http://wesley.nnu.edu/biblical_studies/noncanon/ot/pseudo/test-job.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Job’s other daughters likewise took on “the dialect of archons”, “the dialect of those and the “dialect of the cherubim” (T. Job 49:1-50:3). The “cherubim” are also mentioned Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice as blessing God (4Q403 1 2, 15, cf. 4Q405 20 2, 3). 

There is parallel description of sung prophecy among the Therapeutae in [[Alexandria]] by [[Philo]], but no mention there of angelic tongues.&lt;ref&gt;Philo, On the Contemplative Life http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book34.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
A possible reference to Jewish practices of angelic tongues is 1Co13:1 "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal." The distinction "of men" and "of angels" may suggests that a distinction was known to the Corinthians. If a distinction is intended then 1Co14:10 "There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning" may imply that "tongues of men" were intelligible, whereas 1Co14:2 For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit." refers to angelic tongues. The problem with this is that the "angelic" tongues documented at Qumran and among the Therapeutae appear to be inspired, but coherent and intelligible, sung praise. Against this is the view of Dunn that "It is evident then that Paul thinks of [[glossolalia]] as language". {{dubious|date=December 2015}} &lt;ref&gt;James D. G. Dunn Jesus and the Spirit: "A Study of the Religious and Charismatic Experience of Jesus and the First Christians as Reflected in the New Testament," p. 244 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''magma object''', can be defined in any category &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; equipped with a distinguished bifunctor &lt;math&gt;\otimes : \mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{C} \rightarrow \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Since '''Mag,''' the [[magma category|category of magmas]], has [[Direct product#Categorical product|cartesian product]]s, ergo we can consider magma objects in the category '''Mag'''. These are called auto magma objects. There's a more direct definition: an auto magma object is a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; together with a pair of 2-place operations &lt;math&gt;f,g:X\times X \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;g(f(x,y),f(x',y')) = f(g(x,x'),g(y,y'))&lt;/math&gt;.  A medial magma is the special case where these operations are equal.

The '''Bergvall system''' was a variation of the traditional [[knockout tournament]] system which was used at the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912]], [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]] and [[1924 Summer Olympics]]. 

It was devised for the Olympics by [[Erik Bergvall]], a Swedish [[water polo]] player, journalist and sports official. However, a similar system had been in use for sports competitions in the United States as early as 1884. 

Bergvall wanted to improve on the traditional knockout method used in Olympic competitions: believing that this was only fair in deciding the gold medal winner, Bergvall advocated separate competitions should also be held for the silver and bronze medals. 

Bergvall also believed that teams knocked out in the early rounds of the main gold medal tournament should be given a second chance, and that all the teams knocked out by the gold medal winner, including the losing finalist, should then compete in another knockout competition for the silver medal, before all the teams that were knocked out by the gold and silver medallists compete in a third competition for the bronze.  

At the 1912, 1920 and 1924 Games, the Bergvall system was used to decide the [[water polo at the Summer Olympics|water polo]], while at the [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Games]] it was also used for the [[football at the 1920 Summer Olympics|football]], the [[ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|ice hockey]] and the [[tug of war at the 1920 Summer Olympics|tug of war]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv8n1/johv8n1o.pdf   www.la84foundation.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the system is fair, there are two main flaws:
* It requires the gold medal final to be held in the middle of the tournament instead of at the end.
* It requires defeated competitors to remain ready to compete, otherwise those who lost to them will lose any chance of a medal.

Because of these flaws, the system was dropped by Olympic organisers after 1924 and was abandoned by the [[NCAA]] in the 1930s.

The '''Civil Rights Commission''' ({{lang-es|Comisión de Derechos Civiles}}) is an official entity within the [[legislative branch of the government of Puerto Rico]] charged with investigating violations of citizens' [[civil rights]]. The commission is empowered to educate citizens about their civil rights, investigate alleged civil rights violations, and carry out studies and investigations. Amendments to its organic law also empowers it to appear as a "[[amicus curiae|friend of the court]]" in cases that the commission deems to have an important effect on civil rights in Puerto Rico.

==Overview==
{{update|section|date=December 2015}}
The commission was created in 1965 under governor [[Roberto Sánchez Vilella]] as an independent agency under the [[Department of Justice (Puerto Rico)|Department of Justice]]. But it was not until 1996 that the commission was made part of the legislative branch, due, in part, to the efforts of governor [[Pedro Rosselló]].

Structurally, the entity is composed of five members that are appointed to a six-years term by the [[governor of Puerto Rico]], subject to the [[advice and consent]] of the [[Senate of Puerto Rico|Senate]]. Its current members include its chair, Georgina Candal Segurola, Esther Vicente Rivera, Rosemary Borges Capó, Ruth Miriam Perez Maldonado and [[Hiram Meléndez Juarbe|Hiram A. Meléndez Juarbe]].&lt;ref name="fortaleza1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortaleza.pr.gov/content/gobernador-hace-nombramientos-la-comisi-n-de-derechos-civiles |title=Gobernador hace nombramientos a la Comisión de Derechos Civiles &amp;#124; La Fortaleza |language=es |website=Fortaleza.pr.gov |date=2014-06-26 |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fortaleza1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.uprrp.edu/?p=5027 |title=Nombran catedrático de la Escuela de Derecho UPR a la Comisión de Derechos Civiles |website=Uprrp.edu |date=2015-08-18 |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other individuals that have served in the commission include former Sen. [[Luis Muñoz Rivera (senator)|Luis Muñoz Rivera]], newspaper publisher [[Antonio Luis Ferré]], former [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico|Resident Commissioner]] [[Baltasar Corrada del Río]], and the late Efraín González Tejera.

In spite of complaints that the commission is chronically underfunded, the entity has had a significant influence in Puerto Rican government operations.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The commission also annually selects the recipients of the [[Thurgood Marshall]] Award, which recognizes the commitment to civil rights of one law student from each of Puerto Rico's three law schools.

{{neuropsychology}}
'''Cognitive neuropsychology''' is a branch of [[cognitive psychology]] that aims to understand how the structure and function of the [[brain]] relates to specific [[psychological]] processes. Cognitive psychology is the science that looks at how mental processes are responsible for our cognitive abilities to store and produce new memories, produce language, recognize people and objects, as well as our ability to reason and problem solve. Cognitive neuropsychology places a particular emphasis on studying the [[cognitive]] effects of [[acquired brain injury|brain injury]] or [[neurological illness]] with a view to inferring models of normal [[cognitive]] functioning. Evidence is based on case studies of individual brain damaged patients who show deficits in brain areas and from patients who exhibit [[double dissociation]]s. Double dissociations involve two patients and two tasks. One patient is impaired at one task but normal on the other, while the other patient is normal on the first task and impaired on the other. For example, patient A would be poor at reading printed words while still being normal at understanding spoken words, while the patient B would be normal at understanding written words and be poor at understanding spoken words. Scientists can interpret this information to explain how there is a single cognitive module for word comprehension. From studies like these, researchers infer that different areas of the brain are highly specialised. Cognitive neuropsychology can be distinguished from [[cognitive neuroscience]], which is also interested in brain damaged patients, but is particularly focused on uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive processes.&lt;ref name="Schater 2000"&gt;{{cite book |quote=The term cognitive neuropsychology often connotes a purely functional approach to patients with cognitive deficits that does not make use of, or encourage interest in, evidence and ideas about brain systems and processes |first=Daniel L. |last1=Schacter |chapter=Understanding Implicit memory: A cognitive neuroscience approach |editor-first=M.S. |editor-last=Gazzaniga |title=Cognitive Neuroscience: A Reader |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99q2QgAACAAJ |year=2000 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-631-21659-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Phineas gage - 1868 skull diagram.jpg|right|200px|thumb|"''Front and lateral view of the cranium, representing the direction in which the iron traversed its cavity...''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harlow |first=John Martyn |year=1868 |title=Recovery from the Passage of an Iron Bar through the Head |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:Recovery_from_the_passage_of_an_iron_bar_through_the_head.djvu}} Originally published in {{cite journal |work=Publications of the Massachusetts Medical Society |volume=2 |pages=327–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Cognitive neuropsychology has its roots in the diagram making approach to [[language disorders|language disorder]] that started in the second half of the 19th century. The discovery that [[aphasia]] took different forms depending on the location of brain damage provided a powerful framework for understanding brain function.&lt;ref name="Coltheart, M. 2008"&gt;Coltheart, M. (2008). Cognitive neuropsychology. Scholarpedia, 3(2), 3644. doi: 10.4249/scholarpedia.3644&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861 [[Paul Broca]], reported a [[post-mortem examination|post mortem]] study of an [[aphasia|aphasic]] patient who was speechless apart from a single nonsense word:  "Tan". Broca showed that an area of the left [[frontal lobe]] was damaged. As Tan was unable to produce speech but could still understand it, Broca argued that this area might be specialised for speech production and that [[language]] skills might be localized to this [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] area. Broca did a similar study on another patient, Lelong, a few weeks later. Lelong, like Tan, could understand speech but could only repeat the same 5 words. After examining his brain, Broca noticed that Lelong had a lesion in approximately the same area as his patient Tan. He also noticed that in the more than 25 patients he examined with [[aphasia]], they all had lesions to the left frontal lobe but there was no damage to the right hemisphere of the brain. From this he concluded that the function of speech was probably localized in the inferior frontal gyrus of the left hemisphere of the brain, an area now known as [[Broca's area]].

[[Karl Wernicke]] subsequently reported patients with damage further back in the temporal lobe who could speak but were unable to understand what was said to them, providing evidence for two potentially interconnected language centres. These clinical descriptions were integrated into a theory of language organisation by [[Ludwig Lichtheim|Lichtheim]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Neil R. (2013). Physiology of Behavior. NJ, U.S: Pearson Education, Inc., p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, these models were used and developed to inform [[Joseph Jules Dejerine|Dejerine's]] account of reading, [[Liepmann]]'s theory of action and [[Lissauer]]'s 1890 account of object recognition  and [[Lewandowsky]] and Stadelmann's 1908 account of calculation.
[[Image:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumb|left|200px|Broca's area and Wernicke's area.]]
However, the early 20th century saw a reaction to the overly-precise accounts of the diagram making neurologists. [[Pierre Marie]] challenged  conclusions against previous evidence of Broca's areas in 1906 and [[Henry Head]] attacked the whole field of cerebral localisation 1926.

The modern science of cognitive neuropsychology emerged during the 1960s stimulated by the insights of the neurologist [[Norman Geschwind]] who demonstrated that the insights of Broca and Wernicke were still clinically relevant. The other stimulus to the discipline was the "Cognitive Revolution" and the growing science of [[cognitive psychology]] which had emerged as a reaction to [[behaviorism]] in the mid 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. A. (2003). The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7(3), 141-144. doi: 10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00029-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
Psychologists in the mid-1950s acknowledged that the structure of mental information-processing systems could be investigated in scientifically acceptable ways. They developed and applied new cognitive processing models to explain experimental data from not only studies of speech and language but also those of selective attention.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Coltheart, M. (2008). Cognitive neuropsychology. Scholarpedia, 3(2), 3644. doi: 10.4249/scholarpedia.3644.&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive psychologists and clinical neuropsychologists developed more research collaborations to gain a better understanding of these disorders. The rebirth of neuropsychology was marked by the publishing of two seminal collaborative papers from Marshall &amp; Newcombe (1966) on reading and Warrington &amp; Shallice (1969) on memory.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Subsequently, work by pioneers such as [[Elizabeth Warrington]], [[Brenda Milner]], [[Tim Shallice]], [[Alan Baddeley]] and [[Lawrence Weiskrantz]] demonstrated that neurological patients were an important source of data for cognitive psychologists.

It took less than one decade for neuropsychology to be fully re-established. More achievements in neuropsychology were recognized: the establishment of the first major book discussing neuropsychology using a cognitive approach, ''Deep Dyslexia'', in 1980 after a scientific meeting about the topic in Oxford in 1977, the birth of the ''Cognitive Neuropsychology'' journal in 1984, and the publishing of the first textbook of neuropsychology, ''Human Cognitive Neuropsychology'' in 1988.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A particular area of interest  was memory. Patients with [[amnesia]] caused by injuries to the [[hippocampus]]  in the temporal cortex and midbrain areas (especially the [[mamillary bodies]] were of early interest. A patient with severe case of amnesia will not be able to remember meeting the examiner if they leave the room and return, let alone events of the previous day ([[episodic memory]]), but they will still be able to learn how to tie their shoes ([[procedural memory]]), remember a series of numbers for a few seconds ([[short term memory]] or [[working memory]]) and be able to recall historical events they have learned in school ([[semantic memory]]). By contrast, patients may lose their short term memory abilities while retaining their long term memory functions.  Many other studies like this have been done in the field of neuropsychology examining lesions and the effect they have on certain areas of the brain and their functions.

[[Image:Hippolobes.gif|left|thumb|300px|Most of Molaison's hippocampus was removed bilaterally.]]
Studies on the amnesic patient [[Henry Molaison]], formerly known as patient H.M., are commonly cited as some of the precursors, if not the beginning of modern cognitive neuropsychology. Molaison had parts of his medial temporal lobes surgically removed to treat intractable [[epilepsy]] in 1953. Much of the hippocampus was also removed along with the medial temporal lobes. The treatment proved successful in reducing his dangerous [[seizure]]s, but left him with a profound but selective amnesia. After the surgery, Molaison was able to remember some big events from before the surgery, such as the stock market crash in 1929, but was confused about many others and could no longer form new memories. This accidental experiment showed scientists how the brain processes different types of memory. Because Molaison's impairment was caused by surgery, the damaged parts of his brain were known, information which was usually not knowable in a time before accurate [[neuroimaging]] became widespread. Scientists concluded that while the hippocampus is needed in the creation of new memories, it is not needed in the retrieval of old ones; they are two separate processes. They also realized that the hippocampus and the medial temporal lobes, both of the areas removed from Molaison, are the areas responsible for converting short term memory to long term memory.

Much of the early work of cognitive neuropsychology was carried out with limited reference to the detailed localisation of brain pathology. [[Neuroimaging]] was relatively imprecise and other anatomically based techniques were also limited. The emphasis of many researchers as late as 1990 was on the analysis of patterns of cognitive deficit rather than on where the injury was located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shallice|first1=Tim|title=From Neuropsychology to Mental Structure|date=October 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511526817}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of detailed anatomical data, studies of reading, language and memory had a number of important implications. The first is that certain [[cognitive]] processes (such as language) could be damaged separately from others, and so might be handled by distinct and independent cognitive (and neural) processes. (For more on the cognitive neuropsychological approach to language, see [[Eleanor Saffran]], among others.) The second is that such processes might be localized to specific areas of the brain. Whilst both of these claims are still controversial to some degree, the influence led to a focus on brain injury as a potentially fruitful way of understanding the relationship between [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]].

==Methods==
A key approach within cognitive neuropsychology has been to use single case studies and [[Dissociation (neuropsychology)|dissociation]] as a means of testing theories of cognitive function. For example, if a theory states that reading and writing are simply different skills stemming from a single cognitive process, it should not be possible to find a person who, after brain injury, can write but not read or read but not write. This selective breakdown in skills suggests that different parts of the brain are specialized for the different processes and so the cognitive systems are separable.

The philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]] has been particularly influential in cognitive neuropsychology, particularly with the idea that the mind, or at least certain parts of it, may be organised into independent modules. Evidence that cognitive skills may be damaged independently seem to support this theory to some degree, although it is clear that some aspects of mind (such as [[belief]] for example) are unlikely to be modular. Fodor, a strict [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalist]], rejects the idea that the neurological properties of the brain have any bearing on its cognitive properties and doubts the whole discipline of cognitive neuropsychology.

With improved neuroimaging techniques, it has been possible to correlate patterns of impairment with a knowledge of exactly which parts of the [[nervous system]] are damaged, allowing previously undiscovered functional relationships to be explored (the ''[[lesion]] method''). Contemporary cognitive neuropsychology uses many of the same techniques and technologies from the wider science of [[neuropsychology]] and fields such as [[cognitive neuroscience]]. These may include [[neuroimaging]], [[electrophysiology]] and [[neuropsychological tests]] to measure either brain function or psychological performance. Useful technology in cognitive neuropsychology includes positron-emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These techniques make it possible to identify the areas of the brain responsible for performing certain cognitive tasks by measuring blood flow in the brain. PET scans sense the low-level radiation in the brain and produce 3-D images, whereas an fMRI works on a magnetic signal and is used to “map the brain”. Electroencephalography (EEG) records the brain’s electrical activity and can identify changes that occur over milliseconds. EEG is often used in patients with epilepsy to detect seizure activity.

The principles of cognitive neuropsychology have recently been applied to [[mental illness]], with a view to understanding, for example, what the study of [[delusion]]s may tell us about the function of normal belief. This relatively young field is known as [[cognitive neuropsychiatry]].

'''Construction''', also referred as construction/reconstruction is a widely used, yet vaguely defined topic of modern [[psychoanalysis]]. According to its proponents, [[Freud]] in his later writings had already distinguished between construction and interpretation, hence construction/reconstruction is being a kind of "upgrade" of interpretation. There is a strong difference between simple interpretation and construction concerning how to see the past. In the interpretations the past is discovered as a preexisting phenomenon, while in the construction the past is not just simply found, but it is also created.

In the therapeutical setting a simple interpretation of the patient's claims is usually leading to a conterproductive debate about who is more correct, the patient or the [[psychoanalyst|analyst]]. The construction is attended to overcome this debate by using only the patient´s material, without the invasions from the analsyst's side (a resemblance to methods of Malan and Davanloo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.sk/books?id=9zcEXiuo8E8C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=malan+davanloo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cZ4vvE0t_r&amp;sig=8E3ZM2UMglBX0kzasZnWWZoFL58&amp;hl=sk&amp;ei=mCT_TdOeOsOcOui56d4I&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=malan%20davanloo&amp;f=false Malan and Davanloo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The patient, unable to avoid the truth (the situation that his/her truth is discovered), is either producing a confession (hence validating the construction), or producing further [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] and [[association (psychology)|associations]].

A professionally led construction is inescapable, as it does not use persuasion, paradoxical intentions, etc. 
Elements of construction are traceable e.g. in the [[intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy]], in the [[Reid technique|Reid's interrogation technique]], or in diplomatic/political discourses (e.g. [[William Ury]]'s approach in ''[[Getting to Yes]]'').{{cn|date=December 2016}}

== Criticism ==

Although construction is claimed to be a nondirective approach (it uses no contamination of the revealed [[psyche (psychology)|psychic]] material), the main criticism targets the effect of construction on human [[freedom (philosophy)|freedom]] and [[human dignity|dignity]]. 
Some critics state that the construction is especially attractive for those therapists who themselves are missing some parts of their own personality, and who by "depatterning" and "reassembling" the patient (see. [[Donald Ewen Cameron|Donald E. Cameron]]) are repeating their own personal losses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2405">In [[mathematics]] &amp;mdash; specifically, in [[large deviations theory]] &amp;mdash; the '''contraction principle''' is a [[theorem]] that states how a large deviation principle on one space "pushes forward" (via the [[Pushforward measure|pushforward]] of a probability measure) to a large deviation principle on another space ''via'' a [[continuous function]].

==Statement of the theorem==

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological space]]s and let (''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be a family of [[probability measure]]s on ''X'' that satisfies the large deviation principle with [[rate function]] ''I''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞].  Let ''T''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' be a continuous function, and let ''&amp;nu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''T''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;) be the push-forward measure of ''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt; by ''T'', i.e., for each [[measurable set]]/event ''E''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''Y'',  ''&amp;nu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;(''E'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'')).  Let

:&lt;math&gt;J(y) := \inf \{ I(x) \mid x \in X \text{ and } T(x) = y \},&lt;/math&gt;

with the convention that the [[infimum]] of ''I'' over the [[empty set]] ∅ is +∞.  Then:
* ''J''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞] is a rate function on ''Y'',
* ''J'' is a good rate function on ''Y'' if ''I'' is a good rate function on ''X'', and
*  (''&amp;nu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&amp;gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies the large deviation principle on ''Y'' with rate function ''J''.

== Early life ==
Abernathy was born in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] and grew up in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. The Abernathy children, along with the King children, integrated Spring Street Elementary School and began mass integration in the South. Abernathy briefly attended the Northside High School for the Performing Arts, before attended and graduated from [[George School]], a Quaker Prep School in [[Bucks County]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.georgeschool.org/georgian-available-online-2/|title=Georgian Available Online - George School|date=2015-12-14|work=George School|access-date=2017-07-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father was Rev. [[Ralph Abernathy]], an influential leader in the Civil Rights Movement. She was able to join her father, her mother Juanita Jones Abernathy and witness first-hand many significant events of the Civil Rights Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CH1000154369&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=umd_um&amp;it=r&amp;p=LitRC&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=709710a142365457b52e2616f2e33827|title = Donzaleigh Abernathy|date = 2008|accessdate = 2015-04-04|website = Literature Resource Center|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family was very close to that of [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], another prominent figure of the Civil Rights Movement. The Abernathy and King children went to school together, performed extracurricular activities together, spent Sunday Dinners together, vacations and various holidays together. According to Abernathy herself, children from both families would hold performances for their parents on these occasions with [[Yolanda King]], one of King's daughters, acting as the director and Dr. King filming the performances. Abernathy acknowledges that "that's really when [she] started acting."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=McEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title = Ralph Abernathy's daughter, Donzaleigh, gets role in TV western drama, 'Ned Blessing'|last = |first = |date = 23 August 1993|journal = Jet Magazine|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 84|pages = 38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is married to actor/producer Dar Dixon Bijarchi.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Work ==
After graduating from [[Emerson College]] in [[Boston]], Abernathy moved to [[New York City|New York]]. She landed her first job after auditioning for a role with the Off Off Broadway production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since then, Abernathy has played roles in many different movies and television series. In the historical drama ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'', she portrays a slave named Martha. Although the film itself was not critically well-received, Abernathy was praised for her part. One reviewer states that "Abernathy's image of Martha combines strength with glamour." She starred for four years as a series regular on Lifetime's ''[[Any Day Now (TV series)|Any Day Now]]''. As a child of the South, Abernathy was heavily influenced by the civil rights movement. As a result, she was able to connect with the role on a personal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=e3f40cc4-f2d3-4642-b428-aba97a323e2e%40sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4201&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=9160590|title = Civil rights daughter fights civil war for 'Gods and Generals'|last = Pryce|first = Vinette K.|date = 13 February 2003|work = New York Amsterdam News|access-date = 2015-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Donzaleigh Abernathy claims she was filming a scene with Omar Epps in May 2016 for the USA show "Shooter" where his character was supposed to murder her character, when he "completely deviated from the script" and "threw his left forearm with full force at [her] right arm," and broke it. Abernathy is suing Epps, along with Paramount Pictures, for negligence and assault and battery. She's asking for damages for her pain and suffering and wants her medical costs -- present and future -- covered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tmz.com/2018/02/15/omar-epps-sued-shooter-actress-assault-battery-injury/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energetics''' (also called '''energy economics''') is the study of energy under [[energy transformation|transformation]]. Because energy flows at all scales, from the [[quantum physics|quantum]] level to the [[biosphere]] and [[cosmos]], energetics is a very broad discipline, encompassing for example [[thermodynamics]], [[chemistry]], [[Biological thermodynamics|biological energetics]], [[biochemistry]] and [[ecological energetics]]. Where each branch of energetics begins and ends is a topic of constant debate. For example, Lehninger (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;21) contended that when the science of thermodynamics deals with energy exchanges of all types, it can be called energetics.

==Aims==
In general, energetics is concerned with defining relationships to describe the tendencies of [[energy transfer|energy flows]] and [[energy storage|storages]] under transformation, defined here as phenomena which behave like historical invariants under repeated observations. When some critical number of people have observed such invariance, such a principle is usually then given the status of a '[[Physical law|fundamental law]]' of science. As in all scientific inquiry, whether a theorem or principle is considered a fundamental law appears to depend on how many people agree to the proposition. The ultimate aim of energetics therefore is the description of fundamental laws. Philosophers of science have held that the fundamental [[laws of thermodynamics]] can be treated as laws of energetics, (Reiser 1926, p.&amp;nbsp;432). By continuing to more accurately describe these laws, energetics aims to produce reliable predictions about energy flow and storage transformations at any scale.

==History==
Energetics has a controversial history. Some authors maintain that the its origins may be found in the work of the ancient Greeks, but that the mathematical formalisation began with the work of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. [[Richard de Villamil]] (1928) said that [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine]] formulated the science of energetics in his paper ''Outlines of the Science of Energetics'' published in the Proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow in 1855. W. Ostwald and E. Mach subsequently developed the study, and by the late 1800s energetics was understood to be incompatible with the atomic view of the atom forwarded by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]]'s gas theory. Proof of the atom settled the dispute but not without significant damage. In the 1920s [[Lotka]] attempted to build on Boltzmann's views through a mathematical synthesis of energetics with biological evolutionary theory. Lotka proposed that the selective principle of evolution was one which favoured the maximum useful energy flow transformation. This view subsequently influenced the further development of ecological energetics, especially the work of [[Howard T. Odum]].

De Villamil attempted to clarify the scope of energetics with respect to other branches of physics by positing a system that divides [[mechanics]] into two branches; energetics (the science of [[energy]]), and "pure", "abstract" or "rigid" [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] (the science of [[momentum]]). According to Villamil energetics can be mathematically characterised by scalar equations, and rigid dynamics by vector equations. In this division the dimensions for dynamics are ''space'', time and mass, and for energetics, ''length'', time and mass (Villamil 1928, p.&amp;nbsp;9). This division is made according to fundamental suppositions about the properties of bodies, e.g.:

# Are the particles comprising the system rigidly fixed together?
# Is there any machinery for stopping moving bodies?

In Villamil's classification system, dynamics says yes to 1 and no to 2, whereas energetics says no to 1 and yes to 2. Therefore, in Villamil's system, dynamics assumes that particles are rigidly fixed together and cannot vibrate, and consequently must all be at zero kelvin. The [[conservation of momentum]] is a consequence of this view, however it is considered valid only in logic and not to be a true representation of the facts (Villamil, p.&amp;nbsp;96). In contrast energetics does not assume that particles are rigidly fixed together, and thus are free to vibrate, and consequently can be at non-zero temperatures.

==Theories==
[[Image:Genomics GTL Program Payoffs.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Ecological analysis of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in an [[ecosystem]]]]
As a general statement of energy flows under transformation, the principles of energetics include the first four [[laws of thermodynamics]] which seek a rigorous description. However the precise place of the laws of thermodynamics within the principles of energetics is a topic currently under debate. If the ecologist [[Howard T. Odum]] was right, the principles of energetics take into consideration a hierarchical ordering of energy forms, which aims to account for the concept of [[energy quality]], and the evolution of the universe. [[Albert Lehninger]] (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;2) called these hierarchical orderings the

{{quote|... successive stages in the flow of energy through the biological macrocosm}}

Odum proposed 3 further energetic principles and one corollary that take [[Energy quality#Ranking_energy_quality|energy hierarchy]] into account. The first four principles of energetics are related to the same numbered laws of [[thermodynamics]], and are expanded upon in that article.

'''Exemplification''', in the [[philosophy]] of language, is a mode of symbolization characterized by the relation between a sample and what it refers to.

== Description ==
Unlike [[ostension]], which is the act of showing or pointing to a sample, exemplification is possession of a property plus reference to its label (Goodman, 1976). For example, if a color sample has the property labelled 'green', then the color sample exemplifies green. At its most basic, possession of a property amounts to being correctly referred to by its label. In other words, an entity, 'x' can be said to possess a certain property if and only if: (1) there can be an abstract singular term which denotes that property, and (2) those assertions are true which predicate such an abstract term of a name or phrase denoting x. 
== A mode of reference ==

[[Reference]] is the relation between something "standing for" something else, like the relation between a word and what it denotes. Usually reference goes in one direction, from the word to what it denotes, but it may also go in both directions, from the denoted back to the word. For instance, when a patch of green paint is used as a colour sample. The sample refers to green by possessing it and thus being referred to by the word denoting it. The sample exemplifies green, it stands for it, and in this way exemplification is a mode of reference.

== Uses of exemplification ==

*Product samples exemplify certain properties they possess.
*As a part in [[ostensive definition]], i.e. definition by exemplification of what is defined. For example, an artist can define a new style by showing works that exemplify it.
*Defined exemplification is a pattern of essay development that uses specific instances (examples) to clarify a point, to add interest, or to persuade (Clouse, 2006).
*Exemplification means using examples to explain, convince, or amuse. Lending interest and information to writing, exemplification is one of the most common and effective ways to developing ideas. Examples may be developed in a sentence or more, or they may be only phrases or even single words, as in the following sentence: "Children like packaged breakfast foods, such as Wheaties, Cheerios, and Rice Krispies."

The '''Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire''' (FFMQ) is a psychological measurement to explore [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]]. It is based on five independently developed mindfulness questionnaires that are bound together in a factor analytic study. The questionnaire consists of 39 items. The five facets are: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience.

==Criticism==
The FFMQ has been criticised, with specifics including that negative and positive wording constituted substantive method effects.&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1073191112438743&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Formosan clouded leopard''' (''Neofelis nebulosa brachyura'') was a [[clouded leopard]] [[subspecies]] that was [[endemic]] to the island of [[Taiwan]]. A [[camera trap]]ping study carried out in the largest remaining lowland [[primary forest]] in southern Taiwan during 2000 to 2004 did not reveal the presence of a clouded leopard.&lt;ref name=Chiang2007&gt;Chiang, P.-J. (2007). [http://cloudedleopard.org/documents/Formosan%20clouded%20leopard%20Po-Jen%20Chiang%202007.pdf ''Ecology and Conservation of the Formosan clouded leopard, its prey, and other sympatric carnivores in southern Taiwan'']. PhD dissertation submitted to the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
In his first description of 1862, [[Robert Swinhoe|Swinhoe]] notes the shortness of the tail, which is about one-half the length of clouded leopard specimens from the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref&gt;Swinhoe, R. (1862). ''On the Mammals of the Island of Formosa''. Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London: 347–365.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Last records ==
[[File:Specimen of Neofelis nebulosa brachyura in National Taiwan Museum.JPG|thumb|Specimen in the [[National Taiwan Museum]]]]
The Formosan clouded leopard was Taiwan's second-largest [[carnivore]], after the [[Formosan black bear]]. Following extensive [[logging]] of its natural habitat, clouded leopards retreated into the [[Yushan Range|Jade Mountain]] and Tawu Mountain. Today, the ''Tawu Mountain Nature Reserve'' is a protected area encompassing about {{convert|480|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} that harbours the largest remaining primary forest in southern Taiwan and comprises [[tropical rainforest|tropical]] and [[subtropical rainforest]] as well as [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]] and [[temperate coniferous forest]].&lt;ref name=Chiang2007/&gt;

An interview survey conducted in 1986 among 70 [[Taiwanese aborigines|indigenous]] hunters revealed that the last confirmed sighting of a Formosan clouded leopard occurred in the Tawu Mountain area in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, A. (1988). ''The clouded leopard in Taiwan''. Oryx 22 (1): 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; The last confirmed record dates to 1989, when the skin of a young individual was found in the [[Taroko National Park|Taroko]] area.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (1996). ''The mystery of the Formosan clouded leopard''. Cat News 24: 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8648">In [[mathematics]], a '''Grothendieck universe''' is a set ''U'' with the following properties:

# If ''x'' is an element of ''U'' and if ''y'' is an element of ''x'', then ''y'' is also an element of ''U''. (''U'' is a [[transitive set]].)
# If ''x'' and ''y'' are both elements of ''U'', then {''x'',''y''} is an element of ''U''.
# If ''x'' is an element of ''U'', then ''P''(''x''), the [[power set]] of ''x'', is also an element of ''U''.
# If &lt;math&gt;\{x_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in I}&lt;/math&gt; is a family of elements of ''U'', and if ''I'' is an element of ''U'', then the union &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{\alpha\in I} x_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is an element of ''U''.

A Grothendieck universe is meant to provide a set in which all of mathematics can be performed.  (In fact, uncountable Grothendieck universes provide [[model theory|models]] of set theory with the natural ∈-relation, natural powerset operation etc.). Elements of a Grothendieck universe are sometimes called '''small sets'''. The idea of universes is due to [[Alexander Grothendieck]], who used them as a way of avoiding [[proper class]]es in [[algebraic geometry]].

The existence of a nontrivial Grothendieck universe goes beyond the usual axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]]; in particular it would imply the existence of [[Inaccessible cardinal|strongly inaccessible cardinals]].
[[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]] is an axiomatic treatment of set theory, used in some automatic proof systems, in which every set belongs to a Grothendieck universe.
The concept of a Grothendieck universe can also be defined in a [[topos]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Properties==
As an example, we will prove an easy proposition.

:'''Proposition'''. If &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \subseteq x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;y \in U&lt;/math&gt;.
:Proof. &lt;math&gt;y \in P(x)&lt;/math&gt;  because &lt;math&gt;y \subseteq x&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;P(x) \in U&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;y \in U&lt;/math&gt;.

It is similarly easy to prove that any Grothendieck universe ''U'' contains:
* All [[singleton (mathematics)|singletons]] of each of its elements,
* All products of all families of elements of ''U'' indexed by an element of ''U'',
* All disjoint unions of all families of elements of ''U'' indexed by an element of ''U'',
* All intersections of all families of elements of ''U'' indexed by an element of ''U'',
* All functions between any two elements of ''U'', and
* All subsets of ''U'' whose cardinal is an element of ''U''.

In particular, it follows from the last axiom that if ''U'' is non-empty, it must contain all of its finite subsets and a subset of each finite cardinality.  One can also prove immediately from the definitions that the intersection of any class of universes is a universe.

== Grothendieck universes and inaccessible cardinals ==
There are two simple examples of Grothendieck universes:
* The empty set, and
* The set of all [[hereditarily finite set]]s &lt;math&gt;V_\omega&lt;/math&gt;.
Other examples are more difficult to construct.  Loosely speaking, this is because Grothendieck universes are equivalent to [[Inaccessible cardinal|strongly inaccessible cardinal]]s.  More formally, the following two axioms are equivalent:

: (U) For each set ''x'', there exists a Grothendieck universe ''U'' such that ''x'' ∈ ''U''.
: (C) For each cardinal κ, there is a strongly inaccessible cardinal λ that is strictly larger than κ.

To prove this fact, we introduce the function '''c'''(''U'').  Define:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}(U) = \sup_{x \in U} |x|&lt;/math&gt;
where by |''x''| we mean the cardinality of ''x''.  Then for any universe ''U'', '''c'''(''U'') is either zero or strongly inaccessible.  Assuming it is non-zero, it is a strong limit cardinal because the power set of any element of ''U'' is an element of ''U'' and every element of ''U'' is a subset of ''U''.  To see that it is regular, suppose that ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; is a collection of cardinals indexed by ''I'', where the cardinality of ''I'' and of each ''c&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;'' is less than '''c'''(''U'').  Then, by the definition of '''c'''(''U''), ''I'' and each ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; can be replaced by an element of ''U''.  The union of elements of ''U'' indexed by an element of ''U'' is an element of ''U'', so the sum of the ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; has the cardinality of an element of ''U'', hence is less than '''c'''(''U'').  By invoking the axiom of foundation, that no set is contained in itself, it can be shown that '''c'''(''U'') equals |''U''|; when the axiom of foundation is not assumed, there are counterexamples (we may take for example U to be the set of all finite sets of finite sets etc. of the sets x&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; where the index &amp;alpha; is any real number, and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;/sub&gt; = {''x''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;/sub&gt;} for each ''&amp;alpha;''. Then ''U'' has the cardinality of the continuum, but all of its members have finite cardinality and so &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}(U) = \aleph_0 &lt;/math&gt; ; see Bourbaki's article for more details).

Let κ be a strongly inaccessible cardinal.  Say that a set ''S'' is strictly of type κ if for any sequence ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ... ∈ ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''S'', |''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; ''κ''.  (''S'' itself corresponds to the empty sequence.)  Then the set ''u''(''κ'') of all sets strictly of type κ is a Grothendieck universe of cardinality κ.  The proof of this fact is long, so for details, we again refer to Bourbaki's article, listed in the references.

To show that the large cardinal axiom (C) implies the universe axiom (U), choose a set ''x''.  Let ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''x'', and for each ''n'', let ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\bigcup&lt;/math&gt; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be the union of the elements of ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.  Let ''y'' = &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_n&lt;/math&gt;''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.  By (C), there is a strongly inaccessible cardinal κ such that |y| &lt; κ.  Let ''u''(''κ'') be the universe of the previous paragraph.  ''x'' is strictly of type κ, so ''x'' ∈ ''u''(''κ'').  To show that the universe axiom (U) implies the large cardinal axiom (C), choose a cardinal κ.  κ is a set, so it is an element of a Grothendieck universe ''U''.  The cardinality of ''U'' is strongly inaccessible and strictly larger than that of κ.

In fact, any Grothendieck universe is of the form ''u''(''κ'') for some κ.  This gives another form of the equivalence between Grothendieck universes and strongly inaccessible cardinals:

:For any Grothendieck universe ''U'', |''U''| is either zero, &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;, or a strongly inaccessible cardinal. And if κ is zero, &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;, or a strongly inaccessible cardinal, then there is a Grothendieck universe u(κ).  Furthermore, ''u''(|''U''|) = ''U'', and |''u''(''κ'')| = ''κ''.

Since the existence of strongly inaccessible cardinals cannot be proved from the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZFC), the existence of universes other than the empty set and &lt;math&gt;V_\omega&lt;/math&gt; cannot be proved from ZFC either.   However, strongly inaccessible cardinals are on the lower end of the [[List of large cardinal properties|list of large cardinals]]; thus, most set theories that use large cardinals (such as "ZFC plus there is a [[measurable cardinal]]", "ZFC plus there are infinitely many [[Woodin cardinal]]s") will prove that Grothendieck universes exist.

'''Habitat fragmentation''' describes the emergence of discontinuities (fragmentation) in an organism's preferred [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] ([[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]), causing [[population fragmentation]] and  [[ecosystem decay]]. Causes of habitat fragmentation include [[geological]] processes that slowly alter the layout of the physical environment&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;

==Definition==
The term habitat fragmentation includes five discrete phenomena:
* Reduction in the total area of the habitat
* Decrease of the interior: [[edge effect|edge]] ratio
* Isolation of one habitat fragment from other areas of habitat
* Breaking up of one patch of habitat into several smaller patches
* Decrease in the average size of each patch of habitat

"fragmentation ... not only causes loss of the amount of habitat, but by creating small, isolated patches it also changes the properties of the remaining habitat" (van den Berg et al. 2001){{Failed verification|date=April 2018}}. Habitat fragmentation is the landscape level of the phenomenon, and patch level process. Thus meaning, it covers; the patch areas, edge effects, and patch shape complexity.&lt;ref&gt;van den Berg LJL, Bullock JM, Clarke RT, Langsten RHW, Rose RJ. 2001. Territory selection by the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata) in Dorset, England: the role of vegetation type, habitat fragmentation and population size. Biol. Conserv. 101:217-28
&lt;/ref&gt;

In scientific literature, there is some debate whether the term "habitat fragmentation" applies in cases of habitat loss, or whether the term primarily applies to the phenomenon of habitat being cut into smaller pieces without significant reduction in habitat area. Scientists who use the stricter definition of "habitat fragmentation" per se&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; would refer to loss of habitat area as "habitat loss" and explicitly mention both terms if describing a situation where the habitat becomes less connected and there is less overall habitat.

== Causes ==

===Natural causes===
Evidence of [[habitat destruction]] through natural processes such as [[volcanism]], fire, and [[climate change]] is found in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}} For example, [[Carboniferous rainforest collapse|habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica]] 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity, but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;

===Human causes===
Habitat fragmentation is frequently caused by humans when [[native plant]]s is cleared for human activities such as [[agriculture]], [[Subdivision (land)|rural development]], [[urbanization]] and the creation of [[hydroelectric]] reservoirs. Habitats which were once continuous become divided into separate fragments. After intensive clearing, the separate fragments tend to be very small islands isolated from each other by cropland, pasture, pavement, or even barren land. The latter is often the result of [[slash and burn]] farming in [[tropical forest]]s. In the wheat belt of central western [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], 90% of the native vegetation has been cleared and over 99% of the [[tall grass prairie]] of [[North America]] has been cleared, resulting in extreme habitat fragmentation.

=== Endogenous vs. exogenous  ===
There are two types of processes that can lead to habitat fragmentation. There are exogenous processes and endogenous processes. Endogenous are process that develop as a part of a species biology so they typically include changes in biology, behavior and interactions within or between species. Endogenous threats can result in changes to breeding patterns or migration patterns and are often triggered by exogenous processes. Exogenous processes are independent of species biology and can include habitat degradation, habitat subdivision or habitat isolation. These processes can have a substantial impact on endogenous processes by fundamentally altering species behavior. Habitat subdivision or isolation can lead to changes in dispersal or movement of species including changes to seasonal migration. These changes can lead to decrease in a density of species, increased competition or even increased predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Joern|last2=Lindenmayer|first2=David B.|date=February 7, 2007|title=Landscape Modification and Habitat Fragmentation: A synthesis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|volume=16|issue=3|pages=265–280|doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|accessdate=March 22, 2018|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications ==

=== Habitat Loss and Biodiversity ===
One of the major ways that habitat fragmentation affects [[biodiversity]] is by reducing the amount of suitable habitat available for organisms. Habitat fragmentation often involves both [[habitat destruction]] and the subdivision of previously continuous habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahrig|first1=Lenore|title=Effects of Habitat Fragmentation on Biodiversity|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|date=November 2003|volume=34|issue=1|pages=487–515|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants and other [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms are disproportionately affected by some types of habitat fragmentation because they cannot respond quickly to the altered spatial configuration of the habitat.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lienert|first1=Judit|title=Habitat fragmentation effects on fitness of plant populations – a review|journal=Journal for Nature Conservation|date=July 2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–72|doi=10.1016/j.jnc.2003.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habitat loss, which can occur through the process of habitat fragmentation, is considered to be the greatest threat to species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilcove | first1 = David S. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1998 | title = Quantifying Threats to Imperiled Species in the United States | jstor = 1313420 | journal = BioScience | volume = 48 | issue = 8| pages = 607–615 | doi=10.2307/1313420}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, the effect of the configuration of habitat patches within the landscape, independent of the effect of the amount of habitat within the landscape (referred to as fragmentation per se&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fahrig | first1 = L | year = 2003 | title = Effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 487–515 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132419}}&lt;/ref&gt;), has been suggested to be small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fahrig | first1 = L | year = 2013 | title = Rethinking patch size and isolation effects: the habitat amount hypothesis | url = | journal = J. Biogeogr. | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 1649–1663 | doi = 10.1111/jbi.12130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of empirical studies found that, of the 381 reported significant effect of habitat fragmentation per se on species occurrences, abundances or diversity in the scientific literature, 76% were positive whereas 24% were negative.&lt;ref name="Fahrig2017"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fahrig | first1 = L | year = 2017 | title = Ecological Responses to Habitat Fragmentation Per Se | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 1–23 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110316-022612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these results, the scientific literature tends to emphasize negative effects more than positive effects.&lt;ref&gt;Fahrig, L. (2018) Forty years of biais in habitat fragmentation research, In: Effective Conservation Science: Data Not Dogma (Edited by Kareiva, Marvier and Silliman), Oxford University Press, United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt; Positive effects of habitat fragmentation per se imply that several small patches of habitat can have higher conservation value than a single large patch of equivalent size.&lt;ref name="Fahrig2017" /&gt; Land sharing strategies could therefore have more positive impacts on species than land sparing strategies.&lt;ref name="Fahrig2017" /&gt;[[File:Indiana Dunes Habitat Fragmentation.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Habitat fragmented by numerous roads near the [[Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore]].]]
Area is the primary determinant of the number of species in a fragment&lt;ref name = Rosenzweig&gt;{{cite book | last = Rosenzweig | first = Michael L. | authorlink = Michael Rosenzweig | title = Species diversity in space and time | year = 1995 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the relative contributions of demographic and genetic processes to the risk of global population extinction depend on habitat configuration, stochastic environmental variation and species features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robert | first1 = A | year = 2011 | title = Find the weakest link. A comparison between demographic, genetic and demo-genetic metapopulation extinction times | url = | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 11 | issue = | page = 260 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-11-260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minor fluctuations in climate, resources, or other factors that would be unremarkable and quickly corrected in large populations can be catastrophic in small, isolated populations. Thus fragmentation of habitat is an important cause of species extinction.&lt;ref name = Rosenzweig/&gt; Population dynamics of subdivided populations tend to vary [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]]ly. In an unfragmented landscape a declining population can be "rescued" by immigration from a nearby expanding population. In fragmented landscapes, the distance between fragments may prevent this from happening. Additionally, unoccupied fragments of habitat that are separated from a source of [[Colonisation (biology)|immigrants]] by some barrier are less likely to be repopulated than adjoining fragments. Even small species such as the [[Columbia spotted frog]] are reliant on the rescue effect. Studies showed 25% of juveniles travel a distance over 200m compared to 4% of adults. Of these, 95% remain in their new locale, demonstrating that this journey is necessary for survival.&lt;ref name = Funk&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Funk W.C. |author2=Greene A.E. |author3=Corn P.S. |author4=Allendorf F.W. | year = 2005 | title = High dispersal in a frog species suggests that it is vulnerable to habitat fragmentation | url = | journal = [[Biology Letters|Biol. Lett.]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 13–6 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2004.0270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, habitat fragmentation leads to [[edge effect]]s. Microclimatic changes in light, temperature and wind can alter the ecology around the fragment, and in the interior and exterior portions of the fragment. [[wildfire|Fires]] become more likely in the area as humidity drops and temperature and wind levels rise. Exotic and pest species may establish themselves easily in such disturbed environments, and the proximity of domestic animals often upsets the natural ecology. Also, habitat along the edge of a fragment has a different climate and favours different species from the interior habitat. Small fragments are therefore unfavourable for species which require interior habitat. The percentage preservation of contiguous habitats is closely related to both genetic and species biodiversity preservation.  Generally a 10% remnant contiguous habitat will result in a 50% [[biodiversity loss]].&lt;ref&gt;Quammen, David (1997), "The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction" (Scribner)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informed Conservation===
Habitat fragmentation is often a cause of species becoming [[threatened]] or [[endangered]]. The existence of viable habitat is critical to the survival of any species, and in many cases the fragmentation of any remaining habitat can lead to difficult decisions for conservation biologists. Given a limited amount of resources available for conservation is it preferable to protect the existing isolated patches of habitat or to buy back land to get the largest possible continuous piece of land. In rare cases a [[conservation reliant species]] may gain some measure of disease protection by being distributed in isolated habitats.  This ongoing debate is often referred to as [[SLOSS debate|SLOSS]] (Single Large or Several Small).

One solution to the problem of habitat fragmentation is to link the fragments by preserving or planting [[Habitat corridor|corridors]] of native vegetation. In some cases, a bridge or underpass may be enough to join two fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildlife Crossings: Animals survive with bridges and tunnels|url=http://www.wilderutopia.com/environment/wildlife/wildlife-crossings-animals-survive-bridges-tunnels/|publisher=Wilder Eutopia|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has the potential to mitigate the problem of isolation but not the loss of interior habitat.

Another mitigation measure is the enlargement of small remnants in order to increase the amount of interior habitat. This may be impractical since developed land is often more expensive and could require significant time and effort to restore.

The best solution is generally dependent on the particular species or ecosystem that is being considered. More mobile species, like most birds, do not need connected habitat while some smaller animals, like rodents, may be more exposed to predation in open land. These questions generally fall under the headings of [[metapopulation]]s [[island biogeography]].

=== Genetic Risks ===
As the remaining habitat patches are smaller, they tend to support smaller populations of fewer species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simberloff|first1=Daniel|date=1 January 1998|title=Small and Declining Populations|journal=Conservation Science and Action|language=en|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|pages=116–134|doi=10.1002/9781444313499.ch6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small populations are at an increased risk of a variety of genetic consequences that influence their long-term survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to conservation genetics|last1=Frankham|first1=Richard|last2=Ballou|first2=Jonathan D.|last3=Briscoe|first3=David A.|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521702713|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remnant populations often contain only a subset of the [[genetic diversity]] found in the previously continuous habitat.  Processes that act upon underlying genetic diversity such as [[adaptation]] have a smaller pool of fitness-maintaining alleles to survive in the face of environmental change.

==== Gene Flow and Inbreeding ====
[[Gene flow]] occurs when individuals of the same species exchange genetic information through reproduction. Populations can maintain genetic diversity through [[Animal migration|migration]]. When a habitat becomes fragmented and reduced in area, gene flow and migration is typically reduced. Fewer individuals will migrate into the remaining fragments, and small disconnected populations that may have once been part of a single large population will become reproductively isolated. Scientific evidence that gene flow is reduced due to fragmentation depends on the study species. While trees that have long-range pollination and dispersal mechanisms may not experience reduced gene flow following fragmentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=KRAMER|first=ANDREA T.|last2=ISON|first2=JENNIFER L.|last3=ASHLEY|first3=MARY V.|last4=HOWE|first4=HENRY F.|date=2008-06-09|title=The Paradox of Forest Fragmentation Genetics|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00944.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=878–885|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00944.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt; most species are at risk of reduced gene flow following habitat fragmentation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Reduced gene flow, and reproductive isolation can result in [[inbreeding]] between related individuals. Inbreeding does not always result in negative fitness consequences, but when inbreeding is associated with fitness reduction it is called [[inbreeding depression]]. Inbreeding becomes of increasing concern as the level of [[homozygosity]] increases, facilitating the expression of deleterious alleles that reduce the fitness. Habitat fragmentation can lead to inbreeding depression for many species due to reduced gene flow.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pavlova|first=Alexandra|last2=Beheregaray|first2=Luciano B.|last3=Coleman|first3=Rhys|last4=Gilligan|first4=Dean|last5=Harrisson|first5=Katherine A.|last6=Ingram|first6=Brett A.|last7=Kearns|first7=Joanne|last8=Lamb|first8=Annika M.|last9=Lintermans|first9=Mark|date=2017-05-11|title=Severe consequences of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity of an endangered Australian freshwater fish: A call for assisted gene flow |journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=10|issue=6|pages=531–550|doi=10.1111/eva.12484|issn=1752-4571|pmc=5469170|pmid=28616062}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=W|last2=Qiao|first2=Y|last3=Li|first3=S|last4=Pan|first4=W|last5=Yao|first5=M|date=2017-02-15|title=Low genetic diversity and strong population structure shaped by anthropogenic habitat fragmentation in a critically endangered primate, Trachypithecus leucocephalus|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy20172|journal=Heredity |volume=118|issue=6|pages=542–553|doi=10.1038/hdy.2017.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inbreeding depression is associated with conservation risks, like local extinction.

==== Genetic Drift ====
Small populations are more susceptible to [[genetic drift]]. Genetic drift is random changes to the genetic make up of populations and always leads to reductions in genetic diversity. The smaller the population is, the more likely genetic drift will be a driving force of evolution rather than natural selection. Because genetic drift is a random process, it does not allow species to become more adapted to their environment. Habitat fragmentation is associated with increases to genetic drift in small populations which can have negative consequences for the genetic diversity of the populations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Adaptation ====
In order for populations to evolve in response to natural selection, they must be large enough that natural selection is a stronger evolutionary force than genetic drift. Recent studies on the impacts of habitat fragmentation on adaptation in some plant species have suggested that organisms in fragmented landscapes may be able to adapt to fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matesanz|first=Silvia|last2=Teso|first2=Rubio|last3=Luisa|first3=María|last4=García-Fernández|first4=Alfredo|last5=Escudero|first5=Adrián|date=2017|title=Habitat Fragmentation Differentially Affects Genetic Variation, Phenotypic Plasticity and Survival in Populations of a Gypsum Endemic|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.00843/full|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|language=English|volume=8|doi=10.3389/fpls.2017.00843|issn=1664-462X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dubois|first=Jonathan|last2=Cheptou|first2=Pierre-Olivier|date=2017-01-19|title=Effects of fragmentation on plant adaptation to urban environments|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/372/1712/20160038|journal=Phil.

=== Effect on Animal Behaviours===
Although the way habitat fragmentation affects the genetics and extinction rates of species has been heavily studied, fragmentation has also been shown to affect species' behaviours and cultures as well. This is important because social interactions have the ability to determine and have an effect on a species' fitness and survival. Habitat fragmentation alters the resources available and the structure of habitats, as a result alters the behaviours of species and the dynamics between differing species. Behaviours affected can be within a species such as reproduction, mating, foraging, species dispersal, communication and movement patterns or can be behaviours between species such as predator prey relationships. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Predation Behaviours ====
Habitat fragmentation due to anthropogenic activities has been shown to greatly affect the predator-prey dynamics of many species by altering the amount of species and the members of those species. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affects the natural predator-prey relationships between animals in a given community &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forces them to alter their behaviours and interactions, therefore resetting the so called "behavioral space race" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shneider |first1=Michael F |title=Habitat loss, fragmentation and predator impact: spatial implications for prey conservation |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2001 |volume=38 |page=720-735}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The way in which fragmentation changes and re-shapes these interactions can occur in many different forms. Most prey species have patches of land that are refuge from their predators, allowing them the safety to reproduce and raise their young. Human introduced structures such as roads and pipelines alter these areas by facilitating predator activity in these refuges, increasing predator-prey overlap &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shneider |first1=Michael F |title=Habitat loss, fragmentation and predator impact: spatial implications for prey conservation |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2001 |volume=38 |page=720-735}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The opposite could also occur in the favour of prey, increasing prey refuge and subsequently decreasing predation rates. Fragmentation may also increase predator abundance or predator efficiency and therefore increase predation rates in this manner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shneider |first1=Michael F |title=Habitat loss, fragmentation and predator impact: spatial implications for prey conservation |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2001 |volume=38 |page=720-735}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Several other factors can also increase or decrease the extent to which the shifting predator-prey dynamics affect certain species, including how diverse a predators diet is and how flexible habitat requirements are for predators and prey &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Depending on which species are affected and these other factors, fragmentation and its resulting effects on predator-prey dynamics may contribute to a species extinction &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In response to these new environmental pressures, new adaptive behaviours may be developed. Prey species may adapt to increased risk of predation with strategies such as altering mating tactics or changing behaviours and activities related to food and foraging &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
===== Boreal Woodland Caribous =====
In the boreal woodland caribous of British Columbia the effects of fragmentation are clearly demonstrated. The species refuge area is peatland bog which has been interrupted by linear features such as roads and pipelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeMars |first1=Craig A |last2=Boutin |first2=Stan |title=Nowhere to hide: Effects of linear features on predator -prey dynamics in a large mammal system |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=September 4, 2017 |volume=87 |page=274-284 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12760}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These features have allowed their natural predators, the wolf and the black bear to more efficiently travel over landscapes and between patches of land&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeMars |first1=Craig A |last2=Boutin |first2=Stan |title=Nowhere to hide: Effects of linear features on predator -prey dynamics in a large mammal system |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=September 4, 2017 |volume=87 |page=274-284 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12760}}&lt;/ref&gt;.Since their predators can more easily access the caribous' refuge, the females of the species attempt to avoid the area, affecting their reproductive behaviours and offspring produced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeMars |first1=Craig A |last2=Boutin |first2=Stan |title=Nowhere to hide: Effects of linear features on predator -prey dynamics in a large mammal system |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=September 4, 2017 |volume=87 |page=274-284 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12760}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
==== Communication Behaviours ====
Fragmentation affecting the communication behaviours of birds has been well studied in Dupont's Lark. The Larks primarily reside in regions of Spain and are a small passerine bird which use songs as a means of cultural transmission between members of the species &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeMars |first1=Craig A |last2=Boutin |first2=Stan |title=Nowhere to hide: Effects of linear features on predator -prey dynamics in a large mammal system |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=September 4, 2017 |volume=87 |page=274-284 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12760}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Larks have two distinct vocalizations, the song and the territorial call. The territorial call is used by males to defend and signal territory from other male Larks and is shared between neighbouring territories when males respond to a rivals song &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Habitat fragmentation affects culture transmission: patterns of song matching in Dupont's lark |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2005 |volume=42 |page=1183-1193 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01093.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Occasionally it is used as a threat signal to signify an impending attack on territory &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Erosion of animal cultures in fragmented landscapes |journal=The Ecological Society of America |date=2007 |volume=5 |issue=2 |page=68-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A large song repertoire can enhance a males ability to survive and reproduce as he has a greater ability to defend his territory from other males, and a larger number of males in the species means a larger variety of songs being transmitted &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Habitat fragmentation affects culture transmission: patterns of song matching in Dupont's lark |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2005 |volume=42 |page=1183-1193 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01093.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fragmentation of the Dupont's Lark territory from agriculture, forestry and urbanization appears to have a large effect on their communication structures &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Erosion of animal cultures in fragmented landscapes |journal=The Ecological Society of America |date=2007 |volume=5 |issue=2 |page=68-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Males only perceive territories of a certain distance to be rivals and so isolation of territory from others due to fragmentation leads to a decrease in territorial calls as the males no longer have any reason to use it or have any songs to match &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Erosion of animal cultures in fragmented landscapes |journal=The Ecological Society of America |date=2007 |volume=5 |issue=2 |page=68-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
== Forest fragmentation ==
{{Commons category|Forest fragmentation}}
Forest fragmentation is a form of habitat fragmentation where forests are reduced (either naturally or man-made) to relatively small, isolated patches of forest known as forest fragments or forest remnants.&lt;ref name= "SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt; The intervening matrix that separates the remaining woodland patches can be natural open areas, [[farmland]], or developed areas. Following the principles of [[island biogeography]], remnant woodlands act like islands of forest in a sea of pastures, fields, subdivisions, shopping malls, etc. These fragments will then begin to undergo the process of [[ecosystem decay]].

Forest fragmentation also includes less subtle forms of discontinuities such as utility right-of-ways (ROWs). Utility ROWs are of ecological interest because they have become pervasive in many forest communities, spanning areas as large as 5 million acres in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=K.

Electricity transmission ROWs are created to prevent vegetation interference with transmission lines. Some studies have shown that electricity transmission ROWs harbor more plant species than adjoining forest areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=David L.|last2=Metzler|first2=Kenneth J.|last3=Leicht-Young|first3=Stacey A.|last4=Motzkin|first4=Glenn|date=2014-09-01|title=Vegetation composition along a New England transmission line corridor and its implications for other trophic levels|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112714002655|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|volume=327|pages=231–239|doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2014.04.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to alterations in the microclimate in and around the corridor. Discontinuities in forest areas associated with utility right-of-ways can serve as biodiversity havens for native bees &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and grassland species,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lampinen|first=Jussi|last2=Ruokolainen|first2=Kalle|last3=Huhta|first3=Ari-Pekka|date=2015-11-13|title=Urban Power Line Corridors as Novel Habitats for Grassland and Alien Plant Species in South-Western Finland|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0142236|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e0142236|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0142236|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4643934|pmid=26565700}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the right-of-ways are preserved in an early successional stage.

=== Implications ===
Forest fragmentation is one of the greatest threats to [[biodiversity]] in forests, especially in the tropics.&lt;ref name = Bierregaard&gt;{{cite book | last = Bierregaard | first = Richard | editor=Claude Gascon |editor2=Thomas E. Lovejoy |editor3=Rita Mesquita | year = 2001 | title = Lessons from Amazonia: The Ecology and Conservation of a Fragmented Forest | isbn = 0-300-08483-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The problem of [[habitat destruction]] that caused the fragmentation in the first place is compounded by:
* the inability of individual forest fragments to support viable populations, especially of large vertebrates
* the local [[extinction]] of species that do not have at least one fragment capable of supporting a viable population
* [[edge effect]]s that alter the conditions of the outer areas of the fragment, greatly reducing the amount of true forest interior habitat.&lt;ref name = Harris&gt;{{cite book | last = Harris | first = Larry D. | year = 1984 | title =  The Fragmented Forest: Island Biogeography Theory and the Preservation of Biotic Diversity | publisher = The University of Chicago Press |isbn = 0-226-31763-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of fragmentation on the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] of a forest patch depends on a) the size of the patch, and b) its degree of isolation.  Isolation depends on the distance to the nearest similar patch, and the contrast with the surrounding areas.  For example, if a cleared area is [[reforestation|reforested]] or allowed to [[natural regeneration|regenerate]], the increasing [[structural diversity]] of the [[vegetation]] will lessen the isolation of the forest fragments.  However, when formerly forested lands are converted permanently to pastures, agricultural fields, or human-inhabited developed areas, the remaining forest fragments, and the biota within them, are often highly isolated.

Forest patches that are smaller or more isolated will lose species faster than those that are larger or less isolated.  A large number of small forest "islands" typically cannot support the same biodiversity that a single contiguous forest would hold, even if their combined area is much greater than the single forest. However, forest islands in rural landscapes greatly increase their biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Banaszak J. (ed.) 2000. Ecology of Forest Islands. Bydgoszcz University Press, Bydgoszcz, Poland, 313 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches to understanding habitat fragmentation ==
Two approaches that are typically used to understand habitat fragmentation and its ecological impacts.

=== Species-oriented approach ===
The species-oriented approach focuses specifically on individual species and how they each respond to their environment and habitat changes with in it.
This approach can be limited because it does only focus on individual species and does not allow for a broad view of the impacts of habitat fragmentation across species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Joern|last2=Lindenmayer|first2=David B.|title=Landscape Modification and Habitat Fragmentation: A synthesis|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|date=February 7, 2007|volume=16|issue=3|pages=265–280|doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|accessdate=March 22, 2018|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pattern-oriented approach ====

The pattern-oriented approach is based on land cover and its patterning in correlation with species occurrences. One model of study for landscape patterning is the patch-matrix-corridor model developed by [[Richard Forman]] The pattern-oriented approach focuses on land cover defined by human means and activities. This model has stemmed from [[island biogeography]] and tries to infer causal relationships between the defined landscapes and the occurrence of species or groups of species within them. The approach has limitations in its collective assumptions across species or landscapes which may not account for variations amongst them.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Joern &amp; B. Lindenmayer, David. (2007). Landscape modification and habitat fragmentation: a synthesis. Global Ecology and Biogeography. 16. 265-280. 10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Variegation Model ====

The other model is the variegation model. Variegated landscapes retain much of their natural vegetation but are intermixed with gradients of modified habitat &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landscape Ecology and Landscape Change|url=http://www.veac.vic.gov.au/reports/Chapter%202%20-%20Landscape%20Ecology%20and%20Landscape%20Change.pdf|accessdate=March 22, 2018|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model of habitat fragmentation typically applies to landscapes that are modified by agriculture. In contrast to the fragmentation model that is denoted by isolated patches of habitat surrounded by unsuitable landscape environments, the variegation model applies to landscapes modified by agriculture where small patches of habitat remain near the remnant original habitat. In between these patches are a matrix of grassland that are often modified versions of the original habitat. These areas do not present as much of a barrier to native species.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, S., and G. W. Barrett. “Habitat Variegation, An Alternative to Fragmentation.” Conservation Biology, vol. 6, no. 1, 1992, pp. 146–147. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2385863.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42109">'''Housing discrimination''' is [[discrimination]] in which an individual or family is treated unequally when trying to buy, rent, lease, sell or finance a home based on certain characteristics, such as [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[Class (social)|class]], sex, [[religion]], [[nationality|national origin]], and familial status.&lt;ref&gt;"Laws Against Housing Discrimination". 2008. Accessed 20 November 2010. &lt;www.peoples-law.org&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This type of discrimination can lead to [[housing inequality|housing and spatial inequality]] and [[racial segregation]] which, in turn, can exacerbate wealth disparities between certain groups. In the [[United States]], housing discrimination began after the abolition of [[slavery]] as part of a federally sponsored law, but has since been made illegal; however, studies show that housing discrimination still exists.&lt;ref name="Shapiro, Thomas and Jessica Kenty-Drane 2005"&gt;Shapiro, Thomas and Jessica Kenty-Drane. 2005.

==History==
After the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, [[Jim Crow laws]] were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/what.htm|title=Jim Crow Museum: Origins of Jim Crow|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws led to the discrimination of racial and ethnic minorities, especially [[African American]]s. Fifteen state courts obeyed ordinances that enforced the denial of housing to African American and other minority groups in white-zoned areas. These ordinances were then made illegal in the 1917 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case, ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]''. Following this decision, however, nineteen states legally supported "covenants," or agreements, between property owners to not rent or sell any homes to racial or ethnic minorities. Although the covenants, too, were made illegal in 1948, they were still allowed to be present in private deeds.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Christopher (1997).

Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publ.. {{ISBN|0-8039-7233-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the Fair Housing Act, enacted as Title VIII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], that the federal government made its first concrete steps to deem all types of housing discrimination unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;"President Signs Civil Rights Bill; Pleads for Calm" New York Times, April 12, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; The act explicitly prohibits housing discrimination practices common at the time, including filtering information about a home's availability, [[racial steering]], [[blockbusting]], and [[redlining]].&lt;ref&gt;Yinger, John. 1998.

===Fair Housing Act===
{{main|Fair Housing Act (United States)}}
The [[Fair Housing Act]] was passed at the urging of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the federal Fair Housing Act (codified at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sup_01_42_10_45_20_I.html 42 U.S.C. 3601-3619], penalties for violation at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3631- 42 U.S.C. 3631]), Title VIII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], only one week after the [[assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]

The primary purpose of the Fair Housing Law of 1968 is to protect the buyer/renter of a dwelling from seller/landlord discrimination. Its primary prohibition makes it unlawful to refuse to sell, rent to, or negotiate with any person because of that person's inclusion in a [[protected class]].&lt;ref name=legal-dict&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fair+Housing+Act+of+1968 Definition of ''Fair Housing Act of 1968'' ], Legal Dictionary at TheFreeDictionary.com, Farlex Company. Accessed 15 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal is a unitary housing market in which a person's background (as opposed to financial resources) does not arbitrarily restrict access. Calls for open housing were issued early in the twentieth century, but it was not until after [[World War II]] that concerted efforts to achieve it were undertaken.

The Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968) introduced meaningful federal enforcement mechanisms. It outlawed:

* Refusal to sell or rent a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
* Discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin in the terms, conditions or privilege of the sale or rental of a dwelling.
*Advertising the sale or rental of a dwelling indicating preference of discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin.
*Coercing, threatening, intimidating, or interfering with a person's enjoyment or exercise of housing rights based on discriminatory reasons or retaliating against a person or organization that aids or encourages the exercise or enjoyment of fair housing rights.

When the Fair Housing Act was first enacted, it prohibited discrimination only on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.&lt;ref name=hud&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/progdesc/title8|title=Title VIII: Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity - HUD|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988, disability and familial status (the presence or anticipated presence of children under 18 in a household) were added (further codified in the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] of 1990).&lt;ref name=hud/&gt; In certain circumstances, the law allows limited exceptions for discrimination based on sex, religion, or familial status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.craigslist.org/about/FHA.html | title = Fair Housing is Everyone's Right! | publisher = Craigslist | accessdate = October 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] is the [[United States federal executive departments|federal executive department]] with the statutory authority to administer and enforce the Fair Housing Act. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has delegated fair housing enforcement and compliance activities to HUD's [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] (FHEO) and HUD's Office of General Counsel.  FHEO is one of the United States' largest federal civil rights agencies.  It has a staff of more than 600 people located in 54 offices around the United States. As of June 2014, the head of FHEO is Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Gustavo Velasquez, whose appointment was confirmed on June 19, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PN1349 — Gustavo Velasquez Aguilar|url=https://www.congress.gov/nomination/113th-congress/1349|website=Congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who believe they have experienced housing discrimination can file a complaint with FHEO at no charge. FHEO funds and has working agreements with many state and local governmental agencies where "substantially equivalent" fair housing laws are in place. Under these agreements, FHEO refers complaints to the state or locality where the alleged incident occurred, and those agencies investigate and process the case instead of FHEO.  This is known as FHEO's [[Fair Housing Assistance Program]] (or "[[FHAP]]").

There is also a network of private, non-profit fair housing advocacy organizations throughout the country.  Some are funded by FHEO's [[Fair Housing Initiatives Program]] (or "[[FHIP]]"), and some operate with private donations or grants from other sources.

Victims of housing discrimination need not go through HUD or any other governmental agency to pursue their rights, however. The Fair Housing Act confers jurisdiction to hear cases on federal district courts.  The [[United States Department of Justice]] also has jurisdiction to file cases on behalf of the United States where there is a pattern and practice of discrimination or where HUD has found discrimination in a case and either party elects to go to federal court instead of continuing in the HUD administrative process.

The Fair Housing Act applies to landlords renting or leasing space in their [[primary residence]] only if the residence contains living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by three or more other families living independently of each other, such as an owner-occupied rooming house.

====Enforcement====
The Fair Housing Act has been strengthened since its adoption in 1968, but enforcement continues to be a concern among housing advocates. According to a 2010 evaluation of Analysis of Impediments (AI) reports done by the Government Accountability Office, enforcement is particularly inconsistent across local jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=US Government Accountability Office|title=Housing and community grants: HUD needs to enhance its requirements and oversight of jurisdictions' fair housing plans|year=2010|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent developments===
The federal government has passed other initiatives in addition to the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]]. The [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act]] of 1974 and [[Community Reinvestment Act]] of 1977 helped with discrimination in mortgage lending and lenders' problems with credit needs.&lt;ref name="Justice"&gt;http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/hce/housing_coverage.php Department of Justice&lt;/ref&gt; The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 was passed to give the federal government the power to enforce the original Fair Housing Act to correct past problems with enforcement.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"&gt;Yinger, John. 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MVP_f-RPLWcC&amp;pg=PA499 “Housing Discrimination and Residential Segregation as Causes of Poverty,”] in Sheldon H. Danzinger and Robert H. Haveman, eds. Understanding Poverty. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, {{ISBN|0-674-00876-6}} pp. 382 ff&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment established a system of administrative law judges to hear cases brought to them by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] and to levy fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/FHLaws/yourrights|title=Fair Housing -- It's Your Right - HUD|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the relationship between housing discrimination cases and private agencies, the federal government passed the two initiatives. The Fair Housing Assistance Program of 1984 was passed to assist public agencies with processing complaints, and the Fair Housing Initiatives program of 1986 supported private and public fair housing agencies in their activities, such as auditing.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; Between 1990 and 2001 these two programs have resulted in over one thousand housing discrimination lawsuits and over $155 million in financial recovery.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; However, the lawsuits and financial recoveries generated from fair housing discrimination cases only scratches the surface of all instances of discrimination. Silverman and Patterson concluded that the underfunding and poor implementation of federal, state and local policies designed to address housing discrimination results in less than 1% of all instances of discrimination being addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Robert Mark and Patterson, Kelly L. 2012. "The Four Horsemen of the Fair Housing Apocalypse: A Critique of Fair Housing Policy in the USA." Critical Sociology 38(1): 123-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, they found that local nonprofits and administrators responsible for enforcing fair housing laws had a tendency to downplay discrimination based on family status and race when designing implementation strategies.&lt;ref&gt;	Patterson, Kelly L. and Robert Mark Silverman. 2011. "How Local Public Administrators, Nonprofit Providers and Elected Officials Perceive Impediments to Fair Housing in the Suburbs: An Analysis of Erie County, New York," Housing Policy Debate 21(1): 165-188.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Census]] has shown that ethnic and racial minorities living in concentrated, high-poverty areas had actually increased following the passage of the Fair Housing Act from 1970 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/ U.S. Census&lt;/ref&gt; African-Americans residing in these areas rose from 16 percent to 24 percent, and Hispanics living in these areas have increased from 10 percent to 15 percent.&lt;ref name="Massey, Douglas S 2004"&gt;Massey, Douglas S. 2004. "The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America," in C.Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy. New Haven: Yale University Press {{ISBN|0-300-09541-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this does not necessarily point to evidence of housing discrimination, it does mirror the phenomenon of white flight—the mass exodus during the 1970s and '80s of European-Americans from cities to the suburbs that left only one-fourth of the Anglo population still living in metropolitan areas. American sociologist [[Douglas Massey]], in his essay, "The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America", argues that this new racial geography in the United States has laid the foundation for housing discrimination to occur in order to keep up the status quo.&lt;ref name="Massey, Douglas S 2004"/&gt;

==Types==
Sociologists Vincent J. Roscigno, Diana L. Karafin, and Griff Tester have determined that the variety of actions that constitute housing discrimination can be classified as either exclusionary or nonexclusionary.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"&gt;Roscigno, Vincent J., Diana L. Karafin, and Griff Tester, 2009 [http://www.thecyberhood.net/documents/papers/roscigno09.pdf “The Complexities and Processes of Racial Housing Discrimination,”] Social Problems, Vol. 56, No. 1. University of California Press. pp.49-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusionary===
Exclusionary discrimination practices refer to "actions and practices that exclude an individual or family from obtaining the housing of their choosing." These forms of housing discrimination occur at various stages of the rental or sales process.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; The majority of discriminatory actors in exclusionary discrimination are landlords and landowners, as they have the positional power and direct access to the individual or family and the housing being sought. Other discriminatory actors or institutions responsible for exclusion include real estate, insurance, and banking and lending agents and institutions.&lt;ref name="South, S. J."&gt;South, S. J., &amp; Crowder, K. D. (1998). Housing discrimination and residential mobility: Impacts for blacks and whites. Population Research and Policy Review, 17(4), 369-369-387.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most exclusionary discrimination cases entail forms of outright exclusion, such as a direct refusal to rent to a prospective tenant, direct refusal to sell or discuss the sale of a property, or the false representation of homes or apartments available for sale or rent. Although this outright exclusion is often made up of subtle actions, like lying about standards for rental qualification to disqualify certain individuals, it sometimes also comes with overt verbal abuse and slurs.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

Other exclusionary cases entail discriminatory terms and conditions pertaining to the sale or rental of an apartment or home with the purpose of denying access. These forms include unfair financing or loan qualifications or terms, steering or restricting the choices of people seeking homes, differential criteria to qualify to rent a home, and refusing to provide insurance, which would prevent the individual or family from acquiring a home.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; Consumer advocate groups conducted studies and found that many minority borrowers who were eligible for affordable, traditional loans were often steered toward incredibly high-priced subprime loans that they would never be able to repay.&lt;ref name="Fair Lending and Accountability"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/opinion/fair-lending-and-accountability.html?scp=14&amp;sq=housing%20discrimination&amp;st=cse "Fair Lending and Accountability"] New York Times, September 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) found that "the greatest share of discrimination for Hispanic and African American home seekers can still be attributed to being told units are unavailable when they are available to non-Hispanic whites and being shown and told about less units than a comparable non-minority."&lt;ref name="HUD study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huduser.org/portal/publications/hsgfin/hds.html|title=Discrimination in Metropolitan Housing Markets: National Results from Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 of the Housing Discrimination Study (HDS) - HUD USER|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonexclusionary===
Nonexclusionary discrimination practices refer to "actions and practices that occur within an already established housing arrangement, most often entailing racial harassment, differential treatment of tenants, or disparate application of contractual terms and conditions of residency."&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;  Individuals and families already housed experience ongoing intimidation, differential treatment, and harassment, and nonexclusionary discrimination often results in distress for victims since the victim is often legally bound to the home and usually has direct contact with the perpetrator on a regular basis. Landlords and owners are still responsible for the majority of this type of housing discrimination, but neighbors and banking and lending institutions participate more. For instance, even without institutionalized exclusionary power, residential neighbors can harass and intimidate tenants.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

Most nonexclusionary discrimination cases involve applying discriminatory terms and conditions within the victim's current residential setting. The majority of these cases involve terms, conditions, and privileges relating to a current rental arrangement. These cases are often seen as unfairly raising the rent of a select group or allowing certain tenants privileges, like using a facility after hours or being lenient on pet policies.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; Many nonexclusionary discrimination cases involve the failure to provide equal access to services and facilities, such as purposely delaying or completely forgoing fixing a broken pipe. More terms and conditions cases involve discriminatory financing, loans, and appraisals of the individual or family's property, which is when the discriminatory actor takes advantage of the victim financially.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

Other forms of nonexclusionary discrimination include the use of harassment, intimidation, and coercion toward victims.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; This includes racial slurs and threats of violence, both of which create an uneasy environment in which the victims live.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawhelp.org/documents/871H-06%20Housing%20Discrimination.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These forms can cause excessive anxiety and stress for the individual or family affected. If an individual holding a position of an authority, such as the landlord, is responsible for the nonexclusionary discrimination, the victim is left with a feeling of powerlessness and lack of ability to get help.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

=== Disparate impact ===
Exclusionary and nonexclusionary describe the various disparate treatments that housing providers or agents can place upon renters and buyers. In addition to these types of housing discrimination, certain policies that do not discriminate on its face have also been found to cause housing discrimination in the United States. [[Disparate impact]] is a facially neutral housing policy that negatively impacts minorities or other protected groups of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/fcs/T6Manual7|title=Section VII- Proving Discrimination- Disparate Impact {{!}} CRT {{!}} Department of Justice|last=|first=|date=|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disparate impact was not always looked at in the housing context. It was first applied in housing discrimination in 2015 when the Court found Congress had intended to include liability for disparate impact discrimination in the Fair Housing Act and its recognition is consistent with the central purpose of the Act since it was amended in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2015/06/25/tdhcainclusiveopinion.pdf|title=Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.|last=|first=|date=|website=The United States Department of Justice|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that case, HUD began recognizing many types of disparate impact treatment. For example, HUD published a statement concluding that blanket prohibitions against tenants with criminal convictions would constitute disparate impact housing discrimination because incarceration rates in the United States are disproportionate between minorities and non-minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/HUD_OGCGUIDAPPFHASTANDCR.PDF|title=Office of General Counsel Guidance on Application of Fair Housing Act Standards to the Use of Criminal Records by Providers of Housing and Real Estate-Related Transactions|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|pages=3–4|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disparate impact remains controversial as some feel that their freedom in implementing policies and rules is now limited due to the fear of [[unintended consequences]] of rules that originally had no discriminatory intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/clegg_testimony_06_21_07.pdf|title=Testimony of Roger Clegg|last=|first=|date=|website=Committee on the Judiciary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Housing discrimination practices of today==
Professor of Public Administration and Economics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/jyinger/|title=John Yinger Professor of Public Administration and Economics|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expert in the field of housing discrimination studies, [[John Milton Yinger|John Yinger]], argues that discriminatory housing practices in the housing market have led to segregation and can be interpreted as forms of modern-day discrimination. One important example cited is of realtors opting to place [[Public Housing|public housing]] in crowded [[inner city]] minority neighborhoods instead of those with an Anglo majority due to "public and political pressure." &lt;ref&gt;Russell, Marcia C. 2008. Fair Housing. Dearborn: Real Estate Education Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Other housing phenomena that Yinger argues encourage segregation are those of [[sorting]] and [[bidding]] in which bidders perceived to be higher-class win out on cheaper per-square-foot, larger homes farther away from inner cities.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; The study done by the U.S. Housing Scholars adds that [[school zoning]] has also been named a culprit for housing segregation, and may be used as a critical venue for housing discrimination. It also cites the Internet as yet another means for the perpetuation of housing discrimination that is, as of now, unrestricted by the provisions of the Fair Housing Act. While the Fair Housing Act strictly prohibits any sellers from using language that explicitly names a preference for a certain group, third-party sellers that use sites like Craigslist.com and Roommates.com to find buyers or renters are granted immunity from the FHA, and the websites are not held liable. This was cemented by the 2004 court case, ''[[Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com, LLC]]'', in which Roommates.com was not held liable for users with advertisements such as, 'looking for White Christian Male,' since the website did not have the resources to monitor and censor such usage.&lt;ref name="prrac.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prrac.org/|title=PRRAC - Poverty &amp; Race Research Action Council|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT housing discrimination===
[[File:US LGBT housing discrimination.svg|thumb|350px|States that prohibit housing discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]]. [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] regulations require all housing providers that receive HUD funding not to discriminate against an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity.

{{legend|#0000ff|Prohibits housing discrimination based on sexual orientation only}}
{{legend|#d3d3d3|Does not factor sexual orientation or gender identity/unclear}}]]
Housing discrimination focuses more on race, but recent studies have shown a growing trend toward discrimination in the housing market against those who identify themselves as [[gay]], [[lesbian]], or [[transgender]]. Since housing discrimination based on sexual orientation was not explicitly cited in the Fair Housing Act, as of 2007, it was banned only in 17 states. In all states, same-sex couples are frequently unable to apply to public housing as a family unit, thus decreasing their chances at being accepted into the program.&lt;ref&gt;Cahil, Sean and Sarah Tobias. 2007. Policy Issues Affecting Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Families.

===Ethnic and racial minority housing discrimination===
Ethnic and racial minorities are impacted the most by housing discrimination. Exclusionary discrimination against African Americans most often occurs in rental markets and sales markets. Families are vulnerable to exclusion, but African American women are especially overrepresented as victims, especially single African American mothers. This discriminatory exclusion is because of stereotypes concerning race and single women. The presence of children in a minority family at times is what warrants the discrimination.&lt;ref name="South, S. J."/&gt; African Americans are also the victims in most nonexclusionary cases, with African American women still overrepresented. Nonexclusionary forms of discrimination such as racial slurs and intimidation affect many minority victims. Some racial minorities suffer the purposeful neglect of service needs, such as a landlord fixing a white tenant's bathtub quickly but delaying fixing the bathtub of the minority tenant.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; Data obtained by Ohio Civil Rights Commission studied housing discrimination cases between 1988 and 2003, and of the 2,176 cases filed, 1,741 were filed by African Americans.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; A study by HUD released in 2005 found that more and more Hispanics are facing discrimination in their housing searches.&lt;ref name="HUD study"/&gt; A 2011 article by HUD asserts that one out of five times, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders receive less favorable treatment than others when they seek housing.&lt;ref&gt;HUD Let's Put an End to Housing Discrimination http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/05/12/let-s-put-end-housing-discrimination May 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases brought to the Department of Justice show that municipalities and other local government entities violated the Fair Housing Act of 1968 when they denied African Americans housing, permits, and zoning changes, or steered them toward neighborhoods with a predominantly minority population.&lt;ref name="Justice"/&gt;

==Empirical evidence==
[[Quasi-experimental]] [[audit study|audit studies]], in which equally qualified individuals of different races both participate in housing searches, have found strong evidence of racial housing discrimination in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pager |first=Devah |last2=Shepherd |first2=Hana |date=2008-01-01 |title=The Sociology of Discrimination: Racial Discrimination in Employment, Housing, Credit, and Consumer Markets |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=34 |pages=181–209  |pmc=2915460 |pmid=20689680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
According to the U.S. Census of Population in 1990, 25.3 percent of all [[Non-Hispanic Whites|Anglo-Americans]] in the U.S. lived in central city areas. The percentage of [[African American]]s living in inner cities was 56.9 percent, and the percentage of inner city [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] was 51.5 percent. [[Asian American]]s living in central cities totaled 46.3 percent. According to a more recent U.S. Census Bureau study in 2002, the average white person living in a metropolitan area lives in a neighborhood that is 80 percent Anglo and seven percent black, while the average African American lives in a neighborhood that is 33 percent white and more than 51 percent black. As of 2000, 75 percent of all African Americans lived in highly segregated communities, making them the most segregated group in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on National Statistics. 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lWvi0mwqCb8C&amp;printsec=frontcover "Measuring Housing Discrimination in a National Study"]. Angela Williams Foster, Faith Mitchell, and Stephen E. Fienberg (eds.) Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press. Massey, Douglas S. 2004 {{ISBN|0-309-08325-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics do not necessarily point to evidence of housing discrimination, but rather to segregation based on historical reasons which have made ethnic and racial minorities more economically deprived, and thus prone to living in more poverty-stricken inner city areas.

===HUD study===
In a comprehensive study by the HUD in 2000, paired-tests (in which two applicants of different races but the same economic status and credit scores apply to rent or buy a house) were used to determine whether or not statistics about segregation truly pointed to housing discrimination. This study reported that although adverse treatment of racial and ethnic minorities has decreased over time, roughly 25 percent of white applicants were still favored above those who were African-American or Hispanic. About 17 percent of African American applicants and 20 percent of Hispanic applicants were subjected to adverse treatment, including receiving less information about a home or being shown fewer, lower-quality units.&lt;ref&gt;Galster, George and Stephen Ross and Margaret Turner and John Yinger, 2002 [http://www.urban.org/publications/410821.html "Discrimination in Metropolitan Housing Markets: National Results from Phase 1 of the Housing Discrimination Study (HDS),"] Working papers 2002–16. University of Connecticut: Department of Economics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of housing discrimination==
John Yinger, a sociologist who has studied housing discrimination, argues that it is something perhaps most concretely evidenced by its effects: [[concentrated poverty]]. People who suffer from housing discrimination often live in lower-quality housing. Housing inequalities often reflect the unequal distribution of income. Poor areas suffer from educational disparities, and a poor education translates into earnings disparities. Those who earn less can only afford lower-quality housing.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; Segregation, health risks, and wealth disparities all relate to poverty.&lt;ref name="Shapiro, Thomas and Jessica Kenty-Drane 2005"/&gt;

===Residential segregation===
Perhaps the most unmistakable consequence of housing discrimination is [[residential segregation]]. Housing discrimination helps reinforce residential segregation through [[mortgage discrimination]], redlining, and predatory lending practices. Racial avoidance and threats of violence also result in racial segregation.&lt;ref name= "Shapiro, Thomas and Jessica Kenty-Drane 2005"/&gt; Housing discrimination can also impact minority preferences over time, as individuals or families experiencing harassment and intimidation at their home on a daily basis may transition to more accepting neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

===Health===
Health risks are a consequence of housing discrimination. Those suffering housing discrimination and people living below the poverty threshold often rent small or low-quality housing. Lead paint left over from past years and animal pests, such as rats, can be found in older housing, resulting in serious health consequences. [[Lead poisoning|Lead]] can lead to lowered intelligence in children.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, JM (2007). "Burton's line in lead poisoning". European neurology 57 (2): 118–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Asthma is also a problem that comes with lower-quality housing, since more air pollution, dust, mold, and mildew are more likely to occur.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt;

===Neighborhood===
Neighborhood effects are also seen due to housing discrimination and residential segregation. The housing inequality that comes with living in lower-quality housing means that neighborhood amenities are lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Amartya K. 2004. "From Income Inequality to Economic Inequality," in C. Michael Henry (ed.) Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy, New Haven and London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Poorer areas offer worse education, leading to educational and employment disadvantages and a higher school dropout rate. Schools are often segregated due to the effects of housing discrimination and residential segregation, in turn hindering students' educational performance. A study conducted by the Century Foundation in Montgomery County, Md., showed that students from a low-income background enrolled in affluent schools did better than students in higher-poverty schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/opinion/22herbert.html?scp=10&amp;sq=housing%20discrimination&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Bob | last=Herbert | title=Separate and Unequal | date=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal activity, including gang life and drug abuse, is also more prevalent in poorer areas. The rate of teenage pregnancy has been shown to increase in these areas as well.&lt;ref name="Seitles, Marc"&gt;Seitles, Marc, 1996 [http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/landuse/Vol141/seit.htm “The Perpetuation of Racial Residential Segregation in America: Historical Discrimination, Modern Forms of Exclusion, and Inclusionary Remedies,”] Florida State University College of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wealth disparities===
Sociologists [[Thomas Shapiro]] and Jessica Kenty-Drane state that [[Wealth gap in the United States|wealth disparities]] are also a result of housing discrimination, as housing discrimination acts as a barrier to homeownership. Homeowners may learn management and home repair skills, and the children of homeowners are less likely to drop out of high school or to have children as teenagers. Additionally, credit constraints limit homeownership for people with low income. Housing discrimination that keeps families from affordable loans and nicer areas with increasing property values keep victims from accumulating wealth.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; Residential segregation also leads to generational wealth disparities. Children often inherit wealth from their parents, and if parents were forced into poor-quality housing because of housing discrimination, then there is less wealth to hand down.&lt;ref name= "Shapiro, Thomas and Jessica Kenty-Drane 2005"/&gt;

==Possible solutions==
Sociologist Douglas Massey argues that housing discrimination is a moving target.&lt;ref name="Massey, Douglas S 2004"/&gt; As federal legislation concerning anti-housing discrimination policies become more effective, new forms of housing discrimination have emerged to perpetuate residential segregation, and in turn, poverty.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

There have been a number of solutions proposed to finally end the threat of housing discrimination and eliminate any legal loopholes in which it may operate. So far fair housing enforcement of federal legislation concerning housing discrimination has faced challenges. The main burden of enforcement falls on federal financial regulatory institutions, like the Federal Reserve Board, and the HUD.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; The enforcement provisions of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 were limited, and even though the act was amended in 1988, there are still problems with enforcement since housing discrimination often happens one-on-one and is not very visible, even in audits.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; The Fair Housing Amendment Act of 1988 did make a system of administrative law judges to hear housing discrimination cases to help against the illegal actions. Other examples of federal legislation may include increased federal legislation enforcement, scattered-site housing,&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; or state and local enforcement on a more concentrated level.&lt;ref name="prrac.org"/&gt; Better methods of enforcement in addition to new policies are proposed to be a help. In 2010 the Justice Department under President Barack Obama made a new fair-lending unit.&lt;ref name="Fair Lending and Accountability"/&gt;

Inclusionary remedies to truly enforce [[Racial integration|integration]] are also proposed. Inclusionary housing refers to making sure that areas are integrated, and inclusionary housing increases chances for racial minorities to gain and sustain employment.&lt;ref name="Seitles, Marc"/&gt; Recently Montgomery County, Md., passed an ordinance to require new housing developments to consist of a percentage of moderately priced dwelling units, guaranteeing more affordable better housing for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Florence W. Roisman &amp; Hilary Botein, Housing Mobility and Life Opportunities, 27 CLEARINGHOUSE REV. 335, 348 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other proposed solutions include [[subsidies]], such as direct subsidies, project-based subsidies, household-based subsidies, and tax reductions.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; As of 2001, only 15.7 percent of poor households received federal housing subsidies, meaning a majority of people in poor households did not receive that help. Household-based subsidies have been a significant source of new housing assistance as of late.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; HUD has handed out housing certificates to allow participants of [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] to move into higher-quality housing units.&lt;ref name= "Yinger, John 2001"/&gt;

It is important to prioritize policy and city planning. Planning for sustainability does not come with a one-size fits all approach; wicked problems persist without clarity or solutions. However, looking beyond urban regimes and accepting the nexus of these regimes is the first step for change that planners can take. This can be done through the notion of Equitable Development, an approach that aims to create communities of opportunity. Inequalities oppressing low-income communities composed of diverse ethnicities are not only unethical but prove to be economically and environmentally unsustainable. Partnership between government, private sectors, and community-based organizations to manipulate public policy for the promotion of social equity, as well as, economic growth and environmental sustainability are crucial for justice.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Angela Glover. "Promoting Equitable Development." (n.d.): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:International Civil Rights Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|268px|The promenade as seen in 2012]]
The '''International Civil Rights Walk of Fame''', which honors some of the activists involved in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and others involved in [[civil rights]] activities, was created in 2004 and is located at the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site]] in [[Atlanta]]. It consists of a promenade that showcases the footstep impressions of those honored, marked in granite and bronze. According to the [[National Park Service]], which runs the historic site, the Walk of Fame was created "to give recognition to those courageous soldiers of justice who sacrificed and struggled to make equality a reality for all." Another motivation was to enhance the historic value of the area, enrich its cultural heritage, and make the site a better tourist attraction.

The Walk of Fame is the brainchild of [[Xernona Clayton Brady|Xernona Clayton]], founder and executive producer of the [[Trumpet Awards]]. She is a civil rights figure in her own right. Clayton said, "This is a lasting memorial to those whose contributions were testaments to the fact that human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. This historic site will serve as a symbol of pride and a beacon of hope for all future generations. We are looking forward to building a monument to the civil struggle that depicts every step taken toward the goal of justice and the tireless exertions and passionate concern of these dedicated individuals."{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

'''Jayne Cortez''' (May 10, 1934&lt;ref&gt;[[Margalit Fox|Fox, Margalit]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/arts/jayne-cortez-poet-and-performance-artist-dies-at-78.html?_r=0/ "Jayne Cortez, Jazz Poet, Dies at 78"], ''New York Times''. January 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; – December 28, 2012) was an [[African-American]] poet, activist, small press publisher and spoken-word performance artist&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/464 "Jayne Cortez"], poets.org&lt;/ref&gt; whose voice is celebrated for its political, surrealistic and dynamic innovations in lyricism and visceral sound. Her writing is part of the canon of the [[Black Arts Movement]]. She was married to jazz saxophonist [[Ornette Coleman]] (1954–64), and their son is jazz drummer [[Denardo Coleman]]. In 1975 Cortez married painter, sculptor, and printmaker [[Melvin Edwards]], and they lived in [[Dakar, Senegal]], and New York City.

==Biography==
Jayne Cortez was born Sallie Jayne Richardson on the Army base at [[Fort Huachuca, Arizona]], on May 10, 1934. Her father was a career soldier who would serve in both world wars; her mother was a secretary.

At the age of seven, she moved to [[Los Angeles]], where she grew up in the [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] district.&lt;ref name=Busby&gt;[[Margaret Busby|Busby, Margaret]], [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/04/jayne-cortez "Jayne Cortez obituary: Poet whose incantatory performances could be militant, lyrical and surreal"], ''[[The Guardian]]''. Friday, January 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Young Jayne Richardson reveled in the jazz and Latin recordings that her parents collected. She studied art, music and drama in high school and later attended [[Compton Community College]]. She took the surname Cortez, the maiden name of her maternal grandmother, early in her artistic career.

In 1954, Cortez married jazz saxophonist [[Ornette Coleman]] when she was 18 years old. Their son [[Denardo Coleman|Denardo]], born in 1956, began drumming with his father while still a child and devoted his adult life to collaborating with both parents in their respective careers.&lt;ref&gt;Rubien, David. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/26/DDK9SVDQB.DTL "Poet Jayne Cortez makes heady music with Ornette Coleman sidemen"], ''San Francisco Chronicle''. Friday, October 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Cortez divorced Coleman and founded the Watts Repertory Theater Company, of which she served as artistic director until 1970. Active in the struggle for [[Civil Rights]], she strongly advocated using art as a vehicle to push political causes, with her work being used to register black voters in Mississippi in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inquisitr.com/470070/jayne-cortez-dies-poet-and-activist-passes-away-at-78/ "Jayne Cortez Dies: Poet And Activist Passes Away At 78"], ''The Inquisitr''. January 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She traveled through Europe and Africa, and moved to New York City in 1967.

In 1969 her first collection, ''Pissstained Stairs and the Monkey Man's Wares'', was published and Cortez went on to become the author of 11 other books of poems, and performed her poetry with music on nine recordings. Most of her work was issued under the auspices of Bola Press, a publishing company she founded in 1971. She presented her work and ideas at universities, museums, and festivals in Africa, Asia, Europe, South America, the Caribbean and the United States. Her poems have been translated into 28 languages and widely published in anthologies, journals and magazines, including ''[[Postmodern American Poetry]]'', ''[[Daughters of Africa]]'', ''Poems for the Millennium'', ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]],'' and ''The Jazz Poetry Anthology.''

In 1975 she married sculptor, sculptor and printmaker [[Melvin Edwards]],&lt;ref&gt;Page, Yolanda Williams (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of African American Women Writers,'' vol. 1, Greenwood Press, 2007, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; and they lived in [[Dakar, Senegal]], and New York City. His work appeared in her publications as well as on some of her album covers.&lt;ref name=Busby /&gt; Cortez and Edwards she maintained two residences, one in New York City and one in Dakar, Senegal, which she said "really feels like home."

Cortez died of [[heart failure]] in Manhattan, New York, on December 28, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/05/jayne-cortez-dead-poet-performer-dies-age-78_n_2415854.html "Jayne Cortez Dead: Poet-Performer Dies At 78"], HuffPost Celebrity, January 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry and performance==
Jayne Cortez wrote and performed with an uncompromising intensity all her own. Acerbic, hard-hitting, unsentimental and scathingly honest, her take on reality is so potent – and even pungent – that many poets may seem benign, or even superficial, by comparison. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The musicians with whom Cortez aligned herself reflected the sociopolitical and cultural elements to which she attached the greatest importance. Born in Fort Huachuca, Arizona, in 1934, she grew up near Los Angeles under the spell of her parents' jazz and blues record collection, which also included examples of Latin American dance bands and field recordings of indigenous American music. Early exposure to the recordings of [[Bessie Smith]] instilled in Cortez a deeply etched sense of female identity, which, combined with a strong will, shaped her into an uncommonly outspoken individual. She became transformed by the sounds of [[Duke Ellington]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], and no-nonsense vocalist [[Dinah Washington]], whose visceral approach to self-expression clearly encouraged the poet not to pull any punches.

Cortez, who respected the memory of independent performing artist [[Josephine Baker]], preferred to name inspirations rather than influences, especially when discussing writers. Those with whom she identified included [[Langston Hughes]], [[Aimé Césaire]], [[Léon Damas]], [[Christopher Okigbo]], [[Henry Dumas]], [[Amiri Baraka]], and [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]. Parallels with the ugly/beautiful poetics of [[Federico García Lorca]] also suggest themselves. Her words were usually written, chanted, and spoken in rhythmic repetition that resembled the intricate, tactile language of African and Caribbean drumming.

Most of her work from the early 1970s onwards was issued by Bola Press, the publishing company she founded.&lt;ref name=Busby /&gt; She cut her first album, ''Celebrations and Solitudes'', at [[White Plains, New York]], in 1974. A set of duets with bassist [[Richard Davis (double bassist)|Richard Davis]], it was released on the [[Strata-East]] label. The first Bola Press recording, taped in October 1979, was called ''Unsubmissive Blues'' and included a piece "For the Brave Young Students in Soweto." Cortez delivered her poetry backed by an electro-funk modern jazz group called the Firespitters, built around a core of guitarist [[Bern Nix]], bassist Al McDowell, and drummer [[Denardo Coleman]]. For years, the Firespitters and Ornette Coleman's Prime Time coexisted with Denardo as the axis and various players participated in both units.

During the summer of 1982, Cortez delivered ''There It Is'', an earthshaking album containing several pieces that truly define her artistry. These include: "I See [[Chano Pozo]]," a joyously evocative salute to Dizzy Gillespie's legendary Cuban percussionist; a searing indictment of patriarchal violence called "If the Drum Is a Woman"; and, "US/Nigerian Relations," which consists of the sentence "They want the oil/but they don't want the people" chanted dervish-like over an escalating, electrified free jazz blowout. Recorded in 1986, her next album, ''Maintain Control'', is especially memorable for Ornette Coleman's profoundly emotive saxophone on "No Simple Explanations," the unsettling "Deadly Radiation Blues," and the harshly gyrating "Economic Love Song," which is another of her tantrum-like repetition rituals, this time built around the words "Military spending, huge profits and death." Among several subsequent albums ''Cheerful &amp; Optimistic'' (1994) stands out for the use of an African kora player and poignant currents of wistfulness during "Sacred Trees" and "I Wonder Who." Additionally, this album contains a convincing ode to anti-militarism in "War Devoted to War" and the close-to-the-marrow mini-manifestos "Samba Is Power" and "Find Your Own Voice." In 1996, her album ''Taking the Blues Back Home'' was released on Harmolodic/Verve; ''Borders of Disorderly Time'', which appeared in 2002, featured guest artists [[Bobby Bradford]], [[Ron Carter]], and [[James Blood Ulmer]].

She appeared on screen in the films ''Women in Jazz'' and ''[[Poetry in Motion (film)|Poetry in Motion]]'' by [[Ron Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181361/?ref_=tt_ov_dr "Jayne Cortez (1934–2012)"], IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her impact upon the development of spoken-word performance art during the late 20th century has yet to be intelligently recognized. In some ways her confrontational political outspokenness and dead-serious cathartic performance technique place Cortez in league with [[Judith Malina]] and [[The Living Theater]]. According to the online African-American Registry, " her ability to push the acceptable limits of expression to address issues of race, sex and homophobia place her in a category that few other women occupy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/total-expression-jayne-cortez "Total Expression Is Jayne Cortez"], African American Registry.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization of Women Writers of Africa==
In 1991, along with Ghanaian writer [[Ama Ata Aidoo]], Cortez co-founded the Organization of Women Writers of Africa (OWWA),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Organization-of-Women-Writers-of-Africa-Inc/186674931404222?fref=nf The Organization of Women Writers of Africa, Inc.] on Facebook.&lt;/ref&gt; and served as its president for many years thereafter, with board members including [[J. e. Franklin]], [[Cheryll Y. Greene]], [[Rashidah Ismaili]], and [[Louise Meriwether]], [[Maya Angelou]], Rosamond S. King, [[Margaret Busby]], [[Gabrielle Civil]], [[Alexis De Veaux]], LaTasha N. Diggs, Zetta Elliott, Donette Francis, [[Paula Giddings]], Renée Larrier, [[Tess Onwueme]], Coumba Touré, [[Maryse Condé]], [[Nancy Morejón]], and [[Sapphire (author)|Sapphire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcoyfitness.com/test/MEDIA/OWWA%201st%2020%20on%20stationery.pdf "OWWA’s First 20 Years"], Organization of Women Writers of Africa, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 OWAA organized "the first major international conference devoted to the evaluation and celebration of literature from around the world by women of African descent".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Lena, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/16/books/literary-women-with-roots-in-africa.html "Literary Women With Roots In Africa"], ''The New York Times'', October 16, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Cortez directed ''Yari Yari: Black Women Writers and the Future'' (1999), which documented panels, readings and performances held during that conference. She was also organizer of "Slave Routes: The Long Memory" (2000) and "Yari Yari Pamberi: Black Women Writers Dissecting Globalization" (2004), both international conferences held at [[New York University]].

Until shortly before her death Cortez had been planning an OWAA symposium of women writers to be held in [[Accra, Ghana]], which took place as scheduled, in her honour, May 16–19, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/poet-performer-jayne-cortez-dies-in-ny-at-age-78/article/2517664 "Poet-performer Jayne Cortez dies in NY at age 78"], ''[[The Washington Examiner]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10320">'''David James Wilkie''' (9 July 1949 – 30 November 1984) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] taxi driver who was killed during the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|miners' strike]] in the [[United Kingdom]], when two striking miners [[criminal rock throwing|dropped a concrete block]] from a footbridge onto his taxi whilst he was driving a strike-breaking miner to work. The attack caused a widespread revulsion at the extent of violence in the dispute. The two miners were convicted of [[murder]] but the charge was reduced to [[manslaughter]] on appeal, becoming a [[leading case]] on the issue of the difference between the two offences.

==Background==
David Wilkie was born on 9 July 1949.{{cn|date=September 2011}} He was working in [[Treforest]], [[Mid Glamorgan]] as a taxi driver, driving a [[Ford Cortina]] for City Centre Cars, based in [[Bute Street (Cardiff)|Bute Street]], Cardiff.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;Tim Jones, "Two miners charged with murder of taxi driver", ''The Times'', 1 December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; He was regularly engaged in driving non-striking miners to work, as the bitter industrial dispute had made them targets for physical retaliation by those miners who were on strike. The [[Merthyr Tydfil]] area was said to be the strongest in support of the strike of any mining area in Britain; it is situated in [[South Wales]], where a large percentage of Britain's remaining coalmines were situated.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;  There had not been much mass picketing in South Wales during the conflict, as there had been in many parts of England, because there had been so few strikebreakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Adeney |first1=Martin |last2=Lloyd |first2=John |date=1988 |title=The Miners' Strike 1984-5: Loss Without Limit |location=London |page=124 |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=0-7102-1371-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Killing==
On 30 November 1984, Wilkie's fare was David Williams, who lived in [[Rhymney]] and worked at the [[Merthyr Vale]] mine, six miles away. Wilkie was driving the same route as he had done for the previous ten days. He was accompanied by two police cars and a motorcycle outrider, and had just turned on to the [[A465 road]] north of Rhymney at the Rhymney Bridge roundabout, when two striking miners dropped a {{convert|46|lb|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="Trial"&gt;Tim Jones, "Miner's taxi driver killed in minutes by 46 lb concrete block, QC says", ''The Times'', 8 May 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; concrete block from a bridge 27 feet over the road. Wilkie died at the scene from multiple injuries; Williams escaped with minor injuries.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

==Reaction==
The incident led to a decrease in public support for the striking miners, and to an increase in the number of workers in other industries who crossed miners' picket lines (e.g. at power plants).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Adeney |first1=Martin |last2=Lloyd |first2=John |date=1988 |title=The Miners' Strike 1984-5: Loss Without Limit |location=London |pages=150–151 |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=0-7102-1371-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] said, "My reaction is one of anger at what this had done to a family of a person only doing his duty and taking someone to work who wanted to go to work." [[Kim Howells]], speaking for the South Wales [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]], blamed the attack on the attempts to persuade miners to return to work.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; [[Arthur Scargill]] said he had been "deeply shocked by the tragedy" of Wilkie's death.&lt;ref name="Scargill"&gt;"Scargill shocked by 'tragic death'", ''The Times'', 1 December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Labour Party leader [[Neil Kinnock]] was scheduled to appear at a Labour Party rally alongside Scargill in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] on the day of the tragedy.&lt;ref name="LWL294"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Adeney |first1=Martin |last2=Lloyd |first2=John |date=1988 |title=The Miners' Strike 1984-5: Loss Without Limit |location=London |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |page=294 |isbn=0-7102-1371-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kinnock's speech developed into an argument with some hecklers who saw him as having betrayed the NUM by failing to support the strike.&lt;ref name="LWL294"/&gt;  Kinnock began by saying, "We meet here tonight in the shadow of an outrage."&lt;ref name="LWL294"/&gt;  When interrupted, Kinnock accused the hecklers of "living like parasites off the struggle of the miners."&lt;ref name="LWL294"/&gt;  As Kinnock went on to denounce the lack of the ballot, the violence against strikebreakers and the tactical approach of Scargill, he was asked by hecklers what he had done for the striking miners.&lt;ref name="LWL295"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Adeney |first1=Martin |last2=Lloyd |first2=John |date=1988 |title=The Miners' Strike 1984-5: Loss Without Limit |location=London |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |page=295 |isbn=0-7102-1371-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kinnock shouted back, "Well, I was not telling them lies.

Wilkie lived with his fiancée Janice Reed, who was the mother of his two-year-old daughter and was pregnant with a baby who was born six weeks later. He also had a 12-year-old daughter and a five-year-old son by a previous partner.&lt;ref name="Victim"&gt;Tim Jones, "Unlikely killers in a bitter dispute", ''The Times'', 17 May 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Funds were opened to help the family; among the donors was philanthropist [[John Paul Getty, Jr.|Paul Getty]].&lt;ref name="Getty"&gt;"Dispute in the coalfields", ''The Times'', 19 December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roy Davies|Bishop of Llandaff]] led Wilkie's funeral service; he called for "some sort of moratorium" and a return to work by the miners in return for an impartial board to investigate conditions in the coal industry.&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;Tim Jones, "Bishop's plea as driver is buried", ''The Times'', 12 December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder trial==

The two men who caused Wilkie's death, Dean Hancock and Russell Shankland, were found guilty of murder by a majority verdict on 16 May 1985 (by which time the strike had ended) and sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name=OTDMay16&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/16/newsid_2512000/2512469.stm Miners jailed for pit strike murder], BBC News online (16 May 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Verdict"&gt;Tim Jones, "Miners get life for taxi murder", ''The Times'', 17 May 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; A third man, Anthony Williams, who had been present on the bridge but was found to have actively discouraged them from dropping the concrete block, was acquitted.&lt;ref name="Dismissed"&gt;Rupert Morris, "Welsh officials to meet over dismissed pitman", ''The Times'', 24 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The life sentences caused an outcry among the striking miners, who felt that the death of Wilkie was not a deliberate act; the strike had ended by the time the verdict was brought in, but 700 miners at Merthyr Vale walked out on hearing the news. A third miner, Dean Williams, was cleared of conspiracy to cause serious injury.&lt;ref name="Wildcat strike"&gt;Tim Jones, "Miners walk out over life terms", ''The Times'', 18 May 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell Shankland's solicitor was critical of Scargill's attitude. He referred to the strike as "a war" and said with regards to Scargill, "In that war there were generals, and they stood outside the law and they left Russell Shankland outside the law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/16/newsid_2512000/2512469.stm BBC on this day, 16 May 1985, Miners jailed for pit strike murder]&lt;/ref&gt;

On appeal, their convictions were reduced to manslaughter, and their life sentences were replaced with eight-year prison terms, of which they would serve just over half. The [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|Lord Lane]], explained that the crime would be murder if the death was a "natural consequence" of the miners' actions, but the legal phrase "natural consequence" was potentially misleading without further explanation.&lt;ref name="Appeal"&gt;Frances Gibb, "Miners win murder charge appeal", ''The Times'', 1 November 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal verdict of guilty to manslaughter was upheld in the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], in the case ''[[R v Hancock]]''.&lt;ref name="Lords"&gt;Frances Gibb, "Manslaughter verdicts are upheld on miners who killed taxi driver", ''The Times'', 13 December 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock and Shankland were released on 30 November 1989,&lt;ref name=OTDMay16/&gt; which was coincidentally the fifth anniversary of Wilkie's death.

==Aftermath==
[[Kim Howells]], the South Wales NUM official who commented on the killing of David Wilkie, later became a [[Member of Parliament]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and served as a minister in the [[Blair government]] and later became chair of the [[Intelligence and Security Committee]], a committee of parliamentarians that oversees the work of Britain's intelligence and security agencies. In 2004 he said that when he heard that a taxi driver had been killed, he thought "hang on, we've got all those records we've kept over in the NUM offices, there's all those maps on the wall, we're gonna get implicated in this". He then destroyed "everything", because he feared a police raid on the union offices.&lt;ref name="Destruction"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3435161.stm "Howells' strike papers admission – inquiry"], BBC News, 27 January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The killing is referenced in the [[Roger Waters]] songs , "Who Needs Information" and "Me or Him", on his 1984 ''[[Radio K.A.O.S.]]'' album.

The '''Looting of Battleford''' began at the end of  March, 1885, during the [[North-West Rebellion]], in the town of [[Battleford]], Saskatchewan, then a part of the Northwest Territories.

Within days of the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] victory at the [[Battle of Duck Lake]] on March 26, [[1885 in Canada|1885]]. [[Cree|Cree bands]] sympathetic to the Métis cause and with grievances of their own began raiding stores and farms in the western part of the [[District of Saskatchewan]] for  arms, ammunition and food supplies while civilians fled to the larger settlements and forts of the [[Districts of the Northwest Territories|North-West Territories]].

Prominent leaders of this uprising were Chief [[Poundmaker]] and Chief [[Big Bear]]. Poundmaker and his band had a [[Indian reserve|reserve]] near present-day [[Battle of Cut Knife|Cut Knife]] about 50&amp;nbsp;km (31 miles) west of Fort Battleford. Big Bear and his band had settled near [[Frog Lake Massacre|Frog Lake]] about 55&amp;nbsp;km (34 miles) northwest of [[Battle of Fort Pitt|Fort Pitt]] but had not yet selected a reserve site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Geography==
The District of Saskatchewan in 1885 was divided into three sub-districts and had a population of 10,595. To the east the Carrot River sub-district with 1,770 people remained quiet. The Prince Albert sub-district located in the centre of the district had a population of 5,373 which included the [[Southbranch Settlement|Southbranch settlements]] with about 1,300. The Southbranch settlements was the centre of [[Louis Riel]]'s [[Provisional Government of Saskatchewan|Provisional Government]] during the Rebellion. To the west where the Cree uprising led by Poundmaker and Big Bear occurred was the Battleford sub-district with 3,603 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Siege of Battleford==
[[File:Map of Battleford 1885.jpg|thumb|400px|Map of Battleford 1885]]
On March 28 as news that several [[First Nations|Indian bands]] including Poundmaker's were on their way to Battleford settlers began moving into the nearby [[North-West Mounted Police]] post, [[Fort Battleford]] which was under the command of Colonel Morris and 25 police. Over the next several days 500 civilians would take refuge within the [[palisade]]s. Many crossed over an unstable ice bridge on the Battle River leaving most of their possessions behind in the Old Town. During the night of March 29 nearby [[Homestead (buildings)|homesteads]] were raided their horses and cattle rounded up by the bands.&lt;ref name="looting battleford"/&gt;

Also on the trail to join Poundmaker in Battleford were the [[Mosquito-Grizzly Bear's Head-Lean Man|Assiniboine from the Eagle Hills]] approximately 30&amp;nbsp;km south of Battleford. On March 29 they killed their farm instructor John Payne and raided homesteads on the way killing a farmer by the name of Fremont.&lt;ref name="looting battleford"/&gt;

On March 30 Poundmaker asked for a meeting with the Indian agent J. M. Rae. 
After Rae refused to meet with him the combined Battleford bands took food and supplies from the abandoned stores and houses. The next day the bands camped a few miles away bringing with them their looted provisions including cattle and horses then eventually returned to Poundmaker's reserve.&lt;ref name="looting battleford"/&gt;
 
While the New Town was protected by its proximity to the Fort and its cannon the Old Town was not. Every day until the arrival of [[William Dillon Otter|Colonel Otter]]'s column on April 24 the occupants of the Fort watched as the Old Town about a mile away was plundered. Stolen vehicles and horses carried away the supplies of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and the other merchants. All the public buildings were sacked including the [[Battleford Industrial School]] (located in the Old Government House).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Historiographical interpretation==
The nature of the Cree advance on Battleford, like the entire 1885 Rebellion, is a source of [[historiographical]] controversy.  Historian [[Douglas Hill (historian)|Douglas Hill]] characterized the Cree group as a "war party&amp;nbsp;... ready to take revenge for a winter of incalculable suffering" who "swooped on Battleford, killing six whites". [[George F. G. Stanley]]'s writing on the subject indicated that the Cree were not murderous but more haphazard and bumbling: they "[did] not appear to have in mind an attack upon the town" but were content with "prowling around the neighbourhood".  While [[John L. Tobias]] says that the Crees tried to demonstrate their "peaceful intent" by including women and children in their group, simply took food to sustain themselves after finding the town abandoned, and then withdrew to avoid conflict with the police.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18999">[[Image:DiagFuncMacroSyst.pdf|thumb|350px|right|Example of a Macroeconomics Model]]
A '''macroeconomic model''' is an analytical tool designed to describe the operation of the [[economy]] of a country or a region. These models are usually designed to examine the dynamics of [[aggregate data|aggregate quantities]] such as the total amount of [[good (economics)|good]]s and services produced, total income earned, the level of employment of productive resources, and the [[price level|level of prices]].

Macroeconomic models may be logical, mathematical, and/or computational; the different types of macroeconomic models serve different purposes and have different advantages and disadvantages..&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, Olivier (2017), '''The need for different classes of macroeconomic models''', blog post, Jan. 12, 2017, Peterson Institute for International Economics.&lt;/ref&gt;  Macroeconomic models may be used to clarify and illustrate basic theoretical principles; they may be used to test, compare, and quantify different macroeconomic theories; they may be used to produce "what if" scenarios (usually to predict the effects of changes in [[Monetary policy|monetary]], [[fiscal policy|fiscal]], or other macroeconomic policies); and they may be used to generate economic [[forecasting|forecasts]]. Thus, macroeconomic models are widely used in academia, teaching and research, and are also widely used by international organizations, national governments and larger corporations, as well as by economics consultants and [[think tank]]s.

==Types==

===Simple theoretical models===
Simple textbook descriptions of the macroeconomy involving a small number of equations or diagrams are often called ‘models’.  Examples include the [[IS-LM model]] and [[Mundell–Fleming model]] of [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] macroeconomics, and the [[Neoclassical growth model|Solow model]] of [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] [[Economic growth|growth theory]].  These models share several features.  They are based on a few equations involving a few variables, which can often be explained with simple diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, Olivier (2000), ''Macroeconomics'', 2nd ed., Chap. 3.3, p. 47. Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-013306-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these models are [[Comparative statics|static]], but some are [[Dynamical system|dynamic]], describing the economy over many time periods.  The variables that appear in these models often represent macroeconomic aggregates (such as [[GDP]] or total [[employment]]) rather than individual choice variables, and while the equations relating these variables are intended to describe economic decisions, they are not usually derived directly by aggregating models of individual choices.  They are simple enough to be used as illustrations of theoretical points in introductory explanations of macroeconomic ideas; but therefore quantitative application to forecasting, testing, or policy evaluation is usually impossible without substantially augmenting the structure of the model.

===Empirical forecasting models===
{{main|Large-scale macroeconometric model}}
In the 1940s and 1950s, as governments began accumulating [[National income and product accounts|national income and product accounting]] data, economists set out to construct quantitative models to describe the dynamics observed in the data.&lt;ref name="kleinontinbergen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klein |first=Lawrence |year=2004 |title=The contribution of Jan Tinbergen to economic science |journal=De Economist |volume=152 |issue=2 |pages=155–157 |doi=10.1023/B:ECOT.0000023251.14849.4f }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These models estimated the relations between different macroeconomic variables using (mostly linear) [[time series analysis]].  Like the simpler theoretical models, these empirical models described relations between aggregate quantities, but many addressed a much finer level of detail (for example, studying the relations between output, employment, investment, and other variables in many different industries). Thus, these models grew to include hundreds or thousands of equations describing the evolution of hundreds or thousands of prices and quantities over time, making [[Computational economics|computers]] essential for their solution.  While the choice of which variables to include in each equation was partly guided by economic theory (for example, including past income as a determinant of consumption, as suggested by the theory of [[adaptive expectations]]), variable inclusion was mostly determined on purely empirical grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Measurement Without Theory |first=Tjalling C. |last=Koopmans |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |volume=29 |issue=3 |year=1947 |pages=161–172 |jstor=1928627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[economist]] [[Jan Tinbergen]] developed the first comprehensive national model, which he built for the [[Netherlands]] in 1936.  He later applied the same modeling structure to the economies of the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="kleinontinbergen"/&gt;  The first global macroeconomic model, [[Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates]]' [[Project LINK|LINK]] project, was initiated by [[Lawrence Klein]]. The model was cited in 1980 when Klein, like Tinbergen before him, won the [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize]].  Large-scale empirical models of this type, including the Wharton model, are still in use today, especially for forecasting purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Lawrence R. |editor-last=Klein |year=1991 |title=Comparative Performance of US Econometric Models |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-505772-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eckstein |first=Otto |year=1983 |title=The DRI Model of the US Economy |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-018972-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ronald |last=Bodkin |first2=Lawrence |last2=Klein |first3=Kanta |last3=Marwah |year=1991 |title=A History of Macroeconometric Model Building |location= |publisher=Edward Elgar |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Lucas critique of empirical forecasting models====
{{Main|Lucas critique}}

Econometric studies in the first part of the 20th century showed a negative correlation between inflation and unemployment called the [[Phillips curve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Phillips |first=A. W. |year=1958 |title=The relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of money wages in the United Kingdom 1861-1957 |journal=[[Economica]] |volume=25 |issue=100 |pages=283–299 |doi=10.2307/2550759}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical macroeconomic forecasting models, being based on roughly the same data, had similar implications: they suggested that unemployment could be permanently lowered by permanently increasing inflation.  However, in 1968, [[Milton Friedman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Friedman |first=Milton |year=1968 |title=The role of monetary policy |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=1–17 |jstor=1831652 |issn= |publisher=American Economic Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edmund Phelps]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |doi=10.1086/259438 |last=Phelps |first=Edmund S. |year=1968 |title=Money wage dynamics and labor market equilibrium |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=678–711 |url= |issn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that this apparent tradeoff was illusory.  They claimed that the historical relation between inflation and unemployment was due to the fact that past inflationary episodes had been largely unexpected.  They argued that if monetary authorities permanently raised the inflation rate, workers and firms would eventually come to understand this, at which point the economy would return to its previous, higher level of unemployment, but now with higher inflation too.  The [[1973–75 recession|stagflation of the 1970s]] appeared to bear out their prediction.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, Olivier (2000), op. cit., Ch. 28, p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]], published an influential paper arguing that the failure of the Phillips curve in the 1970s was just one example of a general problem with empirical forecasting models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |doi=10.1016/S0167-2231(76)80003-6 |last=Lucas |first=Robert E., Jr. |year=1976 |title=Econometric Policy Evaluation: A Critique |journal=Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy |volume=1 |issue= |pages=19–46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kevin D. |last=Hoover |chapter=Econometrics and the Analysis of Policy |pages=167–209 |title=The New Classical Macroeconomics |location=Oxford |publisher=Basil Blackwell |year=1988 |isbn=0-631-14605-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that such models are derived from observed relationships between various macroeconomic quantities over time, and that these relations differ depending on what macroeconomic policy regime is in place.  In the context of the Phillips curve, this means that the relation between inflation and unemployment observed in an economy where inflation has usually been low in the past would differ from the relation observed in an economy where inflation has been high.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, Olivier (2000), op. cit., Ch. 28, p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, this means one cannot predict the effects of a new policy regime using an empirical forecasting model based on data from previous periods when that policy regime was not in place.  Lucas argued that economists would remain unable to predict the effects of new policies unless they built models [[Microfoundations|based on economic fundamentals]] (like [[preferences]], [[production function|technology]], and [[budget constraint]]s) that should be unaffected by policy changes.

===Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models===
{{Main|Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium}}

Partly as a response to the [[Lucas critique]], economists of the 1980s and 1990s began to construct [[microfoundations|microfounded]]&lt;ref&gt;Edmund S. Phelps, ed., (1970), ''Microeconomic Foundations of Employment and Inflation Theory.'' New York, Norton and Co. {{ISBN|0-393-09326-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  macroeconomic models based on rational choice, which have come to be called '''dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)''' models.  These models begin by specifying the set of [[Agent (economics)|agents]] active in the economy, such as households, firms, and governments in one or more countries, as well as the [[preferences]], [[production function|technology]], and [[budget constraint]] of each one.  Each agent is assumed to make an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimal choice]], taking into account prices and the strategies of other agents, both in the current period and in the future.  Summing up the decisions of the different types of agents, it is possible to find the prices that equate supply with demand in every market.  Thus these models embody a type of [[Nash equilibrium|equilibrium]] self-consistency: agents choose optimally given the prices, while prices must be consistent with agents’ supplies and demands.

DSGE models often assume that all agents of a given type are identical (i.e. there is a ‘[[Representative agent|representative]] household’ and a ‘[[Representative agent|representative]] firm’) and can perform perfect calculations that forecast the future correctly on average (which is called [[rational expectations]]).  However, these are only simplifying assumptions, and are not essential for the DSGE methodology; many DSGE studies aim for greater realism by considering heterogeneous agents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Per Krusell |first=Per |last=Krusell |authorlink2=Anthony A. Smith, Jr. |first2=Anthony A., Jr. |last2=Smith |year=1998 |title=Income and wealth heterogeneity in the macroeconomy |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=106 |issue=5 |pages=243–277 |doi= 10.1086/250034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or various types of [[adaptive expectations]].&lt;ref&gt;George W. Evans and Seppo Honkapohja (2001), ''Learning and Expectations in Macroeconomics''. Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-04921-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Compared with empirical forecasting models, DSGE models typically have fewer variables and equations, mainly because DSGE models are harder to solve, even with the help of [[Computational economics|computers]].&lt;ref&gt;DeJong, D. N. with C. Dave (2007), ''Structural Macroeconometrics''. Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-12648-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Simple theoretical DSGE models, involving only a few variables, have been used to analyze the forces that drive [[business cycles]]; this empirical work has given rise to two main competing frameworks called the [[Real business cycles|real business cycle model]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kydland | first1 = Finn E. | authorlink = Finn E. Kydland | authorlink2 = Edward C. Prescott | last2 = Prescott | first2 = Edward C. | year = 1982 | title = Time to Build and Aggregate Fluctuations | url = | journal = Econometrica | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 1345–70 | doi=10.2307/1913386}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas F. Cooley]] (1995), ''Frontiers of Business Cycle Research''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Abel and Ben Bernanke (1995), ''Macroeconomics'', 2nd ed., Ch. 11.1, pp. 355-362. Addison-Wesley, {{ISBN|0-201-54392-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[New Keynesian economics|New Keynesian DSGE model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rotemberg |first=Julio J. |first2=Michael |last2=Woodford |year=1997 |title=An optimization-based econometric framework for the evaluation of monetary policy |journal=NBER Macroeconomics Annual |volume=12 |issue= |pages=297–346 |jstor=3585236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodford |first=Michael |year=2003 |title=Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-01049-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More elaborate DSGE models are used to predict the effects of changes in economic policy and evaluate their impact on [[Social welfare function|social welfare]].  However, [[economic forecasting]] is still largely based on more traditional empirical models, which are still widely believed to achieve greater accuracy in predicting the impact of economic disturbances over time.

====DSGE versus CGE models====
{{Main|Computable general equilibrium}}
A closely related methodology that pre-dates DSGE modeling is '''computable general equilibrium (CGE)''' modeling. Like DSGE models, CGE models are often [[microfoundations|microfounded]] on assumptions about preferences, technology, and budget constraints. However, CGE models focus mostly on long-run relationships, making them most suited to studying the long-run impact of permanent policies like the tax system or the openness of the economy to international trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shoven |first=John B. |first2=John |last2=Whalley |year=1972 |title=A general equilibrium calculation of the effects of differential taxation of income from capital in the US |journal=[[Journal of Public Economics]] |volume=1 |issue=3–4 |pages=281–321 |doi=10.1016/0047-2727(72)90009-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kehoe |first=Patrick J. |first2=Timothy J. |last2=Kehoe |year=1994 |title=A primer on static applied general equilibrium models |journal=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Quarterly Review |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=2–16 |url=http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/qr/qr1821.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; DSGE models instead emphasize the dynamics of the economy over time (often at a quarterly frequency), making them suited for studying business cycles and the cyclical effects of monetary and fiscal policy.

===Agent-based computational macroeconomic models===
{{Main|Agent-based computational economics}}

Another modeling methodology which has developed at the same time as DSGE models is '''Agent-based computational economics (ACE)''', which is a variety of [[Agent based model|Agent-based]] modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |first=Leigh |last=Tesfatsion |year=2003 |url=http://www.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/acewp1.pdf |title=Agent-Based Computational Economics |work=Iowa State University Economics Working Paper #1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the DSGE methodology, ACE seeks to break down aggregate macroeconomic relationships into microeconomic decisions of individual [[Agent (economics)|agents]]. ACE models also begin by defining the set of agents that make up the economy, and specify the types of interactions individual agents can have with each other or with the market as a whole. Instead of defining the [[preferences]] of those agents, ACE models often jump directly to specifying their [[Strategy (game theory)|strategies]]. Or sometimes, preferences are specified, together with an initial strategy and a learning rule whereby the strategy is adjusted according to its past success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=William |last=Brock |first2=Cars |last2=Hommes |year=1997 |title=A rational route to randomness |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=1059–1095 |jstor=2171879 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given these strategies, the interaction of large numbers of individual agents (who may be very heterogeneous) can be simulated on a computer, and then the aggregate, macroeconomic relationships that arise from those individual actions can be studied.

====Strengths and weaknesses of DSGE and ACE models====

DSGE and ACE models have different advantages and disadvantages due to their different underlying structures. DSGE models may exaggerate individual rationality and foresight, and understate the importance of heterogeneity, since the [[rational expectations]], [[representative agent]] case remains the simplest and thus the most common type of DSGE model to solve. Also, unlike ACE models, it may be difficult to study [[network effect|local interaction]]s between individual agents in DSGE models, which instead focus mostly on the way agents interact through aggregate prices.  On the other hand, ACE models may exaggerate errors in individual decision-making, since the strategies assumed in ACE models may be very far from optimal choices unless the modeler is very careful.  A related issue is that ACE models which start from [[Strategy (game theory)|strategies]] instead of [[preferences]] may remain vulnerable to the [[Lucas critique]]: a changed policy regime should generally give rise to changed strategies.

In the [[science]] of [[biology]], a '''mechanism''' is a system of causally interacting parts and processes that produce one or more effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mechanisms in Science|last1=Craver|first1=Carl |last2= Tabery|first2= James|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2017 Edition)|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientists]] explain [[phenomena]] by describing mechanisms that could produce the phenomena. For example, [[natural selection]] is a mechanism of [[biological evolution]]; other mechanisms of evolution include [[genetic drift]], [[mutation]], and [[gene flow]].   In [[ecology]], mechanisms such as [[predation]] and host-parasite interactions produce change in [[ecological systems]]. In practice, no description of a mechanism is ever complete because not all details of the parts and processes of a mechanism are fully known. For example, natural selection is a mechanism of evolution that includes countless, inter-individual interactions with other individuals, components, and processes of the environment in which natural selection operates.

==Characterizations/ definitions==
Many characterizations/definitions of '''mechanisms''' in the [[philosophy of science]]/biology have been provided in the past decades. For example, one influential characterization of neuro- and molecular biological mechanisms is as follows: mechanisms are entities and activities organized such that they are productive of regular changes from start to termination conditions (Peter Machamer, [[Lindley Darden]], &amp; [[Carl Craver]] 2000; 'MDC' hereafter). Other characterizations have been proposed by [[Stuart Glennan]] (1996, 2002), who articulates an interactionist account of mechanisms, and [[William Bechtel]] (1993, 2006), who emphasizes parts and operations (cf. MDC).

The MDC characterization is as follows: mechanisms are entities and activities organized such that they are productive of changes from start conditions to termination conditions. There are three distinguishable aspects of this characterization:

;Ontic aspect
:The ontic constituency of biological mechanisms includes entities and activities.{{examples|date=November 2014}} Thus, the MDC conception postulates a dualistic ontology of mechanisms, where entities are substantial components, and activities are reified components of mechanisms. This augmented ontology increases the explanatory power of the MDC conception.

;Descriptive aspect
:Most descriptions of mechanisms (as found in the scientific literature) include specifications of the entities and activities involved, as well as the start and termination conditions. {{examples|date=November 2014}}This aspect is mostly limited to linear mechanisms, which have relatively unambiguous beginning and end points between which they produce their phenomenon, although it may be possible to arbitrarily select such points in cyclical mechanisms (e.g., the [[Krebs cycle]]).

;Epistemic aspect
:Mechanisms are dynamic producers of phenomena. MDC emphasize activities, which are causes that are reified. {{examples|date=November 2014}}It is because of activities that the MDC conception of mechanisms is able to capture the dynamicity of mechanisms as they bring about a phenomenon.

==Analysis==
Mechanisms in science/biology have reappeared as a subject of philosophical [[analysis]] and discussion in the last several decades because of a variety of factors, many of which relate to metascientific issues such as [[explanation]] and [[Causality|causation]]. For example, the decline of Covering Law (CL) models of explanation, e.g., Hempel's [[deductive-nomological model]], has stimulated interest how mechanisms might play an explanatory role in certain domains of [[science]], especially higher-level disciplines such as biology (i.e., neurobiology, molecular biology, neuroscience, and so on). This is not just because of the philosophical problem of giving some account of what "laws of nature," which CL models encounter, but also the incontrovertible fact that most biological phenomena are not characterizable in nomological terms (i.e., in terms of lawful relationships). For example, protein biosynthesis does not occur according to any law, and therefore, on the DN model, no explanation for the biosynthesis phenomenon could be given.

==Explanations==
Mechanistic explanations come in many forms. [[Wesley Salmon]] proposed what he called the "ontic" conception of explanation, which states that explanations are mechanisms and causal processes ''in the world''. There are two such kinds of explanation: ''etiological'' and ''constitutive''. Salmon focused primarily on etiological explanation, with respect to which one explains some phenomenon ''P'' by identifying its causes (and, thus, locating it within the causal structure of the world). Constitutive (or componential) explanation, on the other hand, involves describing the components of a mechanism ''M'' that is productive of (or causes) ''P.'' Indeed, whereas (a) [[Noam Chomsky]] differentiates between descriptive and explanatory adequacy, where the former is defined as the adequacy of a theory to account for at least all the items in the domain (which need explaining), and the latter as the adequacy of a theory to account for no more than those domain items, and (b) past philosophies of science differentiate between descriptions of phenomena and explanations of those phenomena, in the non-ontic context of mechanism literature, descriptions and explanations seem to be identical. This is to say, to explain a mechanism ''M'' is to describe it (specify its components, as well as background, enabling, and so on, conditions that constitute, in the case of a linear mechanism, its "start conditions").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7914">'''Memorialization''' generally refers to the process of preserving memories of people or events. It can be a form of address or petition, or a ceremony of remembrance or commemoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

 | url =http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/memorialization
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | Memorialisation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorialization as a Human Right==
Memorialization is a universal need for both those being memorialized and those who are grieving. Although historically it was limited to the elite and only practiced in the highest societal classes, it is now almost considered a fundamental [[human right]] for all people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memorialized.com/ |title=Memorialized |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2002 |website=Memorialized.com |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorialization and Transitional Justice==
In the context of [[transitional justice]], memorialization is used to honor the victims of  human rights abuses.   Memorials can help governments reconcile tensions with victims by demonstrating respect and acknowledging the past. They can also help to establish a record of history, and to  prevent the recurrence of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/truth-and-memory |title=Truth and Memory |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ) |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorials can also be serious social and political forces in democracy-building efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |first1=Sebastian |last1=Brett |first2=Louis |last2=Bickford |first3=Liz |last3=Ševčenko |first4=Marcela |last4=Rios |date=2007  |title=Memorialization and Democracy: State Policy and Civic Action |url=http://ictj.org/publication/memorialization-and-democracy-state-policy-and-civic-action |publisher=International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) |format=PDF |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorials are also a form of [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]], or compensation efforts that seek to address past [[human rights violations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Memorials in Times of Transition|last = Buckley-Zistel, S. / Schäfer, S. (eds.)|first = |publisher = Intersentia|year = 2014|isbn = 9781780682112|location = Antwerp|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They aim to provide compensation for losses endured by victims of abuse, and remedy prior wrongdoing. They also publicly recognize that victims are entitled to redress and respect. The United Nations Basic Principles on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation  recognizes “commemorations and tributes to the victims” as a form of reparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

There are numerous  types of memorials used as [[transitional justice]] initiatives. These include architectural memorials, museums, and other commemorative events.  For instance, in northern [[Uganda]], monuments, annual prayer ceremonies, and a mass grave were created in response to the war conducted by and against the [[Lord’s Resistance Army]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

 | format     =PDF
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Museum of Memory and Human Rights]] in [[Chile]], which was created to document abuses by the former [[military dictatorship]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museodelamemoria.cl/el-museo/sobre-el-museo/ |title=Sobre el Museo |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=20 April 2012 |website=Museo de la Memoria y los Derechos Humanos |language=Spanish |access-date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges of Memorialization==
Memorialization can arouse controversy and present certain risks. In unstable political situations, memorials may increase desire for revenge and catalyze further violence. They are highly politicized processes that represent the will of those in power. They are thus difficult to shape, and international relief workers, [[Peacekeeping|peacekeepers]], and [[NGOs]] risk being drawn into disputes about the creation or maintenance of memorial sites. Yet they also have the potential to redress historical grievances and enable societies to progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5271">{{Platonism}}
'''Metaxy''' ({{lang-el|μεταξύ}}) is defined in [[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' via the character of the priestess [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] as the "in-between" or "middle ground".

==In Plato==
Diotima, tutoring [[Socrates]], uses the term to show how [[oral tradition]] can be perceived by different people in different ways. In the poem by Socrates she depicts [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] as not an extreme or purity;  rather, as a ''daemon'', Eros is in between the divine Gods and mankind.   Diotima thus exposes the flaws of oral tradition;  it uses strong contrasts to express truth, thus revealing vulnerability to [[sophism|sophistry]]. This portion of the dialogue points to the idea that reality is perceptible only through one's character (which includes one's desires and prejudices and one's limited understanding of logic). Man moves through the world of Becoming, the ever changing world of sensory perception, into the world of Being—the world of forms, absolutes and [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]. Man transcends his place in Becoming by [[Eros]], where man reaches the Highest Good, an intuitive and mystical state of consciousness. [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] like [[Plotinus]] later used the concept to express an [[ontological]] placement of Man between the Gods and animals.&lt;ref&gt;Rise and Decline of the Roman World By Hildegard Temporini, Wolfgang Haase
pg 706 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q0SynnxdVlYC&amp;pg=PA705&amp;lpg=PA705&amp;dq=plotinus+and+the+metaxy&amp;source=web&amp;ots=qFpZgwgrkV&amp;sig=M1XzvmdPVR2kVYXJ4M9Ok1msOiQ Text] Enneads 3, Verse 8 line 4 "But humanity, in reality, is poised midway between gods and beasts, and inclines now to the one order, now to the other; some men grow like to the divine, others to the brute, the greater number stand neutral."&lt;/ref&gt; Much like Diotima did in expressing that Eros as a ''daemon'' was in between the Gods and mankind. Love (''Eros'') is the thing in between or child of Poverty (''Penia'') and Possession (''Poros'').&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Symposium'' 203b-c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary use==
Contemporary [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] [[Eric Voegelin]] used the term to mean the permanent place where man is in-between two poles of existence. Such as the infinite ([[Apeiron (cosmology)|Apeiron]]) and the finite (the divine mind or [[Nous]]) reality of existence or between the beginning of existence (Apeiron) and the Beyond existence (ἐπέκεινα ''[[Transcendence (philosophy)|epekeina]]''). As a technical usage Voegelin defined Metaxy as the connection of the mind or [[nous]] to the material world and the reverse of the material world's connection to the mind as "consciousness of being". Under Voegelin it can also be interpreted to mean a form of perception in contrast to [[consciousness]] a template of the mind (or nous) in contrast to the dynamic and unordered flow of experiential consciousness. As a form of reflectiveness in-between two poles of experience (finite and the infinite or [[immanence|immanent]] and transcendent). The whole of existence being expressed as the [[cosmos]]. The Metaxy being man's connection to the material world this as the ground of being.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Voegelin, “Reason: The Classic Experience,” in Voegelin, Published Essays, 1966-1985, vol. 12 of The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin, ed. [[Ellis Sandoz]] (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1990), 289-90; Order and History, Volume IV: The Ecumenic Age, vol. 17 of The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin, ed. Michael Franz (Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press, 2000), 408.&lt;/ref&gt; Voegelin taught that those who sought political power for its own end were [[sophism|sophists]] and those who were seeking meaning and truth in life or union with the knowable and true, were [[philosophers]]. Each of these positions manifests a different view regarding Plato's becoming and being;  again the place in between each of these poles of experience is metaxy.

The concept is also used by [[Simone Weil]]. She believed that compassion must act in the area of metaxy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Athanasios Moulakis]], ''Simone Weil and the Politics of Self-denial'', University of Missouri Press, 1998, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''One-alarm''', '''two-alarm''', '''three-alarm fires''', etc., are categories of [[Conflagration|fire]]s indicating the level of response by local authorities. The term '''multiple-alarm''' is a quick way of indicating that a fire is severe and is difficult to [[Fire containment|contain]]. This system of classification is common in the [[Firefighting in the United States|United States]] and in [[Canada]] {{cn|date=November 2018}} among both [[fire department]]s and news agencies.

==Definition==
A common misconception is that a "3-alarm fire," for example, means that three firehouses responded to the fire. This is not the rule behind the naming convention, although some cities may use the number of firehouses responding for multi-alarm designations because that is the simplest way to determine an alarm number.&lt;ref name="Rochester3alarm"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2015/01/27/firefighters-battle-blaze-behind-memorial-art-gallery/22389473/ |title=Demolition of building near MAG to continue Wednesday |last=MacIntyre-Yee|work=[[Democrat &amp; Chronicle]] |first=Tina |date=January 27, 2015 |accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engber"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Engber|first1=Daniel|title=How Big Is a '10-Alarm Fire'?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2006/05/how_big_is_a_10alarm_fire.html|website=Slate|accessdate=15 November 2016|date=4 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely used formula for multi-alarm designation is based on the number of units ([[Fire apparatus|firetrucks]] for example) and [[firefighters]] responding to a fire; the more vehicles and firefighters responding, the higher the alarm designation. (Note: In most cities, a "unit" can be anything from a tanker or ladder truck to rescue vehicles to even cars driven by the chief and deputies.&lt;ref name="engber" /&gt;)

With this unit/firefighter alarm designation, the initial dispatch is referred to as a "first alarm" and is typically the largest. Subsequent alarms are calls for additional units, usually because the fire has grown and additional resources are needed to combat it, or that the incident is persisting long enough that firefighters on scene need to be relieved.&lt;ref name="nbc4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paying For Donated Blood, Ethanol In Lawn Mowers, Numbered Alarm Fires|url=http://www.nbc4.com/money/9208480/detail.html|website=NBC4.com|accessdate=15 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123185444/http://www.nbc4.com/money/9208480/detail.html|archivedate=23 November 2007|date=12 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Requests for units and firefighters from outside jurisdictions do not normally occur in multi-firehouse urban areas until elevated alarms are reached (alarm three and above), but will depend on the location of the incident and the condition of the authority having jurisdiction at the time of the incident.

==History==
The system of classification comes from the old tradition of using [[Fire alarm box|pull stations]] to alert the local departments to a fire in their area.&lt;ref name="engber" /&gt; The "box" would send a message to all local stations by telegraph that there was a fire, indicating the location as a number: (station area)-(box number), e.g., 2-11.&lt;ref name="engber" /&gt; Fires are still dispatched as "box alarms," following this tradition, with maps broken up into a grid of "box areas."

==Typical alarm levels==
Below is a list of the alarm levels used in the response policy of the [[New York City Fire Department]]. This is a basic example of how alarm levels are categorized in a fire department, how many fire apparatus or fire units  respond to each alarm level, etc. In New York, however, additional special alarm levels are utilized, aside from the conventional 1st alarm, 2nd alarm, 3rd alarm, etc. Examples of such alarm levels are the signal 10-75 assignment, the signals 10-76 and 10-77 assignments, and the signal 10-60 assignment. A 10-75 is a working fire (i.e., there is fire visible from a building), the 10-76/10-77 assignments are the alarm levels separate from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd alarms, etc. that are the standard fire department responses to fires in high-rise buildings. The signal 10-60 is a separate response to major disasters. 

Below is how alarm levels are categorized in order per protocol. Each apparatus count is in an addition per alarm (a five alarm assignment has 21 engine companies total). Each total is the total number of units on scene. &lt;ref name="fdny"&gt;{{cite web|title=FDNY Dispatch Policy|url=http://www.fdnewyork.com/aa.asp|website=FDNewYork.com|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1st alarm assignment / Box alarm assignment:
*3 [[Fire Engine|engine]] companies
*2 [[Fire truck|ladder]] companies
*1 battalion chief

1st alarm assignment / All hands box alarm assignment:
*4 engine companies 
*3 ladder Companies  (operating as firefighter assist and search team)
*2 battalion chiefs (one as a [[Firefighter assist and search team|FAST]] unit) 
*1 [[Squad truck|squad]] company 
*1 rescue company 
*1 division chief

2nd alarm assignment:
*8 engine companies 
*5 ladder companies 
*5 battalion chiefs
*1 rescue Company
*1 squad Company 
*1 deputy chief
*1 RAC unit
*1 satellite
*safety battalion
*SOC battalion
*1 tactical support unit
*field comm
*field comm battalion
*communications unit

3rd alarm assignment:
*12 engine companies 
*7 ladder companies 
*6 battalion chiefs
*1 rescue Company 
*1 squad Company 
*1 deputy chief
*1 RAC unit
*1 satellite
*safety battalion
*SOC battalion
*1 tactical support unit
*field communications units
*field comm battalion
*communications unit
*mask service unit
*Air Recon Chief (on Brooklyn box)

4th alarm assignment:
*16 engine companies 
*9 ladder companies 
*6 battalion chiefs
*1 rescue Company 
*1 squad Company 
*1 deputy chief
*1 RAC unit
*1 satellite
*1 safety battalion
*SOC battalion
*1 tactical support unit
*field comm
*field comm battalion
*communications unit
*mobile command unit
*planning section chief
*Air Recon Chief (on Brooklyn box)

5th alarm assignment: 
*20 engine companies 
*11 ladder companies 
*6 battalion chiefs
*1 rescue Company 
*1 squad Company 
*1 deputy chief
*1 RAC unit
*1 satellite
*safety battalion
*SOC battalion
*1 tactical support unit
*field comm
*field comm battalion
*communications unit
*mobile command unit
*planning section chief
*Air Recon Chief (on Brooklyn box)

If the incident commander decides that the incident does not require a higher alarm level to be requested, they can specially request an additional unit to the scene without requesting a full alarm level assignment. For example, at a working fire, there are four engine companies, three ladder companies, one squad company, one rescue company, two battalion chiefs, and one division chief operating at the scene. If the fire is not large enough to require a 2nd alarm, but there is a need for more equipment and manpower, the commanding chief can request additional units to respond "specially called" to the scene.

Thus, at the scene of a 5th alarm fire in New York, there are a total of 20 engine companies, 11 ladder companies, one squad company, one rescue company, six battalion chiefs, one division chief, one deputy chief, one assistant chief, and the chief of operations, as well as multiple specialized units and or specially called units operating on the scene.

All of these companies come from many firehouses to the scene. Some companies, however, are quartered together at the same firehouses. So, it is not a matter of how many firehouses respond to a fire, as popularly believed, but rather, how many companies/units and how many firefighters are operating on scene.

The '''National Urban League Young Professionals''' ('''NULYP'''),  is a [[National Urban League]] [[Volunteering|volunteer]], member, auxiliary that targets [[professional]]s ages 21–40 to empower their communities and change lives through the Urban League Movement.  Its current president is Carlos Clanton.
[[File:Google NULYP Logo.png|right|thumb|320x320px]]

==History==

In the late 1980s, several Urban League affiliates recognized the need to prepare a new generation of young leaders to take the mantle of [[leadership]] of the [[Civil rights in the United States|civil rights]] movement. Young [[African Americans|African American]] men and women, between the ages of 20-40, were invited to participate in and take an active leadership role in their local Affiliate Urban League programs and activities.

These auxiliary groups actively supported the Urban League movement by educating other young professionals about the movement, recruiting new members, volunteering, sponsoring educational initiatives like [[youth mentoring]] and [[tutor]]ing programs, coordinating [[Fundraising|fundraisers]] for [[scholarship]]s, and delivering [[Personal development|personal]] and [[professional development]] and networking opportunities to young professionals in their local communities.

As these auxiliaries began to grow, the Affiliate leadership took note of their success and began to ponder the power of a national movement of young professionals across the country.  Hugh Price, then president and CEO of the National Urban League, realized the need to make this potential national movement into a reality. He held a historic "Young Professionals Dialog Session" with over 200 [[young professional]]s in the [[New York metropolitan area|New York area]] in April 1998. This dialog session, in addition to a [[white paper]] submitted by Marcus Mitchell, ignited the spark that led to the formation of a [[working group]], tasked with establishing the framework and foundation for the National Urban League Young Professionals.
Under the direction of Annelle Lewis, senior vice president of affiliate development and programs, the working group again convened in [[New York City|New York]] in September 1998.

The National Urban League Young Professionals (NULYP) was unveiled at the 1999 National Urban League Annual Conference in [[Houston|Houston, TX]].  Marcus Mitchell assumed the role of president and under his leadership, the organization began to define itself and to carve out its role in the National Urban League movement. The leadership team met on regularly to refine the structure of the organization as well as to develop its first draft of by-laws. Soon thereafter, a special election was held to fill the open positions on the newly established NULYP executive board.

==Current status==
Today, there are over 62 chapters and 5,500 members supporting Urban League affiliate offices located in 35 states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].

In October 2014, the National Urban League Young Professionals announced a partnership with the Alabama Power Foundation to present the "LEAD [YP]" Conference, January 15–18, 2015 at the [[Birmingham–Jefferson Convention Complex|Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Center]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]].  It was designed to equip today's diverse [[Millennials]] and [[Generation X|Gen-Xers]] from across the [[United States|nation]] with training and tools to be leaders in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=NULYP Hosts "LEAD [YP] Conference: Preparing the Next Generation of Leaders |publisher=National Urban League Young Professionals |date=October 7, 2014 |url= http://www.prlog.org/12380240-nulyp-hosts-lead-yp-conference-preparing-the-next-generation-of-leaders.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hindu mythology]], the celestial ''Pārijāta tree'' is the tree of the universe which is owned by [[Shachi|Indrani]] and planted in ''[[svarga]]'' located between heaven and earth, which tree, also known as ''[[Kalpavriksha|Kalpa-taru]]'', is believed to yield all objects of desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sEIngqiKOugC&amp;pg=PA373&amp;dq=parijata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hqf-VNK-PIyeugTil4GwDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parijata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tree is identified with the Mandāra tree.

From the [[Bhagavata Purana]], the [[Vishnu Purana]] and the [[Mahabharata]] it is learnt that the elaborate process of ''[[Samudra manthan]]'' of primal waters of the cosmic ocean yielded the ''Pārijāta tree'' as one of the three valuables, this tree, said to have blossomed atop [[Mount Meru]] in the garden of paradise and identified with the Indian coral tree, was claimed by [[Indra]] no sooner it rose to the surface and emitted its fragrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Why the Parijata Tree came Down to Earth|author=Anita Nair|publisher=Penguin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XUQnAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT13&amp;dq=parijata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JKb-VI37OI6GuASI5YHICQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parijata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=the Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols|publisher=Serindia publications|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-3804Ud9-4IC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=parijata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JKb-VI37OI6GuASI5YHICQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parijata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Krishna]] is believed to have stolen the ''Pārijāta flower'' from Indra’s paradise to which act ''pārijāta-harana'' (removal of the ''Pārijāta tree'' from heaven), which has two forms in the [[Harivamsa]], relates; according to the ''[[puranas]]'', at the behest of his wife, [[Satyabhama]], Krishna had uprooted the ''pārijāta tree'' from the ''Nandana-vana'' of Indra and brought it to [[Dwarka]] though it has no role in rituals and is not associated with the world of humans, being merely a possession of sorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Festival of Indra|author=Michael Charles Baltutis|publisher=Proquest|pages=61, 78, 79, 82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SoEIwRq67iEC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=parijata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yKb-VIKMCcKSuAT0woKwBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parijata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hindu astrology]], the word, ''Pārijāta'', refers to a [[Raja yoga (Hindu astrology)|Rāja yoga]] based on the [[Planetary dispositors (Hindu astrology)|Planetary Dispositor Principle]].  This planetary combination called Pārijāta yoga arises if the lord of the sign occupied by the lord of the [[Lagna]] (Ascendant) and the lord of the sign occupied by the [[dispositor]] of the lord of the lagna both, or if the lords of the [[Navamsa (astrology)|navāmsas]] occupied by these two lords are situated in a ''kendra'' or a ''trikona'' from the ''lagna-kendra'' in their own or exaltation signs. [[Parasara]] states that the person blessed with [[Parijata yoga]] will be fond of battles, strong-willed, full of determination, fearless, adept and successful, kind-hearted, forgiving and generous, have faith in [[Dharma]] and [[Karmas]], a proud possessor and enjoyer of wealth and comforts and the one who leads a royal life during his or her middle and last part of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= [[Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra]] 2002 Ed.|publisher=Manoj Pocket Books|page=190|quote=Sloka 41&amp;42|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Three Hundred Important Combinations|author=B.V.Raman|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RAifaE52xPwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Parijata+Yoga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hbntUofTEuyM7Aa3i4CgCQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Parijata%20Yoga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pārijāta yoga is a combination of the Parvata yoga and the [[Kahala yoga]]. [[Gautama Buddha]] was blessed with this [[Yoga (Hindu astrology)|yoga]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1325">A '''plateau''' of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is a part of its [[domain of a function|domain]] where the function has constant value.

More formally, let ''U'', ''V'' be [[topological space]]s. A '''plateau''' for a  function ''f'': ''U'' → ''V'' is a [[path-connected]] set of points ''P'' of ''U'' such that for some ''y'' we have
:''f''&amp;nbsp;(''p'') = ''y''
for all ''p'' in ''P''.

==Examples==
Plateaus can be observed in mathematical models as well as natural systems. In nature, plateaus can be observed in physical, chemical and biological systems. An example of an observed plateau in the natural world is in the tabulation of biodiversity of life through time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4200">In mathematics, the '''Poincaré–Miranda theorem''' is a generalization of the [[intermediate value theorem]], from a single function in a single dimension, to {{mvar|n}} functions in {{mvar|n}} dimensions. It says as follows:

::Consider &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; continuous functions of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables, &lt;math&gt;f_1,\ldots, f_n&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that for each variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; is constantly negative when &lt;math&gt;x_i=-1&lt;/math&gt; and constantly positive when &lt;math&gt;x_i=1&lt;/math&gt;. Then there is a point in the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[cube]] &lt;math&gt;[-1,1]^n&lt;/math&gt; in which all functions are ''simultaneously'' equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

The theorem is named after [[Henri Poincaré]], who conjectured it in 1883, and [[Carlo Miranda]], who in 1940 showed that it is equivalent to the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Kulpa|1997|p=545}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intuitive description==
{{Plain image with caption|image=PoincareMiranda.png|caption=A graphical representation of Poincaré–Miranda theorem for {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;2}}|width=350px|align=right|caption position=bottom|triangle=triangle}}
The picture on the right shows an illustration of the Poincaré–Miranda theorem for {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;2}} functions. Consider a couple of functions {{math|(''f'',''g'')}} whose [[Domain of a function|domain of definition]] is the {{math|[-1,+1]{{sup|2}}}} square. The function {{mvar|f}} is negative on the left boundary and positive on the right boundary (green sides of the square), while the function {{mvar|g}} is negative on the lower boundary and positive on the upper boundary (red sides of the square). When we go from left to right along ''any'' path, we must go through a point in which {{mvar|f}} is {{math|0}}. Therefore, there must be a "wall" separating the left from the right, along which {{mvar|f}} is {{math|0}} (green curve inside the square). Similarly, there must be a "wall" separating the top from the bottom, along which {{mvar|g}} is {{math|0}} (red curve inside the square). These walls must intersect in a point in which both functions are {{math|0}} (blue point inside the square).

==Generalizations==
The simplest generalization, as a matter of fact a [[corollary]], of this theorem is the following one. 
For every variable {{math|''x{{sub|i}}''}}, let {{math|''a{{sub|i}}''}} be any value in the range
{{math|[sup{{sub|''x{{sub|i}}''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;0}}&amp;nbsp;''f{{sub|i}}'',&amp;nbsp;inf{{sub|''x{{sub|i}}''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;1}}&amp;nbsp;''f{{sub|i}}'']}}.
Then there is a point in the unit cube in which for all {{mvar|i}}: 
:&lt;math&gt;f_i=a_i&lt;/math&gt;.  

The this statement can be reduced to the original one by a simple [[translation of axes]],
:&lt;math&gt;x^\prime_i=x_i\qquad y^\prime_i=y_i-a_i\qquad \forall i\in\{1,\dots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*{{math|''x{{sub|i}}''}} are the [[coordinates]] in the domain of the function
*{{math|''y{{sub|i}}''}} are the coordinates in the [[codomain]] of the function

A '''principle''' is a concept or value that is a guide for behavior or evaluation. In [[law]], it is a [[Legal rule|rule]] that has to be or usually is to be followed, or can be desirably followed, or is an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in  nature or the way that a system is constructed. The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Alpa, Guido (1994) [http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/annlsurvey/vol1/iss1/2/ General Principles of Law], ''Annual Survey of International &amp; Comparative Law'', Vol. 1: Is. 1, Article 2. from [[Golden Gate University School of Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; A system may be explicitly based on and implemented from a document of principles as was done in IBM's [[IBM System/360 architecture|360/370]] ''Principles of Operation''.

Examples of principles are, [[entropy (disambiguation)|entropy]] in a number of fields, [[least action]] in physics, those in descriptive comprehensive and fundamental law: [[doctrine]]s or assumptions forming  normative rules of conduct, [[separation of church and state]] in statecraft, the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], [[wikt:fairness|fairness]] in ethics, etc.

In common English, it is a substantive and collective term referring to rule governance, the absence of which, being "unprincipled", is considered a character defect. It may also be used to declare that a reality has diverged from some ideal or norm as when something is said to be true only "in principle" but not in fact.

==As law==
===As moral law===
[[File:Socrates BM GR1973.03-27.16.jpg|thumb|[[Socrates]] preferred to face execution rather than betray his moral principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/socrates.html "The Ethics of Socrates."] ''Philosophy''.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;|upright=0.9]]
{{main|Ethics}}
A principle represents values that orient and rule the conduct of persons in a particular society.  To "act on principle" is to act in accordance with one's moral ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/jeff-flake-transcript-senate-speech.html "Full Transcript: Jeff Flake’s Speech on the Senate Floor."] ''New York Times''.  24 October 2017.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Principles are absorbed in childhood through a process of [[socialization]]. There is a presumption of liberty of individuals that is restrained.  Exemplary principles include [[First, do no harm]], the [[golden rule]] and the [[doctrine of the mean]].

===As a juridic law===
{{Main|Principle of legality}}
It represents a set of values that inspire the written norms that organize the life of a society submitting to the powers of an authority, generally the State. The law establishes a legal obligation, in a coercive way; it therefore acts as principle [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] of the action that limits the liberty of the individuals. See, for examples, the [[territorial principle]], [[homestead principle]], and [[precautionary principle]].

===As scientific law===
[[Archimedes principle]], relating buoyancy to the weight of displaced water, is an early example of a  [[law (principle)|law]] in science. Another early one developed by [[Malthus]] is the ''population principle'', now called the [[Malthusian principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Elwell, Frank W.  [http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/users/f/felwell/www/Theorists/Essays/Malthus1.htm "T. Robert Mathus's Principle ...."] ''Rogers State University''.  2013.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud also wrote on principles, especially the [[reality principle]] necessary to keep the id and [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] in check. Biologists use the [[principle of priority]] and [[principle of Binominal nomenclature]] for precision in naming [[species]]. There are many principles observed in physics, notably in [[cosmology]] which observes the [[mediocrity principle]], the [[anthropic principle]], the [[principle of relativity]] and the [[cosmological principle]]. Other well-known principles include the [[uncertainty principle]] in [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[pigeonhole principle]] and [[superposition principle]] in mathematics.

==As axiom or logical fundament==
===Principle of sufficient reason===
{{Main|Principle of sufficient reason}}
The principle states that every event has a rational explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/ "Principle of Sufficient Reason."] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.  7 September 2016.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following:

:For every entity ''x'', if ''x'' exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''x'' exists.
:For every event ''e'', if ''e'' occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''e'' occurs.
:For every proposition ''p'', if ''p'' is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''p'' is true.

However, one realizes that in every sentence there is a direct relation between the predicate and the subject. To say that "the Earth is round", corresponds to a direct relation between the subject and the predicate.

===Principle of non-contradiction===
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Portrait bust]] of Aristotle; an [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] copy of a lost [[bronze sculpture]] made by [[Lysippos]]]]
{{Main|Law of noncontradiction}}
According to [[Aristotle]], “It is impossible for the same thing to belong and not to belong at the same time to the same thing and in the same respect.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-noncontradiction/ "Aristotle on Non-contradiction."] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.  12 June 2015.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is not possible that in exactly the same moment and place, it rains and doesn't rain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Aristotle/aristotle_laws_of_thought.html "Great Philosophers."] ''Oregon State University''.  2002.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle of excluded middle===
{{Main|Law of excluded middle}}
The principle of the excluding third or "principium tertium exclusum" is a principle of the traditional logic formulated canonically by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] as: either ''A'' is ''B'' or ''A'' isn't ''B''. It is read the following way: either ''P'' is true, or its denial ¬''P'' is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/AAT3201.0001.001|title=Principia mathematica, by Alfred North Whitehead ... and Bertrand Russell.|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also known as "''tertium non datur''" ('A third (thing) is not). Classically it is considered to be one of the most important fundamental principles or laws of thought (along with the principles of identity, no contradiction and sufficient reason).

'''Punctuality''' is the characteristic of being able to complete a required task or fulfill an obligation before or at a previously designated time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/punctual |title=Punctual - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Punctual" is often used [[synonym]]ously with "on time". 
It is also acceptable that punctual can also, be related to talking about grammar, means "to be accurate".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

An opposite personality trait is [[tardiness (vice)|tardiness]].

According to each culture, there is often an understanding about what is considered an acceptable degree of punctuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/11/travel/tr-insider11 |title=Punctuality: Some cultures are wound tighter than others - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1994-12-30 |accessdate=2014-02-01 |first=Jane |last=Engle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, a small amount of lateness is acceptable; this is commonly about ten or fifteen minutes in Western cultures, but this is not the case in such instances as doctor's appointments or school lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/germans-and-punctuality/a-16430264 |title=Germans and punctuality &amp;#124; All about those Germans &amp;#124; DW.DE &amp;#124; 09.12.2012 |publisher=DW.DE |date= |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, such as [[Japanese society]], and settings, such as military ones, expectations may be much stricter.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Some cultures have an unspoken understanding that actual deadlines are different from stated deadlines, for example with [[Africa time]]. For example, it may be understood in a particular culture that people will turn up an hour later than advertised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White |first=Lawrence T. |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/culture-conscious/201202/is-punctuality-standard-oxymoron |title=Is "Punctuality Standard" an Oxymoron? |publisher=Psychology Today |date=2012-02-23 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, since everyone understands that a 9 pm party will actually start at around 10 pm, no-one is inconvenienced when everyone arrives at 10 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3211923.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Can Africa keep time? |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-10-28 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultures which value punctuality, being late is seen as disrespectful of others' time and may be considered insulting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/788640.shtml |title=Time for Africa to abandon tardy culture to avoid punctuality problems - OP-ED |publisher=Globaltimes.cn |date=2013-06-13 |accessdate=2014-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113154030/http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/788640.shtml |archivedate=2014-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, punctuality may be enforced by social penalties, for example by excluding low-status latecomers from meetings entirely. Such considerations can lead on to considering the value of punctuality in [[econometrics]] and to considering the effects of non-punctuality on others in [[queueing theory]].

'''Repetition compulsion''' is a psychological phenomenon in which a person repeats a [[Psychological trauma|traumatic event]] or its circumstances over and over again. This includes reenacting the event or putting oneself in situations where the event is likely to happen again. This "re-living" can also take the form of [[dream]]s in which memories and feelings of what happened are repeated, and even [[hallucination]].

The term can also be used to cover the repetition of behaviour or life patterns more broadly: a "key component in Freud's understanding of mental life, 'repetition compulsion' ... describes the pattern whereby people endlessly repeat patterns of behaviour which were difficult or distressing in earlier life".&lt;ref&gt;Jan Clark and Jim Crawley, ''Transference and Projection: Mirrors to the self.'' (Buckingham 2002). p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud==
[[Sigmund Freud]]'s use of the concept of "repetition compulsion" ({{lang-de|Wiederholungszwang}})&lt;ref name="LP"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Laplanche |first2=Jean-Bertrand |last2=Pontalis |authorlink1=Jean Laplanche |authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis |title=The Language of Psycho-analysis |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |chapter=Compulsion to Repeat (Repetition Compulsion) (pp. 78-80) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=%22Compulsion+to+Repeat+(Repetition+Compulsion)+=+D.:+Wiederholungszwang%22 |publisher=Karnac Books |location=London |year=1988 |edition=reprint, revised |origyear=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tV99AAAAMAAJ 1973] |isbn=978-0-946-43949-2 |id={{ISBN|0-94643949-4}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; was 'articulated ... for the first time, in the article of 1914, ''Erinnern, Wiederholen und Durcharbeiten'' ("Remembering, Repeating and Working-Through")'.&lt;ref name="LP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lacan |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Lacan |editor-last=Miller |editor-first=Jacques-Alain |editor-link=Jacques-Alain Miller |others=Translated from the 1973 French original by [[Alan Sheridan]] |title=[[The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis]] |year=2018 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=5guFfqA6l0UC&amp;pg=PT2&amp;dq=1977 1977] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |isbn=978-0-429-90659-6 |id={{ISBN|0-42990659-5}} |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=z0ZaDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=%22he+articulated+it+for+the+first+time,+in+the+article+of+1914,+Erinnern,+Wiederholen+und+Durcharbeiten%22%22(Remembering,+Repeating+and+Working-Through%22 49]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he noted how 'the patient does not ''remember'' anything of what he has forgotten and repressed, he ''acts'' it out, without, of course, knowing that he is repeating it ... For instance, the patient does not say that he remembers that he used to be defiant and critical toward his parents' authority; instead, he behaves in that way to the doctor'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, quoted in Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988). p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

He explored the repetition compulsion further in his 1920 essay ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', describing four aspects of repetitive behavior, all of which seemed odd to him from the point of view of the mind's quest for pleasure/avoidance of unpleasure.

The first was the way 'dreams occurring in traumatic neuroses have the characteristic of repeatedly bringing the patient back into the situation of his accident' rather than, for example, 'show[ing] the patient pictures from his healthy past'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'' in ''On Metapsychology'' (Middlesex 1987). pp. 282-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second came from children's [[Play (activity)|play]]. Freud reported observing a [[child]] throw his favorite toy from his crib, become upset at the loss, then reel the toy back in, only to repeat this action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=|first= |title=Literary Encyclopedia: Repetition Compulsion |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&amp;UID=947 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud theorized that the child was attempting to master the sensation of loss 'in allowing his mother to go away without protesting', but asked in puzzlement 'How then does his repetition of this distressing experience as a game fit in with the pleasure principle?'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third was the way (noted in 1914) that the patient, exploring in therapy a repressed past, 'is obliged to ''repeat'' the repressed material as a contemporary experience instead of ... ''remembering'' it as something belonging to the past ... the compulsion to repeat the events of his childhood in the transference evidently disregards the pleasure principle in ''every'' way'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. pp. 288, 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth was the so-called "destiny neurosis", manifested in 'the life-histories of men and women ... [as] an essential character-trait which remains always the same and which is compelled to find expression in a repetition of the same experience'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

All such activities appeared to Freud to contradict the organism's search for pleasure, and therefore 'to justify the hypothesis of a compulsion to repeat—something that seems more primitive, more elementary, more instinctual than the pleasure principle which it over-rides':&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; 'a daemonic current/trait',&lt;ref name="Penguin" &gt;{{cite book |title=Beyond the Pleasure Principle |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LQcUz3FVkNQC&amp;q=daemonic |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=London |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-141-93166-1 |id={{ISBN|0-14193166-3}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/276/ ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle''] (C.

Following this line of thought, he would come to stress that '''an instinct is an urge inherent in organic life to restore an earlier state of things''&lt;nowiki/&gt;';&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; and so to arrive eventually at his concept of the [[death drive]].

Along the way, however, Freud had in addition considered a variety of more purely psychological explanations for the phenomena of the repetition compulsion which he had observed. Traumatic repetitions could be seen as the result of an attempt to retrospectively "master" the original trauma, a child's play as an attempt to turn passivity into activity: 'At the outset he was in a ''passive'' situation ... but by repeating it, unpleasurable though it was, as a game, he took on an ''active'' part'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the repetition of unpleasant experiences in analysis could be considered 'unpleasure for one system {{bracket|[[Id, ego and super-ego|the ego]]}} and simultaneously satisfaction for the other {{bracket|[[Id, ego and super-ego|the id]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second edition of 1921, he extended the point, stating explicitly that transference repetitions 'are of course the activities of instincts intended to lead to satisfaction; but no lesson has been learnt from the old experience of these activities having led only to unpleasure'.&lt;ref name="Freud, Beyond p. 292"/&gt;

Five years later, in ''Inhibition, Symptom and Anxiety'', he would quietly revise his earlier definition—'There is no need to be discouraged by these emendations ... so long as they enrich rather than invalidate our earlier views'—in his new formula on 'the power of the compulsion to repeat—the attraction exerted by the unconscious prototypes upon the repressed instinctual process'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (Middlesex 1987). p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later psychoanalytic developments==
It was in the latter, psychological form that the concept of the repetition compulsion passed into the psychoanalytic mainstream. [[Otto Fenichel]] in his "second generation" compendium ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' stressed two main kinds of neurotic repetition.

On the one hand, there were '''Repetitions of traumatic events for the purpose of achieving a belated mastery'' ... seen first and most clearly in children's games',&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946). p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt; although the 'same pattern occurs in the repetitive dreams and symptoms of traumatic neurotics and in many similar little actions of normal persons who ... repeat upsetting experiences a number of times before these experiences are mastered.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Neurosis''. p. 543.&lt;/ref&gt; Such traumatic repetitions could themselves appear in active or passive forms. In a passive form, one chooses his or her most familiar experiences consistently as a means to deal with problems of the past, believing that new experiences will be more painful than their present situation or too new and untested to imagine. In the active, participatory form, a person actively engages in behavior that mimics an earlier stressor, either deliberately or unconsciously, so that in particular events that are terrifying in childhood become sources of attraction in adulthood. For instance, a person who was spanked as a child may incorporate this into their adult sexual practices; or a victim of sexual abuse may attempt to seduce another person of authority in his or her life (such as their boss or therapist): an attempt at ''mastery'' of their feelings and experience, in the sense that they unconsciously want to go through the same situation but that it ''not'' result negatively as it did in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last =| first =| title =Roberta Satow - Psychoanalyst| url =http://www.robertasatow.com/psych.html| publisher =| date =| accessdate =6 July 2010| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100117153938/http://www.robertasatow.com/psych.html| archivedate =17 January 2010| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there were '''Repetitions due to the tendency of the repressed to find an outlet''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'.&lt;ref name="Fenichel, Neurosis p. 542"&gt;Fenichel, ''Neurosis''. p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt; Here the drive of the repressed impulse to find gratification brought with it a renewal of the original defence: 'the anxiety that first brought about the repression is mobilized again and creates, together with the repetition of the impulse, a repetition of the anti-instinctual measures'.&lt;ref name="Fenichel, Neurosis p. 542"/&gt; Fenichel considered that 'Neurotic repetitions of this kind contain no metaphysical element', and 'even the repetition of the most painful failure of the Oedipus complex in the transference during a psychoanalytic cure is not "beyond the pleasure principle"'.&lt;ref name="Fenichel, Neurosis p. 542"/&gt;

Later writers would take very similar views. [[Eric Berne]] saw as central to his work 'the repetition compulsion which drives men to their doom, the power of death, according to Freud ... [who] places it in some mysterious biological sphere, when after all it is only the voice of seduction'&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say after You Say Hello?'' (London 1975). p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;—the seduction of the repressed and unconscious id.

[[Erik Erikson]] saw the destiny neurosis—the way 'that some people make the same mistakes over and over'—in the same light: 'the individual unconsciously arranges for variations of an original theme which he has not learned either to overcome or to live with'.&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, ''[[Childhood and Society]]'' (Middlesex 1973). p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ego psychology]] would subsequently take for granted 'how rigidly determined our lives are—how predictable and repetitive ... the same mistake over and over again'.&lt;ref&gt;"Aaron Green" in Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988). p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Object relations theory]], stressing the way 'the transference is a live relationship ... in the here-and-now of the analysis, repeating the way that the patient has used his objects from early in life' considered that 'this newer conception reveals a purpose ... [in] the repetition compulsion':&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006). pp. 149, 176.&lt;/ref&gt; thus 'unconscious hope may be found in repetition compulsion, when unresolved conflicts continue to generate attempts at solutions which do not really work ... [until] a genuine solution is found'.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1997). p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodern formulations==
By the close of the twentieth century, the psychoanalytic view of repetition compulsion had come into increasing dialogue with a variety of other discourses, ranging from [[attachment theory]] through brief psychodynamic therapy to [[cognitive behavioural therapy]].

Attachment theory saw early developmental experiences leading to 'schemas or mental representations of relationship ... [which] become organized, encoded experiential and cognitive data ... that lead to self-confirmation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grant |first1=Jan |last2=Crawley |first2=Jim |title=Transference and Projection |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hIREBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2002 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]] |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-335-20314-7 |id={{ISBN|0-33523164-0}} |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=hIREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=%22schemas+or+mental+representations+of+relationship%22%22become+organized,+encoded+experiential+and+cognitive+data%22%22that+lead+to+self-confirmation%22 2]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Core Conflictual Relationship Theme]]—'core wishes that the individual has in relation to others'—was seen in brief psychodynamic therapy as linked to the way in 'a repetition compulsion, the client will behave in ways that engender particular responses from others that conform with previous experiences in interpersonal relationships'.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Jan; Crawley, Jim (2002). p. [https://books.google.com/?id=hIREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22core+wishes+that+the+individual+has+in+relation+to+others%22%22a+repetition+compulsion,+the+client+will+behave+in+ways+that+engender+particular+responses+from+others+that+conform+with+previous+experiences+in+interpersonal+relationships%22 59].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 'psychological schemas' described in social psychology or cognitive-behavioural psychology ... 'an enduring symbolic framework that organizes constellations of thought, feeling, memory, and expectation about self and others" (Knapp 1991: 94)',&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Jan; Crawley, Jim (2002). p. [https://books.google.com/?id=hIREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22an+enduring+symbolic+framework+that+organizes+constellations+of+thought,+feeling,+memory,+and+expectation+about+self+and+others'+(Knapp+1991:+94)%22 5].&lt;/ref&gt; further parallels may be seen to the role of early unconscious fixations in fueling the repetition compulsion.

A '''reverse vending machine''' is a device that accepts used (empty) [[beverage containers]] and returns money to the user. The machines are popular in places that have mandatory [[recycling]] laws or [[container deposit legislation]]. In some places, bottlers paid funds into a centralized pool to be disbursed to people who recycled the containers.  Any excess funds were to be used for general environmental cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bottlebill.com/ |title=Bottle Bill Resource Guide |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=bottlebill.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, such as [[Norway]], the state mandated that a vendor pay for recycled bottles, but left the system in the hands of private industry.

==Operation==
[[File:Pantemaskin.webm|thumb|Video clip showing a reverse vending machine in Norway.]]
The recycler places the empty bottle or can into the receiving aperture; the horizontal in-feed system allows the user to insert containers one at a time. (An alternative system, found in many older machines, is one in which the user opens a door by hand and places the empty container in a pan. When the door is released and closed, the process continues.) The bottle or can is then automatically rotated; the bottle/can is then scanned by an omnidirectional [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] scanner, which scans the beverage container's [[Universal Product Code|UPC]].		
 	
Once a container is scanned, identified (matched to database) and determined to be a participating container, it is processed and typically crushed (for one-time-use containers) to reduce its size, to avoid spillages of liquid and to increase storage capacity. Refillable containers are collected and sorted by hand to be brought back to the bottling company.  The machines can use [[material recognition]] instead of/as well as a [[bar code scanner]] when needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reversevending.co.uk Description of use of a reverse vending machine from reVend, UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first patent for a "Bottle Return and Handling Machine" was filed in the United States in 1920.&lt;ref name="ReverseVending_About"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reversevending.co.uk/About_Reverse_Vending.html |title=About Reverse Vending Machines |publisher=Reverse Vending |accessdate=2014-09-12 |quote=The first patent for a “Empty Container Return and Handling Machine” with a coin return mechanism was filed in America on 13th September 1920 by Elmer M Jones and Sue Walker Vance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4391">In mathematics, a '''Rothberger space''' is a [[topological space]] that satisfies a certain a basic [[selection principle]]. A Rothberger space is a space in which for every sequence of open covers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1, \mathcal{U}_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; of the space there are sets &lt;math&gt; U_1 \in \mathcal{U}_1, U_2 \in \mathcal{U}_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that the family &lt;math&gt;\{U_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt; covers the space.

== History ==
In 1938, Fritz Rothberger introduced his property known as &lt;math&gt;C''&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothberger|first=Fritz|date=1938-01-01|title=Eine Verschärfung der Eigenschaft C|url=http://pldml.icm.edu.pl/pldml/element/bwmeta1.element.bwnjournal-article-fmv30i1p8bwm?q=bwmeta1.element.bwnjournal-number-fm-1938-30-1;7&amp;qt=CHILDREN-STATELESS|journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae|language=DE|volume=30|issue=1|issn=0016-2736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characterizations ==

=== Combinatorial characterization ===
For subsets of the real line, the Rothberger property can be characterized using continuous functions into the [[Baire space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. A subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is guessable if there is a function &lt;math&gt;g\in A&lt;/math&gt; such that the sets  &lt;math&gt; \{n:f(n)=g(n)\}&lt;/math&gt; are infinite for all functions &lt;math&gt; f\in A&lt;/math&gt;. A subset of the real line is Rothberger iff every continuous image of that space into the Baire space is guessable. In particular, every subset of the real line of cardinality less than [[Cichoń's diagram|&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{M})&lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Nkzbkj-c83YC|title=Set Theory: On the Structure of the Real Line|last=Bartoszynski|first=Tomek|last2=Judah|first2=Haim|date=1995-08-15|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=9781568810447|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is Rothberger.

=== Topological game characterization ===
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. The Rothberger game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_1(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; played on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a game with two players Alice and Bob.

'''1st round''': Alice chooses an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Bob chooses a set &lt;math&gt;U_1\in \mathcal{U}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''2nd round''': Alice chooses an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_2&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Bob chooses a finite set &lt;math&gt;U_2\in\mathcal{U}_2&lt;/math&gt;.

'''etc.'''

If the family &lt;math&gt;\{U_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt; is a cover of the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then Bob wins the game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_1(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise, Alice wins.

A player has a winning strategy if he knows how to play in order to win the game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_1(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; (formally, a winning strategy is a function).

'''Sentience''' is the capacity to [[feeling|feel]], [[perception|perceive]] or [[subjectivity|experience subjectively]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sentience&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteenth-century philosophers used the concept to distinguish the ability to think (''[[reason]]'') from the ability to feel (''sentience''). In modern Western philosophy, sentience is the ability to experience [[sensation (psychology)|sensations]] (known in [[philosophy of mind]] as "[[qualia]]"). In Eastern philosophy, sentience is a metaphysical quality of all things that require respect and care. The concept is central to the philosophy of [[animal rights]] because sentience is necessary for the ability to [[suffering|suffer]], and thus is held to [[logical consequence|confer]] certain rights.

==Philosophy and sentience==
In the philosophy of [[consciousness]], ''sentience'' can refer to the ability of any entity to have subjective perceptual experiences, or as some philosophers refer to them, "[[qualia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is distinct from other aspects of the [[mind]] and consciousness, such as [[creativity]], [[intelligence]], [[sapience]], [[self-awareness]], and [[intentionality]] (the ability to have thoughts about something). Sentience is a minimalistic way of defining ''consciousness'', which otherwise commonly and collectively describes sentience plus other characteristics of the mind.

Some philosophers, notably [[Colin McGinn]], believe that sentience will never be understood, a position known as "[[new mysterianism]]". They do not deny that most other aspects of consciousness are subject to scientific investigation but they argue that [[qualia|subjective experiences]] will never be explained; i.e., sentience is the ''only'' aspect of consciousness that can't be explained. Other philosophers (such as [[Daniel Dennett]], who also argues that non-human animals are not sentient) disagree, arguing that all aspects of consciousness will eventually be explained by science.&lt;ref name="Ransey"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Eliminative Materialism | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher=Stanford University | accessdate=19 June 2014 | author=Ramsey, William | editor=Zalta, Edward N. | year=2013 | edition=Summer 2013 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/materialism-eliminative/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian religions==
{{See also|Sentient beings (Buddhism)}}
Eastern religions including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]], and [[Jainism]] recognise [[non-human]]s as sentient beings. In Jainism and Hinduism, this is closely related to the concept of [[ahimsa]], nonviolence toward other beings. In Jainism, all matter is endowed with sentience; there are five degrees of sentience, from one to five.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Water, for example, is a sentient being of the first order, as it is considered to possess only one sense, that of touch. Man is considered a sentient being of the fifth order. According to Buddhism, sentient beings made of pure consciousness are possible. In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, which includes [[Zen]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the concept is related to the [[Bodhisattva]], an enlightened being devoted to the liberation of others. The first [[Bodhisattva vows|vow]] of a Bodhisattva states: "Sentient beings are numberless; I vow to free them."

[[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|Sentience in Buddhism]] is the state of having senses (''sat + ta'' in Pali, or ''sat + tva'' in Sanskrit). In Buddhism, there are six senses, the sixth being the subjective experience of the mind. Sentience is simply awareness prior to the arising of [[Skandha]]. Thus, an animal qualifies as a sentient being.

==Animal welfare, rights, and sentience==
{{main|Animal consciousness|Animal cognition|Animal welfare|Animal rights|Pain in animals}}
In the philosophies of animal welfare and rights, sentience implies the ability to experience [[pleasure]] and [[suffering|pain]]. Additionally, it has been argued, as in the documentary ''Earthlings'': {{quote|Granted, these animals do not have all the desires we humans have; granted, they do not comprehend everything we humans comprehend; nevertheless, we and they do have some of the same desires and do comprehend some of the same things. The desires for food and water, shelter and companionship, freedom of movement and avoidance of pain.&lt;ref&gt;Monson S (2005), "Earthlings".&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Animal-welfare advocates typically argue that any sentient being is entitled, at a minimum, to protection from unnecessary suffering, though animal-rights advocates may differ on what rights (e.g., the right to life) may be entailed by simple sentience. [[Sentiocentrism]] describes the theory that sentient individuals are the center of moral concern.

The 18th-century philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] compiled enlightenment beliefs in ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'', and he included his own reasoning in a comparison between slavery and [[sadistic personality disorder|sadism]] toward animals:

{{quotation|The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor [see Louis XIV's [[Code Noir]]]... What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or, perhaps, the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the [''sic''] question is not, Can they ''reason?'' nor, Can they ''talk?'' but, Can they ''suffer?''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation (A New Edition, corrected by the Author)|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|author-link=Jeremy Bentham|date=1879|orig-year=This edition first published 1823|chapter=Chapter XVII. Of the Limits of the Penal Branch of Jurisprudence|at=p. 311 footnote|url=https://archive.org/stream/anintroductiont01bentgoog#page/n349/mode/1up|publisher=Clarendon Press|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 20th century, Princeton University professor [[Peter Singer]] argued that Bentham's conclusion is often dismissed by an appeal to a distinction that condemns human suffering but allows non-human suffering, typically "appeals" that are [[logical fallacies]] (unless the distinction is factual, in which case the appeal is just one logical fallacy, ''[[begging the question|petitio principii]]''). Because many of the suggested distinguishing features of humanity—extreme intelligence; highly complex language; etc.—are not present in marginal cases such as mute humans, young children, deaf humans, and mentally disabled humans, it appears that the only distinction is a prejudice based on species alone, which animal-rights supporters call [[speciesism]]—that is, differentiating humans from other animals purely on the grounds that they are human. His opponents accuse him of the same petitio principii.

[[Gary Francione]] also bases his [[abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionist]] theory of animal rights, which differs significantly from Singer's, on sentience. He asserts that, "All sentient beings, humans or nonhuman, have one right: the basic right not to be treated as the property of others."&lt;ref&gt;Francione, Gary. [http://www.abolitionistapproach.com/?page_id=52 Official blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Linzey]], founder of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics in England, is known as a foremost international advocate for recognising animals as sentient beings in biblically based faith traditions. The Interfaith Association of [[Animal Chaplain]]s encourages animal ministry groups to adopt a policy of recognising and valuing sentient beings.

In 1997 the concept of [[Animal Sentience (journal)|animal sentience]] was written into the basic law of the European Union. The legally binding protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam recognises that animals are "sentient beings", and requires the EU and its member states to "pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals".

The laws of several states include certain invertebrates such as cephalopods (octopuses, squids) and decapod crustaceans (lobsters, crabs) in the scope of animal protection laws, implying that these animals are also judged capable of [[Pain in invertebrates|experiencing pain]] and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ciwf.org.uk/animal_sentience/policy_and_culture/default.aspx Science, policy and cultural implications of animal sentience, Compassion in World Farming]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial intelligence==
The term "sentience" is not used by major [[artificial intelligence]] textbooks and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;See the four most popular AI textbooks (or [[Talk:Artificial intelligence/Textbook survey|Wikipedia's survey of their contents]]), none of which mention "sentience" at all:
* {{Cite book |first=George |last=Luger |author-link=George Luger |first2=William |last2=Stubblefield |author2-link=William Stubblefield |year=2004 |title=Artificial Intelligence: Structures and Strategies for Complex Problem Solving |edition=5th |publisher=The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc. |isbn=0-8053-4780-1 |url=http://www.cs.unm.edu/~luger/ai-final/tocfull.html}}
* {{Cite book |last=Nilsson |first=Nils |author-link=Nils Nilsson (researcher) |year=1998 |title=Artificial Intelligence: A New Synthesis |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers |isbn=978-1-55860-467-4}}

==Science fiction==
{{See also|Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|Personhood}}
{{Original research section|date=May 2015}}
In [[science fiction]], an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]], [[android (robot)|android]], [[robot]], [[hologram]], or [[computer]] described as "sentient" is usually treated as a fully human character, with similar rights, qualities, and capabilities as any other character; it is not human, but in this work of fiction it has genuine "[[personhood]]". "Sentience", in this context, is a hypothetical [[essentialism|essential]] human property that brings many other qualities associated with [[personhood]] with it, such as [[volition (psychology)|will]], [[desire]], [[intelligence]], [[autonomy]], [[humor]], [[aesthetic appreciation]] and so on. Science fiction uses the words "[[intelligence]]", "[[sapience]]", "[[self-awareness]]", and "[[consciousness]]" in similar ways.

This unique definition permits usage that would not make sense outside of science fiction. For example, Commander Data describing his cat as "not sentient" in one episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', whereas the term was originally used (by philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] and others) to emphasize the sentience of animals (certainly including cats).

Science fiction has explored several forms of consciousness beside that of the individual human mind, and how such forms might perceive and function. These include group sentience, where a single mind is composed of multiple non-sentient members (sometimes capable of reintegration, where members can be gained or lost, resulting in gradually shifting mentalities); hive sentience, which is the extreme form of insect hives, with a single sentience extended over huge numbers of non-sentient bodies; and transient sentience, where a lifeform is sentient of that transience.

==Sentience quotient==

The sentience quotient concept was introduced by [[Robert A. Freitas Jr.]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Freitas"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Xenopsychology | author = Freitas, R.A., Jr. | journal=[[Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact]] |date=April 1984  | volume=104 | pages=41–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines sentience as the relationship between the information processing rate of each individual processing unit (neuron), the weight/size of a single unit, and the total number of processing units (expressed as mass). It was proposed as a measure for the sentience of all living beings and computers from a single neuron up to a hypothetical being at the theoretical computational limit of the entire universe. On a [[logarithmic scale]] it runs from −70 up to +50.

==Incarnations==
It is thought{{by whom|date=December 2015}} that Serapis Bey was incarnated as a high priest in one of the "Temples of the Sacred Fire" on [[Atlantis]]{{clarify|date=December 2015}} who migrated to [[Egypt]] at the time of the destruction of [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 -Summit University Page 149&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that he was incarnated as the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] [[Amenhotep III]] (who constructed the [[Temple of Luxor]] to the god [[Amun]]) &lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 -Summit University Page 153&lt;/ref&gt; and also as [[Leonidas]], the King of [[Sparta]],&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 -Summit University Page 150&lt;/ref&gt; who was killed in 480 BC defending the pass of [[Thermopylae]] against the invasion of Greece by Emperor [[Xerxes I of Persia]].
According to the teachings of Agni Yoga,&lt;ref&gt;Elena Ivanovna Roerich. Letters to America. In 4 Vols (1923-1952).  - T. 4.  - Moscow: Sfera, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Serapis Bey was in past lives the Roman King Numa Pompilius, the philosophers Confucius, Plato and Lucius Anneus Seneca. He is referred in the book Supermundane as "The Thinker".

==Ascension==
Adherents of the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] believe that Serapis Bey, after being killed as Leonidas in the battle of Thermopylae, immediately reembodied as [[Phidias]] (c. 480 BC - c. 430 BC), the greatest of all classical Greek sculptors.&lt;ref name="Life Book II"&gt;Luk, A.D.K..

==Identification with the Hellenistic deity Serapis==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Serapis.jpg|thumb|180px|Serapis. {{puic|Serapis.jpg|log=16 September 2009}}]] --&gt;
Serapis Bey has been identified by Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings with the god [[Serapis]] who was the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] [[Hellenistic]]/[[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] [[god (male deity)|god]] used by King [[Ptolemy I]] as the [[god (male deity)|deity]] of his capital city of [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 -Summit University Page 156&lt;/ref&gt; Serapis was the patron deity of the [[Library of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Carl ''Cosmos'' New York:1980 Random House Pages 20 and 21: Illustrations show Serapis presiding over the Great Hall of the Great Library of Alexandria&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function in the spiritual hierarchy==
[[C. W. Leadbeater]] wrote that many [[artist]]s are on the fourth ray of harmony and beauty, which Serapis Bey is said to oversee as Chohan.&lt;ref name="Path" /&gt;  In the teachings of [[Alice Bailey]] the fourth ray is called the ray of ''harmony through conflict''.&lt;ref name=fire1237/&gt; [[Ascended Master Teachings]] organizations consider Serapis Bey to be the Chohan of the Fourth Ray of Purity, Harmony, and Discipline.&lt;ref name="Life Book II" /&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K.

Innovations conventionally associated with terrestrially first appeared in aquatic [[elpistostegalians]] such as ''[[Panderichthys]] rhombolepis'', ''[[Elpistostege]] watsoni'', and ''[[Tiktaalik roseae]]''. Phylogenetic analyses distribute the features that developed along the tetrapod stem and display a stepwise process of character acquisition, rather than abrupt.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J.

By the [[Upper Devonian]] period, the fin-limb transition as well as other skeletal changes such as gill arch reduction, opercular series loss, mid-line fin loss, and scale reduction were already completed in many aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=coates&gt;Coates, M.I., Jeffery, J.E., &amp; Ruta, M.

Evolution and Development 4(5), 390–396. doi:10.1046/j.1525-142X.2002.02026.x&lt;/ref&gt; As aquatic tetrapods began their transition to land, several skeletal changes are thought to have occurred to allow for movement and respiration on land. Some adaptations required to adjust to non-aquatic life include the movement and use of alternating limbs, the use of pelvic appendages as sturdy propulsors, and the use of a solid surface at the organism’s base to generate propulsive force required for walking.&lt;ref name=king&gt;King, H.M., Shubin, N.H., Coates, M.I., &amp; Hale, M.E.

==Head==

=== Head changes in [[Osteichthyes]] ===

[[File:Osteolepis BW.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Restoration of ''Osteolepis'']] 

The [[Osteolepiformes]] and Elpistostegalia are two crown groups of rhipidistians with respect to the tetrapods.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of skull roof and cheekbone patterns in these organisms match those found in the first tetrapods. Palatal and nasal skeletal features like choanae are present in these groups and are also observed in modern amphibians. This indicates that incipient air breathing was developed, as well as modification of the hyoid arch towards stapes development.&lt;ref name=clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). A revised reconstruction of the dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(02), 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics account for why osteichthyans are accepted as the sister group of tetrapods.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;

The elpistostegalid fish are considered the most apomorphic of fish in comparison to tetrapods.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;  From well-preserved fossils, it is observed that they share a paltybasic skull with eye ridges, and external nares situated on the margin of the mouth.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J. P., Daeschler, E. B., Jenkins, F. A., &amp; Shubin, N. H. (2008). The cranial endoskeleton of Tiktaalik roseae. Nature, 455(7215), 925-929.&lt;/ref&gt; Development of eye ridges and flatting of the skull are also observed in primitive fossil amphibians and reptiles. The most likely reason for the traits to be adaptive was for their use in aerial vision above the waterline.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; The traits enabled animals to check area on land for safe spots if being chased by a predator in water, as well as being useful for searching for prey items above the water. The water-based [[lateral line system]] was used substantially by these aquatic tetrapods to detect danger from predators.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Osteichthyan diversification, there were no changes related to respiration in the transition as can be seen by the nasal region and palatal morphology in elpistostegalid fishes. The primary change from basic ostelepiform ancestors to the first elpistostegalid in the middle Devonian was to the pre-existing roof skulls.&lt;ref&gt;LONG, J. A. (1990). Heterochrony and the origin of tetrapods. Lethaia, 23(2), 157-166.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Head changes in prototetrapod ===

[[File:Elginerpeton BW.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Restoration of ''Elginerpeton'']]

In ''[[Elginerpeton pancheni]]'', a prototetrapod from the late [[Frasnian]], basic tetrapod characteristics in the lower jaw and the cranium are observed. The taxon is believed to fill the gap between elpistostegalid fishes and well-preserved Devonian tetrapods. The ''Elginerpeton'' is considered more derived than the elpistostegalid fishes due to presence of paired fangs on the parasymphysial toothplate, a slender shaped anterior coronoid, and in the loss of the intracranial joint and coronoid fossa.&lt;ref name=Ahlberg1998&gt;Ahlberg, P. E., &amp; Clack, J. A. (1998). Lower jaws, lower tetrapods–a review based on the Devonian genus Acanthostega. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Earth Sciences, 89(01), 11-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the intercranial joint was a direct functional necessity to strengthen the broad and long platybasic skull when the animal was out of the water.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tubular lower jaw of the ''Elginerpeton'', compared to the flat-lamina jaw shape of fishes gave it superior cross-sectional force, required when not supported in an aquatic setting – allowing for opening of the mouth outside of water. The adaptation may also be interpreted as a specialization for buccopharyngeal breathing. It is speculated to be the first step towards aerial respiration in the transition from fish to tetrapod.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Head changes in aquatic tetrapods ===
[[File:Acanthostega BW.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Restoration of ''Acanthostega'']] 
In the tetrapod and higher clades from the lower-middle [[Famennian]] there are several defining changes on the basis of anatomy of ''[[Ichthyostega]]'', ''[[Tulerpeton]]'', and ''[[Acanthostega]]''. In the cranium, there is a stapes derived from the hyomandibular of fishes; a single bilateral pair of nasal bones, and a fenestra ovalis in the otic capsule of the braincase.&lt;ref&gt;Lebedev, O. A., &amp; Coates, M. I. (1995). The postcranial skeleton of the Devonian tetrapod Tulerpeton curtum Lebedev. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 114(3), 307-348.&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening of the otic wall of the braincase can be considered a paedomorphic feature for tetrapods and is linked to the stapes functionally.&lt;ref name=Clack1994&gt;Clack, J. A. (1994). Earliest known tetrapod braincase and the evolution of the stapes and fenestra ovalis.&lt;/ref&gt; The stapes was thought to be just a structural support between the palate and the stapedial plate of the braincase.&lt;ref name=Clack1994&gt;Clack, J. A. (1994). Earliest known tetrapod braincase and the evolution of the stapes and fenestra ovalis.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Acanthostega'', it is likely that due to the otic capsule of the brain case being mesial to the stapedial plate, sound was picked up from the palate or the otic notch to allow for rudimentary hearing. It was able to perceive vibrations by opening its mouth by way of the palate. Other factors that caused aquatic tetrapods to spend more time on land caused the development of terrestrial hearing with the development of a tympanum within an otic notch and developed by convergent evolution at least three times.&lt;ref&gt;Laurin, M. (1998, March). The importance of global parsimony and historical bias in understanding tetrapod evolution. Part I. Systematics, middle ear evolution and jaw suspension. In Annales des Sciences Naturelles-Zoologie et Biologie Animale (Vol. 19, No. 1, pp. 1-42). Elsevier Masson.&lt;/ref&gt;
There was also a change in the dermal bones of the skull in the aquatic tetrapods.&lt;ref name=clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). A revised reconstruction of the dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(02), 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt; It involved the enlargement of the jugal, ceasing the contact of the maxilla with the squamosal and the single bilateral pair of nasal bones. The feature allows for a stronger bite as well as increasing the strength of the skull.&lt;ref name=clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). A revised reconstruction of the dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(02), 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teeth and feeding mechanisms ===

Feeding on land is a completely different task than feeding in water. Water is much more dense and viscous compared to air, causing hunting techniques adapted in water to be less successful when applied on land.&lt;ref name=Lauder&gt;Lauder, G. V. (1985). Aquatic feeding in lower vertebrates. Functional vertebrate morphology, 210-229.&lt;/ref&gt; The main technique used in water is suction feeding and is used by most aquatic vertebrates. This technique does not function in air so animals use methods of overtaking prey with jaws followed by biting down.&lt;ref&gt;Bramble, D. M., Liem, K. F., &amp; Wake, D. B. (1985). Functional vertebrate morphology (pp. 38-57). Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Transitional forms prior to fully developed terrestrial tetrapods such as ''Acanthostega'', are thought to have captured prey in the water.&lt;ref name=Clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). The dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(01), 17-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Large coronoid fangs are present in the fishes ''Eusthenopteron'', ''Panderichthys'', and ''Tiktaalik'', and the early tetrapod, ''Ventasega''. In ''Acanthostega'', which is more derived, the large teeth are absent. In ''Eusthenopetron'' and ''Panderichthys'', an ossified operculum is exhibited unlike in the ''Tiktaalik'', ''Ventastega'', and ''Acanthostega''. These differences as well as reductions of the gill chamber and changes in the nature of the lower jaw are hypothesized to indicate a reduced reliance on suction feeding in early tetrapods in comparison to osteolepiform fish.&lt;ref name=Ahlberg1998&gt;Ahlberg, P. E., &amp; Clack, J. A. (1998). Lower jaws, lower tetrapods–a review based on the Devonian genus Acanthostega. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Earth Sciences, 89(01), 11-46.&lt;/ref&gt; This morphological data is not enough however to prove that suction feeding was less used as the morphological changes have been found in fish that use the suction feeding mechanism.&lt;ref name=Clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). The dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(01), 17-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cranial sutures are indicators of skull function and morphologies can be linked to specific feeding modes.&lt;ref&gt;Herring, S. W., &amp; Mucci, R. J. (1991). In vivo strain in cranial sutures: the zygomatic arch. Journal of morphology, 207(3), 225-239.&lt;/ref&gt; Transitional feeding changes can be observed by examining cross sectional morphology of a suture in taxa of the fish-tetrapod transition.&lt;ref name= Markey2007&gt;Markey, M. J., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2007). Terrestrial-style feeding in a very early aquatic tetrapod is supported by evidence from experimental analysis of suture morphology. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(17), 7134-7138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparing positionally comparable sutures in extant fish allows for the creation of a sutural morphospace.&lt;ref&gt;Markey, M. J., Main, R. P., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2006). In vivo cranial suture function and suture morphology in the extant fish Polypterus: implications for inferring skull function in living and fossil fish. Journal of Experimental Biology, 209(11), 2085–2102.&lt;/ref&gt; The main cause of sutural deformation is caused by strain during feeding activity, most prominent with feeding mechanisms involving sucking a prey into the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Markey, M. J., Main, R. P., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2006). In vivo cranial suture function and suture morphology in the extant fish ''[[Polypterus]]'': implications for inferring skull function in living and fossil fish. Journal of Experimental Biology, 209(11), 2085–2102.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tension anteriorly, and compression posteriorly strain patterns are observed in ''Polypterus'', a prey-sucking predator. In terrestrial tetrapod ''[[Phonerpeton]]'', there is compression between the frontals and parietals and a complex loading between the post parietals. There is no evidence of tensile strain in any sutures. ''Acanthostega'' fossil records demonstrate that no strain pattern was exhibited that relate to prey capture by means of suction. The load compression is similar to extant tetrapods. It is most likely that the organism captured prey by biting in the water or near the edge of the water. This finding indicates that the terrestrial mode of feeding first emerged in an aquatic environment.&lt;ref name= Markey2007&gt;Markey, M. J., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2007). Terrestrial-style feeding in a very early aquatic tetrapod is supported by evidence from experimental analysis of suture morphology. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(17), 7134-7138.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neck ==
The cranial endoskeleton of ''T. roseae'' shares derived features with tetrapods. There was a loss of opercular and extrascapular elements, enhancing head mobility in ''T. roseae'' compared to other tetrapodomorph fish.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J. P., Daeschler, E. B., Jenkins, F. A., &amp; Shubin, N. H. (2008). The cranial endoskeleton of Tiktaalik roseae. Nature, 455(7215), 925-929.&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of the neck allowed for locomotion in shallow waters. This environment allows for less motility compared to the three-dimensional space that fish are able to orient themselves in. The body of the organism in these environments would be fixed in the shallow pools with appendages planted on a substrate.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J. P., Daeschler, E. B., Jenkins, F. A., &amp; Shubin, N. H. (2008). The cranial endoskeleton of Tiktaalik roseae. Nature, 455(7215), 925-929.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Acanthostega'' and ''Ichthyostega'', which are considered to be more derived than other basal aquatic tetrapods, the pectoral girdle is decoupled from the skull. There is also a loss of the dorsal pectoral girdle bones, which permits a large degree of movement for the shoulder. This allowed for a greater degree of movement, and is a necessity for improving aquatic maneuveurs and terrestrial locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Z., Ahlberg, P., &amp; Ritchie, A. (2003). The braincase and palate of the tetrapodomorph sarcopterygian Mandageria fairfaxi: morphological variability near the fish–tetrapod transition. Palaeontology, 46(2), 271-293.&lt;/ref&gt; This could have been driven by the need to lift the head to aid aerial respiration by using nostrils and choanae.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limbs ==

Limbs in vertebrates are occasionally organized into stylopod (relating to the humerus and femur), zeugopod (relating to the radius and tibia, along with associated structures) and autopod (relating to digits) categories, although anatomically, the evolutionary differences between these groups in early tetrapods tends to be vague.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gilbert&gt;Gilbert, S.F. (2000). Development of the tetrapod limb. Developmental Biology 6. Retrieved from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9975/&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The transition from fins to limbs occurred once an endoskeleton entered the base of the fin, as seen in today's lungfish.&lt;ref name=hinch&gt;Hinchliffe, R.J. (1994). Evolutionary developmental biology of the tetrapod limb. Developmental 1994 Supplement, 163-168.&lt;/ref&gt; This is thought to have originated in the group [[Sarcopterygians]], including osteolipiforms like ''Eusthenopteron'', due to the homology of the tetrapod forelimb and the osteolepiform fin endoskeleton.&lt;ref name=hinch /&gt;

''Acanthostega'' is a partially aquatic tetrapod with developed limbs that shares features common with the earlier tetrapods, ''Panderichthys'' and ''Eusthenopteron''.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; Like ''Panderichthys'',  the humerus of ''Acanthostega'' is flattened dorso-ventrally, the intermedium terminates level with the radius, and the endoskeleton can be divided into stylopodium, zeugopodium and autopodium segments.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; Similar to ''Eusthenopteron'', the radials do not articulate with the radius on the distal end.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;  ''Acanthostega'' also has a 1:2 ratio of humerus to radius and ulna, a feature seen in all tetrapods higher than ''Acanthostega'' on the phylogeny.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;

Unlike ''Panderichthys'', ''Acanthostega'' hind limbs are at least the size of its fore limbs, if not larger.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; This development of larger limbs is required to physically support the organism during emergence from an aquatic setting to land. The humerus and femur of ''Acanthostega'' also contain evidence of greater development of the appendicular muscles compared to more aquatic tetrapods, hinting at the presence of digits.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;

Similarly, ''Ossinodus'' has two hindlimbs located bilaterally and proximodistally aymmetrical.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the presence of a small femur during juvenile development, this Carboniferous- period tetrapod is thought to be aquatic during juvenile development; only emerging onto land once it reaches adulthood.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ossinodus'' also has a broad, flat tibia, akin to ''Acanthostega'', and is thought to be only partially terrestrial.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pelvis ==
The development of the pelvic region was crucial for the adaptation from water to land, yet some features of tetrapod locomotion are thought to have arose before the origin of digited limbs or the transition from water to land.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; The fossil record of early tetrapods shows evidence of distinct pelvic development occurring in osteolepiforms, further supporting osteolepiform ancestry of terrestrial tetrapods.&lt;ref name=king /&gt;

''Acanthostega'' has a large pelvis, with the iliac region articulating with the axial skeleton and a broad ischial plate.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; It has a sacrum; a fundamental skeletal feature that allows the organism to transfer force produced in its hindlimbs to its axial skeleton, and move in a terrestrial environment.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; A pubo-ischiadic symphysis is also observed, uniting the two pelvic halves.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;

In contrast, ''[[Protopterus]] annectens'' (a member of lungfish, thought to be a sister group to tetrapods) has a small, anatomically simpler pelvis, a derived limb endoskeleton and a lack of digits.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; Yet, it shares the ability to lift itself using a solid surface as a base with its pelvic region with ''Acanthostega'' and is also observed to move with tetrapod-like locomotion in an aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; This illustrates that a fundamental innovation in tetrapods is also found in a lower, sister taxon, in which members lack a sacrum.&lt;ref name=king /&gt;

== Digits and Limb Joints ==

''Acanthostega'' is the earliest example of a digitized tetrapod.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; The humerus and femur of ''Acanthostega'' contain evidence of greater development of the appendicular muscles compared to more aquatic tetrapods.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; ''Acanthostega'' has a total lack of dermal fin rays and displays the presence of two or more spool-shaped bones or cartilages articulating individually in antero-posterial sets on the distal end of its limbs.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; This feature can now be distinguished as digits instead of the endoskeletal radials seen in earlier tetrapods.

''[[Pederpes]]'', a tetrapod from the Early Carboniferous period, also has hindlimbs containing 5 digits that are rotated to face anteriorly.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous tetrapods, who have been only partially adapted to land, ''Pederpes'' has the novel ability to bend its limbs and propel itself forwards in a terrestrial setting. This is attributed to the symmetry of the digits and limbs in ''Pederpes'', allowing it to rotate its hindlimbs to an anteriorly facing position and propel itself from the edge of the foot when moving forward.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; This morphological development of bendable wrists and ankles can distinguish ''Pederpes'' the first true terrestrial tetrapod.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1443">'''Soil defertilisation''' refers to the practice of reducing [[soil fertility]] in order to reduce the number of plants that can grow on that soil. It is often done on land not intended for agriculture, such as city parks.

== Benefit ==
On land not intended for agriculture, such as city parks or other communal spaces, undesired plants (weeds) can become a nuisance to the city's communal services, costing effort and money.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In some cases, along with soil defertilisation, the soil's pH and water content can be altered. This may create a much different environment, allowing more specialised plants/vegetation to grow and take hold.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

== In practice ==
Soil defertilisation is done by growing [[Green_manure|specific cover crops]] (e.g., ''[[Phacelia]]'', ''[[White mustard|Sinapis alba]]'', ''[[Lolium multiflorum]]'') on them and then, instead of ploughing them under, removing them from the soil. By doing this, the nutrients that have accumulated in the crops are removed together with the crops. The crops may be used on other land that needs to be [[Fertilizer|fertilsed]] (instead of defertilised), for example agricultural land.&lt;ref&gt;Stappen naar een ecologische tuin: aanleg en beheer by Geertje Coremans, page 63&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}

The idea of a '''sphere-world''' was constructed by [[Henri Poincaré]] who, while pursuing his argument for [[conventionalism]] (see [[philosophy of space and time]]),  offered a [[thought experiment]] about a [[sphere]] with strange properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poincaré|first1=Henri|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37157|via=[[Project Gutenberg]]|title=Science and hypothesis|date=1952|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=0486602214|page=51|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept==
Poincaré asks us to imagine a sphere of radius ''R''.  The temperature of the sphere decreases from its maximum at the center to absolute zero at its extremity such that a body’s temperature at a distance ''r'' from the center is proportional to &lt;math&gt;R^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

In addition, all bodies have the same [[coefficient of thermal expansion|coefficient of dilatation]] so every body shrinks and expands in similar proportion as they move about the sphere.  To finish the story, Poincaré states that the [[refractive index|index of refraction]] will also vary with the distance ''r'', in [[inverse proportion]] to &lt;math&gt;R^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

How will this world look to inhabitants of this sphere? 

In many ways it will look ''normal''. Bodies will remain intact upon transfer from place to place, as well as seeming to remain the same size (the Spherians would shrink along with them).  The geometry, on the other hand, would seem quite different.  Supposing the inhabitants were to view rods believed to be rigid, or measure [[distance]] with [[light beam|light rays]]. They would find that a [[geodesic]] is not a straight line, and that the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its radius is greater than &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

These inhabitants would in fact determine that their universe is not ruled by [[Euclidean geometry]], but instead by [[hyperbolic geometry]].

==Commentary==

This [[thought experiment]] is discussed in [[Roberto Torretti]]'s book ''Philosophy of Geometry from Riemann to Poincaré''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torretti|first1=Roberto|title=Philosophy of geometry from Riemann to Poincaré|date=1984|publisher=D. Reidel Pub. Co.|location=Dordrecht, Holland|isbn=9027709203|page=320|edition=[New ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Jeremy Gray]]'s article "Epistemology of Geometry" in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Epistemology of Geometry |author1=Jeremy Gray|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-geometry/|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sphere-world is also described in [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]]'s book ''[[Flatterland]]'' (chapter 10, Platterland).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7780">'''Statistical disclosure control''' ('''SDC'''), also known as '''statistical disclosure limitation''' ('''SDL''') or '''disclosure avoidance''', is a technique used in data-driven research to ensure no person or organization is identifiable from the results of an analysis of survey or administrative data, or in the release of [[Microdata (statistics)|microdata]]. The purpose of SDC is to protect the confidentiality of the respondents and subjects of the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skinner|first=Chris|date=2009|title=Statistical Disclosure Control for Survey Data|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/skinnecj/SDC%20for%20survey%20data%20S3RI.pdf|journal=Handbook of Statistics Vol 29A: Sample Surveys: Design, Methods and Applications.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main approaches to SDC: ''principles-based'' and ''rules-based.''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritchie|first=Felix, and Elliott, Mark|date=2015|title=Principles- Versus Rules-Based Output Statistical Disclosure Control In Remote Access Environments|url=http://www.iassistdata.org/sites/default/files/iqvol_39_2_ritchie.pdf|journal=IASSIST Quarterly v39 pp5-13|doi=|pmid=|access-date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In principles-based systems, disclosure control attempts to uphold a specific set of fundamental principles—for example, "no person should be identifiable in released microdata". Rules-based systems, in contrast, are evidenced by a specific set of rules that a person performing disclosure control follows, after which the data are presumed to be safe to release. Using this taxonomy, proposed by Ritchie and Elliot in 2013, disclosure control based on [[differential privacy]] can be seen as a principles-based approach, whereas controls based on de-identification, such as the US [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]]'s Privacy Rule's Safe Harbor method for de-identifying [[protected health information]] can be seen as a rule-based system.

== Necessity ==
Many kinds of [[Social research|social]], economic and health research use potentially sensitive data as a basis for their research, such as survey or [[Census]] data, tax records, health records, educational information, etc. Such information is usually given in confidence, and, in the case of [[Secondary data|administrative data]], not always for the purpose of research.

Researchers are not usually interested in information about one single person or business; they are looking for trends among larger groups of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adrn.ac.uk/protecting-privacy/safe-results/|title=ADRN » Safe results|website=adrn.ac.uk|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the data they use is, in the first place, linked to individual people and businesses, and SDC ensures that these cannot be identified from published data, no matter how detailed or broad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/statistics/methodology-quality/methodology/statistical-disclosure-control/|title=Government Statistical Services: Statistical Disclosure Control|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that at the end of data analysis, the researcher somehow singles out one person or business through their research. For example, a researcher may identify the exceptionally good or bad service in a geriatric department within a hospital in a remote area, where only one hospital provides such care. In that case, the data analysis 'discloses' the identity of the hospital, even if the dataset used for analysis was properly [[Anonymity|anonymised]] or de-identified.

Statistical disclosure control will identify this disclosure risk and ensure the results of the analysis are altered to protect confidentiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Templ|first=Matthias|date=2014|title=International Household Survey Network|url=http://www.ihsn.org/home/sites/default/files/resources/ihsn-working-paper-007-Oct27.pdf|journal=IHSN Working Paper|doi=|pmid=|access-date=March 2016|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires a balance between protecting confidentiality and ensuring the results of the data analysis are still useful for [[Statistics|statistical research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/general-methodology/statistical-disclosure-control/index.html|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/general-methodology/statistical-disclosure-control/index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-01-05|title=Archived: ONS Statistical Disclosure Control|date=|website=|publisher=Office for National Statistics|access-date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules-based SDC ==
In rules-based SDC, a rigid set of rules is used to determine whether or not the results of data analysis can be released. The rules are applied consistently, which makes it obvious what kinds of output are acceptable. However, because the rules are inflexible, either disclosive information may still slip through, or the rules are overrestrictive and may only allow for results that are too broad for useful analysis to be published.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency]] uses a rules-based approach to releasing statistics and research results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nisra.gov.uk/archive/census/2001/background/methodology.pdf|title=Census 2001 - Methodology|date=2001|website=|publisher=Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency|access-date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles-based SDC ==
In principles-based SDC, both the researcher and the output checker are trained in SDC. They receive a set of rules, which are rules-of-thumb rather than hard rules as in rules-based SDC. This means that in principle, any output may be approved or refused. The rules-of-thumb are a starting point for the researcher and explain from the beginning which outputs would be deemed safe and non-disclosive, and which outputs are unsafe. It is up to the researcher to prove that any 'unsafe' outputs are non-disclosive, but the checker has the final say. Since there are no hard rules, this requires specialist knowledge on disclosure risks from both the researcher and the checker. It encourages the researcher to produce safe results in the first place. However, this also means that the outcome may be inconsistent and uncertain. It requires extensive training and a high understanding of statistics and data analysis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[UK Data Service]] employs a principles-based approach to statistical disclosure control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.46/2013/Topic_3_Afkhami.pdf|title=Statistical Disclosure Control Practice in the Secure Access of the UK Data Service|last=Afkhamai|first=Reza|date=2013|website=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|publisher=|access-date=March 2016|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==
Many contemporary statistical disclosure control techniques, such as generalization and cell suppression, have been shown to be vulnerable to attack by a hypothetical data intruder. For example, Cox showed in 2009 that Complementary cell suppression typically leads to "over-protected" solutions because of the need to suppress both primary and complementary cells, and even then can lead to the compromise of sensitive data when exact intervals are reported.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence H. Cox, Vulnerability of Complementary Cell Suppression to Intruder Attack, Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality (2009) 1, Number 2, pp. 235–251 http://repository.cmu.edu/jpc/vol1/iss2/8/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SERM''' (structured entity relationship model) is an amplification of the [[Entity-relationship model|ERM]] which is commonly used for [[data modeling]]. It was first proposed from Prof. Dr. [[Elmar Sinz|Elmar J. Sinz]] in 1988. The SERM is commonly used in the [[SAP AG|SAP]]-world for the [[data modeling]].&lt;ref name="Röthlin2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Röthlin|title=Management of Data Quality in Enterprise Resource Planning Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wyheQllcyh0C&amp;pg=PA118|year=2010|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|isbn=978-3-89936-963-2|pages=118–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Every order is referred to one customer. Orders without customers are illegal (order is an ER type). Customers without any orders are legal because they are independent Entities. 
* To every order there is belonging at least one order item. 
* Every order item is related to exactly one order. 
* Every invoice is referred to one customer, as well. Invoices without customers are illegal. Customers without any invoice are legal.
* To every invoice there is belonging at least one invoice line item.
* Every invoice line item is related to exactly order item. An order item could be calculated or not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8078">'''Transferred intent''' (or '''transferred malice''' in [[English law]]) is a legal doctrine that holds that, when the [[intention (criminal law)|intention]] to harm one individual inadvertently causes a second person to be hurt instead, the perpetrator is still held responsible. To be held legally responsible under the law, usually the court must demonstrate that the person has criminal intent, that is, that the person knew another would be harmed by his or her actions and wanted this harm to occur. If a murderer intends to kill John, but accidentally kills George instead, the intent is transferred from John to George, and the killer is held to have had criminal intent.

Transferred intent also applies to tort law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/torts/torts01.htm|title=LexisNexis® for Law Schools – Sign In – LexisNexis|website=www.lexisnexis.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[tort law]], there are generally five areas in which transferred intent is applicable: [[battery (tort)|battery]], [[assault]], [[false imprisonment]], [[trespass to land]], and [[trespass to chattels]].  Generally, any ''intent'' to cause any one of these five torts which results in the completion of any of the five tortious acts will be considered an intentional act, even if the actual target of the tort is one other than the intended target of the original tort.

See cases of ''Carnes v. Thompson'', (1932) Supreme Court of Missouri. 48 S.W. 2d 903 and ''Bunyan v. Jordan'' (1937), 57 C.L.R. 1, 37 S.R.N.S.W. 119 for examples.

==Discussion==

=== In the United States ===
In US criminal law, transferred intent is sometimes explained by stating that "the intent follows the bullet."  That is, the intent to kill ''person A'' with a bullet will apply even when the bullet kills the unintended victim, ''person B'' (''see [[mens rea]]''). Thus, the ''intent'' is ''transferred'' between victims.  However, intent only transfers between harms of a similar nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Model Penal Code, 2.03(2)|url=http://www1.law.umkc.edu/suni/CrimLaw/MPC_Provisions/model_penal_code_default_rules.htm|accessdate=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if the defendant shoots at "Person A" intending to kill "A" but the bullet misses and instead hits a vase, causing it to break, the defendant is not deemed to have intended to break the vase.  This is because destruction of property is a kind of harm different from that contemplated by defendant.  The rationale underlying this distinction is that the defendant has only one intent.  If the law were to deem that the defendant intended to destroy property, it would be placing on him an intent he never had—he would now have both the intent to kill and the intent to destroy property.  In contrast, where the defendant intends to kill one person but ends up killing another, there's still only one intent—the intent to kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regina v. Faulkner Case Brief|url=http://homepage.mac.com/johnpell/LWSO100/regina%20v.%20faulkner.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is interesting to compare the principle underlying the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]] 2004 in the [[United States]] which applies only to offenses over which the U.S. government has jurisdiction, namely crimes committed on [[Federal Government of the United States|Federal]] properties, against certain [[Federal Government of the United States|Federal]] officials and employees, and by members of the military, but treats the [[fetus]] as a separate person for the purposes of all levels of [[assault]] including [[murder]] and [[attempted murder]]:
"Sec. 1841. Protection of unborn children
:(a)(1) Whoever engages in conduct that violates any of the provisions of law listed in subsection (b) and thereby causes the death of, or bodily injury (as defined in section 1365) to, a child, who is in utero at the time the conduct takes place, is guilty of a separate offense under this section.
:(2)(A) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the punishment for that separate offense is the same as the punishment provided under Federal law for that conduct had that injury or death occurred to the unborn child's mother.
:2(B) An offense under this section does not require proof that–
::(i) the person engaging in the conduct had knowledge or should have had knowledge that the victim of the underlying offense was pregnant; or
::(ii) the defendant intended to cause the death of, or bodily injury to, the unborn child.
:2(C) If the person engaging in the conduct thereby intentionally kills or attempts to kill the unborn child, that person shall instead of being punished under subparagraph (A), be punished as provided under sections 1111, 1112, and 1113 of this title for intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being."

=== In the United Kingdom ===
In the UK the transferred malice doctrine is not without controversy. The [[House of Lords]] in ''Attorney General's Reference  No  3  of  1994''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII
 | litigants = Attorney General's Reference No 3 of 1994

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reversed the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] decision (reported at (1996) 2 WLR 412), holding that the doctrine of transferred malice could not apply to convict an accused of [[murder in English law]] when the defendant had stabbed a pregnant woman in the face, back and abdomen. Some days after she was released from hospital in an apparently stable condition, she went into labour and gave birth to a premature child, who died four months later. The child had been wounded in the original attack but the more substantial cause of death was her prematurity. It was argued that the [[fetus]] was part of the mother so that any intention to cause [[grievous bodily harm]] (GBH) to the mother was also an intent aimed at the fetus. Lord Mustill criticised the doctrine as having no sound intellectual basis, saying that it was related to the original concept of malice, i.e. that a wrongful act displayed a malevolence which could be attached to any adverse consequence, and this had long been out of date. Nevertheless, it would sometimes provide a justification to convict when that was a common sense outcome and so could sensibly be retained. The present case was not a simple "transfer" from mother to uterine child, but sought to create an intention to cause injury to the child after birth. This would be a double transfer: first from the mother to the fetus, and then from the fetus to the child when it was born. Then one would have to apply the fiction which converts an intention to commit GBH into the ''mens rea'' of murder. That was too much. But the accused could be convicted of [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]].

In ''[[R v Gnango]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] controversially held that under the doctrines of joint enterprise and transferred malice D2 is guilty of V's murder if D1 and D2 voluntarily engage in fighting each other, each intending to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the other and each foreseeing that the other has the reciprocal intention, and if D1 mistakenly kills V in the course of the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Regina v Armel Gnango|link=R v Gnango|court=UKSC|reporter=|scotcase=|year=2011|volume=|firstpage=|num=59|format=|parallelcite=|date=14 December 2011|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections. Web. Retrieved 19 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  With their slogan of "neighbors helping neighbors since 1891", the United South End Settlements continues to serve Boston's [[South End, Boston|South End]] and [[Lower Roxbury Historic District|Lower Roxbury]] community today.&lt;ref name=USES&gt;{{cite web|title=United South End Settlements|url=http://www.uses.org/|website=United South End Settlements|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; USES has grown and evolved over time to remain relevant to the South End.&lt;ref name="USES History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.uses.org/about-us/history/|website=United South End Settlements|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The history of USES began in 1891 when William J. Tucker founded what was to become known as the South End House at 6 Rollins Street.&lt;ref name="NEU Finding Aid"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology|url=http://www.library.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m126findprint.htm}} ''Archives and Special Collections Finding Aids: United South End Settlements.'' Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections. Web. Retrieved 19 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The South End House would be the first of its kind "in Boston and the fourth one in the United States."&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; Before the incorporation of the final five organizations into USES, the Federation of South End Settlements was formed in 1950.&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; The Federation of South End Settlements was made up of the South End House, Lincoln House (1892), Hale House (1895), [[Harriet Tubman]] House (1904), Ellis Memorial House, and Eldridge House. This federation was founded in order to create a larger pool of funds for the organizations to share.&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; Eventually the Ellis Memorial and Eldridge Houses would disassociate themselves in 1959, and the four remaining houses and the Children's Art Centre would unite to become the United South End Settlements in January 1960.&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt;

USES originally focused on providing services to "[improve] housing, public health, and sanitation, developing day care programs that included medical care for children, and creating mental health programs."&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; Specifically, USES' "residents established milk stations, public baths, dispensaries, and services, such as emergency loan and stamp savings programs"&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; USES also founded "specialized schools for industrial, vocational, and employment training for both women and men" to create more opportunity in the South End neighborhood.&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; Culture and arts were not forgotten in the South End either as USES provided "free concerts, art exhibitions, reading rooms, and a variety of social, drama, and literary clubs" for its residents. As of 2014, USES still provides many of the same services that it has all along, incorporating the technology of today into its programs and curriculums for the residents of the South End and Lower Roxbury community.&lt;ref name= "USES" /&gt;

==Programs==
* '''After School Program'''
: 52 children, aged 5–12 years, are accepted into the USES After School Program. The program's mission is to "support school success and promote the social, cognitive, and emotional development of the students."&lt;ref name=ASP&gt;{{cite web|title=After School Program|url=http://www.uses.org/programs/asp/|website=United South End Settlements|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program runs the full year while school is in session, and during summer and vacation days.&lt;ref name= "ASP" /&gt;
* '''Camp Hale'''
: Camp Hale is offered to both boys and girls aged 6–14 years during the summer months.&lt;ref name= "CH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Camp Hale|url=http://www.uses.org/programs/camphale/|website=United South End Settlements|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summer sessions are divided by age and gender (e.g., all-girls ages 8-14 years). Camp Hale was founded on the principle that "all youth, particularly those from urban environments, will benefit from challenging opportunities for physical, mental, and social growth and development."&lt;ref name= "CH" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5752">[[File:Mercury Atlas vernier motor, Truax variant.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1960s [[Mercury-Atlas]] vernier thruster]]
[[File:Convair XSM-65B launch.jpg|thumb|upright|Vernier thrusters on the side of an [[Atlas missile]] can be seen emitting diagonal flames.]]

A '''vernier thruster''' is a [[rocket engine]] used on a [[spacecraft]] for fine adjustments to the attitude or velocity of a spacecraft. Depending on the design of a craft's maneuvering and stability systems, it may simply be a smaller thruster complementing the main propulsion system,&lt;ref name=nasa20111230/&gt; or it may complement larger [[attitude control]] thrusters,&lt;ref name=nasaRCS/&gt; or may be a part of the [[reaction control system]].
The name is derived from [[Vernier scale|vernier calipers]] (named after [[Pierre Vernier]]) which have a primary scale for gross measurements, and a secondary scale for fine measurements.

Vernier thrusters are used when a heavy spacecraft requires a wide range of different thrust levels for attitude or velocity control, as for maneuvering during docking with other spacecraft.

On space vehicles with two sizes of attitude control thrusters, the main ACS (Attitude Control System) thrusters are used for larger movements, while the verniers are reserved for smaller adjustments.

Due to their weight and the extra plumbing required for their operation, vernier rockets are seldom used in new designs.&lt;ref name=nasa20111230&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Instead, as modern rocket engines gained better control, larger thrusters could also be fired for very short pulses, resulting in the same change of [[momentum]] as a longer thrust from a smaller thruster.

Vernier thrusters are used in rockets such as the [[R-7 (rocket family)|R-7]] for vehicle maneuvering because the main engine is fixed in place. For earlier versions of the [[Atlas rocket]] family (prior to the Atlas III), in addition to maneuvering, the verniers were used for roll control, although the booster engines could also perform this function. After sustainer engine cutoff, the verniers would execute solo mode and fire for several seconds to make fine adjustments to the vehicle attitude. The Thor/Delta family also used verniers for roll control, but were mounted on the base of the thrust section flanking the main engine.

== Examples ==
[[File:Soyuz rocket engines.jpg|thumbnail|right|The first and second-stage engines of a [[Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz]], showing the four [[RD-107]] modules with twin vernier nozzles each, and the central RD-108 with four steerable vernier thrusters.]]

* The [[R-7 family|R-7 rocket family]], with over 1700 successful launches to date, still depends on the S1.358000 vernier thusters in its first and second stage. Most of the larger Soviet missiles and launch vehicles also used verniers. Examples include the [[RD-8]] on the [[Zenit (rocket family)|Zenit rocket family]], the [[RD-855]] and [[RD-856]] on the [[R-36 (missile)|R-36]], and the [[RD-0214]] on the [[Proton (rocket family)|Proton rocket family]].
* On the [[Atlas (rocket family)|SM-65 Atlas]], the LR-101 verniers were used for roll control and to fine-tune the vehicle attitude after main engine cutoff. The [[Delta II]] and [[Delta III]] rocket also used the LR-101 for vehicle roll maneuver since one engine cannot do a roll maneuver (although the later [[GEM 46]] had thrust vectoring nozzle, only three were equipped with this feature and only ignited a brief moment during the ascent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LR-101 VERNIER ENGINE|url=http://heroicrelics.org/info/lr-101/lr-101.html|website=heroicrelics.org|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Space Shuttle]] [[reaction control system]] had six vernier engines or thrusters in its ''VRCS'' or "Vernier Reaction Control System" . The system could also deliver a gentle steady thrust which was regularly used to reboost the [[International Space Station]] while docked. For example, during [[STS-130]] commander [[George D. Zamka|George Zamka]] and pilot [[Terry W. Virts|Terry Virts]] fired ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'''s VRCS for a duration of 33 minutes to attain an orbit between 180.5 and 190.0&amp;nbsp;[[Nautical mile|nmi]].&lt;ref name=nasaRCS&gt;

'''''You Belong to Me: Sex, Race and Murder in the South''''' is a 2015 American [[documentary film]] produced by Hilary Saltzman, Kitty Potapow, and Jude Hagin and directed by [[John Cork]].&lt;ref name="Ocala Style Magazine"/&gt; The film works to uncover the hidden truths of the [[Ruby McCollum]] case of 1952. McCollum, the richest African American woman in [[Suwannee County, Florida]], shot White physician and politician Clifford Leroy Adams four times with her revolver.

Hagin discovered this story when meeting with the late Dr. [[James Haskins]], award-winning author and English professor at [[The University of Florida]]. Haskins provided Hagin with a copy of the [[William Bradford Huie]] book [[Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail]], saying “this story needs to be told.” Upon reading Huie’s book, Hagin disagreed with the assertion that McCollum had been in a consensual, sexual relationship with Adams and that the Adams shooting was over a money dispute. “I could not get that into my head,” she said. “I could not wrap my head around the notion that an African-American woman in 1952 would willingly have a relationship with a town’s sainted physician.”&lt;ref name="Ocala Style Magazine"/&gt;

Hagin’s pursuit of the truth led to an exploration of “[[paramour rights]],” the assumption that White men had the right to use Black women for sex, in the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] South. While there had been previous books and documentaries on Ruby McCollum, '''''You Belong to Me: Sex, Race and Murder in the South''''' is the first project to get witness accounts, including interviews with McCollum’s friends and family and the last surviving juror from the trial.&lt;ref name="Tampa Bay Times"&gt;{{cite news|author= Paul Guzzo |title= Pinellas film producers revisit 1952 Live Oak slaying |url= http://tbo.com/pinellas-county/pinellas-producers-revisit-1952-murder-case-20141128/|newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|date= November 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I wanted to get family members on both sides to tell their side of the story," Hagin said.&lt;ref name="Associated Press"&gt;{{cite news|author= Jason Dearen |title= Jim Crow-era shooting revisited in new documentary |url= http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-jim-crow-era-shooting-revisited-in-new-documentary-2015jan01-story.html|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|date= January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film premiered at the 2014 LA Femme International Film Festival on October 17, 2014&lt;ref name=" LA Femme International Film Festival 2014"/&gt; and was released for [[Video on demand|VOD]] on February 1, 2015 in time for [[Black History Month]].&lt;ref name="Ocala Style Magazine"/&gt;

==Summary==
On the morning of August 3rd, 1952, Ruby McCollum left her children in her car and walked into the “colored entrance” of Dr. Clifford Leroy Adams’ office and shot him four times into his body. The White doctor and state Senator-elect died on the scene while McCollum returned home to warm milk for her baby.&lt;ref name="Associated Press"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YBTM excerpts"&gt;{{cite web|title=About You Belong to Me|url=http://www.youbelongtome.net/excerpts/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors claimed that McCollum shot Dr. Adams in a dispute over a $116 medical bill, despite the fact that she had $1,800 in her purse and was the wealthiest Black woman in town. The judge ordered the jury to disregard McCollum’s testimony that Dr. Adams repeatedly [[rape|raped]] her and that the shooting was in [[self-defense]]. In fact, Dr. Adams fathered a daughter by McCollum, but the jury was not allowed to even look at her when she was presented as evidence of the rape. McCollum was found guilty and sentenced to death. Years later, she won an insanity plea and was released from prison in 1974.&lt;ref name="Associated Press"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YBTM excerpts"/&gt;

The documentary uses first-hand accounts of both the McCollum and Adams families as well as the last living juror in an attempt to uncover the truth behind the murder. Was McCollum actually insane or was she truly acting in self-defense after years of rape? '''''You Belong to Me: Sex, Race and Murder in the South''''' looks at previous conclusions and offers up its own in an effort to answer that question.

==Reception==
The film received mostly positive response from critics. Mike Spain of Irish Film Critic gave it 4 out of 5 stars and wrote, “There is plenty to the story to keep the interest of the audience. One of the film’s strengths is a lot of the story is told by people who were in Live Oak at the time or had a stake in the outcome. A juror, town’s people, and Ruby’s relatives. It adds to the authenticity of the documentary.”&lt;ref name="Irish Film Critic"&gt;{{cite news|author= Mike Spain|title= Movie Review: “You Belong To Me: Sex, Race And Murder In The South” Reveal Forgotten Sins |url= http://irishfilmcritic.com/movie-review-you-belong-to-me/|website=[[Irish Film Critic]]|date= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her review for Emertainment Monthly, Emily Solomon graded the film with an A- and wrote, “What is so intriguing about the way this film is put together is how the mystery unravels. The murder is established early on in the film, with new twists and turns revealed throughout that shows McCollum’s motivation to commit in the first place.”&lt;ref name="Emertainment Monthly"&gt;{{cite news|author= Emily Solomon|title= Boston Film Fest Review: ‘You Belong to Me’ Unveils a Relevant Piece of History |url= http://emertainmentmonthly.com/index.php/boston-film-fest-review-you-belong-to-me-unveils-a-relevant-piece-of-history/|website=[[Emertainment Monthly]]|date= September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
