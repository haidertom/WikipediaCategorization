To these descriptions, one can also add the Kantian notion of the wrongness of using another human being as means to an end rather than as ends in themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychodynamic Perspectives on Abuse: The Cost of Fear|last=McCluskey|first=Una|last2=Hooper|first2=Carol-Ann|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year=2000|isbn=1853026859|location=London|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources describe abuse as "socially constructed", which means there may be more or less recognition of the suffering of a victim at different times and societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Child Neglect and Emotional Abuse: Understanding, Assessment and Response|last=Doyle|first=Celia|last2=Timms|first2=Charles|publisher=SAGE|year=2014|isbn=9780857022301|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and contexts of abuse==

===Abuse of authority===

Abuse of authority, in the form of political corruption, is the use of legislated or otherwise authorised powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as [[Political repression|repression]] of political opponents and general [[police brutality]], is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties.

Abuse of authority is separated from [[abuse of power]] in that the act is originally condoned, but is extended beyond that initially conceived and is in not all cases

==={{Anchor|Ad hominem abuse}} Ad hominem abuse===
{{Main|Ad hominem abuse}}

===Adolescent abuse===
:''See: [[Anti-social behaviour]], [[Juvenile delinquency]], [[Parental abuse by adolescents]], [[Parental abuse of adolescents]]''

===Adult abuse===
Adult abuse refers to the abuse of [[Vulnerability|vulnerable]] adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/adultawstaff.pdf |format=PDF |title=Adult abuse |accessdate=5 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211200952/http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/adultawstaff.pdf |archivedate=11 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol abuse===
{{Main|Alcohol abuse}}
Alcohol abuse, as described in the [[DSM-IV]], is a psychiatric diagnosis describing the recurring use of [[alcoholic beverage]]s despite its negative consequences.&lt;ref name="pubs.niaaa"&gt;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. [http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa30.htm "Diagnostic Criteria for Alcohol Abuse and Dependence"] ''Alcohol Alert,'' No. 30 PH 359, October 1995.&lt;!--Retrieved 17 August 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol abuse is sometimes referred to by the less specific term [[alcoholism]]. However, many definitions of alcoholism exist, and only some are compatible with alcohol abuse. There are two types of alcoholics: those who have anti social and pleasure-seeking tendencies, and those who are anxiety-ridden- people who are able to go without drinking for long periods of time but are unable to control themselves once they start.&lt;ref name="Neil R 2010, p.572"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carlson, Neil R. |author2=Heth, C. Donald |title=Psychology: The Science of Behaviour |publisher=Pearson Canada Inc. |year=2010 |page=572}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Binge drinking]] is another form of alcohol abuse. Frequent binge drinking or getting severely drunk more than twice is classed as alcohol misuse.&lt;ref name="Michaud-2007"&gt;{{cite journal | date=February 2007 | first1=PA. | last1=Michaud | title=Alcohol misuse in adolescents – a challenge for general practitioners | journal=Ther Umsch | volume=64 | issue=2 | pages=121–6 | doi=10.1024/0040-5930.64.2.121 | pmid=17245680}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research done through international surveys, the heaviest drinkers happen to be the United Kingdom's adolescent generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McArdle |first=Paul |title=Alcohol abuse in adolescents |journal=[[Archives of Disease in Childhood]] |date=27 February 2008 |volume=93 |issue=6| doi = 10.1136/adc.2007.115840 |pages=524–527 |pmid=18305075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal abuse===
{{Main|Cruelty to animals}}
{{See also|:Category:Cruelty to animals}}
Animal abuse is the infliction of [[suffering]] or [[harm]] upon animals, other than [[human]]s, for purposes other than self-defense. More narrowly, it can be harm for specific gain, such as killing animals for fur. Diverging viewpoints are held by jurisdictions throughout the world.

===Anti-social behavior===
{{Main|Anti-social behavior}}
{{See also|Incivility}}
Anti-social behavior is often seen as public [[behavior]] that lacks judgement and consideration for others and may damage them or their property. It may be intentional, as with [[vandalism]] or [[graffiti]], or the result of [[negligence]]. Persistent anti-social behavior may be a manifestation of an [[antisocial personality disorder]]. The counterpart of anti-social behavior is [[social behavior|pro-social behavior]], namely any behavior intended to help or benefit another person, group or society.&lt;ref&gt;

It typically involves subtle methods of [[coercion]] such as [[intimidation]]. Bullying can be defined in many different ways. Although the UK currently has no legal definition of bullying,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=2755 |title=The University of Manchester : Dignity at Work and Study Procedure for Students |publisher=Documents.manchester.ac.uk |accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; some US states have laws against it.

{{Main|Character assassination}}
Character assassination is an attempt to tarnish a person's [[reputation]].

{{Main|Child abuse}}
{{See also|Category:Child abuse|Child neglect}}
Child abuse is the physical or psychological/emotional mistreatment of children. In the United States, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) define child maltreatment as any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/dvp/CMP/CMP-Surveillance.htm |accessdate=20 October 2008 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |title=Child Maltreatment Surveillance: Uniform Definitions for Public Health and Recommended Data Elements |date=1 January 2008 |author1=Leeb, R.T. |author2=Paulozzi, L.J. |author3=Melanson, C. |author4=Simon, T.R. |author5=Arias, I. |lastauthoramp=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016225901/http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/dvp/CMP/CMP-Surveillance.htm |archivedate=16 October 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most child abuse occurs in a child's home, with a smaller amount occurring in the organisations, schools or communities the child interacts with. There are four major categories of child abuse: [[neglect]], [[physical abuse]], [[psychological abuse|psychological/emotional abuse]], and [[sexual abuse]].

It has been noted that [[disabled]] people are disproportionately affected by disability abuse and [[bullying]], and such activity has been cited as a [[hate crime]].&lt;ref name=Quarmby&gt;{{cite book |last=Quarmby |first=Katharine |title=Scapegoat: Why we are failing disabled people |publisher=Portobello |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bullying is not limited to those who are visibly disabled – such as wheelchair-users or individuals with physical deformities (e.g., [[cleft lip]]) – but also those with [[learning disabilities]] such as [[autism]]&lt;ref name=Sainsbury&gt;{{cite book |last=Sainsbury |first=Clare |title=Martian in the Playground: Understanding the schoolchild with Asperger's syndrome |publisher=Paul Chapman Publishing |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Attwood&gt;{{cite book |last=Attwood |first=Tony |title=The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome |publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers |year=2007 |pages=95–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[developmental coordination disorder]].&lt;ref name=Kirby&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirby |first=Amanda |title=Dyspraxia: The Hidden Handicap |publisher=Souvenir Press |year=1999 |pages=106–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brookes&gt;{{cite book |last=Brookes |first=Geoff |title=Dyspraxia |publisher=Continuum 2005 |pages=43–46 |isbn=0826475817 |chapter=8: Dyspraxia in the Preschool and Nursery}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, this is linked to a poor ability in physical education, and this behaviour can be encouraged by an ignorant physical education teacher. Abuse of the disabled is not limited to schools; there are many known cases in which the disabled have been abused by staff of a "care institution", such as the case revealed in a [[BBC]] [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]] programme on a Castlebeck care home ([[Winterbourne View]]) near [[Bristol, England|Bristol]], leading to its closure and suspension or firing of staff members.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news

===Discriminatory abuse===
{{Main|Discrimination|:Category:Discrimination| Template:Discrimination|Template:Discrimination sidebar|Prejudice|Religious discrimination}}
Discriminatory abuse involves picking on or treating someone unfairly because something about them is different; for example concerning:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* [[ageism|age]]
* clothing or appearance
* [[ethnic discrimination|ethnicity]], nationality or culture including traits like [[language]]
* [[Sexism|gender]], including gender-related traits (e.g., Pregnancy)
* health (such as HIV/AIDS) or [[disability]] (e.g., [[mental disorders]])
* [[language]] usage
* lifestyle or occupation
* [[racism|race]] or skin colour
* [[religious persecution|religion]] or political affiliation
* [[Homophobia|sexuality]] and [[sexual orientation]]
* social class or creed
* weight or height
}}

Discriminatory laws such as [[redlining]] have existed in many countries. In some countries, controversial attempts such as [[racial quota]]s have been used to redress negative effects of discrimination.

Other acts of discrimination include [[political libel]], [[defamation]] of groups and [[stereotype]]s based on [[exaggeration]]s.

Domestic abuse can be broadly defined as any form of abusive behaviours by one or both partners in an [[intimate relationship]], such as marriage, cohabitation, family, dating, or even friends. It is important to remember that abuse is always intentional, and can not happen by accident.
Domestic violence has many forms, including:
* physical aggression (hitting, kicking, biting, shoving, restraining, throwing objects), or threats thereof
* [[sexual abuse]]
* [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]]
* financial abuse (withholding money or controlling all money, including that of other family members)
* social abuse (restricting access to friends and/or family, insulting or threatening friends and/or family), controlling or domineering
* [[intimidation]]
* [[stalking]]

===Flag abuse===
{{Main|Flag desecration}}
Flag abuse (or flag desecration) is a term applied to various acts that intentionally destroy, damage or mutilate a flag in public, most often a national flag. Often, such action is intended to make a political point against a country or its policies. Some countries have laws forbidding methods of destruction (such as burning in public) or forbidding particular uses (such as for commercial purposes); such laws may distinguish between desecration of the country's own national flag and flags of other countries. Countries may have laws protecting the right to burn a flag as free speech.

In some cases criminal or [[anti-social behavior]] occurs when the person is under the influence of a drug, and long term personality changes in individuals may occur as well.&lt;ref name=Ksir&gt;{{cite book|last=Ksir|first=Oakley Ray; Charles|title=Drugs, society, and human behavior|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston [u.a.]|isbn=0072319631|edition=9th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFBHAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=antisocial}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to possible physical, social, and psychological harm, use of some drugs may also lead to criminal penalties, although these vary widely depending on the local jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="mosby"&gt;(2002).

===Surveillance abuse===
{{Main|Surveillance abuse}}
Surveillance abuse is the use of [[surveillance]] methods or technology to monitor the activity of an individual or group of individuals in a way which violates the [[social norm]]s or laws of a society. [[Mass surveillance]] by the state may constitute surveillance abuse if not appropriately regulated. Surveillance abuse often falls outside the scope of [[lawful interception]]. It is illegal because it violates peoples' [[right to privacy]].

===Taunting===
{{Main|Taunting}}
A taunt is a [[battle cry]], a method in hand-to-hand combat, sarcastic remark, or [[insult]] intended to demoralise the recipient, or to anger them and encourage reactionary behaviours without thinking. Taunting can exist as a form of social competition to gain control of the target's [[cultural capital]] (i.e. [[social status|status]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} In [[sociological]] theory, the control of the three social capitals{{refn|Economic capital, cultural capital, and social capital, according to sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Forms of Capital|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/bourdieu-forms-capital.htm|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=11 March 2014|author =Pierre Bourdieu|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} is used to produce an advantage in the social hierarchy as to enforce one's own position in relation to others. Taunting is committed by either directly [[bullying]], or indirectly encouraging others to bully the target. It is also possible to give a response of the same kind, to ensure one's own status. It can be compared to [[fighting words]] and [[trash-talk]].

===Teasing===
{{Main|Teasing}}
Teasing is a word with many meanings. In human interactions, teasing comes in two major forms, ''playful'' and ''hurtful''. In mild cases, and especially when it is reciprocal, teasing can be viewed as playful and friendly.
However, teasing is often unwelcome and then it takes the form of [[harassment]]. In extreme cases, teasing may escalate to actual violence, and may even result in abuse. Children are commonly teased on such matters as their [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], weight, [[behaviour]], [[Skill|abilities]], and clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0146167200264009 | last1 = Kowalski | first1 = R. | year = 2000 | title = I was only kidding:Victim and perpetrators' perceptions of teasing | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 231–241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of teasing is often hurtful, even when the teaser believes he or she is being playful. One may also tease an animal. Some animals, such as dogs and cats, may recognise this as play; but in humans, teasing can become hurtful and take the form of [[bullying]] and abuse.

It is sometimes sponsored by state policies when a country is not able to prove itself militarily to another enemy country.

===Transgender abuse or trans bashing===
{{Main|Trans bashing}}
Trans bashing is the act of [[victimising]] a person physically, sexually, or verbally because they are [[transgender]] or [[Transsexualism|transsexual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20774504-5005961,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502173830/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C20774504-5005961%2C00.html |archivedate=2 May 2008 |date=17 November 2006 |author=Mariza O'Keefe |work=Herald Sun |title=Guilty plea over transsexual bashing |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[gay bashing]], it is committed because of the target's actual or perceived [[gender identity]], not [[sexual orientation]].

===Umpire abuse===
{{Main|Umpire abuse}}
Umpire abuse refers to the act of abuse towards a [[umpire]], referee, or other official in sport. The abuse can be [[verbal abuse]] (such as [[namecalling]]), or [[physical abuse]] (such as punching).

===Verbal abuse or verbal attacks===
{{Main|Verbal abuse}}
Verbal abuse is a form of abusive behaviour involving the use of [[language]]. It is a form of [[profanity]] that can occur with or without the use of [[Expletive attributive|expletives]]. While oral communication is the most common form of verbal abuse, it also includes abusive words in written form.

Verbal abuse is a pattern of behaviour that can seriously interfere with one's positive emotional development and can lead to significant detriment to one's [[self-esteem]], emotional [[Quality of life|well-being]], and physical state. It has been further described as an ongoing emotional environment organised by the abuser for the purposes of control.

===Whispering campaign===
{{Main|Whispering campaign}}
A whispering campaign is a method of [[persuasion]] in which damaging rumours or innuendo are spread about the target, while the source of the rumours seeks to avoid being detected while spreading them (for example, a political campaign might distribute anonymous flyers attacking the other candidate).

Workplace bullying, like [[childhood]] [[bullying]], is the tendency of individuals or groups to use persistent aggressive or unreasonable behaviour against a co-worker. Workplace bullying can include such tactics as [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[nonverbal]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], [[physical abuse]] and [[humiliation]]. This type of [[aggression]] is particularly difficult because unlike the typical forms of [[school bullying]], workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organisation and their society.

== Abusive power and control ==
{{Main|Abusive power and control}}
{{See also|Coercive power}}
Abusive power and control (or controlling behaviour or coercive control) is the way that abusers gain and maintain [[Power (social and political)|power]] and control over a victim for an [[abusive]] purpose such as [[psychological abuse|psychological]], [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], or [[financial abuse|financial]] abuse. The abuse can be for various reasons such as personal gain, personal [[gratification]], [[psychological projection]], [[Idealization and devaluation|devaluation]], [[envy]], or just for the sake of it as the abuser may simply enjoy exercising power and control.

Controlling abusers may use multiple tactics to exert power and control over their victims. The tactics themselves are psychologically and sometimes physically abusive. Control may be helped through [[Economic abuse#Controlling mechanism|economic abuse]] thus limiting the victim's actions as they may then lack the necessary resources to resist the abuse.&lt;ref name=wdachoices&gt;[http://wdachoices.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WDAH_flipchart_money_wheel.pdf ''Economic abuse wheel''].

[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulators]] and abusers control their victims with a range of tactics, including [[positive reinforcement]] (such as [[praise]], [[superficial charm]], [[flattery]], [[ingratiation]], [[love bombing]], [[smiling]], [[gift]]s, attention), [[negative reinforcement]], intermittent or partial reinforcement, [[Punishment (psychology)|psychological punishment]] (such as [[nagging]], [[silent treatment]], [[profanity|swearing]], threats, [[intimidation]], [[emotional blackmail]], [[guilt trip]]s, inattention) and traumatic tactics (such as [[verbal abuse]] or [[explosive anger]]).&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ?

In their review of data from the [[Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study]] (a longitudinal birth cohort study; n = 941) Moffitt et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Moffitt, T.E. |author2=Caspi, A. |author3=Rutter, M. |author4=Silva, P.A. |year=2001 |title=Sex differences in antisocial behavior: Conduct Disorder, Delinquency, and Violence in the Dunedin Longitudinal Study |publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; report that while men exhibit more aggression overall, gender is not a reliable predictor of interpersonal aggression, including psychological aggression. The study found that whether male or female, aggressive people share a cluster of traits, including high rates of suspicion and jealousy; sudden and drastic mood swings; poor self-control; and higher than average rates of approval of violence and aggression (in American society, females are, on average, excused when violent against males). Moffitt et al. also argue that [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] men exhibit two distinct types of interpersonal aggression (one against strangers, the other against intimate female partners), while antisocial women are rarely aggressive against anyone other than intimate male partners.

'''Aesthetic emotions''' are [[emotions]] that are felt during [[aesthetic]] activity or appreciation. These emotions may be of the everyday variety (such as [[fear]], [[wonder (emotion)|wonder]] or [[sympathy]]) or may be specific to aesthetic contexts. Examples of the latter include the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], the [[beauty|beautiful]], and the [[kitsch]]. In each of these respects, the emotion usually constitutes only a part of the overall aesthetic experience, but may play a more or less definitive function for that state.

==Types==

===Visual arts and film===
The relation between aesthetic emotions and other emotions is traditionally said to rely on the disinterestedness of the aesthetic experience (see [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] especially). Aesthetic emotions do not motivate practical behaviours in the way that other emotions do (such as fear motivating avoidance behaviours).

The capacity of artworks to arouse emotions such as fear is a subject of philosophical and psychological research.&lt;ref name="research programme"&gt;[http://www.affective-sciences.org/aesthetic-emotions Aesthetic emotions | Swiss Center for Affective Sciences&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113185956/http://www.affective-sciences.org/aesthetic-emotions |date=January 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It raises problems such as the [[paradox of fiction]] in which one responds with sometimes quite intense emotions to art, even whilst knowing that the scenario presented is fictional (see for instance the work of [[Kendall Walton]]). Another issue is the problem of [[imaginative resistance]], which considers why we are able to imagine many far-fetched fictional truths but experience comparative difficulty imagining that different moral standards hold in a fictional world. This problem was first raised by [[David Hume]], and was revived in current discussion by [[Richard Moran (philosopher)|Richard Moran]], [[Kendall Walton]] and [[Tamar Gendler]] (who introduced the term in its current usage in a 2000 article by the same name).&lt;ref&gt;Tamar Szabó Gendler (2000). The Puzzle of Imaginative Resistance. Journal of Philosophy 97 (2):55-81&lt;/ref&gt; Some  forms of artwork seem to be dedicated to the arousal of particular emotions. For instance [[horror films]] seek to arouse feelings of fear or disgust; [[comedies]] seek to arouse amusement or happiness, [[tragedies]] seek to arouse sympathy or sadness, and [[melodrama]]s try to arouse pity and empathy.

===Music===
In the [[philosophy of music]], scholars have argued whether instrumental music such as symphonies are simply abstract arrangements and patterns of musical pitches ("[[absolute music]]"), or whether instrumental music depicts emotional tableaux and moods ("[[program music]]"). Despite the assertions of philosophers advocating the "absolute music" argument, the typical symphony-goer does interpret the notes and chords of the orchestra emotionally; the opening of a Romantic-era symphony, in which minor chords thunder over low bass notes is often interpreted by layperson listeners as an expression of sadness in music.

Also called "abstract music", absolute music is music that is not explicitly "about" anything, non-representational or non-objective. Absolute music has no references to stories or images or any other kind of extramusical idea. The aesthetic ideas underlying the absolute music debate relate to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s aesthetic disinterestedness from his ''Critique of Aesthetic Judgment'', and has led to numerous arguments, including a war of words between [[Brahms]] and [[Wagner]]. In the 19th century, a group of early Romantics including [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]  and [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] gave rise to the idea of what can be labeled as spiritual absolutism. "Formalism" is the concept of ‘music for music’s sake’ and refers only to instrumental music without words. The 19th century music critic [[Eduard Hanslick]] argued that music could be enjoyed as pure sound and form, that it needed no connotation of extra-musical elements to warrant its existence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2551">An '''assisted person''' has several meanings in law, referring generally to [[indigent]] people.

Under [[Great Britain]] [[statutory law]], one who is eligible for [[Legal aid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrothgar.co.uk/YAWS/rules/part43.htm English legal web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221064001/http://www.hrothgar.co.uk/YAWS/rules/part43.htm |date=February 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880034_en_5.htm Legal Aid Act] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518004854/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880034_en_5.htm |date=May 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also refers to such a person under [[Scottish law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jonathanmitchell.info/legalaid/chapter10.htm private law firm site], citing Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[United States|U.S.]] [[Bankruptcy law]], it is also a person who applies to a [[debt relief]] agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|11|526}} (a) [http://doney.net/bkcode/11usc0526.htm Bankruptcy law site]&lt;/ref&gt;  A debt relief agency is "any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration, or who is a bankruptcy petition preparer" under {{UnitedStatesCode|11|110}}.

'''Bike rage''' refers to acts of verbal or gestural anger or physical aggression between [[cyclists]] and other users of bike paths or roadways, including pedestrians, other cyclists, motorcyclists, or drivers. Bike rage can consist of shouting at other road users, making obscene gestures or threats, hitting or punching, or in rare cases, even more violent acts. The term can refer either to acts committed by cyclists&lt;ref name=Montogomery2008&gt;{{cite web|first=Charles |last=Montogomery |date=July 1, 2008 |title=Bike Rage |work=Momentum |url=http://momentummag.com/features/bike-rage/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220214828/http://momentummag.com/features/bike-rage/ |archivedate=2013-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by drivers.&lt;ref name=Creagh2008&gt;{{cite news |first=Sunanda |last=Creagh |date=August 2, 2008 |title=Sydney's drivers 'worst' for bike rage |work=The Sydney Morning Herald

==Causes==
[[File:Traffic jam Rio de Janeiro 03 2008 28.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Some transportation experts argue that traffic congestion may be a contributing factor to driver frustration and bike rage.]]
A bike rage incident can start because a cyclist, driver, or pedestrian believes that another road user was being discourteous, breaking traffic rules, or in many cases because someone felt that their safety was being compromised by the actions of another road user. According to University of Hawaii professor of psychology Leon James, "bike rage is a common occurrence, and quite predictable", because urban commuting causes "tension, anxiety, and anger – in drivers as well as cyclists".&lt;ref name=Montogomery2008/&gt; Montogomery claims some cyclists hit cars using a "classic U-lock bash-and-run" tactic. He argues that "some cyclists consider such attacks acts of driver education". Montogomery claims the "...problem is that city planners have mixed bikes and cars together in ways that offer little certainty about how each should operate, and lots of chances for conflict". As such, "cyclists feel threatened in traffic" and "...hard done by and under attack."&lt;ref name=Montogomery2008/&gt;
 
An article in ''Toronto Life'' magazine argues that the "...source of the problem [bike and road rage] is neither the arrogance of drivers nor the militancy of cyclists, but the environment in which they interact." The article claims that the "...urban grid, already congested with cars, is being flooded with cyclists...intensifying competition for road space." One issue is that "[d]rivers are not sufficiently alert to the presence and the quickness of cyclists". A possible explanation for all of the aggression that occurs between cyclists and drivers is the anonymity of the big city: "...they know they will never run into that person again."&lt;ref name="torontolife.com"&gt;All the Rage
The tension between drivers and cyclists has escalated to swearing, punching, bird-flipping hysteria. City hall thinks additional bike lanes will calm everybody down. What if they’re wrong? By Philip Preville. In ''Toronto Life'' magazine. Available at: http://www.torontolife.com/features/all-rage/?pageno=1&lt;/ref&gt;

A member of the S.F. Bicycle Coalition argues that "Road rage is a symptom of a contradiction between the image and promise of cars and the reality," because "You never see a car ad showing someone stuck in traffic." After an altercation between cyclists and police, an observer noted that "The sheep -- like the man who was just riding to the gym and decided to join and have a little fun -- were bewildered, angry, defiant. Turned into wolves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/july97/news/news2970730.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307074318/http://www.salon.com/july97/news/news2970730.html |date=March 7, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 ''New York Times'' article stated that "...overwhelmingly, on blogs and Web sites nationwide, drivers and cyclists routinely describe shouted epithets, flung water bottles, sprays of spit and harrowing near-misses of the intentional kind." The article noted that there is "a whiff of class warfare in the simmering hostility, too. During morning rush, the teeth-gritting of drivers is almost audible, as superbly fit cyclists, wearing Sharpie-toned spandex and riding $3,000 bikes, cockily dart through the swampy, stolid traffic to offices with bike racks and showers."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/fashion/10bikewars.html|title=Moving Targets|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 8, 2008|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bike rage may also be caused by confusion about how the rules of the road apply to cyclists. In some jurisdictions, cyclists are allowed to ride on the sidewalk, whereas in other places, this is against the law. In all fifty U.S. states, bicycles are classified as vehicles and cyclists have many of the same rights and responsibilities as other drivers&lt;ref&gt;https://bikeleague.org/content/traffic-laws&lt;/ref&gt;; however, other jurisdictions may place restrictions on where citizens may operate bicycles. These differences in rules may lead drivers to believe that a cyclist is violating the law by cycling on a roadway, even if local laws require cyclists to be on the road. Many citizens are also ignorant of their localities' laws concerning bicycles.  {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Examples==

===Drivers attacking cyclists===
In Toronto in January 2006, a driver tossed his lunch out the window of his car in a traffic jam. A 26-year-old bike courier threw the food back into the car. The driver tossed two cups of hot coffee at the courier, and then, after they exchanged insults, the driver attacked the woman and her bike.&lt;ref name="torontolife.com" /&gt;
[[Image:SaoPaulo PrestesMaia.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Urban land use is often dominated by automobiles. Pictured: [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].]]
In 2009 in Los Angeles, a 59-year-old man was "charged with two felony counts each of reckless driving causing injury, battery with serious bodily injury and the special allegation of causing great bodily injury". After the man had an argument with two cyclists, he "allegedly stopped short and caused one [bike] rider to go through the rear window of Dr. Thompson's Infiniti and other rider to crash onto the pavement. The driver, who admitted slamming on his brakes, was later sentenced to 10 years in prison."&lt;ref&gt;Brentwood driver charged in bike rage
Kevin Roderick • July 11, 2008. Available at: http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2008/07/brentwood_driver_charged.php&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''New York Times'' story stated a 41-year-old cyclist, Dan Cooley was injured by a driver who became angry at him after an exchange of swear words. The incident began when the driver came out of a driveway in front of Mr. Cooley. Angered, Mr. Cooley cursed at the driver, who responded in kind. As Mr. Cooley moved off the road, the car drove into him, and knocked him to the ground with the vehicle, and then the driver got out of the car and attacked him, leaving him with a concussion and a torn ligament. Mr. Cooley thinks that the anger between cyclists and drivers might be due to the relatively new arrival of bikes on city streets: “We’ve had a [[car culture]] for so long and suddenly the roads become saturated with bicyclists trying to save gas"; however, he added,“No one knows how to share the road.”&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

According to the ''UK Guardian'', a cyclist named Jefferey Guffey from Indiana told a driver to slow down. The driver attacked Guffey and bit part of his ear off. After the incident, police charged the attacker with battery. In Oxford, "police investigated a spate of attacks on cyclists motivated, apparently, by hatred of bicycles and their riders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/5171552.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Oxfordshire &amp;#124; Drivers accused of cycle rage |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Wolmar]], an international expert on transportation, stated that Sydney "drivers are more hostile towards cyclists than motorists of any other country".&lt;ref name=Creagh2008/&gt;

===Cyclists attacking drivers===
In Toronto in 2007, "... after being cut off by a driver just after morning rush hour in Toronto, a cyclist caught up to the car, reached inside the window, and stabbed the driver in the face and neck with a screwdriver."&lt;ref name=Montogomery2008/&gt;

A 2004 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' article states that a Pennsylvania bicyclist shot a truck driver in the arm after an altercation. The truck driver, William Nicoletti, 51, drove past the cyclist, who made an obscene gesture. Mr. Nicoletti stated that when he turned his truck around and drove toward the cyclist, man on the bike drew a pistol and shot Mr. Nicoletti. The man on the bicycle, Robert Urick, 41, was "charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault and weapons offenses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |date=February 10, 2004 |title=Bike rage: Cyclist allegedly insults, shoots driver |work=Chicago Sun-Times |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1517999.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 ''Newsweek'' article entitled "Pedal vs. Metal: A surge in bike ridership spurs a new kind of road rage" described an altercation which began after a driver named Patrick Schrepping told cyclist Adam Leckie to wear a helmet. Following this conversation, Leckie "allegedly responded by keying Schrepping's car", and then Schrepping struck Leckie with a metal object. Both men were arrested and charged with assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/149224 |title=Road Rage in Portland: Bikes, Cars Clash |publisher=Newsweek |date=July 27, 2008 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael J. Bryant]] (born April 13, 1966) is a former public administrator and former [[politician]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] who was involved in an incident with a cyclist. After an altercation with a cyclist on August 31, 2009, in which Bryant's car struck a bike courier, Bryant was charged with criminal negligence causing death and [[Causing death by dangerous driving|dangerous driving causing death]]. On May 25, 2010, all charges against Bryant were withdrawn, with prosecutors describing the cyclist as the aggressor in the incident.&lt;ref name="Withdrawn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/charges-against-bryant-in-fatal-crash-withdrawn-1.898818|title=Charges against Bryant in fatal crash withdrawn |last=|first=|accessdate=2014-05-26|newspaper=CBC News | date=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyclists attacking cyclists===

Bike rage does not only involve altercations between drivers and cyclists. In some cases, there have been fights between cyclists. In an incident in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], a 51-year-old cyclist suggested to a 28-year-old cyclist that he should get a bike light so that others could see him. After hearing this comment, the younger cyclist felt "extremely insulted" and allegedly tried to force the older man off the road. The 51-year-old was followed to his home, at which point the 28-year-old "clamped his hands around O'Brien's head" and then "... twisted O'Brien to the ground and kicked him in the ribs." Police indicated that they planned to charge the younger man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christians |first=Lindsay |url=http://www.madison.com/tct/news/stories/317158 |title=Cap Times : Ct |publisher=Madison.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3248">'''Cadena temporal''' and '''cadena perpetua''' were legal punishments. Cadena temporal included imprisonment for at least 12 years and one day, in chains, at hard and painful labor; the loss of many basic civil rights; and subjection to lifetime surveillance. Cadena perpetua is identical except that it is a sentence of life as opposed to a temporary status.

The "title" of the punishment is actually descriptive, as ''cadena'' is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word meaning chain&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spanishdict.com/AS.cfm?e=cadena&lt;/ref&gt; while temporal means impermanent or temporary, in addition to the meaning it shares with English&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spanishdict.com/AS.cfm?e=temporal&lt;/ref&gt; and ''perpetua'', means continuous in [[latin (language)|Latin]] and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/cgi-bin/aglimpse-latin/16/www/Lexis/Latin?query=perpetua&amp;case=on&amp;whole=on&amp;errors=0&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=December 2009}}

One of the places these punishments were provided for was the [[Philippine]] legal system. This was a result of the Spanish Penal Code of 1870, which was adopted due to the country having been a Spanish colony until 1898. Cadena temporal was among the penalties repealed in 1932 with the enactment of the [[Revised Penal Code of the Philippines]].

The use of this colonial punishment has been reviewed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Weems v. United States]]'', 217 U.S. 349 (1910).&lt;ref&gt;http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=217&amp;invol=349&lt;/ref&gt; Derived from the Spanish penal Code, the punishment of "cadena temporal" was from twelve years and one day to twenty years (arts. 28 and 96), which 'shall be served' in certain '[[Prison|penal institutions]].' And it was provided that 'those sentenced to cadena temporal (and cadena perpetua) shall labor for the benefit of the state. They shall always carry a chain at the ankle, hanging from the wrists; they shall be employed at hard and painful labor, and shall receive no assistance whatsoever from without the institution.'  There were, besides, certain accessory penalties imposed with it.

In Weems, the Supreme Court ruled this punishment to be "[[cruel and unusual punishment|cruel and unusual]]" for a crime of "corruptly, and with intent then and there to deceive and defraud the United States government of the Philippine Islands and its officials, falsify[ing] a public and official document." ''Weems v. United'' States breaks away with the "[[Originalism|historic method]]" of interpretation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibiting such penalties. It thus paves the way to a modern interpretation of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] based on a new criterion: the "[[Living Constitution|evolving standards of decency of a maturing society]]" designed by the Supreme Court in [[Trop v. Dulles]], 356 U. S. 86 (1957) {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4332">In [[general relativity]], the '''Carminati–McLenaghan invariants''' or '''CM scalars''' are a set of 16 scalar [[curvature invariant]]s for the [[Riemann tensor]].  This set is usually supplemented with at least two additional invariants.

==Mathematical definition==

The CM invariants consist of 6 real scalars plus 5 complex scalars, making a total of 16 invariants.  They are defined in terms of the [[Weyl tensor]] &lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; and its right (or left) dual &lt;math&gt;{{}^\star C}_{ijkl}=(1/2)\epsilon_{klmn}C_{ij}{}^{mn}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Ricci tensor]] &lt;math&gt;R_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, and the ''trace-free Ricci tensor''
:&lt;math&gt; S_{ab} = R_{ab} - \frac{1}{4} \, R \, g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;
In the following, it may be helpful to note that if we regard &lt;math&gt;{S^a}_b&lt;/math&gt; as a matrix, then &lt;math&gt;{S^a}_m \, {S^m}_b&lt;/math&gt; is the ''square'' of this matrix, so the ''trace'' of the square is &lt;math&gt;{S^a}_b \, {S^b}_a&lt;/math&gt;, and so forth.  

The real CM scalars are:
#&lt;math&gt;R = {R^m}_m&lt;/math&gt; (the trace of the [[Ricci tensor]])
#&lt;math&gt;R_1 = \frac{1}{4} \, {S^a}_b \, {S^b}_a&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;R_2 = -\frac{1}{8} \, {S^a}_b \, {S^b}_c \, {S^c}_a&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;R_3 = \frac{1}{16} \, {S^a}_b \, {S^b}_c \, {S^c}_d \, {S^d}_a&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;M_3 = \frac{1}{16} \, S^{bc} \, S_{ef} \left( C_{abcd} \, C^{aefd} + {{}^\star C}_{abcd} \, {{}^\star C}^{aefd} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;M_4 = -\frac{1}{32} \, S^{ag} \, S^{ef} \, {S^c}_d \, \left( {C_{ac}}^{db} \, C_{befg} + {{{}^\star C}_{ac}}^{db} \, {{}^\star C}_{befg} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
The complex CM scalars are:
#&lt;math&gt;W_1 = \frac{1}{8} \, \left( C_{abcd} + i \, {{}^\star C}_{abcd} \right) \, C^{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;W_2 = -\frac{1}{16} \, \left( {C_{ab}}^{cd} + i \, {{{}^\star C}_{ab}}^{cd} \right) \, {C_{cd}}^{ef} \, {C_{ef}}^{ab}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;M_1 = \frac{1}{8} \, S^{ab} \, S^{cd} \, \left( C_{acdb} + i \, {{}^\star C}_{acdb} \right)&lt;/math&gt; 
#&lt;math&gt;M_2 = \frac{1}{16} \, S^{bc} \, S_{ef} \, \left( C_{abcd} \, C^{aefd} -  {{}^\star C}_{abcd} \, {{}^\star C}^{aefd} \right) + \frac{1}{8} \, i \, S^{bc} \, S_{ef} \, {{}^\star C}_{abcd} \, C^{aefd}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;M_5 = \frac{1}{32} \, S^{cd} \, S^{ef} \, \left( C^{aghb} +  i \, {{}^\star C}^{aghb} \right) \, \left( C_{acdb} \, C_{gefh} + {{}^\star C}_{acdb} \, {{}^\star C}_{gefh} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The CM scalars have the following [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]]s:
#&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is linear,
#&lt;math&gt;R_1, \, W_1&lt;/math&gt; are quadratic,
#&lt;math&gt;R_2, \, W_2, \, M_1&lt;/math&gt; are cubic,
#&lt;math&gt;R_3, \, M_2, \, M_3&lt;/math&gt; are quartic,
#&lt;math&gt;M_4, \, M_5&lt;/math&gt; are quintic.
They can all be expressed directly in terms of the [[Ricci spinors]] and [[Weyl spinors]], using [[Newman–Penrose formalism]]; see the link below.

==Complete sets of invariants==
In the case of [[spherically symmetric spacetime]]s or planar symmetric spacetimes, it is known that 
:&lt;math&gt;R, \, R_1, \, R_2, \, R_3, \, \Re (W_1), \, \Re (M_1), \, \Re (M_2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{32} \, S^{cd} \, S^{ef} \, C^{aghb} \, C_{acdb} \, C_{gefh}&lt;/math&gt;
comprise a [[complete set]] of invariants for the Riemann tensor.  In the case of [[vacuum solution (general relativity)|vacuum solution]]s, [[electrovacuum solution]]s and perfect [[fluid solution]]s, the CM scalars comprise a complete set.  Additional invariants may be required for more general spacetimes; determining the exact number (and possible [[Syzygy (mathematics)|syzygies]] among the various invariants) is an open problem.

'''Chang Chun-ha''' (장준하, 張俊河, August 27, 1918 in [[Uiju County]] – August 17, 1975 in [[Uijeongbu]], [[Gyeonggi Province]]) was a [[Korea]]n independence and democracy activist who later became a journalist in South Korea.

==Military career==
When [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea was under Japanese rule]], he participated in education activities and voluntarily joined the Japanese army called Sugada but he escaped the army in 1944 when he was in [[Suzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]. His joining of Sugada army was only nominally voluntarily as it was forced by the Japanese army for Korean males to join the army.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} He then was trained at China Central Officer School and became a warrant officer in the Chinese Central Army. In 1945, he visited [[Korean Liberation Army]] located in Suzhou and joined the army from the February as a commissioned officer. While serving the Korean liberation army, he participated activities with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS; the predecessor of the [[CIA]]). In November 1945, he came back to Korea via the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=임정귀국|url=http://www.ihs21.org/bbs/zboard.php?id=photo200&amp;page=6&amp;sn1=&amp;divpage=1&amp;sn=off&amp;ss=on&amp;sc=on&amp;select_arrange=headnum&amp;desc=asc&amp;no=99|publisher=1999 Institute of Historical Studies|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihs21.org/bbs/zboard.php?id=photo200&amp;page=6&amp;sn1=&amp;divpage=1&amp;sn=off&amp;ss=on&amp;sc=on&amp;select_arrange=headnum&amp;desc=asc&amp;no=99]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
After returning to Korea, Chang worked as a secretary of [[Kim Gu]] and participated in [[Lee Beom-seok (Prime Minister)|Lee Beom-seok]]'s Chosun Ethnic Youth League. After the establishment of Republic of Korea, during the [[First Republic of South Korea]], he worked for the government as a secretary. In 1950, he was in charge of citizen spirit reformation in the Ministry of Education and Culture (문교부). In 1952, he was the directing manager of national ideology research institution. He also worked in two more positions in the Ministry of Education and Culture and founded a periodical called ''Sasangge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=사상계|url=http://100.daum.net/encyclopedia/view.do?docid=b11s0350a|publisher=브리태니커|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established the [[Dong-in Literary Award]] in 1956. ''Sasangge'' acrimoniously denounced the [[자유당]] administration and became the starting fire of the 4.19 revolution. After the 4.19 revolution took place, he took positions in the Ministry of Munkyo during the second republic.

After the [[May 16 coup]], he opposed the South Korea–Japan conference and the sending of troops to [[Vietnam War]]. During the [[South Korean presidential election, 1967]], he made an issue out of the career of [[Yun Bo-seon]] on [[Park Chung-hee]]'s pro-Japanese and [[Workers' Party of South Korea]] activities. He was then sent into prison for insulting the head of the state. After he came out of prison, he worked with [[Yun Bo-seon]] and [[New Democratic Party (South Korea)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nahm|first=Andrew C.|title=Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Korea|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=148|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=hyukt3Lp7i8C&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=shinmindang&amp;hl=ko&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O31GU7b_LdC_kgWR1ICAAQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=shinmindang&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the [[Korean National Party]].

From 1975, when he was preparing to fight against the [[Park Chung-hee]] administration, he died mysteriously in [[Pocheon]], [[Gyeonggi-do]]. The South Korean government announced that Chang's death had been caused by loss of footing while climbing down a mountain. However, after Chang's death, continuous doubts were raised whether it was a homicide by Park's government. To such doubts, the Park administration declared the state of national emergency and arrested anyone who mentioned the death of Chang Chun-ha. The death of Chang Chun-ha has been re-investigated, but there have not been any clear conclusions yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Park|first=Kyung-Man|title=Chang Chun-ha’s family hopes to know truth of his death after 37 years|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/547355.html|accessdate=10 April 2014|newspaper=the Hankyoreh|date=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Chang was awarded the 1962 [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for Journalism, Literature, and the Creative Communication Arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmaf.org.ph/newrmaf/main/awardees/filter/all/c/all/all/1 Awardees] [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12755">The '''chronology protection conjecture''' is a conjecture first proposed by [[Stephen Hawking]] which hypothesizes that the [[laws of physics]] are such as to prevent [[time travel]] on all but submicroscopic scales.  The permissibility of time travel is represented mathematically by the existence of [[closed timelike curve]]s in some [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solutions to General Relativity]]. The chronology protection conjecture should be distinguished from [[cosmic censorship hypothesis|chronological censorship]] under which every closed timelike curve passes through an [[event horizon]], which might prevent an observer from detecting the '''causal violation'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Are Causality Violations Undesirable? |date=2008-10-29 |doi=10.1007/s10701-008-9254-9 | volume=38 |issue=11 |journal=Foundations of Physics |pages=1065–1069|arxiv = gr-qc/0609054 |bibcode = 2008FoPh...38.1065M |last1=Monroe |first1=Hunter }}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as '''chronology violation''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Visser, Matt| title= Traversable wormholes: the Roman ring | arxiv=gr-qc/9702043 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.55.5212 | volume=55 | issue= 8 | journal=Physical Review D | pages=5212–5214| bibcode=1997PhRvD..55.5212V| year= 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
In a 1992 paper, Hawking uses the metaphorical device of a "''Chronology Protection Agency''" as a [[personification]] of the aspects of physics that make time travel impossible at macroscopic scales, thus apparently preventing [[time paradox]]es. He says:

{{quote|It seems that there is a Chronology Protection Agency which prevents the appearance of closed timelike curves and so makes the universe safe for historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawking | first1 = S. W. | year = 1992 | title = Chronology protection conjecture | url = | journal = Phys. Rev. D | volume = 46 | issue = 2| page = 603 | doi=10.1103/physrevd.46.603| bibcode = 1992PhRvD..46..603H}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The idea of the Chronology Protection Agency appears to be drawn playfully from the Time Patrol or Time Police concept, which has been used in many works of [[science fiction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/time_police |title=Time Police : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia |publisher=Sf-encyclopedia.com |date=December 21, 2011 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Poul Anderson]]'s series of [[Time Patrol]] stories or [[Isaac Asimov]]'s novel ''[[The End of Eternity]]'', or in the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]''.  [[Phil D'Amato#"The Chronology Protection Case"|"The Chronology Protection Case"]] by [[Paul Levinson]], posits a universe that goes so far as to murder any scientists who are close to inventing any means of time travel.

==General relativity and quantum corrections==
Many attempts to generate scenarios for closed timelike curves have been suggested, and the theory of [[general relativity]] does allow them in certain circumstances. Some theoretical solutions in general relativity that contain closed timelike curves would require an infinite universe with certain features that our universe does not appear to have, such as the universal rotation of the [[Gödel metric]] or the rotating cylinder of infinite length known as a [[Tipler cylinder]]. However, some solutions allow for the creation of closed timelike curves in a bounded region of spacetime, with the [[Cauchy horizon]] being the boundary between the region of [[spacetime]] where closed timelike curves can exist and the rest of spacetime where they cannot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gott | first=J. Richard | authorlink=J. Richard Gott | title=Time Travel in Einstein's Universe: The Physical Possibilities of Travel Through Time | publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] | year= 2001 | page=117 | isbn=978-0-395-95563-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first such bounded time travel solutions found was constructed from a [[Wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormhole]], based on the idea of taking one of the two "mouths" of the wormhole on a round-trip journey at relativistic speed to create a time difference between it and the other mouth (see the discussion at [[Wormhole#Time travel]]).

General relativity does not include [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] effects on its own, and a full integration of general relativity and quantum mechanics would require a theory of [[quantum gravity]], but there is an approximate method for modeling quantum fields in the curved spacetime of general relativity, known as [[semiclassical gravity]]. Initial attempts to apply semiclassical gravity to the traversable wormhole time machine indicated that at exactly the moment that wormhole would first allow for closed timelike curves, quantum [[Virtual particle#Virtual particles in vacuums|vacuum fluctuations]] build up and drive the [[energy density]] to infinity in the region of the wormholes. This occurs when the two wormhole mouths, call them A and B, have been moved in such a way that it becomes possible for a particle or wave moving at the speed of light to enter mouth B at some time T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and exit through mouth A at an earlier time T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then travel back towards mouth B through ordinary space, and arrive at mouth B at the same time T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that it entered B on the previous loop; in this way the same particle or wave can make a potentially infinite number of loops through the same regions of spacetime, piling up on itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Thorne | first=Kip S. | authorlink=Kip Thorne | title=Black Holes and Time Warps | publisher=[[W. W. Norton]] | year= 1994 | pages=505–506 | isbn=978-0-393-31276-8| title-link=Black Holes and Time Warps }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculations showed that this effect would not occur for an ordinary beam of radiation, because it would be "defocused" by the wormhole so that most of a beam emerging from mouth A would spread out and miss mouth B.&lt;ref&gt;Thorne 1994, p. 507&lt;/ref&gt; But when the calculation was done for [[Quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuations]], it was found that they would spontaneously refocus on the trip between the mouths, indicating that the pileup effect might become large enough to destroy the wormhole in this case.&lt;ref&gt;Thorne 1994, p. 517&lt;/ref&gt;

Uncertainty about this conclusion remained, because the semiclassical calculations indicated that the pileup would only drive the energy density to infinity for an infinitesimal moment of time, after which the energy density would die down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Everett | first=Allen |author2=Roman, Thomas | title=Time Travel and Warp Drives | publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] | year= 2012 | page=190 | isbn=978-0-226-22498-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; But semiclassical gravity is considered unreliable for large energy densities or short time periods that reach the [[Planck scale]]; at these scales, a complete theory of quantum gravity is needed for accurate predictions. So, it remains uncertain whether quantum-gravitational effects might prevent the energy density from growing large enough to destroy the wormhole.&lt;ref&gt;Everett and Roman 2012, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Hawking conjectured that not only would the pileup of vacuum fluctuations still succeed in destroying the wormhole in quantum gravity, but also that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] would ultimately prevent ''any'' type of time machine from forming; this is the chronology protection conjecture.&lt;ref name="EvRom191"&gt;Everett and Roman 2012, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent works in semiclassical gravity provided examples of spacetimes with closed timelike curves where the energy density due to vacuum fluctuations does not approach infinity in the region of spacetime outside the Cauchy horizon.&lt;ref name="EvRom191" /&gt; However, in 1997 a general proof was found demonstrating that according to semiclassical gravity, the energy of the quantum field (more precisely, the expectation value of the quantum stress-energy tensor) must ''always'' be either infinite or undefined on the horizon itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Bernard | last=Kay | last2=Radzikowski | first2=Marek | last3=Wald | first3=Robert | author3-link=Robert Wald | title=Quantum Field Theory on Spacetimes with a Compactly Generated Cauchy Horizon | journal=Communications in Mathematical Physics | volume=183 | year=1997 | issue=3 | pages=533–556 | doi=10.1007/s002200050042 | arxiv=gr-qc/9603012v2 |bibcode=1997CMaPh.183..533K | citeseerx=10.1.1.339.6036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both cases indicate that semiclassical methods become unreliable at the horizon and quantum gravity effects would be important there, consistent with the possibility that such effects would always intervene to prevent time machines from forming.&lt;ref name="EvRom191" /&gt;

A definite theoretical decision on the status of the chronology protection conjecture would require a full theory of [[quantum gravity]]&lt;ref&gt;Thorne 1994, p. 521&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to semiclassical methods (there are also some arguments from [[string theory]] that seem to support chronology protection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Semeniuk | first=Ivan | title=No going back | newspaper=[[New Scientist]] | date=20 September 2003 | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17924134.800-no-going-back.html | accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=C.A.R. | last=Herdeiro | title=Special properties of five-dimensional BPS rotating black holes | journal=Nuclear Physics B | volume=582 | year=2000 | issue=1–3 | pages=363–392 | doi=10.1016/S0550-3213(00)00335-7 | arxiv=hep-th/0003063 |bibcode=2000NuPhB.582..363H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Marco | last=Caldarelli | last2=Klemm | first2=Dietmar | last3=Silva | first3=Pedro | title=Chronology protection in anti-de Sitter | journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity | volume=22 | year=2005 | issue=17 | pages=3461–3466 | doi=10.1088/0264-9381/22/17/007 | arxiv=hep-th/0411203 |bibcode=2005CQGra..22.3461C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Marco | last=Caldarelli | last2=Klemm | first2=Dietmar | last3=Sabra | first3=Wafic | title=Causality violation and naked time machines in AdS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; | journal=Journal of High Energy Physics | year=2001 | issue=5 | doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2001/05/014 | arxiv=hep-th/0103133 |bibcode=2001JHEP...05..014C | volume=2001 | pages=014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raeymaekers |first=Joris |last2=Van den Bleeken |first2=Dieter |last3=Vercnocke |first3=Bert |arxiv=0911.3893 |title=Relating chronology protection and unitarity through holography |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/JHEP04(2010)021 |volume=2010 |issue=4 |pages=21 |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|bibcode=2010JHEP...04..021R }}&lt;/ref&gt; but string theory is not yet a complete theory of quantum gravity). Experimental observation of closed timelike curves would of course demonstrate this conjecture to be [[falsifiability|false]], but short of that, if physicists had a theory of quantum gravity whose predictions had been well-confirmed in other areas, this would give them a significant degree of confidence in the theory's predictions about the possibility or impossibility of time travel.

Other proposals that allow for backwards time travel but prevent [[Physical paradox#Causality paradoxes|time paradoxes]], such as the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]], which would ensure the timeline stays consistent, or the idea that a time traveler is taken to a [[Many-worlds interpretation|parallel universe]] while his original timeline remains intact, do not qualify as "chronology protection".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15430">In [[economics]], a '''common-pool resource''' ('''CPR''') is a type of [[good (economics)|good]] consisting of a [[natural resource|natural]] or [[human]]-made [[Resource (economics)|resource]] system (e.g. an irrigation system or fishing grounds), whose size or characteristics makes it costly, but not impossible, to exclude potential beneficiaries from obtaining benefits from its use. Unlike pure [[public good]]s, common pool resources face problems of [[:wikt:congestion|congestion]] or overuse, because they are subtractable.  A common-pool resource typically consists of a core resource (e.g. water or fish), which defines the ''stock variable'', while providing a limited quantity of extractable fringe units, which defines the ''flow variable''. While the core resource is to be protected or nurtured in order to allow for its continuous exploitation, the fringe units can be harvested or consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ostrom |first=Elinor |title=Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action |year=1990 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=0 521 40599 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common property systems==
A common property rights regime system (not to be confused with a common-pool resource) is a particular [[society|social]] arrangement [[regulation|regulating]] the preservation, maintenance, and [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of a common-pool resource. The use of the term "common property resource" to designate a type of good has been criticized, because common-pool resources are not necessarily governed by common property protocols. Examples of common-pool resources include [[irrigation]] systems, [[fishing]] grounds, [[pasture]]s, [[forest]]s, [[water]] or the [[atmosphere]]. A pasture, for instance, allows for a certain amount of [[grazing]] to occur each year without the core resource being harmed. In the case of excessive grazing, however, the pasture may become more prone to erosion and eventually yield less benefit to its users. Because the core resources are vulnerable, common-pool resources are generally subject to problems of [[:wikt:congestion|congestion]], overuse, [[pollution]], and potential destruction unless harvesting or use limits are devised and enforced.&lt;ref name="EED"&gt;{{cite web |author=Environmental Economics Dictionary |url=http://economics.socialsciencedictionary.com/Environmental-Economics-Dictionary/Open_Access_Resource |title=Open Access Resource definition &amp;#124; Environmental Economics Dictionary |publisher=Economics.socialsciencedictionary.com |date=2008-04-30 |accessdate=2014-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130703113927/http://economics.socialsciencedictionary.com/Environmental-Economics-Dictionary/Open_Access_Resource |archivedate=2013-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
The use of many common-pool resources, if managed carefully, can be extended because the resource system forms a [[negative feedback]] loop, where the stock variable continually regenerates the fringe variable as long as the stock variable is not compromised, providing an optimum amount of consumption. However, consumption exceeding the fringe value reduces the stock variable, which in turn decreases the flow variable. If the stock variable is allowed to regenerate then the fringe and flow variables may also recover to initial levels, but in many cases the loss is irreparable.&lt;ref name="EED" /&gt;

==Ownership==
Common-pool resources may be owned by national, regional or local governments as [[public good]]s, by communal groups as [[Common ownership|common property resources]], or by private individuals or corporations as [[private good]]s. When they are owned by no one, they are used as [[Open access (infrastructure)|open access resources]]. Having observed a number of common pool resources throughout the world, [[Elinor Ostrom]] noticed that a number of them are governed by [[Common ownership|common property protocols]] — arrangements different from private property or state administration — based on [[Worker self-management|self-management]] by a local community. Her observations contradict claims that common-pool resources must be privatized or else face destruction in the long run due to [[collective action]] problems leading to the overuse of the core resource&lt;ref name="EED" /&gt; (''see  also [[Tragedy of the commons]]'').

==Common property protocols==
Common property systems of management arise when users acting independently threaten the total net benefit from common-pool resource. In order to maintain the resources,  protocols coordinate strategies to maintain the resource as a common property instead of dividing it up into parcels of [[private property]]. Common property systems typically protect the core resource and allocate the fringe resources through complex [[community]] norms of [[consensus decision-making]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Global Encyclopaedia of Welfare Economics |publisher=Global Vision Publishing House |author=Mandal, B.N. |year=2009 |isbn=978-8182202597}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common resource management has to face the difficult task of devising rules that limit the amount, timing, and [[technology]] used to withdraw various resource units from the resource system. Setting the limits too high would lead to overuse and eventually to the destruction of the core resource while setting the limits too low would unnecessarily reduce the benefits obtained by the users.

In common property systems, access to the resource is not free and common-pool resources are not [[public good]]s. While there is relatively free but monitored access to the resource system for community members, there are mechanisms in place which allow the community to exclude outsiders from using its resource. Thus, in a common property state, a common-pool resource appears as a [[private good]] to an outsider and as a [[common good]] to an insider of the community. The resource units withdrawn from the system are typically owned individually by the appropriators.  A common property good is rivaled in consumption.

Analysing the design of long-enduring CPR institutions, [[Elinor Ostrom]] identified eight design principles which are prerequisites for a stable CPR arrangement:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Governing the commons: the evolution of institutions for collective action. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |author=Ostrom, Elinor |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Clearly defined boundaries
# Congruence between appropriation and provision rules and local conditions
# Collective-choice arrangements allowing for the participation of most of the appropriators in the decision making process
# Effective monitoring by monitors who are part of or accountable to the appropriators
# Graduated sanctions for appropriators who do not respect community rules
# Conflict-resolution mechanisms which are cheap and easy to access
# Minimal recognition of rights to organize (e.g., by the government)
# In case of larger CPRs: Organisation in the form of multiple layers of nested enterprises, with small, local CPRs at their bases.

Common property systems typically function at a local level to prevent the [[overexploitation]] of a resource system from which fringe units can be extracted. In some cases, government regulations combined with [[Emissions trading|tradable environmental allowances]] (TEAs) are used successfully to prevent excessive pollution, whereas in other cases — especially in the absence of a unique government being able to set limits and monitor economic activities — excessive use or pollution continue.

===Adaptive governance===
The management of common-pool resources is highly dependent upon the type of resource involved. An effective strategy at one location, or of one particular resource, may not be necessarily appropriate for another.  In ''The Challenge of Common-Pool Resources'', Ostrom makes the case for adaptive governance as a method for the management of common-pool resources. Adaptive governance is suited to dealing with problems that are complex, uncertain and fragmented,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.unu.edu/sub_page.aspx?catID=155&amp;ddlID=299 |title=UNU-IAS. (2011). "Adaptive Governance". United Nations University |publisher=Ias.unu.edu |date=2006-08-18 |accessdate=2014-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802015634/http://www.ias.unu.edu/sub_page.aspx?catID=155&amp;ddlID=299 |archivedate=2012-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the management of common-pool resources. Ostrom outlines five basic protocol requirements for achieving adaptive governance.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrom, Elinor. (2010). "The Challenge of common-pool resources". In: Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable
Development, 50:4, 8-21. [https://dx.doi.org/10.3200/ENVT.50.4.8-21]&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
* Achieving accurate and relevant information, by focusing on the creation and use of timely scientific knowledge on the part of both the managers and the users of the resource
* Dealing with conflict, acknowledging the fact that conflicts will occur, and having systems in place to discover and resolve them as quickly as possible
* Enhancing rule compliance, through creating responsibility for the users of a resource to monitor usage
* Providing infrastructure, that is flexible over time, both to aid internal operations and create links to other resources
* Encouraging adaption and change to address errors and cope with new developments

==Open access resources==
{{Hatnote|This section is about non-excludable resources in economics. It is not to be confused with [[Open access]] publishing of academic works.}}

In economics, open access resources are, for the most part, rivalrous, non-excludable goods. This makes them similar to common goods during times of prosperity. Unlike many common goods, open access goods require little oversight or may be difficult to restrict access.&lt;ref name="EED" /&gt; However, as these resources are first come, first served, they may be affected by the phenomenon of the [[tragedy of the commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Tietenberg |first=T. |authorlink=Thomas H. Tietenberg |chapter-url=http://editors.eol.org/eoearth/wiki/Open_access_resources |article=Open access resources |title=Encyclopedia of Earth |date=20 September 2006 |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two possibilities may follow: a common property or an open access system.

An open access system is set up to continue the ideals of an open access resource in which everything is up for grabs, e.g., land. This occurred during the expansion of the U.S. west where thousands of acres were given away to the first one to claim and work the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Reggio |first=Michael H. |date=2009 |chapter-url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=CH031 |article=Cheyenne-Arapaho Opening |title=Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |editor-first=Dianna |editor-last=Everett |location=Oklahoma City, OK |publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society |isbn=9780941498753 |access-date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a different setting, such as fishing, there will be drastically different consequences. Since fish are an open access resource, it is relatively simple to fish and profit. If fishing becomes profitable, there will be more fishers and fewer fish. Fewer fish lead to higher prices which will lead again to more fishers, as well as lower reproduction of fish. This is a negative [[externality]] and an example of problems that arise with open access goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www1.udel.edu/johnmack/apec324/324lec05.html |last=Mackenzie |first=John |date=2014 |title=Market Failures: Open-Access Resources, Public Goods, Etc. |format=lecture notes |access-date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dany Bébel-Gisler''' (7 April 1935 – 28 September 2003) was an Afro-Guadeloupean writer and [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguist]] who specialized in [[Antillean Creole]] and [[ethnology]]. She was one of the first linguists to defend the preservation and teaching of [[Creole language]]s and study how the interplay of the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Caribbean reflected the social hierarchy, as well as the assimilation or lack thereof of both the colonizers and colonized. She was instrumental in the development of [[UNESCO]]'s [[The Slave Route Project]], tracing the intersection of African, Caribbean and European cultures and published several novels and children's books on Guadeloupean culture.

Dany Bébel was born on 7 April 1935 in [[Pointe-à-Pitre]] on the island of [[Guadeloupe]] in the [[French Antilles]]. Her father's family owned a [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantation]] in Guadeloupe and her mother was a [[mulatto]] woman who was an agricultural worker on the plantation.{{sfn|Santiago|2016}} Growing up on her grandfather’s sugarcane plantation, she was encouraged to pursue her educational dreams in France.{{sfn|Mesh|1997|p=30}} During her teens, she moved to France and attended a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] in [[Toulouse]].{{sfn|Santiago|2016}} She then went on to study at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris. When she graduated, Bébel became the first person in her mother's family to have earned her [[baccalauréat]].{{sfn|Mesh|1997|p=30}} Receiving the Prix Spécial de Français, she went on to study at the [[Grandes écoles]], under the tutelage of [[Michel Leiris]], focusing on ethnology, linguistics and sociology.{{sfn|Santiago|2016}}{{sfn|Mesh|1997|p=30}}

==Career==
Bébel-Gisler began working in France in the 1960s,{{sfn|Santiago|2016}}{{sfn|Mesh|1997|p=30}} while she was completing her university studies. She taught in [[Nanterre]] and [[Aubervilliers]], focusing on educating immigrants and working-class students. She led an adult literacy program in Paris, which targeted African and Algerian immigrants.  In 1976, she returned to Guadeloupe with the goal of launching an experimental teaching project for rural residents living in the area around [[Lamentin]]. Her target group was illiterate adults who were not French-speaking, so that she could create a spelling system for the local [[Creole language]]. At the time, there were few Creole texts that did not look at the language from an [[Etymology|etymological]] analysis standpoint. Publishing a booklet, ''Kèk Prinsip Pou Ékri Kréyól'' (Some Principles for Writing in Kreol), in 1975, she proposed designing a notational system for [[Antillean Creole|Guadeloupean Creole]] based upon the [[Haitian Creole|Haitian]] model which had been developed, but which could be researched, refined, and applied to create a written standard for educational purposes.{{sfn|Schnepel|2004|p=89}} In 1976, she published ''La Langue créole, force jugulée'' (The Creole language, forced suppression), which evaluated the system in French schools which placed immigrant children in remedial classes because they could not speak standard French. Removing them from regular classes, she believed, caused students to feel inferior and impacted their further education and later their ability to get jobs.{{sfn|Mesh|1997|pp=30–31}} Thus, language, rather than being a commonality between peoples became a means of maintaining social boundaries.{{sfn|Santiago|2016}}

In 1979, Bébel-Gisler founded the alternative-educational Centre d'Education Populaire Bwadoubout, to provide literacy for disadvantaged adults or children who wanted access to learning, but may have been obstructed because formal schools taught only in French. She directed the center and received funding from the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Center for Scientific Research]],{{sfn|Schnepel|2004|pp=89–90}} though in effect, her work at Bwadoubout undermined the governmental objectives of assimilation.{{sfn|Schnepel|2004|p=91}} Language became a vehicle for activism,{{sfn|Schnepel|2004|p=90}}{{sfn|Berrian|2000|p=40}} for Bébel-Gisler, who recognized that controlling access to knowledge insured that certain social classes or those with certain backgrounds controlled the power. By refusing to use French, Guadeloupeans were creating a distinction between themselves, their colonizer, and other Antillean colonies, as well as rejecting assimilation.{{sfn|Schnepel|2004|p=90}}

In addition to her educational efforts, Bébel-Gisler began publishing novels. In 1985, her biographical novel ''Lénora: l’histoire enfouie de la Guadeloupe'' (Leonora: the buried story of Guadeloupe) described the period between 1940 and 1943, when Governor {{ill|Constant Sorin|fr}} instituted policies to isolate Guadeloupe and [[Martinique]] from the potentiality of American or British occupation, leading to widespread suffering on the islands.{{sfn|Berrian|2000|p=111}} The book was released in English in 1994 and she published the children's book, ''Grand'mère, ça commence où la Route de l'esclave?'' (Grandmother, where does the Slave Route begin?) in 1998.{{sfn|''Île en île''|2015}} The book retraced the slave triangle and was a means of acknowledging the past and its impact on history.{{sfn|Santiago|2016}} In 2000, she published, ''À la recherche d’une odeur de grand’mère; D’en Guadeloupe une « enfant de la Dass » raconte…'' (In Search of Grandmother's Smell: Tales from a "child of the Dass" in Guadeloupe).{{sfn|''Île en île''|2015}} The book tells how the sugar plantation shaped both the landscape and the people who worked within it, replacing family ties with communal relationships and changing the nature of the relationships between men and women and parents and children. It explores the competing themes prevalent in Guadeloupean society where matrifocality and patriarchy  meet.{{sfn|Cases Rebelles|2017}}

In 1996, Bébel-Gisler became affiliated with [[UNESCO]]'s [[The Slave Route Project]], tracing the intersection of African, Caribbean and European cultures through the monuments of the [[slave trade]]. She was responsible for documenting the Caribbean portion of the route.{{sfn|MAXImini|2003}}{{sfn|''Île en île''|2015}} Bringing the project to Guadeloupe, she identified eighteen significant extant sites including plantations, forts, and jails.{{sfn|Young|2016}} 

==Death and legacy==
Bébel-Gisler died unexpectedly of a heart attack on 28 September 2003 at her home in Lamentin.{{sfn|MAXImini|2003}}{{sfn|''Île en île''|2015}} She is widely remembered for her activism in preserving Guadeloupean Creole.{{sfn|Santiago|2016}}{{sfn|Mesh|1997|pp=31–32}}

'''Delayed gratification''', or '''deferred gratification''', describes the process that the subject undergoes when the subject resists the temptation of an immediate reward in preference for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate   reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later.&lt;ref name = Carducci&gt;{{cite book |last=Carducci |first=Bernardo J. |year=2009 |chapter=Basic Processes of Mischel's Cognitive-Affective Perspective: Delay of Gratification and Conditions of Behavioral Consistency |pages=443–4 |title=The Psychology of Personality: Viewpoints, Research, and Applications |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-1-4051-3635-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay [[gratification]] to a host of other positive outcomes, including [[academic success]], physical health, [[psychological health]], and [[social competence]].

A person's ability to delay gratification relates to other similar skills such as [[patience]], impulse control, [[self-control]] and willpower, all of which are involved in self-regulation. Broadly, self-regulation encompasses a person's capacity to adapt the self as necessary to meet demands of the environment.&lt;ref name="MadduxTangney2010"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Celeste E. |last1=Doerr |first2=Roy F. |last2=Baumeister |year=2011 |chapter=Self-Regulatory Strength and Psychological Adjustment: Implications of the Limited Resource Model of Self-Regulation |chapterurl=https://books.googi did this on purpose because you can do this le.com/books?id=KPxfoCUUolsC&amp;pg=PA71 |pages=71–83 |editor1-first=James E. |editor1-last=Maddux |editor2-first=June Price |editor2-last=Tangney |title=Social Psychological Foundations of Clinical Psychology |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-60623-689-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaying gratification is the reverse of delay discounting, which is "the preference for smaller immediate rewards over larger but delayed rewards" and refers to the "fact that the subjective value of reward decreases with increasing delay to its receipt".&lt;ref name="Anokhin et al 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10519-010-9384-7 |title=Heritability of Delay Discounting in Adolescence: A Longitudinal Twin Study |year=2010 |last1=Anokhin |first1=Andrey P. |last2=Golosheykin |first2=Simon |last3=Grant |first3=Julia D. |last4=Heath |first4=Andrew C. |journal=Behavior Genetics |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=175–83 |pmid=20700643 |pmc=3036802}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorized that the ability to delay rewards is under the control of the [[cognitive-affective personality system]] (CAPS).&lt;ref name = Mischel10&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ethan |last1=Kross |first2=Walter |last2=Mischel |first3=Yichi |last3=Shoda |year=2011 |chapter=Enabling Self-Control |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPxfoCUUolsC&amp;pg=PA375 |pages=375–94 |editor1-first=James E. |editor1-last=Maddux |editor2-first=June Price |editor2-last=Tangney |title=Social Psychological Foundations of Clinical Psychology |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-60623-689-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of psychoanalytic theory, discussed the ego's role in balancing the immediate pleasure-driven desires of the id with the morality-driven choices of the superego.

==Background==

===The cognitive-affective processing system===
One well-supported theory of self-regulation, called the [[Cognitive-affective personality system]] (CAPS), suggests that delaying gratification results from an ability to use "cool" regulatory strategies (i.e., calm, controlled and cognitive strategies) over "hot regulatory strategies (i.e., emotional, impulsive, automatic reactions), when faced with provocation.&lt;ref name = Mischel10 /&gt; In "hot" processing, a person thinks intently about the object causing temptation, and especially about its most appealing elements, and is subsequently less able to resist the immediate reward. The use of cool strategies can translate to more control over behavior. Effective "cool" strategies involve distraction and restructuring the perception of the tempting stimulus to make it seem less appealing. For example, in one study of pre-adolescent boys with behavioral problems, the boys showed a reduction in verbal and physical aggression when they used "cool" strategies, such as looking away or distracting themselves.&lt;ref name= Romer /&gt; The most effective type of distraction seems to be imagining another desirable reward, which takes attention away from the immediate temptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Karasu |first=Sylvia R. |date=March 26, 2012 |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-gravity-weight/201203/lead-us-not-temptation-the-neuroscience-behind-the-marshmallow-test |title=Lead Us Not Into Temptation: The Neuroscience Behind the Marshmallow Test |work=Psychology Today |accessdate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Stanford marshmallow experiment===

The seminal research on delayed gratification – the now-famous "[[marshmallow experiment]]" – was conducted by [[Walter Mischel]] in the 1960s and 1970s at [[Stanford University]]. Mischel and his colleagues were interested in strategies that preschool children used to resist temptation. They presented four-year-olds with a marshmallow and told the children that they had two options: (1) ring a bell at any point to summon the experimenter and eat the marshmallow, or (2) wait until the experimenter returned (about 15 minutes later), and earn two marshmallows. The message was: "small reward now, bigger reward later." Some children broke down and ate the marshmallow, whereas others were able to delay gratification and earn the coveted two marshmallows. In follow-up experiments, Mischel found that children were able to wait longer if they used certain "cool" distraction techniques (covering their eyes, hiding under the desk, singing songs,&lt;ref name = Lehrer&gt;{{cite web |last=Lehrer |first=Jonah |date=May 18, 2009 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/18/090518fa_fact_lehrer |title=Don't!: The Secret of Self Control |work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; or imagining pretzels instead of the marshmallow in front of them), or if they changed the way they thought about the marshmallow (focusing on its similarity to a cotton ball, rather than on its gooey, delectable taste).&lt;ref name = Brooks&gt;{{cite news |last=Brooks |first=David |date=May 7, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/opinion/07brooks.html |title=Marshmallows and Public Policy |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Linehan&gt;{{cite book |first=Marsha |last=Linehan |title=Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder |year=1993 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-89862-034-4}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The children who waited longer, when re-evaluated as teenagers and adults, demonstrated a striking array of advantages over their peers. As teenagers, they had higher [[SAT]] scores, social competence, self-assuredness and self-worth, and were rated by their parents as more mature, better able to cope with stress, more likely to plan ahead, and more likely to use reason.&lt;ref name = Carducci/&gt; They were less likely to have [[conduct disorders]] or high levels of impulsivity, aggressiveness and hyperactivity.&lt;ref name = Mischel92 /&gt;&lt;ref name = Mischel11&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/scan/nsq081 |title='Willpower' over the life span: Decomposing self-regulation |year=2010 |last1=Mischel |first1=Walter |last2=Ayduk |first2=Ozlem |last3=Berman |first3=Marc G. |last4=Casey |first4=B.

Each of these positive outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward in favor of a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against [[rejection sensitivity]] (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds.&lt;ref name = Carducci /&gt;&lt;ref name = Linehan /&gt; These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.

Forty years after the first marshmallow test studies, neuroimaging data has shed light on the neural correlates of delayed gratification. A team led by B. J. Casey, of [[Cornell University]], recruited 59 of the original participants – who are now in their mid-40s – and gave them a delayed gratification task. Instead of resisting marshmallows, these adults were instructed to suppress responses to images of happy faces, but not to neutral or fearful faces. Those who had been high delayers as pre-schoolers were more successful at controlling their impulses in response to the emotional faces (i.e., not pressing the button in response to happy faces), suggesting that the high delayers continued to show better ability to dampen or resist impulses.&lt;ref name = Casey&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2011PNAS..10814998C |laysummary=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/thinking-cap-delaying-gratification/ |laysource=The New York Times |laydate=September 20, 2011 |title=Behavioral and neural correlates of delay of gratification 40 years later |author1=Casey |first1=B.

The researchers hypothesized that high delayers would be more likely to use "cool" regulation strategies to control their responses, which would manifest as activation of the right [[prefrontal cortex]], whereas low delayers would use "hot" strategies, which would activate the [[ventral striatum]], an area also linked to addiction. Indeed, results showed this differential brain activity.&lt;ref name = Casey/&gt; This mirrors other fMRI research of delayed gratification conducted by Noah Shamosh and Jeremy Gray, of [[Yale University]], demonstrating that individuals who chose larger delayed rewards over smaller immediate rewards (in hypothetical situations) showed greater brain activation in the anterior prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name = Phys.org&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02175.x |laysummary=http://phys.org/news140173735.html |laysource=Phys.org |laydate=Sep 9, 2008 |title=Individual Differences in Delay Discounting: Relation to Intelligence, Working Memory, and Anterior Prefrontal Cortex |year=2008 |last1=Shamosh |first1=Noah A. |last2=Deyoung |first2=Colin G. |last3=Green |first3=Adam E. |last4=Reis |first4=Deidre L. |last5=Johnson |first5=Matthew R. |last6=Conway |first6=Andrew R.A. |last7=Engle |first7=Randall W. |last8=Braver |first8=Todd S. |last9=Gray |first9=Jeremy R. |journal=Psychological Science |volume=19 |issue=9 |pages=904–11 |pmid=18947356 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors affecting one's ability==

===Neurocognitive factors===
The way that a person frames a situation heavily influences a decision's outcome.&lt;ref name="Khaneman 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.58.9.697 |title=A perspective on judgment and choice: Mapping bounded rationality |year=2003 |last1=Kahneman |first1=Daniel |journal=American Psychologist |volume=58 |issue=9 |pages=697–720 |pmid=14584987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on "hot" and "cool" strategies suggests that when children cognitively represent what they are waiting for as a real reward by focusing on the reward's arousing, "hot" qualities (taste, smell, sound,feel, etc.) their self-control and delay of gratification decreases, while directing attention to a symbol of the reward by focusing on its abstract, "cool" qualities (shape, color, number, etc.), can enhance self-control and increase the delay. Optimal self-control and the longest delay to gratification can be achieved by directing attention to a competing item, especially the arousing, "hot" qualities of a competing item.&lt;ref name = Lehrer/&gt; For example, delays are increased when thinking about the taste and smell of popcorn while waiting to eat candy. This illustrates an individual's ability to manipulate his/her cognitive representation of external stimuli for goal-directed purposes.&lt;ref name="Khaneman 2003"/&gt;

Delaying gratification is the same as controlling the impulse for immediate gratification, which requires cognitive control. The [[ventral striatum]], located in the [[midbrain]], is the part of the [[limbic system]] that is the reward center&lt;ref name = "pmid19164109"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/jn.90730.2008 |title=Short-Term Temporal Discounting of Reward Value in Human Ventral Striatum |year=2009 |last1=Gregorios-Pippas |first1=L. |last2=Tobler |first2=P.

The prefrontal cortex is also the part of the brain that determines the focus of a person's attention,&lt;ref name="Haines 2006"/&gt; which enables a better framing that facilitates delayed gratification.&lt;ref name= Lehrer/&gt;  During adolescence and early adulthood, the prefrontal cortex develops and matures to become more complicated and connected with the rest of the brain.&lt;ref name = Fair /&gt; Older children and adults find the deferment-of-gratification tasks easier than do young children for this reason.&lt;ref name =Fair/&gt; However, the relative ability to defer gratification remains stable throughout development.&lt;ref name = Lehrer/&gt; Children who can better control impulses grow up to be adults who also have better control.&lt;ref name = Lehrer /&gt; Practicing deferred gratification is quite beneficial to cognitive abilities throughout life.&lt;ref name = Lehrer /&gt;

===Behavioral factors===
Behaviorists focus on the acquisition and teaching of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. [[Applied behavior analysis|Behavior analysts]] capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It is important to note that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to the participant.&lt;ref name = Miller /&gt; Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.&lt;ref name = Miller /&gt;

Behavior theorists see delaying gratification as an adaptive skill.&lt;ref name = McComas&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2000.33-359 |title=Designing interventions that include delayed reinforcement: Implications of recent laboratory research |year=2000 |last1=Stromer |first1=R |last2=McComas |first2=J J |last3=Rehfeldt |first3=R A |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=359–71 |pmid=11051582 |pmc=1284263}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior, such as sharing and positive peer interactions.&lt;ref name = McComas /&gt; For example, students who learn to delay gratification are better able to complete their assigned activities.&lt;ref name = McComas /&gt; To put it simply, if someone undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after, the task's completion becomes more likely.

Behavioral researchers have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement.&lt;ref name = Begley /&gt; A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for a short amount of time and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued.&lt;ref name = Phys.org /&gt; Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0023-9690(80)90021-1 |title=An experimental analysis of impulsivity and impulse control in humans |year=1980 |last1=Solnick |first1=Jay V. |last2=Kannenberg |first2=Catherine H. |last3=Eckerman |first3=David A. |last4=Waller |first4=Marcus B. |journal=Learning and Motivation |volume=11 |pages=61–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individual thresholds for delay====
In a 2011 study, researchers tested to see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended on the amount of money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward.&lt;ref name = Begley /&gt; The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As [[prospect theory]] states, people are heavily loss-averse.&lt;ref name="Khaneman 2003"/&gt; People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.&lt;ref name="Khaneman 2003"/&gt;

====Duration of time delay====
The duration of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed gratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2001.34-101 |title=Temporal discounting: Basic research and the analysis of socially important behavior |year=2001 |last1=Critchfield |first1=T S |last2=Kollins |first2=S H |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=34 |pages=101–22 |pmid=11317983 |issue=1 |pmc=1284292}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 study demonstrated that if a reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, the bulk of the participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not worth the effort it takes to wait.

====Behavioral training====

=====Applications in classroom settings=====
In a Year 3 elementary classroom in South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan was put into place. The study gave limits on the numbers of questions the children could ask, and if they did not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The [[token economy]] for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2011.44-451 |title=Using Differential Reinforcement of Low Rates to Reduce Children's Requests for Teacher Attention |year=2011 |last1=Austin |first1=Jennifer L |last2=Bevan |first2=Deborah |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=451–61 |pmid=21941378 |pmc=3177329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Applications to ADHD=====
Compared to neurotypical children, those with [[ADHD]] generally demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more than by the frequency of reward and effort to obtain it. However, researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through the implementation of a simple self-control training procedure in which reinforcer immediacy competes with the frequency, quantity or saliency of the reward, and the delay is gradually increased.&lt;ref name = Binder&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2000.33-233 |title=A procedure to teach self-control to children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |year=2000 |last1=Binder |first1=L M |last2=Dixon |first2=M R |last3=Ghezzi |first3=P M |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=233–7 |pmid=10885530 |pmc=1284241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Neef 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2001.34-397 |title=Assessment of impulsivity and the development of self-control in students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |year=2001 |last1=Neef |first1=N A |last2=Bicard |first2=D F |last3=Endo |first3=S |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=397–408 |pmid=11800181 |pmc=1284336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Neef&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2005.146-02 |title=Behavioral Assessment of Impulsivity: A Comparison of Children with and Without Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder |year=2005 |last1=Neef |first1=Nancy A |last2=Marckel |first2=Julie |last3=Ferreri |first3=Summer J |last4=Bicard |first4=David F |last5=Endo |first5=Sayaka |last6=Aman |first6=Michael G |last7=Miller |first7=Kelly M |last8=Jung |first8=Sunhwa |last9=Nist |first9=Lindsay |last10=Armstrong |first10=N |editor1-last=Lerman |editor1-first=Dorothea |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=38 |pages=23–37 |pmid=15898472 |issue=1 |pmc=1224407|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with ADHD.&lt;ref name = "Neef 2001"/&gt; In another study, three children diagnosed with ADHD and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation of the quality of the reinforcers and by systematically increasing the delay with a changing-criterion design. Post-assessment of the children illustrated that self-control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement; such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in quantity over immediacy preference.&lt;ref name = Neef /&gt;

===Across the lifespan===
At birth, infants are unable to wait for their wants and needs to be met and exhibit a defining lack of impulse control. With age, developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong gratification.&lt;ref name = Mischel92 /&gt; Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control and delay of gratification over the lifespan, including deficiencies in development that are closely related to attention deficits and behavior problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Kumst, S., &amp; Scarf, D. |title=Your wish is my command! The influence of symbolic modelling on preschool children's delay of gratification |journal=PeerJ |year=2015 |volume=3|pages=e774|doi=10.7717/peerj.774|pmid=25737814 |pmc=4338768 |url=https://peerj.com/articles/774/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effects of age====
Children under five years old display the least effective strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay.&lt;ref name = Mischel92 /&gt; Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood.&lt;ref name = Casey /&gt; Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01732.x |jstor=40064397 |title=Predicting Cognitive Control from Preschool to Late Adolescence and Young Adulthood |year=2006 |last1=Eigsti |first1=Inge-Marie |last2=Zayas |first2=Vivian |last3=Mischel |first3=Walter |last4=Shoda |first4=Yuichi |last5=Ayduk |first5=Ozlem |last6=Dadlani |first6=Mamta B. |last7=Davidson |first7=Matthew C. |last8=Aber |first8=J.

====Effects of gender====
Throughout 33 studies on gender differences, a small significant effect (r = .06) has been found&lt;ref name = Tobin /&gt; indicating that a base-rate of 10% more females are able to delay rewards than males, which is the typical percentage of difference found between the sexes on measures such as personality or social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.98.1.198 |title=Self-discipline gives girls the edge: Gender in self-discipline, grades, and achievement test scores |year=2006 |last1=Duckworth |first1=Angela Lee |last2=Seligman |first2=Martin E.

Some researchers suggest this gender difference may correspond with a mother's tendency to sacrifice her wants and needs in order to meet those of her child more frequently than a father does.&lt;ref name = Silverman /&gt;

===Clinical factors===

====Contemporary clinical psychology perspectives====
Self-control has been called the "master virtue"&lt;ref name = Baumeister&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-6494.00086 |title=Virtue, Personality, and Social Relations: Self-Control as the Moral Muscle |year=1999 |last1=Baumeister |first1=Roy F. |last2=Juola Exline |first2=Julie |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=1165–94 |pmid=10637991}}&lt;/ref&gt; by clinical and social psychologists, suggesting that the ability to delay gratification plays a critical role in a person's overall psychological adjustment. People with better ability to delay gratification report higher wellbeing, self-esteem and openness to experience, as well as more productive ways of responding to anger and other provocations.&lt;ref name = Psychopedia /&gt; Early delay ability has been shown to protect against the development of a variety of emotional vulnerabilities later in life, such as aggression and features of borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name = Mischel11 /&gt; Meanwhile, many maladaptive coping skills that characterize mental illness entail a difficulty delaying gratification. The tendency to choose short-term rewards at the expense of longer-term benefits permeates many forms of psychopathology.

A growing body of research suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice.&lt;ref name="Baumeister" /&gt; In other words, self-control abilities are malleable,&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt; a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared.&lt;ref name="Barlow" /&gt; [[Exposure therapy]] is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes.&lt;ref name="Linehan" /&gt; For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.

===== Externalizing disorders =====
[[Externalizing disorders]] (i.e., acting-out disorders) show a clearer link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents,&lt;ref name="Mischel11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1996.tb00816.x |title=Delay of Gratification, Psychopathology, and Personality: Is Low Self-Control Specific to Externaiizing Problems? |year=1996 |last1=Krueger |first1=Robert F. |last2=Caspi |first2=Avshalom |last3=Moffitt |first3=Terrie E. |last4=White |first4=Jennifer |last5=Stouthamer-Loeber |first5=Magda |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=64 |pages=107–29 |pmid=8656312 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults.&lt;ref name="Mischel11" /&gt; In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis.&lt;ref name="Romer" /&gt; A 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for [[IQ]] (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02347.x |title=Delay discounting of reward in ADHD: Application in young children |year=2011 |last1=Wilson |first1=Vanessa B. |last2=Mitchell |first2=Suzanne H. |last3=Musser |first3=Erica D. |last4=Schmitt |first4=Colleen F. |last5=Nigg |first5=Joel T. |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=256–64 |pmid=21083561 |pmc=3059765}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification,&lt;ref name="Phys.org" /&gt; and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.

===== Internalizing disorders =====
Difficulty delaying gratification also plays a role in [[Internalizing disorder|internalizing disorders]] like [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="Psychopedia" /&gt; A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. [[Procrastination]], which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run.&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barlow |first1=David H. |last2=Durand |first2=V. Mark |year=2011 |title=Abnormal Psychology, An Integrative Approach |edition=6th |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth |isbn=978-1-111-34365-1}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Capacity to Delay Reward Differentiates Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder|year=2014|first=Anthony|last=Pinto|doi= 10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.09.007|journal=Biol Psychiatry|volume=75|pages=653–659|issue=8|pmc=3969772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear.&lt;ref name="Rehm"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(77)80150-0 |title=A self-control model of depression |year=1977 |last1=Rehm |first1=Lynn P. |journal=Behavior Therapy |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=787–804}}&lt;/ref&gt; A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate [[self-harm]] (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2010.04.009 |title=An experimental investigation of emotional willingness and physical pain tolerance in deliberate self-harm: The moderating role of interpersonal distress |year=2011 |last1=Gratz |first1=Kim L. |last2=Hepworth |first2=Claire |last3=Tull |first3=Matthew T. |last4=Paulson |first4=Autumn |last5=Clarke |first5=Sue |last6=Remington |first6=Bob |last7=Lejuez |first7=C.W. |journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry |volume=52 |pages=63–74 |pmid=21220067 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.

====Psychoanalytic drives and impulses====
[[Sigmund Freud]] viewed the struggle to delay gratification as a person's efforts to overcome the instinctive, libidinal drive of the id. According to classic psychoanalytic theory, a person's psyche is composed of the [[id, ego and superego]].&lt;ref name = Barlow /&gt; The id is driven by the [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]]: it wants physical pleasure, and it wants it now. The ego, operating under the [[reality principle]], serves to moderate the id's desire for instant gratification against the superego, which is guided by a person's internalized sense of morality.&lt;ref name = Barlow /&gt; According to [[psychoanalytic]] theory, a person with difficulty delaying gratification is plagued by intrapsychic conflict – the ego cannot adequately regulate the battle between the id and the superego – and experiences psychological distress, often in the form of anxiety or "neurosis".&lt;ref name = Barlow /&gt;

Other psychoanalytic researchers describe a more nuanced, and less universally positive, view of delayed gratification. [[David C. Funder]] and [[Jack Block]] theorized that a person's tendency to delay, or not delay, gratification is just one element of a broader construct called ego control, defined as a person's ability to modulate or control impulses.&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt; Ego control "ranges from ego undercontrol at one end to ego overcontrol at the other", according to Funder.&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt; These tendencies are thought to be relatively stable in each individual, such that someone who tends toward undercontrol will "grab whatever rewards are immediately available even at the cost of long-term gain" and someone who tends toward overcontrol will "delay or even forgo pleasures even when they can be had without cost".&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt; By this view, delay of gratification may be adaptive in certain settings, but inappropriate or even costly in other settings.

Funder and Block draw a distinction between the ego-control model, in which delayed gratification is seen as a general tendency to contain motivational impulses (whether or not it is adaptive in a specific instance), and the ego-resiliency model (supported by Mischel's research), in which delayed gratification is seen as a skill that arises only when it is adaptive.&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt; To tease apart these models, Funder and Block explored the association between ego control, ego resiliency, IQ and delayed gratification in adolescents. The adolescents had the choice between being paid $4 at each of six study sessions or delaying their payment until the last session, in which case they would also earn an addition $4 of "interest". The results supported both models of delayed gratification. The teens' tendency to delay gratification was indeed associated with IQ and with ego resiliency (e.g., higher delayers were rated as more responsible, consistent, likable, sympathetic, generous; less hostile, moody, self-indulgent, rebellious), but was also independently associated with ego control (e.g., higher delayers were rated as "tends toward over-control of needs and impulses" and "favors conservative values in a number of areas").&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt; The researchers noted that individual differences in ego control (i.e., overall impulsivity) may play a larger role in delayed gratification when the incentives are larger and more motivating.&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt;

Writing in 1998, Funder described delayed gratification as a "mixed bag". He concluded: "Participants who exhibited the most delay were not just 'better' at self-control, but in a sense they seemed unable to avoid it. [...] Delayers are in general smart and well-adjusted, but they also tend to be somewhat overcontrolled and unnecessarily inhibited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0903_3 |title=On the Pros and Cons of Delay of Gratification |year=1998 |last1=Funder |first1=David C. |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=211–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental and social factors===

====Who's in control====
Factors affecting one's ability to delay gratification depend on whether the delay contingency is self-imposed (delay can be terminated at the will of the person waiting) or externally imposed by another person, institution or circumstance. When the contingency is self-imposed, the physical presence of the reward seems to aid in delaying gratification. On the other hand, when the delay is externally imposed, children are not able to wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.&lt;ref name = Miller /&gt;

====Task engagement====
Engaging in work or an assigned task can generate an effective distraction from a reward and enable a person to wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.&lt;ref name=Mischel02 /&gt;

====Mother–child relationship====
The more positive emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies in order to delay gratification.&lt;ref name = Mischel00 /&gt; This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with social and interpersonal frustrations are similar to those utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown.&lt;ref name = Mischel00 /&gt; A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]], [[self-control]] and emotional competency.&lt;ref name = Rodriguez  /&gt;

====Reliability of gratification====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Marshmallow Graph.png|thumb|Mean wait time for children in unreliable vs. reliable environments]]  --&gt;Researchers have investigated whether the reliability of the reward affects one's ability to delay gratification.&lt;ref name = post /&gt; Reliability of the reward refers to how well the reward received matches what the person was expecting or promised in terms of quality and quantity. For example, researchers told children that they would receive better art supplies if they waited. After the children successfully waited for the reward, better supplies could not be "found" and so they had to use the crayons and stickers that were in poor shape. Comparing these children to ones who received their promised rewards reliably revealed different results on subsequent Marshmallow tests measuring delayed gratification. Children who had learned that the researcher's promise was unreliable quickly succumbed to eating the marshmallow, waiting only an average of three minutes. Conversely, children who had learned that the researcher was reliable were able to wait an average of 12 minutes, with many of them waiting the full 15 minutes for the researcher to return in order to double the reward to two marshmallows.&lt;ref name = post /&gt;

===Genetics and evolution===
Evolutionary theory can argue against the selection of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior.&lt;ref name = vanderBos&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.appet.2006.02.008 |title=Evolved to satisfy our immediate needs: Self-control and the rewarding properties of food |year=2006 |last1=van den Bos |first1=Ruud |last2=de Ridder |first2=Denise |journal=Appetite |volume=47 |pages=24–9 |pmid=16678304 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such cost is the basic [[opportunity cost]] associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time that could be used to find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage.&lt;ref name = vanderBos/&gt; There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk.&lt;ref name = Fawcett&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2011.08.015 |title=When is it adaptive to be patient? A general framework for evaluating delayed rewards |year=2012 |last1=Fawcett |first1=Tim W. |last2=McNamara |first2=John M. |last3=Houston |first3=Alasdair I. |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=128–36 |pmid=21920413 |url=https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/29424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk.&lt;ref name = Fawcett /&gt; These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.&lt;ref name = vanderBos /&gt;

It is likely that there is a strong genetic component to deferred gratification, though no direct link has been established. Since many complex genetic interactions are necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it is hard to isolate one gene to study this behavior.&lt;ref name = Lehrer /&gt; For this same reason, multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred gratification. Further research is necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed gratification.

==Animal studies==

Delayed gratification or deferred gratification is an animal behavior that can be linked to delay discounting, ecological factors, individual fitness, and neurobiological mechanisms. Research for this behavior has been conducted with animals such as [[capuchin monkey]]s, [[tamarin]]s, [[marmoset]]s, rats, and pigeons.

===Delay discounting===
When animals are faced with a choice to either wait for a reward, or receive a reward right away, the [[hyperbolic discounting|discounting]] of the reward is hyperbolic. As the length of time of waiting for a reward increases, the reward is discounted at a gradual rate. Empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting, rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of waiting time, only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging.&lt;ref name = Fawcett /&gt; Discounting can also be related to the risk sensitivity of animals. Rather than relating risk to delay, risk sensitivity acts as a function of delay discounting.&lt;ref name = Kalenscher&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.12.016 |title=Decision Making: Don't Risk a Delay |year=2007 |last1=Kalenscher |first1=Tobias |journal=Current Biology |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=R58–61 |pmid=17240330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Haden and Platt, macaque monkeys were given the choice of a medium reward that they knew they would receive, versus a more risky choice. The riskier choice would reward the monkey with a large reward fifty percent of the time, and a small reward the other fifty percent. The ultimate payoff was the same, but the monkeys preferred the riskier choice. They speculated that the monkeys did not see their action as risky, but rather as a large, delayed reward. They reasoned that the monkeys viewed the large reward as certain: if they did not get the large reward the first time around, they would eventually get it, but at a longer delay.
To test for this theory, they gave the same test while varying the time between the opportunities to choose a reward. They found that as the interval increased, the number of times that the monkeys chose the more risky reward decreased.&lt;ref name = Kalenscher /&gt; While this occurred in macaque monkeys, the varying interval time did not affect pigeons' choices in another study. This suggests that research looking into varying risk sensitivity of different species is needed.&lt;ref name = Kalenscher /&gt;  When provided a choice between a small, short delay reward, and a large, long delay reward, there is an impulsive preference for the former. Additionally, as the delay time for the small/short and large/long reward increases, there is a shift in preference toward the larger, delayed reward.&lt;ref name = Fawcett /&gt; This evidence only supports hyperbolic discounting, not exponential.

===Ecological factors===
Although predicting reward preference seems simple when using empirical models, there are a number of ecological factors that seem to affect the delayed gratification behavior of animals. In real world situations, "discounting makes sense because of the inherent uncertainty of future payoffs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.10.024 |title=Decision Making: The Virtue of Patience in Primates |year=2005 |last1=Long |first1=Arwen |last2=Platt |first2=Michael |journal=Current Biology |volume=15 |issue=21 |pages=R874–6 |pmid=16271858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study looked at how reward discounting is context specific.&lt;ref name = StevensRosati/&gt; By differing the time and space between small and large rewards, they were able to test how these factors affected the decision making in [[tamarins]] and [[marmosets]]. They showed that tamarins will travel longer distances for larger food rewards, but will not wait as long as marmosets. Conversely, marmosets will wait longer, but will not travel as far. They then concluded that this discounting behavior directly correlates to the normal feeding behavior of species. The tamarins feed over large distances, looking for insects. Capturing and eating insects requires a quick and impulsive decision and action. The marmosets, on the other hand, eat tree sap, which takes more time to secrete, but does not require that the marmosets to cover large distances.

The physiological similarities between humans and other animals, especially primates, have led to more comparative research between the two groups. Future research with animal models then can expand our own understanding of how people make decisions about instant versus delayed gratification in the real world.

'''Desmond Ravenstone''' ([[Boston, Massachusetts]]) is a writer, blogger, activist and educator on sexuality issues, who has addressed on [[BDSM]] and other [[alternative sexuality|alternative sexual identities]], and currently focuses on [[sex workers' rights]].  A former [[Unitarian Universalist]] [[lay leader]], he has frequently addressed the intersection of [[religion and sexuality|sexuality and spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teach.itg.emerson.edu/surviveandthrive/2009/12/polyamorous-community-seeks-mo.html |title=Polyamorous community seeks more support from Unitarian Universalist Association |publisher=Survive And Thrive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ravenstone first became involved in the BDSM community addressing the issue of "ravishment" or [[rape fantasy|rape fantasies]].  He wrote a number of articles and two books.&lt;ref&gt;Ravenstone, Desmond.  ''Ravishment: The Dark Side of Erotic Fantasy'' (2005)  {{ISBN|1-4116-5547-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravenstone, Desmond.  ''Taken: A Story of Ravishment'' (2005)  {{ISBN|1-4116-5559-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with both the psychology and practical enactment of ravishment role-play,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thephoenix.com/ADULT/blogs/eroticenquirer/archive/2008/03/19/holy-whip.aspx |title=Holy Whip: Interview with Desmond Ravenstone |publisher=Thephoenix.com |date= |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped to form the online Ravishment Network (RavNet) as a forum for education and advocacy.

Ravenstone has also led workshops on ravishment, [[sexual roleplaying|erotic role-playing]] and other subjects to a number of BDSM groups across the country.  He served as education coordinator for the New England Dungeon Society for two years, and authored an advice column for the online [[zine]] '‘The Dominant's View'’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedomsview.com/Vol6/I6/deardesmond.htm |title=Dear Desmond, Advice for the Kinky (archive) |publisher=Thedomsview.com |date= |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ravenstone was a member of [[Arlington Street Church]], an historic [[Unitarian Universalist]] congregation, where he served on the worship committee as well as Co-Moderator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ascboston.org/about/governance.html|title=Arlington Street Church - About Us: Governance }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other leadership roles; in the past, he has represented the congregation as a delegate to the Mass Bay District and the [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|UUA General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uupa.org/reports/GA2014-report |title=Report on General Assembly 2014 (PDF document) |publisher=Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502090905/http://uupa.org/reports/GA2014-report |archivedate=May 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote a blog for several years, '‘‘Ravenstone's Reflections'’’, offering his thoughts on sexuality, spirituality, politics and other related topics.  This gave him a prominent place to speak on behalf of kinksters, [[polyamory|polyamorists]] and other "alt-sexers" within the UU denomination.  Ravenstone started the organization [[Leather &amp; Grace]], for UUs identified with kink and BDSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leatherandgrace.wordpress.com |title=Leather &amp; Grace website |publisher=Leatherandgrace.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, he published a lengthy post on his blog, defending the view that kink should be regarded as a [[sexual orientation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com/2014/10/towards-more-inclusive-model-of-sexual.html |title=Towards a More Inclusive Model of Sexual Orientation |publisher=ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com |date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also carried as a guest blog on the website of the [[National Coalition for Sexual Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=https://ncsfreedom.org/?option=com_zoo&amp;task=item&amp;item_id=1007 |title=NCSF Guest Blog: Towards a More Inclusive Model of Sexual Orientation |publisher= National Coalition for Sexual Freedom |date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Ravenstone posted on his blog that he was leaving organized Unitarian Universalism, expressing frustration at how resistant the leadership of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]'s handled many issues, including those around sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com/2015/10/this-is-goodbye.html |title=This is Goodbye |publisher=ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com |date=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, he officially ended ''Ravenstone's Reflections'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com/2017/01/moving-on.html |title=Moving On ... |publisher=ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com |date=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced the start of a new blog devoted specifically to [[sex workers' rights]], ''The Harlot's Bulldog''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harlotsbulldog.wordpress.com/about/ |title=The Harlot's Bulldog |publisher=harlotsbulldog.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently administrates the website for Clients of Sex Workers Allied for Change (CoSWAC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexworkclients.org |title=CoSWAC: Clients of Sex Workers Allied for Change |publisher=sexworkclients.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ravenstone is politically unaffiliated, and describes himself as a "[[left libertarianism|libertarian progressive]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/people/Desmond-Ravenstone/100000472704628 |title=Desmond Ravenstone's Facebook page |publisher=Facebook.com |date=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "deep pragmatist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harlotsbulldog.wordpress.com/about/ |title=The Harlot's Bulldog |publisher=harlotsbulldog.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he ran a [[write-in]] campaign for president on a sexual freedom platform; his running-mate was [[Darklady|Theresa "Darklady" Reed]], a fellow writer and sexual-freedom activist from [[Oregon]].

[[File:SmileyFaceLaserGrafitti.jpg|thumb|Laser Graffiti in Vienna, August 31, 2007]]

'''Digital graffiti''' is the act of creating [[graffiti]] art using a [[computer vision]] system. Various groups and companies have pioneered digital graffiti since technology advances made it possible. Most notably is the [[Graffiti Research Lab]] based in the US with their [[L.A.S.E.R. Tag]] system.

Inspired by the New York laser graffiti movement, in 2008 the first commercially available digital graffiti wall was produced by Luma, named the [[YrWall]]. A specially adapted spray can emits [[Infrared|IR]] light instead of paint, which is then tracked by a [[computer vision]] system to recreate the "sprayed" image onto the wall using a projector.

Any system that allows art to be created on a large scale in a similar manner to more traditional graffiti falls under the heading digital graffiti.

Cisco Systems has released a mobile application called [Digital Graffiti] patented by [http://www.cisco.com   Cisco Systems, Inc.] to allow people to place messages of varying size, color, length of time visible, and viewing distance (say visible from 20 feet away) on a physical location, say a building, an office, a cubicle, or a specific location using their augmented reality mobile application.  This message alerts other visitors approaching the message coordinates by playing the Cisco chime and the mobile user's country origin filter when the app was installed.  It is like a virtual yellow stickie note, that can be delivered to an individual when they arrive at a message location.  Digital Graffiti leverages the Cisco MSE location server (which tracks users mobile devices and provides x, y coordinates of the mobile devices over WiFi).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geekgaps.com/?page_id=218  Digital Graffiti – the ‘new yellow stickie note’] GeekGaps.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14617">{{distinguish|text=[[gift (law)#intention|donative intent]] of a gift in law}}
In [[philanthropy]], '''donor intent''' is the purpose, sometimes publicly expressed, for which a philanthropist intends a [[grant (money)|charitable gift]] or [[bequest]]. Donor intent is most often expressed in gift restrictions, terms, or agreements between a donor and donee, but it may also be expressed separately in the words, actions, beliefs, and giving practices of a philanthropist. Donor intent is protected in American law regarding [[charitable trust]]s, and trustees' primary fiduciary obligation is to carry out a donor's wishes.&lt;ref name=Madoff&gt;{{cite book|last=Madoff|first=Ray D.|title=Immortality and the Law: The Rising Power of the American Dead|year=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=978-0-300-12184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fidelity to donor intent is sometimes distinguished from grant compliance, and "donor intent" refers to the actions of a grantmaking entity and grant compliance refers to the actions of a grant recipient, but the term donor intent is commonly used to refer to both the guiding principles of a grantmaking entity and the purposes of a specific gift.&lt;ref name=Cain&gt;{{cite book|last=Cain|first=Jeffrey J.|title=Protecting Donor Intent: How to Define and Safeguard Your Philanthropic Principles|year=2012|publisher=Philanthropy Roundtable|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-9851265-0-6|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/guidebook/protecting_donor_intent/foundation_management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many controversies, including litigation, over donor intent at [[private foundation (United States)|private foundations]], [[higher education|universities]], and arts organizations.&lt;ref name=Wooster&gt;{{cite book|last=Wooster|first=Martin Morse|title=The Great Philanthropists and the Problem of "Donor Intent"|year=2007|publisher=Capital Research Center|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1-892934-12-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CEHE&gt;{{cite web|title=Resources on Donor Intent|url=http://www.cehe.org/resources/|publisher=Center for Excellence in Higher Education|accessdate=6 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414113720/http://www.cehe.org/resources/|archivedate=14 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DI Library"&gt;{{cite web|title=Donor Intent Resource Library|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/donor_intent/donor_intent_resource_library|publisher=Philanthropy Roundtable|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor==
Donor intent has been defended as a moral obligation between giver and recipient. Defenders of donor intent argue that on a basic ethical level, trustees and gift recipients must do what they have agreed with the original donor to do, explicitly or implicitly: "When donor intent is violated, and particularly when it is egregiously violated, it undermines the bedrock trust on which all charitable giving rests."&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;

Donor intent is thus also defended as necessary to ensure future charitable giving.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frumkin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frumkin|first=Peter|title=Strategic Giving: The Art and Science of Philanthropy|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Ill.|isbn=978-0-226-26626-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future donors might not be inclined to leave money to charitable causes if they see that trustees, grant recipients, or policymakers do not respect the stated intent. [[Peter Frumkin]] has written that "as s a policy tool for encouraging future giving, protection of a donor's intent is needed to give future philanthropists the confidence they need to pass their wealth on to others to administer."[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gv9ejrvJf7AC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=%22the+confidence+they+need+to+pass+their+wealth+on+to+others+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k7M4KJDe55&amp;sig=4pK8KZcH4GnZQSUCnzoc4Pk7uLM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4n1CU5KqLoGy7Ab_zYD4Bw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20confidence%20they%20need%20to%20pass%20their%20wealth%20on%20to%20others%20%22&amp;f=false] [[Carl Schramm]], former president of the [[Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation]], has said on donor intent, "If we dont recognize it, we discourage wealthy people from creating foundations in the future."&lt;ref name=Schramm&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schramm|first=Carl|title=Examining the Role of Foundations in a Free Society|journal=Philanthropy|date=November–December 2007|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/examining_the_role_of_foundations_in_a_free_society|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survey data of Americans indicates that donor intent and grant compliance are valued by the public. When asked by [[Zogby International|Zogby]] if they would stop giving money to a charity that ignored a request to use a previous donation for a specific purpose, 53% said they would "definitely stop giving" and an additional 25.7% would "probably stop giving." When pollsters asked, "How important do you think showing respect for a donor's wishes is to the ethical governance of nonprofit charitable organizations?," 82.9% considered it "very important," 14.6% "somewhat important."&lt;ref name=Zogby&gt;{{cite web|title=Zogby America Adults 11/20/05 to 11/22/05|url=http://www.cehe.org/resources/ZogbyResults.pdf|publisher=Zogby International|accessdate=7 March 2012}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, respect for donor intent is defended as necessary to preserve pluralism in [[civil society]]: "Those who take the idea of donor intent seriously believe that only by protecting the idiosyncratic and at times outlandish ideas of donors will it be possible for philanthropy to innovate and pursue ideas that are either ahead of or behind their time," Frumkin has said.&lt;ref name=Frumkin /&gt;&lt;ref name=Meyerson-2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyerson|first=Adam|title=How Foundations Should and Should Not Be Held Accountable|journal=Philanthropy|date=Fall 2009|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/philanthropic_freedom/how_foundations_should_and_should_not_be_held_accountable|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against==
Many arguments against donor intent are made against honoring it in perpetuity.&lt;ref name=Madoff /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenwald&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenwald|first=Julius|title=Principles of Public Giving|journal=The Atlantic Monthly|date=May 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such arguments date back at least to the 18th century and French economist [[Jacques Turgot]]: "No work of man is made for immortality; and since foundations, always multiplied by vanity, would in the long run, if uninterfered with, absorb all funds and private properties, it would be absolutely necessary at last to destroy them."&lt;ref name=Turgot&gt;{{cite book|title=Giving Well, Doing Good|year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Ind.|isbn=978-0-253-21955-8|pages=333–338|author=Turgot, Jacques|editor=Amy Kass|chapter=Endowments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not arguing against donor intent ''per se'', [[Julius Rosenwald]] criticized philanthropic funds that are established in perpetuity, arguing that narrowly defined statements of donor intent can be superseded as situations change: " I have heard of a fund which provides a baked potato at each meal for each young woman at [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], and of another, dating from one of the great families, which pays for half a loaf of bread deposited each day at the door of each student in one of the colleges of [[Oxford University|Oxford]].... The list of these precisely focused gifts which have lost their usefulness could be extended into volumes."&lt;ref name=Rosenwald /&gt;

Another argument against donor intent relates to whether limitations may be placed on donors' purposes, either prudential or legal. In [[Augustus Octavius Bacon#Legacy|''Evans v. Abney'']], the Supreme Court held that [[Augustus Octavius Bacon]]'s clearly defined gift of a park to [[Macon, Georgia]], for whites only was illegal under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and so the gift reverted to Bacon’s heirs. In cases that donor intent can be modified, courts have latitude to do that under ''[[cy pres]]'' doctrine. Finally, some critics of donor intent argue that it cements [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref name=Ogden&gt;{{cite web|last=Ogden|first=Tim|title=The Thorny Problem of Donor Intent|url=http://www.philanthropyaction.com/nc/the_thorny_problem_of_donor_intent/|publisher=Philanthropy Action|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perpetuating donor intent ==
Donor intent is considered virtually impossible to be maintained in perpetuity because of changing situations, erosion of capital, and the distance of successor trustees from a donor. In some instances, however, donor intent has been lost only a short time after a donor's death. Waldemar Nielsen has argued that the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] swiftly lost the "democratic, hopeful, and constructive" spirit of [[Andrew Carnegie]]'s giving: "That within five years of his death his Corporation should have turned into a racist and reactionary machine to defend the privileges of the old [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] elite and block the advancement of immigrants and the underprivileged deformed his spirit and intent."&lt;ref name=Nielsen&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ethics of Giving and Receiving: Am I My Foolish Brother's Keeper?|year=2000|publisher=SMU Press|location=Dallas|pages=96–107|author=Nielsen, Waldemar|editor=William F. May and A. Lewis Soens Jr.|chapter=The Ethics of Philanthropy and Trusteeship; The Carnegie Foundation: A Case Study}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, the [[Daniels Fund]], established by [[Bill Daniels]], drifted away from what Daniels' trustees considered to be his principles, and the drift was arrested by board action.&lt;ref name=Sparks-Daniels&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sparks|first=Evan|title=Back to Bill|journal=Philanthropy|date=Fall 2011|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/donor_intent/back_to_bill|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gose&gt;{{cite news|last=Gose|first=Ben|title=Changes at Denver's Daniels Fund: Politics or Prudence?|newspaper=Chronicle of Philanthropy|date=February 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


Some donors have adopted strategies to prevent philanthropies that they create from drifting from donor intent.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;

=== Sunsetting versus perpetuity ===
Rosenwald cautioned donors against perpetuity: "I am opposed to gifts in perpetuity for any purpose."&lt;ref name=Rosenwald /&gt; Some donors have attempted to preserve their intent either by "giving while living"&lt;ref name=Feeney&gt;{{cite web|title=Turning Passion into Action: Giving While Living|url=http://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/sites/default/files/uploads/GWL_050510_1723%20%282%29.pdf|work=Atlantic Reports|publisher=Atlantic Philanthropies|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by establishing a date or timeframe in the future by which a foundation must disburse its assets, or "sunset." [[Chuck Feeney]] founded the [[Atlantic Philanthropies]], which is scheduled to spend down its assets by 2017. In 1975, inspired by the controversy over donor intent at the Ford Foundation, [[John M. Olin]] adopted plans for the [[John M. Olin Foundation]] to disburse its assets by 2005. Olin believed that capitalism was the basis of prosperity and sought to promote [[conservative]] political and legal thinking.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=John J.|title=A Gift of Freedom: How the John M. Olin Foundation Changed America|year=2006|publisher=Encounter Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=1-59403-117-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spend-down plan gave the Olin Foundation the spending profile of a foundation with three times as many assets, Jeffrey Cain has written: "The Olin Foundation made a deliberate decision to have a profound impact on its time, rather than a lighter one that spanned years into the future."&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;

=== Mission statements ===
Carnegie left the Carnegie Corporation's mission vague and open-ended by instructing his successors to "promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding" but also granting "full authority to change policies or causes hitherto aided, from time to time, when this, in their opinion, has become necessary or desirable. They shall best conform to my wishes by using their own judgment."&lt;ref name="Carnegie Mission"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission and Vision|url=http://carnegie.org/about-us/mission-and-vision/|publisher=Carnegie Corporation of New York|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In creating the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]], [[John D. MacArthur]] reportedly told his lawyer, "I'll make [the money]. But you people, after I'm dead, will have to learn how to spend it."&lt;ref name=Wooster /&gt;

Other donors are much narrower. [[James B. Duke]] specified percentages of the annual payout that would go to various categories of giving by the [[Duke Endowment]], including even a formula for reimbursing charity [[hospital]]s.&lt;ref name=Sparks-Duke&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sparks|first=Evan|title=Duke of Carolina|journal=Philanthropy|date=Winter 2011|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/donor_intent/duke_of_carolina|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, some donors leave detailed documents to supplement official [[mission statement]]s, including reflections on their principles, video statements, and records of their personal giving.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;

=== Trustees and staff ===
Often, donors select family members, personal business associates, lawyers, or nonprofit leaders to serve on their boards.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt; The Daniels Fund requires trustees to sign a statement affirming that they understand Bill Daniels' donor intent and will honor it in their decision-making on behalf of the foundation.&lt;ref name=Sparks-Daniels /&gt; The foundation that was created by [[Lloyd Noble]] recruits [[apprentice]] trustees to shadow the actual board; some are elected to the board in the future.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt; At meetings of the Duke Endowment's board, James B. Duke's original [[tust instrument|indenture of trust]] is read aloud to reinforce his intentions.&lt;ref name=Sparks-Duke /&gt; The [[John Templeton Foundation]] has a provision for periodic "donor intent audits" to ensure its officers uphold [[John Templeton]]'s purposes.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;

{{Sustainable energy}}

The '''Energy Hierarchy''' is a classification of [[energy]] options, prioritised to assist progress towards a more [[sustainable energy]] system. It is a similar approach to the [[waste hierarchy]] for minimising [[resource depletion]], and adopts a parallel sequence.

The highest priorities cover the prevention of unnecessary energy usage both through eliminating waste and improving [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. The sustainable production of energy resources is the next priority. Depletive and waste-producing energy generation options are the lowest priority.

For an energy system to be sustainable: the resources applied to producing the energy must be capable of lasting indefinitely; [[energy conversion]] should produce no harmful by-products, including net emissions, nor wastes which cannot be fully recycled; and it must be capable of meeting reasonable energy demands.

==Energy saving==
{{main article|Energy conservation}}
The top priority under the Energy Hierarchy is energy conservation or the prevention of unnecessary [[use of energy]]. This category includes eliminating waste by turning off unneeded lights and appliances and by avoiding unnecessary [[travelling|journeys]]. [[Heat loss]] from buildings is a major source of energy wastage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bartlett|first=Dave|title=The Top Ten Ways We Waste Energy And Water In Buildings|url=http://energy.aol.com/2011/07/26/the-top-ten-ways-we-waste-energy-and-water-in-buildings/|publisher=AOL Energy|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  so improvements to building insulation and air-tightness can make a significant contribution to energy conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems|url=http://www.ecbcs.org/home.htm|work=About the ECBCS|publisher=International Energy Agency|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have agencies to encourage [[energy saving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United Kingdom|title=Energy Saving Trust|url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/|publisher=The Energy Saving Trust|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==
The second priority under the energy hierarchy is to ensure that energy that is used is produced and consumed efficiently. [[Energy efficiency (physics)|Energy efficiency]] has two main aspects.

===Conversion efficiency of energy consumption===
{{main article|Efficient energy use}}
Energy efficiency is the ratio of the productive output of a device to the energy it consumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy efficiency definition and meaning|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/energy-efficiency.html|work=Business Dictionary|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficiency was a lower priority when energy was cheap and awareness of its environmental impact was low. In 1975 the average fuel economy of a car in the US was under 15 miles per gallon&lt;ref name=EPA_vehicles&gt;{{cite web|title=Light-Duty Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends: 1975 Through 2011|url=http://www.epa.gov/otaq/cert/mpg/fetrends/2012/420r12001a.pdf|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incandescent light bulbs, which were the most common type until the late 20th century, waste 90% of their energy as heat, with only 10% converted to useful light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learn about LEDs|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=lighting.pr_what_are|publisher=Energy Star|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, energy efficiency has become a priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Energy savings to be first policy priority for 2030|url=http://www.energy-cities.eu/IMG/pdf/20121120_press_release_Coalition_call_for_2030_energy_savings.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2013|newspaper=Energy Cities (Europe)|date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last reported average fuel efficiency of US cars had almost doubled from the 1975 level;&lt;ref name=EPA_vehicles /&gt; LED lighting is now being promoted which are between five and ten times more efficient than incandescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LED basics|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ssl/sslbasics_ledbasics.html#how_efficient|work=Solid State Lighting|publisher=USDOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many household appliances are now required to display [[Energy input labeling|labels]] to show their energy efficiency.

===Conversion efficiency of energy production===
{{main article|Energy conversion efficiency}}
Losses are incurred when energy is harvested from the natural resource from which it is derived, such as fossil fuels, radioactive materials, solar radiation or other sources. Most electricity production is in thermal power stations, where much of the source energy is lost as heat. The average efficiency of world electricity production in 2009 was c.37%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Energy Balance for the World|url=http://www.iea.org/stats/balancetable.asp?COUNTRY_CODE=29|publisher=International Energy Agency|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A priority in the Energy Hierarchy is to improve the efficiency of energy conversion, whether in traditional power stations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficiency in electricity generation|url=http://www.eurelectric.org/Download/Download.aspx?DocumentID=13549|publisher=Eurelectric|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by improving the [[Photovoltaic power station#System performance|performance ratio]] of [[Photovoltaic power stations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012|url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/de/downloads/pdf-files/aktuelles/photovoltaics-report.pdf|work=Photovoltaics Report|publisher=Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other energy sources.

Overall efficiency and sustainability can also be improved by capacity- or [[Climate change mitigation#Fuel switching|fuel-switching]] from less efficient, less sustainable resources to better ones; but this is mainly covered under the [[#Low impact energy production|fourth level]] of the hierarchy.

==Sustainable energy production==
{{main article|Renewable energy}}
Renewable energy describes naturally occurring, theoretically inexhaustible sources of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Renewable Energy|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/renewable-energy.html|publisher=Business Dictionary|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sources are treated as being inexhaustible, or naturally replenished, and fall into two classes.

===Elemental renewables===
The first class of renewables derive from climatic or elemental sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy |url=http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/students/options/sectors/energy/renewable/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419123506/http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/students/options/sectors/energy/renewable/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-19 |publisher=Manchester University |accessdate=23 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as sunlight, wind, waves, tides or rainfall ([[hydropower]]). [[Geothermal energy]] from the heat of the earth's core also falls in this category.

These are treated as being inexhaustible because most derive ultimately from energy emanating from the [[sun]], which has an estimated life of 6.5 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Sun's lifetime going to be?|url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/ask/a10395.html|work=Ask the space scientist|publisher=NASA|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bio-energy===
The other main class of renewables, [[bioenergy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Renewable Energy|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/tech/home|publisher=Renewable Energy World|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; derives from biomass, where the relatively short growing cycle means that usage is replenished by new growth. Bioenergy is usually converted by combustion, and therefore gives rise to carbon emissions. It is treated as carbon neutral overall, because an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide will have been extracted from the atmosphere during the growing cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pingoud|first=Kim|title=Harvested Wood Products|volume=4|series=IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories|url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_12_Ch12_HWP.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioenergy sources can be solid, such as wood and [[energy crop]]s; liquid, such as biofuels; or gaseous, such as biomethane from anaerobic digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is bioenergy?|url=http://www.bioenergywiki.net/What_is_bioenergy|publisher=Bioenergy Wiki|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low impact energy production==
{{main article|Low carbon power}}
The next priority in the hierarchy covers energy sources that are not entirely sustainable, but have a low environmental impact. These include the use of fossil fuels with [[carbon capture and storage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon dioxide capture and storage|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_technicalsummary.pdf|work=Technical Report|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear energy is sometimes treated as a low impact source, because it has low carbon emissions.

==High impact energy production==

The lowest priority under the energy hierarchy is energy production using unsustainables sources, such as unabated fossil fuels. Some also place nuclear energy in this category, rather than the one above, because of the required management/storage of highly hazardous [[radioactive waste]] over extremely long (hundreds of thousands of years or more) timeframes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sovacool|first=Benjamin|title=Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power|year=2011|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=978-981-4322-75-1|pages=308|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/7895}}&lt;/ref&gt; and depletion of uranium resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Choi|first=Charles|title=Uranium Supply Decline Clouds Nuclear Power's Future|url=http://www.livescience.com/2463-uranium-supply-decline-clouds-nuclear-power-future.html|publisher=World Science|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a consensus that the share of such energy sources must decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An energy vision for a planet under pressure|url=http://www.igbp.net/publications/policybriefsforrio20summit/policybriefsforrio20summit/anenergyvisionforaplanetunderpressure.5.7edb9cae136f47276108000494.html|publisher=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this tier, there are possibilities for limiting adverse impacts by [[Climate change mitigation#Fuel switching|switching]] from the most damaging fuel sources, such as coal, to less emissive sources, such as gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Salovaara|first=Jackson|title=Coal to Natural Gas Fuel Switching and CO2 Emissions Reduction|work=Harvard |year=2011|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/hepg/Papers/2011/Salovaara_SeniorThesis_FINAL.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many suggest that when such high impact energy usage has been minimised, the effects of any unavoidable residual usage should be counterbalanced by emissions [[offsetting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liyanage|first=Chandratilak De Silva|title=Sustainable Energy Management and CSR|series=Encyclopedia of Corporate Social Responsibility|url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/343555.html|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the energy hierarchy==

The '''Language Strife''' ({{lang-sv|Finska språkstriden|lit=Finnish language dispute}}) was a major conflict in mid-19th century [[History of Finland|Finland]]. Both the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] languages were commonly used in Finland at the time, associated with descendants of Swedish colonisation and leading to class tensions among the speakers of the different languages. It became acute in the mid-19th century. The competition was considered to have officially ended when Finnish gained [[official language]] status in 1923 and became equal to the Swedish language.

== Background ==
{{Main|History of Finland}}
{{See also|Finland under Swedish rule}}
Finland had once been under Swedish rule ([[Sweden-Finland]]). [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (with some [[Latin]]) was the language of administration and education in the [[Swedish Realm]]. Swedish was therefore the most-used language of administration and higher education among the Finns. To gain higher education, one had to learn Swedish, and Finnish was considered by the upper classes to be a "language of peasants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aleksiskivi-kansalliskirjailija.fi/elama/elamakerta/ | title = Aleksis Kivi - Kansalliskirjailija | access-date = 2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://opinnot.internetix.fi/fi/muikku2materiaalit/lukio/hi/hi3/2_autonominen_suomi/12_kielen_asema | title = Suomen kielen asema | author = Minna Helminen | publisher = Otavan Opisto | access-date = 2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration of Swedish peasants to Finland's coastal regions also boosted the status of Swedish by sheer number of speakers. Although [[Mikael Agricola]] had started written Finnish with ''[[Abckiria]]'' in the 1500s, and a Finnish translation of the [[Civil Code of 1734]] was published in 1759 (''Ruotzin waldacunnan laki''), it had no official status as a legal publication since the official language of administration was Swedish.&lt;ref name="skvkkh" /&gt;

As a result of the [[Finnish War]], Sweden ceded Finland to [[Russia]] in 1809. Finland became the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] within the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="gmsprengtbio"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kansallisbiografia.fi/kansallisbiografia/henkilo/602 | title = Sprengtporten, Georg Magnus (1740 - 1819) | website = Biografiakeskus | access-date = 2017-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Russian rule, the laws of the Sweden–Finland era remained largely unchanged, and Swedish continued to be used in administration.&lt;ref name="skvkkh"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://journal.fi/tt/article/download/616/506/ | title = Suomen kieli vallan kielenä | author = Kaisa Häkkinen | format = PDF | access-date = 2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language strife became more acute in the second half of the 19th century. [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman]], a Swede who wished to increase education in Finland, became a chief initiator of conflict in the 1850s due to his concern about the changing language use among the educated classes, many of whom were using Russian or Finnish.&lt;ref name="snellmanbiografia"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://kansallisbiografia.fi/english/person/3639 |title= Snellman, Johan Vilhelm (1806 - 1881) |author= Matti Klinge |date= |website= The National Biography of Finland |publisher= |access-date=2017-11-24 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote to [[Zachris Topelius]] in 1860: "My view is this: Whether Russian or Finnish will win, only God knows. I dare not hope for anything. But that Swedish will lose - that I do know."&lt;ref name="snellmanbiografia" /&gt; [[Elias Lönnrot]] compiled the first Finnish-Swedish dictionary (''Finsk-Svenskt lexikon''), completing it in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kansallisbiografia.fi/kansallisbiografia/henkilo/2836 | title = Lönnrot, Elias (1802 - 1884) | publisher = Biografiakeskus | access-date = 2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nationalism and the question of language ==
[[File:Kiianmies Kyander graves Tampere 20090818.JPG|thumb|right|A set of graves in Tampere, showing the Swedish surname 'Kyander' as well as the Fennicized 'Kiianmies']]

The rise of [[Fennoman]]ic Finnish [[nationalism]] in the 19th century eventually led to the revived predominance of Finnish use in the country. A significant contribution to the Finnish national awakening from the mid-19th century onward came from the members of the mostly [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking]] upper classes deliberately choosing to promote Finnish culture and language. Snellman was himself was an ethnic Swede and was later ennobled.  These [[Finnish Swedes]], known as the [[Fennomans]], [[Fennicization|Fennicized]] their family names, learned Finnish, and made a point of using Finnish both in public and at home. However, another group of the Swedish-speaking population, the [[Svecomans]], did not wish to abandon Swedish and opposed the Fennoman ideology and Fennoman-inspired reforms.

In 1863 [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] (AsK 26/1863) ruled that Finnish had an [[official language]] status comparable to that of Swedish; it could thereafter be used in an official capacity in legal and state office matters.&lt;ref name="kasf"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://suomifinland100.fi/project/1863-kieliasetus/ | title = 1863 kieliasetus | access-date = 2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ylevierailu" /&gt;&lt;ref name=haar&gt;{{cite book|author=Harald Haarmann |title=Modern Finland: Portrait of a Flourishing Society |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9781476625652 |page=211 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KEA4DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a generation, the Finnish language use gained predominance in the government and the society of Finland. 

During the [[Russification of Finland]], Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] attempted to change the official language to Russian (''Language Manifesto of 1900''), but Russification was halted by the [[Finnish general strike of 1905|general strike of 1905]].

== After independence ==
After [[Independence of Finland|Finland gained independence]] in 1917, its relations with Sweden unexpectedly became strained in connection with the [[Finnish Civil War]] and the [[Åland crisis]]. These events aggravated the language dispute, and the controversy over Swedish and Finnish became a prominent feature of domestic politics during the 1920s and 1930s.

In the newly independent [[Constitution of Finland|Finnish constitution]] of 1919, Finnish and Swedish were given equal status as national languages. The language strife thereafter centered on this and on the role of Swedish in universities, particularly regarding the number of professors who spoke and wrote in Swedish in their teaching. In the [[interwar period]], the [[University of Helsinki]] was the scene of conflict between those who wanted to advance the use of Finnish and those who wished to maintain the use of Swedish.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uppslagsverket.fi/sv/sok/view-103684-Universitetsadresserna |title=Universitetsadresserna |author=Lasse Sundman |date=2011-04-24 |website=[[Uppslagsverket Finland]] |publisher= |access-date=2017-11-30 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographer [[Väinö Tanner (geographer)|Väinö Tanner]] was one of the most vocal defenders of Swedish.&lt;ref name=UppslagsverketFi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uppslagsverket.fi/sv/sok/view-103684-TannerVaeinoe |title=Tanner, Väinö |author=Johan Lindberg |date=2011-08-05 |website=[[Uppslagsverket Finland]] |publisher= |access-date=2017-11-30 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; A campaign initiated by the [[Swedish People's Party of Finland]] collected 153,914 signatures in defense of Swedish in a petition that was presented  to the parliament and government in October 1934.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv/&gt; The conflict at the university generated an international reaction when academics from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland sent letters to the diplomatic representatives of Finland in their respective countries warning that diminishing the role of Swedish at the university would result in a weakening of Nordic unity.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv/&gt;

The government issued a language decree on 1 January 1923 making Finnish and Swedish equal in status.&lt;ref name="ylevierailu"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2013/06/11/keisarivierailu-vauhditti-yhteiskunnan-muutosta | title = Keisarivierailu vauhditti yhteiskunnan muutosta | author = Rita Trötschkes | publisher = Yle | date = 2013-12-09 | access-date = 2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
During the resettlement of more than 420,000 [[Karelia]]n refugees after the [[Winter War]] against the Soviet Union (1939–1940), the Swedish-speaking minority feared that the new Finnish-speaking settlers would change the linguistic balance of their neighborhoods. Since the late 20th century, there has been discussion of whether the policy of [[mandatory Swedish]] classes in schools should continue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3246">'''Genetic exceptionalism''' is the belief that genetic information is special and so must be treated differently from other types of medical data or other personally identifiable information.  

For example, patients are able to obtain information about their [[blood pressure]] without involving any medical professionals, but to obtain information about their genetic profile might require an order from a physician and expensive counseling sessions. Disclosure of an individual's genetic information or its meaning, such as telling a woman with red hair that she has a higher risk of skin cancer, has been legally restricted in some places, as providing [[medical advice]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Turna. 18 August 2010.  [http://www.genomeweb.com/dxpgx/uc-berkeley-halts-genetic-testing-program-touts-opportunity-ethical-debate UC Berkeley Halts Genetic Testing Program, but Touts Opportunity for Ethical Debate] ''Pharmacogenomics Reporter''.&lt;/ref&gt;

That policy approach has been taken by state legislatures to safeguard individuals' genetic information in the [[United States]] from individuals, their families, their employers, and the government. The approach builds upon the existing protection required of general health information provided by such laws as the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]].

== Expert Debate ==

There is ongoing debate over whether or when certain genetic information should be considered exceptional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=James P|last2=Burke|first2=Wylie|date=July 2008|title=Genetic exceptionalism. Too much of a good thing?|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1097/GIM.0b013e31817f280a|journal=Genetics in Medicine|language=En|volume=10|issue=7|pages=500–501|doi=10.1097/gim.0b013e31817f280a|issn=1098-3600}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the predictive power of genetic information (such as a risk for a disease like [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]], which is highly penetrant) may justify special considerations for genetic exceptionalism, in that individuals with a high risk for developing this condition may face a certain amount of discrimination. However, for most common human health conditions, a specific genetic variant only plays a partial role, interacting with other genetic variants and environmental and lifestyle influences to contribute to disease development. In these cases, genetic information is often considered similarly to other medical and lifestyle data, such as smoking status, age, or [[Biomarker|biomarkers]].

'''Haraç'''  ({{lang-hy|խարջ / kharj}}, {{lang-mk|arač / арач}}, {{lang-gr|χαράτσι / charatsi}}, {{lang-sh|харач / harač}}) was a land tax levied on [[non-Muslim]]s in the [[Ottoman Empire]].

''Haraç'' was developed from an earlier form of land taxation, ''[[kharaj]]'' (''harac''), and was, in principle, only payable by non-Muslims; it was seen as a counterpart to [[zakat]] paid by [[Muslims]].&lt;ref name =Hunter&gt;Hunter, Malik and Senturk, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; The ''haraç'' system later merged into the [[cizye]] taxation system.

Haraç collection was reformed by a [[firman]] of 1834, which abolished the old levying system, and required that ''haraç'' be raised by a commission composed of the [[kadı]] and the ''ayans'', or municipal chiefs of ''[[Rayah|rayas]]'' in each district. The firman made several other changes to taxation.

'''Hypostasis''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''hypo-'' "below" + ''stasis'' "standing") is the essence of [[metafiction]], a rare, literary moment when characters in fiction become aware of their own fictional nature.

==Debut==
The debut of hypostasis in literature occurs in ''[[Don Quixote]]'', Part 2, Chapter 2, when Sancho announces to Don Quixote that a book has been written about their adventures. Thus, these literary characters become aware that they are literary characters. This scene so impressed [[Jorge Luis Borges]] that he devoted one of his most famous essays to it: '''Partial Enchantments in the Quixote.''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'"&lt;ref&gt;''The Cervantes Encyclopedia'' [2 volumes] by Howard Mancing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==
In Disney's 1977 animated movie, ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'', Tigger bounces himself to the top of a tree and is then afraid to climb down. This image of Tigger in the treetop is revealed to the viewer to be merely an illustration in a book when Sebastian Cabot, the movie's narrator, says, "Well Tigger, your bouncing really got you into trouble this time." Tigger, surrounded by the words of the story on the page around him, looks directly into the camera and says, "Say, who are you?" "I'm the narrator," answers Cabot. "Well please, for goodness' sakes, narrate me down from here!" pleads Tigger.

Cartoonist Bill Watterson of ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' bridges into hypostasis in 1992 when Calvin, a cartoon,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2012/04/29/&lt;/ref&gt; draws a cartoon of himself and then criticizes his own lack of ability to draw.

A notable excursion into hypostasis is featured in Tom Stoppard's screenplay for the 1990 movie, ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', in which two minor characters from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Hamlet]] wrestle with the growing realization that they are undifferentiated minor characters in a work of fiction.

'''In-group favoritism''', sometimes known as '''in-group–out-group bias''', '''in-group bias''', or '''intergroup bias''', is a pattern of favoring members of one's [[Ingroups and outgroups|in-group]] over out-group members. This can be expressed in evaluation of others, in allocation of resources, and in many other ways.&lt;ref name=aronson&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., &amp; Akert, R. (2010).

This interaction has been researched by many [[psychologist]]s and linked to many theories related to [[group conflict]] and [[prejudice]]. The phenomenon is primarily viewed from a [[social psychology]] standpoint. Studies have shown that in-group favoritism arises as a result of the formation of cultural groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Efferson|first=Charles|last2=Lalive|first2=Rafael|last3=Fehr|first3=Ernst|date=2008-09-26|title=The Coevolution of Cultural Groups and Ingroup Favoritism|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5897/1844|journal=Science|language=en|volume=321|issue=5897|pages=1844–1849|doi=10.1126/science.1155805|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18818361|bibcode=2008Sci...321.1844E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fu|first=Feng|last2=Tarnita|first2=Corina E.|last3=Christakis|first3=Nicholas A.|last4=Wang|first4=Long|last5=Rand|first5=David G.|last6=Nowak|first6=Martin A.|date=2012-06-21|title=Evolution of in-group favoritism|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep00460|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=2|pages=460|doi=10.1038/srep00460|issn=2045-2322|pmc=3380441|pmid=22724059|bibcode=2012NatSR...2E.460F}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cultural groups can be divided based on seemingly trivial observable traits, but with time, populations grow to associate certain traits with certain behaviour, increasing covariation. This then incentivises in-group bias.

Two prominent theoretical approaches to the phenomenon of in-group favoritism are [[realistic conflict theory]] and [[social identity theory]]. Realistic conflict theory proposes that intergroup competition, and sometimes intergroup conflict, arises when two groups have opposing claims to scarce resources. In contrast, social identity theory posits a psychological drive for [[Social identity theory#Positive distinctiveness|positively distinct]] social identities as the general root cause of in-group favoring behavior.

==Origins of the research tradition==

In 1906, the sociologist [[William Graham Sumner|William Sumner]] posited that humans are a species that join together in groups by their very nature. However, he also maintained that humans had an innate tendency to favor their own group over others, proclaiming how "each group nourishes its own pride and vanity, boasts itself superior, exists in its own divinities, and looks with contempt on outsiders" (p.&amp;nbsp;13).&lt;ref&gt;Sumner, William Graham. (1906). ''Folkways: A Study of the Social Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals''. Boston, MA: Ginn.&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen on the group level with ingroup–outgroup bias. When experienced in larger groups such as tribes, [[ethnic group]]s, or nations, it is referred to as [[ethnocentrism]].

==Explanations==

===Competition===
Realistic conflict theory (or realistic group conflict) posits that competition between groups for resources is the cause of in-group bias and the corresponding negative treatment of members of the out-group. Muzafer Sherif's [[Robbers Cave experiment|Robbers Cave Experiment]] is the most widely known demonstration of realistic conflict theory. In the experiment, 22 eleven-year-old boys with similar backgrounds were studied in a mock summer camp situation, with researchers posing as camp personnel.

The boys were divided into two equal groups and encouraged to bond, with the aim of fostering an in-group mentality. The researchers then introduced a series of competitive activities which pitted groups against each other for a valuable prize. Hostility and out-group negativity ensued.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Sherif, M.; Harvey, O.J.; White, B.J.; Hood, W. &amp; Sherif, C.W. (1961). ''Intergroup Conflict and Cooperation: The Robbers Cave Experiment''. Norman, OK: The University Book Exchange. pp. 155–184.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, researchers attempted to reverse the hostility by engaging the boys in situations of mutual interdependence, an effort which eventually resulted in relative harmony between the two groups.

Sherif concluded from this experiment that negative attitudes toward out-groups arises when groups compete for limited resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, he also theorised that [[Group conflict|inter-group frictions]] could be reduced and positive relations created,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but only in the presence of an all-encompassing goal which could only be achieved with the two groups cooperation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aronson" /&gt;

===Self-esteem===
According to [[social identity theory]], one of the key determinants of group biases is the need to improve [[self-esteem]]. The desire to view one's self positively is transferred onto the group, creating a tendency to view one's own group in a positive light, and by comparison, outside groups in a negative light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social categorization and similarity in intergroup behaviour|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2420030103/abstract|journal = European Journal of Social Psychology|date = 1973-01-01|issn = 1099-0992|pages = 27–52|volume = 3|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2420030103|first = Michael|last = Billig|first2 = Henri|last2 = Tajfel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, individuals will find a reason, no matter how insignificant, to prove to themselves why their own group is superior. This phenomenon was pioneered and studied most extensively by [[Henri Tajfel]], a British social psychologist who looked at the psychological root of in-group/out-group bias. To study this in the lab, Tajfel and colleagues created what are now known as minimal groups (see [[minimal group paradigm]]), which occur when "complete strangers are formed into groups using the most trivial criteria imaginable". In Tajfel's studies, participants were split into groups by flipping a coin, and each group then was told to appreciate a certain style of painting none of the participants were familiar with when the experiment began. What Tajfel and his colleagues discovered was that—regardless of the facts that a) participants did not know each other, b) their groups were completely meaningless, and c) none of the participants had any inclination as to which "style" they like better—participants almost always "liked the members of their own group better and they rated the members of their in-group as more likely to have pleasant personalities". By having a more positive impression of individuals in the in-group, individuals are able to boost their own self-esteem as members of that group.&lt;ref name=aronson/&gt;

[[Robert Cialdini]] and his research team looked at the number of university T-shirts being worn on college campuses following either a win or loss at the football game. They found that the Monday after a win, there were more T-shirts being worn, on average, than following a loss.&lt;ref name=aronson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cialdini|first= Robert B.|last2= Borden|first2= Richard J.|last3= Thorne|first3= Avril|last4= Walker|first4= Marcus Randall|last5= Freeman|first5= Stephen|last6= Sloan|first6= Lloyd Reynolds|date= 1974|title= Basking in Reflected Glory: Three (Football) Field Studies|url= |journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|publisher= |volume= 34|issue= 3|pages= 366–375|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.34.3.366 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In another set of studies, done in the 1980s by [[Jennifer Crocker]] and colleagues, self-esteem was studied using minimal group processes in which it was shown that individuals with high self-esteem who suffer a threat to the self-concept exhibit greater ingroup biases than people with low self-esteem who suffer a threat to the self-concept.&lt;ref name=crocker1987&gt;{{cite journal |last= Crocker|first= Jennifer|last2= Thompson|first2= Leigh L.|last3= McGraw|first3= Kathleen M.|last4= Ingerman|first4= Cindy|date= May 1987|title= Downward Comparison, Prejudice, and Evaluations of Others: Effects of Self-Esteem and Threat|url= |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|publisher= |volume= 52|issue= 5|pages= 907–916|issn= 0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.5.907}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While some studies have supported this notion of a negative correlation between self-esteem and in-group bias,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Abrams|first= Dominic|last2= Hogg|first2= Michael A.|date= 1988|title= Comments on the motivational status of self-esteem in social identity and intergroup discrimination|url= |journal= [[European Journal of Social Psychology]]|publisher= |volume= 18|issue= 4|pages= 317–334|doi= 10.1002/ejsp.2420180403}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; other researchers have found that individuals with low self-esteem have a higher prejudice to both in-group and out-group members.&lt;ref name=crocker1987 /&gt; Some studies have even shown that high-self-esteem groups showed a greater prejudice than did lower self-esteem groups.&lt;ref name="Sachdev, I. 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Sachdev|first= Itesh|last2= Bourhis|first2= Richard Y.|date= September 1987|title= Status differentials and intergroup behaviour|url= |journal= European Journal of Social Psychology|publisher= |volume= 17|issue= 3|pages= 277–293|doi= 10.1002/ejsp.2420170304}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This research may suggest that there is an alternative explanation and additional reasoning as to the relationship between self-esteem and in-group/out-group biases.

=== Biological basis as an effect of oxytocin ===
{{Main|Oxytocin}}
In a meta-analysis and review of the effect of oxytocin on social behavior done by [[Carsten De Dreu]], the research reviewed shows that oxytocin enables the development of trust, specifically towards individuals with similar characteristics - categorised as 'in-group' members - promoting cooperation with and favoritism towards such individuals.&lt;ref name="De Dreu2012"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Oxytocin modulates cooperation within and competition between groups: An integrative review and research agenda|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=61|issue=3|pages=419–428|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2011.12.009|issn=0018-506X|last1=De Dreu|first1=Carsten K.W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bias of oxytocin-induced goodwill towards those with features and characteristics perceived to be similar may have evolved as a biological basis for sustaining in-group cooperation and protection, fitting with the Darwinian insight that acts of self-sacrifice and cooperation contribute to the functioning of the group and hence improve the odd of survival for members of said group.&lt;ref name="De Dreu2012" /&gt;

Race can be used as an example of in-group and out-group tendencies because society often categorizes individuals into groups based on race (Caucasian, African American, Latino, etc.). One study that examined race and [[empathy]] found that participants receiving nasally administered oxytocin had stronger reactions to pictures of in-group members making pained faces than to pictures of out-group members with the same expression.&lt;ref name="pmid23246533"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheng F, Liu Y, Zhou B, Zhou W, Han S | title = Oxytocin modulates the racial bias in neural responses to others' suffering | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 92 | issue = 2 | pages = 380–6 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23246533 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2012.11.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that oxytocin may be implicated in our ability to empathize with individuals of different races, with individuals of one race potentially biased towards helping individuals of the same race than individuals of another race when they are experiencing pain.

Oxytocin has also been implicated in [[Lie|lying]] when lying would prove beneficial to other in-group members.  In a study where such a relationship was examined, it was found that when individuals were administered oxytocin, rates of [[dishonesty]] in the participants' responses increased for their in-group members when a beneficial outcome for their group was expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shalvi S, De Dreu CK | title = Oxytocin promotes group-serving dishonesty | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 15 | pages = 5503–7 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24706799 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1400724111 | pmc=3992689| bibcode = 2014PNAS..111.5503S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these examples show the tendency to act in ways that benefit people with which one feels is part of their social group, or in-group.

=== Self-identity and social identity ===
{{Main|Social identity theory}}
As noted in two recent theoretical reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hogg|first=Michael A.|last2=Terry|first2=Deborah J.|last3=White|first3=Katherine M.|date=1995-01-01|title=A Tale of Two Theories: A Critical Comparison of Identity Theory with Social Identity Theory|jstor=2787127|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|volume=58|issue=4|pages=255–269|doi=10.2307/2787127}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theoretical basis for the inclusion of self-identity in the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior has many similarities to social identity theory &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tajfel|first=Henri|date=1974-04-01|title=Social identity and intergroup behaviour|url=http://ssi.sagepub.com/content/13/2/65|journal=Social Science Information|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=65–93|doi=10.1177/053901847401300204|issn=0539-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its extension, self-categorization theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Group Processes: Theory and Research, Vol.2|last=Turner|first=John C.|publisher=JAI|year=1985|isbn=|location=Greenwichm, CT|pages=77–122|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to social identity theory, an important component of the self-concept is derived from memberships in social groups and categories. When people define and evaluate themselves in terms of a self-inclusive social category (e.g. a sex, class, team) two processes come into play : (1) categorization, which perceptually accentuates differences between in-group and out-group, and similarities among in-group members (including self) on stereotypical dimensions; and (2) self-enhancement which, because the self-concept is defined in terms of group membership, seeks behaviorally and perceptually to favor the in-group over the out-group. Social identities are cognitively represented as group prototypes that describe and prescribe beliefs, attitudes, feelings and behaviors that optimize a balance between minimization of in-group differences and maximization of intergroup differences.

More specifically, according to social identity theory, there is a continuum between personal and social identity shifts along this continuum that determine the extent to which group-related or personal characteristics influence a person's feelings and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Psychology of Intergroup Relations|last=Tajfel, Henri, John C. Turner|publisher=Brooks-Cole|year=1979|isbn=|location=Brooks-Cole|pages=33–47|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a particular social identity is a salient basis for self-conception, then the self is assimilated to the perceived in-group prototype which can be thought of as a set of perceived in-group norms such that self-perception, beliefs, attitudes, feelings and behaviours are defined in terms of the group prototype. Thus, social identities should influence behaviour through the mediating role of group norms. People will be more likely to engage in a particular behaviour if it is in accord with the norms of a behaviourally relevant group membership, particularly if the identity is a salient basis for self-definition. If the group membership is not salient, then people's behaviour and feelings should be in accord with their own personal and idiosyncratic characteristics rather than group norms.

On the other hand, the self-identity theory poses that the self is often a reflection of expected norms and practices in the role that the person places him/herself in. At the center of it is the proposition that the self is made up of multi-faceted and differentiated components that exist in an organized manner  for the sake of filling in roles in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality, Roles, and Social Behavior|author1=Stryker, Sheldon |author2=Richard T. Serpe|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1982|isbn=|location=New York|pages=188–218|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People are able to create an identity for themselves only through talking to others, and often what roles they are taking on differ from one group to another. These differing roles and positions people fill are a result of their interactions with others and are called role identities. Role identities may be self-realized or facts like being a mother, a social worker, or a blood donor. Role identities lead people to act in certain ways due to assumed expectations for the roles. Because there is satisfaction in complying with expectations of the role, there is often distress behind an inability to appear congruent to one's identity as defined by societal norms. There is also an existing hierarchy of importance for roles that individuals take on, and according to the hierarchical standing of roles, people become more representative of roles that stand higher hierarchically, according to them.

Identity salience, the likelihood of role identities being invoked in different situations, is the result of role identities being placed hierarchically in different orders from person to person. People who hold the same roles may act differently because some roles are valued over others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology Quarterly|author1=Nuttbrock, Larry |author2=Patricia Freudiger|publisher=|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=146–157|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a working mother may have less time to spend with her child as opposed to a mother that doesn't work. Behaviors are reflective of the identities that are held higher hierarchically by people, so people act out in self-worth and self-meaning according to these hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology Quarterly 48|last=Callero|first=Peter|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=203–215|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Someone who holds the identity of being a psychologist higher than the identity of being a linguist will find that while he/she may become competitive when meeting another person that is better at psychology than he/she, he/she won't care when in contact with someone who is much better at being a linguist than he/she. In a similar way, social relationships are influenced by this salience. Self-identity often places individuals in social contexts and a commitment to the role within that context becomes a big part of perpetrating the idea of self. It also finds people relating more to others that hold similar role identities at the top of their hierarchies.

Because people have self-concepts that are derived from a role they define for themselves within the context of a group, when staying within their roles, intergroup similarities are accentuated while intergroup differences are diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=British Journal of Psychology 50|last=Tajfel|first=Henri|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=16–29|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to assimilate oneself according to the tendencies of a group, often people reconfigure their intragroup representations or identities. Certain prototypes form about these groups that reaffirm rules that members of the group are encouraged to follow. Shared information and views are discussed more often than novel and unshared information within a group, therefore a norm is established where the majority views are perpetuated and others silenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|last=Larson, J. R., Jr., Foster-Fishman, P. G., &amp; Keys, C. B.|publisher=|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=446–461|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This norm is fluid and changing according to different contexts, but those within the group who want to keep up with the majority views in all matters have to keep an active role in affirming the views of the in-group in contest to out-groups.

== Evolution of in-groups ==

=== Formation of cultural groups ===
Studies have shown that in-group favoritism arises endogenously, through the formation of [[cultural group]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Symbolic markers in certain conditions can result in trivial groupings developing into cultural groups. The formation of such cultural groups then results in a higher degree of in-group favoritism.

Efferson, Lalive and Fehr published such a study in 2008, utilising a series of [[coordination game]]s to mimic cooperation between individuals. The study found that cultural groups were able to form endogenously through creation of a linkage between a payoff-relevant behaviour and a payoff-irrelevant marker. Subsequently, in-group favouritism occurred in ensuing social interactions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Participants were first divided into one of several populations of 10 people, and then further divided into subpopulations of 5. Each group had different payoff for coordinating on one of 2 choices, behaviour A or behaviour B. In group 1, participants were awarded 41 points for coordinating (choosing A themselves and choosing another participant who also chose A) on A and 21 for coordinating on B. The payoffs were switched in the 2nd group. In both groups participants were awarded just 1 point for mis-coordinating. During each turn participants were also allowed to choose a payoff-irrelevant marker (circle or triangle). Players from both subpopulations were mixed to create a coordination problem, and every turn, an unidentified player from each subpopulation would be randomly switched.

The experiment created a situation in which participants were strongly incentivised to develop a sense of expected behaviours in his or her subpopulation, but occasionally would find themselves in a totally new situation in which their behaviours were not in-line with [[Norm (social)|social norms]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The results showed that players generally developed an inclination to pair behaviour with a marker, especially if it had resulted in a positive payoff. As linkages at an individual level increase, [[covariation]] (of marker and behaviour) at an aggregate level also increases. In the experiment, there was a significant increase in participants requesting for partners with the same-shape choice as it progressed, although the initial choice of shape had no effect on payoffs. Toward the end of the experiment, this number stood at a substantial 87%, indicating the presence of in-group favouritism.

Their study supported the thesis that the formation of cultural groups alters selective pressure facing individuals, and thus leads to certain behavioural traits being advantageous.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, if such selective pressures were present in past civilisations, where membership in a certain group is correlated with a certain behavioural norm, the emergence of in-group biases where it is beneficial to act in differing manners to members of the same group is certainly plausible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Gender differences ==

=== Automatic bias for own gender ===
{{harvtxt|Rudman|Goodwin|2004}} conducted research on [[gender bias]] that measured gender preferences without directly asking the participants. Subjects at [[Purdue]] and [[Rutgers]] participated in computerized tasks that measured automatic attitudes based on how quickly a person categorizes pleasant and unpleasant attributes with each gender. Such a task was done to discover whether people associate pleasant words (good, happy, and sunshine) with women, and unpleasant words (bad, trouble, and pain) with men.&lt;ref name="googleusercontent.com1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://rutgerssocialcognitionlab.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/9/7/13979590/rudmangoodwin2004jpsp.pdf |last1=Rudman |first1=Laurie A. |last2=Goodwin |first2=Stephanie A. |year=2004 |title=Gender differences in automatic in-group bias: Why do women like women more than men like men? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=87 |pages=494–509 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.4.494 |issue=4 |pmid=15491274 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718210210/http://rutgerssocialcognitionlab.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/9/7/13979590/rudmangoodwin2004jpsp.pdf |archivedate=July 18, 2014 |accessdate=September 2, 2016 |df=mdy|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This research found that while both women and men have more favorable views of women, women's in-group biases were 4.5 times stronger&lt;ref name="googleusercontent.com1"/&gt; than those of men and only women (not men) showed cognitive balance among in-group bias, identity, and self-esteem, revealing that men lack a mechanism that bolsters automatic preference for their own gender.&lt;ref name="googleusercontent.com1"/&gt;

=== Competition ===
Using a publics-goods game, Van Gugt, De Cremer, and P. Janssen (2016) found that men contributed more to their group in the face of outside competition from another group; there was no distinct difference amongst women's contributions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Van Vugt, M., De Cremer, D., P. Janssen, D. (2016) Gender Differences in Cooperation and Competition Psychological Science, Vol 18, Issue 1, pp. 19 – 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnicity-based favoritism ===
Fershtman and Gneezy (2001) found that men showed in-group biases in a [[Trust game|"trust" game]] based on ethnicity whereas this tendency was not present in women.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fershtman|first=Chaim|last2=Gneezy|first2=Uri|date=2001-02-01|title=Discrimination in a Segmented Society: An Experimental Approach|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/116/1/351/1939071/Discrimination-in-a-Segmented-Society-An|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=116|issue=1|pages=351–377|doi=10.1162/003355301556338|issn=0033-5533}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study aim to identify [[ethnic discrimination]] in [[Israelis|Israeli Jewish]] society, and was conducted on 996 Israeli undergraduates. Groups were separated based on whether the participants name was typically ethnically Eastern or [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]]. Similar to a dictator game, subjects were instructed to divide a sum of money (20 [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]]) between themselves and another player. Player A was told that any money sent over to Player B would be tripled, and Player B would receive details of the experiment, including the name of Player A and the transferred sum. Subsequently, Player B would have a choice of whether to send any money back.

The experiment found that despite sharing similar average transfer values (10.63 for women and 11.42 for men), women did not display significant in-group biases when it came to recipients with either Ashkenazic or Eastern sounding names. However, a bias against Eastern sounding names was present amongst men.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Furthermore, men showed more bias for Ashkenazic men compared to women, but the opposite was true for Eastern names.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This result may seem counter-intuitive as participants appear to share more in common if they were both male, thus we would expect Eastern females to be more marginalised, but is actually consistent with other studies which studied discrimination against Afro-American women.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Cynthia, "Positive Effects of the Multiple Negative: Explaining the Success of Black Professional Women," American Journal of Sociology, LXXVIII (1993), 150-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental age ===

Fehr, Bernhard, and Rockenbach (2008), in a study conducted on children, found that boys displayed in-group favouritism from ages 3–8 whereas girls did not display such tendencies.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fehr|first=Ernst|last2=Bernhard|first2=Helen|last3=Rockenbach|first3=Bettina|title=Egalitarianism in young children|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature07155|journal=Nature|volume=454|issue=7208|pages=1079–1083|doi=10.1038/nature07155|year=2008|bibcode=2008Natur.454.1079F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment involved usage of an "envy game", a modified version of the [[dictator game]]. A possible explanation posited by researchers relied on an evolutionary basis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

They theorised that [[parochialism]] and favouring members of the same group may have been particularly advantageous as it strengthened the individuals group position in intergroup conflicts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As males were the ones who were frequently at the forefront of such conflicts in the past, and thus bore the majority of the costs of conflicts in terms of injury or death, evolution may have favoured a greater sensitivity in males in situations which resulted in an advantageous payoff for their in-group. Thus males tended to show in-group biases from a younger age than females, as was evident in the experiment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A study conducted during the 2008 Presidential elections showcased how group identities were dynamic.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rand|first=David G.|last2=Pfeiffer|first2=Thomas|last3=Dreber|first3=Anna|last4=Sheketoff|first4=Rachel W.|last5=Wernerfelt|first5=Nils C.|last6=Benkler|first6=Yochai|date=2009-04-14|title=Dynamic remodeling of in-group bias during the 2008 presidential election|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/15/6187|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=15|pages=6187–6191|doi=10.1073/pnas.0811552106|issn=0027-8424|pmc=2664153|pmid=19332775|bibcode=2009PNAS..106.6187R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study carried out on 395 Democrats from Cambridge, MA, using an Economics [[dictator game]]. Subjects were given $6 to divide between themselves and another person. The recipients remained anonymous apart from which candidate they supported in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic Primaries]].

Data was collected in three separate periods. June 10 to 18th (after [[Hillary Clinton]]'s concession speech on June 7); August 9 to 14th, before the [[Democratic National Convention]] on the 25th; and September 2 to 5th, in the buildup to the Presidential elections. The results showed that men displayed significant in-group favouritism from June all the way to the DNC in August. This in-group bias however was not present in September. Women displayed no significant in-group favouritism throughout.

The experiment showed how group identities were flexible and could change over time.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Researchers theorised that in-group bias was strong in June as the competition to be the Democratic representative in the elections was still recent and thus salient. A lack of actual electoral conflict (against the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]) caused perception of salient groupings to remain throughout August.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Only in September did the in-group favouritism subside as a superordinate goal shared between groups was now present.

== Versus out-group negativity ==
{{Main|Group conflict}}
Social psychologists have long made the distinction between ingroup favouritism and outgroup negativity, where outgroup negativity is the act of punishing or placing burdens upon the outgroup.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."&gt;Tajfel, H., &amp; Turner, J. C. (1979). "An integrative theory of intergroup conflict". In W. G. Austin &amp; S. Worchel (Eds.), ''The social psychology of intergroup relations'' (pp. 33–47). Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, a significant body of research exists that attempts to identify the relationship between ingroup favouritism and outgroup negativity, as well as conditions that will lead to outgroup negativity.&lt;ref name="Bourhis &amp; Gagnon (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bourhis | first1 = R.

This theory also states that dissimilarity increases negative orientations towards others. When applied to [[Racism|racial discrimination]], the belief congruence theory argues that the perceived dissimilarity of beliefs has more of an impact on racial [[discrimination]] than does [[Race (human classification)|race]] itself.

Research finds evidence of in-group bias in police investigations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Jeremy |last=West |date=February 2018 |title=Racial Bias in Police Investigations |work=Working Paper |url=https://people.ucsc.edu/~jwest1/articles/West_RacialBiasPolice.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and judicial decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Briggs |last=Depew |first2=Ozkan |last2=Eren |first3=Naci |last3=Mocan |year=2017 |title=Judges, Juveniles, and In-Group Bias |journal=[[Journal of Law and Economics]] |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=209–239 |doi=10.1086/693822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological relationship ===
Oxytocin is not only correlated with the preferences of individuals to associate with members of their own group, but it is also evident during conflicts between members of different groups. During conflict, individuals receiving nasally administered oxytocin demonstrate more frequent defense-motivated responses toward in-group members than out-group members.  Further, oxytocin was correlated with participant desire to protect vulnerable in-group members, despite that individual's attachment to the conflict.&lt;ref name="pmid23144787"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Oxytocin motivates non-cooperation in intergroup conflict to protect vulnerable in-group members|journal=PLoS One|volume=7|issue=11|pages=e46751|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0046751|pmc=3492361|pmid=23144787|vauthors=De Dreu CK, Shalvi S, Greer LL, Van Kleef GA, Handgraaf MJ|bibcode=2012PLoSO...746751D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, it has been demonstrated that when oxytocin is administered, individuals alter their subjective preferences in order to align with in-group ideals over out-group ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=The herding hormone: oxytocin stimulates in-group conformity|journal=Psychological Science|volume=23|issue=11|pages=1288–92|doi=10.1177/0956797612446026|pmid=22991128|vauthors=Stallen M, De Dreu CK, Shalvi S, Smidts A, Sanfey AG}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies demonstrate that oxytocin is associated with intergroup dynamics.

Further, oxytocin influences the responses of individuals in a particular group to those of another group. The in-group bias is evident in smaller groups; however, it can also be extended to groups as large as one's entire country leading toward a tendency of strong national zeal. A study done in the Netherlands showed that oxytocin increased the in-group favoritism of their nation while decreasing acceptance of members of other ethnicities and foreigners.&lt;ref name="pmid21220339"&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 2011|title=Oxytocin promotes human ethnocentrism|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=108|issue=4|pages=1262–6|doi=10.1073/pnas.1015316108|pmc=3029708|pmid=21220339|vauthors=De Dreu CK, Greer LL, Van Kleef GA, Shalvi S, Handgraaf MJ|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.1262D}}&lt;/ref&gt; People also show more affection for their country's flag while remaining indifferent to other cultural objects when exposed to oxytocin.&lt;ref name="pmid25140135"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2014|title=Oxytocin increases liking for a country's people and national flag but not for other cultural symbols or consumer products|journal=Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience|volume=8|issue=|pages=266|doi=10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00266|pmc=4122242|pmid=25140135|vauthors=Ma X, Luo L, Geng Y, Zhao W, Zhang Q, Kendrick KM}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has thus been hypothesized that this hormone may be a factor in [[xenophobic]] tendencies secondary to this effect.  Thus, oxytocin appears to affect individuals at an international level where the in-group becomes a specific "home" country and the out-group grows to include all other countries.

==In-group derogation==
Cross-cultural studies have found that in-group derogation, the tendency to criticize members of one's own group or culture more harshly than members of outside groups, is more common among members of disadvantaged and minority groups than among members of the majority or dominant group. According to psychology professor Christine Ma-Kellams et al. (2011), [[system justification theory]] seeks to explain why "minorities sometimes endorse system-justifying views of their group". They said their research into in-group favoritism and derogation partially supported this theory, but that the theory failed to address all of the nuances.&lt;ref name=MaKellams/&gt;

Ma-Kellams et al. also found that, compared to individualist cultures, people from collectivist cultures, such as [[East Asian]] cultures, tended to judge their own group members less favorably than they judged outsiders, whereas people from individualist cultures were inclined to judge members of their own group more favorably than they judged outsiders.&lt;ref name=MaKellams/&gt; [[Social identity theory]]{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} and [[Freudian]] theorists explain in-group derogation as the result of a negative [[self-image]], which they believe is then extended to the group.&lt;ref name=MaKellams/&gt; Ma-Kellams et al. theorized that "ingroup derogation may be more culturally normative and less troubling for East Asians" as evidenced by the fact that East Asians were also likely to report high levels of positive affect (emotion) towards members of their in-group, demonstrating ambivalence towards the unfavorable characteristics they had acknowledged about their in-group. According to Ma-Kellam et al., culturally-ingrained attitudes and beliefs, rather than low self-esteem, may play a role in collectivist cultures' in-group derogation due to their ability to tolerate holding seemingly contradictory views.&lt;ref name=MaKellams&gt;{{Cite journal|title = I Am Against Us?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5335">'''Jensenism''' is a term coined by ''[[New York Times]]'' writer Lee Edson. Named after educational psychologist [[Arthur Jensen]], it was originally defined as "the theory that [[IQ]] is largely determined by the [[gene]]s". The term was coined after Jensen published the article [[How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?]] in the ''[[Harvard Educational Review]]'' in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/08/31/archives/jensenism-n-the-theory-that-iq-is-largely-determined-by-the-genes.html |title=jensenism, n.

Among the latter was a paper by behavior geneticist [[Jerry Hirsch]], who claimed that Jensenism was an "intellectual disgrace", while also criticizing some of Jensen's earlier critics: "Time and again the opposition to Jensenism has resorted to inarticulate and self-defeating hooliganism, so easily perceived as fascist interference with academic freedom and unfettered scientific inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hirsch |first=Jerry |author-link=Jerry Hirsch |date=January 1975 |title=Jensenism: The Bankruptcy of "Science" Without Scholarship |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1741-5446.1975.tb00663.x |journal=Educational Theory |language=en |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=3–27 |doi=10.1111/j.1741-5446.1975.tb00663.x |issn=0013-2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1970 article responding to Jensen, biologist [[Richard Lewontin]] argued that Jensenism was a more recent manifestation of the 17th-century [[Christian heresy]] [[Jansenism]], referring to the former as a "doctrine" that is "as erroneous in the twentieth century as it was in the seventeenth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lewontin |first=Richard C. |authorlink=Richard Lewontin|date=March 1970 |title=Race and Intelligence|journal=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] |language=en |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=2–8 |doi=10.1080/00963402.1970.11457774 |issn=0096-3402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] also criticized Jensenism, arguing that it rested "on a rotten edifice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/02/local/la-me-arthur-jensen-20121102 |title=Arthur Jensen dies at 89; his views on race and IQ created a furor |last=Woo |first=Elaine |date=2012-11-02 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2018-09-19 |language=en-US |issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen's ideas reportedly received a more favorable reception in the [[Nixon administration]]; Lewontin quoted then-United States ambassador to [[India]] [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] in 1974 as saying, "The winds of Jensenism are blowing through Washington with gale force."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1974/7/12/lewontin-tells-300-at-forum-race/ |title=Lewontin Tells 300 at Forum Race and I.Q.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8764">'''Kan extensions''' are [[Universal property|universal constructs]] in [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]]. They are closely related to [[Adjoint functors|adjoints]], but are also related to [[Limit (category theory)|limits]] and [[End (category theory)|ends]]. They are named after [[Daniel Kan|Daniel M. Kan]], who constructed certain (Kan) extensions using [[Limit (category theory)|limits]] in 1960.

An early use of (what is now known as) a Kan extension from 1956 was in [[homological algebra]] to compute [[derived functor]]s.

In ''[[Categories for the Working Mathematician]]'' [[Saunders Mac Lane]] titled a section "All Concepts Are Kan Extensions", and went on to write that

:The notion of Kan extensions subsumes all the other fundamental concepts of category theory.

Kan extensions generalize the notion of extending a function defined on a subset to a function defined on the whole set.  The definition, not surprisingly, is at a high level of abstraction. When specialised to [[poset]]s, it becomes a relatively familiar type of question on [[constrained optimization]].

==Definition==

A Kan extension proceeds from the data of three categories 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}, \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;

and two [[functor]]s

:&lt;math&gt;X \colon \mathbf{A} \to \mathbf{C}, F \colon \mathbf{A} \to \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;,

and comes in two varieties: the "left" Kan extension and the "right" Kan extension of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

It amounts to finding the dashed arrow and the 2-cell &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; in the following diagram:

:&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;[[File:Right Kan Extension.png|Right Kan Extension]]&lt;/div&gt;

(The natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; in the above depiction of the right Kan extension points to the functor &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; from the functor &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. However, it should be interpreted as an arrow to the functor &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; from the composed functor &lt;math&gt;RF \colon \mathbf{A} \to \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;.)

Formally, the ''right Kan extension of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;'' consists of a functor &lt;math&gt;R \colon \mathbf{B} \to \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; and a natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\eta \colon RF \to X&lt;/math&gt; which is couniversal with respect to the specification, in the sense that for any functor &lt;math&gt;M \colon \mathbf{B} \to \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; and natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\mu \colon MF \to X&lt;/math&gt;, a unique natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\delta \colon M \to R&lt;/math&gt; is defined and fits into a commutative diagram

:&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;[[Image:Right Kan extension universal property diagram.PNG]]&lt;/div&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\delta_F&lt;/math&gt; is the natural transformation with &lt;math&gt;\delta_F(a) = \delta(Fa) \colon MF(a) \to RF(a)&lt;/math&gt; for any object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;).

The functor ''R'' is often written &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ran}_FX&lt;/math&gt;.

As with the other [[Universal property|universal constructs]] in [[category theory]], the "left" version of the Kan extension is [[Dual (category theory)|dual]] to the "right" one and is obtained by replacing all categories by their [[opposite category|opposite]]s.  The effect of this on the description above is merely to reverse the direction of the natural transformations (recall that a [[natural transformation]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; between the functors &lt;math&gt;F,G \colon \mathbf{C} \to \mathbf{D}&lt;/math&gt; consists of the data of an arrow &lt;math&gt;T(a) \colon F(a) \to G(a)&lt;/math&gt; for every object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying a "naturality" property.  When we pass to the opposite categories, the source and target of &lt;math&gt;T(a)&lt;/math&gt; are swapped, causing &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; to act in the opposite direction).

This gives rise to the alternate description: the ''left Kan extension of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;'' consists of a functor &lt;math&gt;L \colon \mathbf{B} \to \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; and a natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \colon X \to L F&lt;/math&gt; which are universal with respect to this specification, in the sense that for any other functor &lt;math&gt;M \colon \mathbf{B} \to \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; and natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\alpha \colon X \to M F&lt;/math&gt;, a unique natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\sigma \colon L \to M&lt;/math&gt; exists and fits into a commutative diagram:

:&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;[[Image:Kan extension universal property diagram.png]]&lt;/div&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_F&lt;/math&gt; is the natural transformation with &lt;math&gt;\sigma_F(a) = \sigma(Fa) \colon LF(a) \to MF(a)&lt;/math&gt; for any object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;).

The functor ''L'' is often written &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Lan}_FX&lt;/math&gt;.

The use of the word "the" (as in "the left Kan extension") is justified by the fact that, as with all universal constructions, if the object defined exists, then it is unique up to unique isomorphism.  In this case, that means that (for left Kan extensions) if &lt;math&gt;L, M&lt;/math&gt; are two left Kan extensions of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon, \alpha&lt;/math&gt; are the corresponding transformations, then there exists a unique ''isomorphism'' of functors &lt;math&gt;\sigma \colon L \to M&lt;/math&gt; such that the second diagram above commutes.  Likewise for right Kan extensions.

==Properties==
===Kan extensions as [[limit (category theory)|(co)limits]]===
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;X:\mathbf{A}\to\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F:\mathbf{A}\to\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; are two functors. If '''A''' is small and '''C''' is cocomplete, then there exists a left Kan extension &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Lan}_FX&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, defined at each object ''b'' of '''B''' by

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{Lan}_F X)(b) = \varinjlim_{f:Fa \to b} X(a)&lt;/math&gt;

where the colimit is taken over the [[comma category]] &lt;math&gt;(F \downarrow b)&lt;/math&gt;.

Dually, if '''A''' is small and '''C''' is complete, then right Kan extensions along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; exist, and can be computed as limits.

===Kan extensions as [[coend (category theory)|(co)ends]]===
Suppose that

:&lt;math&gt;K:\mathbf{M}\to\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T:\mathbf{M}\to\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

are two functors such that for all objects ''m'' and ''m''' of '''M'''  and all objects ''c'' of '''C''', the [[copower (category theory)|copowers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}(Km',c)\cdot Tm&lt;/math&gt; exist in '''A'''. Then the functor ''T'' has a left Kan extension ''L'' along ''K'', which is such that, for every object ''c'' of '''C''',

:&lt;math&gt;Lc=(\mathrm{Lan}_KT)c=\int^m\mathbf{C}(Km,c)\cdot Tm&lt;/math&gt;

when the above [[coend (category theory)|coend]] exists for every object ''c'' of '''C'''.

Dually, right Kan extensions can be computed by the [[end (category theory)|end]] formula


:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{Ran}_KT)c=\int_mTm^{\mathbf{C}(c,Km)}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Limits as Kan extensions===
The [[Limit (category theory)|limit]] of a functor &lt;math&gt;F:C\to D&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a Kan extension by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lim}F=\mathrm{Ran}_E F&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the unique functor from &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; to [[Subdivided interval categories| &amp;#120793;]] (the category with one object and one arrow, a terminal object in &lt;math&gt;Cat&lt;/math&gt;). The colimit of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed similarly by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{colim}F=\mathrm{Lan}_E F&lt;/math&gt;.

===Adjoints as Kan extensions===
A functor &lt;math&gt;F : C \to D&lt;/math&gt; possesses a [[left adjoint]] if and only if the right Kan extension of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Id} : C \to C&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; exists and is preserved by &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, a left adjoint is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ran}_F \mathrm{Id}&lt;/math&gt; and this Kan extension is even preserved by any functor &lt;math&gt;C \to E&lt;/math&gt; whatsoever, i.e. is an ''absolute'' Kan extension.

Dually, a right adjoint exists if and only if the left Kan extension of the identity along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; exists and is preserved by &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Langrange portrait.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] (1736–1813)]]

'''Lagrangian mechanics''' is a reformulation of [[classical mechanics]], introduced by the Italian-French mathematician and astronomer [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] in 1788.

In Lagrangian mechanics, the trajectory of a system of particles is derived by solving the Lagrange equations in one of two forms, either the ''Lagrange equations of the first kind'',&lt;ref name="Dvorak 2005 page=24"&gt;{{harvnb|Dvorak|Freistetter|2005|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which treat [[constraint (classical mechanics)|constraints]] explicitly as extra equations, often using [[Lagrange multipliers]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haken|page=61|2006|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lanczos|page=43 |1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Lagrange equations of the second kind'', which incorporate the constraints directly by judicious choice of [[generalized coordinates]].&lt;ref name="Dvorak 2005 page=24"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Menzel |Zatzkis |1960|edition=2nd|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, a [[mathematical function]] called the '''Lagrangian''' is a function of the generalized coordinates, their time derivatives, and time, and contains the information about the dynamics of the system.

No new physics are necessarily introduced in applying Lagrangian mechanics compared to [[Newtonian mechanics]]. It is, however, more mathematically sophisticated and systematic. Newton's laws can include non-[[conservative force]]s like [[friction]]; however, they must include constraint forces explicitly and are best suited to [[Cartesian coordinates]]. Lagrangian mechanics is ideal for systems with conservative forces and for bypassing constraint forces in any [[coordinate system]]. Dissipative and driven forces can be accounted for by splitting the external forces into a sum of potential and non-potential forces, leading to a set of modified [[Euler–Lagrange equation|Euler–Lagrange (EL) equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jose|Saletan|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generalized coordinates can be chosen by convenience, to exploit symmetries in the system or the geometry of the constraints, which may simplify solving for the motion of the system. Lagrangian mechanics also reveals conserved quantities and their symmetries in a direct way, as a special case of [[Noether's theorem]].

Lagrangian mechanics is important not just for its broad applications, but also for its role in advancing deep understanding of [[physics]]. Although Lagrange only sought to describe [[classical mechanics]] in his treatise ''[[Mécanique analytique]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lagrange|1811}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lagrange|1815}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Rowan Hamilton]] later developed ''[[Hamilton's principle]]'' that can be used to derive the Lagrange equation and was later recognized to be applicable to much of fundamental [[theoretical physics]] as well, particularly [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[theory of relativity]]. It can also be applied to other systems ''by analogy'', for instance to coupled [[electric circuit]]s with [[inductance]]s and [[capacitance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldtein|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lagrangian mechanics is widely used to solve mechanical problems in physics and when [[Newtonian mechanics|Newton's formulation]] of classical mechanics is not convenient. Lagrangian mechanics applies to the dynamics of particles, while [[field (physics)|field]]s are described using a [[Lagrangian density]]. Lagrange's equations are also used in optimisation problems of dynamic systems. In mechanics, Lagrange's equations of the second kind are used much more than those of the first kind.

==Introduction==

[[File:Bead on wire constraint.svg|thumb|200px|Bead constrained to move on a frictionless wire. The wire exerts a reaction force '''C''' on the bead to keep it on the wire. The non-constraint force '''N''' in this case is gravity. Notice the initial position of the wire can lead to different motions.]]
[[File:Pendulum constraint.svg|150px|thumb|Simple pendulum. Since the rod is rigid, the position of the bob is constrained according to the equation ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = 0, the constraint force '''C''' is the tension in the rod. Again the non-constraint force '''N''' in this case is gravity.]]

Suppose we have a bead sliding around on a wire, or a swinging [[simple pendulum]], etc. If one tracks each of the massive objects (bead, pendulum bob, etc.) as a particle, calculation of the motion of the particle using [[Newtonian mechanics]] would require solving for the time-varying constraint force required to keep the particle in the constrained motion (reaction force exerted by the wire on the bead, or [[Tension (physics)|tension]] in the pendulum rod). For the same problem using Lagrangian mechanics, one looks at the path the particle can take and chooses a convenient set of ''independent'' [[generalized coordinate]]s that completely characterize the possible motion of the particle. This choice eliminates the need for the constraint force to enter into the resultant system of equations. There are fewer equations since one is not directly calculating the influence of the constraint on the particle at a given moment.

For a wide variety of physical systems, if the size and shape of a massive object are negligible, it is a useful simplification to treat it as a [[point particle]]. For a system of ''N'' point particles with [[mass]]es ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''m&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'', each particle has a [[position vector]], denoted '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Cartesian coordinates]] are often sufficient, so '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and so on. In [[three dimensional space]], each position vector requires three [[coordinate vector|coordinates]] to uniquely define the location of a point, so there are 3''N'' coordinates to uniquely define the configuration of the system. These are all specific points in space to locate the particles, a general point in space is written '''r''' = (''x'', ''y'', ''z''). The [[velocity]] of each particle is how fast the particle moves along its path of motion, and is the [[time derivative]] of its position, thus&lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathbf{v}_1 = \frac{d\mathbf{r}_1}{dt}, \mathbf{v}_2 = \frac{d\mathbf{r}_2}{dt},\ldots,
\mathbf{v}_N = \frac{d\mathbf{r}_N}{dt}  &lt;/math&gt;In Newtonian mechanics, the [[equations of motion]] are given by [[Newton's laws]]. The second law "net [[force]] equals mass times [[acceleration]]",&lt;math display="block"&gt;\sum \mathbf{F} = m\frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;applies to each particle. For an ''N'' particle system in 3 dimensions, there are 3''N'' second order [[ordinary differential equation]]s in the positions of the particles to solve for.

Instead of forces, Lagrangian mechanics uses the [[energy|energies]] in the system. The central quantity of Lagrangian mechanics is the '''Lagrangian''', a function which summarizes the dynamics of the entire system. Overall, the Lagrangian has units of energy, but no single expression for all physical systems. Any function which generates the correct equations of motion, in agreement with physical laws, can be taken as a Lagrangian. It is nevertheless possible to construct general expressions for large classes of applications. The ''non-relativistic'' Lagrangian for a system of particles can be defined by&lt;ref&gt;Torby1984, p.270&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L = T - V  &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac {1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^N m_k v^2_k &lt;/math&gt;

is the total [[kinetic energy]] of the system, equalling the [[summation|sum]] Σ of the kinetic energies of the particles,&lt;ref name="Torby 1984 page=269"&gt;{{harvnb|Torby|1984|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''V'' is the [[potential energy]] of the system.

Kinetic energy is the energy of the system's motion, and ''v&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; · '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the magnitude squared of velocity, equivalent to the [[dot product]] of the velocity with itself. The kinetic energy is a function only of the velocities '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, not the positions '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; nor time ''t'', so ''T'' = ''T''('''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...).

The [[potential energy]] of the system reflects the energy of interaction between the particles, i.e. how much energy any one particle will have due to all the others and other external influences. For [[conservative force]]s (e.g. [[Newtonian gravity]]), it is a function of the position vectors of the particles only, so ''V'' = ''V''('''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...). For those non-conservative forces which can be derived from an appropriate potential (e.g. [[electromagnetic potential]]), the velocities will appear also, ''V'' = ''V''('''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...). If there is some external field or external driving force changing with time, the potential will change with time, so most generally ''V'' = ''V''('''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''t'').

The above form of ''L'' does not hold in [[relativistic Lagrangian mechanics]], and must be replaced by a function consistent with special or general relativity. Also, for dissipative forces another function must be introduced alongside ''L''.

One or more of the particles may each be subject to one or more [[holonomic constraint]]s, such a constraint is described by an equation of the form ''f''('''r''', ''t'') = 0. If the number of constraints in the system is ''C'', then each constraint has an equation, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''r''', ''t'') = 0, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''r''', ''t'') = 0, ... ''f&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''('''r''', ''t'') = 0, each could apply to any of the particles. If particle ''k'' is subject to constraint ''i'', then ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''('''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t'') = 0. At any instant of time, the coordinates of a constrained particle are linked together and not independent. The constraint equations determine the allowed paths the particles can move along, but not where they are or how fast they go at every instant of time. [[Nonholonomic constraints]] depend on the particle velocities, accelerations, or higher derivatives of position. Lagrangian mechanics ''can only be applied to systems whose constraints, if any, are all holonomic''. Three examples of nonholonomic constraints are:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=36–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the constraint equations are nonintegrable, when the constraints have inequalities, or with complicated non-conservative forces like friction. Nonholonomic constraints require special treatment, and one may have to revert to Newtonian mechanics, or use other methods.

If ''T'' or ''V'' or both depend explicitly on time due to time-varying constraints or external influences, the Lagrangian ''L''('''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''t'') is ''explicitly time-dependent''. If neither the potential nor the kinetic energy depend on time, then the Lagrangian ''L''('''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...) is ''explicitly independent of time''. In either case, the Lagrangian will always have implicit time-dependence through the generalized coordinates.

With these definitions '''Lagrange's equations of the first kind''' are&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where ''k'' = 1, 2, ..., ''N'' labels the particles, there is a [[Lagrange multiplier]] ''λ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each constraint equation ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{r}_k} \equiv \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_k},\frac{\partial}{\partial y_k},\frac{\partial}{\partial z_k}\right)\,,\quad \frac{\partial}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{r}}_k} \equiv \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \dot{x}_k},\frac{\partial}{\partial \dot{y}_k},\frac{\partial}{\partial \dot{z}_k}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

are each shorthands for a vector of [[partial derivative]]s {{math|∂/∂}} with respect to the indicated variables (not a derivative with respect to the entire vector).&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Sometimes in this context the [[variational derivative]] denoted and defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta}{\delta \mathbf{r}_k} \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{r}_k} - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{r}}_k} &lt;/math&gt;

is used. Throughout this article only partial and total derivatives are used.&lt;/ref&gt; Each overdot is a shorthand for a [[time derivative]]. This procedure does increase the number of equations to solve compared to Newton's laws, from 3''N'' to 3''N'' + ''C'', because there are 3''N'' coupled second order differential equations in the position coordinates and multipliers, plus ''C'' constraint equations. However, when solved alongside the position coordinates of the particles, the multipliers can yield information about the constraint forces. The coordinates do not need to be eliminated by solving the constraint equations.

In the Lagrangian, the position coordinates and velocity components are all [[Dependent and independent variables#Mathematics|independent variable]]s, and derivatives of the Lagrangian are taken with respect to these separately according to the usual [[differentiation rules]] (e.g. the derivative of ''L'' with respect to the ''z''-velocity component of particle 2, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''z''2&lt;/sub&gt; = d''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/d''t'', is just that; no awkward [[chain rule]]s or total derivatives need to be used to relate the velocity component to the corresponding coordinate ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

In each constraint equation, one coordinate is redundant because it is determined from the other two. The number of ''independent'' coordinates is therefore ''n'' = 3''N'' − ''C''. We can transform each position vector to a common set of ''n'' [[generalized coordinates]], conveniently written as an ''n''-tuple '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), by expressing each position vector, and hence the position coordinates, as [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of the generalized coordinates and time,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_k = \mathbf{r}_k(\mathbf{q}, t) = (x_k(\mathbf{q}, t), y_k(\mathbf{q}, t), z_k(\mathbf{q}, t), t)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The vector '''q''' is a point in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of the system. The time derivatives of the generalized coordinates are called the generalized velocities, and for each particle the transformation of its velocity vector, the [[total derivative]] of its position with respect to time, is

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_j = \frac{\mathrm{d}q_j}{\mathrm{d}t} \,, \quad \mathbf{v}_k = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_k}{\partial q_j}\dot{q}_j +\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_k}{\partial t}\,. &lt;/math&gt;

Given this '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, the kinetic energy ''in generalized coordinates'' depends on the generalized velocities, generalized coordinates, and time if the position vectors depend explicitly on time due to time-varying constraints, so ''T'' = ''T''('''q''', d'''q'''/d''t'', ''t'').

With these definitions we have the '''[[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s''', or '''Lagrange's equations of the second kind'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Penrose|2007|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

are mathematical results from the [[calculus of variations]], which can also be used in mechanics. Substituting in the Lagrangian ''L''('''q''', d'''q'''/d''t'', ''t''), gives the [[equations of motion]] of the system. The number of equations has decreased compared to Newtonian mechanics, from 3''N'' to ''n'' = 3''N'' − ''C'' coupled second order differential equations in the generalized coordinates. These equations do not include constraint forces at all, only non-constraint forces need to be accounted for.

Although the equations of motion include [[partial derivative]]s, the results of the partial derivatives are still [[ordinary differential equation]]s in the position coordinates of the particles. The [[total derivative|total time derivative]] denoted d/d''t'' often involves [[implicit differentiation]]. Both equations are linear in the Lagrangian, but will generally be nonlinear coupled equations in the coordinates.

==From Newtonian to Lagrangian mechanics==

===Newton's laws===
[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Isaac Newton]] (1642—1727)]]

For simplicity, Newton's laws can be illustrated for one particle without much loss of generality (for a system of ''N'' particles, all of these equations apply to each particle in the system). The [[equation of motion]] for particle of mass ''m'' is [[Newton's second law]] of 1687, in modern vector notation

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where '''a''' is its acceleration and '''F''' the resultant force acting ''on'' it. In three spatial dimensions, this is a system of three coupled second order [[ordinary differential equation]]s to solve, since there are three components in this vector equation. The solutions are the position vectors '''r''' of the particles at time ''t'', subject to the [[initial condition]]s of '''r''' and '''v''' when ''t'' = 0.

Newton's laws are easy to use in Cartesian coordinates, but Cartesian coordinates are not always convenient, and for other coordinate systems the equations of motion can become complicated. In a set of [[curvilinear coordinates]] '''ξ''' = (''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the law in [[tensor index notation]] is the ''"Lagrangian form"''&lt;ref name="Schuam 1988"&gt;{{harvnb|Schuam|page=156|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Synge 1949"&gt;{{harvnb|Synge|Schild|page=150–152|1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; F^a = m \left( \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \xi^a}{\mathrm{d}t^2} + \Gamma^a {}_{bc} \frac{\mathrm{d}\xi^b}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\mathrm{d}\xi^c}{\mathrm{d}t} \right) = g^{ak} \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{\xi}^k} - \frac{\partial T}{\partial \xi^k}\right) \,, \quad \dot{\xi}^a \equiv \frac{\mathrm{d} \xi^a }{\mathrm{d}t} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''F&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the ''a''th [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant component]]s of the resultant force acting on the particle, Γ''&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;bc&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the [[Christoffel symbols]] of the second kind,

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{1}{2} m g_{bc} \frac{\mathrm{d} \xi^b}{\mathrm{d}t} \frac{\mathrm{d} \xi^c}{\mathrm{d}t} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

is the kinetic energy of the particle, and ''g&lt;sub&gt;bc&lt;/sub&gt;'' the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant components]] of the ''[[metric tensor]]'' of the curvilinear coordinate system. All the indices ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', each take the values 1, 2, 3. Curvilinear coordinates are not the same as generalized coordinates.

It may seem like an overcomplication to cast Newton's law in this form, but there are advantages. The acceleration components in terms of the Christoffel symbols can be avoided by evaluating derivatives of the kinetic energy instead. If there is no resultant force acting on the particle, '''F''' = '''0''', it does not accelerate, but moves with constant velocity in a straight line. Mathematically, the solutions of the differential equation are ''[[geodesic]]s'', the curves of extremal length between two points in space (These may end up being minimal so the shortest paths, but that is not necessary). In flat 3d real space the geodesics are simply straight lines. So for a free particle, Newton's second law coincides with the geodesic equation, and states free particles follow geodesics, the extremal trajectories it can move along. If the particle is subject to forces, '''F''' ≠ '''0''', the particle accelerates due to forces acting on it, and deviates away from the geodesics it would follow if free. With appropriate extensions of the quantities given here in flat 3d space to 4d [[curved spacetime]], the above form of Newton's law also carries over to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]], in which case free particles follow geodesics in curved spacetime that are no longer "straight lines" in the ordinary sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foster|Nightingale|1995|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, we still need to know the total resultant force '''F''' acting on the particle, which in turn requires the resultant non-constraint force '''N''' plus the resultant constraint force '''C''',

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{C} + \mathbf{N} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The constraint forces can be complicated, since they will generally depend on time. Also, if there are constraints, the curvilinear coordinates are not independent but related by one or more constraint equations.

The constraint forces can either be eliminated from the equations of motion so only the non-constraint forces remain, or included by including the constraint equations in the equations of motion.

A fundamental result in [[analytical mechanics]] is [[D'Alembert's principle]], introduced in 1708 by [[Jacques Bernoulli]] to understand [[static equilibrium]], and developed by [[D'Alembert]] in 1743 to solve dynamical problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle asserts for ''N'' particles the virtual work, i.e. the work along a virtual displacement, δ'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, is zero&lt;ref name="Torby 1984 page=269"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^N ( \mathbf {N}_k + \mathbf {C}_k - m_k \mathbf{a}_k )\cdot \delta \mathbf{r}_k = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The ''[[virtual displacement]]s'', δ'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, are by definition infinitesimal changes in the configuration of the system consistent with the constraint forces acting on the system ''at an instant of time'',&lt;ref name="Goldstein 1980 page=16–18"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. in such a way that the constraint forces maintain the constrained motion. They are not the same as the actual displacements in the system, which are caused by the resultant constraint and non-constraint forces acting on the particle to accelerate and move it.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Here the virtual displacements are assumed reversible, it is possible for some systems to have non-reversible virtual displacements that violate this principle, see [[Udwadia–Kalaba equation]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virtual work]] is the work done along a virtual displacement for any force (constraint or non-constraint).

Since the constraint forces act perpendicular to the motion of each particle in the system to maintain the constraints, the total virtual work by the constraint forces acting on the system is zero;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|2008|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;In other words

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}_k\cdot\delta\mathbf{r}_k = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for particle ''k'' subject to a constraint force, however

:&lt;math&gt;C_{k\,x} \delta x_k \neq 0\,,\quad C_{k\,y} \delta y_k \neq 0\,,\quad C_{k\,z} \delta z_k \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;

because of the constraint equations on the '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; coordinates.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^N \mathbf {C}_k \cdot \delta \mathbf{r}_k = 0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^N (\mathbf {N}_k - m_k \mathbf{a}_k ) \cdot \delta \mathbf{r}_k = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus D'Alembert's principle allows us to concentrate on only the applied non-constraint forces, and exclude the constraint forces in the equations of motion.&lt;ref name="Hand 2008 page=15"&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fetter |Walecka|1980|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form shown is also independent of the choice of coordinates. However, it cannot be readily used to set up the equations of motion in an arbitrary coordinate system since the displacements δ'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; might be connected by a constraint equation, which prevents us from setting the ''N'' individual summands to 0. We will therefore seek a system of mutually independent coordinates for which the total sum will be 0 if and only if the individual summands are 0. Setting each of the summands to 0 will eventually give us our separated equations of motion.

===Equations of motion from D'Alembert's principle===
If there are constraints on particle ''k'', then since the coordinates of the position '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = (''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''z&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'') are linked together by a constraint equation, so are those of the [[virtual displacement]]s ''δ'''''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = (''δx&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''δy&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''δz&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''). Since the generalized coordinates are independent, we can avoid the complications with the ''δ'''''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; by converting to virtual displacements in the generalized coordinates. These are related in the same form as a [[total differential]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Torby|1984|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf{r}_k = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac {\partial \mathbf{r}_k} {\partial q_j} \delta q_j \,.&lt;/math&gt;

There is no partial time derivative with respect to time multiplied by a time increment, since this is a virtual displacement, one along the constraints in an ''instant'' of time.

The first term in D'Alembert's principle above is the virtual work done by the non-constraint forces '''N'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; along the virtual displacements ''δ'''''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, and can without loss of generality be converted into the generalized analogues by the definition of [[generalized force]]s

:&lt;math&gt;Q_j = \sum_{k=1}^N \mathbf {N}_k \cdot \frac {\partial \mathbf{r}_k} {\partial q_j} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^N \mathbf{N}_k \cdot \delta \mathbf{r}_k = \sum_{k=1}^N  \mathbf {N}_k \cdot \sum_{j=1}^n \frac {\partial \mathbf{r}_k} {\partial q_j} \delta q_j = \sum_{j=1}^n Q_j \delta q_j \,.&lt;/math&gt;
 
This is half of the conversion to generalized coordinates. It remains to convert the acceleration term into generalized coordinates, which is not immediately obvious. Recalling the Lagrange form of Newton's second law, the partial derivatives of the kinetic energy with respect to the generalized coordinates and velocities can be found to give the desired result;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Torby|1984|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^N m_k \mathbf{a}_k \cdot \frac {\partial \mathbf{r}_k}{\partial q_j} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}_j} - \frac{\partial T}{\partial q_j} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Now D'Alembert's principle is in the generalized coordinates as required,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^n \left[ Q_j - \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}_j} - \frac{\partial T}{\partial q_j} \right) \right] \delta q_j = 0 \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and since these virtual displacements ''δq&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are independent and nonzero, the coefficients can be equated to zero, resulting in '''Lagrange's equations'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kibble |Berkshire|edition=5th|2004|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fetter |Walecka|1980|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''generalized equations of motion''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q_j = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}_j} - \frac{\partial T}{\partial q_j} &lt;/math&gt;

These equations are equivalent to Newton's laws ''for the non-constraint forces''. The generalized forces in this equation are derived from the non-constraint forces only – the constraint forces have been excluded from D'Alembert's principle and do not need to be found. The generalized forces may be non-conservative, provided they satisfy D'Alembert's principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euler–Lagrange equations and Hamilton's principle===
[[File:Least action principle.svg|250px|thumb|As the system evolves, '''q''' traces a path through [[configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] (only some are shown). The path taken by the system (red) has a stationary action (δ''S'' = 0) under small changes in the configuration of the system (δ'''q''').&lt;ref name=penrose&gt;{{cite book |author=R. Penrose| title=[[The Road to Reality]]| publisher= Vintage books| year=2007 | page = 474|isbn=0-679-77631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

For a non-conservative force which depends on velocity, it ''may'' be possible to find a potential energy function ''V'' that depends on positions and velocities. If the generalized forces ''Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be derived from a potential ''V'' such that&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstien|1980|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kibble|Berkshire|edition=5th|2004|page=234–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q_j = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial V}{\partial \dot{q}_j} - \frac{\partial V}{\partial q_j} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

equating to Lagrange's equations and defining the Lagrangian as ''L'' = ''T'' − ''V'' obtains '''Lagrange's equations of the second kind''' or the '''Euler–Lagrange equations''' of motion

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_j} - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_j}  = 0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

However, the Euler–Lagrange equations can only account for non-conservative forces ''if'' a potential can be found as shown. This may not always be possible for non-conservative forces, and Lagrange's equations do not involve any potential, only generalized forces; therefore they are more general than the Euler–Lagrange equations.

The Euler–Lagrange equations also follow from the [[calculus of variations]]. The ''variation'' of the Lagrangian is

:&lt;math&gt;\delta L = \sum_{j=1}^n \left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_j} \delta q_j + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_j} \delta \dot{q}_j \right) \,,\quad \delta \dot{q}_j \equiv \delta\frac{\mathrm{d}q_j}{\mathrm{d}t} \equiv \frac{\mathrm{d}(\delta q_j)}{\mathrm{d}t} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

which has a similar form to the [[total differential]] of ''L'', but the virtual displacements and their time derivatives replace differentials, and there is no time increment in accordance with the definition of the virtual displacements. An [[integration by parts]] with respect to time can transfer the time derivative of ''δq&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the ∂''L''/∂(d''q&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/d''t''), in the process exchanging d(''δq&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'')/d''t'' for ''δq&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', allowing the independent virtual displacements to be factorized from the derivatives of the Lagrangian,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \delta L \, \mathrm{d}t = \sum_{j=1}^n\left[\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_j}\delta q_j\right]_{t_1}^{t_2} + \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \sum_{j=1}^n \left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_j} - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_j} \right)\delta q_j \, \mathrm{d}t  \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Now, if the condition ''δq&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''δq&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0 holds for all ''j'', the terms not integrated are zero. If in addition the entire time integral of ''δL'' is zero, then because the ''δq&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are independent, and the only way for a definite integral to be zero is if the integrand equals zero, each of the coefficients of ''δq&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' must also be zero. Then we obtain the equations of motion. This can be summarized by '''[[Hamilton's principle]]''';

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\delta L \, \mathrm{d}t = 0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The time integral of the Lagrangian is another quantity called the [[action (physics)|action]], defined as&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L\,\mathrm{d}t\,,&lt;/math&gt;

which is a ''[[Functional (mathematics)|functional]]''; it takes in the Lagrangian function for all times between ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and returns a scalar value. Its dimensions are the same as [ [[angular momentum]] ], [energy]·[time], or [length]·[momentum]. With this definition Hamilton's principle is

:&lt;math&gt;\delta S = 0\,. &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, instead of thinking about particles accelerating in response to applied forces, one might think of them picking out the path with a stationary action, with the end points of the path in configuration space held fixed at the initial and final times. Hamilton's principle is sometimes referred to as the ''[[principle of least action]]'', however the action functional need only be ''stationary'', not necessarily a maximum or a minimum value. Any variation of the functional gives an increase in the functional integral of the action.

Historically, the idea of finding the shortest path a particle can follow subject to a force motivated the first applications of the [[calculus of variations]] to mechanical problems, such as the [[Brachistochrone problem]] solved by [[Jean Bernoulli]] in 1696, as well as [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Daniel Bernoulli]], [[Guillaume de l'Hôpital|L'Hôpital]] around the same time, and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] the following year.&lt;ref name="Hand 2008 page=44–45"&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton himself was thinking along the lines of the variational calculus, but did not publish.&lt;ref name="Hand 2008 page=44–45"/&gt; These ideas in turn lead to the [[variational principle]]s of mechanics, of [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]], [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]], [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]], and others.

Hamilton's principle can be applied to [[nonholonomic constraints]] if the constraint equations can be put into a certain form, a [[linear combination]] of first order differentials in the coordinates. The resulting constraint equation can be rearranged into first order differential equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will not be given here.

===Lagrange multipliers and constraints===

The Lagrangian ''L'' can be varied in the Cartesian '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; coordinates, for ''N'' particles,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \sum_{k=1}^N \left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{r}_k} - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{r}}_k} \right)\cdot\delta \mathbf{r}_k \, \mathrm{d}t = 0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Hamilton's principle is still valid even if the coordinates ''L'' is expressed in are not independent, here '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, but the constraints are still assumed to be holonomic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fetter|Walecka|pp=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; As always the end points are fixed ''δ'''''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''δ'''''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''0''' for all ''k''. What cannot be done is to simply equate the coefficients of δ'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; to zero because the δ'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are not independent. Instead, the method of [[Lagrange multiplier]]s can be used to include the constraints. Multiplying each constraint equation ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''('''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t'') = 0 by a Lagrange multiplier ''λ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for ''i'' = 1, 2, ..., ''C'', and adding the results to the original Lagrangian, gives the new Lagrangian

:&lt;math&gt;L' = L(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2,\ldots,\dot{\mathbf{r}}_1,\dot{\mathbf{r}}_2,\ldots,t) + \sum_{i=1}^C \lambda_i(t) f_i(\mathbf{r}_k,t) \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrange multipliers are arbitrary functions of time ''t'', but not functions of the coordinates '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, so the multipliers are on equal footing with the position coordinates. Varying this new Lagrangian and integrating with respect to time gives

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \delta L' \mathrm{d}t = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \sum_{k=1}^N \left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{r}_k} - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{r}}_k} + \sum_{i=1}^C \lambda_i \frac{\partial f_i }{\partial \mathbf{r}_k}\right)\cdot\delta \mathbf{r}_k \, \mathrm{d}t = 0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The introduced multipliers can be found so that the coefficients of ''δ'''''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are zero, even though the '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are not independent. The equations of motion follow. From the preceding analysis, obtaining the solution to this integral is equivalent to the statement

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L'}{\partial \mathbf{r}_k} - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L'}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{r}}_k} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{r}_k} - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{r}}_k} + \sum_{i=1}^C \lambda_i \frac{\partial f_i }{\partial \mathbf{r}_k} = 0 \,, &lt;/math&gt;

which are '''Lagrange's equations of the first kind'''. Also, the ''λ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' Euler-Lagrange equations for the new Lagrangian return the constraint equations

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L'}{\partial \lambda_i} - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L'}{\partial \dot{\lambda}_i}  = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad f_i(\mathbf{r}_k,t) = 0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

For the case of a conservative force given by the gradient of some potential energy ''V'', a function of the '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; coordinates only, substituting the Lagrangian ''L'' = ''T'' − ''V'' gives

:&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{ \frac{\partial T}{\partial \mathbf{r}_k} - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{r}}_k} }_{-\mathbf{F}_k} + \underbrace{ - \frac{\partial V}{\partial \mathbf{r}_k}}_{\mathbf{N}_k} + \sum_{i=1}^C \lambda_i \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial \mathbf{r}_k} = 0 \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and identifying the derivatives of kinetic energy as the (negative of the) resultant force, and the derivatives of the potential equaling the non-constraint force, it follows the constraint forces are

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}_k = \sum_{i=1}^C \lambda_i \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial \mathbf{r}_k}  \,, &lt;/math&gt;

thus giving the constraint forces explicitly in terms of the constraint equations and the Lagrange multipliers.

==Properties of the Euler–Lagrange equation==

In some cases, the Lagrangian has properties which can provide information about the system without solving the equations of motion. These follow from Lagrange's equations of the second kind.

===Non-uniqueness===

The Lagrangian of a given system is not unique. A Lagrangian ''L'' can be multiplied by a nonzero constant ''a'', an arbitrary constant ''b'' can be added, and the new Lagrangian ''aL'' + ''b'' will describe exactly the same motion as ''L''. A less obvious result is that two Lagrangians describing the same system can differ by the [[total derivative]] (not [[partial derivative|partial]]) of some function ''f''('''q''', ''t'') with respect to time;&lt;ref name="Landau 1976 page=4"&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|edition=3rd|1976|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L' = L + \frac{\mathrm{d}f(\mathbf{q},t)}{\mathrm{d}t}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Each Lagrangian will obtain exactly the same equations of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstien|Poole|Safko|2002|edition=3rd|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invariance under point transformations===

Given a set of generalized coordinates '''q''', if we change these variables to a new set of generalized coordinates '''s''' according to a [[Canonical transformation|point transformation]] '''q''' = '''q'''('''s''', ''t''), the new Lagrangian ''L''&amp;prime; is a function of the new coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;L(\mathbf{q}(\mathbf{s},t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}(\mathbf{s},\dot{\mathbf{s}},t), t ) = L'(\mathbf{s}, \dot{\mathbf{s}},t) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and by the [[chain rule#Higher dimensions|chain rule]] for partial differentiation, Lagrange's equations are invariant under this transformation;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L'}{\partial \dot{s}_i} = \frac{\partial L'}{\partial s_i} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This may simplify the equations of motion.

===Cyclic coordinates and conserved momenta===

An important property of the Lagrangian is that [[Conservation law|conserved quantities]] can easily be read off from it. The ''generalized momentum'' "canonically conjugate to" the coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;p_i =\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot q_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the Lagrangian ''L'' does ''not'' depend on some coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', it follows immediately from the Euler–Lagrange equations that

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{p}_i = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot q_i} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}=0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

and integrating shows the corresponding generalized momentum equals a constant, a conserved quantity. This is a special case of [[Noether's theorem]]. Such coordinates are called "cyclic" or "ignorable".

For example, a system may have a Lagrangian

:&lt;math&gt;L(r,\theta,\dot{s},\dot{z},\dot{r},\dot{\theta},\dot{\phi},t)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' and ''z'' are lengths along straight lines, ''s'' is an arc length along some curve, and ''θ'' and ''φ'' are angles. Notice ''z'', ''s'', and ''φ'' are all absent in the Lagrangian even though their velocities are not. Then the momenta

:&lt;math&gt;p_z =\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot z}\,,\quad p_s =\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot s}\,,\quad p_\phi =\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot \phi}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

are all conserved quantities. The units and nature of each generalized momentum will depend on the corresponding coordinate; in this case ''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a translational momentum in the ''z'' direction, ''p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is also a translational momentum along the curve ''s'' is measured, and ''p&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an angular momentum in the plane the angle ''φ'' is measured in. However complicated the motion of the system is, all the coordinates and velocities will vary in such a way that these momenta are conserved.

===Energy conservation===

Taking the [[total derivative]] of the Lagrangian ''L'' = ''T'' − ''V'' with respect to time leads to the general result

:&lt;math&gt; - \frac{\partial L}{\partial t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \dot{q}_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} - L\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;
 
If the entire Lagrangian is explicitly independent of time, it follows the partial time derivative of the Lagrangian is zero, {{math|∂''L''/∂''t'' {{=}} 0}}, so the quantity under the total time derivative in brackets

:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_{i=1}^n \dot{q}_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} - L &lt;/math&gt;

must be a constant for all times during the motion of the system, and it also follows the kinetic energy is a [[homogenous function]] of degree 2 in the generalized velocities. If in addition the potential ''V'' is only a function of coordinates and independent of velocities, it follows by direct calculation, or use of [[Homogeneous function#Positive homogeneity|Euler's theorem for homogenous functions]], that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \dot{q}_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} = \sum_{i=1}^n \dot{q}_i\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}_i}  = 2T \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Under all these circumstances,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the constant

:&lt;math&gt;E = T + V &lt;/math&gt;

is the ''total [[Conservation of energy|conserved energy]]'' of the system. The kinetic and potential energies still change as the system evolves, but the motion of the system will be such that their sum, the total energy, is constant. This is a valuable simplification, since the energy ''E'' is a constant of integration that counts as an arbitrary constant for the problem, and it may be possible to integrate the velocities from this energy relation to solve for the coordinates. In the case the velocity or kinetic energy or both depends on time, then the energy is ''not'' conserved.

If the potential energy is a [[homogeneous function]] of the coordinates and independent of time,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all position vectors are scaled by the same nonzero constant ''α'', '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime; = ''α'''''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, so that

:&lt;math&gt;V(\alpha\mathbf{r}_1,\alpha\mathbf{r}_2,\ldots, \alpha\mathbf{r}_N)=\alpha^N V(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2,\ldots, \mathbf{r}_N)&lt;/math&gt;

and time is scaled by a factor ''β'', ''t''&amp;prime; = ''βt'', then the velocities '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are scaled by a factor of ''α''/''β'' and the kinetic energy ''T'' by (''α''/''β'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The entire Lagrangian has been scaled by the same factor if

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha^2}{\beta^2}=\alpha^N \quad\Rightarrow\quad \beta = \alpha^{1-N/2}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the lengths and times have been scaled, the trajectories of the particles in the system follow geometrically similar paths differing in size. The length ''l'' traversed in time ''t'' in the original trajectory corresponds to a new length ''l&amp;prime;'' traversed in time ''t&amp;prime;'' in the new trajectory, given by the ratios

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{t'}{t}= \left(\frac{l'}{l}\right)^{1-N/2}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Interacting particles===

For a given system, if two subsystems ''A'' and ''B'' are non-interacting, the Lagrangian ''L'' of the overall system is the sum of the Lagrangians ''L&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''L&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' for the subsystems:&lt;ref name="Landau 1976 page=4"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L = L_A + L_B \,. &lt;/math&gt;

If they do interact this is not possible. In some situations, it may be possible to separate the Lagrangian of the system ''L'' into the sum of non-interacting Lagrangians, plus another Lagrangian ''L&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;'' containing information about the interaction,

:&lt;math&gt;L = L_A + L_B + L_{AB}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This may be physically motivated by taking the non-interacting Lagrangians to be kinetic energies only, while the interaction Lagrangian is the system's total potential energy. Also, in the limiting case of negligible interaction, ''L&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;'' tends to zero reducing to the non-interacting case above.

The extension to more than two non-interacting subsystems is straightforward – the overall Lagrangian is the sum of the separate Lagrangians for each subsystem. If there are interactions, then interaction Lagrangians may be added.

==Examples==

The following examples apply Lagrange's equations of the second kind to mechanical problems.

===Conservative force===

A particle of mass ''m'' moves under the influence of a [[conservative force]] derived from the [[gradient]] ∇ of a [[scalar potential]],

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = -\nabla V(\mathbf{r})\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If there are more particles, in accordance with the above results, the total kinetic energy is a sum over all the particle kinetic energies, and the potential is a function of all the coordinates.

====Cartesian coordinates====

The Lagrangian of the particle can be written

:&lt;math&gt;L(x,y,z, \dot{x}, \dot{y},\dot{z}) = \frac{1}{2} m (\dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 + \dot{z}^2) - V(x,y,z)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The equations of motion for the particle are found by applying the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]], for the ''x'' coordinate

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}} \right) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial x} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

with derivatives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = - \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}\,,\quad \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}}  = m \dot{x}\,,\quad \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}} \right) = m \ddot{x}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

hence

:&lt;math&gt;m \ddot{x} = - \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for the ''y'' and ''z'' coordinates. Collecting the equations in vector form we find

:&lt;math&gt;m\ddot{\mathbf{r}}=-\nabla V&lt;/math&gt;

which is [[Newton's second law of motion]] for a particle subject to a conservative force.

====Polar coordinates in 2d and 3d====

The Lagrangian for the above problem in spherical coordinates, with a central potential, is

:&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{m}{2}(\dot{r}^2+r^2\dot{\theta}^2 +r^2\sin^2\theta \, \dot{\varphi}^2)-V(r)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

so the Euler–Lagrange equations are

:&lt;math&gt;m\ddot{r}-mr(\dot{\theta}^2+\sin^2\theta \, \dot{\varphi}^2)+\frac{\partial V}{\partial r} =0\,,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(mr^2\dot{\theta}) -mr^2\sin\theta\cos\theta \, \dot{\varphi}^2=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(mr^2\sin^2\theta \, \dot{\varphi})=0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The ''φ'' coordinate is cyclic since it does not appear in the Lagrangian, so the conserved momentum in the system is the angular momentum

:&lt;math&gt;p_\varphi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\varphi}} = mr^2\sin^2\theta \dot{\varphi}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in which ''r'', ''θ'' and ''dφ/dt'' can all vary with time, but only in such a way that ''p&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;'' is constant.

===Pendulum on a movable support===

[[File:pendulumWithMovableSupport.svg|thumb|right|250px|Sketch of the situation with definition of the coordinates (click to enlarge)]]

Consider a pendulum of mass ''m'' and length ''ℓ'', which is attached to a support with mass ''M'', which can move along a line in the ''x''-direction. Let ''x'' be the coordinate along the line of the support, and let us denote the position of the pendulum by the angle ''θ'' from the vertical. The coordinates and velocity components of the pendulum bob are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rll}
&amp; x_\mathrm{pend} = x + \ell \sin \theta &amp; \quad \Rightarrow \quad \dot{x}_\mathrm{pend} = \dot{x} + \ell \dot{\theta} \cos \theta \\
&amp; y_\mathrm{pend} = - \ell \cos\theta &amp; \quad \Rightarrow \quad \dot{y}_\mathrm{pend} = \ell \dot{\theta} \sin \theta 
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

The generalized coordinates can be taken to be ''x'' and ''θ''. The kinetic energy of the system is then

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{1}{2} M \dot{x}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m \left( \dot{x}_\mathrm{pend}^2 + \dot{y}_\mathrm{pend}^2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

and the potential energy is

:&lt;math&gt; V = m g y_\mathrm{pend}  &lt;/math&gt;

giving the Lagrangian

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcl}
L &amp;=&amp; T - V \\
&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2} M \dot{x}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m \left[ \left( \dot x + \ell \dot\theta \cos \theta \right)^2 + \left( \ell \dot\theta \sin \theta \right)^2 \right] + m g \ell \cos \theta \\
&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(  M + m \right) \dot x^2 + m \dot x \ell \dot \theta \cos \theta + \frac{1}{2} m \ell^2 \dot \theta ^2 + m g \ell \cos \theta
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''x'' is absent from the Lagrangian, it is a cyclic coordinate. The conserved momentum is

:&lt;math&gt;p_x = \frac{\partial L }{\partial \dot{x}} = (M + m) \dot x + m \ell \dot\theta \cos\theta \,. &lt;/math&gt;

and the Lagrange equation for the support coordinate ''x'' is

:&lt;math&gt;  (M + m) \ddot x + m \ell \ddot\theta\cos\theta-m \ell \dot\theta ^2 \sin\theta = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrange equation for the angle ''θ'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left[ m( \dot x \ell \cos\theta + \ell^2 \dot\theta ) \right] + m \ell (\dot x \dot \theta + g) \sin\theta = 0;&lt;/math&gt;

and simplifying

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot\theta + \frac{\ddot x}{\ell} \cos\theta + \frac{g}{\ell} \sin\theta = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

These equations may look quite complicated, but finding them with Newton's laws would have required carefully identifying all forces, which would have been much more laborious and prone to errors. By considering limit cases, the correctness of this system can be verified: For example, &lt;math&gt;\ddot x \to 0&lt;/math&gt; should give the equations of motion for a [[simple pendulum]] that is at rest in some [[inertial frame]], while &lt;math&gt;\ddot\theta \to 0&lt;/math&gt; should give the equations for a pendulum in a constantly accelerating system, etc. Furthermore, it is trivial to obtain the results numerically, given suitable starting conditions and a chosen time step, by [[Numerical ordinary differential equations|stepping through the results iteratively]].

===Two-body central force problem===
{{main|Two-body problem|Central force}}

Two bodies of masses ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with position vectors '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are in orbit about each other due to an attractive [[central potential]] ''V''. We may write down the Lagrangian in terms of the position coordinates as they are, but it is an established procedure to convert the two-body problem into a one-body problem as follows. Introduce the [[Jacobi coordinates]]; the separation of the bodies '''r''' = '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the location of the [[center of mass]] '''R''' = (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The Lagrangian is then&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2005|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Padmanabhan|2000|edition=3rd|page=48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = nb&gt;The Lagrangian also can be written explicitly for a rotating frame. See Padmanabhan, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
L = \underbrace{\frac {1}{2} M \dot{\mathbf{R}}^2}_{L_{\text{cm}}} + \underbrace{\frac {1}{2} \mu \dot{\mathbf{r}}^2 - V(|\mathbf{r}|) }_{L_{\text{rel}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the total mass, ''μ'' = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the [[reduced mass]], and ''V'' the potential of the radial force, which depends only on the [[Norm (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the separation |'''r'''| = |'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|. The Lagrangian splits into a ''center-of-mass'' term ''L''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt; and a ''relative motion'' term ''L''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt;.

The Euler–Lagrange equation for '''R''' is simply

:&lt;math&gt;M\ddot{\mathbf{R}} = 0 \,, &lt;/math&gt;

which states the center of mass moves in a straight line at constant velocity.

Since the relative motion only depends on the magnitude of the separation, it is ideal to use polar coordinates (''r'', ''θ'') and take ''r'' = |'''r'''|,

:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{rel}=\frac{1}{2} \mu (\dot{r}^2 +r^2 \dot{\theta}^2 ) - V(r) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

so ''θ'' is an ignorable coordinate with the corresponding conserved (angular) momentum

:&lt;math&gt;p_\theta = \frac {\partial L_\text{rel}}{\partial \dot \theta} = \mu r^2 \dot \theta = \ell \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The radial coordinate ''r'' and angular velocity d''θ''/d''t'' can vary with time, but only in such a way that ''ℓ'' is constant. The Lagrange equation for ''r'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\mu r \dot \theta ^2 -\frac {dV}{dr} = \mu \ddot{r} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

This equation is identical to the radial equation obtained using Newton's laws in a ''co-rotating'' reference frame, that is, a frame rotating with the reduced mass so it appears stationary. Eliminating the angular velocity d''θ''/d''t'' from this radial equation,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|1998|pages=140–141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mu \ddot r = -\frac{\mathrm{d}V}{\mathrm{d}r} + \frac{\ell^2}{\mu r^3} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

which is the equation of motion for a one-dimensional problem in which a particle of mass ''μ'' is subjected to the inward central force − d''V''/d''r'' and a second outward force, called in this context the [[centrifugal force]]

:&lt;math&gt;F_{\mathrm{cf}} = \mu r \dot \theta ^2 = \frac {\ell^2}{\mu r^3} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Of course, if one remains entirely within the one-dimensional formulation, ''ℓ'' enters only as some imposed parameter of the external outward force, and its interpretation as angular momentum depends upon the more general two-dimensional problem from which the one-dimensional problem originated.

If one arrives at this equation using Newtonian mechanics in a co-rotating frame, the interpretation is evident as the centrifugal force in that frame due to the rotation of the frame itself. If one arrives at this equation directly by using the generalized coordinates (''r'', ''θ'') and simply following the Lagrangian formulation without thinking about frames at all, the interpretation is that the centrifugal force is an outgrowth of ''using polar coordinates''. As Hildebrand says:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hildebrand|1992 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Since such quantities are not true physical forces, they are often called ''inertia forces''. Their presence or absence depends, not upon the particular problem at hand, but ''upon the coordinate system chosen''." In particular, if Cartesian coordinates are chosen, the centrifugal force disappears, and the formulation involves only the central force itself, which provides the [[centripetal force]] for a curved motion.

This viewpoint, that fictitious forces originate in the choice of coordinates, often is expressed by users of the Lagrangian method. This view arises naturally in the Lagrangian approach, because the frame of reference is (possibly unconsciously) selected by the choice of coordinates. For example, see&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zak|Zbilut|Meyers|1997|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a comparison of Lagrangians in an inertial and in a noninertial frame of reference. See also the discussion of "total" and "updated" Lagrangian formulations in.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shabana|2008|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this usage of "inertial force" conflicts with the Newtonian idea of an inertial force. In the Newtonian view, an inertial force originates in the acceleration of the frame of observation (the fact that it is not an [[inertial frame of reference]]), not in the choice of coordinate system. To keep matters clear, it is safest to refer to the Lagrangian inertial forces as ''generalized'' inertial forces, to distinguish them from the Newtonian vector inertial forces. That is, one should avoid following Hildebrand when he says (p.&amp;nbsp;155) "we deal ''always'' with ''generalized'' forces, velocities accelerations, and momenta. For brevity, the adjective "generalized" will be omitted frequently."

It is known that the Lagrangian of a system is not unique. Within the Lagrangian formalism the Newtonian fictitious forces can be identified by the existence of alternative Lagrangians in which the fictitious forces disappear, sometimes found by exploiting the symmetry of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gannon|2006 |page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electromagnetism===

A test particle is a particle whose [[mass]] and [[electric charge|charge]] are assumed to be so small that its effect on external system is insignificant. It is often a hypothetical simplified point particle with no properties other than mass and charge. Real particles like [[electron]]s and [[up quark]]s are more complex and have additional terms in their Lagrangians.

The Lagrangian for a [[charged particle]] with [[electrical charge]] ''q'', interacting with an [[electromagnetic field]], is the prototypical example of a velocity-dependent potential. The electric [[scalar potential]] ''ϕ'' = ''ϕ''('''r''', ''t'') and magnetic [[vector potential]] '''A''' = '''A'''('''r''', ''t'') are defined from the [[electric field]] '''E''' = '''E'''('''r''', ''t'') and [[magnetic field]] '''B''' = '''B'''('''r''', ''t'') as follows;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = - \nabla\phi - \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t} \,, \quad \mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian of a massive charged test particle in an electromagnetic field is

:&lt;math&gt; L = \frac{m}{2} \dot{\mathbf{r}}^2 - q \phi  + q \dot{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{A} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which produces the [[Lorentz force]] law

:&lt;math&gt;m \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = q \mathbf{E} + q \dot{\mathbf{r}} \times \mathbf{B}  \,. &lt;/math&gt;

An interesting detail in this example is the generalized momentum conjugate to '''r''' is the ordinary momentum plus a contribution from the '''A''' field,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{r}}} = m \dot{\mathbf{r}} + q \mathbf{A} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

If '''r''' is cyclic, which happens if the ''ϕ'' and '''A''' fields are uniform (independent of position), then this expression for '''p''' given here is the conserved momentum, while the usual quantity ''m'''''v''' is not. This relation is also used in the [[minimal coupling]] prescription in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]].

==Extensions to include non-conservative forces==

[[Dissipation]] (i.e. non-conservative systems) can also be treated with an effective Lagrangian formulated by a certain doubling of the degrees of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kosyakov|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Galley|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hadar|Shahar|Kol|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Birnholtz|Hadar|Kol|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more general formulation, the forces could be both conservative and [[viscosity|viscous]]. If an appropriate transformation can be found from the '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Rayleigh]] suggests using a dissipation function, ''D'', of the following form:&lt;ref name="Torby 1984 page=271"&gt;{{harvnb|Torby|1984|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;D = \frac {1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^m \sum_{k=1}^m C_{j k} \dot{q}_j \dot{q}_k \,.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;'' are constants that are related to the damping coefficients in the physical system, though not necessarily equal to them. If ''D'' is defined this way, then&lt;ref name="Torby 1984 page=271"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q_j = - \frac {\partial V}{\partial q_j} - \frac {\partial D}{\partial \dot{q}_j}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left ( \frac {\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_j} \right ) - \frac {\partial L}{\partial q_j} + \frac {\partial D}{\partial \dot{q}_j} = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Other contexts and formulations==

The ideas in Lagrangian mechanics have numerous applications in other areas of physics, and can adopt generalized results from the calculus of variations.

===Alternative formulations of classical mechanics===

A closely related formulation of classical mechanics is [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. The Hamiltonian is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; H = \sum_{i=1}^n \dot{q}_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} - L \,. &lt;/math&gt;

and can be obtained by performing a [[Legendre transformation]] on the Lagrangian, which introduces new variables [[Canonical coordinates|canonically conjugate]] to the original variables. For example, given a set of generalized coordinates, the variables [[canonical coordinates|canonically conjugate]] are the generalized momenta. This doubles the number of variables, but makes differential equations first order. The Hamiltonian is a particularly ubiquitous quantity in [[quantum mechanics]] (see [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)]]).

[[Routhian mechanics]] is a hybrid formulation of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, which is not often used in practice but an efficient formulation for cyclic coordinates.

===Momentum space formulation===
{{main|Position and momentum space#Lagrangian mechanics}}

The Euler–Lagrange equations can also be formulated in terms of the generalized momenta rather than generalized coordinates. Performing a Legendre transformation on the generalized coordinate Lagrangian ''L''('''q''', d'''q'''/d''t'', ''t'') obtains the generalized momenta Lagrangian ''L''&amp;prime;('''p''', d'''p'''/d''t'', ''t'') in terms of the original Lagrangian, as well the EL equations in terms of the generalized momenta. Both Lagrangians contain the same information, and either can be used to solve for the motion of the system. In practice generalized coordinates are more convenient to use and interpret than generalized momenta.

===Higher derivatives of generalized coordinates===

There is no reason to restrict the derivatives of generalized coordinates to first order only. It is possible to derive modified EL equations for a Lagrangian containing higher order derivatives, see [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] for details.

===Optics===

{{main|Hamiltonian optics}}

Lagrangian mechanics can be applied to [[geometrical optics]], by applying variational principles to rays of light in a medium, and solving the EL equations gives the equations of the paths the light rays follow.

===Relativistic formulation===
{{main|Relativistic Lagrangian mechanics}}

Lagrangian mechanics can be formulated in [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. Some features of Lagrangian mechanics are retained in the relativistic theories but difficulties quickly appear in other respects. In particular, the EL equations take the same form, and the connection between cyclic coordinates and conserved momenta still applies, however the Lagrangian must be modified and is not simply the kinetic minus the potential energy of a particle. Also, it is not straightforward to handle multiparticle systems in a [[manifestly covariant]] way, it may be possible if a particular frame of reference is singled out.

===Quantum mechanics===

In [[quantum mechanics]], [[action (physics)|action]] and quantum-mechanical [[phase (waves)|phase]] are related via [[Planck's constant]], and the [[principle of stationary action]] can be understood in terms of [[constructive interference]] of [[wave function]]s.

In 1948, [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] discovered the [[path integral formulation]] extending the [[principle of least action]] to [[quantum mechanics]] for [[electrons]] and [[photons]]. In this formulation, particles travel every possible path between the initial and final states; the probability of a specific final state is obtained by summing over all possible trajectories leading to it. In the classical regime, the path integral formulation cleanly reproduces Hamilton's principle, and [[Fermat's principle]] in [[optics]].

===Classical field theory===

In Lagrangian mechanics, the generalized coordinates form a discrete set of variables that define the configuration of a system. In [[classical field theory]], the physical system is not a set of discrete particles, but rather a continuous field ''ϕ''('''r''', ''t'') defined over a region of 3d space. Associated with the field is a [[Lagrangian density]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\phi, \nabla \phi, \partial\phi/\partial t , \mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;

defined in terms of the field and its space and time derivatives at a location '''r''' and time ''t''. Analogous to the particle case, for non-relativistic applications the Lagrangian density is also the kinetic energy density of the field, minus its potential energy density (this is not true in general, and the Lagrangian density has to be "reverse engineered"). The Lagrangian is then the [[volume integral]] of the Lagrangian density over 3d space

:&lt;math&gt; L(t) = \int  \mathcal{L} \, \mathrm{d}^3 \mathbf{r} &lt;/math&gt;

where d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''r''' is a 3d [[Total differential#Differentials in several variables|differential]] [[volume element]]. The Lagrangian is a function of time since the Lagrangian density has implicit space dependence via the fields, and may have explicit spatial dependence, but these are removed in the integral, leaving only time in as the variable for the Lagrangian.

===Noether's theorem===

The action principle, and the Lagrangian formalism, are tied closely to [[Noether's theorem]], which connects physical [[conserved quantity|conserved quantities]] to continuous [[symmetry (physics)|symmetries]] of a physical system.

If the Lagrangian is invariant under a symmetry, then the resulting equations of motion are also invariant under that symmetry. This characteristic is very helpful in showing that theories are consistent with either [[special relativity]] or [[general relativity]].

{{Software development process}}

'''Lean software development''' is a translation of [[lean manufacturing]] principles and practices to the [[software development]] domain.  Adapted from the [[Toyota Production System]],&lt;ref&gt;Yasuhiro Monden (1998), ''Toyota Production System, An Integrated Approach to Just-In-Time'', Third edition, Norcross, GA: Engineering &amp; Management Press, {{ISBN|0-412-83930-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is emerging with the support of a pro-lean subculture within the [[Agile software development|Agile]] community. Lean offers a solid conceptual framework, values and principles, as well as good practices, derived from experience, that support agile organizations.

== Origin ==

The term '''lean software development''' originated in a book by the same name, written by Mary Poppendieck and Tom Poppendieck.&lt;ref name="1Poppendieck2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Poppendieck|author2=Tom Poppendieck|title=Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQk4S7asBi4C&amp;pg=PA182|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-15078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book restates traditional [[Lean manufacturing#Overview|lean principles]], as well as a set of 22 ''tools'' and compares the tools to corresponding agile practices.  The Poppendiecks' involvement in the [[Agile software development]] community, including talks at several Agile conferences &lt;ref&gt;Mary Poppendieck: "The role of leadership in software development"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypEMdjslEOI&lt;/ref&gt; has resulted in such concepts being more widely accepted within the Agile community.

== Lean principles ==

Lean development can be summarized by seven principles, very close in concept to lean manufacturing principles:&lt;ref name="2Poppendieck2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Poppendieck|author2=Tom Poppendieck|title=Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQk4S7asBi4C&amp;pg=PA182|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-15078-3|pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eliminate waste ===
Lean philosophy regards everything not adding value to the customer as waste ([[muda (Japanese term)|''muda'']]).  Such waste may include:&lt;ref name="3Poppendieck2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Poppendieck|author2=Tom Poppendieck|title=Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQk4S7asBi4C&amp;pg=PA182|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-15078-3|pages=19–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Partially done work
# [[Hierarchical organization|Extra processes]]
# [[Software bloat|Extra features]]
# [[Task switching (psychology)|Task switching]]
# Waiting
# Motion
# [[Software bug|Defects]]
# [[Management|Management activities]]

Industry research revealed these software development wastes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sedano|first1=Todd|last2=Ralph|first2=Paul|last3=Péraire|first3=Cécile|title=Software Development Waste|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313360479_Software_Development_Waste|publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Building the wrong feature or product
# Mismanaging the backlog
# Rework
# Unnecessarily complex solutions
# Extraneous cognitive load
# Psychological distress
# Waiting/multitasking
# Knowledge loss
# Ineffective communication.
 
In order to eliminate waste, one should be able to recognize it. If some activity could be bypassed or the result could be achieved without it, it is waste. Partially done coding eventually abandoned during the [[software development process|development process]] is waste. Extra processes like paperwork and features not often used by customers are waste. Switching people between tasks is waste. Waiting for other activities, teams, processes is waste. Motion required to complete work is waste. Defects and lower quality are waste. Managerial overhead not producing real value is waste.

A [[value stream mapping]] technique is used to identify waste. The second step is to point out sources of waste and to eliminate them.  Waste-removal should take place iteratively until even seemingly essential processes and procedures are liquidated.

=== Amplify learning ===
Software development is a continuous learning process based on iterations when writing code. Software design is a problem solving process involving the developers writing the code and what they have learned. Software value is measured in fitness for use and not in conformance to requirements.

Instead of adding more documentation or detailed planning, different ideas could be tried by writing code and building. The process of user requirements gathering could be simplified by presenting screens to the end-users and getting their input. The accumulation of defects should be prevented by running tests as soon as the code is written.

The learning process is sped up by usage of short iteration cycles – each one coupled with refactoring and [[integration testing]]. Increasing feedback via short feedback sessions with customers helps when determining the current phase of development and adjusting efforts for future improvements. During those short sessions both [[customer representative]]s and the development team learn more about the domain problem and figure out possible solutions for further development. Thus the customers better understand their needs, based on the existing result of development efforts, and the developers learn how to better satisfy those needs.  Another idea in the communication and learning process with a customer is set-based development – this concentrates on communicating the constraints of the future solution and not the possible solutions, thus promoting the birth of the solution via dialogue with the customer.{{Jargon-statement|date=June 2018}}

=== Decide as late as possible ===
As [[software development]] is always associated with some uncertainty, better results should be achieved with a ''set-based'' or ''options-based'' approach, delaying decisions as much as possible until they can be made based on facts and not on uncertain assumptions and predictions. The more complex a system is, the more capacity for change should be built into it, thus enabling the delay of important and crucial commitments. The iterative approach promotes this principle – the ability to adapt to changes and correct mistakes, which might be very costly if discovered after the release of the system.

:With set-based development: If a new brake system is needed for a car, for example, three teams may design solutions to the same problem. Each team learns about the problem space and designs a potential solution. As a solution is deemed unreasonable, it is cut. At the end of a period, the surviving designs are compared and one is chosen, perhaps with some modifications based on learning from the others - a great example of deferring commitment until the last possible moment. Software decisions could also benefit from this practice to minimize the risk brought on by big up-front design. Additionally, there would then be multiple implementations that work correctly, yet are different (implementation-wise, internally). These could be used to implement fault-tolerant systems which check all inputs and outputs for correctness, across the multiple implementations, simultaneously.

An [[agile software development]] approach can move the building of options earlier for customers, thus delaying certain crucial decisions until customers have realized their needs better. This also allows later adaptation to changes and the prevention of costly earlier technology-bounded decisions. This does not mean that no planning should be involved – on the contrary, planning activities should be concentrated on the different options and adapting to the current situation, as well as clarifying confusing situations by establishing patterns for rapid action. Evaluating different options is effective as soon as it is realized that they are not free, but provide the needed flexibility for late decision making.

=== Deliver as fast as possible ===
In the era of rapid technology evolution, it is not the biggest that survives, but the fastest. The sooner the end product is delivered without major defects, the sooner feedback can be received, and incorporated into the next [[iteration]]. The shorter the iterations, the better the learning and communication within the team. With speed, decisions can be delayed. Speed assures the fulfilling of the customer's present needs and not what they required yesterday.  This gives them the opportunity to delay making up their minds about what they really require until they gain better knowledge. Customers value rapid delivery of a [[Quality (business)|quality]] product.

The [[Just in time (business)|just-in-time]] production ideology could be applied to [[software development]], recognizing its specific requirements and environment. This is achieved by presenting the needed result and letting the team organize itself and divide the tasks for accomplishing the needed result for a specific [[Iteration#Project management|iteration]]. At the beginning, the customer provides the needed input.  This could be simply presented in small cards or [[User story|stories]] – the developers estimate the time needed for the [[implementation]] of each card. Thus the work organization changes into [[Kanban cards|self-pulling system]] – each morning during a [[stand-up meeting]], each member of the team reviews what has been done yesterday, what is to be done today and tomorrow, and prompts for any inputs needed from colleagues or the customer. This requires transparency of the process, which is also beneficial for team communication.

=== Empower the team ===
There has been a traditional belief in most businesses about the [[decision-making]] in the organization – the managers tell the workers how to do their own job. In a "Work-Out technique", the roles are turned – the managers are taught how to listen to the [[Software developer|developers]], so they can explain better what actions might be taken, as well as provide suggestions for improvements.  The lean approach follows the Agile Principle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/|title=12 Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto - Agile Alliance|author=|date=4 November 2015|website=agilealliance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; "find good people and let them do their own job,"&lt;ref name="LinesAmbler2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Lines|author2=Scott W. Ambler|title=Disciplined Agile Delivery: A Practitioner's Guide to Agile Software Delivery in the Enterprise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SLIkMhB2ew0C&amp;pg=PA54|year=2012|publisher=IBM Press|isbn=978-0-13-281013-5|pages=54–}}&lt;/ref&gt; encouraging progress, catching errors, and removing impediments, but not micro-managing.

Another mistaken belief has been the consideration of people as [[resources]]. People might be [[resources]] from the point of view of a statistical data sheet, but in [[software development]], as well as any organizational business, people do need something more than just the list of tasks and the assurance that they will not be disturbed during the completion of the tasks. People need motivation and a higher purpose to work for – purpose within the reachable reality, with the assurance that the team might choose its own commitments. The developers should be given access to the customer; the [[team leader]] should provide support and help in difficult situations, as well as ensure that scepticism does not ruin the team’s spirit.

=== Build integrity in ===
The customer needs to have an overall experience of the System. This is the so-called perceived integrity: how it is being advertised, delivered, deployed, accessed, how intuitive its use is, its price and how well it solves problems.

Conceptual integrity means that the system’s separate components work well together as a whole with balance between flexibility, maintainability, efficiency, and responsiveness. This could be achieved by understanding the problem domain and solving it at the same time, not sequentially. The needed information is received in small batch pieces – not in one vast chunk -  preferably by face-to-face communication and not any written documentation. The information flow should be constant in both directions – from customer to developers and back, thus avoiding the large stressful amount of information after long development in isolation.

One of the healthy ways towards integral architecture is [[refactoring]].  As more features are added to the original code base, the harder it becomes to add further improvements. Refactoring is about keeping simplicity, clarity, minimum number of features in the code. Repetitions in the code are signs of bad code designs and should be avoided. The complete and automated building process should be accompanied by a complete and automated suite of developer and customer tests, having the same versioning, synchronization and semantics as the current state of the System. At the end the integrity should be verified with thorough testing, thus ensuring the System does what the customer expects it to. Automated tests are also considered part of the production process, and therefore if they do not add value they should be considered waste.  Automated testing should not be a goal, but rather a means to an end, specifically the reduction of defects.

=== See the whole ===
Software systems nowadays are not simply the sum of their parts, but also the product of their interactions. Defects in software tend to accumulate during the development process – by decomposing the big tasks into smaller tasks, and by standardizing different stages of development, the root causes of defects should be found and eliminated. The larger the system, the more organizations that are involved in its development and the more parts are developed by different teams, the greater the importance of having well defined relationships between different vendors, in order to produce a system with smoothly interacting components. During a longer period of development, a stronger subcontractor network is far more beneficial than short-term profit optimizing, which does not enable win-win relationships.

Lean thinking has to be understood well by all members of a project, before implementing in a concrete, real-life situation. "Think big, act small, fail fast; learn rapidly"&lt;ref name="PoppendieckPoppendieck2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Poppendieck|author2=Tom Poppendieck|title=Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQk4S7asBi4C&amp;pg=PA182|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-15078-3|pages=182–}}&lt;/ref&gt; – these slogans summarize the importance of understanding the field and the suitability of implementing lean principles along the whole software development process. Only when all of the lean principles are implemented together, combined with strong "common sense" with respect to the working environment, is there a basis for success in [[software development]].

== Lean software practices ==

Lean software development practices, or what the Poppendiecks call "tools" are restated slightly from the original equivalents in [[Agile software development]].   Examples of such practices include:

* Seeing [[muda (Japanese term)|waste]]
* [[Value stream mapping]]
* [[Theory of constraints|Set-based development]]
* [[Kanban cards|Pull systems]]
* [[Queuing theory]]
* [[Motivation]]
* [[Measurements]]
* [[Test-driven development]]
* [[Trunk-based development]]

Since Agile Software Development is an umbrella term for a set of methods and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Agile Manifesto, Lean Software Development is considered an Agile Software Development Method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/|title=What is Agile Software Development?|author=|date=29 June 2015|website=agilealliance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Life-cycle assessment''' ('''LCA''', also known as '''life-cycle analysis''', '''ecobalance''', and '''cradle-to-grave analysis''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gdrc.org/uem/lca/lca-define.html "Defining Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)."] US Environmental Protection Agency. 17 October 2010. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; is a technique to assess environmental impacts associated with all the stages of a product's life from raw material extraction through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling. Designers use this process to help critique their products. LCAs can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental concerns by:
* Compiling an inventory of relevant energy and material inputs and environmental releases;
* Evaluating the potential impacts associated with identified inputs and releases;
* Interpreting the results to help make a more informed decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/std/lca/lca.html "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)."] US Environmental Protection Agency. 6 August 2010. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and purpose==

The goal of LCA is to compare the full range of environmental effects assignable to products and services by quantifying all inputs and outputs of material flows and assessing how these material flows affect the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Overview|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/400/life-cycle-assessment-lca-overview|website=sftool.gov|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information is used to improve processes, support policy and provide a sound basis for informed decisions.&lt;ref name="ecometrica.com"&gt;[http://ecometrica.com/services/#lca "GHG Product Life Cycle Assessments"]. ''Ecometrica''. Retrieved on: 25 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''life cycle'' refers to the notion that a fair, [[holistic]] assessment requires the assessment of raw-material production, manufacture, [[Sustainable distribution|distribution]], use and [[Waste management|disposal]] including all intervening transportation steps necessary or caused by the product's existence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

There are two main types of LCA. Attributional LCAs seek to establish (or attribute) the burdens associated with the production and use of a product, or with a specific service or process, at a point in time (typically the recent past). Consequential LCAs seek to identify the environmental consequences of a decision or a proposed change in a system under study (oriented to the future), which means that market and economic implications of a decision may have to be taken into account. Social LCA is under development&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.fr/shared/publications/pdf/DTIx1164xPA-guidelines_sLCA.pdf Guidelines for Social Life Cycle Assessment of Products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118063849/http://www.unep.fr/shared/publications/pdf/DTIx1164xPA-guidelines_sLCA.pdf |date=18 January 2012 }}, United Nations Environment Programme, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; as a different approach to [[Life Cycle Thinking|life cycle thinking]] intended to assess social implications or potential impacts. Social LCA should be considered as an approach that is complementary to environmental LCA.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The procedures of life cycle assessment (LCA) are part of the [[ISO 14000]] environmental management standards: in ISO 14040:2006 and 14044:2006. (ISO 14044 replaced earlier versions of ISO 14041 to ISO 14043.) [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] product life cycle assessments can also comply with specifications such as [[Publicly Available Specification|PAS]] 2050 and the [[Carbon emissions reporting#Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 28GHGP.29|GHG Protocol Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard]].&lt;ref name="ecometrica.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/forms/PASs/PAS-2050 "PAS 2050:2011 Specification for the assessment of the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of goods and services"].

==Four main phases==
[[File:PhasesOfLifeCycleAnalysis.png|250px|right|thumb|Illustration of LCA phases]]

According to the ISO 14040&lt;ref&gt;ISO 14040 (2006): Environmental management – Life cycle assessment – Principles and framework, International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), Geneve&lt;/ref&gt; and 14044&lt;ref&gt;ISO 14044 (2006): Environmental management – Life cycle assessment – Requirements and guidelines, International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), Geneve&lt;/ref&gt; standards, a Life Cycle Assessment is carried out in four distinct phases as illustrated in the figure shown to the right. The phases are often interdependent in that the results of one phase will inform how other phases are completed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Goal and scope===

An LCA starts with an explicit statement of the goal and scope of the study, which sets out the context of the study and explains how and to whom the results are to be communicated. This is a key step and the ISO standards require that the goal and scope of an LCA be clearly defined and consistent with the intended application. The goal and scope document therefore includes technical details that guide subsequent work:
* '''the functional unit''', which defines what precisely is being studied and quantifies the service delivered by the product system, providing a reference to which the inputs and outputs can be related. Further, the functional unit is an important basis that enables alternative goods, or services, to be compared and analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;Rebitzer, G. et al. (2004). Life cycle assessment
Part 1: Framework, goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, and applications. Environment International. 30(2004), 701-720.&lt;/ref&gt; So to explain this a functional system which is inputs, processes and outputs contains a functional unit, that fulfills a function, for example paint is covering a wall, making a functional unit of 1m² covered for 10 years. The functional flow would be the items necessary for that function, so this would be a brush, tin of paint and the paint itself. 
* '''the system boundaries'''; which are delimitations of which processes that should be included in the analysis of a product system.&lt;ref&gt;Finnveden, G., Hauschild, M.Z., Ekvall, T., Guinée, J., Heijungs, R., Hellweq, S., Koehler, A., Pennington, D. &amp; Suh, S. (2009). Recent developments in Life Cycle Assessment.
Journal of Environmental Management 91(1), 1-21. 
&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''any assumptions and limitations''';{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
* '''the allocation methods''' used to partition the environmental load of a process when several products or functions share the same process; allocation is commonly dealt with in one of three ways: system expansion, substitution and partition. Doing this is not easy and different methods may give different results{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

and
* '''the impact categories''' chosen for example human [[toxicity]], [[smog]], [[global warming]], [[eutrophication]].

===Life cycle inventory===
[[File:LCI Diagram.png|thumb|This is an example of a Life-cycle inventory (LCI) diagram]]

Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) analysis involves creating an inventory of flows from and to nature for a product system. Inventory flows include inputs of water, energy, and raw materials, and releases to air, land, and water. To develop the inventory, a flow model of the technical system is constructed using data on inputs and outputs. The flow model is typically illustrated with a flow chart that includes the activities that are going to be assessed in the relevant supply chain and gives a clear picture of the technical system boundaries. The input and output data needed for the construction of the model are collected for all activities within the system boundary, including from the supply chain (referred to as inputs from the technosphere).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The data must be related to the functional unit defined in the goal and scope definition. Data can be presented in tables and some interpretations can be made already at this stage. The results of the inventory is an LCI which provides information about all inputs and outputs in the form of elementary flow to and from the environment from all the unit processes involved in the study.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Inventory flows can number in the hundreds depending on the system boundary. For product LCAs at either the generic (i.e., representative industry averages) or brand-specific level, that data is typically collected through survey questionnaires. At an industry level, care has to be taken to ensure that questionnaires are completed by a representative sample of producers, leaning toward neither the best nor the worst, and fully representing any regional differences due to energy use, material sourcing or other factors. The questionnaires cover the full range of inputs and outputs, typically aiming to account for 99% of the mass of a product, 99% of the energy used in its production and any environmentally sensitive flows, even if they fall within the 1% level of inputs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

One area where data access is likely to be difficult is flows from the technosphere. The technosphere is more simply defined as the man-made world. Considered by geologists as secondary resources, these resources are in theory 100% recyclable; however, in a practical sense, the primary goal is salvage.&lt;ref&gt;Steinbach, V. and Wellmer, F. (May 2010). "Review: Consumption and Use of Non-Renewable Mineral and Energy Raw Materials from an Economic Geology Point of View." Sustainability. 2(5), pgs. 1408-1430. Retrieved from &lt;http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/2/5/1408&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For an LCI, these technosphere products (supply chain products) are those that have been produced by man and unfortunately those completing a questionnaire about a process which uses a man-made product as a means to an end will be unable to specify how much of a given input they use. Typically, they will not have access to data concerning inputs and outputs for previous production processes of the product. The entity undertaking the LCA must then turn to secondary sources if it does not already have that data from its own previous studies. National databases or data sets that come with LCA-practitioner tools, or that can be readily accessed, are the usual sources for that information. Care must then be taken to ensure that the secondary data source properly reflects regional or national conditions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===LCI Methods===
* Process LCA
* Economic Input Output LCA
* Hybrid Approach

===Life cycle impact assessment===

Inventory analysis is followed by impact assessment. This phase of LCA is aimed at evaluating the significance of potential environmental impacts based on the LCI flow results. Classical life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) consists of the following mandatory elements:{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

* selection of impact categories, category indicators, and characterization models;
* the classification stage, where the inventory parameters are sorted and assigned to specific impact categories; and
* impact measurement, where the categorized LCI flows are characterized, using one of many possible LCIA methodologies, into common equivalence units that are then summed to provide an overall impact category total.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In many LCAs, characterization concludes the LCIA analysis; this is also the last compulsory stage according to ISO 14044:2006. However, in addition to the above mandatory LCIA steps, other optional LCIA elements – [[Normalization (statistics)|normalization]], grouping, and weighting – may be conducted depending on the goal and scope of the LCA study. In normalization, the results of the impact categories from the study are usually compared with the total impacts in the region of interest, the U.S. for example. [[Grouped data|Grouping]] consists of sorting and possibly [[ranking]] the impact categories. During [[weighting]], the different environmental impacts are weighted relative to each other so that they can then be summed to get a single number for the total environmental impact. ISO 14044:2006 generally advises against weighting, stating that “weighting, shall not be used in LCA studies intended to be used in comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public”. This advice is often ignored, resulting in comparisons that can reflect a high degree of subjectivity as a result of weighting.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Life cycle impacts can also be categorized under the several phases of the development, production, use, and disposal of a product. Broadly speaking, these impacts can be divided into "First Impacts,"&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Brian D. Future-Proof Building Materials: A Life Cycle Analysis. Intersections and Adjacencies. Proceedings of the 2015 Building Educators’ Society Conference, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT. Gines, Jacob, Carraher, Erin, and Galarze, Jose, editors. Pp. 123-130.&lt;/ref&gt; use impacts, and end of life impacts. "First Impacts" include extraction of raw materials, manufacturing (conversion of raw materials into a product), transportation of the product to a market or site, construction/installation, and the beginning of the use or occupancy. Use impacts include physical impacts of operating the product or facility (such as energy, water, etc.), maintenance, renovation and repairs (required to continue to use the product or facility). End of life impacts include demolition and processing of waste or recyclable materials.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Interpretation===

Life Cycle Interpretation is a systematic technique to identify, quantify, check, and evaluate information from the results of the life cycle inventory and/or the life cycle impact assessment. The results from the inventory analysis and impact assessment are summarized during the interpretation phase. The outcome of the interpretation phase is a set of conclusions and recommendations for the study. According to ISO 14040:2006, the interpretation should include:{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

* identification of significant issues based on the results of the LCI and LCIA phases of an LCA;
* evaluation of the study considering completeness, sensitivity and consistency checks; and
* conclusions, limitations and recommendations.

A key purpose of performing life cycle interpretation is to determine the level of confidence in the final results and communicate them in a fair, complete, and accurate manner. Interpreting the results of an LCA is not as simple as "3 is better than 2, therefore Alternative A is the best choice"! Interpreting the results of an LCA starts with understanding the accuracy of the results, and ensuring they meet the goal of the study. This is accomplished by identifying the data elements that contribute significantly to each impact category, [[Sensitivity analysis|evaluating the sensitivity]] of these significant data elements, assessing the completeness and consistency of the study, and drawing conclusions and recommendations based on a clear understanding of how the LCA was conducted and the results were developed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====Reference test====

More specifically, the best alternative is the one that the LCA shows to have the least cradle-to-grave environmental negative impact on land, sea, and air resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Curran |first=Mary Ann |title=Life Cycle Analysis: Principles and Practice |url=http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/lcaccess/pdfs/chapter1_frontmatter_lca101.pdf |publisher=Scientific Applications International Corporation |accessdate=24 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018024516/http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/lcaccess/pdfs/chapter1_frontmatter_lca101.pdf |archivedate=18 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LCA uses==

Based on a survey of LCA practitioners carried out in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cooper | first = J.S. | last2 = Fava | first2 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Life Cycle Assessment Practitioner Survey: Summary of Results
 | journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology | doi = 10.1162/jiec.2006.10.4.12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
LCA is mostly used to support business strategy (18%) and R&amp;D (18%), as input to product or process design (15%), in education (13%) and for labeling or product declarations (11%). LCA will be continuously integrated into the built environment as tools such as the European ENSLIC Building project guidelines for buildings or developed and implemented, which provide practitioners guidance on methods to implement LCI data into the planning and design process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malmqvist|first=T|last2=Glaumann|first2=M| last3= Scarpellini|first3=S|last4=Zabalza|first4=I|last5=Aranda|first5=A|title=Life cycle assessment in buildings: The ENSLIC simplified method and guidelines|journal=Energy|date=April 2011|volume=36|issue=4|pages=1900–1907|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544210001453|accessdate=31 October 2012|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2010.03.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major corporations all over the world are either undertaking LCA in house or commissioning studies, while governments support the development of national databases to support LCA. Of particular note is the growing use of LCA for ISO Type III labels called Environmental Product Declarations, defined as "quantified environmental data for a product with pre-set categories of parameters based on the ISO 14040 series of standards, but not excluding additional environmental information".&lt;ref name=Singh&amp;baksshi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreenstandard.org/EPD_System.html EPD_System] – '''www.thegreenstandard.org'''&lt;/ref&gt; These third-party certified LCA-based labels provide an increasingly important basis for assessing the relative environmental merits of competing products. Third-party certification plays a major role in today's industry. Independent certification can show a company's dedication to safer and environmental friendlier products to customers and NGOs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

LCA also has major roles in [[environmental impact assessment]], integrated [[waste management]] and pollution studies. A recent study evaluated the LCA of a laboratory scale plant for oxygen enriched air production coupled with its economic evaluation in an holistic eco-design standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galli|first=F|last2=Pirola|first2=C| last3= Previtali|first3=D|last4=Manenti|first4=F|last5=Bianchi|first5=C|title=Eco design LCA of an innovative lab scale plant for the production of oxygen-enriched air.

==Data analysis==

A life cycle analysis is only as valid as its [[data]]; therefore, it is crucial that data used for the completion of a life cycle analysis are accurate and current. When comparing different life cycle analyses with one another, it is crucial that equivalent data are available for both products or processes in question. If one product has a much higher availability of data, it cannot be justly compared to another product which has less detailed data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Scientific Applications International Corporation |title=Life cycle assessment: principles and practice |page=88 |date=May 2006 |url=http://www.epa.gov/NRMRL/lcaccess/pdfs/600r06060.pdf 
 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123001105/http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/lcaccess/pdfs/600r06060.pdf |archivedate=23 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic types of LCA data – unit process data and environmental input-output data (EIO), where the latter is based on national economic input-output data.&lt;ref name=greet/&gt; Unit process data are derived from direct surveys of companies or plants producing the product of interest, carried out at a unit process level defined by the system boundaries for the study.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Data validity is an ongoing concern for life cycle analyses. Due to [[globalization]] and the rapid pace of [[research and development]], new materials and manufacturing methods are continually being introduced to the market. This makes it both very important and very difficult to use up-to-date information when performing an LCA. If an LCA’s conclusions are to be valid, the data must be recent; however, the data-gathering process takes time. If a product and its related processes have not undergone significant revisions since the last LCA data was collected, data validity is not a problem. However, [[consumer electronics]] such as [[cell phones]] can be redesigned as often as every 9 to 12 months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29258026/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/planned-obsolescence-cell-phone-models/|title=Planned obsolescence: cell phone models | author= Suzanne Choney|date=24 February 2009|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a need for ongoing data collection.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The life cycle considered usually consists of a number of stages including: materials extraction, processing and manufacturing, product use, and product disposal. If the most environmentally harmful of these stages can be determined, then impact on the environment can be efficiently reduced by focusing on making changes for that particular phase. For example, the most energy-intensive life phase of an airplane or car is during use due to fuel consumption. One of the most effective ways to increase fuel efficiency is to decrease vehicle weight, and thus, car and airplane manufacturers can decrease environmental impact in a significant way by replacing heavier materials with lighter ones such as aluminium or carbon fiber-reinforced elements. The reduction during the use phase should be more than enough to balance additional raw material or [[manufacturing cost]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Data sources are typically large databases, it is not appropriate to compare two options if different data sources have been used to source the data. 
Data sources include:
* soca

Calculations for impact can then be done by hand, but it is more usual to streamline the process by using software. This can range from a simple spreadsheet, where the user enters the data manually to a fully automated program, where the user is not aware of the source data.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Variants==

===Cradle-to-grave===

Cradle-to-grave is the full Life Cycle Assessment from resource extraction ('cradle') to use phase and disposal phase ('grave'). For example, trees produce paper, which can be recycled into low-energy production [[cellulose]] (fiberised paper) [[Building insulation|insulation]], then used as an energy-saving device in the ceiling of a home for 40 years, saving 2,000 times the [[fossil fuel|fossil-fuel]] energy used in its production. After 40 years the [[cellulose]] fibers are replaced and the old fibers are disposed of, possibly incinerated. All inputs and outputs are considered for all the phases of the life cycle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Cradle-to-gate===

Cradle-to-gate is an assessment of a ''partial'' product life cycle from resource extraction (''cradle'') to the factory gate (i.e., before it is transported to the consumer). The use phase and disposal phase of the product are omitted in this case. Cradle-to-gate assessments are sometimes the basis for [[environmental product declarations]] (EPD) termed business-to-business EDPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environdec.com/pageId.asp?id=301&amp;menu=2,2,26 EPD-The Green Yardstick]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the significant uses of the cradle-to-gate approach compiles the life cycle inventory (LCI) using cradle-to-gate. This allows the LCA to collect all of the impacts leading up to resources being purchased by the facility. They can then add the steps involved in their transport to plant and manufacture process to more easily produce their own cradle-to-gate values for their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franklin Associates, A Division of Eastern Research Group|title=Cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Inventory of Nine Plastic Resins and Four Polyurethane Precursors|url=http://www51.honeywell.com/sm/chemicals/enovate/common/documents/FP_Enovate_July_2010_Report_by_the_American_Chemistry_Council_Manual.pdf|publisher=The Plastics Division of the American Chemistry Council|accessdate=31 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206012658/http://www51.honeywell.com/sm/chemicals/enovate/common/documents/FP_Enovate_July_2010_Report_by_the_American_Chemistry_Council_Manual.pdf|archivedate=6 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cradle-to-cradle or closed loop production===
{{see also|Cradle to Cradle Design}}

Cradle-to-cradle is a specific kind of cradle-to-grave assessment, where the end-of-life disposal step for the product is a [[recycling]] process. It is a method used to minimize the environmental impact of products by employing sustainable production, operation, and disposal practices and aims to incorporate social responsibility into product development.&lt;ref&gt;"Cradle-to-cradle definition." Ecomii. 19 October 2010. Web. &lt;http://www.ecomii.com/ecopedia/cradle-to-cradle&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; From the recycling process originate new, identical products (e.g., asphalt pavement from discarded asphalt pavement, glass bottles from collected glass bottles), or different products (e.g., glass wool insulation from collected glass bottles).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Allocation of burden for products in open loop production systems presents considerable challenges for LCA. Various methods, such as the [[avoided burden]] approach have been proposed to deal with the issues involved.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Gate-to-gate===

Gate-to-gate is a partial LCA looking at only one value-added process in the entire production chain. Gate-to-gate modules may also later be linked in their appropriate production chain to form a complete cradle-to-gate evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Jiménez-González, C.; Kim, S.; Overcash, M. Methodology for developing gate-to-gate Life cycle inventory information. The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment 2000, 5, 153–159.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Well-to-wheel===

Well-to-wheel is the specific LCA used for [[transport]] [[fuel]]s and vehicles. The analysis is often broken down into stages entitled "well-to-station", or "well-to-tank", and "station-to-wheel" or "tank-to-wheel", or "plug-to-wheel". The first stage, which incorporates the feedstock or fuel production and processing and fuel delivery or energy transmission, and is called the "upstream" stage, while the stage that deals with vehicle operation itself is sometimes called the "downstream" stage. The well-to-wheel analysis is commonly used to assess total energy consumption, or the [[energy conversion efficiency]] and [[Exhaust gas|emission]]s impact of [[marine vessel]]s, [[aircraft]] and [[motor vehicle]]s, including their [[carbon footprint]], and the fuels used in each of these transport modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/TA/339.pdf|title=Well-to-Wheels Analysis of Advanced Fuel/Vehicle Systems — A North American Study of Energy Use, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Criteria Pollutant Emissions|publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]]|first1=Norman|last1= Brinkman|first2=Michael|last2=Wang|first3=Trudy |last3= Weber|first4=Thomas|last4=Darlington|date=May 2005|accessdate=28 February 2011}} ''See EXECUTIVE SUMMARY – ES.1 Background, pp1''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VDI&gt;{{cite web|title=Vehicle Electrification - Quo Vadis|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233987248_Vehicle_Electrification_-_Quo_Vadis__Fahrzeugelektrifizierung_-_Quo_Vadis | last1=Brinkman| first1=Norman| first2=Ulrich| last2=Eberle|first3=Volker|last3=Formanski|first4=Uwe-Dieter|last4=Grebe|first5=Roland|last5=Matthe|publisher=[[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]] |date=15 April 2012| accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2007publications/CEC-600-2007-004/CEC-600-2007-004-REV.PDF|title=Full Fuel Cycle Assessment: Well-To-Wheels Energy Inputs, Emissions, and Water Impacts|publisher=California Energy Commission|date=1 August 2007|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Green-car-landing-page/Green-car-glossary/ |title=Green Car Glossary: Well to wheel |publisher=[[Car Magazine]] |accessdate=28 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504030517/http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Green-car-landing-page/Green-car-glossary/ |archivedate= 4 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; WtW analysis is useful for reflecting the different efficiencies and emissions of energy technologies and fuels at both the upstream and downstream stages, giving a more complete picture of real emissions.

The well-to-wheel variant has a significant input on a model developed by the [[Argonne National Laboratory]]. The Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model was developed to evaluate the impacts of new fuels and vehicle technologies. The model evaluates the impacts of fuel use using a well-to-wheel evaluation while a traditional cradle-to-grave approach is used to determine the impacts from the vehicle itself. The model reports energy use, [[greenhouse gas emission]]s, and six additional pollutants: [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs), [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), [[nitrogen oxide]] (NOx), [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] with size smaller than 10 micrometre (PM10), particulate matter with size smaller than 2.5 micrometre (PM2.5), and [[sulfur oxide]]s (SOx).&lt;ref name=greet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greet.es.anl.gov/|title=How Does GREET Work?|publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]]|date=3 September 2010|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative values of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions calculated with the WTW or with the LCA method can differ, since the LCA is considering more emission sources. In example, while assessing the GHG emissions of a [[Battery Electric Vehicle]] in comparison with a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle, the WTW (accounting only the GHG for manufacturing the fuels) finds out that an electric vehicle can save the 50-60% of GHG &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Lonza L|title=Electricity carbon intensity in European Member States: Impacts on GHG emissions of electric vehicles | journal=Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment | doi=10.1016/j.trd.2017.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while an hybrid LCA-WTW method, considering also the GHG due to the manufacturing and the end of life of the battery gives GHG emission savings 10-13% lower, compared to the WTW. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Helmers E|title=A new hybrid method for reducing the gap between WTW and LCA in the carbon footprint assessment of electric vehicles|journal=Int J Life Cycle Assess (2017) 22: 4.|doi=10.1007/s11367-015-0954-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic input–output life cycle assessment===

Economic input–output LCA ([[EIOLCA]]) involves use of aggregate sector-level data on how much environmental impact can be attributed to each sector of the economy and how much each sector purchases from other sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, C. T., Lave, L. B., and Matthews, H. S. (2005). ''Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Goods and Services: An Input–Output Approach'', Resources for the Future Press {{ISBN|1-933115-24-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such analysis can account for long chains (for example, building an automobile requires energy, but producing energy requires vehicles, and building those vehicles requires energy, etc.), which somewhat alleviates the scoping problem of process LCA; however, EIOLCA relies on sector-level averages that may or may not be representative of the specific subset of the sector relevant to a particular product and therefore is not suitable for evaluating the environmental impacts of products. Additionally the translation of economic quantities into environmental impacts is not validated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiolca.net/Method/Limitations.html Limitations of the EIO-LCA Method and Models]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecologically based LCA===

While a conventional LCA uses many of the same approaches and strategies as an Eco-LCA, the latter considers a much broader range of ecological impacts. It was designed to provide a guide to wise management of human activities by understanding the direct and indirect impacts on ecological resources and surrounding ecosystems. Developed by Ohio State University Center for resilience, Eco-LCA is a methodology that quantitatively takes into account regulating and supporting services during the life cycle of economic goods and products. In this approach services are categorized in four main groups: supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural services.&lt;ref name=Singh&amp;baksshi&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Singh |author2=B. R. Bakshi |title=Eco-LCA: A Tool for Quantifying the Role of Ecological Resources in LCA|doi=10.1109/ISSST.2009.5156770 |journal= International Symposium on Sustainable Systems and Technology|year= 2009|pages=1–6|isbn=978-1-4244-4324-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exergy based LCA ==
[[Exergy]] of a system is the maximum useful work possible during a process that brings the system into equilibrium with a heat reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, M. A., &amp; Dincer, I. (2001). Exergy as the confluence of energy, environment and sustainable development.

(2003). Exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS) for the assessment of resource productivity of transport commodities.

concept of material input per unit of service (MIPS) is quantified in terms of the second law of thermodynamics, allowing the calculation of both resource input and service output in exergy terms. This exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS) has been elaborated for transport technology. The service not only takes into account the total mass to be transported
and the total distance, but also the mass per single transport and the delivery time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Life cycle energy analysis==

Life cycle energy analysis (LCEA) is an approach in which all [[energy]] inputs to a product are accounted for, not only direct energy inputs during manufacture, but also all energy inputs needed to produce components, materials and services needed for the manufacturing process. An earlier term for the approach was ''energy analysis''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

With LCEA, the ''total life cycle energy input'' is established.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Energy production===
{{see|energy production}}
It is recognized that much energy is lost in the production of energy commodities themselves, such as [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], [[photovoltaic]]
[[electricity]] or high-quality [[petroleum products]]. ''Net energy content'' is the energy content of the product minus energy input used
during extraction and [[energy conversion|conversion]], directly or indirectly. A controversial early result of LCEA claimed that manufacturing
[[solar cell]]s requires more energy than can be recovered in using the solar cell {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. The result was refuted.&lt;ref&gt;David MacKay [http://www.withouthotair.com/ Sustainable Energy] 24 February 2010 p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;
Another new concept that flows from life cycle assessments is [[Energy Cannibalism]]. Energy Cannibalism refers to an effect where rapid
growth of an entire energy-intensive industry creates a need for [[energy]] that uses (or cannibalizes) the energy of existing power
plants. Thus during rapid growth the industry as a whole produces no energy because new energy is used to fuel the [[embodied energy]] of
future power plants. Work has been undertaken in the UK to determine the life cycle energy (alongside full LCA) impacts of a number of renewable technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McManus, M |title=Life cycle impacts of waste wood biomass heating systems: A case study of three UK based systems|journal= Energy |volume =35|issue =10|year=2010|pages =4064–4070|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2010.06.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Allen, S.R., G.P. Hammond, H. Harajli, C.I. Jones, M.C. McManus and A.B. Winnett|year= 2008|title=Integrated appraisal of micro-generators: methods and applications|journal=|volume=161 |issue=2|pages=73–86|doi=10.1680/ener.2008.161.2.73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy recovery===
{{see|energy recovery}}
If materials are incinerated during the disposal process, the energy released during burning can be harnessed and used for [[electricity production]]. This provides a low-impact energy source, especially when compared with [[coal]] and natural gas&lt;ref&gt;Damgaard, A, et al. ''Life-cycle-assessment of the historical development of air pollution control and energy recovery in waste incineration.'' Waste Management 30 (2010) 1244–1250.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[incineration]] produces more [[greenhouse gas]] emissions than [[landfilling]], the waste plants are well-fitted with filters to minimize this negative impact. A recent study comparing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from landfilling (without energy recovery) against incineration (with energy recovery) found incineration to be superior in all cases except for when [[landfill gas]] is recovered for electricity production.&lt;ref&gt;Liamsanguan, C., Gheewala, S.H., ''LCA: A decision support tool for environmental assessment of MSW management systems.'' Jour. of Environ. Mgmt. 87 (2009) 132–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
It has also been argued that energy efficiency is only one consideration in deciding which alternative process to employ, and that it should not be elevated to the only criterion for determining environmental acceptability.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} For example, simple energy analysis does not take into account the renewability of energy flows or the toxicity of waste products;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hammond | first = Geoffrey P. | title = Engineering sustainability: thermodynamics, energy systems, and the environment | journal = [[International Journal of Energy Research]] | volume = 28 | issue = 7 | pages = 613–639 | year = 2004 | url = http://www.etcs.ipfw.edu/~mueller/me427/Engineering_sustainability.pdf| doi = 10.1002/er.988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Incorporating '''Dynamic LCAs''' of renewable energy technologies (using sensitivity analyses to project future improvements in renewable systems and their share of the power grid) may help mitigate this criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pehnt | first = Martin | title = Dynamic life cycle assessment (LCA) of renewable energy technologies | journal = Renewable Energy: an International Journal | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–71 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.renene.2005.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the literature on life cycle assessment of [[energy technology]] has begun to reflect the interactions between the current [[electrical grid]] and future [[energy technology]]. Some papers have focused on [[energy]] life cycle,&lt;ref name="Pearce2"&gt;J.M. Pearce, [http://me.queensu.ca/people/pearce/publications/documents/asp3.pdf "Optimizing Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Strategies to Suppress Energy Cannibalism"] 2nd Climate Change Technology Conference Proceedings, p. 48, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Joshua M. Pearce|doi=10.1504/IJNGEE.2008.017358|title=Thermodynamic limitations to nuclear energy deployment as a greenhouse gas mitigation technology|journal=International Journal of Nuclear Governance, Economy and Ecology |volume=2|issue=1|year=2008|pages=113–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dynamic"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jyotirmay Mathur |author2=Narendra Kumar Bansal |author3=Hermann-Joseph Wagner |doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(02)00290-2|title=Dynamic energy analysis to assess maximum growth rates in developing power generation capacity: case study of India|journal=Energy Policy |volume=32|issue=2|year=2004|pages=281–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have focused on [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and other [[greenhouse gases]].&lt;ref name="RKCL"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=R. Kenny |author2=C. Law |author3=J.M. Pearce |title=Towards Real Energy Economics: Energy Policy Driven by Life-Cycle Carbon Emission|journal=Energy Policy |volume=38|pages=1969–1978|year=2010|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2009.11.078|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essential critique given by these sources is that when considering [[energy technology]], the growing nature of the power grid must be taken into consideration. If this is not done, a given class of [[energy technology]] may emit more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over its lifetime than it mitigates.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A problem the energy analysis method cannot resolve is that different energy forms ([[heat]], [[electricity]], [[chemical energy]] etc.) have different quality and value even in natural sciences, as a consequence of the two main laws of [[thermodynamics]]. A thermodynamic measure of the quality of energy is [[exergy]]. According to the [[first law of thermodynamics]], all energy inputs should be accounted with equal weight, whereas by the [[second law of thermodynamics|second law]] diverse energy forms should be accounted by different values.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The conflict is resolved in one of these ways:
* value difference between energy inputs is ignored,
* a value ratio is arbitrarily assigned (e.g., a [[joule]] of [[electricity]] is 2.6 times more valuable than a joule of heat or fuel input),
* the analysis is supplemented by economic (monetary) cost analysis,
* [[exergy]] instead of energy can be the metric used for the life cycle analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cornelissen | first = Reinerus Louwrentius | title = Thermodynamics and sustainable development; the use of exergy analysis and the reduction of irreversibility | year = 1997|work=Thesis, University of Twente, Netherlands | url = http://doc.utwente.nl/32030/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==

Life cycle assessment is a powerful tool for analyzing [[wikt:commensurable|commensurable]] aspects of quantifiable systems. Not every factor, however, can be reduced to a number and inserted into a model. Rigid system boundaries make accounting for changes in the system difficult. This is sometimes referred to as the [[boundary critique]] to [[systems thinking]]. The accuracy and availability of data can also contribute to inaccuracy. For instance, data from generic processes may be based on [[average]]s, [[Sampling error|unrepresentative sampling]], or outdated results.&lt;ref&gt;Malin, Nadav, [http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/2002/3/1/Life-Cycle-Assessment-for-Buildings-Seeking-the-Holy-Grail/?&amp;printable=yes Life-cycle assessment for buildings: Seeking the Holy Grail.] Building Green, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, social implications of products are generally lacking in LCAs. Comparative life-cycle analysis is often used to determine a better process or product to use. However, because of aspects like differing system boundaries, different statistical information, different product uses, etc., these studies can easily be swayed in favor of one product or process over another in one study and the opposite in another study based on varying parameters and different available data.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Gaines and Frank Stodolsky [http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/TA/104.pdf Life-Cycle Analysis: Uses and Pitfalls]. Argonne National Laboratory. Transportation Technology R&amp;D Center&lt;/ref&gt; There are guidelines to help reduce such conflicts in results but the method still provides a lot of room for the researcher to decide what is important, how the product is typically manufactured, and how it is typically used.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Streamline LCA===

This process includes three steps.
First, a proper method should be selected to combine adequate accuracy with acceptable cost burden in order to guide decision making. Actually, in LCA process, besides streamline LCA, Eco-screening and complete LCA are usually considered as well. However, the former one only could provide limited details and the latter one with more detailed information is more expensive.
Second, single measure of stress should be selected. Typical LCA output includes [[resource consumption]], energy consumption, water consumption, emission of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], toxic residues and so on. One of these outputs is used as the main factor to measure in streamline LCA. Energy consumption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission are often regarded as “practical indicators”.
Last, stress selected in step 2 is used as standard to assess phase of life separately and identify the most damaging phase. For instance, for a family car, energy consumption could be used as the single stress factor to assess each phase of life. The result shows that the most energy intensive phase for a family car is the usage stage.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1162">In mathematics, a '''Listing number''' of a [[topological space]] is one of several [[topological invariant]]s introduced by the 19th-century mathematician [[Johann Benedict Listing]] and later given this name by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Unlike the later invariants given by [[Bernhard Riemann]], the Listing numbers do not form a complete set of invariants: two different two-dimensional [[manifold]]s may have the same Listing numbers as each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Reasoning and the Logic of Things: The Cambridge Conferences Lectures of 1898|first=Charles Sanders|last=Peirce|authorlink=Charles Sanders Peirce|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=1992|isbn=9780674749672|at=Footnote 70, pp. 279–280|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWfRF5BAcG0C&amp;pg=PA279}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four Listing numbers associated with a space.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, pp.&amp;nbsp;99–102.&lt;/ref&gt;  The smallest Listing number counts the number of connected components of a space, and is thus equivalent to the zeroth [[Betti number]].&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, p.&amp;nbsp;99.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3817">The '''Massachusetts Body of Liberties''' was the first legal code established by European colonists in [[New England]]. Compiled by the [[Puritan]] minister [[Nathaniel Ward]], the laws were established by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1641. The Body of Liberties begins by establishing the exclusive right of the General Court to legislate and dictate the "Countenance of Authority".

In 1684 [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] revoked the Body of Liberties and reinstated English law over the Commonwealth. When [[James II of England|King James II]] established the [[Massachusetts Colony]] the Body of Liberties took effect{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and remained so until it was replaced by the 1691 [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Provincial Charter]].&lt;ref name="EACL"&gt;Encyclopedia of American civil liberties, Volume 1, Ed. Paul Finkelman, entry written by Sherrow Pinder, CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-94342-6}}, page 979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights acknowledged by the Body of Liberties==
The Body of Liberties was one of the earliest protections of [[individual rights]] in America.&lt;ref name="Bernard"&gt;Bernard Schwartz, ''The great rights of mankind: a history of the American Bill of Rights'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1992, 0945612281, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many of the English sources of the time, the Body of Liberties were express in many of their grants and far more supportive of individual rights.&lt;ref name="Bernard" /&gt; Despite these grants, the rights were modifiable by the General Court.

To varying degrees, the document contained rights that would later be included in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. Many of the other rights are now considered fundamental components of [[procedural due process]], such as rights to notice and hearing before the court. The rights also contained in the Bill of Rights included [[freedom of speech]], a right against [[Takings clause|uncompensated takings]], a [[Bail#United States|right to bail]], a [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|right to jury trial]], a [[Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause|right against cruel and unusual punishment]], and a right against [[double jeopardy]].&lt;ref name="Bernard" /&gt;

In addition to those, the Body of Liberties also contained other individual rights, including: a prohibition of a compulsory [[conscription|draft]] except for territorial defense; a prohibition of [[monopolies]], "No monopolies shall be granted or allowed amongst us, but of such new Inventions that are profitable to the Countrie, and that for a short time."; &lt;!-- The quote is from the original, do not change the spelling to modern spelling --&gt;prohibition of an [[estate tax]]; the freedom of all "house holders" to fishing and fowling on public land.

Some of the liberties legislated are explicitly cited as originating from biblical sources. While many of the liberties established still exist in both and law and practice in the Commonwealth today, some do not. The justification for slavery of Africans in Passage 91 of the Body of Liberties was likely based on an interpretation of scriptural passages of the [[New Testament]], such as Ephesians 6:5 and Titus 2:9. Liberties were only extended to Caucasian Northern Europeans, particularly [[protestant Christian]] men.

'''Meditation''' is a practice where an individual uses a technique - such as mindfulness, or focusing their mind on a particular object, thought or activity - to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm state.&lt;ref name=walsh06/&gt;{{rp|228–9}}&lt;ref name=cahn06/&gt;{{rp|180}}&lt;ref name=jevning92/&gt;{{rp|415}}&lt;ref name=goleman88/&gt;{{rp|107}}&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt;

Meditation has been practiced since [[history of meditation|antiquity]] in numerous religious traditions and beliefs. Since the 19th century, it has spread from its origins to other cultures where it is commonly practiced in private and business life.

Meditation may be used with the aim of reducing stress, anxiety, depression, and pain, and increasing peace, perception,&lt;ref&gt;[https://hackspirit.com/dalai-lama-reveals-practice-meditation-properly/ For the 14th Dalai Lama the aim of meditation is "''to maintain a very full state of alertness and mindfulness, and then try to see the natural state of your consciousness.''"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[self-concept]], and [[well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation/overview.htm|title=Meditation: In Depth|website=NCCIH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goyal"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4142584|year=2014|author1=Goyal|first1=M|title=Meditation Programs for Psychological Stress and Well-being: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=174|issue=3|pages=357–368|last2=Singh|first2=S|last3=Sibinga|first3=E.

==Etymology==
The English ''meditation'' is derived from the [[Latin languages|Latin]] ''[[:wikt:meditatio|meditatio]]'', from a verb ''[[:wikt:meditor|meditari]]'', meaning "to think, contemplate, devise, ponder".&lt;ref&gt;''An universal etymological English dictionary'' 1773, London, by Nathan Bailey {{ISBN|1-00-237787-0}}. Note: from the 1773 edition on Google books, not earlier editions.{{Clarify|date=May 2011}}&lt;!--why on earth would you cite a 1773 dictionary to establish a straightforward Latin loan??--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Old Testament]], ''hāgâ'' (Hebrew: ''הגה'') means to sigh or murmur, and also, to meditate.&lt;ref&gt;Terje Stordalen, "Ancient Hebrew Meditative Recitation", in Halvor Eifring (ed.), ''Meditation in Judaism, Christianity and Islam: Cultural Histories'', 2013, {{ISBN|978-1441122148}} pages 17-31&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Hebrew Bible]] was translated into Greek, ''hāgâ'' became the Greek ''melete''. The Latin Bible then translated ''hāgâ''/''melete'' into ''meditatio''.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition'' by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996 {{ISBN|0-8091-3660-0}} page 88&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of the term ''meditatio'' as part of a formal, stepwise process of meditation goes back to the 12th-century monk [[Guigo II]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oblate Life'' by Gervase Holdaway, 2008 {{ISBN|0-8146-3176-2}} page 115&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition within specific contexts more precise meanings are not uncommonly given the word "meditation".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--- UNCLEAR IF EXAMPLES ARE NEEDED... ERRING ON THE SIDE OF INCLUSION... ---&gt;Besides Lectio and Yoga, examples include [[Herbert Benson]]'s (1975) ''Relaxation Response'' {{ISBN|0-380-00676-6}}, [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]]'s (1990) ''Full Catastrophe Living'' {{ISBN|0-385-29897-8}}, and [[Eknath Easwaran]]'s (1978) ''[[Passage Meditation]]'' {{ISBN|978-1-58638-026-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "meditation" is sometimes the translation of ''meditatio'' in Latin. ''Meditatio'' is the second of four steps of ''[[Lectio Divina]]'', an ancient form of Christian prayer. "Meditation" also refers to the seventh of the eight limbs of [[Yoga]] in [[Patanjali]]'s ''[[Yoga Sutras]]'', a step called ''dhyāna'' in Sanskrit. Meditation refers to a mental or spiritual ''state'' that may be attained by such practices,&lt;ref name=feurstein06/&gt; and also refers to the ''practice'' of that state.

Apart from its historical usage, the term ''meditation'' was introduced as a translation for Eastern spiritual practices, referred to as ''dhyāna'' [[Dhyana in Hinduism|in Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] and  which comes from the [[Sanskrit]] root ''dhyai'', meaning to contemplate or meditate.&lt;ref name=feurstein06&gt;[[Georg Feuerstein|Feuerstein, Georg]].

==Definitions==

In popular usage, the word "meditation" and the phrase "meditative practice" are often used imprecisely to designate broadly similar practices, or sets of practices, that are found across many cultures and traditions.&lt;ref name=goleman88/&gt;&lt;ref name=carroll05&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Mary Carroll |year=2005 |title=Divine therapy: Teaching reflective and meditative practices |journal=Teaching Theology and Religion |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=232–238 |url=|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9647.2005.00249.x |pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions in the Oxford and Cambridge living dictionaries and Merriam-Webster include both the original Latin meaning of "think[ing] deeply about (something),"&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; as the popular usage of "to focus one's mind for a period of time,"&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/meditate|title=meditate - Definition of meditate in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the act of giving your attention to only one thing,"&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/meditation|title=meditation Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "to engage in mental exercise (such as concentration on one's breathing or repetition of a mantra) for the purpose of reaching a heightened level of spiritual awareness."&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meditate|title=Definition of meditate|publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|language=en|date=18 December 2017|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is considered meditation can include almost any practice that trains the attention or teaches calm or compassion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brainimaging.waisman.wisc.edu/~lutz/Meditation_Neuroscience_2005_AL_JDD_RJD_2.pdf|title=Lutz A., Dunne J.D., Davidson R.J.

Bond et al. (2009), based on views common to seven experts trained in diverse but empirically highly studied (clinical or Eastern-derived,&lt;!---cite review noting almost all research has examined eastern-derived or clinical practices---&gt;) forms of meditation,&lt;ref&gt;"members were chosen on the basis of their publication record of research on the therapeutic use of meditation, their knowledge of and training in traditional or clinically developed meditation techniques, and their affiliation with universities and research centers.. Each member had specific expertise and training in at least one of the following meditation practices: [[kundalini yoga]], [[Transcendental Meditation]], relaxation response, [[mindfulness-based stress reduction]], and [[vipassana]] meditation" (Bond, Ospina et al., 2009, p. 131); their views were combined using "the [[Delphi method|Delphi technique]]... a method of eliciting and refining group judgments to address complex problems with a high level of uncertainty" (p. 131).&lt;/ref&gt; identified

The practitioner of meditation attempts to get beyond the reflexive, "thinking" mind&lt;ref name=oknondiscursive&gt;This does not mean that all meditation seeks to take a person beyond ''all'' thought processes, only those processes that are sometimes referred to as "discursive" or "logical" (see Shapiro, 1982/1984; Bond, Ospina, et al., 2009; Appendix B, pp. 279-282 in Ospina, Bond, et al., 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes called "discursive thinking"&lt;ref name=shapiro82discursive&gt;An influential definition by Shapiro (1982) states that "''meditation refers to a family of techniques which have in common a conscious attempt to focus attention in a nonanalytical way and an attempt not to dwell on discursive, ruminating thought''" (p. 6, italics in original); the term "discursive thought" has long been used in Western philosophy, and is often viewed as a synonym to logical thought ({{cite book |title=Reading neoplatonism : Non-discursive thinking in the texts of plotinus, proclus, and damascius

(2009)&amp;nbsp;– see fuller discussion elsewhere on this page -- report that 7 expert scholars who had studied different traditions of meditation agreed that an "essential" component of meditation "Involves logic relaxation: not 'to intend' to analyze the possible psychophysical effects, not 'to intend' to judge the possible results, not 'to intend' to create any type of expectation regarding the process" (p. 134, Table 4). In their final consideration, all 7 experts regarded this feature as an "essential" component of meditation; none of them regarded it as merely "important but not essential" (p. 234, Table 4). (This same result is presented in Table B1 in Ospina, Bond, et al., 2007, p. 281)&lt;/ref&gt;) This may be to achieve a deeper, more devout, or more relaxed state. In this article the terms "meditative practice" and "meditation" are mostly used in this broad sense. However, in some contexts more specialized meanings of "meditation" may be intended.

===Separation of technique from tradition===
Some of the difficulty in precisely defining meditation has been the difficulty in recognizing the particularities of the many various traditions.&lt;ref name="intro to consciousness" /&gt; There may be differences between the theories of one tradition of meditation as to what it means to practice meditation.&lt;ref name="Dunne @ Stanford"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Dunne's speech |url=http://ccare.stanford.edu/node/21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120171057/http://ccare.stanford.edu/node/21 |archivedate=November 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences between the various traditions themselves, which have grown up a great distance apart from each other, may be even starker.&lt;ref name="Dunne @ Stanford"/&gt; Taylor noted that to refer only to meditation from a particular faith (e.g., "Hindu" or "Buddhist")

{{quote|''...is not enough, since the cultural traditions from which a particular kind of meditation comes are quite different and even within a single tradition differ in complex ways. The specific name of a school of thought or a teacher or the title of a specific text is often quite important for identifying a particular type of meditation.''&lt;ref name=taylor99/&gt;{{rp|2}}
}}

Ornstein noted that ''"Most techniques of meditation do not exist as solitary practices but are only artificially separable from an entire system of practice and belief."''&lt;ref name=ornstein72&gt;Robert Ornstein (1972, originally published 1971), in: Naranjo and Orenstein, ''On the Psychology of Meditation''. New York: Viking. LCCN 76149720&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|143}} This means that, for instance, while monks engage in meditation as a part of their everyday lives, they also engage the codified rules and live together in monasteries in specific cultural settings that go along with their meditative practices. These meditative practices sometimes have similarities (often noticed by Westerners), for instance concentration on the breath is practiced in Zen, Tibetan and Theravadan contexts, and these similarities or "typologies" are noted here.

==Forms of meditation==

===Focused vs open monitoring meditation===
In the West, meditation techniques have sometimes been thought of in two broad categories: focused (or concentrative) meditation and open monitoring (or [[mindfulness]]) meditation.&lt;ref name=lutz08/&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''One style, Focused Attention (FA) meditation, entails the voluntary focusing of attention on a chosen object, breathing, image, or words. The other style, Open Monitoring (OM) meditation, involves non-reactive monitoring of the content of experience from moment to moment.''&lt;ref name=lutz08&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lutz |first1=Antoine |last2=Slagter |first2=Heleen A. |last3=Dunne |first3=John D. |last4=Davidson |first4=Richard J. |title=Attention regulation and monitoring in meditation |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |date=April 2008 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=163–169 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.01.005 |pmid=18329323 |pmc=2693206 |quote=The term ‘meditation’ refers to a broad variety of practices...In order to narrow the explanandum to a more tractable scope, this article uses Buddhist contemplative techniques and their clinical secular derivatives as a paradigmatic framework (see e.g., 9,10 or 7,9 for reviews including other types of techniques, such as Yoga and Transcendental Meditation). Among the wide range of practices within the Buddhist tradition, we will further narrow this review to two common styles of meditation, FA and OM (see box 1–box 2), that are often combined, whether in a single session or over the course of practitioner's training. These styles are found with some variation in several meditation traditions, including Zen, Vipassanā and Tibetan Buddhism (e.g. 7,15,16)....The first style, FA meditation, entails voluntary focusing attention on a chosen object in a sustained fashion. The second style, OM meditation, involves non-reactively monitoring the content of experience from moment to moment, primarily as a means to recognize the nature of emotional and cognitive patterns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''Direction of mental attention... A practitioner can focus intensively on one particular object (so-called ''concentrative meditation''), on all mental events that enter the field of awareness (so-called ''mindfulness meditation''), or both specific focal points and the field of awareness.''&lt;ref name=bond09/&gt;{{rp|130}}&lt;ref&gt;The full quote from Bond, Ospina et al. (2009, p. 130) reads: "The differences and similarities among these techniques is often explained in the Western meditation literature in terms of the direction of mental attention (Koshikawa &amp; Ichii, 1996; Naranjo, 1971; Orenstein, 1971): A practitioner can focus intensively on one particular object (so-called ''concentrative meditation''), on all mental events that enter the field of awareness (so-called ''mindfulness meditation''), or both specific focal points and the field of awareness (Orenstein, 1971)."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Focused attention methods====
These include [[Anapanasati|paying attention to the breath]], to an idea or feeling (such as [[Mettā|mettā (loving-kindness)]]), or to a [[mantra]] (such as in [[Transcendental Meditation|transcendental meditation]]), and single point meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bcnJAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bhagavad+gita#v=snippet&amp;q=pointedness&amp;f=false|title=The Bhagavad Gita: (Classics of Indian Spirituality)|first=Eknath|last=Easwaran|date=10 September 2018|publisher=Nilgiri Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9781586380199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Single-pointed concentration ([[samadhi]]) is a meditative power that is useful in either of these two types of meditation. However, in order to develop samadhi itself we must cultivate principally concentration meditation. In terms of practice, this means that we must choose an object of concentration and then meditate single-pointedly on it every day until the power of samadhi is attained." {{cite web|url=https://www.lamayeshe.com/article/developing-single-pointed-concentration|title=Developing Single-pointed Concentration|first=|last=lywa|date=2 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Open monitoring methods====
These include [[mindfulness]],  [[shikantaza]] and other awareness states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meditation-research.org.uk/2013/07/advanced-tibetan-buddhist-meditation-practice-raises-body-temperature-part-2/|title=Site is under maintenance|website=meditation-research.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No thought===
In these methods, "''the practitioner is fully alert, aware, and in control of their faculties but does not experience any unwanted thought activity.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2012/350674/|title=Quality of Life and Functional Health Status of Long-Term Meditators|first1=Ramesh|last1=Manocha|first2=Deborah|last2=Black|first3=Leigh|last3=Wilson|date=10 September 2018|journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|volume=2012|pages=1–9|doi=10.1155/2012/350674|pmid=22611427|pmc=3352577}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to the common meditative approaches of being detached from, and non-judgmental of, thoughts, but not of aiming for thoughts to cease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmaseed.org/teacher/387/ "''There might be a depth of meditation where thinking ceases. This is a refined, refreshing and nourishing state of consciousness. But it is not the goal.''" Kirsten Kratz, "Calm and kindness" talk, Gaia House, 03/2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Sahaja Yoga#Sahaja meditation and associated research|meditation practice of the Sahaja yoga spiritual movement]], the focus is on thoughts ceasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sahajayogaarmenia.wordpress.com/meditation-armenia/|title=Meditation|date=21 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luminosity (Vajrayana)|Clear light yoga]] also aims at a state of no mental content, as does the no thought (wu nian) state taught by [[Huineng#No-thought and meditation|Huineng]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/huineng/#SSH4aiii|title=Huineng (Hui-neng) (638—713)|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=2018|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the teaching of [[Yaoshan Weiyan]].

===Automatic self-transcending===
One proposal is that [[transcendental meditation]] and possibly other techniques be grouped as an 'automatic self-transcending' set of techniques.&lt;ref name="Travis, F. 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Fred Travis|author2=Jonathan Shear|year=2010|title=Focused attention, open monitoring and automatic self-transcending: Categories to organize meditations from Vedic, Buddhist and Chinese traditions|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=19|issue=4|pages=1110–8|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.01.007|pmid=20167507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other typologies===
Other typologies include dividing meditation into concentrative, generative, receptive and reflective practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/customs/meditation_1.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Buddhism: Meditation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meditation practice==

===Common practice timings===
The [[transcendental meditation technique]] recommends practice of 20 minutes twice per day.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/business-meditation-executives-meditate_n_3528731|title=The Daily Habit Of These Outrageously Successful People|date=5 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some techniques suggest less time,&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt; especially when starting meditation,&lt;ref&gt;[[Mindfulness#Meditation method]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Davidson|Richie Davidson]] has quoted research saying benefits can be achieved with a practice of only 8 minutes per day.&lt;ref name="abcnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Health/neuroscientist-richie-davidson-dalai-lama-gave-total-wake/story?id=40859233|title=Neuroscientist Says Dalai Lama Gave Him 'a Total Wake-Up Call'|first=A.

Whilst positions such as the [[Lotus position|full-lotus]], half-lotus, [[Cross-legged|Burmese]], [[Seiza]], and [[kneeling]] positions are popular in Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, other postures such as sitting, supine (lying), and standing are also used. Meditation is also sometimes done while walking, known as [[kinhin]], or while doing a simple task mindfully, known as [[Samu (Zen)|samu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ng |first1=Teng-Kuan |title=Pedestrian Dharma: Slowness and Seeing in Tsai Ming-Liang's Walker |journal=Religions |date=2018 |volume=9 |issue=7 |page=200 |doi=10.3390/rel9070200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of prayer beads===
Some ancient religions of the world have a tradition of using [[prayer beads]] as tools in devotional meditation.&lt;ref name=Binz3 &gt;''Mysteries of the Rosary'' by Stephen J. Binz 2005 {{ISBN|1-58595-519-1}} page 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sach &gt;''The everything Buddhism book'' by Jacky Sach 2003 {{ISBN|978-1-58062-884-6}} page 175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a general overview see ''Beads of Faith: Pathways to Meditation and Spirituality Using Rosaries, Prayer Beads, and Sacred Words'' by Gray Henry, Susannah Marriott 2008 {{ISBN|1-887752-95-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most prayer beads and Christian [[Rosary based prayers|rosaries]] consist of pearls or beads linked together by a thread.&lt;ref name=Binz3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sach /&gt; The [[Rosary|Roman Catholic rosary]] is a string of beads containing five sets with ten small beads. The Hindu [[japa mala]] has 108 beads (the figure 108 in itself having spiritual significance, as well as those used in [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhist prayer beads]].&lt;ref name=Vishnu &gt;''Meditation and Mantras'' by Vishnu Devananda 1999 {{ISBN|81-208-1615-3}} pages 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Each bead is counted once as a person recites a [[mantra]] until the person has gone all the way around the mala.&lt;ref name=Vishnu /&gt; The Muslim [[misbaha]] has 99 beads.

===Possible benefits of supporting meditation practice with a narrative===
[[Richard Davidson|Richie Davidson]] has expressed the view that having a narrative can help maintenance of daily practice.&lt;ref name="abcnews1"/&gt; For instance he himself [[Prostration (Buddhism)|prostrates]] to the teachings, and meditates "not primarily for my benefit, but for the benefit of others."&lt;ref name="abcnews1"/&gt;

==Religious and spiritual meditation==

===Indian religions===

====Jainism====
{{Main|Jain meditation}}
[[File:Mahaveer swami.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mahavira]] in meditative posture]]
In [[Jainism]], meditation has been a core spiritual practice, one that Jains believe people have undertaken since the teaching of the [[Tirthankara]], [[Rishabha (Jain tirthankar)|Rishabha]].&lt;ref name="Acharya Tulsi"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Acharya Tulsi Key |title=Bhagwan Mahavira |publisher=JVB, Ladnun, India |year=1995 |chapter=01.01 Traditions of shramanas |url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=66251 |accessdate=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the twenty-four Tirthankaras practiced deep meditation and attained enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Jainism"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Sadhvi Vishrut Vibha Key |title=Introduction to Jainism |publisher=JVB, Ladnun, India |year=2007 |chapter=1 History and Tradition}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are all shown in meditative postures in the images or idols.

Jain meditation and spiritual practices system were referred to as salvation-path. It has three important parts called the ''[[Ratnatraya]]'' "Three Jewels": right perception and faith, right knowledge and right conduct.&lt;ref name="Ratna traya"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Acharya Mahapragya |title=Jain Yog |publisher=Aadarsh Saahitya Sangh |chapter=Foreword |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meditation in Jainism aims at realizing the self, attaining salvation, take the soul to complete freedom.&lt;ref name="blessings"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Acharya Tulsi |title=Sambodhi |publisher=Aadarsh Saahitya Sangh |chapter=blessings |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to reach and to remain in the pure state of soul which is believed to be pure consciousness, beyond any attachment or aversion. The practitioner strives to be just a knower-seer (Gyata-Drashta). Jain meditation can be broadly categorized to ''Dharmya Dhyana'' and ''Shukla Dhyana''.

There exists a number of meditation techniques such as ''pindāstha-dhyāna, padāstha-dhyāna, rūpāstha-dhyāna, rūpātita-dhyāna, savīrya-dhyāna'', etc. In ''padāstha dhyāna'' one focuses on [[Mantra]].&lt;ref name="HN4U"/&gt; A Mantra could be either a combination of core letters or words on deity or themes. There is a rich tradition of Mantra in Jainism. All Jain followers irrespective of their sect, whether [[Digambar]]a or [[Svetambara]], practice mantra. Mantra chanting is an important part of daily lives of Jain monks and followers. Mantra chanting can be done either loudly or silently in mind. [[Yogasana]] and ''Pranayama'' has been an important practice undertaken since ages. Pranayama&amp;nbsp;– breathing exercises&amp;nbsp;– are performed to strengthen the five ''Pranas'' or vital energy.&lt;ref name="yoga"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dr. Rudi Jansma |author2=Dr. Sneh Rani Jain Key |title=Introduction To Jainism |publisher=Prakrit Bharti Academy, jaipur, India |year=2006 |chapter=07 Yoga and Meditation (2) |url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=66251 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yogasana and ''Pranayama'' balances the functioning of neuro-endocrine system of body and helps in achieving good physical, mental and emotional health.&lt;ref name="yogic kriya"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Muni Kishan Lal Key |title=Preksha Dhyana: Yogic Exercises |publisher=Jain Vishva Bharati |year=2007 |url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=71578 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemplation is a very old and important meditation technique. The practitioner meditates deeply on subtle facts. In ''agnya vichāya'', one contemplates on seven facts&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; life and non-life, the inflow, bondage, stoppage and removal of ''karmas'', and the final accomplishment of liberation. In ''apaya vichāya'', one contemplates on the incorrect insights one indulges, which eventually develops right insight. In ''vipaka vichāya'', one reflects on the eight causes or basic types of ''karma''. In ''sansathan vichāya'', one thinks about the vastness of the universe and the loneliness of the soul.&lt;ref name="HN4U"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dr. Rudi Jansma |author2=Dr. Sneh Rani Jain Key |title=Introduction To Jainism |publisher=Prakrit Bharti Academy, jaipur, India |year=2006 |chapter=07 Yoga and Meditation (2) |url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=66251 |accessdate=2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acharya [[Mahapragya]] formulated [[Preksha meditation]] in the 1970s and presented a well-organised system of meditation. [[Asana]] and ''Pranayama'', meditation, contemplation, mantra and therapy are its integral parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preksha.com/ |title=Preksha Meditation |publisher=Preksha International |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous Preksha meditation centers came into existence around the world and numerous meditations camps are being organized to impart training in it.

====Buddhism====
{{Main|Buddhist meditation}}
[[File:BodhidharmaYoshitoshi1887.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bodhidharma]] practicing [[zazen]].]]
Buddhist meditation refers to the meditative practices associated with the religion and philosophy of [[Buddhism]]. Core meditation techniques have been preserved in ancient [[Buddhist texts]] and have proliferated and diversified through teacher-student transmissions. [[Buddhism|Buddhist]]s pursue meditation as part of the path toward [[Bodhi|awakening]] and [[nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Kamalashila (2003), p. 4, states that Buddhist meditation "includes any method of meditation that has [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]] as its ''ultimate'' aim." Likewise, Bodhi (1999) writes: "To arrive at the experiential realization of the truths it is necessary to take up the practice of meditation.... At the climax of such contemplation the mental eye ... shifts its focus to the unconditioned state, [[Nirvana|Nibbana]]...." A similar although in some ways slightly broader definition is provided by Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 142: "'''Meditation'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; general term for a multitude of religious practices, often quite different in method, but all having the same goal: to bring the consciousness of the practitioner to a state in which he can come to an experience of 'awakening,' 'liberation,' 'enlightenment.'" Kamalashila (2003) further allows that some Buddhist meditations are "of a more preparatory nature" (p. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are ''[[Bhavana|bhāvanā]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The [[Pāli]] and [[Sanskrit]] word ''bhāvanā'' literally means "development" as in "mental development." For the association of this term with "meditation," see Epstein (1995), p. 105; and, Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 20. As an example from a well-known discourse of the [[Pali Canon]], in "The Greater Exhortation to Rahula" (''Maha-Rahulovada Sutta'', [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 62), Ven. [[Sariputta]] tells Ven. [[Rahula]] (in Pali, based on [http://www.tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/s0202m.mul1.xml VRI, n.d.)]: ''{{IAST|ānāpānassatiṃ, rāhula, bhāvanaṃ bhāvehi.}}'' [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html Thanissaro (2006)] translates this as: "Rahula, develop the meditation [''{{IAST|bhāvana}}''] of [[anapanasati|mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing]]." (Square-bracketed Pali word included based on Thanissaro, 2006, end note.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''jhāna''/''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]'',&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:2005.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), entry for "jhāna&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;"]{{dead link|date=June 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}; [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/onetool.html Thanissaro (1997)]; as well as, Kapleau (1989), p.&amp;nbsp;385, for the derivation of the word "zen" from [[Sanskrit]] "dhyāna". [[Pāli Text Society]] Secretary Rupert Gethin, in describing the activities of [[Sramana|wandering ascetics]] contemporaneous with the Buddha, wrote:
: [T]here is the cultivation of meditative and contemplative techniques aimed at producing what might, for the lack of a suitable technical term in English, be referred to as "altered states of consciousness". In the technical vocabulary of Indian religious texts such states come to be termed "meditations" ([Skt.:] ''dhyāna'' / [Pali:] ''jhāna'') or "concentrations" (''[[samādhi]]''); the attainment of such states of consciousness was generally regarded as bringing the practitioner to deeper knowledge and experience of the nature of the world. (Gethin, 1998, p. 10.)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[vipassana]]''.

Buddhist meditation techniques have become increasingly popular in the wider world, with many non-Buddhists taking them up for a variety of reasons. There is considerable homogeneity across meditative practices&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; such as [[Anapanasati|breath meditation]] and various recollections (''[[anussati]]'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; that are used across [[schools of Buddhism|Buddhist schools]], as well as significant diversity. In the [[Theravāda]] tradition alone, there are over fifty methods for developing mindfulness and forty for developing concentration, while in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] tradition there are thousands of visualization meditations.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (2003) writes that, in regard to the [[Satipatthana Sutta]], "there are more than fifty different practices outlined in this Sutta. The meditations that derive from these foundations of mindfulness are called ''vipassana''..., and in one form or another&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and by whatever name&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; are found in all the major Buddhist traditions" (p. 92). The forty concentrative meditation subjects refer to [[Visuddhimagga]]'s oft-referenced enumeration. Regarding Tibetan visualizations, Kamalashila (2003), writes: "The Tara meditation ... is one example out of thousands of subjects for visualization meditation, each one arising out of some meditator's visionary experience of enlightened qualities, seen in the form of [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[Bodhisattva]]s" (p. 227).&lt;/ref&gt; Most classical and contemporary Buddhist meditation guides are school-specific.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of contemporary school-specific "classics" include, from the Theravada tradition, Nyanaponika (1996) and, from the Zen tradition, Kapleau (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Theravada and Sarvastivada commentatorial tradition, and also the Tibetan tradition,&lt;ref name="Ray2004"&gt;Reginald Ray (2004), [https://www.lionsroar.com/dharma-dictionary-vipashyana/ ''What is Vipashyana?'']&lt;/ref&gt; the Buddha is said to have identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome meditative practice:
:* "serenity" or "tranquility" (Pali: ''[[samatha]]'') which steadies, composes, unifies and concentrates the mind;
:* "insight" (Pali: ''[[vipassana]]'') which enables one to see, explore and discern "formations" (conditioned phenomena based on the five [[Skandha|aggregates]]).&lt;ref&gt;These definitions of ''samatha'' and ''vipassana'' are based on the "Four Kinds of Persons Sutta" ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.94). This article's text is primarily based on Bodhi (2005), pp. 269–70, 440 ''n''. 13. See also [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.094.than.html Thanissaro (1998d)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the meditative development of serenity, one is able to weaken the obscuring [[Five Hindrances|hindrances]] and bring the mind to a collected, pliant and still state ([[samadhi]]). This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom ([[prajñā (Buddhism)|Prajñā]]) which is the quality of mind that can "clearly see" (''vi-passana'') the nature of phenomena. What exactly is to be seen various withing the Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref name="Ray2004"/&gt; In Theravada, all phenomena are to be seen as [[anicca|impermanent]], [[dukkha|suffering]], [[anatta|not-self]] and [[shunyata|empty]]. When this happens, one develops dispassion (''viraga'') for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go. It is through the release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, AN 2.30 in Bodhi (2005), pp. 267-68, and [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an02/an02.030.than.html Thanissaro (1998e)].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[modern era]], Buddhist meditation saw increasing popularity due to the influence of [[Buddhist modernism]] on Asian Buddhism, and western lay interest in [[Zen]] and the [[Vipassana movement]]. The spread of Buddhist meditation to the [[Western world]] paralleled the spread of [[Buddhism in the West]]. Buddhist meditation has also influenced Western Psychology, especially through the work of [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] who founded the [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction]] (MBSR) in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/stress/index.aspx|title=Mindfulness-Based Programs|website=University of Massachusetts Medical School}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modernized concept of mindfulness (based on the Buddhist term ''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]'') and related meditative practices has in turn led to several [[Mindfulness#Therapy programs|mindfulness based therapies]].

====Hinduism====
{{See also|Dhyana in Hinduism|Yoga}}

There are many schools and styles of meditation within Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Flood" /&gt;

=====Traditional=====
[[File:Sant Jñāneśvar.jpg|thumb|Sant Jñāneśvar]]
In pre-modern and traditional [[Hinduism|Hindu religions]], ''Yoga'' and ''Dhyana'' are done to realize union of one's eternal self or [[soul]], one's [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]]. In some Hindu traditions, such as [[Advaita Vedanta]] this is equated with the omnipresent and [[nondualism|non-dual]] [[Brahman]]. In others, such as the dualistic [[Yoga (philosophy)|the Yoga school]] and [[Samkhya]], the Self is referred to as [[Purusha]], a pure consciousness which is separate from matter. Depending on the tradition, this liberative event is referred to as [[moksha]], vimukti or [[kaivalya]].

The earliest clear references to meditation in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] literature are in the middle [[Upanishads]] and the [[Mahabharata]], the latter of which includes the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne, The Origin of Buddhist Meditation. Routledge 2007, page 51. The earliest reference is actually in the Mokshadharma, which dates to the early Buddhist period.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Katha Upanishad describes yoga, including meditation. On meditation in this and other post-Buddhist Hindu literature see Randall Collins, The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change. Harvard University Press, 2000, page 199.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gavin Flood]], the earlier [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] refers to meditation when it states that "having become calm and concentrated, one perceives the self (''ātman'') within oneself".&lt;ref name="Flood"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Flood | first=Gavin | year=1996 | title=An Introduction to Hinduism| publisher=Cambridge University Press | pages=94–95 |location=Cambridge | isbn=978-0-521-43878-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KpIWhKnYmF0C&amp;pg=PA94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most influential texts of classical Hindu Yoga is [[Patañjali]]'s [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga sutras]] (c. 400 CE), a text associated with Yoga and Samkhya, which outlines eight limbs leading to [[kaivalya]] ("aloneness"). These are ethical discipline ([[yamas]]), rules ([[niyamas]]), physical postures ([[āsanas]]), breath control ([[prāṇāyama]]), withdrawal from the senses ([[pratyāhāra]]), one-pointedness of mind ([[dhāraṇā]]), meditation ([[Dhyāna in Hinduism|dhyāna]]), and finally [[samādhi]].

Later developments in Hind meditation include the compilation of [[Hatha Yoga]] (forceful yoga) compendiums like the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]], the development of [[Bhakti yoga]] as a major form of meditation and [[Tantra]]. Another important Hindu yoga text is the [[Yoga Yajnavalkya]], which makes use of [[Hatha Yoga]] and Vedanta Philosophy.

In the sixth chapter of Bhāvārthadipikā&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Jnaneshvari |last=Shri |first=Jnaneshvar |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1978 |isbn=978-0887064883 |location=New York |pages=114–152 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita by Sri Jñāneśvar ([[Dnyaneshwar]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/nathasiddhas/jnanesvar-and-nivritti-nath |title=Jnanesvar and Nivritti Nath - The Great Natha Siddhas |date= |accessdate=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; meditation in [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|yoga]] is described as a state caused by the spontaneous awakening of the sacred energy [[Kundalini]] (not Prana or Chi), which creates a connection of the individual soul Ātman with universal Spirit - Paramātman.

====Taoism====
{{Main|Daoist meditation}}
[[File:Stage1.gif|thumb|upright| "Gathering the Light", Taoist meditation from ''[[The Secret of the Golden Flower]]'']]
Taoist or Daoist meditation has a long history, and has developed various techniques including concentration, visualization, ''[[qi]]'' cultivation, contemplation, and mindfulness meditations. Traditional Daoist meditative practices were influenced by [[Chinese Buddhism]] beginning around the 5th century, and later had influence upon [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] and the [[Chinese martial arts]].

Livia Kohn distinguishes three basic types of Daoist meditation: "concentrative", "insight", and "visualization".&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, Livia (2008), "Meditation and visualization," in ''The Encyclopedia of Taoism'', ed. by Fabrizio Pregadio, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ding'' [[wikt:定|定]] (literally means "decide; settle; stabilize") refers to "deep concentration", "intent contemplation", or "perfect absorption". ''Guan'' [[wikt:觀|觀]] (lit. "watch; observe; view") meditation seeks to merge and attain unity with the Dao. It was developed by [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) Daoist masters based upon the ''[[Tiantai]]'' Buddhist practice of ''[[Vipassanā]]'' "insight" or "wisdom" meditation. ''Cun'' [[wikt:存|存]] (lit. "exist; be present; survive") has a sense of "to cause to exist; to make present" in the meditation techniques popularized by the Daoist [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School]]s. A meditator visualizes or actualizes solar and lunar essences, lights, and deities within his/her body, which supposedly results in health and longevity, even ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' 仙/仚/僊, "immortality".

The (late 4th century BCE) ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' essay ''[[Neiye]]'' "Inward training" is the oldest received writing on the subject of ''[[qi]]'' cultivation and breath-control meditation techniques.&lt;ref name='Cambridge'&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Harper | first1=Donald | first2=Michael | last2=Loewe | first3=Edward L. | last3=Shaughnessy| title=The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 BC| publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=2007 | origyear=First published in 1999 | location=Cambridge, U.K. | page=880 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=cHA7Ey0-pbEC&amp;dq=cambridge++history+of+ancient+china&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=| isbn=978-0-521-47030-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, "When you enlarge your mind and let go of it, when you relax your vital breath and expand it, when your body is calm and unmoving: And you can maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances. ... This is called "revolving the vital breath": Your thoughts and deeds seem heavenly."&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Harold D. (1999), ''Original Tao: Inward Training (''Nei-yeh'') and the Foundations of Taoist Mysticism'', Columbia University Press, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The (c. 3rd century BCE) Daoist ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' records ''[[zuowang]]'' or "sitting forgetting" meditation. [[Confucius]] asked his disciple [[Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)|Yan Hui]] to explain what "sit and forget" means: "I slough off my limbs and trunk, dim my intelligence, depart from my form, leave knowledge behind, and become identical with the Transformational Thoroughfare."&lt;ref&gt;Mair, Victor H., tr. (1994), ''Wandering on the Way: Early Taoist Tales and Parables of Chuang Tzu'', Bantam Books, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daoist meditation practices are central to [[Chinese martial arts]] (and some [[Japanese martial arts]]), especially the ''qi''-related ''[[neijia]]'' "internal martial arts". Some well-known examples are ''[[Tao Yin|daoyin]]'' "guiding and pulling", ''[[qigong]]'' "life-energy exercises", ''[[neigong]]'' "internal exercises", ''[[neidan]]'' "internal alchemy", and ''[[taijiquan]]'' "great ultimate boxing", which is thought of as moving meditation. One common explanation contrasts "movement in stillness" referring to energetic visualization of ''qi'' circulation in ''qigong'' and ''[[zuochan]]'' "seated meditation",&lt;ref name=Perez/&gt; versus "stillness in movement" referring to a state of meditative calm in ''taijiquan'' forms.

====Bahá'í Faith====
In the teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], meditation along with [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|prayer]] are both primary tools for spiritual development&lt;ref name="bahai-meditation"&gt;{{cite web | title=Prayer, Meditation, and Fasting | accessdate=2011-07-01 | url=http://info.bahai.org/article-1-4-0-7.html | publisher=Bahá'í International Community | year=2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805130355/http://info.bahai.org/article-1-4-0-7.html | archive-date=2011-08-05 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and mainly refer to one's reflection on the words of God.&lt;ref name="Smith-meditation"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=Meditation |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-85168-184-6 |pages=243–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[prayer]] and meditation are linked, where meditation happens generally in a prayerful attitude, prayer is seen specifically as turning toward God,&lt;ref name="Smith-prayer"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=Prayer |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-85168-184-6 |pages=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meditation is seen as a communion with one's self where one focuses on the divine.&lt;ref name="Smith-meditation"/&gt;

The [[Bahá'í teachings]] note that the purpose of meditation is to strengthen one's understanding of the words of God, and to make one's soul more susceptible to their potentially transformative power,&lt;ref name="Smith-meditation"/&gt; more receptive to the need for both prayer and meditation to bring about and maintain a spiritual communion with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |editor=Hornby, Helen |year=1983 |title=Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust, New Delhi, India |isbn=978-81-85091-46-4 |url=http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance | page=506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the religion, never specified any particular form of meditation, and thus each person is free to choose their own form.&lt;ref name="bahai-meditation" /&gt; However, he specifically did state that Bahá'ís should read a passage of the [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í writings]] twice a day, once in the morning, and once in the evening, and meditate on it.

====Judaism====
{{Main|Jewish meditation}}

There is evidence that Judaism has had meditative practices that go back thousands of years.&lt;ref name=Verman1 &gt;''The history and varieties of Jewish meditation'' by Mark Verman 1997 {{ISBN|978-1-56821-522-8}} page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, L. (1976) ''Jewish Mystical Testimonies'', Jerusalem, Keter Publishing House Jerusalem Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the [[Torah]], the patriarch [[Isaac]] is described as going ''"לשוח"'' (''lasuach'') in the field—a term understood by all commentators as some type of meditative practice ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 24:63).&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, A. (1978) ''Meditation and the Bible'', Maine, Samuel Weiser Inc., p 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, there are indications throughout the [[Tanakh]] (the Hebrew [[Bible]]) that meditation was used by the prophets.&lt;ref name=Verman45 &gt;''The history and varieties of Jewish meditation'' by Mark Verman 1997 {{ISBN|978-1-56821-522-8}} page 45&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Old Testament]], there are two [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words for meditation: ''hāgâ'' ({{lang-he|הגה}}), which means ''to sigh'' or ''murmur'', but also ''to meditate'', and ''sîḥâ'' ({{lang-he|שיחה}}), which means ''to muse'', or ''rehearse in one's mind''.&lt;ref name="Kaplan, A. 1985"&gt;Kaplan, A. (1985) ''Jewish Meditation: A Practical Guide,'' New York Schocken Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some meditative traditions have been encouraged in the school of Judaism known as [[Kabbalah]], and some Jews have described Kabbalah as an inherently meditative field of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scholem|first1=Gershom Gerhard|title=Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism|date=1961|publisher=Schocken Books|isbn=9780805210422|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kD2y4wMOlAoC&amp;pg=PA34|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, A.

(1996) ''The Essential Kabbalah: The Heart of Jewish Mysticism'', San Francisco, HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aryeh Kaplan]] has argued that, for the Kabbalist, the ultimate purpose of meditative practice is to understand and cleave to the Divine.&lt;ref name="Kaplan, A. 1985"/&gt; Classic methods include the mental visualisation of the supernal realms the soul navigates through to achieve certain ends. One of the best known types of meditation in early Jewish mysticism was the work of the [[Merkabah]], from the root /R-K-B/ meaning "chariot" (of God).&lt;ref name="Kaplan, A. 1985"/&gt;

Meditation has been of interest to a wide variety of modern Jews. In modern Jewish practice, one of the best known meditative practices is called ''"[[hitbodedut]]"'' (''התבודדות'', alternatively transliterated as "hisbodedus"), and is explained in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]], [[Hasidic]], and [[Mussar Movement|Mussar]] writings, especially the Hasidic method of Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslav]]. The word derives from the Hebrew word "boded" (בודד), meaning the state of being alone.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, A. (1978) op cit p2&lt;/ref&gt; Another Hasidic system is the [[Habad]] method of "hisbonenus", related to the [[Sephirah]] of "Binah", Hebrew for understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, (1982) op cit, p13&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is the analytical reflective process of making oneself understand a mystical concept well, that follows and internalises its study in Hasidic writings.

The [[Musar Movement]], founded by Rabbi Israel Salanter in the middle of the nineteenth-century, emphasized meditative practices of [[introspection]] and [[Mental image|visualization]] that could help to improve moral character.&lt;ref&gt;Claussen, Geoffrey.

[[Christian meditation]] is a term for a form of prayer in which a structured attempt is made to get in touch with and deliberately reflect upon the revelations of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Meditation for Beginners'' by Thomas Zanzig, Marilyn Kielbasa 2000, {{ISBN|0-88489-361-8}} page 7&lt;/ref&gt; The word meditation comes from the Latin word ''meditari'', which means to concentrate. Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (e.g. a [[biblical]] scene involving [[Jesus]] and the [[Virgin Mary]]) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God.&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to Christian spirituality'' by F. Antonisamy, 2000 {{ISBN|81-7109-429-5}} pages 76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rosary]] is a devotion for the meditation of the mysteries of Jesus and Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fatima.org/it/essentials/whatucando/potetefare.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-06-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601223011/http://www.fatima.org/it/essentials/whatucando/potetefare.asp |archive-date=2017-06-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theholyrosary.org/|title=The Holy Rosary|website=www.theholyrosary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;“The gentle repetition of its prayers makes it an excellent means to moving into deeper meditation. It gives us an opportunity to open ourselves to God’s word, to refine our interior gaze by turning our minds to the life of Christ. The first principle is that meditation is learned through practice. Many people who practice rosary meditation begin very simply and gradually develop a more sophisticated meditation. The meditator learns to hear an interior voice, the voice of God”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loyolapress.com/our-catholic-faith/prayer/personal-prayer-life/different-ways-to-pray/the-rosary-as-a-tool-for-meditation-by-liz-kelly|title=The Rosary as a Tool for Meditation by Liz Kelly|website=www.loyolapress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian meditation contrasts with Eastern forms of meditation as radically as the portrayal of [[God the Father]] in the Bible contrasts with depictions of [[Krishna]] or [[Brahman]] in Indian teachings.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Meditation'' by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 {{ISBN|1-57383-227-8}} page 12&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Eastern meditations, most styles of Christian meditations do not rely on the repeated use of [[mantra]]s, and yet are also intended to stimulate thought and deepen meaning. Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Meditation'' by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 {{ISBN|1-57383-227-8}} pages 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3'' by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2003 {{ISBN|90-04-12654-6}} page 488&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Aspects of Christian meditation]]'', the [[Catholic Church]] warned of potential incompatibilities in mixing Christian and Eastern styles of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfmed.htm EWTN: [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] ''Letter on certain aspects of Christian meditation'' (in English), October 15, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, in ''[[A Christian reflection on the New Age]]'' the [[Holy See|Vatican]] announced that the "Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the [[New Age]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/08/local/me-relignewage8/2 Los Angeles Times, February 8, 2003, ''New Age Beliefs Aren't Christian, Vatican Finds'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2722743.stm|title=Vatican sounds New Age alert|date=4 February 2003|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/interelg/documents/rc_pc_interelg_doc_20030203_press-conf-new-age_en.html|title=PRESENTATIONS OF HOLY SEE'S DOCUMENT ON NEW AGE|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian meditation is sometimes taken to mean the middle level in a broad three stage characterization of prayer: it then involves more reflection than first level vocal [[prayer]], but is more structured than the multiple layers of [[contemplation]] in Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;''Simple Ways to Pray'' by Emilie Griffin 2005 {{ISBN|0-7425-5084-2}} page 134&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] in 2007 the [[Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Diocese of Limburg|Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality]] in the [[Holy Cross Church, Frankfurt-Bornheim]] was founded by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg]]. In and by the centre different kinds of [[church service]]s are offered like for example with elements such as [[expressionist dance]], moreover days of exercises of [[Christian mysticism]], [[contemplation|contemplative]] prayer, [[Meditation music#Christian meditation music|meditative singing]], meditation courses, [[Zen]]-meditation courses, days of reflection, [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|spiritual exercises]] and [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreats]]&lt;ref name="HK-Program"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://meditationszentrum.bistumlimburg.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Bereiche/meditationszentrum.bistum-limburg.de/Programm_2016_2017.pdf| publisher=Heilig Kreuz – Zentrum für christliche Meditation und Spiritualität| title=Heilig Kreuz – Zentrum für christliche Meditation und Spiritualität – Programm September 2016 bis Juli 2017| format=PDF| language=German | date=14 June 2016| accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early studies on states of consciousness conducted by Roland Fischer &lt;ref&gt;Roland Fischer (1971), A Cartography of the Ecstatic and Meditative States. In Science, Vol 174 Num 4012 26 November 1971&lt;/ref&gt; found evidence of mystical experience description in the writings of [[Saint Teresa of Avila]]. In her autobiography she describes that, at the peak of a praying experience "... the soul neither hears nor sees nor feels. While it lasts, none of the senses perceives or knows what is taking place".&lt;ref&gt;Saint Teresa, The Life of Saint Teresa, J. M. Cohen, Transl. (Penquin, Baltimore, 1957), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponds to the fourth stage described by Saint Teresa, "Devotion of Ecstasy", where the consciousness of being in the body disappears, as an effect of deep transcendent meditation in prayer.

====Islam====
{{Main|Sufi|Muraqaba|Sema|Dhikr#Sufi view}}

[[Salah]] is a mandatory act of devotion performed by Muslims five times per day. The body goes through sets of different postures, as the mind attains a level of concentration called ''khushu'''.

A second optional type of meditation, called [[dhikr]], meaning remembering and mentioning God, is interpreted in different meditative techniques in [[Sufism]] or Islamic mysticism.&lt;ref name="Prayer page 147-149"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Education' page 63"/&gt; This became one of the essential elements of Sufism as it was systematized traditionally. It is juxtaposed with ''fikr'' (thinking) which leads to knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Sainthood and revelatory discourse'' by David Emmanuel Singh 2003 {{ISBN|81-7214-728-7}} page 154&lt;/ref&gt; By the 12th century, the practice of Sufism included specific meditative techniques, and its followers practiced breathing controls and the repetition of holy words.&lt;ref name="Spiritual Psychology' page 109"/&gt;

Numerous [[Sufism|Sufi traditions]] place emphasis upon a meditative procedure which comes from the cognitive aspect to one of the two principal approaches to be found in the [[Buddhist meditation|Buddhist traditions]]: that of the [[samadhi (Buddhism)|concentration]] technique, involving high-intensity and sharply focused [[introspection]]. In the Oveyssi-Shahmaghsoudi Sufi order, for example, this is particularly evident, where [[muraqaba]] takes the form of tamarkoz, the latter being a [[Persian language|Persian]] term that means "concentration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0533316489224010 |title=Book Reviews |journal=Group Analysis |volume=22 |issue=4 |page=434 |year=2016 |last1=Dwivedi |first1=Kedar Nath }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tafakkur'' or ''tadabbur'' in Sufism literally means ''reflection upon the [[universe]]'': this is considered to permit access to a form of [[cognitive]] and [[emotion]]al development that can emanate only from the higher level, i.e. from God. The sensation of receiving [[Revelation|divine inspiration]] awakens and liberates both [[heart]] and [[intellect]], permitting such inner growth that the apparently mundane actually takes on the quality of the [[infinity|infinite]]. Muslim teachings embrace life as a test of one's submission to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Khalifa | first=Rashad | title=Quran: The Final Testament | publisher=Universal Unity | year=2001 | page=536 | isbn=978-1-881893-05-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pagan and occult religions====
Religions and religious movements which use magic, such as [[Wicca]], [[Thelema]], [[Neopaganism]], [[occultism]] etc., often require their adherents to meditate as a preliminary to the magical work. This is because magic is often thought to require a particular state of mind in order to make contact with spirits, or because one has to visualize one's goal or otherwise keep intent focused for a long period during the ritual in order to see the desired outcome. Meditation practice in these religions usually revolves around visualization, absorbing energy from the universe or higher self, directing one's internal energy, and inducing various [[trance]] states. Meditation and magic practice often overlap in these religions as meditation is often seen as merely a stepping stone to supernatural power, and the meditation sessions may be peppered with various chants and spells.

===Modern spirituality===

Mantra meditation, with the use of a [[japa mala]] and especially with focus on the [[Hare Krishna maha-mantra]], is a central practice of the [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] faith tradition and the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), also known as the Hare Krishna movement. Other popular [[New Religious Movements]] include the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], [[Vedanta Society]], [[Divine Light Mission]], [[Chinmaya Mission]], [[Rajneesh|Osho]], Sahaja Yoga, [[Transcendental Meditation]], [[Kalki Bhagavan|Oneness University]], [[Brahma Kumaris]] and [[Vihangam Yoga]].

====New Age====
{{Main|New Age}}
New Age meditations are often influenced by Eastern philosophy, mysticism, [[yoga]], Hinduism and Buddhism, yet may contain some degree of Western influence. In the West, meditation found its mainstream roots through the [[counterculture of the 1960s|social revolution of the 1960s and 1970s]], when many of the [[baby boomers|youth of the day]] rebelled against traditional religion as a reaction against what some perceived as the failure of Christianity to provide spiritual and ethical guidance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899555-1,00.html Time Magazine, ''Youth: The Hippies'' Friday, Jul. 07, 1967]&lt;/ref&gt;
New Age meditation as practised by the early hippies is regarded for its techniques of blanking out the mind and releasing oneself from conscious thinking. This is often aided by repetitive chanting of a mantra, or focusing on an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=George | last=Barnia | title=The Index of Leading Spiritual Indicators | publisher=Word Publishing | location=Dallas TX | year=1996 | url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/newage.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Age meditation evolved into a range of purposes and practices, from serenity and balance to access to other realms of consciousness to the concentration of energy in group meditation to the supreme goal of [[samadhi]], as in the ancient yogic practice of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=John | last=Lash | title=The Seeker's Handbook: The Complete Guide to Spiritual Pathfinding | publisher=Harmony Books | location=New York | year=1990 | page=320 | isbn=978-0-517-57797-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mindfulness==

Over the past 20 years, mindfulness and mindfulness-based programs have been used to assist people, whether they be clinically sick or healthy.&lt;ref&gt;"In the last 20 years, mindfulness has become the focus of considerable attention for a large community of clinicians and, to a lesser extent, empirical psychology." - [http://brainimaging.waisman.wisc.edu/~perlman/0903-EmoPaper/BishopMindfulnessDefinition2004.pdf Mindfulness: A Proposed Operation Definition]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]], who founded the [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program]] in 1979, has defined mindfulness as 'moment to moment non-judgmental awareness.'&lt;ref name=kz1998&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jon Kabat-Zinn |author2=Elizabeth Wheeler |author3=Timothy Light |author4=Anne Skillings |author5=Mark J.

==Secular applications==

As stated by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], a US government entity within the National Institutes of Health that advocates various forms of [[Alternative Medicine]], ''"Meditation may be practiced for many reasons, such as to increase calmness and physical relaxation, to improve psychological balance, to cope with illness, or to enhance overall health and well-being."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation/overview.htm |title=Meditation: An Introduction |publisher=[[NCCIH]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Meditation techniques have also been used by Western theories of counseling and [[psychotherapy]]. Relaxation training works toward achieving mental and muscle relaxation to reduce daily stresses.

[[Jacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation]] was developed by American physician [[Edmund Jacobson]] in the early 1920s. In this practice one tenses and then relaxes muscle groups in a sequential pattern whilst concentrating on how they feel. The method has been seen to help people with many conditions, especially extreme anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Progressive muscle relaxation]] from where these two references were taken showing that this method reduces extreme anxiety, 1) {{Cite book | author=Craske | author2=Barlow | last-author-amp=yes | title=Worry | publication-date=2006 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | page=53 | isbn=978-0-19-530001-7 | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Jacobson is credited with developing the initial progressive relaxation procedure. These techniques are used in conjunction with other behavioral techniques. Originally used with [[systematic desensitization]], relaxation techniques are now used with other clinical problems. Meditation, [[hypnosis]] and [[biofeedback]]-induced relaxation are a few of the techniques used with relaxation training.

One of the eight essential phases of [[EMDR]] (developed by [[Francine Shapiro]]), bringing adequate closure to the end of each session, also entails the use of relaxation techniques, including meditation. Multimodal therapy, a technically eclectic approach to behavioral therapy, also employs the use of meditation as a technique used in individual therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Corey | first=G. | title=Theory and practice of counseling and psychotherapy | edition=6th | publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Co. |date=March 2000 | location=Belmont, CA | page=550 | isbn=978-0-534-34823-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there are many different types of meditation practiced in western culture. Mindful breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and loving kindness meditations for instance have been found to provide cognitive benefits such as relaxation and decentering. With training in meditation, depressive rumination can be decreased and overall peace of mind can flourish. Different techniques have shown to work better for different people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Feldman | first=G. | title=Differential effects of mindful breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and loving-kindness meditation on decentering and negative reactions to repetitive thoughts | journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy | year=2010 | doi=10.1016/j.brat.2010.06.006 | volume=48 | issue=10 | pages=1002–1011| pmc=2932656 | pmid=20633873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound-based meditation===

[[Herbert Benson]] of [[Harvard Medical School]] conducted a series of clinical tests on meditators from various disciplines, including the [[Transcendental Meditation technique]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. In 1975, Benson published a book titled ''[[The Relaxation Response]]'' where he outlined his own version of meditation for relaxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Relaxation Response |publisher=[[William Morrow Paperbacks]], Exp Upd edition (February 8, 2000)|author1=Herbert Benson |author2=Miriam Z.

[[Western Christian]] meditation contrasts with most other approaches in that it does not involve the repetition of any phrase or action and requires no specific posture. Western [[Christian meditation]] progressed from the 6th century practice of Bible reading among [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monks called [[Lectio Divina]], i.e. divine reading. Its four formal steps as a "ladder" were defined by the monk [[Guigo II]] in the 12th century with the Latin terms ''lectio'', ''meditatio'', ''oratio'', and ''contemplatio'' (i.e. read, ponder, pray, contemplate). Western [[Christian meditation]] was further developed by saints such as [[Ignatius of Loyola]] and [[Teresa of Avila]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Spirituality: A Historical Sketch'' by George Lane 2005 {{ISBN|0-8294-2081-9}} page 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition'' by Lawrence S.

===Modern dissemination in the west===
&lt;!--- In progress: This section is being constructed -- 5 July 2010 ---&gt;
Methods of meditation have been cross-culturally disseminated at various times throughout history, such as Buddhism going to East Asia, and [[History of Sufism|Sufi practices]] going to many Islamic societies. Of special relevance to the modern world is the dissemination of meditative practices since the late 19th century, accompanying increased travel and communication among cultures worldwide. Most prominent has been the transmission of numerous Asian-derived practices to the West. In addition, interest in some Western-based meditative practices has also been revived,&lt;ref name=reininger98&gt;{{Cite book |title=Centering prayer in daily life and ministry |editor=Gustave Reininger |year=1997 |publisher=Continuum |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8264-1041-2 |pages=|doi=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xEhaEDm7jsIC&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=isbn=978-0-8264-1041-2+Centering+prayer+in+daily+life+and+ministry&amp;q |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these have been disseminated to a limited extent to Asian countries.&lt;ref name=contempout&gt;The organization [http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/site/PageServer?pagename=community_chapters_international Contemplative Outreach] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103193809/http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/site/PageServer?pagename=community_chapters_international |date=2011-11-03 }}, which teaches Christian [[Centering Prayer]], has chapters in non-Western locations in Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea (accessed 5 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Also evident is some extent of influence over [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking through [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', although he states, "I find that a meditation practitioner is often quite useless and that a contemplation practitioner is always insane".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meditation|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0002.661/--meditation?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=meditation|website=quod.lib.umich.edu|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas about Eastern meditation had begun "seeping into American popular culture even before the American Revolution through the various sects of European occult Christianity",&lt;ref name=taylor99&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Eugene Taylor |year=1999 |title=Introduction |editor1=Michael Murphy |editor2=Steven Donovan |editor3=Eugene Taylor |journal=The Physical and Psychological Effects of Meditation: A Review of Contemporary Research with a Comprehensive Bibliography 1931-1996 |pages=1–32 |url=http://library.noetic.org/library/publication-bibliographies/physical-and-psychological-effects-meditation |doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} and such ideas "came pouring in [to America] during the era of the transcendentalists, especially between the 1840s and the 1880s."&lt;ref name=taylor99/&gt;{{rp|3}} The following decades saw further spread of these ideas to America:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The [[World Parliament of Religions]], held in Chicago in 1893, was the landmark event that increased Western awareness of meditation. This was the first time that Western audiences on American soil received Asian spiritual teachings from Asians themselves. Thereafter, [[Swami Vivekananda]]... [founded] various [[Vedanta]] ashrams... [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] lectured at Harvard on Theravada Buddhist meditation in 1904; [[Abdul Baha]] ... [toured] the US teaching the principles of Bahai, and [[Soyen Shaku]] toured in 1907 teaching Zen...&lt;ref name=taylor99/&gt;{{rp|4}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Meditating in Madison Square Park.jpg|thumb|right|Meditating in [[Madison Square Park]], [[New York City]]]]
More recently, in the 1960s, another surge in Western interest in meditative practices began. Observers have suggested many types of explanations for this interest in Eastern meditation and revived Western contemplation. [[Thomas Keating]], a founder of [[Contemplative Outreach]], wrote that "the rush to the East is a symptom of what is lacking in the West. There is a deep spiritual hunger that is not being satisfied in the West."&lt;ref name=keating97&gt;{{Cite book |title=Open mind, open heart |last=Keating |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Keating |date=1997 |publisher=Continuum |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8264-0696-5 |origyear=First published in 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}} [[Daniel Goleman]], a scholar of meditation, suggested that the shift in interest from "established religions" to meditative practices "is caused by the scarcity of the personal experience of these [meditation-derived] transcendental states&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the living spirit at the common core of all religions."&lt;ref name=goleman88/&gt;{{rp|xxiv}}

Another suggested contributing factor is the rise of communist political power in Asia, which "set the stage for an influx of Asian spiritual teachers to the West",&lt;ref name=taylor99/&gt;{{rp|7}} oftentimes as refugees.&lt;ref name=taylorinflux&gt;Taylor (1999, p. 7) stated that "the increased Soviet influence in India, the Cultural Revolution in China, the Communist Chinese takeover of Tibet and Mongolia, and the increased political influence of Chinese Communism in Korea and Southeast Asia were key forces that collectively set the stage for an influx of Asian spiritual teachers to the West. An entirely new generation of them appeared on the American scene and they found a willing audience of devotees within the American counter-culture. [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Swami A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami]], [[Swami Satchidananda|Swami Satchitananda]], [[Prem Rawat|Guru Maharaji]], [[Kirpal Singh|Kerpal Singh]], [[Nyanaponika Thera|Nayanaponika Thera]], [[Swami Rama]], [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], [[Chogyam Trungpa]], [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]], [[Muktananda|Swami Muktananda]], [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Sri Bagwan Rujneesh]], [[Vilayat Inayat Khan|Pir Viliyat Kahn]], and the [[Karmapa]] were but a few of the names that found followers in the United States... [and] the most well known and influential... today remains [[Tenzin Gyatso]], the fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meditation, religion and drugs==
{{Main|Entheogen|Religion and drugs}}
{{see also|Psychedelic psychotherapy}}
Many major traditions in which meditation is practiced, such as Buddhism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buddhism.about.com/od/theprecepts/a/preceptsintro.htm |title=The Buddhist Precepts. An Introduction |first=Barbara |last=O'Brien |publisher=[[about.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hinduism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The natural mind: an investigation of drugs and the higher consciousness |last=Weil |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Weil |year=1998 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=|isbn=9780395911563 |pages=68–69 |url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; advise members not to consume [[intoxicants]], while others, such as the Rastafarian movements and Native American Church, view drugs as integral to their religious lifestyle.

The fifth of the five precepts of the [[The Five Precepts|Pancasila]], the ethical code in the [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist]] traditions, states that adherents must: "abstain from fermented and distilled beverages that cause heedlessness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buddhism.about.com/od/theprecepts/a/fifthprecept.htm|title=The Fifth Buddhist Precept|first=Barbara |last=O'Brien |publisher=[[about.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the ingestion of psychoactives has been a central feature in the rituals of many religions, in order to produce [[altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]]. In several traditional [[shamanistic]] ceremonies, drugs are used as agents of ritual. In the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] is believed to be a gift from [[Jah]] and a [[Religious and spiritual use of cannabis|sacred herb]] to be used regularly, while alcohol is considered to debase man. Native Americans use [[peyote]], as part of religious ceremony, continuing today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nativeamericanchurch.com/law.html |title=PUBLIC LAW 103-344 [H.R. 4230]; October 6, 1994 |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, the [[soma (drink)|soma]] drink has a long history of use alongside prayer and sacrifice, and is mentioned in the [[Vedas]].

During the 1960s and 70s, both eastern meditation traditions and psychedelics, such as [[LSD]], became popular in America, and it was suggested that LSD use and meditation were both means to the same spiritual/existential end.&lt;ref&gt;"A Zen Life" a documentary film about the life of D.T. Suzuki&lt;/ref&gt; Many practitioners of eastern traditions rejected this idea, including many who had tried LSD themselves. In ''The Master Game'', [[Robert S de Ropp]] writes that the "door to full consciousness" can be glimpsed with the aid of substances, but to "pass beyond the door" requires yoga and meditation. Other authors, such as [[Rick Strassman]], believe that the relationship between religious experiences reached by way of meditation and through the use of psychedelic drugs deserves further exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Strassman, ''DMT: The Spirit Molecule: A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death and Mystical Experiences'', 320 pages, Park Street Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-89281-927-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Mindfulness meditation, in its modern form, is regarded by psychologist [[Thomas Joiner]] to have been "corrupted" for commercial gain by self-help celebrities, and he suggests that it encourages narcissistic and self-obsessed mindsets which can be unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23531430-900-lost-in-meditation-two-books-argue-over-mindfulness/amp/|title=Lost in meditation: Two books argue over mindfulness - New Scientist|website=www.newscientist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/mindlessness-9780190200626?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Mindlessness: The Corruption of Mindfulness in a Culture of Narcissism|first=Thomas|last=Joiner|date=28 September 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oath ''More Judaico''''' or '''Jewish Oath''' was a special form of [[oath]], rooted in antisemitsm and accompanied by certain ceremonies and often intentionally humiliating, painful or dangerous, that Jews were required to take in [[Europe]]an [[court]]s of [[law]] until the 20th century. ''More Judaico'' is [[Latin]] for "on/by the Jewish custom." The question of the trustworthiness of the Jewish oath was intimately connected with the meaning that [[Christian]] authorities assigned to the ''[[Kol Nidre]]'' prayer, recited by Jews on [[Yom Kippur]], and the whole of the legislation regarding the oath was characteristic of the [[Jews in the Middle Ages|attitude of medieval states toward their Jewish subjects]]. The [[Separation of church and state#History|identification of Church and State]] seemed to render it necessary to have a different formula for those outside the state church.

==Historical development==
The [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disability]] imposed on a [[Jew]] engaged in legal contention with a [[Christian]] dates back to [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]], who declared that neither Jews nor [[heresy|heretics]] should be admitted as [[witness]]es against Christians;  [[Secularism|secular]] courts, however, did not recognize this disability. Thus, in the safe conducts issued by the [[Carolingian]] kings in the 9th century, Jews and Christians were treated as equals, and consequently the [[testimony]] of the former, whether given under [[oath]] or not, was as admissible as the latter. This was distinctly stated in the [[charter]] granted by [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] to the Jews of [[Speyer]] in 1090. The law of [[Duke]] [[Frederick II of Austria]] (1244), which served as a model for much other [[legislation]] on the Jews, merely required a Jew to [[oath|swear]] "super Rodal" (by the [[Torah]]). Similar laws existed in [[England]], [[Portugal]], and [[Hungary]]; Hungary waived the requirement to swear on the [[Torah]] in trivial cases.

There were, however, some older laws that prescribed certain practices intended to mock Jews in court. These examples illustrated the kinds of humiliating rituals that accompanied the taking of the oath:
*[[Byzantine Empire]], 10th century: the Jew would wear a [[Crown of thorns|girdle of thorns]] around his loins, stand in water, and swear by "Barase Baraa" ([[Book of Genesis|Bereshit Bara]]), so that if he spoke untruth, he would be swallowed by the earth just like [[Dathan]] and [[Abiram]] in [[Book_of_Numbers#Chapter_15-17|Numbers 16:1–27]].
*[[Arles]] (c. 1150): a wreath of thorns would be hung on the swearer's neck, others would grovel at his knees, and a thorn branch five [[ell]]s in length would be pulled "between his loins" while he swore and called down upon himself all the [[Curse#Curses in the Bible|curses]] of the Torah.
*[[Swabia]] (13th century): the Jew would stand on the hide of a [[Unclean animals|sow]] or a [[Lamb of God|bloody lamb]].
*[[Silesia]] (1422): the Jew would stand on a three-legged stool and have to pay a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] each time he fell, finally losing his [[legal case|case]] if he fell four times.
*[[Dortmund]]: the Jew would be fined each time he halted in repeating the oath.
*[[Vrbové]], Hungary (1517): the Jew would stand barefooted and swear with his face turned to the east, holding the [[Pentateuch]] in his hand.
*[[Breslau]] (c. 1455): the Jew would stand [[Yarmulke#Purpose|bareheaded]] and pronounce the name of [[Yahweh]].

==An example: Frankfurt oath==
[[File:Oathmorejudaico.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A 17th century drawing of a German Jew taking a Jewish oath.]]
The following formula, originally in Middle High German, was used in Frankfurt on the Main about 1392:[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/jewish/1392-jews-frankfort.html]
:''The Jew shall stand on a sow's skin and the five books of Master Moses shall lie before him, and his right hand up to the wrist shall lie on the book and he shall repeat after him who administers the oath of the Jews:''

:''Regarding such property of which the man accuses you, you know nothing of it, nor do you have it. You never had it in your possession, you do not have it in any of your chests, you have not buried it in the earth, nor locked it with locks, so help you God who created heaven and earth, valley and hill, woods, trees, and grass, and so help you the law which God himself created and wrote with His own hand and gave Moses on Sinai's mount. And so help you the five books of Moses that you may nevermore enjoy a bite without soiling yourself all over as did the King of Babylon.''

:''And may that sulphur and pitch flow down upon your neck that flowed over Sodom and Gomorrah, and the same pitch that flowed over Babylon flow over you, but two hundred times more, and may the earth envelop and swallow you up as it did Dathan and Abiram. And may your dust never join other dust, and your earth never join other earth in the bosom of Master Abraham if what you say is not true and right.'' [This refers either to a decent burial or to resurrection.] ''And so help you Adonai, you have sworn the truth.''

:''If not, may you become as leprous as Naaman and Gehazi, and may the calamity strike you that the Israelite people escaped as they journeyed forth from Egypt's land. And may a bleeding and a flowing come forth from you and never cease, as your people wished upon themselves when they condemned God, Jesus Christ, among themselves, and tortured Him and said: {{bibleref|Matthew|27:25}} "His blood be upon us and our children." It is true, so help you God who appeared to Moses in a burning bush which yet remained unconsumed. It is true by the oath that you have sworn, by the soul which you bring on the Day of Judgment before the Court, [before the God of] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is true, so help you God and the oath you have sworn. [Amen].''

==The oath as a Jewish disability==
A decidedly aggressive change took place when, in 1555, the [[Germany|German]] imperial court procedure (''Reichskammergerichtsordnung'') prescribed a form of oath that, with some alterations, formed a model to subsequent legislation. Horrible were the terms in which the swearer called down upon himself all the curses of [[Leviticus]] and [[Deuteronomy]], the [[ten plagues]] of [[Egypt]], the [[leprosy]] of [[Naaman]] and [[Gehazi]] (see 2 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 5), the fate of Dathan and Abiram, etc.

According to a recount in his "Gesammelte Schriften," the great German-Jewish philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] persuaded the [[Prussia]]n government to moderate the terms of the oath during the 18th century. The small German states gradually surrendered the most objectionable features of the oath: [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), in 1828; [[Oldenburg]], 1829; [[Württemberg]], 1832; [[Saxony]], 1839 (on which occasion [[Zecharias Frankel]] published his famous "Die Eidesleistung"); [[Schaumburg-Lippe]] and [[Anhalt]]-[[Bernburg]], 1842; and [[Hesse-Homburg]], 1865. 

Prussia retained the obnoxious formula until March 15, 1869; the [[Netherlands]] modified the oath in 1818, and [[Russia]] in 1838 and 1860. The Jewish [[advocate]] [[Isaac Adolphe Crémieux]] won great fame by effecting the abolition of the oath through a case brought before the court of [[Nîmes]] in 1827. [[Lazard Isidor]], as [[rabbi]] of [[Pfalzburg]], refused in 1839 to open the [[synagogue]] for such an oath; prosecuted for [[contempt of court]], he was defended by Crémieux and acquitted. The French Supreme Court finally declared the oath [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]] on March 3, 1846. However, as late as 1902, a court in [[Romania]] upheld that country's version of the oath.

'''Overdetermination''' occurs when a single-observed effect is determined by multiple causes, any one of which alone would be sufficient to account for ("determine") the effect. That is, there are more causes present than are necessary to cause the effect. In the [[philosophy of science]], this means that more evidence is available than is necessary to justify a conclusion. Overdetermination is in contrast to [[underdetermination]], when the number or strength of causes is insufficient. 

The term "overdetermination" ({{lang-de|Überdeterminierung}}) was also used by [[Sigmund Freud]] as a key concept in his [[psychoanalysis]].

==Freud and psychoanalysis==

Freud wrote in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' that many features of dreams were usually "overdetermined," in that they were caused by multiple factors in the life of the dreamer, from the "residue of the day" (superficial memories of recent life) to deeply repressed traumas and unconscious wishes, these being "potent thoughts".  Freud favored interpretations which accounted for such features not only once, but many times, in the context of various levels and complexes of the dreamer's psyche.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. chapter 6, "The Dream-Work", section b., "The work of displacement".&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was later borrowed for a variety of other realms of thought.

==In analytic philosophy==

In contemporary [[analytic philosophy]] an event or state of affairs is said to be ''overdetermined'' if it has two or more distinct, [[sufficient causes]].   In philosophy of mind, the famous case of overdetermination is called mental-physical causal overdetermination. If we accept that a mental state (M) is realized by a physical state (P). And M can cause another mental state (M*) or another physical state (P*). Then, nomologically speaking, P can cause M* or P* too. In this way, M* or P* is both determined by M and P. In other words, both M* and P* are overdetermined. Since either M or P is sufficient for M* or P*, the problem of mental-physical causal overdetermination is the causal redundancy. 

Whereas there may unproblematically be recognised many different ''necessary'' conditions of the event's occurrence, no two distinct events may lay claim to be sufficient conditions, since this would lead to overdetermination. A much used example is that of [[firing squad]]s, the members of which simultaneously firing at and 'killing' their targets. Apparently, no one member can be said to have caused the victims' deaths, since he or she would have been killed anyway. Another example is that Billy and Suzy each throw a rock through a window, and either rock alone could have shattered the window. In this case, similar to the example of firing squads, Billy and Suzy ''together'' shatter the window and the result is not overdetermined. Or, we can say, even if these two examples are a kind of overdetermination, this kind of overdetermination is benign.

There are many problems of overdetermination. First, overdetermination is problematic in particular from the viewpoint of a standard [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] understanding of causation, according to which an event is the cause of another event if and only if the latter would not have occurred, had the former not occurred. In order to employ this formula to actual complex situations, implicit or explicit conditions need to be accepted to be circumstantial, since the list of counterfactually acceptable causes would otherwise be impractically long (e.g. the Earth's continued existence could be said to be the (necessary) cause of one drinking one's coffee). Unless a circumstance-clause is included, the putative cause to which one wishes to draw attention could never be considered sufficient, and hence not comply with the counterfactual analysis. Second, overdetermination is problematic in that we do not know how to explain where the extra causation "comes from" and "goes". This makes overdetermination mysterious.

==Richards and literature==

The [[New Critic]] [[I. A. Richards]] used the idea of overdetermination to explain the importance of [[ambiguity]] in [[rhetoric]], the [[philosophy of language]], and [[literary criticism]].

==Althusser and structuralist Marxism==

The [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist philosopher]] [[Louis Althusser]] imported the concept into [[Marxist political theory]] in an influential essay, "Contradiction and overdetermination." Drawing from both Freud and [[Mao Zedong]], Althusser used the idea of overdetermination as a way of thinking about the multiple, often opposed, forces active at once in any political situation, without falling into an overly simple idea of these forces being simply "contradictory."  Brewster, in Althusser et al.'s ''[[Reading Capital]]'' defines overdetermination as such:

''"the representation of dream thoughts in images privileged by their condensation of a number of thoughts in a single image (condensation), or by the transference of psychic energy from  a particularly potent thought to apparently trivial things ... [For Althusser] overdetermination of a contradiction is the reflection in it of its conditions of existence within the complex whole."''

An instance of a popular riot calling for revolution could exemplify overdetermination.  The event has to it, in capitalist culture, an over-application (determination) of agitation. The determinant contradictions (the reasons for popular revolt) are not addressed and so their great mass is "displaced" onto the singular event.

A '''piper diagram''' is a graphical representation of the [[chemistry]] of a [[water]] [[Sample (material)|sample]] or samples.

The [[cation]]s and [[anion]]s are shown by separate [[ternary plot]]s. The apexes of the cation plot are [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] and [[sodium]] plus [[potassium]] cations. The apexes of the anion plot are [[sulfate]], [[chloride]] and [[carbonate]] plus [[hydrogen carbonate]] anions. The two ternary plots are then projected onto a diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Piper, A.M.|title=A Graphic Procedure in the Geochemical Interpretation of Water Analysis|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|location=Washington D.C.|year=1953|oclc=37707555|id=[[ASIN]] [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0007HRZ36 B0007HRZ36] &lt;!--ASIN is not valid on amazon.com, but is on amazon.co.uk--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The diamond is a [[Transformation matrix|matrix transformation]] of a graph of the anions ([[sulfate]] + [[chloride]]/ total anions) and cations ([[sodium]] + [[potassium]]/total cations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=MHPT.BAS: a computer program for modified Hill–Piper diagram for classification of ground water |doi=10.1016/S0098-3004(98)00083-1 |first=N.

The required matrix transformation of the anion/cation graph is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) &amp; \sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) &amp; 0 \\ -2\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) &amp; 2\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The piper diagram is suitable for comparing the ionic composition of a set of water samples, but does not lend itself to spatial comparisons. For geographical applications, the [[Stiff diagram]] and [[Maucha diagram]] are more applicable, because they can be used as markers on a map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Velasco | first1 = V. | last2 = Tubau | first2 = I. | last3 = Vázquez-Suñè | first3 = E. | last4 = Gogu | first4 = R. | last5 = Gaitanaru | first5 = D. | last6 = Alcaraz | first6 = M. | last7 = Serrano-Juan | first7 = A. | last8 = Fernàndez-Garcia | first8 = D. | last9 = Garrido | first9 = T. | last10 = Fraile | first10 = J. | last11 = Sanchez-Vila | first11 = X. | last12 = Sep | first12 =  | year = 2014 | title = GIS-based hydrogeochemical analysis tools (QUIMET) | doi = 10.1016/j.cageo.2014.04.013 | journal = Computers &amp; Geosciences | volume = 70 | issue = | pages = 164–180 | bibcode = 2014CG.....70..164V }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colour coding of the background of the Piper diagram allows linking Piper Diagrams and maps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peeters|first=Luk|date=2014-01-01|title=A Background Color Scheme for Piper Plots to Spatially Visualize Hydrochemical Patterns|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gwat.12118/abstract|journal=Groundwater|language=en|volume=52|issue=1|pages=2–6|doi=10.1111/gwat.12118|issn=1745-6584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the field called Human Systems Intervention, process consultation is a philosophy of helping, a general theory and methodology of intervening ([[Edgar Schein|Schein]], Process Consultations, 1992 revisited). 

A process consultant is a highly qualified professional that has insights into and understands the psychosocial dynamics of working with various client systems such as whole organizations, groups, and individuals. 

Given the complex nature of intervening, a process consultant's expertise includes the following (and many other) aspects:
a)	works concomitantly with groups and individuals (managers/directors) towards a larger change process such as strategic visioning, strategic planning, etc.
b)	based on the context, selects from a variety of methods, tools and change theories a 'facilitative intervention' that will most benefit the client system;
c)	stays aware of covert organizational processes, group dynamics, and interpersonal issues;

==Role in Organizational Development==

In [[organization development]], a process consultant is a specialized type of consultant who acts as a [[facilitator]] to help groups deal with issues involving the process in a meeting, rather than with the actual tasks themselves.
==Role in Small Group Development==
A process consultant may be used at any time during the [[Stages of Group Development]]. Occasionally, a process consultant is used when a group is either in its formative stage, or normative stage. However, more often than not, they participate when the group is in [[:wikt:conflict|conflict]].

==Role in Conflict Resolution==
Often a group finds itself in conflict over [[fact]]s, [[goal]]s, [[Scientific method|methods]] or [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. It is the role of the process consultant to help the group reach [[consensus]] over the type of conflict it faces.

Once the type of conflict is identified, the process consultant then helps the group work through the steps required to break the impasse.

It is important to note that the process consultant's role is not to solve the problem, but to help the group solve its own problem.  The reason for this is because it is the group, not the consultant who will have to live with the [[Consequentialism|consequences]] of its decision.

==Role in Conflict Management==

Occasionally, due to the nature of conflict, the process consultant may need to guide the group toward [[conflict management]] rather than [[conflict resolution]].

==Techniques Used==
Initially a process consultant will not lead or participate in a group meeting, but rather will act as an [[observation|observer]]. During this time, they observe the [[group dynamics]] to determine what [[interpersonal]] relationships may contribute to the group's issues.

At some point, s/he will begin to actively participate in the meeting, by asking clarifying questions or [[paraphrasing]].  Eventually, s/he will make his/her observations known by giving the group [[feedback]].

==Education Required==
To enter this field, a background in [[psychology]] and [[small group learning]] is helpful. Experience in reading [[body language]] and possessing [[Analytical skills]] is also useful. However, receiving some training in [[experiential education]] will probably be the most beneficial.

[[File:The Raven Flood Totem. - NARA - 298052.jpg|thumb|The Raven sits on a really jumpy frog after having rescued children from a flood.]]

'''Raven Tales''' are the traditional people and animals [[creation stories]] of the [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] but are also found among [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]]-speaking peoples and others.  Raven stories exist in nearly all of the First Nations throughout the region but are most prominent in the tales of the [[Tlingit]] and [[Tahltan]] people.

Raven and eagle are known by many different names by many different peoples and is an important figure amongst written and [[oral history|verbal stories]].  His tales are passed down through the generations of [[storytelling|story tellers]] of the people and are of cultural and historical significance.  It's important to note that, from some storytellers' perspective, [[Mythologies of the indigenous peoples of North America|Native myths]] such as the Raven Tales, as opposed to tall tales and little stories for children, are not entertainment and are cultural property of the clan or individual that the story originates from.  It is customary that others should not tell stories that are owned by another clan, especially if they do not live in the same area.&lt;ref name=ownership&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giese|first1=Paula|title=Who Owns the Stories&amp;nbsp;— A Letter to Eldrbarry|url=http://www.eldrbarry.net/rabb/rvn/whoowns.htm|accessdate=1 September 2014|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While each culture's stories of the Raven are different, there are even those that share the same title; certain attributes of Raven remain the same.  The Raven is always a [[Legendary creature|magical creature]] able to take the form of human, animal, even inanimate objects.  He is a keeper of secrets, and a [[trickster god|trickster]] often focused on satisfying his own [[gluttony]] for whatever he desires.  His stories tell of how worldly things came to be or offer suggestion to children on how to behave.&lt;ref name="boas1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boas |first=Franz |authorlink=Franz Boas |date=October–December 1914 |title=Mythology and Folk-Tales of the North American Indians |jstor=534740 |journal=[[The Journal of American Folklore]] |volume=27 |issue=106 |pages=374 |doi=10.2307/534740 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|394–395}}  Raven's creative nature shows itself through circumstance rather than intent, through the desire to satisfy his own needs, rather than any [[altruistic]] principles.  Raven is both the protagonist among the stories of some groups, and the antagonist of others; he is a hero and an amusement.

Tales that feature the Raven as the hero are specific to areas in the north of the continent such as northern [[British Columbia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iToLLxlIIiQC&amp;pg=PA58 | title=Native American Culture | publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group | author=Kuiper, Kathleen | year=2011 | pages=58 | isbn=978-1615301386}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Alaska]] and their peoples,&lt;ref name="boas1"/&gt;{{rp|387}} such as the [[Tsimshian]]&lt;ref name="boas1"/&gt;{{rp|397}} and the Haida.  [[Kutkh|Similar tales]] appear in [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] cultures in the north-east of Asia and it is probable that they are influenced by Native American stories.&lt;ref name="boas1"/&gt;{{rp|383–384}}

The [[Haida people|Haida]] First Nation credits Raven with finding the first humans  hiding in a clam shell; he brought them berries and salmon.  The [[Sioux]] tell of how a [[common raven|white raven]] used to warn [[american bison|buffalo]] of approaching hunters.  Eventually an angry shaman caught the bird and threw it into a fire, turning it black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nyxks|title=How The Raven Became Black|url=http://pathwalkers.wordpress.com/2000/11/27/how-the-raven-became-black/|accessdate=8 September 2014|date=27 November 2000|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200251/http://pathwalkers.wordpress.com/2000/11/27/how-the-raven-became-black/|archivedate=10 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published source|date=October 2014}}

==Common features==
While Raven tales tell the origins of human beings, they do not address the origins of organized society. In tales which mirror development and organization of Native American societies, the hero is often humanity itself. Raven tales do not offer a detailed picture about the social relations and realities of life.&lt;ref name="boas1"/&gt;{{rp|395–397}}

===Athabaskan===
{{further|Athabaskan languages}}
Athabaskan is the language family of several contiguous dialects spoken by various peoples in Western Canada and the American West.  They can be further subdivided into the [[Northern Athabaskan]], [[Pacific Coast Athabaskan]], and [[Southern Athabaskan]] subregions.

These groups lived in one of the 3 Athabaskan regions.

====Cahto====
The [[Cahto]] are an [[indigenous Californian]] group of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The Kato lived farthest south of all the Athapascans in California, occupying Cahto Valley and [[Long Valley Caldera|Long Valley]], and in general the country south of [[Blue Rock Springs Creek|Blue Rock]] and between the headwaters of the two main branches of [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]]. The Kato language is one of  four [[Athabascan language|Athabaskan]] languages that were spoken in northwestern California.

One version of the Raven creation story is that of the Cahto in California.&lt;ref name=goddard&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goddard|first1=Pliny Earle|authorlink=Pliny Earle Goddard|author2=Bill Ray|title=Kato texts|journal=Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnography|volume=8|issue=3| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8k6AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=24 August 2012|year=1909|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In one variant, Raven is taught by his father, Kit-ka'ositiyi-qa, to be a creator, but Raven is unsatisfied with the result. He creates the world but is unable to give it light or water.  On hearing that light could be found hidden in a far-off land, Raven decides to travel there and steal it.  In the house of light, he finds a young woman living with her father and plays the first of many tricks.  He turns himself into a small speck of dirt, slips into her drinking water, and is swallowed.  The daughter becomes pregnant and she gave birth to an unusual and fussy child who cries constantly and demands to touch one of the bundles which has been stored hanging from the walls.  The child is given one of the bags to quiet him, but when he tires of playing with it, he lets it go, and it floats away from him and disappears through the [[smoke hole]].  Once it reaches the sky the bundle comes undone and scatters stars across the sky.  When the child cries to have it back again he is given the second bundle to play with and lets it float away through the hole in the ceiling, thus releasing the moon.  It all happens again with the third and last bundle, which flies away and becomes sunlight.  After bringing light to the whole world, he too flies out through the smoke hole.&lt;ref name="thompson1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Stith|title=Tales of the North American Indians|date=1929|publisher=Harvard Univ.

====Tahltan====
Locally among the [[Tahltan]] people, their customs and livelihoods varied widely as they were often widely separated and would have to endure varying conditions depending on their locality.&lt;ref name=sturtevant&gt;{{cite book|last1=editor|first1=William C.

Raven is considered to be the protagonist hero against these evil ancestors.&lt;ref name="sams"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Raven cycle|journal=SAMS Anthology|url=http://www.samstudies.org/anthology/library/periodicals/afs/jaf/32-124/a/01|accessdate=3 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903141339/http://www.samstudies.org/anthology/library/periodicals/afs/jaf/32-124/a/01|archivedate=3 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  Tahltan stories, Raven is referred to as Big-Crow (''Tse'sketco'' or ''tceski'tco'', "big raven" - from ''tceski'a'', "raven").&lt;ref name="teit"/&gt;{{rp|198}}

=====The Birth of Raven=====
They claim that Big-Crow was born miraculously as the youngest of many brothers in the northern [[Tlingit]] country and was raised speaking the local language.&lt;ref name="teit"/&gt;{{rp|198}}  He was separated from his father at birth and his father is never spoken of in all of their stories.  Raven was born, the third child of a woman whose previous two boys were killed by her uncle.  Each time the woman gave birth, her uncle would offer to teach them to hunt once they were old enough; each time he would take them out on a canoe and trick them, he would instruct the boys to sit on the edge of the canoe, at which point he would rock the canoe, forcing them to fall into the water where he would leave them to drown.&lt;ref name="teit"/&gt;{{rp|199}}

But her third child was Raven who took well to carving.  Just as he'd done 2 times before, her uncle asked if he could teach Raven how to hunt after he'd grown a few years.  Several times she refused her uncle until Raven insisted that she allow him to go.  So they went out to sea and the same scenario played out.  Raven fell into the water but rather than drown, he took one of the toy canoes he had carved and made it grow into a full size canoe.  He went straight back to his mother and told of what his uncle had done.&lt;ref name="teit"/&gt;{{rp|200}}

Twice more the uncle tried to drown Raven in the same manner but Raven outsmarted him each time until the uncle gave up and no longer took Raven hunting but would go alone.&lt;ref name="teit"/&gt;{{rp|200}}

As Raven grew into a man, he met the uncle's wife where he tried to play with her.  He tickled the girl and two birds flew out from under her arms, a bluejay and a woodpecker; and the girl died.  When the uncle returned from his hunt, he saw that his wife had died and he intended to kill Raven again, but this time in rage rather than trickery.  But once again, Raven escaped with his canoe carvings.  But when Raven escaped this time, he did not return home and his journey began; never to return to his home.&lt;ref name="teit"/&gt;{{rp|200}}

He starting off travelling by canoe along the seashore all alone but would stop whenever he came upon a village.  When he met people whom he saw take advantage of others or use their power for evil, he would kill in his efforts to deprive them of power.&lt;ref name="teit"/&gt;{{rp|199}}

Raven travelled for many years along the coast of the Tlingit territory, first travelling south, having started in the north until he had gone so far south, beyond Tlingit territory until he reached the Mink people at which point he turned around and continued back the other direction.  He did this north south, south north journey for several years.  Not until his work along the coast was done, did he head inland along the [[Stikine]] river all the way to its source.  He also traveled along the [[Nass River|Nass]], [[Skeena River|Skeena]], and [[Taku River|Taku]] Rivers and all of their many streams never staying in one place for very long and never traveling far off from the water ways.  Through his inland journeys he met the [[Kaska people|Kaska]], the [[Haida people|Haida]], and other nations to the east.&lt;ref name="sams"/&gt;

Later in life, when Raven had done all the work he could do, he travelled back out to the coastal regions guided by the setting sun until he disappeared mysteriously.  The only suggestion is that he may have gone to live with the Kanu'gu and other ancient gods on an island far out into the ocean where they believed weather was created from.&lt;ref name="sams"/&gt;

===Inuit===
The [[Inuit]] are native to the [[Canadian Arctic]] and [[Greenland]]. Among Inuit tradition the owl, fish, and raven are of greatest prominence.  Ravens are also common in the artwork of the Inuit and they have several stories that tell of Raven's birth which is often juxtaposed with the owl with whom Raven shared a deep friendship.&lt;ref name="skinner"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inuit Views of Nature|first1=Kelly|last1=Skinner|first2=Laura|last2=Brill|publisher=St. Lawrence University|url=http://www.stlawu.edu/gallery/exhibitions/f/11nipirasait/skinner-brill.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

The [[Inuit]] say that Raven was born out of the darkness. He was weak and lost. As he began traveling aimlessly experiencing the world, he realized that he was the Raven Father, Creator of All Life. Once he realized who he was, he gathered up his strength and flew out of the darkness to a new place which he called earth, but he was still alone, so he decided to create plants. As he flew around exploring this new world, he came upon a man whom the legend claims was the first of the Inuit people. Raven fed the man and taught the man to respect the world around him. Soon after, a woman came to be and Raven taught the both of them how to cloth themselves, build shelter, and make canoes to travel the water. As the two bred and spawned children, Raven cared for their children and educated them as he had done before.&lt;ref name="eco"/&gt;

===Haida===
[[File:Raven and the First Men, left side.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Reid]]'s ''Raven and The First Men'' (1980), [[UBC Museum of Anthropology]], depicts a scene from the Haida creation myth. The Raven represents both the creator and trickster figures, common to many mythologies.]]
The [[Haida people|Haida]] people live in [[British Columbia]].  To The Haida, Raven was the Bringer of Light and before Raven the world was nothing more than a gigantic flood.  Raven was the Maker of Things, as well as the Transformer, Magician and Healer.&lt;ref name="eco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ravenecoventures.com/aboutstory.php?lang=eng|title=The Story of the Raven|website=Raven Eco Ventures|year=2004|access-date=4 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222115738/http://www.ravenecoventures.com/aboutstory.php?lang=eng|archive-date=22 December 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Raven was bored of the world being nothing but water and decided to fly as the waters receded.  Once Raven became hungry, land was formed so he could land and find food.  It was at this point he noticed strange sounds coming from a gigantic clam shell.  Confused as to the sound, Raven decided he would begin singing to the clam shell in response to its sound, hoping to calm it with his pleasant sounds.  Raven did this because he was a beautiful singer.  Finally, a small creature emerged from the clam shell.  It had long black hair, a round head, brown smooth skin and two legs like Raven but no feathers.  This was the first of the First People.&lt;ref name="kenny"&gt;{{cite AV media|medium=Keynote presentation|accessdate=4 September 2014|first1=Kenny|last1=Carolyn|date=June 1994|series=Our Legacy: Work and Play|place=Annual conference of the American Association for Music Therapy|title=Connections: Integrating our Work and play|url=https://essexmyth.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/haida-talk.doc|volume=4|number=2|format=DOC}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he got bored with them, he considered returning them to their shell, but opted instead to find female counterparts of these male beings. The raven found some female humans trapped in a [[chiton]], freed them, and was entertained as the two sexes met and began to interact. The Raven felt responsible and very protective of them, thus many Haida myths and legends often suggest the raven as a provider to mankind and combine the roles of the creator and the trickster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prezi.com/mqtalthcz5xg/raven-creation/|title=Raven Creation|accessdate=8 September 2014|first1=Darren A.|last1=Svitko|first2=Jessica A|last2=Rosado|publisher=Prezi Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other versions that tells of a different creation.  When the earth was only sky and water with a single reef that rose out of the water where all of the great beings lived with the greatest of them living at the highest point on the reef and the weakest of them living at the bottom.  But Raven flew above them all and could never find a place to land.  For that reason he decided to travel to the sky country where he met the Chief's daughter who had recently had a child.  While it was dark, Raven possessed the baby and intended to take its place as Raven Child.&lt;ref name="eco"/&gt;

One ancient story told on [[Haida Gwaii]] tells about how Raven helped to bring the Sun, Moon, Stars, Fresh Water, and Fire to the world:&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Ella E.: ''Indian Legends of the Pacific Northwest'', [[University of California Press]], 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Long ago, near the beginning of the world, Gray Eagle was the guardian of the Sun, Moon and Stars, of fresh water, and of fire. Gray Eagle hated people so much that he kept these things hidden. People lived in darkness, without fire and without fresh water.

Gray Eagle had a beautiful daughter, and Raven fell in love with her. In the beginning, Raven was a snow-white bird, and as such, he pleased Gray Eagle's daughter. She invited him to her father's longhouse.

When Raven saw the Sun, Moon and stars, and fresh water hanging on the sides of Eagle's lodge, he knew what he should do. He watched for his chance to seize them when no one was looking. He stole all of them, and a brand of fire also, and flew out of the longhouse through the smoke hole. As soon as Raven got outside he hung the Sun up in the sky. It made so much light that he was able to fly far out to an island in the middle of the ocean. When the Sun set, he fastened the Moon up in the sky and hung the stars around in different places. By this new light he kept on flying, carrying with him the fresh water and the brand of fire he had stolen.

He flew back over the land. When he had reached the right place, he dropped all the water he had stolen. It fell to the ground and there became the source of all the fresh-water streams and lakes in the world. Then Raven flew on, holding the brand of fire in his bill. The smoke from the fire blew back over his white feathers and made them black. When his bill began to burn, he had to drop the firebrand. It struck rocks and hid itself within them. That is why, if you strike two stones together, sparks of fire will drop out.

Raven's feathers never became white again after they were blackened by the smoke from the firebrand. That is why Raven is now a black bird.}}

Amongst the [[Sierra Miwok|Northern Miwok]] of what is now [[Central California]] the story of Raven begins with a world covered in water except for a single mountain top where people had gathered during the flooding of the world.  As the waters receded the people tried to come down from the mountain but the land was so soft with mud that those that tried would sink into the ground.  Wherever a person sank, a raven would come and stand on that spot.  One raven at each hole.

===Puget Sound===
Another raven story from the [[Puget Sound]] region describes the "Raven" as having originally lived in the land of spirits (literally ''bird land'') that existed before the world of humans. One day the Raven became so bored with ''bird land'' that he flew away, carrying a stone in his beak. When the Raven became tired of carrying the stone and dropped it, the stone fell into the ocean and expanded until it formed the firmament on which humans now live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John|title=The raven tattoo on my right leg|url=http://people.tribe.net/carpenternj/blog/91f6acb2-835e-4086-bbc2-994e637b98de|accessdate=8 September 2014|date=26 November 2011|quote=A raven story from the Puget Sound region describes the "Raven" as having originally lived in the land of spirits (literally bird land)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910202842/http://people.tribe.net/carpenternj/blog/91f6acb2-835e-4086-bbc2-994e637b98de|archive-date=10 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published source|date=October 2014}}

===Quileute===

The [[Quileute]] are a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people in western [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state in the United States, currently numbering approximately 2000. Their language belongs to the [[Chimakuan languages|Chimakuan]] family of languages.

The native name for Raven among the Quileute is Báyaḳ (''By''-yuhk).&lt;ref name="quileuteschool"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Raven Tales:Traditional Quileute Stories of Bayak, the Trickster|last1=Woodruff, Sr|first1=Fred|editor1=Jensen, Vickie|editor2=Powell, Jay|url=http://www.quileutenation.org/images/stories/culture/raventales.pdf|format=PDF|website=Quileute River Classroom|publisher=Quileute Tribal School of the Quileute Nation|location=La Push, Washington|access-date=3 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924083755/http://www.quileutenation.org/images/stories/culture/raventales.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

Quileute Indians were the southernmost group along the Pacific Coast whose mythology included several stories of the Raven.  Though the Quileute's primary protagonist was not the Raven, but Kweeti, whose stories can be very closely related to similar stories of the [[Tlingit]] involving the Raven.&lt;ref name="quileuteschool"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

The Raven, amongst the Quileute people, is used to tell scary stories to children of how Raven's feet {{rp|226}}&lt;ref name="livingston32"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Journal of American Folk-Lore|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|volume=32|issue=124|pages=251|first1=Livingston|last1=Farrand|first2=Theresa|last2=Mayer|editor=Boas, Franz|date=1920|doi=10.2307/534981|jstor=534981}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|259}} look the way they do; others pursued children to be generous rather than selfish, or to be true to themselves and work hard rather than trying to take shortcuts. In their stories Raven is often punished, or must witness suffering by the people whom he cares for as a result of his trickery.&lt;ref name="quileuteschool"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

In the Quileute story of Duskeah&lt;ref name="livingston32"/&gt;{{rp|255}}

In the first story of "Kweeti" the story goes "At [[Neah Bay]] he taught them to fish, as all men do. He traversed the whole world." which is compared to the Tlingit story "Raven teaches people their mode of life".&lt;ref name="livingston32"/&gt;{{rp|252}}

Again in the story of the "Kweeti and the Wolves", "Finally, when the wolves had all but caught him, Kweeti urinated and made Ozetta Lake." which is compared to "Raven Creates Rivers".&lt;ref name="livingston32"/&gt;{{rp|254}}

===Tlingit===
[[File:Tlingit-map.png|thumb|right|Tlingit and neighboring peoples]]&lt;!-- geography of tribes to each other is important --&gt;
&lt;!--[[File:Tlingit dancers.jpg|thumb|right|Tlingit tribal dancers dancing around [[totem pole]]s featuring Raven]]--&gt;

[[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] territory is in Southeast Alaska.&lt;ref name=tlingit-geo&gt;{{cite web|title=The Raven Story|url=http://www.echospace.org/articles/131/sections/197.html|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of their territory is in present-day Canada.

The Tlingit call Raven Katce'de but it is disputed whether this derives from the name of another place in the region named Kate, meaning "cedar-bark" or from Tlingitka, signifying "man" or "people"&lt;ref name="teit"/&gt;{{rp|207}}

In Tlingit culture, there are two different raven characters which can be identified, although they are not always clearly differentiated. One is the creator raven, responsible for bringing the world into being and who is sometimes considered to be the individual who brought light to the darkness. The other is the childish raven, always selfish, sly, conniving, and hungry. When the [[Great Spirit]] created all things he kept them separate and stored in cedar boxes. The Great Spirit gifted these boxes to the animals who existed before humans. When the animals opened the boxes all the things that comprise the world came into being. The boxes held such things as mountains, fire, water, wind and seeds for all the plants. One such box, which was given to [[Seagull]], contained all the light of the world. Seagull coveted his box and refused to open it, clutching it under his wing.  All the people asked Raven to persuade Seagull to open it and release the light.  Despite begging, demanding, flattering and trying to trick him into opening the box, Seagull still refused.  Raven became angry and frustrated, and stuck a thorn in Seagull's foot.  Raven pushed the thorn in deeper until the pain caused Seagull to drop the box.  Then out of the box came the sun, moon and stars that brought light to the world and allowed the first day to begin.&lt;ref name=swanton&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swanton|first1=John|title=Tlingit Myths and Texts|journal=Smithsonian Institution.

In one version Raven leads its owner to believe he has soiled his bed in his sleep and threatens to shame him unless he shares his water with Raven.  In another version Raven puts ash on his tongue to fool the owner to believe his extreme thirst is unquenched.  Instead of drinking the water Raven collects it in a seal's bladder hidden under his clothes and flees with all of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulletin|url=https://si-pddr.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/15466/bulletin1721960smit.pdf.txt;jsessionid=4925B968BFDDF2F0BD32104C4228C24E?sequence=2|publisher=Bureau of American Ethnology|accessdate=3 September 2014|page=72|quote=Emmons also published petro-glyphs on Lisiansky Bay, Baranof Island, where the totemic crestsare organized to illustrate the Raven myth of the theft of water|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904001157/https://si-pddr.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/15466/bulletin1721960smit.pdf.txt;jsessionid=4925B968BFDDF2F0BD32104C4228C24E?sequence=2|archive-date=4 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tsimshian===
To the [[Tsimshian]], Raven, was known as Txamsem or ''ganhada'' or the Clever One and was accompanied by a brother named Lagabula or Lazy One.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Nancy J.|title=Ancient pathways, ancestral knowledge : ethnobotany and ecological wisdom of Indigenous peoples of northwestern North America|date=2014|pages=256, 259, 263, 273–278, 286, 288|isbn=9780773585409|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BpDdAwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two had been born in a kelp patch and adopted by a Chief's wife and a magical being from the region of [[Prince_Rupert,_British_Columbia|Prince Rupert]] Harbor.  At the time of their birth things such as daylight did not yet exist; only dusk.  Some records contradict this stating that they were of Gispaxloats origin, born of a Gispaxloats Chief who married a beautiful princess.&lt;ref name="vickers"&gt;{{cite thesis|type=Doctorate of Philosophy|title=Ayaawx (Ts'msyen ancestral law): The power of Transformation|date=1993|publisher=University of Victoria|url=http://dspace.library.uvic.ca:8080/bitstream/handle/1828/1299/AyaawxDec16.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86}}

Among their journeys, they traveled to a mountain at the head of the [[Nass River]].  Txamsem, who could transform into anything, and often took the form of a human or bird, turned himself into a pine needle and was consumed by the daughter of the Chief who guarded daylight.  She then gave birth to him as a baby and the baby cried incessantly to play with daylight.  As soon as it was given to the baby in the form of a playful ball, he transformed back into Raven and flew away with it.  He traveled back up the Nass River with daylight and released it; immediately lighting up the river and allowing it to spread all over the world.&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barbeau|first1=Marius|last2=Beynon|first2=William|editor1-last=Cove|editor1-first=John J.|editor2-last=MacDonald|editor2-first=George F.|title=Tsimshian narratives|date=1987|publisher=Directorate, Canadian Museum of Civilization|location=Ottawa|isbn=978-0660107615}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

The most prominent [[culture hero]] for many of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest is Raven.  There are numerous stories, widely distributed which focus on the Raven myth and his adventures to satisfy his insatiable desire to obtain whatever he wants.  The plot of most Raven tales, tell of how Raven is able to use force or trickery to obtain or motivate someone else to relinquish an object he desires.  Throughout his many stories, Raven claims daylight, water, fire, the oceans waves, the olachen, salmon, the soil, and even the weather.&lt;ref name=boas2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boas|first1=Franz|last2=Tate|first2=Henry W.|title=Tsimshian mythology|date=1916|issue=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjxDAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA721|accessdate=3 September 2014|series=Annual report of the Bureau of American Ethnology|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|618}}

Through the Raven tales, people are able to explain why their surrounding environment was the way it was by linking the Raven or his companions as the cause for why various things in the world come about.

Some stories account for the creation of dangerous animals which were transformed from inanimate objects(No 61. p 572), others suggest that men, animals and objects could be turned to stone.(nos89-93).  While other stories suggest how names were attributed to important landmarks, and how significant geographical features came about.

There is a vague mention that Raven was the ancestor of the [[Ganhada|Raven Clan]], but there are no other direct references between Raven and the ancestry of the Indian people.&lt;ref name="boas2"/&gt;{{rp|619}}

The raven is not a traditional [[fetishism|fetish]] of the [[Zuni people|Zuni]] but he, along with the Macaw play a part in the Zuni story of migration and is carved often in their artwork, typically carved from [[black marble]] though not exclusively.

The Zuni consider Raven to be a prankster but without negative characteristics which they associate with the [[Coyote (mythology)|coyote]].  The Raven's greatest traits are his ability to assist the people in overcoming their failures by offering gentle reminders that anything people have the courage to face, thus too do they have the power to transform.&lt;ref name="zunifetish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zuni Fetish Meanings|url=http://www.zunispirits.com/2006/zunitopics/zunifetishmeanings.html|last1=Riggs|first1=Darlene Meader|series=The Zuni Fetish Story|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many [[Native Americans in children's literature|children's]] and picture books that recount traditional Raven Tales. These new versions have been criticized for portraying a much "nicer" Raven with little left from the original greedy [[trickster]]. In some stories Raven acts for the good of people and not for himself. In other stories Raven refuses to use force, and sexual themes are edited out. Trickery is in some instances substituted for magic. These newer tales are also written in conventions of Western rather than Native American literature thus conveying the message that native storytellers' ability or style is inferior.&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msu.edu/user/singere/fakelore.html|title=Fakelore, Multiculturalism, and the Ethics of Children's Literature|last=Singer|first=Eliot A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, The [[Smithsonian Institution]] sponsored [[Chris Kientz]] to develop a series of half-hour animated television programs targeted at school children as an entertaining way of educating kids on aboriginal folklore.  The show ''[[Raven Tales (TV series)|Raven Tales]]'' was produced by New Machine Studios working with producer Winadzi James and aired for two seasons with a total of 26 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Award-Winning Animated Series|url=http://www.raventales.com/|publisher=RavenTales (Alberta) Ltd|accessdate=1 September 2014|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raven Tales Episode Guide|url=http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/sc/web/series/731/raven-tales|website=Smithsonian Channel|publisher=SNI/SI Networks L.L.C|accessdate=1 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903144001/http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/sc/web/series/731/raven-tales|archive-date=3 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Matt Dembicki produced an anthological graphic novel of the trickster stories, making sure to maintain the cultural integrity of the stories with the help of 21 Native American  story-tellers who were paired directly with several graphic designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Higgins|first1=Jim|title='Trickster Tales': Gladstone, Indian storytellers team with artists|url=http://missoulian.com/lifestyles/territory/trickster-tales-gladstone-indian-storytellers-team-with-artists/article_f517b738-7016-11df-a81d-001cc4c03286.html|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1452">Referent power is gained by a leader who has strong interpersonal relationship skills.

Referent power, as an aspect of personal power,  becomes particularly important as organizational leadership is increasingly about collaboration and influence rather than command and control.

In an organizational setting, referent power is most easily seen in the charismatic leader who excels in making others feel comfortable in his or her presence. Staff typically express their excitement about work in terms of their attraction to their leader's personal characteristics and charisma. The reason they commit to their work is because of the leader's likability and they base their self-esteem and sense of accomplishment on their leader's approval.

'''Religious abuse''' is [[abuse]] administered under the guise of [[religion]], including [[harassment]] or [[humiliation]], which may result in [[psychological trauma]]. Religious abuse may also include misuse of religion for [[Selfishness|selfish]], [[Secularism|secular]], or [[Ideology|ideological]] ends such as the abuse of a clerical position.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Wright, ''Religious Abuse'', Wood Lake Publishing Inc., 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological abuse==
One specific meaning of the term ''religious abuse'' refers to [[psychological manipulation]] and harm inflicted on a person by using the teachings of their religion. This is perpetrated by members of the same or similar faith, and includes the use of a position of authority within the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiritwatch.org/relabdef.htm |title=What Religious Abuse Is About |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most often directed at children and emotionally vulnerable adults, and motivations behind such abuse vary, but can be either well-intentioned or malicious.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite book |author=Wright, Keith T. |title=Religious Abuse: A Pastor Explores the Many Ways Religion Can Hurt As Well As Heal |publisher=Northstone Publishing |location=Kelowna, B.C |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=1-896836-47-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even well-intentioned religious abuse can have long-term psychological consequences, such as the victim developing [[phobia]]s or long-term [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. They may have a sense of shame that persists even after they leave the religion. A person can also be manipulated into avoiding a beneficial action (such as a medical treatment) or to engage in a harmful behavior.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

In his book ''Religious Abuse'', pastor Keith Wright describes an example of such abuse. When he was a child, his [[Christian Scientist]] mother became very ill and eventually was convinced to seek medical treatment at an inpatient facility. Members of her church went to the treatment center to convince her to trust prayer rather than treatment, and to leave. She died shortly thereafter. While the church members may not have had any malicious intent, their use of their religion's teachings to manipulate Wright's mother ultimately resulted in her death.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

==Against children==
Religiously-based psychological abuse of children can involve using teachings to subjugate children through fear, or indoctrinating the child in the beliefs of their particular religion whilst suppressing other perspectives. Psychologist Jill Mytton describes this as crushing the child's chance to form a personal morality and belief system; it makes them utterly reliant on their religion and/or parents, and they never learn to [[Critical thinking|reflect critically]] on information they receive. Similarly, the use of fear and a judgmental environment (such as the concept of [[Hell]]) to control the child can be traumatic.&lt;ref name=Mytton&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXA7GA9yntc |title=YouTube - Jill Mytton Interview - Richard Dawkins |work= |accessdate=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical abuse==
Physical abuse in a religious context often takes the form of beatings, illegal confinement, neglect, near drowning or even murder in the belief that the child is [[Demonic possession|possessed by evil spirits]], practicing sorcery or [[witchcraft]], or has committed some kind of [[sin]] that warrants punishment. Such extreme cases are, though, rare.

In 2012, the United Kingdom's [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] instituted a new action plan to investigate the issue of faith-based abuse after several high-profile murders, such as that Kristy Bamu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/couple-guilty-of-horrific-witchcraft-murder-7468465.html|title=Couple guilty of horrific witchcraft murder|date=1 March 2012|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a term of 10 years, [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]] conducted 83 investigations into allegations of abuse with faith-based elements and feared there were even more that were unreported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = BBC News - Witchcraft-based child abuse: Action plan launched | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19248144 | publisher =  | accessdate = 15 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious violence==
{{Main|Religious violence}}
Religious violence and extremism (also called communal violence&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, D.L. (2000) The Deadly Ethnic Riot. University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA&lt;/ref&gt;) is a term that covers all phenomena where [[religion]] is either the subject or object of violent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Wellman|first= James|author2=Tokuno, Kyoko |year= 2004|title= Is Religious Violence Inevitable?|publisher=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2004.00234.x|journal= Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume= 43|pages= 291|issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] (c.46–120 AD) mentions the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]]'s ritual burning of small children, as do [[Tertullian]], [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Philo]]. [[Livy]] and [[Polybius]] do not. The [[Hebrew Bible]] also mentions what appears to be child sacrifice practised at a place called the [[Tophet]] (''roasting place'') by the [[Canaan]]ites, and by some Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Brown  | first = Shelby  | title = Late Carthaginian Child Sacrifice and Sacrificial Monuments in their Mediterranean Context  | publisher = Sheffield Academic Press  | year = 1991  | location = Sheffield   | pages =  | url =  | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacrificial victims were often infants. "The slaughtering of newborn babies may be considered a common event in many cultures" including the [[Eskimo]], the [[Polynesians]], the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], the [[Scandinavia]]ns, and various indigenous peoples of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africa]], [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|the Americas]] and [[Indigenous Australians|Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Grotstein | first = James S. | authorlink =  | title = Who is the dreamer who dreams the dream?| publisher = The Analytic Press, Relational Perspectives Book Series Volume 19 edition | year = 2000  | location = NJ| pages = 247, 242  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiation rites===
{{Main|Initiation rite}}
[[Artificial deformation of the skull]] predates written history and dates back as far as 45,000 BCE, as evidenced by two [[Neanderthal]] skulls found in [[Shanidar Cave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Trinkaus |first= Erik |date=April 1982|title= Artificial Cranial Deformation in the Shanidar 1 and 5 Neandertals|journal= Current Anthropology |volume= 23|issue= 2|pages= 198–199 |jstor= 2742361|doi= 10.1086/202808 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was usually started just after birth and continued until the desired shape was achieved.

In [[China]] some boys were castrated, with both the penis and scrotum cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Tompkins| first = Peter| title = The Eunuch and the Virgin: A Study of Curious Customs | publisher = Bramhall House | year = 1963  | location = NY| pages = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Ritual#Ritual actions|ritual actions]] have been described by [[anthropologists]]. [[Géza Róheim]] wrote about initiation rituals performed by Australian natives in which adolescent initiates were forced to drink [[blood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Róheim  | first = Géza | authorlink =  Géza Róheim | title =  Psychoanalysis and Anthropology | publisher =  International Universities Press| year =  1950| location =  NY| pages =  76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritual [[rape]] of young [[virgin]]s have been part of [[shaman]]istic practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =  Nevill | first =  Drury | authorlink =  | title =  The Elements of Shamanism | publisher =  Element| year =  1989| location =  Longmead| pages =  20| url =  | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern practices===
In some tribes rituals of [[Papua New Guinea]], an elder "picks out a sharp stick of cane and sticks it deep inside a boy's nostrils until he bleeds profusely into the stream of a pool, an act greeted by loud war cries."&lt;ref name="Sambia ritual" &gt;{{cite book  | last =   Herdt | first =  Gilbert | authorlink = Gilbert Herdt| title =  The Sambia: Ritual, Sexuality, and Change in Papua New Guinea (Case Studies in Cultural Anthropology) | publisher =  Wadsworth Publishing; 2 edition | year =  2005| location =  Longmead| page = 85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, when boys are initiated into puberty and manhood, they are expected to perform [[fellatio]] on the elders. "Not all initiates will participate in this ceremonial homosexual activity but, about five days later, several will have to perform fellatio several times."&lt;ref name="Sambia ritual" /&gt;

===Witch-hunts===
{{Further|Witch-hunt}}
{{Further|Witchcraft accusations against children in Africa}}

To this day, witch hunts, trials and accusations are still a real danger in some parts of the world. Trials result in violence against men, women and children, including murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/05/witches-feminism-books-kristin-j-sollee|title=Are witches the ultimate feminists?|last=Kelly|first=Kim|date=2017-07-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Gambia]], about 1,000 people accused of being witches were locked in government detention centers in March 2009, being beaten, forced to drink an unknown [[hallucinogenic]] potion, and confess to witchcraft, according to [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2009/03/gambia-hundreds-accused-e2809cwitchcrafte2809d-and-poisoned-government-campaign-20/|title=The Gambia: Hundreds accused of "witchcraft" and poisoned in government campaign|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/19/gambia-witchcraft-hallucinogenics|title=Gambian state kidnaps 1,000 villagers in mass purge of 'witchcraft'|last=Rice|first=Xan|date=2009-03-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania thousands of elderly Tanzanian women have been strangled, knifed to death and burned alive over the last two decades after being denounced as witches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tanzania-women-landrights/despite-murderous-attacks-tanzanias-witches-fight-for-land-idUSKBN16S2HU|title=Despite murderous attacks, Tanzania's 'witches' fight for land|date=21 March 2017|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritualistic abuse may also involve children accused of, and punished for, being purported witches in some [[Central Africa]]n areas.

===Psychohistorical explanation===
{{Main|Psychohistorical views on infanticide}}

A small number of academics subscribe to the theory of [[psychohistory]] and attribute the abusive rituals to the [[psychopathology|psychopathological]] [[projection (psychology)|projection]] of the perpetrators, especially the parents.&lt;ref name="EMOL"/&gt;&lt;!-- pp. 258-262 --&gt;&lt;ref name="OneCosmos"/&gt;&lt;!-- pp. 124-176 --&gt;

This ''psychohistorical'' model claims that practices of [[Tribal society|tribal societies]] sometimes included [[incest]] and the sacrifice, [[mutilation]], rape and [[torture]] of children, and that such activities were culturally acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=deMause |first=Lloyd  |authorlink=Lloyd deMause|title=Foundations of Psychohistory |url= |edition= |series= |date= January 1982  |publisher=Creative Roots Publishing  |location= |isbn=0-940508-01-X |oclc= |doi=  |pages=132–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Rascovsky  | first = A.  | title = Filicide: The Murder, Humiliation, Mutilation, Denigration and Abandonment of Children by Parents  | publisher = [[Jason Aronson|Aronson]]  | year = 1995  | location = NJ  | pages = 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual abuse==
Spiritual abuse includes:
* [[Psychological abuse]] and [[emotional abuse]]
* [[Physical abuse]] including physical injury and deprivation of sustenance.
* [[Sexual abuse]]
* Any act by deeds or words that [[shame]] or diminish the [[dignity]] of a person.

===Background===
The term ''spiritual abuse'' was purportedly coined in the late twentieth century to refer to alleged abuse of authority by church leaders,&lt;ref&gt;Jeff VanVonderen: "Spiritual abuse occurs when someone in a position of spiritual authority, the purpose of which is to 'come underneath' and serve, build, equip and make a deity's or a god's people MORE free, misuses that authority placing themselves over a god's people to control, coerce or manipulate them for seemingly godly purposes which are really their own."[http://www.spiritualabuse.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; albeit some scholars and historians would dispute that claim, citing prior literary appearances of the term in literature on religion and psychology. Lambert defines spiritual abuse as "a type of psychological predomination that could be rightly termed—''religious enslavement''."&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, ''Charismatic Captivation''; p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; He further identifies "religious enslavement" as being a product of what is termed in the [[Bible]] "[[witchcraft]]," or "[[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]."&lt;ref&gt;2 Chronicles 33:6; Galatians 5:20; Revelation 18:23; et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
[[Ronald Enroth]] in ''[[Churches That Abuse]]'' identifies five categories:{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

# '''Authority and Power''': abuse arises when leaders of a group arrogate to themselves power and authority that lacks the dynamics of open accountability and the capacity to question or challenge decisions made by leaders. The shift entails moving from general respect for an office bearer to one where members loyally submit without any right to dissent.
# '''[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]] and Control''': abusive groups are characterized by social dynamics where [[fear]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] or [[threats]] are routinely used to produce unquestioning obedience, group conformity or stringent tests of [[loyalty]]. The leader-disciple relationship may become one in which the leader's decisions control and usurp the disciple's right or capacity to make choices.
# '''[[Elitism]] and Persecution''': abusive groups depict themselves as unique and have a strong organizational tendency to be separate from other bodies and institutions. The social dynamism of the group involves being independent or separate, with diminishing possibilities for internal correction or reflection, whilst outside criticism.
# '''Life-style and Experience''': abusive groups foster rigidity in behavior and belief that requires conformity to the group's ideals.
# '''Dissent and Discipline''': abusive groups tend to suppress any kind of internal challenge to decisions made by leaders.

Agnes and John Lawless argue in ''The Drift into Deception'' that there are eight characteristics of spiritual abuse, and some of these clearly overlap with Enroth's criteria. They list the eight marks of spiritual abuse as comprising: {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
#[[Charisma]] and [[pride]]
#[[Anger]] and [[intimidation]]
#[[Seven deadly sins#Greed|Greed]] and [[fraud]]
#[[Immorality]]
#Enslaving [[authoritarian]] structure
#Exclusivity
#Demanding [[loyalty]] and honor
#New revelation

The author of ''Charismatic Captivation''&lt;ref&gt;Charismatic Captivation, by Steven Lambert&lt;/ref&gt; in a post on the book's website delineates "33 Signs of Spiritual Abuse",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charismatic-captivation.com/?p=5|title=The Signs of Spiritual Abuse|date=15 November 2008|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

#Apotheosis or de facto deification of the leadership.
#Absolute authority of the leadership.
#Pervasive abuse and misuse of authority in personal dealings with members to coerce submission.
#Paranoia, inordinate egotism or narcissism, and insecurity by the leaders.
#Abuse and inordinate incidence of "church discipline" particularly in matters not expressly considered to be church discipline issues.
#Inordinate attention to maintaining the public image of the ministry and lambasting of all "critics".
#Constant indoctrination with a "group" or "family" mentality that impels members to exalt the corporate "life" and goals of the church-group over their personal goals, callings, objectives or relationships.
#Members are psychologically traumatized, terrorized and indoctrinated with numerous fears aimed at creating an over-dependence or codependence on their leaders and the corporate group.
#Members may be required to obtain the approval (or ''witness'') of their leader(s) for decisions regarding personal matters.
#Frequent preaching from the pulpit discouraging leaving the religion or disobeying the leaderships' dictates.
#Members departing without the blessing of the leadership do so under a cloud of suspicion, shame, or slander.
#Departing members often suffer from psychological problems and display the symptoms associated with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).

===Research and examples===
Flavil Yeakley's team of researchers conducted field-tests with members of the [[Boston Church of Christ]] using the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]]. In ''The Discipling Dilemma'' Yeakley reports that the members tested "showed a high level of change in psychological type scores", with a "clear pattern of convergence in a single type".&lt;ref name="Yeakley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yeakley|first1=Flavil|title=The Discipling Dilemma|date=1988|publisher=Gospel Advocate Company|location=Nashville|isbn=0-89225-311-8|page=39|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same tests were conducted on five mainline [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s and with six groups that are popularly labeled as [[cult]]s or manipulative [[sect]]s. Yeakley's test results showed that the pattern in the Boston Church "was not found among other churches of Christ or among members of five mainline denominations, but that it was found in studies of six manipulative sects."&lt;ref name="Yeakley"/&gt; The research did ''not'' show that the Boston Church was "attracting people with a psychological need for high levels of control", but Yeakley concluded that "they are producing conformity in psychological type" which he deemed to be "unnatural, unhealthy and dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;Yeakley p44, p46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not a [[longitudinal study]] and relied on asking participants to answer the survey three times; once as they imagined they might answer five years prior, once as their present selves and once as they imagined they might answer after five years of influence in the sect. The author insists that despite this, "any significant changes in the pattern of these perceptions would indicate some kind of group pressure. A high degree of change and a convergence in a single type would be convincing proof that the Boston Church of Christ has some kind of group dynamic operating that tends to produce conformity to the group norm." However it could instead indicate a desire on the part of the respondents to change in the direction indicated. To determine actual changes in MBTI results would require a longitudinal study, since the methodology here was inherently suggestive of its conclusion. This is also amply borne out in its instructions: "The instructions stated clearly that no one was telling them that their answers ought to change. The instructions said that the purpose of the study was simply to find out if there were any changes and, if so, what those changes might indicate."&lt;ref&gt;Yeakley p.30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SS ''Politician''''' was an 8000-ton cargo ship owned by T &amp; J Harrison of Liverpool. It left [[Liverpool]] on 3 February 1941, bound for [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Jamaica]] and [[New Orleans]] with a cargo including 28,000 cases of [[malt whisky]].  The ship sank off the north coast of [[Eriskay]] in the Outer Hebrides, off the west coast of Scotland, and much of the wreck's cargo was [[Marine_salvage|salvaged]] by the island's inhabitants.  The story of the wreck and looting was the basis for the book and film ''[[Whisky Galore (disambiguation)|Whisky Galore!]]''.

== Origin ==

The ship was called ''Politician'' only after 1935, when she was purchased by T &amp; J Harrison from [[Furness Withy|Furness, Withy and Co.]], who had called her ''London Merchant''.
&lt;ref name="merchant"&gt;[http://www.merchantnavyofficers.com/harrisons.html T &amp; J Harrisons]. Quoting A.G. Collingwood. ''Sea Breezes''. May 1977 – via ''Merchant Navy Officers''.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same transaction, the vessels ''Royal Prince'', ''Imperial Prince'' and ''British Prince'' became ''Collegian'', ''Craftsman'' and ''Statesman'' respectively. All four [[steam turbine|turbine]]-engined [[sister ship]]s were built in 1922-3 to have a length of {{convert|450|ft|6|in}} and beam {{convert|58|ft}}, gross {{convert|8000|LT|t}} and achieve {{convert|14|kn}}. Built for the Furness London-New York route, Harrisons employed them to South Africa in peacetime.&lt;ref name="duster"&gt;[http://www.red-duster.co.uk/PRINCE13.htm Prince Line]. ''Red Duster''. The Merchant Navy Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrisons had previously owned another ''Politician'', built by [[Swan Hunter]] in 1899, which was bought by [[Christian Salvesen]] in 1922, renamed ''Coronda'' and used from 1940-5 as a store ship on the [[River Tyne|Tyne]].&lt;ref name="merchant"/&gt;

== History ==

On 5 February 1941, during [[gale force]] winds, she ran aground off the Island of [[Eriskay]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]] and later broke in two near the islet of [[Calvay]]. The crew were all unharmed and were looked after by the locals for a while.

When the locals learned from the crew of the ''Politician'' what the ship was carrying, a series of illegal, and later well-organised salvage operations took place at night, before the [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|customs and excise]] officials arrived. The island's supplies of whisky had dried up due to war-time rationing, so the islanders periodically helped themselves to some of the 28,000 cases (264,000 bottles) of Scotch whisky before winter weather broke up the ship. The men wore women's dresses on their "fishing trips", to keep their own clothes from being covered in incriminating oil from the ship's holds.  Boats came from as far away as [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] as news of the whisky spread across the Hebrides. No islander regarded it as stealing; for them the rules of salvage meant that once the bounty was in the sea, it was theirs to rescue.&lt;ref name="macphee"&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/ss-politician-whisky-galore-off-eriskay-1-465109 Scotsman Heritage article valid December 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not the view of the local customs officer. Charles McColl was incensed at what he saw as outright thievery going on. None of the whisky had paid a penny of duty, and he railed against this loss to the public purse. McColl whipped up a furore and made the police act. Villages were raided and [[Croft (land)|croft]]s turned upside down. Bottles were hidden, secreted, or simply drunk in order to hide the evidence.

== Trials ==

McColl and the police caught plenty of locals red-handed, and they were sent to trial. On 26 April at [[Lochmaddy]] Sheriff Court, a group of men from [[Barra]] pleaded guilty to theft and were charged between three and five pounds. McColl was beside himself at the leniency of the sentence, but the police (being largely locals themselves) were tired of harassing the locals who had not, in their minds, done such a bad thing.

But McColl continued on his crusade, and more men did appear in court, some of whom were sentenced to up to six weeks imprisonment in [[Inverness]] and [[Peterhead]].

At sea, salvage attempts did not go well, and it was eventually decided to let ''Politician'' remain where she was. McColl, who had already estimated that the islanders had purloined 24,000 bottles of whisky, ensured that there would be no more temptation. He applied for, and was granted, permission to explode her hull.

The islanders watched this extraordinary action, their emotions summed up by Angus John Campbell, who commented, "Dynamiting whisky. You wouldn't think there'd be men in the world so crazy as that!"&lt;ref name="macphee"/&gt;

== Banknotes ==
At the time, [[the Crown]] remained very unforthcoming about the incident, the cargo and the salvage. The majority of its hold was taken up by the whisky, but there was also an assortment of other cargo ranging from baths, plumbing fittings, pianos, art silks, motor parts, bedding, furniture, food and banknotes for Jamaica.

[[Public Record Office]] files released in January 2001&lt;ref name="telegraph 2001 26 January"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1319533/Banknotes-galore-after-whisky-ship-hit-the-rocks.html The Daily Telegraph 26 January 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; show that ''Politician'' was also carrying nearly 290,000 ten-shilling notes (145,000 pounds), which would be worth the equivalent of several million pounds at current exchange rates. (To give an idea of how much that was worth, a corporal on full pay in the [[British Army]] received 35 shillings a week). The British government hoped that they would not get into circulation, but they started turning up at banks all around the world. Some sources&lt;ref name="swinson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Antonia Swinson 'Return of scotch on the rocks' "&gt;[http://www.antoniaswinson.co.uk/resources.php?type=article&amp;pid=57 Antonia Swinson 'Return of scotch on the rocks'] &lt;/ref&gt; suggest that these supplies were being sent to the colonies in case there was need of evacuation in the war.

As soon as the weather allowed, Eriskay was besieged with customs officials, insurance agents and legitimate salvage companies. It is reported{{by whom|date=August 2013}} that the custom officials were not well received and one agent was refused accommodation by most of the townsfolk.

In April 1941 Captain E Lauriston, who was in charge of the operation, claimed that the banknotes had turned up in [[Benbecula]], {{convert|25|mi}} north of the wreck. The salvage company stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is reported that some of the children on the island have been playing with them and the locals, most of whom are known to be incriminated in the looting, are too wily to give anything away.&lt;ref name="telegraph 2001 26 January"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a memorandum, the Crown Agents noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The local police service is in no doubt on a very, very small scale but the nature of the place and its surroundings should tend to reduce the chances of serious loss through the notes being presented and paid.&lt;ref name="telegraph 2001 26 January"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Suspicions only began to rise when an empty cash case was found abandoned in the hold of the ship. By June, the banknotes from ''Politician'' were turning up in branches as far away as Liverpool. By mid July, a hundred or so had been tendered in Jamaica and almost two hundred in Britain.

By 1958 the Crown Agents reported that 211,267 notes had been recovered by the salvage company and the police and had been destroyed. A further 2,329 had been presented in banks in England, Scotland, Ireland, Switzerland, Malta, Canada, the US, and Jamaica. Only 1,509 were thought to have been presented in good faith. That still leaves 76,404 banknotes which have never been accounted for. Their fate remains a mystery.

The wreck of the ''Politician'' still lies off the coast of Eriskay, although it is below water line now as the winter gales destroyed the deck and cabins. In 1988 the island got its own legitimate pub, named The Politician ({{lang-gd|Am Politician}}).

== SS ''Politician'' in popular culture ==

The story of the shipwreck inspired the [[Compton Mackenzie]]'s 1947 novel ''[[Whisky Galore (novel)|Whisky Galore]]'' which was made into an [[Whisky Galore! (1949 film)|Ealing Comedy film]] in 1949.

A "Poem of the S.S ''Politician''" is attributed to Angus Mcintyre, Tobermory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.searoom.com/veleda/logsec05/politician.htm |title=Whiskey Galore: SS Politician |website=SeaRoom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003062832/http://www.searoom.com/veleda/logsec05/politician.htm |archivedate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Oi Polloi]] wrote a song about this ship on their album ''Ar Ceòl Ar Cànan Ar-A-Mach''.

Two books have been written detailing the history:

== Recent history ==

In 1987 Donald MacPhee, a local [[South Uist]] man, found eight bottles of whisky in the wreck; he sold them at Christies' auction for £4,000.&lt;ref name="macphee"&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/ss-politician-whisky-galore-off-eriskay-1-465109 Scotsman Heritage article valid December 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1989 a salvage company, SS Politician plc, was founded by Churchill Baron Financial Services of Glasgow, with Jeremy Brough as company chairman.
About £400,000 was invested by more than 500 people, but moving hundreds of tons of sand and steel plates only uncovered 24 more bottles, thereby creating a notional rate of return of £16,667/[[fifth (unit)|bottle]].  Some of the whisky was blended and bottled by SS Politician plc.

In 2013 two of the original eight bottles of whisky salvaged in 1987 by Donald MacPhee, sold for £12,050 after an online auction. Scotch Whisky Auctions, which sold the bottles, said they had gone to a buyer in the UK after worldwide interest.&lt;ref name="macphee3"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-22428609 Whisky Galore bottles fetch £12,050].

{{Refimprove|date=July 2014}}
'''Self-destructive behavior''' is any behavior that is harmful or potentially harmful towards the person who engages in the behavior. 

Self-destructive behaviors exist on a continuum, with [[suicide]] at one extreme end of the scale.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Aaron T.; Kovacs, Maria; Weissman, Arlene. Assessment of suicidal intention: The Scale for Suicide Ideation. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, Vol 47(2), Apr 1979, 343–352. https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.47.2.343&lt;/ref&gt; Self-destructive actions may be deliberate, born of impulse, or developed as a [[habit (psychology)|habit]]. The term however tends to be applied toward self-destruction that either is [[Death|fatal]], or is potentially habit-forming or [[Behavioral addiction|addictive]] and thus potentially fatal. Self-destructive behavior is often associated with mental illnesses such as [[borderline personality disorder]]&lt;ref&gt;Anthony W. Bateman, Roy Krawitz (2013). Borderline Personality Disorder: An evidence-based guide for generalist mental health professionals. OUP Oxford, {{ISBN|978-0199644209}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Nyman,
H. Jonsson. Patterns of self-destructive behaviour in schizophrenia. ''[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]]'', March 1986. DOI: 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1986.tb02682.x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O.IvarLovaas et al. Experimental studies in childhood schizophrenia: Analysis of self-destructive behavior. Journal of Experimental Child Psychology. 2(1) March 1965, Pages 67–84. https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0965(65)90016-0&lt;/ref&gt;

Acts of "self-destruction" may be merely metaphorical ("[[social suicide]]") or literal ([[suicide]]). &lt;!--It can take a variety of forms, and be undertaken for a variety of reasons. It is most visible in young adults and adolescents, but it may affect people of any age.--&gt; 

==Types of self-destructive behavior==
* [[Suicide]]
* [[Self-harm]]
* [[Eating disorder]]s{{mcn|date=March 2014}}
* [[Substance abuse]]

==Forms==
{{unreferenced section|small=y|date=August 2018}}
Self-destructive behavior may be used as a [[coping mechanism]] when one is overwhelmed. For example, faced with a pressing scholastic assessment, someone may choose to sabotage their work rather than cope with the stress. This would make submission of (or passing) the assessment impossible, but remove the worry associated with it.

Self-destructive behavior may also manifest itself in an active attempt to drive away other people. For example, they may fear that they will "mess up" a relationship. Rather than deal with this fear, socially self-destructive individuals engage in annoying or alienating behavior, so that others will reject them first.

More obvious forms of self-destruction are [[eating disorder]]s, [[alcohol abuse]], [[drug addiction]]s, [[sex addiction]], [[self-injury]], and [[suicide attempt]]s.

An important aspect of self-destructive behavior is the inability to handle the stress stemming from an individual's lack of [[self-confidence]] – for example in a relationship, whether the other person is truly faithful ("how can they love someone like me?"); at work or school, whether the realization of assignments and deadlines is possible ("there is no way I can complete all my work on time"). Self-destructive people usually lack healthier coping mechanisms, like asserting [[personal boundaries]]. As a result, they tend to feel that showing they are incompetent is the only way to untangle themselves from demands.

Successful individuals may self-destructively sabotage their own achievements; this may stem from a feeling of anxiety, unworthiness, or from an impulsive desire to repeat the "climb to the top."

Self-destructive behavior is often considered to be synonymous with self-harm, but this is not accurate. Self-harm is an extreme form of self-destructive behavior, but it may appear in many other guises.

'''''Shibui''''' (渋い) (adjective), '''''shibumi''''' (渋み) (noun), or '''''shibusa''''' (渋さ) (noun) are [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words which refer to a particular aesthetic of simple, subtle, and unobtrusive [[beauty]].&lt;ref name="HussainWilkinson2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr. Mazhar Hussain|author2=Robert Wilkinson|title=The Pursuit of Comparative Aesthetics: An Interface Between East and West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Wez4pgWp3AC&amp;pg=PA227|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5345-5|pages=227–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other [[Japanese aesthetics]] terms, such as ''[[Iki (aesthetic ideal)|iki]]'' and ''[[wabi-sabi]]'', ''shibui'' can apply to a wide variety of subjects, not just art or fashion.&lt;ref name="De_Garis2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=De Garis|title=We Japanese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUm0AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15|date=5 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-18367-6|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shibusa is an enriched, subdued appearance or experience of intrinsically fine quality with economy of form, line, and effort, producing a timeless tranquility.  Shibusa includes the following essential qualities: 
* Shibui objects appear to be simple overall but they include subtle details, such as textures, that balance simplicity with complexity.  
* This balance of simplicity and complexity ensures that one does not tire of a shibui object but constantly finds new meanings and enriched beauty that cause its aesthetic value to grow over the years.&lt;ref name="Lim2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sunamita Lim|title=Japanese Style: Designing with Nature's Beauty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsWemDyPlE4C&amp;pg=PA41|year=2007|publisher=Gibbs Smith|isbn=978-1-4236-0092-3|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shibusa walks a fine line between contrasting aesthetic concepts such as elegant and rough or spontaneous and restrained.&lt;ref name="Lebra1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Takie Sugiyama Lebra|title=Japanese Patterns of Behaviour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWG07rhiyUMC&amp;pg=PA20|year=1976|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-0460-2|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colors of shibusa are "muddy" colors.&lt;ref name="De_Garis2013"/&gt; For example, in interior decorating and painting, gray is added to primary colors to create a silvery effect that ties the different colors together into a coordinated scheme.  Depending upon how much gray is added, shibui colors range from pastels to dark. Occasionally, a patch of brighter color is added as a highlight.

[[File:Shibusa modesty wiki.jpg|thumb|right|"Shibusa Modesty" iron glaze vase, Dorothy Bearnson, 1988.]]
Shibusa is not to be confused with wabi or sabi.  Though many wabi or sabi objects are shibui, not all shibui objects are wabi or sabi. Wabi or sabi objects can be more severe and sometimes exaggerate intentional imperfections to such an extent that they can appear to be artificial. Shibui objects are not necessarily imperfect or asymmetrical, though they can include these qualities. 

The seven elements of shibusa are simplicity, implicity, modesty, naturalness, everydayness, imperfection, and silence.  They are adapted from the concepts authored by Dr. Soetsu Yanagi (1898–1961), aesthetician and museum curator, published in the Japanese magazine ''Kogei'' between 1930–1940. The aristocratic simplicity of shibusa is the refined expression of the essence of elements in an aesthetic experience producing quietude. Spare elegance is evident in darkling serenity with a hint of sparkle.  Implicity allows depth of feeling to be visible through spare surface design thereby manifesting the invisible core that offers new meanings with each encounter.  The person of shibui modesty exalts excellence via taking time to learn, watch, read, understand, develop, think, and merges into understatement and silence concerning oneself.  Naturalness conveys spontaneity in unforced growth.  Shibusa freedom is maintained in healthy roughness of texture and irregular asymmetrical form wherein the center lies beyond all particular things, in infinity. Everydayness raises ordinary things to a place of honor, void of all artificial and unnecessary properties, thus imparting spiritual joy—for today is more auspicious than tomorrow.  Everydayness provides a framework, a tradition for an artist's oeuvre to be a unit not a process.  Hiroshi Mizuo argues that the best examples of shibusa are found in the crafts, ordinary objects made for everyday use. They tend to be more spontaneous and healthy than many of the fine arts.  Imperfection is illustrated in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s gothic novel, ''The Marble Faun''.  The chapter "An Aesthetic Company" mentions some ragged and ill-conditioned antique drawings and their attributions and virtues.

Imperfection in shibusa Sōetsu Yanagi in ''[[The Unknown Craftsman]]'' refers to as "beauty with inner implications".  Creation here means making a piece that will lead the viewer to draw beauty from it for oneself.  Shibui beauty in Tea Ceremony is in the artistry of the viewer.

Shibusa's sanctuary of silence is non-dualism—the resolution of opposites. Its foundation is intuition coupled with faith and beauty revealing phases of truth and the worship and reverence for life.

In [[James A. Michener]]'s book ''[[Iberia (book)|Iberia]]'' the adjective 'shibui' is referenced as follows: "The Japanese have a word which summarizes all the best in Japanese life, yet it has no explanation and cannot be translated. It is the word ''shibui'', and the best approximation to its meaning is 'acerbic good taste.'" The author Trevanian (the nom de plume of Dr. Rodney William Whitaker) wrote in his 1979 best-selling
novel ''[[Shibumi (novel)|Shibumi]]'', "Shibumi has to do with great refinement underlying commonplace appearances." In the [[business fable]] ''[[The Shibumi Strategy]]'', the author, [[Matthew E. May]], wrote that shibumi "has come to denote those things that exhibit in paradox and all at once the very best of everything and nothing: Elegant simplicity. Effortless effectiveness. Understated excellence. Beautiful imperfection."
  
Shibui, a registration or 'felt sense' of evolving perfection.  What is being registered is the 'Life' behind the qualities of any experience.  A 'felt sense' of qualities, such as, quiet beauty with intelligence, love, light, and joy.  These qualities can be more easily registered when quietly viewing simple, natural everyday phenomenon or objects, such as a sunrise or a simple piece of pottery.  Shibui can sometimes be more easily registered by two people in a meditative state (quiet in their emotions and their minds) while viewing the same phenomenon or object. For example, when viewing the same sunset or piece of art, subconsciously, both people register the qualities of the 'Life' or implicity underlying the experience or object; this registration of the underlying 'Life' precipitates into the conscious as registering something 'extraordinary' in the everyday 'ordinary'.  If you both register, then looking into the other person's eyes, you understand that you both shared the same phenomenon, a 'knowing' of the underlying 'Life', or at least the qualities of that underlying 'Life'.  The qualities registered can seem paradoxical. Complex experiences or objects seem simple; perfection is found in imperfection.  All objects and experiences, both everyday and extraordinary, can have a beauty, a quiet purposeful intent, a cool 'matter of fact' underlying joy.

Potters, musicians, painters, bonsai and other artists often work to bring in 'Shibui-like' qualities into their art.  A few go behind these qualities to bring the underlying 'Life' into their art.  Expert singers, actors, potters, and artists of all other sorts were often said to be ''shibui''; their expertise caused them to do things beautifully without making them excessive or gaudy. Today, sometimes baseball players are even said to be ''shibui'' when they contribute to the overall success of the team without doing anything to make themselves stand out individually. The apparent effortlessness displayed by athletes such as tennis player Roger Federer and hockey great Wayne Gretzky are examples of shibumi in personal performance. Shibui, and its underlying 'Life', is found in all art and in everything around us—including ourselves.  Taking the path to understand and experience Shibui, is a step towards understanding and consciously registering the 'Life' underlying all.

==History of the term==
[[File:Diospyros kaki Frucht.jpg|thumb|right|An almost ripe ''Shibui'', the fruit of ''[[Diospyros kaki]]'']]
Originating in the [[Muromachi period]] (1336–1573) as ''shibushi'', the term originally referred to a sour or astringent taste, such as that of an unripe [[persimmon]].&lt;ref name="HussainWilkinson2006"/&gt; ''Shibui'' maintains that literal meaning still, and remains the antonym of amai (甘い), meaning 'sweet'.

However, by the beginnings of the [[Edo period]] (1615–1868), the term had gradually begun to refer to a pleasing aesthetic. The people of Edo expressed their tastes in using this term to refer to anything from song to fashion to craftsmanship that was beautiful by being understated, or by being precisely what it was meant to be and not elaborated upon. Essentially, the aesthetic ideal of ''shibumi'' seeks out events, performances, people or objects that are beautiful in a direct and simple way, without being flashy.

Soetsu Yanagi work as translated by Bernard Leach in ''[[The Unknown Craftsman]]'' discusses shibumi.

The concept of ''shibusa'' was introduced to the West in August and September, 1960, in publications of the American magazine ''[[House Beautiful]]''.

'''Slaven Tolj''' (born in 1964), a [[multimedia artist]] from [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]]. He achieved international recognition for his [[installation art|installations]], [[body art]], and [[performances]] presenting distinct [[political]] and social-cultural [[criticism]]. 

The beginning of Slaven Tolj’s work, as an artist, was determined by his experiences of the [[Yugoslav War]], the [[Siege of Dubrovnik]] by the Yugoslavian army in the years 1991-1992, as well as the disintegration of [[former Yugoslavia]].
In the course of the late 1990s Slaven Tolj gradually extended the scope of his art, incorporating themes and issues related to political transformation and the emergence of [[multiculturalism]] and [[globalization]].

Slaven Tolj has also been involved in organisational and curatorial activities. He is one of the founders of [[Art Workshop Lazareti]] in Dubrovnik – a key institution for contemporary art scene in Dubrovnik and Croatia.   

In 2005 he was the commissioner of the Croatian pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artnews.org/news.php?i=3595&amp;t=news artnews.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stimulation''' is the encouragement of development or the cause of activity generally. For example, "The press provides stimulation of political discourse." An interesting or fun activity can be described as "stimulating", regardless of its physical effects on senses. ''Stimulate'' means to act as a stimulus to; ''stimulus'' means something that rouses the recipient to activity; &lt;nowiki/&gt;''stimuli'' is the plural of ''stimulus''.

A particular use of the term is '''physiological stimulation''', which refers to '''sensory excitation''', the action of various agents or forms of energy ([[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]) on receptors that generate [[Action potential|impulses]] that travel through [[nerves]] to the brain (afferents). There are [[sensory receptors]] on or near the surface of the body, such as photoreceptors in the retina of the eye, [[hair cell]]s in the cochlea of the ear, touch receptors in the skin and chemical receptors in the mouth and nasal cavity. There are also sensory receptors in the [[muscles]], joints, digestive tract, and membranes around organs such as the brain, the abdominal cavity, the bladder and the prostate (providing one source of [[sexual stimulation]]). Stimulation to the external or internal senses may evoke involuntary activity or guide intentions in action.  Such emotional or motivating stimulation typically is also experienced subjectively (enters awareness, is in consciousness). Perception can be regarded as conceptualised stimulation, used in reasoning and intending, for example. When bodily stimulation is perceived it is traditionally called a sensation, such as a kind of touch or a taste or smell, or a painful or pleasurable sensation. This can be thought of as [[Stimulus (psychology)|psychological stimulation]], which is a stimulus affecting a person's thinking or feeling processes.

==Overview==
Stimulation, in general, refers to how organisms perceive incoming stimuli. As such it is part of the [[stimulus-response model|stimulus-response]] mechanism. Simple organisms broadly react in three ways to stimulation: too little stimulation causes them to stagnate, too much to die from [[stress (medicine)|stress]] or inability to adapt, and a medium amount causes them to adapt and grow as they overcome it. Similar categories or effects are noted with psychological stress with people. Thus, stimulation may be described as how external events provoke a response by an individual in the attempt to [[coping mechanism|cope]].

==Over-stimulation==
It is possible to become [[habituation|habituated]] to a particular degree of stimulation, and then find it uncomfortable to have a significant change from that level of the stimulus. Thus one can become used to intense stimuli or a fast-paced life and suffer [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] when they are removed. Stress and unhappiness may result an unaccustomed level of stimulation.

Ongoing, long-term stimulation can for some individuals prove harmful, and a more relaxed and less stimulated life may be beneficial despite possible initial discomfort or stress from the change. See also; [[sensory overload]] and [[burnout (psychology)|burnout]].

Individuals with neurological conditions like [[autism]] or [[intellectual disability]] may be prone to overstimulation and suffer sensory overload at levels of stimulus that others find unexceptional.

It is hypothesized{{Who?|date=September 2015}} that long-term overstimulation can result eventually in a phenomenon called "[[Adrenal fatigue|adrenal exhaustion]]" over time, but this is neither medically accepted nor proven at this time{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5685">'''Synectics''' is a [[problem solving]] methodology that stimulates thought processes of which the subject may be unaware. This method was developed by [[George M. Prince]] (April 5, 1918 – June 9, 2009)&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2009/06/21/george_prince_consultant_who_sparked_creative_ideas/ George Prince, consultant who sparked innovation, founded international firm], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', June 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William J.J. Gordon]], originating in the [[Arthur D. Little]] Invention Design Unit in the 1950s.

==History==
The process was derived from [[Tape recorder|tape-recording]] (initially [[Sound|audio]], later [[video]]) meetings, analysis of the results and experiments with alternative ways of dealing with the obstacles to success in the meeting. "Success" was defined as getting a creative solution that the group was committed to implement.

The name Synectics comes from the Greek and means "the joining together of different and apparently irrelevant elements."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, William J.J. ''Synectics: The Development of Creative Capacity''. (New York: Harper and row, Publishers, 1961), 3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon and Prince named both their practice and their new company Synectics, which can cause confusion as people not part of the company are trained and use the practice. While the name was trademarked, it has become a standard word for describing creative problem solving in groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/kwessel/MBA%20660%20Session%202%20Folder/9993081.pdf Nolan, Vincent. "Whatever Happened to Synectics?" ''Creativity and Innovation Management,'' v. 21 n.1 (2003): 25.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Synectics is a way to approach [[creativity]] and [[Problem solving|problem-solving]] in a rational way. "Traditionally, the creative process has been considered after the fact... The Synectics study has attempted to research creative process in vivo, while it is going on."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gordon, Synectics research has three main assumptions:
*The [[Creativity|creative process]] can be described and taught;
*Invention processes in arts and sciences are analogous and are driven by the same "psychic" processes;
*Individual and group creativity are analogous.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
With these assumptions in mind, Synectics believes that people can be better at being creative if they understand how creativity works.

One important element in creativity is embracing the seemingly [[Relevance|irrelevant]]. Emotion is emphasized over intellect and the [[Irrationality|irrational]] over the [[Rationality|rational]]. Through understanding the emotional and irrational elements of a problem or idea, a group can be more successful at solving a problem.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince emphasized the importance of creative [[Behavior|behaviour]] in reducing inhibitions and releasing the inherent creativity of everyone. He and his colleagues developed specific practices and meeting structures which help people to ensure that their constructive intentions are experienced positively by one another. The use of the creative behaviour tools extends the application of Synectics to many situations beyond invention sessions (particularly constructive resolution of conflict).

Gordon emphasized the importance of {{"'}}metaphorical process' to make the familiar strange and the strange familiar". He expressed his central principle as: "Trust things that are alien, and alienate things that are trusted." This encourages, on the one hand, fundamental problem-analysis and, on the other hand, the [[Social alienation|alienation]] of the original [[problem]] through the creation of [[analogy|analogies]]. It is thus possible for new and surprising solutions to emerge.

As an invention tool, Synectics invented a technique called "springboarding" for getting creative beginning ideas. For the development of beginning ideas, the method incorporates brainstorming and deepens and widens it with [[metaphor]]; it also adds an important evaluation process for Idea Development, which takes embryonic new ideas that are attractive but not yet feasible and builds them into new courses of action which have the commitment of the people who will implement them.

Synectics is more demanding of the subject than [[brainstorming]], as the steps involved imply that the process is more complicated and requires more time and effort. The success of the Synectics [[methodology]] depends highly on the skill of a trained [[facilitator]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Dick, ''High Tech Creativity'', [[IEEE]] Engineers' Guide to Business, pp. 117-8, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tape diagram''', also known as a '''bar model''', is a pictorial representation of [[ratio]]s. In [[mathematics education]], it is used to solve [[word problem (mathematics education)|word problems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Lisa Watts-Lawton and Colleen Sheeron |title=Eureka Math Curriculum Guide: A Story of Units, Grade 2 yes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r5IvCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128 |year=2015 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-81261-7 |page=128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So lets do this problem that has been given to us by teachers all around. ''A boy has won 15 games, for every 3 games that he wins, he loses 2, how many games has the little boy lost?''

==Example==

A math problem reads: A boy has won 15 games. His ratio for him is 3:2. The tape diagram would look something like this:

{| class="ckckck m 
| 
| style="background: #ccccff;" | ?
| style="background: #ccccff;" | ?
| style="background: #ffffff;" | &amp;nbsp;
|-
! colspan="4" | Total games lost = ?
|}
Using the above diagram, it can be concluded that the boy has lost 10 playing times.{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}

==How does the tape diagram work==
The tape diagram works by showing different ratios. In the example before it shows how a boy has won 15 games. So if his win to loss ratio is 3:2 it would look like this. How many games has he lost?(3x5)

Now how did you get those three 5s you ask.
{|
! colsepan="4" | Total games won = 15
|-
! Win
| style="background: #ccccff;" | 5
| style="background: #ccccff;" | 5
| style="background: #ccccff;" | 5
| 
| style="background: #ccccff;" | 5
| style="background: #ccccff;" |5
| style="background: #ffffff;" | fh&amp;nbsp;
|-
! colsepan="4" | Total games lost = ?
|}

So the answer to how many games did he lose is 10. Because 5+5=10

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7456">The '''Texas sharpshooter fallacy''' is an [[informal fallacy]] which is committed when differences in data are ignored, but similarities are stressed. From this reasoning, a false conclusion is inferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |entry=Texas sharpshooter fallacy |last=Bennett |first=Bo |title=Logically Fallacious |accessdate=21 October 2014 |ref=harv |url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/176-texas-sharpshooter-fallacy| quote = description: ignoring the difference while focusing on the similarities, thus coming to an inaccurate conclusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fallacy is the philosophical or rhetorical application of the [[multiple comparisons]] problem (in statistics) and [[apophenia]] (in cognitive psychology). It is related to the [[clustering illusion]], which is the tendency in human [[cognition]] to interpret patterns where none actually exist.

The name comes from a joke about a [[Texas|Texan]] who fires some gunshots at the side of a barn, then paints a target centered on the tightest cluster of hits and claims to be a [[sharpshooter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/texas/entry/texas_sharpshooter_fallacy/|title=Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy|author=Barry Popik|publisher=barrypopik.com|date=2013-03-09|accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crab.rutgers.edu/~mbravo/cluster.pdf|title=The cancer-cluster myth|author=Atul Gawande|publisher=The New Yorker|date=1999-08-02|accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Carroll | first1 = Robert Todd | authorlink1 = Robert Todd Carroll | title = The Skeptic's Dictionary: a collection of strange beliefs, amusing deceptions, and dangerous delusions | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | year = 2003 | page = 375 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&amp;lpg=PA375&amp;vq=texas%20sharpshooter&amp;dq=%22texas%20sharpshooter%20fallacy%22%20logical%20fallacies&amp;pg=PA375#v=snippet&amp;q=texas%20sharpshooter&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2012-03-25 | isbn = 0-471-27242-6 | quote = The term refers to the story of the Texan who shoots holes in the side of a barn and then draws a bull's-eye around the bullet holes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
[[File:Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy illustration.png|thumb|A set of 100 randomly generated coordinates displayed on a scatter graph. Examining the points it is easy to identify apparent patterns. In particular, random data points do not spread out but cluster, giving the impression of "hot spots" created by some underlying cause.]]
The Texas sharpshooter fallacy often arises when a person has a large amount of data at his or her disposal, but only focuses on a small subset of that data. Some factor other than the one attributed may give all the elements in that subset some kind of common property (or pair of common properties, when arguing for correlation). If the person attempts to account for the likelihood of finding ''some'' subset in the large data with ''some'' common property by a factor other than its actual cause, then that person is likely committing a Texas sharpshooter fallacy.

The fallacy is characterized by a lack of a specific hypothesis prior to the gathering of data, or the formulation of a hypothesis only after data have already been gathered and examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Painting the target around the matching profile: the Texas sharpshooter fallacy in forensic DNA interpretation | journal = Law, Probability, &amp; Risk | date = July 18, 2009 | first = William C. | last = Thompson | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 257–258| url = http://lpr.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/3/257.full.pdf+html | accessdate = 2012-03-25 | quote = Texas sharpshooter fallacy...this article demonstrates how post hoc target shifting occurs and how it can distort the frequency and likelihood ratio statistics used to characterize DNA matches, making matches appear more probative than they actually are. | doi=10.1093/lpr/mgp013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it typically does not apply if one had an ''[[ex ante]]'', or prior, expectation of the particular relationship in question before examining the data. For example one might, prior to examining the information, have in mind a specific physical mechanism implying the particular relationship. One could then use the information to give support or cast doubt on the presence of that mechanism. Alternatively, if additional information can be generated using the same process as the original information, one can use the original information to construct a hypothesis, and then test the hypothesis on the new data. (See [[hypothesis testing]].) What one ''cannot'' do is use ''the same'' information to construct ''and'' test the same hypothesis (see [[hypotheses suggested by the data]])—to do so would be to commit the Texas sharpshooter fallacy.

== Examples ==
* A Swedish study in 1992 tried to determine whether [[Electromagnetic radiation and health|power lines caused some kind of poor health effects]]. The researchers surveyed everyone living within 300 meters of high-voltage power lines over a 25-year period and looked for statistically significant increases in rates of over 800 ailments. The study found that the incidence of childhood leukemia was four times higher among those who lived closest to the power lines, and it spurred calls to action by the Swedish government.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13618450-300-swedish-studies-pinpoint-power-line-cancer-link/&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with the conclusion, however, was that the number of potential ailments, i.e. over 800, was so large that it created a high probability that at least one ailment would exhibit the appearance of a statistically significant difference by chance alone; i.e. the [[multiple comparisons problem]]. Subsequent studies failed to show any association between power lines and childhood leukemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/programs/transcripts/1319.html |title=Frontline: previous reports: transcripts: currents of fear |publisher=PBS |date=1995-06-13 |accessdate=2012-07-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203040412/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/programs/transcripts/1319.html|archivedate=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation and interpretation===
* This fallacy is often found in modern-day interpretations of the [[quatrain]]s of [[Nostradamus]]. Nostradamus's quatrains are often liberally translated from the original (archaic) French, stripped of their historical context, and then applied to support the conclusion that Nostradamus predicted a given modern-day event, after the event actually occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/rumors/nostradamus.asp |title=Nostradamus Predicted 9/11? |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars''''', also translated as '''''The Twenty-four Paragons of Filial Piety''''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|二|十|四|孝}}|p=Èrshísì Xiào}}), is a classic text of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] [[filial piety]] written by [[Guo Jujing]] (郭居敬)&lt;ref name="Guo Jujing"&gt;(郭居敬尤溪人。性至孝，事親，左右承順，得其歡心。嘗摭虞舜而下二十四人孝行之概序而詩之，名二十四孝詩，以訓童蒙。) Wang, Qi (王圻). ''Xu Wenxian Tongkao'' (續文獻通考) vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1260–1368). The text was extremely influential in the medieval Far East and was used to teach Confucian moral values.

==Authorship==
The text is generally attributed to [[Guo Jujing]] (郭居敬)&lt;ref name="Guo Jujing" /&gt; but other sources suggested two other possible authors or editors: [[Guo Shouzheng]] (郭守正)&lt;ref&gt;(坊間所刻《二十四孝》，不知所始。後讀《永樂大典》，乃是郭守敬之弟守正集。) Han, Taihua (韓泰華). ''Wushi Weifu Zhai Suibi'' (無事為福齋隨筆) vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Guo Juye]] (郭居業).&lt;ref&gt;(至元朝郭居業始將伊古以來孝行卓著者集24人，名二十四孝，以昭後世。) Pan, Shoulian (潘守廉). ''Ershisi Xiaotu Shuo Bing Shi'' (二十四孝圖說並詩) preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Some of the stories in ''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars'' were taken from other texts such as the ''Xiaozi Zhuan'' (孝子傳), ''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'', ''[[Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era]]'' and ''[[In Search of the Supernatural]]''.

There were earlier precedents of ''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars''. A Buddhist ''[[Bianwen (transformation texts)|bianwen]]'' titled ''Ershisi Xiao Yazuowen'' (二十四孝押座文), which was among the [[Dunhuang manuscripts|manuscripts]] discovered in [[Dunhuang]]'s [[Mogao Caves]], is the oldest extant text related to ''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars''. During the [[Southern Song dynasty]], the artist Zhao Zigu (趙子固) drew a painting, ''Ershisi Xiao Shuhua Hebi'' (二十四孝書畫合璧), about ''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars''. During the [[Yuan dynasty]], the scholar [[Xie Yingfang]] (謝應芳) mentioned in ''Gui Chao Ji'' (龜巢集) that a certain Wang Dashan (王達善) once praised ''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars'' and the ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]''. During the [[Qing dynasty]], Wu Zhengxiu (吳正修) mentioned in ''Ershisi Xiao Gu Ci'' (二十四孝鼓詞) that the Twenty-four Filial Exemplars were very well known.

After the release of ''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars'', revised editions of the text and other similar works were published. Some of these include: ''Riji Gushi Daquan Ershisi Xiao'' (日記故事大全二十四孝; ''Complete Diary Stories of the Twenty-four Filial Exemplars''), ''Nü Ershisi Xiao'' (女二十四孝; ''Female Twenty-four Filial Exemplars''), and ''Nan Nü Ershisi Xiao'' (男女二十四孝; ''Male and Female Twenty-four Filial Exemplars'').

The philologist [[Yang Bojun]] mentioned the development of ''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars'' in ''Jingshu Qiantan'' (經書淺談). After the book was compiled by Guo Shouzheng during the Yuan dynasty, a new illustrated edition with drawings by Wang Kexiao (王克孝) was released, and this made the book even more popular. Towards the end of the Qing dynasty, [[Zhang Zhidong]] and others edited and expanded the book and released it as ''Bai Xiao Tu Shuo'' (百孝圖說; ''Illustrated Hundred Stories of Filial Piety'').&lt;ref&gt;(元代郭守正將24位古人孝道的事輯錄成書，由王克孝繪成《二十四孝圖》流傳世間；清末，張之洞等人將之擴編至《百孝圖說》。應園先生邀請為其86歲父親慶壽，陳少梅完全依照元代王克孝《二十四孝圖》內容繪製了《二十四孝圖》卷，與之相比，徐操創作的《二十四孝史》則更具個性化。) Yang, Bojun. ''Jingshu Qiantan'' (經書淺談).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation==
The concept of filial piety has played a strong role in Chinese culture since ancient times. There was also a tradition of [[Filial mourning (China)|filial mourning]], in which a person had to temporarily put aside whatever he/she was doing when his/her parent(s) died and mourn for three years. There were sayings such as "When a ruler wants a subject to die, the subject must die; when a father wants a son to die, the son must die", and "A loyal subject should be sought from a family with filial sons."&lt;ref&gt;(夫國以簡賢為務，賢以孝行為首。孔子曰：‘事親孝故忠可移於君，是以求忠臣必於孝子之門。’) Fan, Ye. ''Book of the Later Han'' vol. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in contemporary times, some stories in ''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars'' are regarded as negative examples. These stories include the extreme example of Guo Ju deciding to kill his son so that he could free up his son's share of the family's food consumption to feed his mother. The negative examples also include stories in which the protagonist harms himself in the process of fulfilling filial piety, such as Wu Meng allowing mosquitoes to suck his blood in the hope that they would not bother his parents, and [[Wang Xiang]] lying naked on ice to thaw the ice so that he could catch fish for his mother.

There are some stories which are heavily criticised and even deemed contrary to Confucian principles. One example is the story of Cai Shun being rewarded by the [[Chimei]] rebels for his filial piety. The story paints the rebels in a positive light when they actually violated the [[Confucianism#Loyalty|Confucian virtue of loyalty to one's country]]. Another example is the story of Laolaizi behaving in a childish manner to amuse his parents. The modern writer [[Lu Xun]] said that Laolaizi's story is "an insult to the ancients, and a bad influence on future generations".&lt;ref&gt;(正如將‘肉麻當作有趣’一般，以不情為倫紀，污衊了古人，教壞了後人。老萊子即是一例，道學先生以為他白璧無瑕時，他卻已在孩子的心中死掉了。) Lu, Xun.

When Jiang's mother said she preferred more company, the couple invited their neighbours to join them during meals. One day, due to bad weather, Jiang's wife did not return in time from her trip to the river.

'''View''' or '''position''' ([[Pali]] ''{{IAST|diṭṭhi}}'', [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|dṛṣṭi}}'') is a central idea in [[Buddhism]].{{sfn|Fuller|2005|page=1}} In Buddhist thought, a view is not a simple, abstract collection of propositions, but a charged interpretation of experience which intensely shapes and affects thought, sensation, and action.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus 2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=Dan|last=Lusthaus|title=Buddhist Phenomenology|url=http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/buddhist_phenomenology_-_a_pholosophical_investigation_of_yogacara_buddhism_and_the_cheng_wei-shih_lun.pdf|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|page=242, n. 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having the proper mental attitude toward views is therefore considered an integral part of the Buddhist path, as sometimes correct views need to put into practice and incorrect views abandoned, and sometimes all views are seen as obstacles to enlightenment.{{sfn|Fuller|2005|pages=1–2}}

== Positions ==
[[File:Jungle Landscape.jpg|alt=jungle in India|thumb|255x255px|In describing the highly diverse intellectual landscape of his day, the Buddha is said to have referred to "the wrangling of views, the jungle of views".&lt;ref name="Harvey 2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter |last=Harvey|title=Buddhist Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NoLAHXt4PRMC|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2000|pages=239–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Views are produced by and in turn produce [[sankhara|mental conditioning]]. They are symptoms of conditioning, rather than neutral alternatives individuals can dispassionately choose.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus 2002" /&gt; The Buddha, according to [[Pali Canon|early texts]], having attained the state of [[Nibbana|unconditioned mind]], is said to have "passed beyond the bondage, tie, greed, obsession, acceptance, attachment, and lust of view."{{sfn|Fuller|2005|page=2}}

Those who wish to experience [[nirvana]] must free themselves from everything binding them to the world, including philosophical and religious doctrines.&lt;ref name="Skirbekk 2001"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Gunnar|last1=Skirbekk|first2=Nils|last2=Gilje|title=A history of Western thought: from ancient Greece to the twentieth century|url=https://books.google.co.th/books?id=NoLAHXt4PRMC|edition=7th|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2001|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right view|Right view]] as the first part of the Noble Eightfold Path leads ultimately not to the holding of correct views, but to a detached form of cognition.{{sfn|Fuller|2005|page=2}}

== Understanding karma ==
{{See also|Noble Eightfold Path}}
The term "right view" (''{{IAST|samyak-dṛuṣṭi}}'' / ''{{IAST|sammā-diṭṭhi}}'') or "right understanding" is basically about having a correct attitude towards one's social and religious duties. This is explained from the perspective of the system of [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]] and the [[samsara|cycle of rebirth]].{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=88}} Used in an ethical context, it entails that our actions have consequences, that death is not the end, that our actions and beliefs also have consequences after death, and that the Buddha followed and taught a successful path out of this world and [[Buddhist cosmology|the other world]] (heaven and underworld or hell).{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=12; 77-79}}{{sfn|Velez de Cea|2013|p=54}}{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=88}} Originating in the pre-Buddhist [[Brahmanical]] concerns with [[yajna|sacrifice rituals]] and [[Asceticism#Hinduism|asceticism]], in early texts the Buddha shifts the emphasis to a karmic perspective, which includes the entire religious life. The Buddha further describes such right view as beneficial, because whether these views are true or not, people acting on them (e.i. leading a good life) will be praised by the wise.{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=88}} They will also act in a correct way. If the views do turn out to be true, and there is a next world after death, such people will experience the good karma of what they have done when they were still alive. This is not to say that the Buddha is described as uncertain about right view: he, as well as other accomplished spiritual masters, are depicted as having "seen" these views by themselves as reality.&lt;!--p=88--&gt; Although devotees may not be able to see these truths for themselves yet, they are expected to develop a "pro-attitude" towards them.&lt;!--p=89--&gt;{{sfn|Collins|1990|pp=88–9}} Moral right view is not just considered to be adopted, however. Rather, the practitioner endeavors to live following right view, such practice will reflect on the practitioner, and will eventually lead to deeper insight into and wisdom about reality.{{sfn|Fuller|2005|p=41}}

According to Indologist Tilmann Vetter, right view came to explicitly include karma and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|Rebirth]], and the importance of the [[Four Noble Truths]], when "insight" became central to Buddhist [[soteriology]].{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=77}} This presentation of right view still plays an essential role in Theravada Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Harvey 2000" /&gt;

== Understanding doctrine ==
A second meaning of right view is an initial understanding of points of doctrine such as the [[Four Noble Truths]], [[anatman|not-self]] and [[Dependent Origination]],&lt;!--pp=89-90--&gt; combined with the intention to accept those teachings and apply them to oneself.&lt;!--pp=92, 95--&gt; Thirdly, a "supramundane" right view is also distinguished, which refers to a more refined, intuitive understanding produced by meditative practice. Thus, a gradual path of self-development is described, in which the meaning of right view gradually develops.&lt;!--pp=91-2--&gt; In the beginning, right view can only lead to a good rebirth, but at the highest level, right view can help the practitioner to attain to liberation from the cycle of existence.&lt;!--p=120--&gt;{{sfn|Collins|1990|pp=89–92, 95, 120}}

Buddhist Studies scholar Paul Fuller believes that although there are differences between the different levels of right view, all levels aim for emotional detachment. The wisdom of right view at the moral level leads to see the world without [[lobha|greed]], [[Dvesha|hatred]] and [[moha (Buddhism)|delusion]].{{sfn|Fuller|2005|p=42}}

Misunderstanding objects as self is not only seen as a form of wrong view, but also as a manifestation of desire, requiring a change in character.{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=119}}

== No views ==
The Buddha of the [[early Buddhism|early discourses]] often refers to the negative effect of attachment to speculative or fixed views, dogmatic opinions, or even correct views if not known to be true by personal verification. In describing the highly diverse intellectual landscape of his day, he is said to have referred to "the wrangling of views, the jungle of views".&lt;ref name="Harvey 2000" /&gt; He assumed an unsympathetic attitude toward speculative and religious thought in general.&lt;ref name="Skirbekk 2001"/&gt; In a set of poems in the early text [[Sutta Nipata]], the Buddha states that he himself has no viewpoint. According to Steven Collins, these poems distill the style of teaching that was concerned less with the content of views and theories than with the psychological states of those who hold them.{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=129}}{{elucidate|date=December 2017}}

==In practice==

In one study,&lt;ref&gt;Dhebar, B. B., &amp; Stokes, B. (2008). A nonprofit manager's guide to online volunteering. Nonprofit Management and Leadership, 18 (4), 497–506.&lt;/ref&gt; over 70 per cent of online volunteers chose assignments requiring one to five hours a week and nearly half chose assignments lasting 12 weeks or less.  Some organizations offer online volunteering opportunities which last from ten minutes to an hour. A unique feature of online volunteering is that it can be done from a distance. People with restricted mobility or other special needs participate in ways that might not be possible in traditional face-to-face volunteering. Likewise, online volunteering may allow people to overcome social inhibitions and [[social anxiety]], particularly if they would normally experience disability-related labeling or stereotyping. This empowers people who might not otherwise volunteer. It can build [[self-confidence]] and [[self-esteem]] while enhancing skills and extending networks and social ties.  Online volunteering also allows participants to adapt their program of volunteer work to their unique skills and passions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;State of the World's Volunteerism Report 2011: Universal Values for Global Well-being, United Nations Volunteers, {{ISBN|978-9211012460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People engaged in virtual volunteering undertake a variety of activities from locations remote to the organization or people they are assisting, via a computer or other Internet-connected device, such as:

* researching subjects (e.g. for [[Wikia]] projects)
* writing software (see [[open-source software]] which is often made by volunteers)
* fixing software (e.g. [[Community patch]]es)
* creating [[web page]]s
* editing or writing proposals, press releases, newsletter articles, etc.
* translating documents (e.g. [[Fan translation]]s)
* developing material for a curriculum
* designing a [[database]]
* designing [[graphics]]
* scanning documents
* providing legal, business, medical, agricultural or any other expertise
* counseling people
* [[Online tutoring|tutoring]] or [[E-mentoring|mentoring]] students
* moderating [[online discussion]] groups
* writing songs
* creating a [[podcast]]
* editing a video
* monitoring the news
* [[Internet Pastoral care]]
* answering questions
* [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]] photos and files
* managing other online volunteers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aidsvolunteers.ca/vvfacts/general.html#examples |title=What are examples of virtual volunteering? |accessdate=5 October 2009 |publisher=AIDSvolunteers.ca |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701081617/http://www.aidsvolunteers.ca/vvfacts/general.html#examples |archive-date=1 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.serviceleader.org/old/vv/examples.html |title=examples of virtual volunteering |accessdate=5 October 2009 |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519041848/http://www.serviceleader.org/old/vv/examples.html |archivedate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theextraordinaries.org/2008/11/make-a-difference-from-home-be-a-virtual-volunteer.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903075911/http://www.theextraordinaries.org/2008/11/make-a-difference-from-home-be-a-virtual-volunteer.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 September 2009 |title=Make a Difference From Home: Be a Virtual Volunteer |accessdate=5 October 2009 |publisher=theextraordinaries.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the developing world, innovative synergies between volunteerism and technology typically focus on [[mobile communication]] technologies rather than the Internet. Around 26 per cent of people worldwide had Internet access in 2009. However, Internet penetration in low-income countries was only 18 per cent, compared to over 64 per cent in developed countries. While the costs of fixed broadband Internet are falling, access still remains unaffordable to many.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). (2010). Measuring the information society . Geneva, Switzerland: ITU&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, online volunteering is developing rapidly. Online volunteers are "people who commit their time and skills over the Internet, freely and without financial considerations, for the benefit of society."&lt;ref&gt;Dhebar &amp; Stokes, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Online volunteering has eliminated the need for volunteerism to be tied to specific times and locations. Thus, it greatly increases the freedom and flexibility of volunteer engagement and complements the outreach and impact of volunteers serving in situ. Most online volunteers engage in operational and managerial activities such as fundraising, technological support, communications, marketing and consulting. Increasingly, they also engage in activities such as research and
writing and leading e-mail discussion groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Online ''[[micro-volunteering]]'' is also an example of virtual volunteering and [[crowdsourcing]], where volunteers undertake assignments via their [[PDA]]s or [[smartphones]]. These volunteers either aren't required to undergo any screening or training by the nonprofit for such tasks, and do not have to make any other commitment when a micro-task is completed, or, have already undergone screening or training by the nonprofit, and are therefore approved to take on micro-tasks as their availability and interests allow. Online micro-volunteering was originally called "byte-sized volunteering" by the Virtual Volunteering Project, and has always been a part of the more than 30-year-old practice of online volunteering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nonprofit.about.com/od/volunteers/a/microvol.htm |title=Volunteering - Get the Most From Volunteer Experience |publisher=Nonprofit.about.com |date=2014-05-14 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early example of both micro-volunteering and crowdsourcing is [[ClickWorkers]], a small NASA project begun in 2001 that engaged online volunteers in scientific-related tasks that required just a person's perception and common sense, but not scientific training, such as identifying craters on Mars in photos the project posted online; volunteers were not trained or screened before participating. The phrase "micro-volunteering" is usually credited to a San Francisco-based nonprofit called The Extraordinaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weeks |first=Linton |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106118736 |title=The Extraordinaries: Will Microvolunteering Work? |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amy Farnsworth |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Responsible-Tech/2009/0804/smart-phone-app-lets-you-do-good-deeds-in-your-spare-time |title=Smart-phone app lets you do good deeds in your spare time |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/assignment_7&amp;id=7162300 |title=San Francisco-based website offers micro-volunteering platform &amp;#124; abc7news.com |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=2009-12-09 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==

The practice of virtual volunteering to benefit nonprofit initiatives dates back to at least the early 1970s, when [[Project Gutenberg]] began involving online volunteers to provide electronic versions of works in the public domain.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;
{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, a new [[nonprofit organization]] called [[Impact Online]] (now called [[VolunteerMatch]]), based in Palo Alto, California, began promoting the idea of "virtual volunteers".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Impact Online received a grant from the [[James Irvine Foundation]] to launch an initiative to research the practice of virtual volunteering and to promote the practice to nonprofit organizations in the US. This new initiative was dubbed the [[Virtual Volunteering Project]], and the web site was launched in early 1997.&lt;ref&gt;

| location = [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; After one year of operations, the Virtual Volunteering Project moved to the Charles A. Dana Center at [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]]. In 2002, the Virtual Volunteering Project moved within the university to the [[Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs]]. The first two years of the Virtual Volunteer Project were spent reviewing and adapting [[telecommuting]] manuals&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and existing volunteer management guidelines with regarding to virtual volunteering, as well as identifying organizations that were involving online volunteers. By April 1999, almost 100 organizations had been identified by the Virtual Volunteering Project as involving online volunteers and were listed on the web site.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

| location = [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the growing numbers of nonprofit organizations, schools, government programs and other not-for-profit entities involving online volunteers, the Virtual Volunteering Project stopped listing every such organization involving online volunteers on its web site in 2000, and focused its efforts on promoting the practice, profiling organizations with large or unique online volunteering programs, and creating guidelines for the involvement of online volunteers. Until January 2001, the Virtual Volunteering Project listed all telementoring and teletutoring programs in the USA (programs where online volunteers mentor or tutor others, through a nonprofit organization or school). At that time, 40 were identified.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1999, the [[NetAid|NetAid.org]] initiative was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative included an online volunteering component, today known as the [[United Nations Volunteers#Online Volunteering|UN Online Volunteering service]]. It went live in 2000 and has been managed by [[United Nations Volunteers]] since its inception. It quickly attracted a high number of people ready to support organizations working for development. In 2003, several thousand people already contributed to the UN's Online Volunteering service – volunteers with very diverse backgrounds, including university graduates, private sector employees, and retirees.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; While the UN's Online Volunteering service became independent, NetAid continued as a joint project of [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] and Cisco Systems. It aimed "to utilize the unique networking capabilities of the Internet to promote development and alleviate extreme poverty across the world".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current state==

Online volunteering has been adopted by thousands of nonprofit organizations and other initiatives.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; There is no organization currently tracking best practices in online volunteering in the USA or worldwide, how many people are engaged in online volunteering, or how many organizations utilize online volunteers, and studies regarding volunteering, such as reports on volunteering trends in the USA, rarely include information about online volunteering (for example, a search of the term ''virtual volunteering'' on the [[Corporation for National Service]]'s "Volunteering in America" yields no results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Volunteering and Civic Life in America |url=http://www.volunteeringinamerica.gov/ |title=volunteeringinamerica.gov. Retrieved 24 September 2009 |publisher=Volunteeringinamerica.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On IVCO's Forum Discussion Paper 2015&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivco2015.org/conference/document/1005_Global_indicators_to_measure_volunteer_impact(Megan,%20Peter).pdf Megan Haddock &amp; Peter Devereux, Forum Discussion Paper 2015: Documenting the Contribution of Volunteering to the SDGs]&lt;/ref&gt; it is recommended that a collective measurement tool developed as part of a global measurement framework should also capture online volunteering.

The [[United Nations Volunteers#Online Volunteering|UN's Online Volunteering service]] connects organizations working in or for the developing world with online volunteers. It does have statistics available regarding numbers of online volunteers and involving organizations (i.e. NGOs, other civil society organizations, a government or other public institutions, United Nations agencies or other intergovernmental institutions) that collaborate online via their platform. In 2013, all 17,370 online volunteering assignments offered by development organizations through the Online Volunteering service attracted applications from numerous qualified volunteers. About 58 percent of the 11,037 online volunteers were women, and 60 percent came from developing countries; on average, they were 30 years of age. More than 94 percent of organizations and online volunteers rated their collaboration as good or excellent in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;About the UNV Online Volunteering service, Statistics: https://onlinevolunteering.org/en/org/about/statistics.html&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Non-governmental organization|civil society organizations]] with limited resources in particular, the impact of online volunteer engagement is significant: 41% involve UN Online Volunteers for technical expertise that is not available internally. According to the same impact evaluation carried out in 2014, in many instances, organizations without access to online volunteers would have difficulties achieving their own peace and development outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unv.org/annual-report-2014/pdf/Chapter_6.pdf UNV Annual Report 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, UNV unveiled a redesigned website and launched two additional services: The 1-click query to allow organizations to reach out to half a million people to provide real-time data for their projects, and its new employee online volunteering solution for global companies. Inclusive multi-stakeholder partnerships emerged as a necessity to achieve the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), and the first private sector partner of the Online Volunteering service is based in Brazil ([[Samsung Electronics]] Latin American Office).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unv.org/news/samsung-and-unv-announce-innovative-partnership-promote-volunteerism-achieving-sustainable|title=Samsung and UNV announce an innovative partnership to promote volunteerism for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - UNV|work=unv.org|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other matching services, such as [[VolunteerMatch]] and [[Idealist (organization)|Idealist]], also offer virtual volunteering positions with nonprofit organizations in addition to traditional, on-site volunteering opportunities. VolunteerMatch currently reports that about 5 percent of its active volunteer listings are virtual in nature. As of June 2010, its directory included more than 2,770 such listings including roles in interactive marketing, fundraising, accounting, social media, and business mentoring. The percentage of virtual listings has dropped since 2006, when it peaked at close to 8 percent of overall volunteer opportunities in the VolunteerMatch system.

[[Wikipedia]] and other [[Wikimedia Foundation]] endeavors are examples of online volunteering, in the form of crowdsourcing or micro-volunteering; the majority of Wikipedia contributing volunteers aren't required to undergo any screening or training by the nonprofit for their role as researchers, writers or editors, and do not have to make a specific time commitment to the organization in order to contribute service.

Many organizations involved in virtual volunteering might never mention the term, or the words "online volunteer," on their web sites or in organizational literature. For example, the nonprofit organization Business Council for Peace ([[Bpeace]]) recruits business professionals to donate their time mentoring entrepreneurs in conflict-affected countries, including [[Afghanistan]] and [[Rwanda]], but the majority of these volunteers interact with Bpeace staff and entrepreneurs online rather than face-to-face; yet, the term virtual volunteering is not mentioned on the web site. Bpeace also engages in online micro-volunteering, asking for information leads from its supporters, such as where to find online communities of particular professionals in the USA, but the organization never mentions the term micro-volunteering on its web site.  Another example is the [[Electronic Emissary]], one of the first K-12 online mentoring programs, launched in 1992; the web site does not use the phrase virtual volunteering and prefers to call online volunteers online [[subject matter expert]]s.

Evolving forms of volunteerism will enhance opportunities for people to volunteer. The spread of technology connects ever more rural and isolated areas. NGOs and governments are beginning to realise the value of South-to-South international volunteerism, as well as diaspora volunteering, and are dedicating resources to these schemes. Corporations are responding to the "social marketplace" by supporting [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] initiatives that include volunteerism. New opportunities for engaging in volunteerism are opening up with the result that more people are becoming involved and those already participating can expand their commitment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A phenomenon that is still quite new, but growing rapidly, is the formal integration of online employee volunteering programmes into the infrastructure and business plan of companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27755">'''Writing across the curriculum (WAC)''' is a movement within contemporary [[composition studies]] that concerns itself with writing in classes outside of composition, literature, and other English courses. According to a comprehensive survey performed in 2006–2007, approximately half of American institutes of higher learning have something that can be identified as a WAC program.&lt;ref&gt;Thaiss, Chris, and Tara Porter. "The State of WAC/WID in 2010: Methods and Results of the U.S. Survey of the International WAC/WID Mapping Project." College Composition and Communication. 61.3 (2010): 524–70. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

This page principally concerns itself with WAC in American colleges and universities. WAC has also been important in Britain, but primarily at the [[K–12]] level.

==History of WAC==
David Russell traces the history of WAC in the United States to the 1870s, the emergence of professional disciplines, and the new need for college-level instruction in writing.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, David R. Writing in the Academic Disciplines: A Curricular History. 2nd Ed. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this era, college students were exclusively (for all practical considerations) affluent white men whose natural discourse was identical to the approved discourse of the academy; therefore, their way of speaking and writing was already considered appropriate by and for the academy and composition didn't need to be taught at the college level. Two changes happened to motivate the need for college writing instruction. Firstly, as disciplines (as divisions within academic studies) and contemporary professions specialized, they developed their own specialized discourses. Because these discourses were not merely the same as the everyday discourse of the upper classes, they had to be taught. Secondly, as college students became more diverse – first in terms of social background and, later, in terms of gender, race, and age – not all college students grew up speaking the accepted language of the academy.

Clearly, composition courses couldn't be about the content of the writing, because content was what the other disciplines taught. Composition, therefore, had to be about the form the writing took and so "writing" was reduced to mechanics and style. Because of this reduced focus and because writing was addressed by composition, other disciplines assumed no responsibility for writing instruction; most students, then, were not taught to write in the context of their specialties. As American education became increasingly skills-oriented following World War II – in part a reaction to the suffusion of universities with war veterans in need of job training, in part a result of modeling education after the efficiency of Fordian factory production – writing instruction was further reduced to a set of skills to be mastered. Once correct (that is, standard academic) grammar, punctuation, spelling, and style were mastered – preferably before reaching the post-secondary level – there was no need for additional writing instruction save as [[remedial education]].

This product-oriented, skills-focused paradigm of writing pedagogy began to change in the 1970s with the popularization of [[James N. Britton|James Britton]] and colleagues' expressivist school of composition, which said that students benefited from writing as a tool for self-expression and that focusing on technical correctness was damaging. Janet Emig's 1977 article "Writing as a Mode of Learning," grounded in [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist theories of education]], suggested that writing functioned as a unique and invaluable way for students to understand and integrate information. Simultaneously, widespread media attention around college students' apparently decreasing writing proficiency (more a product of the changing demographics of college students than an overt shift in teaching) provoked institutions of higher learning to reevaluate and increase the amount of writing required of students. [[Carleton College]] and Beaver College began what were probably the first contemporary WAC programs in 1974 and 1975, respectively, with faculty workshops and writing requirements shared across disciplines.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt;

In 2010, Thaiss and Porter defined WAC as "a program or initiative used to 'assist teachers across disciplines in using student writing as an instructional tool in their teaching'".&lt;ref&gt;Thaiss, Chris, and Tara Porter. "The State of WAC/WID in 2010: Methods and Results of the U.S. Survey of the International WAC/WID Mapping Project." College Composition and Communication. 61.3 (2010): 524–70. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; WAC, then, emerged as and remains a way to bring writing back to disciplines which had become accustomed to assigning relatively little of it. WAC has also been part of the student-centered pedagogies movement ([[student-centred learning]]) seeking to replace teaching via one-way transmission of knowledge from teacher to student with more interactive strategies that enable students to interact with and participate in creating knowledge in the classroom.

==Major theories==
WAC efforts are usually driven principally by one of two theories: writing to learn or on learning to write in disciplinary discourses, sometimes also called writing in the disciplines. Though both may be used together, one of the two theories generally guides any given writing assignment and, often, any given WAC course.

===Writing to learn===
Writing to learn is also occasionally referred to as the expressivist or cognitive mode of WAC.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Susan H. "Writing Across the Curriculum: An Introduction." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 1–11. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt; Writing to learn supports the use of mostly informal, often ungraded writing exercises to help students understand course content in non-English disciplines. Writing to learn assumes that being able to explain or express concepts in one's own words both builds and reflects understanding. Because the goal of writing to learn exercises is learning rather than a finished writing product, instructors are discouraged from paying attention to grammar and surface mechanics. The student himself or herself, not the teacher, is the audience. Common writing to learn exercises include reading responses, journals, [[free writing]], and multiple forms of collaborative writing.

===Writing in the disciplines===
Writing in the disciplines is also occasionally referred to as the transactional or rhetorical mode of WAC.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Susan H. "Writing Across the Curriculum: An Introduction." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 1–11. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the Disciplines (WID) teaches students how to write acceptably in their respective disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Sutton. "Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper." Language and Learning Across the Disciplines. (1997): 46-57. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/llad/v2n1/sutton.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the Disciplines classes teach students to learn to write texts that they will apply in their scholarly and professional lives.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Susan H. "Writing Across the Curriculum: An Introduction." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 1–11. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt; Although WID and WAC are correlated, WID emphasizes disciplinary orientation. The students’ participation in their majors enlists the students in [[discourse communities]], which are social groups that communicate, at least in part, via written texts and share common goals, values, and writing standards. These writing standards include but are not limited to specialized vocabularies and particular genres.&lt;ref&gt;Academic Writing Program. "What is "Writing in the Disciplines?"" Faculty of Art and Science, Academic Writing Program. University of Lethbridge, 2006. &lt;/ref&gt; The goal of WID is to allow students to demonstrate writing skills within the genres expected in academic and professional discourse communities.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Bazerman. "Encyclopedia of English Studies "Writing in the Disciplines". Southern Illinios UP, 1993.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the discipline courses are commonly referred to as Writing Intensive courses(WI).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McLeod |first1=Susan H. |last2=Soven |first2=Margot |title=Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs|publisher=WAC Clearinghouse Landmark Publications in Writing Studies |date=2000 |chapter=Chapter 6: Writing-Intensive Courses: Tools for Curricular Change |url=https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing Intensive courses were developed for two reasons: 1) Students' writing skills would decrease if not consistently reinforced. 2) Students' writing improves significantly when they write involving their major.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The controversy surrounding WID is who holds responsibility for teaching WID courses. The different models for teaching WID classes are the following: 1) The English department faculty teaches writing courses focused on individual disciplines. 2) English departments and other discipline departments collaborate on instructing writing courses for particular majors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 3) Individual faculty of respective disciplines teach writing for their respective disciplines.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jonathan|first=Monroe,|date=2003-10-01|title=Writing and the Disciplines|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-592166031/writing-and-the-disciplines|journal=Peer Review|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|issn=1541-1389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars agree that each university decides which model works best for their institution. The University of San Francisco has implemented model one to teach their [https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/course/203-writing-psychology Writing in Psychology course(RHET 203)].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cornell University has used model two to teach their [http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=31&amp;coid=494579 Technical Writing course(WRIT 7100)].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The University of Missouri employs the third model to teach their [https://cwp.missouri.edu/wi/courses/spring-2018/ Process Synthesis and Design course - Writing Intensive(CH_ENG 4980W)]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

==WAC structure and implementation==
WAC may exist as a formal program housed in or attached to an English department, a formal program as a free-standing unit reporting directly to a dean or vice president, a program attached to an all-campus [[writing center]], or an informal initiative in which faculty voluntarily participate. The WAC director, at most universities, is a tenure-track professor.&lt;ref&gt;Thaiss, Chris, and Tara Porter. "The State of WAC/WID in 2010: Methods and Results of the U.S. Survey of the International WAC/WID Mapping Project." College Composition and Communication. 61.3 (2010): 524–70. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; WAC programs are often administered by a WAC director, frequently with the aid of a WAC faculty committee, and are sometimes staffed by undergraduate or graduate student assistants (also referred to as tutors, consultants, or fellows.)

===WAC workshops===
Workshops at which faculty from many disciplines meet to share ideas about and strategies around writing are a primary way in which WAC is enacted.&lt;ref&gt;Walvoord, Barbara E. "Getting Started." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 12–31. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thaiss, Chris, and Tara Porter. "The State of WAC/WID in 2010: Methods and Results of the U.S. Survey of the International WAC/WID Mapping Project." College Composition and Communication. 61.3 (2010): 524–70. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Workshops serve multiple functions including:
* Encouraging community amongst faculty interested in WAC&lt;ref&gt;Magnotto, Joyce Neff and Barbara R. Stout. "Faculty Workshops." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 32–46. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allowing WAC faculty (often, but not always from English or composition studies) to share knowledge about writing to learn, writing process, providing student feedback, and other composition scholarship
* Providing a forum for open discussion about writing and teaching
* Giving faculty themselves an opportunity to experiment with different writing strategies including collaborative writing and peer-review and to experience something of how these strategies may feel for their students&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, Karen Wiley. "Starting a WAC Program: Strategies for Administrators." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 47–57. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt;

A major complaint against the workshop model of WAC is that it can encourage the mindset that writing pedagogy is relatively simple and can be mastered in a few days, whereas using writing effectively (in English or non-English classes) is widely recognized as taking years of practice.&lt;ref&gt;Ochsner, Robert, and Judy Fowler. "Playing Devil's Advocate: Evaluating the Literature of the WAC/WID Movement." Review of Educational Research 74.2 (2004): 117 -140. Web. 1 Sept. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===WAC in upper-division courses===
On a programmatic level, WAC most often manifests as some kind of writing-intensive (also called writing-enriched or writing-in-the-major) courses. Courses carrying this designation typically meet university-wide criteria including a minimum number of pages or words students write over the semester (or some other measure of writing frequency), opportunity for revision, and deriving a significant portion of the final grade from writing. Writing-intensive courses also often have relatively small enrollment limits (15–35 students depending on institution) and may require faculty to participate in WAC-related professional development activities.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, Christine and Raymond Smith. "Writing-Intensive Courses: Tools for Curricular Change." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 71–86. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale for writing-intensive coursework includes:
* ''Writing practice'' – as with any other skill, students' writing abilities will atrophy if they are left unpracticed; writing-intensive courses ensure that students continue to write after leaving [[first-year composition]]
* ''Writing to learn'' – contemporary composition theory holds that incorporating active writing promotes student engagement and, therefore, learning
* ''Professionalization'' – writing-intensive courses directed at upper-division major students provide an opportunity for students to learn the communication skills expected of professionals in their anticipated fields

===WAC in first-year composition===
While WAC is usually understood as distributing writing across the curriculum in courses outside of English departments, a WAC philosophy can also influence the structure of first-year composition courses. Because first-year composition is often the only writing course students take, the composition of the class can shape students' understanding of what writing is.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Linda H. "Writing Across the Curriculum and/in the Freshman English Program." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 58–70.Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating writing from diverse academic genres can therefore expand students' expectations about what constitutes "writing." WAC in first-year composition owes much to genre theory ([[genre studies]]) which asks students to think about the classification and rhetorical implications of writing within socially constructed genres.

== Writing-Enriched Curriculum ==
'''Writing-Enriched Curriculum (or WEC)''' is a movement that scholars have recently started to implement in composition programs across the U.S. With its basic premise reflecting WAC's integration of writing throughout all student's courses, WEC aims to focus on faculty involvement in devising a writing program that is effective and relevant for students in their various fields &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Writing-Enriched Curriculum|url=https://wec.umn.edu/|website=University of Minnesota|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Precursors of WEC ===
In the late 1990's, North Carolina State University developed an approach to writing across the curriculum that involved extensive consultation by writing experts with individual departments. These consultations began with a focus on the qualities and characteristics faculty felt that student majors would exhibit if they were strong communicators. Those discussions led to the articulation of learning outcomes for both writing and oral communication. The departments then developed implementation plans that could help them reach the outcomes, followed or preceded by plans for assessing student abilities in order to further refine or project plans for implementation. &lt;ref&gt;Carter, Michael (2003) A Process for Establishing Outcomes-Based Assessment Plans for Writing and Speaking in the Disciplines, Language and Learning Across the Disciplines, 6:1, 4-29. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/llad/v6n1/carter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;Anson, Chris M. (2006) Assessing Writing in Cross-Curricular Programs: Determining the Locus of Activity. Assessing Writing, 11, 100-112.&lt;/ref&gt; The Campus Writing and Speaking Program, directed since 1999 by Distinguished Professor Chris Anson (www.ansonica.net), provided much of the support for this campus-wide approach. A few years into the program's existence, Anson and colleague Michael Carter (who is often credited with originating the departmentally-focused conversations on which WEC is founded) consulted with Pamela Flash at the University of Minnesota (where Anson had been a professor for 15 years) to help them spearhead a similar effort. Minnesota branded their program and design "WEC," although now the acronym is becoming generalized as other institutions adopt the approach.

WEC is a developing concept relating to WAC; the acronym was created by Pamela Flash and her colleagues at The University of Minnesota. Flash is the university's director of Writing Across the Curriculum, founding director of the Writing-Enriched Curriculum and co-director of the writing center. &lt;ref&gt;Heidi E. Wagner, A. Peter Hilger &amp; Pamela Flash (2014) Improving Writing Skills of Construction Management Undergraduates: Developing Tools for Empirical Analysis of Writing to Create Writing-Enriched Construction Management Curriculum,International Journal of Construction Education and Research, 10:2, 111-125, DOI: 10.1080/15578771.2013.852146&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;"Search Results", American Library Association, January 18, 2018.

Document ID: 019c5924-9dc0-4eaa-929a-9aeff57bd454&lt;/ref&gt; As a pioneer of the WEC writing instruction model, the University of Minnesota  has had its faculty enroll up to 5 units of WEC plans per year into the undergraduate curriculum for up to 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wec.umn.edu/about|title=About|last=hinte019|date=2016-10-06|work=WEC|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The WEC model ===
According to the WEC website at the University of Minnesota,&lt;Writing-Enriched Curriculum Program&gt; &lt;/https://wec.umn.edu/&gt; WEC is a faculty-driven method to ensuring the effective, intentional integration of relevant writing and writing instruction into disciplinary curricula. The WEC model created by Writing Across the Curriculum director Pamela Flash and colleagues and initially implemented by the University of Minnesota involves departmental faculty in developing a locally relevant Writing Plan. The outlining of plans is attempted through collaborative discussions between numerous departmental faculty and specialists in both writing and assessment and the consideration of previous attempts at effective writing instruction. Some of the content under consideration include writing assessments, locally collected data, stakeholder surveys and writing expectations from instructors. The outcome of this meetings is pronounced expectations and plans for relevant instructions to be implemented in the curricula. &lt;ref&gt; (Flash 2016 Fr o m A ppr i s e d to Revi s e d Faculty in the Disciplines Change What They Never Knew They Knew) https://wec.umn.edu/sites/wec.umn.edu/files/flash_chapter2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The next step is the application of the plan into the undergraduate curriculum and assessing Undergraduate Writing Plans. Integrating the WEC model is anticipated to show improvements in writing instruction at a rate that would meet faculty expectations. Each of three writing plans is tested for 1-3 academic years through multiple outlets; internal curricular study and structural changes, material development, writing workshops, seminars, and panels, and additional research. The feasibility of each edition of these writing plans is assessed by a subcommittee of the Faculty Senate; the Campus Writing Board. Contributions to writing plan assessment include triennial panel ratings of student writing against faculty expectations and criteria. The results are then used to guide future writing plans. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wec.umn.edu/wec-model|title=WEC Model|last=mollyb|date=2017-03-27|work=WEC|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The principles of WAC and the WEC model ===
Because WEC closely reflects WAC, the principles that Barbara Walvoord&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walvoord|first1=Barbara|title=Getting Started. In Writing‐across‐the‐Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs|publisher=Sage|location=Newbury Park, CA|pages=9-22|url=https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod_soven}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives to devise a WAC program are similar to Anson's Campus Writing and Speaking Program at NC State and Pamela Flash's WEC model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Writing-Enriched Curriculum Model|url=https://wec.umn.edu/wec-model|website=University of Minnesota|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Minnesota. James K. Elmborg's work on information literacy and WAC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elmborg|first1=James|title=Information literacy and Writing across the Curriculum: sharing the vision|journal=Reference Services Review|volume=31|issue=1|page=68-80|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/00907320310460933|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes Walvoord's characteristics of creating a WAC program as:
* Including colleagues from various disciplines, including teaching assistants and students, as they will all be affected by the WAC program the most.
* Discussing what needs and concerns need to be met with a WAC program and who will be willing to dedicate time to implementing the curriculum.
* What changes will be made to address this-- whether it be in school-wide assessments, writing centers or classroom methods 
* School administrators will then oversee and facilitate WAC but should not be seen as dictators.

Similarly, both Anson's approach at NC State and Pamela Flash's model at the University of Minnesota reflect the same idea of coming together with faculty members from various fields throughout the curriculum and implementing these changes cohesively&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Writing Plans|url=https://wec.umn.edu/writing-plans|website=University of Minnesota|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The main point of difference between WAC and WEC, however, is that WEC requires faculty to maintain intentional support activity and assessment of how the program is affecting their students and to make changes, if necessary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research &amp; Assessment|url=https://wec.umn.edu/research-assessment|website=University of Minnesota|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. By comparison, WAC does not require routinely assessment as part of its model. Like WAC, Flash's WEC model also requires ongoing implementation and incremental direct and indirect assessment, which allows the faculty-implemented plans to sustain. Anson's program at NC State revisits departments to conduct "profiles" of their efforts, resulting in a formative report for the department's use&lt;ref&gt; Anson, Chris M., &amp; Dannels, D. P. (2009). Profiling Programs: Formative Uses of Assisted Descriptions in the Assessment of Communication Across the Curriculum. Across the Disciplines, 6 Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/docs/atd/assessment/anson_dannels.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to Flash, WEC differs from most WAC programming in its departmental locus and its direct focus on the ways that faculty members in diverse disciplines conceptualize writing and writing instruction. &lt;ref&gt;Flash, P. (2016) Flash, P. (2016). From apprised to revised: Faculty in the disciplines change what they never knew they knew. In Yancey, K.B. (Ed.) A Rhetoric of Reflection (pp. 227-249). Logan, UT: Utah State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
P.A. Ramsay, in his paper Writing across the curriculum: Integrating discourse communities in the academy, found that students that participate in WAC programs become better communicators in their chosen discipline and demonstrated improved critical/analytical thinking.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ramsay, P.A. (2008). ''Writing across the curriculum: Integrating discourse communities in the academy.'' Kingston, Jamaica: School of Education, University of West Indies.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Disadvantages of WAC include fears that the teaching style will reduce the available time to teach content material, difficuties getting teachers "on board" with the style, as well as fears that the teacher is illequipped to teach writing.Ramsay also found while working in [[Jamaica]], that students who were unable to compose in their first language (either because of academic defficiencies or because the language did not have a written language) had difficulties composing in their second language using WAC practices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This was a sentiment echoed by Alexander Friedlander, who in his research found that students unable to write in their first language will have great difficulty writing in their second language regardless of whether their instruction has used WAC strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, A. (1990). Composing in English: Effects of a first language on writing in English as a second language. In B.Kroll(Ed.), S''econd language writing: Research insights for the classroom'' (pp. 109-125).
