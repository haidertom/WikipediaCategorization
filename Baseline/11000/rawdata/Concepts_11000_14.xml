      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37118">'''[[Academic freedom]] in the Middle East''' is a contested and debated issue, which has caught regional and international attention. In the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa (MENA)]] region, in general, the authoritarian regimes have all showed a certain degree of opposition to every sort of freedom, academic one not excluded, regardless of the type of regime basis they had. Freedom for academicians to inquiry, research, teach and communicate ideas or report facts without being threatened or persecuted or with the possibility of losing their position, being censored or repressed is threatened. What contributes to academic freedom violations is also that they are essential elements for the regimes to maintain their power and in addition to this issue, interstate and civil wars as well as internal disorders and external intervention can damage educational structures and institutions. Additionally, as far as the regime is concerned, a security or national threat can be a pretest for suffocate or suspend academic research and debate. Restrictions on academic freedom also regards the topics of research, which are under significant constraints, although these might be highly interesting and worth researching.

==Background==
There are many organizations that deal with monitoring violations of academic freedom and report academicians' voices, through publishing letters directed to public figures and also directed to the international community.

===Scholars at Risk===
[[Scholars at Risk]] is an international network based in the United States, specifically at the University of Chicago. The aim of this organization is to support scholars and defend academic freedom and human rights all over the world. One of the projects of this network is the Academic Freedom Monitor.

====Reported cases from Academic Freedom Monitor====
The online website Academic Freedom Monitor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitoring.academicfreedom.info|title=Home Page - Academic freedom monitor|website=monitoring.AcademicFreedom.info|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; deals with reporting violations related to academic freedom. It is based on robust sources of information, which come from independent actors and are, then, verified. According to the Academic Freedom Monitor, which reports cases since 2010 until now, there are different categories of violation regarding the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitoring.academicfreedom.info|title=Home Page - Academic freedom monitor|website=monitoring.academicfreedom.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Regarding the Middle East and Northern Africa, the AFM registers cases in: Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Kuwait, Yemen, Iraq, Palestine (OPT), Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Libya and Tunisia.

==== Types of violations ====
Academic Freedom Monitor identifies different types of violations as following:
* Killings, violence or disappearances
* Wrongful imprisonment/detention
* Wrongful prosecution
* Restrictions on travel or movement
* Retaliatory discharge or loss of position/expulsion from study
* Other significant events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitoring.academicfreedom.info/monitoring|title=Monitoring - Academic freedom monitor|website=monitoring.AcademicFreedom.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Committee on Academic Freedom===
[[Middle East Studies Association of North America|The Middle East Studies Association (MESA)]] is an association which brings together scholars and informed people with an interested in the MENA region. This association is the promoter of the ''[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]'' and has the aim to promote cooperation, communication and boost the learning regarding the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mesana.org/about/index.html|title=About MESA|website=MESANA.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the fields it is dealing with regards academic freedom. This association has created a Committee on Academic Freedom (CAF), which aims to remove any obstacle regarding the exchange of knowledge and any restrictions on academicians coming also from governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mesana.org/committees/academic-freedom/index.html|title=Committee on Academic Freedom (CAF)|website=MESANA.org|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey==
=== History ===
Academic freedom in Turkey has been through a series of changes and fluctuations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Summak, M Semih. “Academic Human Rights and Freedoms in Turkey.” ''The Educational Forum'' 62, no. 1 (1997): 32–39. doi:10.1080/00131729708982678.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often irregular, inadequate and closely tied to the politics in the country.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Weiker, Walter F. “Academic Freedom and Problems of Higher Education in Turkey.” ''Middle East Journal'' 16, no. 3 (1962): 279–94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Balyer, Aydın. “Academic Freedom : Perceptions of Academics in Turkey Akademik Özgürlük : Türkiye ’ Deki Akademisyenlerin Algıları” 36, no. 162 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Norris, Kristin E, Academic Freedom and University Autonomy: A comparative analysis of the Turkish higher education system. (2011). http://hdl.handle.net/1805/2486&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Education in Turkey#History|reform]] initiatives have been taken throughout Turkey's history which aim at restructuring governance of higher education and thus affecting academic freedom.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Doğan, Didem. “Academic Freedom from the Perspectives of Academics and Students: A Qualitative Study.” ''TeEği̇ti̇m VBi̇li̇m'' 41, no. 184 (2016): 25–32. doi:10.15390/EB.2016.6135.&lt;/ref&gt; The first reform initiative was in 1933, as Malche was invited by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] to restructure [[Istanbul University|Istanbul University (Istanbul Darülfünun)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Üvey, Doðan|author2=Gökçe, Ayse Nur|title="The Role of Prof. Dr. Albert Malche in 1933 university reform in turkey." |journal=Acta - Congressus Historiae Pharmaciae|date=2001|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=1F25595219FD4268916676FA70A746DE?doi=10.1.1.613.7020&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One of the reforms that made it to the law 2252 was according [[List of universities in Turkey|universities]] with more freedom. In 1946, the Law Number 4936 accorded universities with unprecedented rights, as academicians were seen as guardians of democracy second to the military.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
The [[Democrat Party (Turkey, 1946–61)|Democratic Party]] in 1953 passed laws that would undermine the universities' control over their budget, retirement of academicians and their employment rights.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those attacks on academic freedom were aimed at confining professors from being involved in partisan politics resulting in several cases of suspensions of academicians and denial of promotions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|1960 coup]] was seen as a promise for reversal of the [[Democrat Party (Turkey, 1946–61)|DP]]'s encroachment over university autonomy, as it recruited academicians in government offices, selected to write the constitution and other vital roles. However, the 1960 coup junta surprisingly dismissed 147 academicians who were not in agreement with some members of the junta.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
In 1973, higher education was restructured with the increased sovereignty of the Interuniversity Council (ÜAK), while at the same time universities were given complete autonomy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== The Council of Higher Education (YÖK) ====
The current Higher Education Law was implemented in 1981 following the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|1980 coup]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The law maintains that, “universities are judicial structures which are managed and supervised by the organs selected among them. University organs, academics and teaching assistants cannot be removed from their posts for no reason by authorities outside the university” (YÖK 2007).&lt;ref&gt;The Council of Higher Education. ''The Law on Higher Education 1981''. The Republic of Turkey: Official Gazette No: 17506, published in English by Ankara Üniversitesi Basimevi (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Yet academic freedom became too dependent on [[Council of Higher Education (Turkey)|The Council of Higher Education (YÖK)]] as the reform moved towards creating a more centralized system around the YÖK in matters regarding budgetary control, staff employment and student selection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The law defines the name, number and discipline of each faculty or vocational school.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While universities can establish departments, their approval is subject to the Council.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Egypt==
===History===
Egypt is one of the countries where [[academic freedom]] is not a right freely enjoyed. Since the start of the 1990s, academics in Egypt have faced several forms of repression and endured many violations such as judicial convictions, public condemnation, and physical violence from both private individuals and groups, mainly the Islamists, and government officials.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 2005, p. 25"&gt;Human Rights Watch. “Reading between the "Red Lines”: The Repression of Academic Freedom in Egyptian Universities.” Vol. 17, No. 6, June 2005, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, there are Egyptian state authorities using [[Egyptian National Police|police]], political appointees, and regulations and laws to control university life. On the other hand, Islamist militants are resorting to physical violence and public attacks to have a say in the content of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch. “Reading between the "Red Lines”: The Repression of Academic Freedom in Egyptian Universities.” Vol. 17, No. 6, June 2005, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
All aspects of university life including the classroom, student activities, research, campus demonstrations were affected by government and private repression. The professors and students find themselves censored and enable to cross the “red lines” of politics, religion, and sex.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 2005, p. 25"/&gt;
Faculty appointments and promotions are controlled by the state. Student activities are limited once outside the classroom, and campus protests are often violently responded to. All these factors contribute to the deterioration of the academic freedom situation in Egypt and to the general decline of the educational environment.

====Sisi's era====
While Article 21 of the [[Constitution of Egypt|2014 Egyptian constitution]], issued under [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]]’s rule, ensures that “the state guarantees the independence of universities, scientific and linguistic academies” and that “it commits to providing university education in accordance with global quality criteria, and to developing free university education in state universities and institutes as per the law",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt’s Constitution of 2014|website=Constituteproject.org|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Egypt_2014.pdf|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Egyptian state still violates its constitutional provisions through various repressive ways in an attempt to curb academic freedom. Article 23 of the constitution claims that “the state grants the freedom of scientific research and encourages its institutions.”{{cite web|title=Egypt’s Constitution of 2014|website=Constituteproject.org|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Egypt_2014.pdf|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, freedom of scientific research has often been interfered with and even hindered on various occasions by state authorities. [[Egyptian universities|Universities]] under Sisi’s rule have been described as “experiencing the lowest levels of academic freedom the country has ever known."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Crane Linn, Emily. “Egypt’s Besieged Universities: The Country’s Scholars had better teach from President Sisi’s Textbook- or else.” Foreign Policy. 31 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many observers maintained that the violations against Egyptian academics under [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi|El-Sisi]]’s rule exceed those witnessed during [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak’s]] time. In academic year 2014, 761 student arrests and 281 student expulsions took place.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Moreover, the state sentenced to death a university professor for writing critical articles about the regime and accused him of “conspiring to undermine Egypt’s national security”,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and arrested many others who dared to criticize the regime.
The state also monitors what ideas come in and not just the research that comes out. Several universities are canceling their study abroad programs or breaking off their cooperations with foreign universities. For example, Cairo’s [[Ain Shams University]] canceled its study abroad program to Turkey and [[Damanhour University]] stopped its cooperation with foreign institutions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Furthermore, El-Sisi issued a decree banning any academic travel outside Egypt that does not have a prior [[State Security Investigations Service|State Security]] authorization. This way, the state would be able to control which conferences can be attended and what sources can be used. Even though this decree and many other violations are, according to the articles mentioned above, unconstitutional, they are still enforced.

===Violations===
There are various cases of academic freedom violations in Egypt. The following are just few of them. Professor Kholoud Saber had her scholarship abroad terminated by [[Cairo University]]. She was doing a doctoral research on a scholarship at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]] in Belgium, that started on October 2015, when she was ordered to return to Egypt following a recommendation of the [[Ministry of Higher Education (Egypt)|Ministry of Higher education]] in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. Press Release: “Cairo’s University Decision Demonstrates the Erosion of University Independence and its Reliance on Dictates of Ministry of Higher Education, which acts as a Cover for Security Intervention in Universities.” 10 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Fanny Ohier, a French Master’s student, was arrested and later deported from Egypt. She was working on the [[April 6 Youth Movement]], a group banned by the government as it was accused of state defamation and espionage.&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 13"&gt;Scholars at Risk: Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. “Free to Think: Report of the Scholars at Risk Academic Freedom Monitoring Project.” 2016, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; She was not given any reason for her arrest by the Egyptian officials but she, reportedly, overheard police officers claiming “she had improper friends.”&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 13"/&gt;
On another instance, scholar and journalist Ismail Alexandrani was detained, on November 2015, upon his return Egypt from a workshop in Germany. The Egyptian embassy in Berlin had apparently advised the scholar, who happens to be “a vocal critic of human rights violations in Egypt and counterterrorism policy in the Sinai Peninsula,” not to turn up to the workshop titled “Deconstructing Islamist Egypt"&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 14"&gt;Scholars at Risk: Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. “Free to Think: Report of the Scholars at Risk Academic Freedom Monitoring Project.” 2016, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Mr. Alexandrani’s arrival to Egypt, his passport was confiscated and he was questioned for over 19 hours before getting arrested “on charges of ‘joining and supporting a terrorist organization’ and ‘spreading false news liable to disturb public security and harm public interest."&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 14"/&gt;

===Giulio Regeni case===
One of the most widely covered stories in relation to the situation of academic freedom in Egypt was the case of the Italian PhD candidate [[Giulio Regeni]], a researcher at the [[University of Cambridge]] in the UK. Giulio Regeni was first found dead, in the outskirts of Cairo, a week after he was declared missing on January 25, 2016, which coincided with the fifth anniversary of the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|Egyptian uprising]], and his body demonstrated clear signs of torture and severe beating.&lt;ref name="scholarsatrisk.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scholars at Risk: Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. "Free to Think: Report of the Scholars at Risk Academic Freedom Monitoring Project."|date=2016|url=https://www.scholarsatrisk.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Free_to_Think_2016.pdf|format=PDF|website=Scholarsatrisk.org|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PhD candidate was investigating the [[Trade unions in Egypt|Egyptian labor movements]] at the [[American University in Cairo|American University of Cairo]] at the time of his murder. While government officials maintained that Regeni was kidnapped and murdered by a gang, international and Egyptian human rights activists claim that he was actually targeted for his research by the Egyptian government.&lt;ref name="scholarsatrisk.org"/&gt;
The murder of Giulio Regeni remains unsolved. 
The case of the researcher, and the continuing imprisonment of hundreds of scholars and thousands of students and the various restrictions on academic freedom signal that there is an actual “not improvement but, rather, a further tightening of control, and loss of autonomy and freedom in Egyptian higher education, as well as a shrinkiHing{{clarify|date=June 2017}} space for critical inquiry and discourse in Egypt generally."&lt;ref name="scholarsatrisk.org"/&gt;

==Israel==
{{POV|date=March 2017}}

=== History ===
In the 1990s, Israeli academia was characterized by open-mindedness and pluralist vision of debated issues such as revisionist history on [[1948 Palestine war|1948 war]] that was finding its way into the academic society.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Struggle for Academic Freedom in Israel|last=Pappe|first=Ilan|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the [[Second Intifada]] and its aftermath, these characteristics gradually vanished also due to the disappearance of [[Israeli Left|Israeli left]] parties, which in fact used to host a great part of Israeli academia and when leftish positions started to change, this influenced the academic environment as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Palestinian academia&lt;!-- This sub-section needs some attention. There are many statements made here that are not backed up with secondary sources. For this reason this section reads more like an academic paper than a Wikipedia article. Remember that it is necessary to write from as neutral a position as possible - so every statement you must ask yourself "would someone want to contest this claim?" and if yes ask yourself what you can do to back it up as much as possible. If you cannot find secondary sources for some of these ideas/statements than you need to remove them.   There are several instances in this sub-section where a secondary source is necessary to validate the statement - even if it an event, it must be validated with an external source.  --&gt; ===
In what it is considered by many international actors a situation of military occupation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories|title=Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories|website=Amnesty International USA|language=en|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/un-report-on-palestine-military-occupation-apartheid-torture-israeli-violations-are-deliberate-organised-and-institutionalised/5372212|title=UN Report on Palestine: Military Occupation, Apartheid, Torture – Israeli Violations are "Deliberate, Organised, and Institutionalised"|last=Falk|first=Richard|date=2014-03-07|website=Global Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its consequent policies of [[collective punishment]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/palestinians-israel-collective-punishment-160929083644838.html|title='Bad Palestinians' under Israel's collective punishment|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and denial of entrance&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;!-- A statement like this should be backed up with sources in order to demonstrate that it is not an opinion but actually 'fact'. Also it would be helpful if you could add more explanation when you write of 'collective punishments' and 'denial of entrance'. Remember that you are an expert on the topic, however other Wikipedia readers are not so these types of statements need some background information - even if you can provide sources and link it to another page that discusses this more thoroughly. --&gt;, such as checkpoints and the construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|wall]] between [[Israel]] and [[West Bank]], in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Occupied Palestinian Territories]] access to education for Palestinians has thus been affected&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brand|first=Laurie A.|year=2007|title=Middle East Studies and Academic Freedom: Challenges at Home and Abroad|url=|journal=International Studies Perspectives|volume=8|pages=385|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Again add a source to this claim. --&gt;. In fact, straight after the beginning of the [[first Intifada]], the ability for the students of West Bank Universities to study and carry on theirs studies have been limited, while later on, in 2006, a travel ban to get into Israel was issued for Palestinian students belonging to Israeli universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/ministers-demand-entry-into-israel-for-palestinian-students-1.202733|title=Ministers Demand Entry Into Israel for Palestinian Students|first1=Akiva|last1=Eldar|first2=Yoav|last2=Stern|date=18 October 2006|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; These procedure go along with a series of entry and residence denials for researchers and students, both foreign passport holders and Palestinian-born, which have threatened the ability of carrying on a proper educational and research level in Palestinian universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kibush.co.il/downloads/Letter_from_University_Presidents.pdf|format=PDF|title=To Members of Global Civil Society and Academia|website=Kibush.co.il|access-date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] reported various violations perpetrated by Israeli authorities on students, in the academic and educational environment. In 2007, 670 students from Gaza were prevented from achieving higher education in countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Germany, Britain and United States, by being denied the exit permits. In total, the number of Gazans who have been denied to exit Gaza has reached 6400 people and this due to Hamas’ takeover of the territory and Israel controlling Gaza’s border. Those students that left for their studies remained once again trapped when they returned home for the summer. Even when they obtained exit permits, students have been stopped at the passenger crossing in [[Erez]], with the justification of “security concerns”.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2007/11/19/gaza-israel-blocks-670-students-studies-abroad|title=Gaza: Israel Blocks 670 Students from Studies Abroad|date=2007-11-19|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/06/02/us-challenge-israels-restrictions-gaza-students|title=US: Challenge Israel’s Restrictions on Gaza Students|date=2008-06-02|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, the organization again stated how discrimination by Israeli authorities prevented many Palestinian students from the [[Gaza Strip]] to travel abroad or to the West Bank to get a better education&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch" /&gt;&lt;!-- where are your sources for this? --&gt;. Regarding the chances to travel abroad, in 2008, grants allocated for the Palestinians chosen to study in the United States were redirected because there was no way those students would be allowed by Israel to leave Gaza. For the inability to get visa, the grants destined to Gaza students were transferred to students in the West Bank. The organization has highlighted the necessity and the right for those students to access higher education abroad, since in the Gaza Strip the opportunity are quite limited. For instance, there is not a wide range of degrees, both undergraduate and master’s, in the four available universities. Moreover, there is a total absence of doctoral degrees, and lecturers and teachers from outside are hardly allowed by the Israeli government to enter and teach in Gaza.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/06/01/letter-secretary-state-condoleeza-rice-gazan-students|title=Letter to Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice on Gazan Students|date=1 June 2008|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=12 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This blockade is said to be a clear violation of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], because Israel’s obligation to guarantee the rights of the people under occupation, among which freedom of movement and right to education display, is inconsistent or not committed at all.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"/&gt; However, according to international law, Gaza is not occupied since Israel no longer has any military presence in Gaza and Gaza has its own, independent government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/11/13/why-gaza-is-not-remotely-occupied-i/|title=Why Gaza is not remotely occupied (I)|first=Eugene|last=Kontorovich|date=13 November 2014|publisher=|access-date=18 December 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of restrictions regarding [[academic freedom]] affects also Israeli scholars, such as [[Ilan Pappé|Ilan Pappe]], an Israeli Jew, who has been forced to resign for the [[University of Haifa]] in 2007 for his academic work and political positions, such as academic boycott of Israel. The scholar started researching on the history of the creation of the state of Israel and elaborated a revisionist historical perspective regarding 1948 war. He received along with his family death threats.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In an interview with [[Ma'an News Agency|Ma’an News]], in February 2014, he was asked about academic freedom in Israel and especially regarding his personal experience. This is what he stated:

“Freedom of academic expression in Israel is a bit like the idea of a Israel being a Jewish democracy. You take a universal concept -- everyone has the right to their opinion and everyone has the right to be part of a democracy -- only with one condition: that the universality does not include critique on Zionism and that the democracy would always ensure Jewish majority whatever the demographic and geographical realities are.”&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?ID=664867|title=Interview: Ilan Pappe on academic freedom in Israel and BDS|website=Maan News Agency|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iran ==
=== History ===
During the years that followed the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Iranian revolution]], hundreds of academicians and students were killed as a consequence of a highly violent campaign that aimed to repress academic freedom, silence dissent, and enforce uniformity of thought.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Sheehan, Ivan Sascha. “Iran’s Assault on Academic Freedom.” ''The Hill''. November 9, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The freedoms of speech, association, and peaceful assembly of thousands of students and faculty members were breached through various methods of brutality, torture and detention. The reasons behind the arrests and torture ranged from “participating in illegal gatherings”, “propaganda against the system”, to “insulting the supreme leader or government officials.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Other tens of thousands of students and faculty members were forced out of their education and careers and into exile.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These assaults on academic freedom continued all throughout the 1980s and became a salient feature of the newly established republic. Paradoxically, it was in universities where the initial revolutionary ‘texts’, aimed to oust the Shah, were produced and circulated.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Indeed, universities came to represent the de facto ‘spaces’ where open-ended critical discourse was taking place. Nevertheless, they became the primary target of attack after the fall of the monarchy and the rise of [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]] to power.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Contemporary Era ====
A merciless{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2017}} campaign of repression has been waged by the Iranian authorities against [[academic freedom]] during the last three decades. Academics and students were routinely detained, harassed and expelled from universities because of their beliefs, political affiliations and peaceful activism.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Amnesty International. “Persecution in Universities as Iran ‘squeezes the life out of’ academic freedom.” ''Amnesty.org.'' June 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of coercion and repressive methods was stepped up after the election of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The latter attempted to ‘Islamize’ the educational curriculum through purging it from secular and ‘Western’ influences. Furthermore, a large number of students and academics were barred from universities, following a policy of “starring” that punished those who do not conform to the state's political and social views. The government of President Ahmadinejad also introduced a quota system to limit the number of women in universities and measures to prevent them from enrolling in a list of courses considered more appropriate for men.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A firm iron grip was retained over academic institutions by the Iranian authorities to the degree of allowing intelligence bodies and state security to supervise disciplinary proceedings in universities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The next president who assumed office in 2013, [[Hassan Rouhani]]—considered by many as a ‘reformist’-, made some steps to permit the return of several banned academics and students to campuses.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Nonetheless, the situation of academic freedom remained critical with hundreds of students still imprisoned and others newly arrested since the election of President [[Hassan Rouhani|Rouhani]]. By the end of the academic year under the administration of the latter, various restrictions breaching academic freedom and introduced during the time of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] remained in place.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Violations ===
Several international instruments, to which Iran is party and accepted, such as the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights ([[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]]), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ([[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]]), and the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education clearly guarantee the right to education to all people without discrimination.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Human Rights Watch. “Iran: Government Assault on Academic Freedom.” ''Human Rights Watch''. May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, the rights of individuals to freedoms of association, expression, opinion, and assembly and the prohibition of discrimination based on sex, race, religion, ethnicity or political opinion, are further protected by the International Covenant on Civil and political Rights ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]) and the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ([[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|CERD]]).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

However, students and academics in Iran still face pervasive and routine infringements of their rights based on gender, religion, ethnicity and opinions. In the period stretching from March 2009 to February 2012, 396 cases of students were reportedly banned from their university programs because of their peaceful activism.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; At least 634 other students were detained by the intelligence and security network.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Student activists were suspended, threatened, arrested and prosecuted on a regular basis due to their peaceful criticism of the regime. Iranian officials have also resorted to shutting down hundreds of student publications, gatherings, and independent organizations.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Moreover, the intelligence and paramilitary agencies are strongly present in university campuses and sometimes violently confront students through attacking peaceful gatherings or dormitories, which often leads to grave injuries and even the death of many students. Furthermore, the minorities living in the republic of Iran are confronted with systematic discrimination and deprivation in universities. One example illustrating this case is that of the Baha’i community who are prevented from pursuing higher education because of their different religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Iranian authorities also specifically punish student activists advocating for ethnic minority rights in harsher ways. The punishments range from violent arrests to heavy sentences including the death sentence. Women are also subject to discrimination at the educational level. The establishment of a quota system to limit female participation in universities is curbing women’s rights. Further restrictions on women’s educational choices are enforced. The issue of gender segregation, which does not always guarantee quality education for women, persists. Academics and teaching personnel are also subject to discrimination with their rights constantly violated. More than a hundred academics were dismissed from universities, because of their dissent against the government and their political views, since the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 election]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In addition to that, several university professors have been imprisoned for merely expressing peaceful dissent.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== The case of Professor [[Homa Hoodfar]] ===
A Canadian-Iranian professor of anthropology from [[Concordia University]] in Montreal, [[Homa Hoodfar]], was detained in Iran on the 6th of June, 2016.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Bothwell, Ellie. “Professor Imprisoned in Iran: Academic Freedom ‘Not a Western import’.” ''Times Higher Education News''. December 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She was interrogated for three months before being locked in a small cell in [[Evin Prison]] by the Iranian intelligence service.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Evin Prison|Evin prison]] in Iran is referred to as ‘Evin University’ due to the large number of intellectuals detained there.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Professor [[Homa Hoodfar|Hoodfar]] spent 112 days in prison for meddling in affairs of “feminism and security matters.” She was released in September 2016 on “humanitarian grounds” after Canada’s cooperation with officials from Oman, Switzerland and Italy to ensure her release.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Canada worked with the latter countries because it cut its direct diplomatic ties with Iran in 2012.

Professor [[Homa Hoodfar|Hoodfar]] later reported that even though she was not physically abused, the interrogations were severely psychologically distressing.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The questioning would last from 9am to 7pm in a basement, where professor [[Homa Hoodfar|Hoodfar]] would either be facing a wall or a mirror preventing her from seeing her interrogators.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; As examples of psychological abuse, the professor revealed that one day, during questioning, Iranian officials played a song from her husband’s funeral that took place two years before, after they had found a clip of it on her iPad. In another instance, they displayed a picture of “her mother standing at her father’s graveside.”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[granular material]] is the steepest angle of descent or [[Strike and dip|dip]]  relative to the horizontal plane to which a material can be piled without slumping. At this angle, the material on the slope face is on the verge of sliding. The angle of repose can range from 0° to 90°. The morphology of the material affects the angle of repose; smooth, rounded sand grains cannot be piled as steeply as can rough, interlocking sands. The angle of repose can also be affected by additions of solvents. If a small amount of water is able to bridge the gaps between particles, electrostatic attraction of the water to mineral surfaces will increase the angle of repose, and related quantities such as the [[bearing capacity|soil strength]].

When bulk granular materials are poured onto a horizontal surface, a [[cone (geometry)|conical]] pile will form. The internal angle between the surface of the pile and the horizontal surface is known as the angle of repose and is related to the [[density]], [[surface area]] and shapes of the particles, and the [[coefficient of friction]] of the material. Material with a low angle of repose forms flatter piles than material with a high angle of repose.

The term has a related usage in [[mechanics]], where it refers to the maximum angle at which an object can rest on an [[inclined plane]] without sliding down. This angle is equal to the [[arctangent]] of the [[coefficient of static friction]] ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; between the surfaces.

== Applications of theory ==
[[File:TalusConesIsfjorden.jpg|thumb|280px|Talus cones on north shore of [[Isfjord (Svalbard)|Isfjord]], [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]], showing angle of repose for coarse [[sediment]]]]

The angle of repose is sometimes used in the design of equipment for the processing of particulate solids. For example, it may be used to design an appropriate [[chute (gravity)|hopper]] or [[silo]] to store the material, or to size a [[conveyor belt]] for transporting the material. It can also be used in determining whether or not a slope (of a stockpile, or uncompacted gravel bank, for example) will likely collapse; the [[scree|talus]] slope is derived from angle of repose and represents the steepest slope a pile of granular material will take. This angle of repose is also crucial in correctly calculating [[slope stability|stability]] in vessels.

It is also commonly used by [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]] as a factor in analysing [[avalanche]] danger in mountainous areas.{{citation needed |date=December 2016}}

== Measurement ==
There are numerous methods for measuring angle of repose and each produces slightly different results. Results are also sensitive to the exact methodology of the experimenter. As a result, data from different labs are not always comparable. One method is the [[triaxial shear test]], another is the [[direct shear test]].

If the coefficient of static friction is known of a material, then a good approximation of the angle of repose can be made with the following function. This function is somewhat accurate for piles where individual objects in the pile are minuscule and piled in random order.&lt;ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan{(\theta)} \approx \mu_\mathrm{s}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the coefficient of static friction, and ''θ'' is the angle of repose.

=== Methods in determining the angle of repose ===
The measured angle of repose may vary with the method used.

==== Tilting box method ====
This method is appropriate for fine-grained, non-cohesive materials with individual particle size less than 10&amp;nbsp;mm. The material is placed within a box with a transparent side to observe the granular test material. It should initially be level and parallel to the base of the box. The box is slowly tilted until the material begins to slide in bulk, and the angle of the tilt is measured.

==== Fixed funnel method ====
The material is poured through a funnel to form a cone. The tip of the funnel should be held close to the growing cone and slowly raised as the pile grows, to minimize the impact of falling particles. Stop pouring the material when the pile reaches a predetermined height or the base a predetermined width. Rather than attempt to measure the angle of the resulting cone directly, divide the height by half the width of the base of the cone. The inverse tangent of this ratio is the angle of repose.

==== Revolving cylinder method ====
The material is placed within a cylinder with at least one transparent end. The cylinder is rotated at a fixed speed and the observer watches the material moving within the rotating cylinder. The effect is similar to watching clothes tumble over one another in a slowly rotating clothes dryer. The granular material will assume a certain angle as it flows within the rotating cylinder. This method is recommended for obtaining the dynamic angle of repose, and may vary from the static angle of repose measured by other methods.

== Exploitation by antlion and wormlion (Vermileonidae) larvae ==
[[File:Antlion trap.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Sand pit trap of the antlion]]

The larvae of the [[antlion]]s and the unrelated wormlions [[Vermileonidae]] trap small insects such as ants by digging conical pits in loose sand, such that the slope of the walls is effectively at the critical angle of repose for the sand.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They achieve this by flinging the loose sand out of the pit and permitting the sand to settle at its critical angle of repose as it falls back. Thus, when a small insect, commonly an ant, blunders into the pit, its weight causes the sand to collapse below it, drawing the victim toward the center where the predator that dug the pit lies in wait under a thin layer of loose sand. The larva assists this process by vigorously flicking sand out from the center of the pit when it detects a disturbance. This undermines the pit walls and causes them to collapse toward the center. The sand that the larva flings also pelts the prey with so much loose, rolling material as to prevent it from getting any foothold on the easier slopes that the initial collapse of the slope has presented. The combined effect is to bring the prey down to within grasp of the larva, which then can inject venom and digestive fluids.

'''Animal consciousness''', or '''animal awareness''', is the [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] or state of self-awareness within an animal, or of being aware of an external object or something within itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=consciousness|publisher=Merriam-Webster|location=|accessdate=22 April 2014|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="van_Gulick2004"&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert van Gulick |year=2004 |title=Consciousness |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, [[consciousness]] has been defined as: [[sentience]], [[awareness]], [[subjectivity]], [[qualia]], the ability to [[experience]] or to [[feeling|feel]], [[wakefulness]], having a sense of [[self]]hood, and the executive control system of the mind.&lt;ref name=Farthing1992Psychology&gt;{{cite book| title=The Psychology of Consciousness |author=Farthing G |year=1992 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-728668-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers believe there is a broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is.&lt;ref name="John Searle 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=John Searle |author-link=John Searle |year=2005 |editor=Honderich T |title=The Oxford companion to philosophy |chapter=Consciousness |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926479-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The topic of animal consciousness is beset with a number of difficulties. It poses the [[problem of other minds]] in an especially severe form because animals, lacking the ability to use human language, cannot tell us about their experiences.&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{cite web |author=Colin Allen |title=Animal consciousness |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/consciousness-animal/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it is difficult to reason objectively about the question, because a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not feel, its life has no value, and that harming it is not morally wrong. The 17th-century French philosopher [[René Descartes]], for example, has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of animals because he argued that only humans are conscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peter Carruthers |author-link=Peter Carruthers (philosopher) |title=Sympathy and subjectivity |journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy |year=1999 |volume=77 |pages=465–482 |doi=10.1080/00048409912349231 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers who consider subjective experience the essence of consciousness also generally believe, as a correlate, that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known. The American philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]] spelled out this point of view in an influential essay titled ''[[What Is it Like to Be a Bat?]]''. He said that an organism is conscious "if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like ''for'' the organism"; and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal's brain and behavior, we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in the way it does itself.&lt;ref name=NagelBat&gt;{{cite book| author=Thomas Nagel| author-link=Thomas Nagel|title=Mortal Questions |chapter=Ch. 12 What is it like to be a bat? |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-521-40676-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other thinkers, such as the cognitive scientist [[Douglas Hofstadter]], dismiss this argument as incoherent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Douglas Hofstadter |author-link=Douglas Hofstadter |chapter=Reflections on ''What Is It Like to Be a Bat?'' |pages=403–414 |title=The Mind's I |editor=Douglas Hofstadter |editor-link=Douglas Hofstadter  |editor2=Daniel Dennett|editor2-link=Daniel Dennett |publisher=Basic Books |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-7108-0352-8|title-link=The Mind's I }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive—[[Donald Griffin]]'s 2001 book ''Animal Minds'' reviews a substantial portion of the evidence.&lt;ref name=Griffin2001&gt;{{cite book |title=Animal Minds: Beyond Cognition to Consciousness |author=Donald Griffin |author-link=Donald Griffin |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-226-30865-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OQGJz1DVQNMC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=%22On+the+origin+of+consciousness+%E2%80%94+some+amniote+scenarios%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22On%20the%20origin%20of%20consciousness%20%E2%80%94%20some%20amniote%20scenarios%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical background ==

[[File:Jan Baptist Weenix - Portrait of René Descartes.jpg|thumb|right|René Descartes argued that only humans are conscious, and not other animals]]

The [[mind–body problem]] in philosophy examines the relationship between [[mind]] and matter, and in particular the relationship between [[consciousness]] and the brain. A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] or [[Monism|monist]]. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. Monism maintains that there is only one kind of stuff, and that mind and matter are both aspects of it. The problem was addressed by pre-[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophers,&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=RC Olby |editor2=GN Cantor |editor3=JR Christie |editor4=MJS Hodges |title= Companion to the History of Modern Science |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year= 1996 |pages= 702–11 |isbn=978-0415145787 |chapter=The mind-body problem |chapter-url=http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap102h.html |author= Robert M.

Descartes believed that humans only, and not other animals have this non-physical mind.

The rejection of the mind–body dichotomy is found in French [[Structuralism]], and is a position that generally characterized post-war [[French philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book |title=The Body and Society: Explorations in Social Theory |author=Bryan S.

The absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non-physical mind and its physical extension has proven problematic to dualism and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book

=== Epiphenomenalism ===

[[Epiphenomenalism]] is the theory in [[philosophy of mind]] that mental phenomena are caused by physical processes in the brain or that both are effects of a common cause, as opposed to mental phenomena driving the physical mechanics of the brain. The impression that thoughts, feelings, or sensations cause physical effects, is therefore to be understood as illusory to some extent. For example, it is not the feeling of fear that produces an increase in heart beat, both are symptomatic of a common physiological origin, possibly in response to a legitimate external threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/epipheno/| title=Epiphenomenalism| author=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy| accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of epiphenomenalism goes back to the post-Cartesian attempt to solve the riddle of [[Cartesian dualism]], i.e., of how mind and body could interact. [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie|La Mettrie]], [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] all in their own way began this way of thinking. The idea that even if the animal were conscious nothing would be added to the production of behavior, even in animals of the human type, was first voiced by La Mettrie (1745), and then by [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis|Cabanis]] (1802), and was further explicated by [[Hodgson]] (1870) and [[T.H. Huxley|Huxley]] (1874).&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, T. H. (1874). "On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History", ''The Fortnightly Review'', n.s.16:555-580. Reprinted in ''Method and Results: Essays by Thomas H. Huxley'' (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1898)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, S. 2006. "Where's the action?: Epiphenomenalism and the problem of free will". In W. Banks, S. Pockett, and S. Gallagher. ''Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? An Investigation of the Nature of Intuition'' (109-124). Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley (1874) likened mental phenomena to the whistle on a steam locomotive. However, epiphenomenalism flourished primarily as it found a niche among methodological or scientific behaviorism. In the early 1900s [[behaviorism|scientific behaviorists]] such as [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[John B. Watson]], and [[B. F. Skinner]] began the attempt to uncover laws describing the relationship between stimuli and responses, without reference to inner mental phenomena. Instead of adopting a form of [[eliminative materialism|eliminativism]] or mental [[fictionalism]], positions that deny that inner mental phenomena exist, a behaviorist was able to adopt epiphenomenalism in order to allow for the existence of mind. However, by the 1960s, scientific behaviourism met substantial difficulties and eventually gave way to the [[cognitive revolution]]. Participants in that revolution, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], reject epiphenomenalism and insist upon the efficacy of the mind. Fodor even speaks of "epiphobia"—fear that one is becoming an epiphenomenalist.

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]] defends in an essay titled ''On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History'' an epiphenomenalist theory of consciousness according to which consciousness is a causally inert effect of neural activity—"as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=T.

=== Animal ethics ===

[[Bernard Rollin]] of Colorado State University, the principal author of two U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals, writes that researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain, and veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain.&lt;ref name=Rollin117&gt;Rollin, Bernard. ''The Unheeded Cry: Animal Consciousness, Animal Pain, and Science''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp. xii, 117-118, cited in Carbone 2004, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians, Rollin was regularly asked to prove animals are conscious and provide scientifically acceptable grounds for claiming they feel pain.&lt;ref name=Rollin117/&gt; Academic reviews of the topic are equivocal, noting that the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Griffin | first1 = DR | authorlink = Donald Griffin | last2 = Speck | first2 = GB | year = 2004 | title = New evidence of animal consciousness | url = http://postcog.ucd.ie/files/fulltext.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Animal Cognition | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–18 | doi = 10.1007/s10071-003-0203-x | pmid = 14658059 | access-date = 29 November 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130121030113/http://postcog.ucd.ie/files/fulltext.pdf | archive-date = 21 January 2013 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but some critics continue to question how reliably animal mental states can be determined.&lt;ref name=nuffield45&gt;[http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/fileLibrary/pdf/RIA_Report_FINAL-opt.pdf The Ethics of research involving animals] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625033250/http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/fileLibrary/pdf/RIA_Report_FINAL-opt.pdf |date=25 June 2008 }} Nuffield Council on Bioethics, Accessed 27 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | first1 = C | year = 1998 | title = Assessing animal cognition: ethological and philosophical perspectives | url = https://www.animalsciencepublications.org/publications/jas/pdfs/76/1/42 | format = PDF | journal = J.

In 1976 [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote, "The evolution of the capacity to simulate seems to have culminated in subjective consciousness. Why this should have happened is, to me, the most profound mystery facing modern biology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], [[The Selfish Gene]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, eight neuroscientists felt it was still too soon for a definition. They wrote an apology in "Human Brain Function":&lt;ref&gt;''Human Brain Function'', by Richard Frackowiak and 7 other neuroscientists, page 269 in chapter 16 "The Neural Correlates of Consciousness" (consisting of 32 pages), published 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
::"We have no idea how consciousness emerges from the physical activity of the brain and we do not know whether consciousness can emerge from non-biological systems, such as computers... At this point the reader will expect to find a careful and precise definition of consciousness. You will be disappointed. Consciousness has not yet become a scientific term that can be defined in this way. Currently we all use the term ''consciousness'' in many different and often ambiguous ways. Precise definitions of different aspects of consciousness will emerge ... but to make precise definitions at this stage is premature."

[[Consciousness]] is sometimes defined as the quality or state of being aware of an external object or something within oneself.&lt;ref name="van_Gulick2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=consciousness|publisher=Merriam-Webster|location=|accessdate=4 June 2012|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined somewhat vaguely as: [[subjectivity]], [[awareness]], [[sentience]], the ability to [[experience]] or to [[feeling|feel]], wakefulness, having a sense of [[self]]hood, and the executive control system of the mind.&lt;ref name="Farthing1992Psychology"/&gt; Despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers believe that there is a broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is.&lt;ref name="John Searle 2005"/&gt; [[Max Velmans]] and Susan Schneider wrote in ''The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness'': "Anything that we are aware of at a given moment forms part of our consciousness, making conscious experience at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Susan Schneider |author2=Max Velmans |author2-link=Max Velmans |last-author-amp=yes |year=2008 |chapter=Introduction |editor=Max Velmans |editor2=Susan Schneider |title=The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-75145-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related terms, also often used in vague or ambiguous ways, are:
* [[Awareness]]: the state or ability to perceive, to feel, or to be [[conscious]] of events, [[Object (philosophy)|objects]], or sensory [[pattern]]s. In this level of consciousness, sense data can be confirmed by an observer without necessarily implying [[understanding]]. More broadly, it is the state or quality of being aware of something. In [[biological psychology]], awareness is defined as a human's or an animal's [[perception]] and [[cognitive]] reaction to a condition or event.
* [[Self-awareness]]: the capacity for [[introspection]] and the ability to reconcile oneself as an individual separate from the environment and other individuals.
* [[Self-consciousness]]: an [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] sense of self-awareness. It is a preoccupation with oneself, as opposed to the philosophical state of [[self-awareness]], which is the awareness that one exists as an individual being; although some writers use both terms interchangeably or synonymously.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Lipka/Thomas M. Brinthaupt ''Self-perspectives Across the Life Span'', p. 228, SUNY Press, 1992 {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1003-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sentience]]: the ability to be aware ([[feeling|feel]], [[perception|perceive]], or be [[consciousness|conscious]]) of one's surroundings or to have subjective experiences. Sentience is a minimalistic way of defining consciousness, which is otherwise commonly used to collectively describe sentience plus other characteristics of the mind.
* [[Sapience]]: often defined as wisdom, or the ability of an organism or entity to act with appropriate [[Value judgment|judgment]], a mental faculty which is a component of [[Intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] or alternatively may be considered an additional faculty, apart from intelligence, with its own properties.
* [[Qualia]]: individual instances of [[Subjectivity|subjective]], [[consciousness|conscious experience]].

Sentience (the ability to feel, perceive, or to experience subjectivity) is not the same as self-awareness (being aware of oneself as an individual). The [[mirror test]] is sometimes considered to be an operational test for self-awareness, and the handful of animals that have passed it are often considered to be self-aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Gallup Jr GG | author2=Anderson JR | author3= Shillito DJ | year=2002 | url=http://colinallen.dnsalias.org/Secure/TCA/gallup-final.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006070539/http://colinallen.dnsalias.org/Secure/TCA/gallup-final.pdf | archivedate=6 October 2014 | chapter=The mirror test | editor1= Bekoff M | editor2= Allen C | editor3= Burghardt GM  | title=The cognitive animal: Empirical and Theoretical perspectives on animal cognition | pages=325–333 | publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haikonen POA (2007) [http://www.consciousness.it/CAI/online_papers/Haikonen.pdf "Reflections of consciousness: The mirror test"] Proceedings of the 2007 AAAI Fall ''Symposium on Consciousness'', pp. 67–71.&lt;/ref&gt; It remains debatable whether recognition of one's mirror image can be properly construed to imply full self-awareness,&lt;ref name="self-recognition"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Asendorpf | first1 = J.

==Scientific approaches==
Since [[Descartes]]'s proposal of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], it became a general consensus that the mind had become a matter of [[philosophy]] and that science was not able to penetrate the issue of consciousness - that consciousness was outside of space and time. However, over the last 20 years, many scholars have begun to move toward a science of consciousness. [[Antonio Damasio]] and [[Gerald Edelman]] are two neuroscientists who have led the move to neural correlates of the self and of consciousness.

[[Eugene Linden (author)|Eugene Linden]], author of ''The Parrot's Lament'' suggests there are many examples of animal behavior and intelligence that surpass what people would suppose to be the boundary of animal consciousness. Linden contends that in many of these documented examples, a variety of animal species exhibit behavior that can only be attributed to emotion, and to a level of consciousness that we would normally ascribe only to our own species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher = G.K.

Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] counters that:
{{quote|Consciousness requires a certain kind of informational organization that does not seem to be 'hard-wired' in humans, but is instilled by human culture. Moreover, consciousness is not a black-or-white, all-or-nothing type of phenomenon, as is often assumed. The differences between humans and other species are so great that speculations about animal consciousness seem ungrounded. Many authors simply assume that an animal like a bat has a point of view, but there seems to be little interest in exploring the details involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/dennett_anim_csness.html Animal consciousness: what matters and why] Daniel Dennett&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Consciousness in mammals (including humans) is an aspect of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as [[subjectivity]], [[sentience]], and the ability to [[perception|perceive]] the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. It is a subject of much research in [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive science]]. Some philosophers divide consciousness into [[phenomena]]l consciousness, which is subjective experience itself, and access consciousness, which refers to the global availability of information to processing systems in the brain.&lt;ref name=Block1995&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Block | first1 = Ned | authorlink = Ned Block | year = 1995 | title = On a confusion about a function of consciousness | url = http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/1995_Function.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 227–287 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00038188| citeseerx = 10.1.1.207.6880 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phenomenal consciousness has many different experienced qualities, often referred to as [[qualia]]. Phenomenal consciousness is usually consciousness ''of'' something or ''about'' something, a property known as [[intentionality]] in philosophy of mind.&lt;ref name=Block1995 /&gt;

In humans, there are three common methods of studying consciousness, i.e. verbal report, behavioural demonstrations, and neural correlation with conscious activity.

{{main|Mirror test}}

The sense in which animals (or human infants) can be said to have [[consciousness]] or a [[self-concept]] has been hotly debated; it is often referred to as the debate over animal minds. The best known research technique in this area is the [[mirror test]] devised by [[Gordon G. Gallup]], in which the skin of an animal (or human infant) is marked, while it is asleep or sedated, with a mark that cannot be seen directly but is visible in a mirror. The animal is then allowed to see its reflection in a mirror; if the animal spontaneously directs grooming behaviour towards the mark, that is taken as an indication that it is aware of itself.&lt;ref&gt;Bischof-Köhler, D.

Until recently it was thought that self-recognition was absent from animals without a [[neocortex]], and was restricted to mammals with large brains and well developed social cognition. However, in 2008 a study of self-recognition in [[corvids]] reported significant results for magpies. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common [[ancestor]] nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror and mark tests showed that neocortex-less [[magpies]] are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond in the mirror and mark test in a manner similar to apes, dolphins and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of self-recognition, is at least a prerequisite of self-recognition. This is not only of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence; it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness.&lt;ref name="Magpie"/&gt; However even in the chimpanzee, the species most studied and with the most convincing findings, clear-cut evidence of self-recognition is not obtained in all individuals tested. Occurrence is about 75% in young adults and considerably less in young and old individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Povinelli | first1 = DJ | last2 = Rulf | first2 = AB | last3 = Landau | first3 = KR | last4 = Bierschwale | first4 = DT | year = 1993 | title = Self-recognition in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): distribution, ontogeny, and patterns of emergence | url = | journal = J Comp Psychol | volume = 107 | issue = 4 | pages = 347–372 | doi=10.1037/0735-7036.107.4.347 | pmid=8112048}}&lt;/ref&gt; For monkeys, non-primate mammals, and in a number of bird species, exploration of the mirror and social displays were observed.

The mirror test has attracted controversy among some researchers because it is entirely focused on vision, the primary sense in humans, while other species rely more heavily on other senses such as the [[olfactory]] sense in dogs.&lt;ref name=Lea&gt;Lea SEG (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=GDijCnSs57gC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=%22mirror+test%22+vision+sense++olfactory+&amp;ots=W-mYx41b6e&amp;sig=hu03Tbm0GbgDXl-FwrYiDHPiQM0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mirror%20test%22&amp;f=false ''Concept learning in nonprimate mammals: In search of evidence''] In D Mareschal, PC Quinn and SEG Lea, ''The Making of Human Concepts'', pp. 173–199.

Another approach to determine whether a non-human animal is conscious derives from passive speech research with a macaw (see [[Talking Birds#Arielle|Arielle]]). Some researchers propose that by passively listening to an animal's voluntary speech, it is possible to learn about the thoughts of another creature and to determine that the speaker is conscious. This type of research was originally used to investigate a child's [[crib talk|crib speech]] by Weir (1962) and in investigations of early speech in children by Greenfield and others (1976).

[[Zipf's law]] might be able to be used to indicate if a given dataset of animal communication indicate an intelligent natural language. Some researchers have used this algorithm to study bottlenose dolphin language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~xanadu/papers/suzuki05.pdf|title=The use of Zipf's law in animal communication analysis|last1=Suzuki|first1=Ryuji|last2=Buck|first2=John|last3=Tyack|first3=Peter|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=69|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.08.004|date=January 2005|pages=F9–F17|citeseerx=10.1.1.112.5869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pain or suffering===
{{see also|Pain in animals}}

Further arguments revolve around the ability of animals to feel [[pain]] or [[suffering]]. Suffering implies consciousness. If animals can be shown to suffer in a way similar or identical to humans, many of the arguments against human suffering could then, presumably, be extended to animals. Others have argued that pain can be demonstrated by adverse reactions to negative stimuli that are non-purposeful or even maladaptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carter | first1 = Alan | year = 2005 | title = Animals, Pain and Morality | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Philosophy | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 17–22 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-5930.2005.00289.x | pmid = 15948329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such reaction is [[transmarginal inhibition]], a phenomenon observed in humans and some animals akin to [[mental breakdown]].

[[Carl Sagan]], the American cosmologist, points to reasons why humans have had a tendency to deny animals can suffer:
{{quote|Humans – who enslave, castrate, experiment on, and fillet other animals – have had an understandable penchant for pretending animals do not feel pain. A sharp distinction between humans and 'animals' is essential if we are to bend them to our will, make them work for us, wear them, eat them – without any disquieting tinges of guilt or regret. It is unseemly of us, who often behave so unfeelingly toward other animals, to contend that only humans can suffer. The behavior of other animals renders such pretensions specious. They are just too much like us.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Sagan|Sagan, Carl]] and [[Ann Druyan]] (1993) ''Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors'', Ballantine Books. {{ISBN|9780345384720}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Webster, a professor of animal husbandry at Bristol, argues:
{{quote|People have assumed that intelligence is linked to the ability to suffer and that because animals have smaller brains they suffer less than humans. That is a pathetic piece of logic, sentient animals have the capacity to experience pleasure and are motivated to seek it, you only have to watch how cows and lambs both seek and enjoy pleasure when they lie with their heads raised to the sun on a perfect English summer's day. Just like humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1502933,00.html The secret life of moody cows] John Webster&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, there is no agreement where the line between organisms that can feel pain and those that cannot should be drawn. [[Justin Leiber]], a philosophy professor at [[Oxford University]] writes that:
{{quote|[[Montaigne]] is ecumenical in this respect, claiming consciousness for spiders and ants, and even writing of our duties to trees and plants. [[Peter Singer|Singer]] and [[Samuel Clarke|Clarke]] agree in denying consciousness to sponges. Singer locates the distinction somewhere between the shrimp and the oyster. He, with rather considerable convenience for one who is thundering hard accusations at others, slides by the case of insects and spiders and bacteria, they pace Montaigne, apparently and rather conveniently do not feel pain. The intrepid [[Midgley]], on the other hand, seems willing to speculate about the subjective experience of tapeworms ...[[Thomas Nagel|Nagel]] ... appears to draw the line at flounders and wasps, though more recently he speaks of the inner life of cockroaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leiber | first1 = Justin | date = December 1988 | title = Cartesian Linguistics? | journal = [[Philosophia (journal)|Philosophia]] | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 309–46 | doi=10.1007/BF02380646}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are also some who reject the argument entirely, arguing that although suffering animals feel anguish, a suffering plant also struggles to stay alive (albeit in a less visible way). In fact, no living organism 'wants' to die for another organism's sustenance. In an article written for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Carol Kaesuk Yoon argues that:

{{quote|When a plant is wounded, its body immediately kicks into protection mode. It releases a bouquet of volatile chemicals, which in some cases have been shown to induce neighboring plants to pre-emptively step up their own chemical defenses and in other cases to lure in predators of the beasts that may be causing the damage to the plants. Inside the plant, repair systems are engaged and defenses are mounted, the molecular details of which scientists are still working out, but which involve signaling molecules coursing through the body to rally the cellular troops, even the enlisting of the genome itself, which begins churning out defense-related proteins ... If you think about it, though, why would we expect any organism to lie down and die for our dinner? Organisms have evolved to do everything in their power to avoid being extinguished. How long would any lineage be likely to last if its members effectively didn't care if you killed them? &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/science/15food.html?pagewanted=all No Face, but Plants Like Life Too] Carol Kaesuk Yoon, ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The neuroscientist [[Joseph LeDoux]] advocates avoiding terms derived from human subjective experience when discussing brain functions in animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = LeDoux | first1 = J | year = 2012 | title = Rethinking the emotional brain | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627312001298 | journal = Neuron | volume = 73 | issue = 4| pages = 653–676 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.02.004 | pmid = 22365542 | pmc = 3625946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the common practice of calling brain circuits that detect and respond to threats "fear circuits" implies that these circuits are responsible for feelings of fear. LeDoux argues that Pavlovian fear conditioning should be renamed Pavlovian threat conditioning to avoid the implication that "fear" is being acquired in rats or humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = LeDoux | first1 = JE | year = 2014 | title = Coming to terms with fear | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/111/8/2871.full | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 111 | issue = 8| pages = 2871–2878 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1400335111 | pmid = 24501122 | bibcode = 2014PNAS..111.2871L | pmc = 3939902 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Key to his theoretical change is the notion of survival functions mediated by survival circuits, the purpose of which is to keep organisms alive rather than to make emotions. For example, defensive survival circuits exist to detect and respond to threats. While all organisms can do this, only organisms that can be conscious of their own brain’s activities can feel fear. Fear is a conscious experience and occurs the same way as any other kind of conscious experience: via cortical circuits that allow attention to certain forms of brain activity. LeDoux argues the only differences between an emotional and non-emotion state of consciousness are the underlying neural ingredients that contribute to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = LeDoux | first1 = JE | year = 2015 | title = Feelings: What are they &amp; how does the brain make them? | url = http://www.cns.nyu.edu/home/LeDoux/pdf/daed_LeDoux_2015.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Daedalus | volume = 144 | issue = 1| pages = 96–111 | doi = 10.1162/DAED_a_00319 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LeDoux JE (2015) [https://books.google.com/books?id=mg0bBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22Anxious:+Using+the+Brain+to+Understand+and+Treat+Fear+and+Anxiety%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMIiZ7s26KZxwIVZnumCh09Zwvy ''Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety''], Penguin Publishing Group. {{ISBN|9781101619940}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience===
[[File:PurkinjeCell.jpg|right|thumb|Drawing by [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] (1899) of [[neuron]]s in the pigeon cerebellum]]

[[Neuroscience]] is the scientific study of the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neuroscience|work=Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a highly active [[interdisciplinary]] science that collaborates with many other fields. The scope of neuroscience has broadened recently to include [[molecular biology|molecular]], [[cellular neuroscience|cellular]], [[neural development|developmental]], [[neuroanatomy|structural]], [[neurophysiology|functional]], [[evolutionary neuroscience|evolutionary]], [[computational neuroscience|computational]], and [[neurological disorders|medical]] aspects of the nervous system. Theoretical studies of [[neural network]]s are being complemented with techniques for [[brain mapping|imaging]] sensory and motor tasks in the [[brain]].
According to a 2008 paper, neuroscience explanations of psychological phenomena currently have a "seductive allure", and "seem to generate more public interest" than explanations which do not contain neuroscientific information.&lt;ref name=Weisberg2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = DS | last2 = Keil | first2 = FC | last3 = Goodstein | first3 = J | last4 = Rawson | first4 = E | last5 = Gray | first5 = JR | year = 2008 | title = The seductive allure of neuroscience explanations | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 470–477 | doi = 10.1162/jocn.2008.20040 | pmc=2778755 | pmid=18004955}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that subjects who were not neuroscience experts "judged that explanations with logically irrelevant neuroscience information were more satisfying than explanations without.&lt;ref name=Weisberg2008 /&gt;

====Neural correlates====
{{see also|Neural correlates of consciousness}}

The [[neural correlates of consciousness]] constitute the minimal set of neuronal events and mechanisms sufficient for a specific conscious [[Perception#Process and terminology|percept]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroscientists use empirical approaches to discover [[neural correlate]]s of subjective phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~koch/glossary.html here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313192029/http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~koch/glossary.html |date=13 March 2013 }} for a glossary of related terms.&lt;/ref&gt; The set should be ''minimal'' because, if the brain is sufficient to give rise to any given conscious experience, the question is which of its components is necessary to produce it.

Visual sense and representation was reviewed in 1998 by [[Francis Crick]] and [[Christof Koch]]. They concluded [[sensory neuroscience]] can be used as a bottom-up approach to studying consciousness, and suggested experiments to test various hypotheses in this research stream.&lt;ref name="Crick 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Crick| first1=F.| last2=Koch| first2=C.| title=Consciousness and neuroscience| journal=Cereb Cortex| volume=8 | issue=2 | pages=97–107 |date=1998 | doi= 10.1093/cercor/8.2.97| pmid=9542889 }} [http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/2/97.long Full text].&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature that distinguishes humans from most animals is that we are not born with an extensive repertoire of behavioral programs that would enable us to survive on our own ("[[physiological prematurity]]"). To compensate for this, we have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration. Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated to the extent that their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness. Take, as an example, the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road. Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control. In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beilock2002|Beilock et al. 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools depends on the simultaneous development of appropriate behavioural assays and model organisms amenable to large-scale genomic analysis and manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;Adamantidis A.R., Zhang F., Aravanis A.M., Deisseroth K. and de Lecea L. (2007) "Neural substrates of awakening probed with optogenetic control of hypocretin neurons". ''Nature''.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of such fine-grained neuronal analysis in animals with ever more sensitive psychophysical and brain imaging techniques in humans, complemented by the development of a robust theoretical predictive framework, will hopefully lead to a rational understanding of consciousness.

====Neocortex====
[[File:Taeniopygia guttata -Karratha, Pilbara, Western Australia, Australia -male-8 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Previously researchers had thought that patterns of neural sleep exhibited by [[zebra finch]]es needed a mammalian [[neocortex]]&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt;]]

The [[neocortex]] is a part of the brain of mammals. It consists of the [[grey matter]], or neuronal cell bodies and [[myelin|unmyelinated]] fibers, surrounding the deeper [[white matter]] ([[myelin]]ated [[axon]]s) in the [[cerebrum]]. The neocortex is smooth in [[rodent]]s and other small mammals, whereas in [[primate]]s and other larger mammals it has deep grooves and wrinkles. These folds increase the surface area of the neocortex considerably without taking up too much more volume. Also, neurons within the same wrinkle have more opportunity for connectivity, while neurons in different wrinkles have less opportunity for connectivity, leading to compartmentalization of the cortex. The neocortex is divided into [[frontal lobe|frontal]], [[parietal lobe|parietal]], [[occipital lobe|occipital]], and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] lobes, which perform different functions. For example, the occipital lobe contains the [[primary visual cortex]], and the temporal lobe contains the [[primary auditory cortex]]. Further subdivisions or areas of neocortex are responsible for more specific cognitive processes. The neocortex is the newest part of the [[cerebral cortex]] to evolve (hence the prefix "neo"); the other parts of the cerebral cortex are the [[paleocortex]] and [[archicortex]], collectively known as the [[allocortex]]. In humans, 90% of the cerebral cortex is neocortex.

Researchers have argued that consciousness arises in the neocortex, and therefore cannot arise in animals which lack a neocortex. For example, Rose argued in 2002 that the "fishes have nervous systems that mediate effective escape and avoidance responses to noxious stimuli, but, these responses must occur without a concurrent, human-like awareness of pain, suffering or distress, which depend on separately evolved neocortex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose |first1=James D |year=2002 |title=The neurobehavioral nature of fishes and the question of awareness and pain |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/Fishwelfare/Rose.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Reviews in Fisheries Science |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=1–38 |doi=10.1080/20026491051668 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010181101/http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/Fishwelfare/Rose.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2012 |df=dmy|citeseerx=10.1.1.598.8119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently that view has been challenged, and many researchers now believe that animal consciousness can arise from [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] [[subcortical]] brain networks.&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt;

====Attention====
[[Attention]] is the [[cognitive process]] of selectively concentrating on one aspect of the environment while ignoring other things. Attention has also been referred to as the allocation of processing resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=John R. |authorlink=John Robert Anderson (psychologist) |year=2004 |title=Cognitive psychology and its implications |edition=6th |publisher=Worth Publishers |url= https://books.google.com/?id=9P4p6eAULMoC |isbn=978-0-7167-0110-1 |page=519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attention also has variations amongst cultures. Voluntary attention develops in specific cultural and institutional contexts through engagement in cultural activities with more competent community members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chavajay|first=Pablo|author2=Barbara Rogoff|title=Cultural variation in management of attention by children and their caregivers|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1999|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1079–1090|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.35.4.1079|pmid=10442876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most experiments show that one [[neural correlate]] of attention is enhanced firing. If a neuron has a certain response to a stimulus when the animal is not attending to the stimulus, then when the animal does attend to the stimulus, the neuron's response will be enhanced even if the physical characteristics of the stimulus remain the same. In many cases attention produces changes in the [[EEG]]. Many animals, including humans, produce [[gamma wave]]s (40–60&amp;nbsp;Hz) when focusing attention on a particular object or activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaiser J, Lutzenberger W |title=Induced gamma-band activity and human brain function |journal=Neuroscientist |volume=9 |pages=475–84 |year=2003 |pmid=14678580 |doi=10.1177/1073858403259137 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Extended consciousness====
[[Extended consciousness]] is an animal's autobiographical self-perception. It is thought to arise in the brains of animals which have a substantial capacity for memory and reason. It does not necessarily require language. The perception of a historic and future self arises from a stream of information from the immediate environment and from neural structures related to memory. The concept was popularised by [[Antonio Damasio]] and is used in [[biological psychology]]. Extended consciousness is said to arise in structures in the [[human brain]] described as ''image spaces'' and ''dispositional spaces''. Image spaces imply areas where [[senses|sensory]] impressions of all types are processed, including the focused awareness of the [[core consciousness]]. Dispositional spaces include convergence zones, which are networks in the brain where memories are processed and recalled, and where knowledge is merged with immediate experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativitycountry.net.au/creativity/consciousness.htm 'Layers' or 'levels' of consciousness?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410002602/http://creativitycountry.net.au/creativity/consciousness.htm |date=10 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,32273,00.html Time Magazine 1999 'Mystery Of Consciousness']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Metacognition====

Metacognition: knowing about knowing. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It can take many forms; it includes knowledge about when and how to use particular strategies for learning or for problem solving.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe" /&gt; It has been suggested that metacognition in some animals provides evidence for cognitive self-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1037/a0020129 |last = Couchman |first = Justin J. |author2=Coutinho, M.

Such neurons have been directly observed in [[primate]] and other species including [[birds]]. The function of the mirror system is a subject of much speculation. Many researchers in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology consider that this system provides the physiological mechanism for the perception action coupling (see the [[common coding theory]]).&lt;ref name="EmpathicBrain"/&gt; They argue that mirror neurons may be important for understanding the actions of other people, and for learning new skills by imitation.

''Evolutionary Analysis.'' 2007. Pearson Education, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Opinions are divided as to where in biological [[evolution]] consciousness emerged and about whether or not consciousness has survival value. It has been argued that consciousness emerged (i) exclusively with the first humans, (ii) exclusively with the first mammals, (iii) independently in mammals and birds, or (iv) with the first reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Århem |author2=B.

Baars]].&lt;ref&gt;Baars, Bernard J. ''A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness.'' 1993. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]] suggested that humans evolved consciousness in order to make themselves the subjects of thought.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 5"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J.

The concept of consciousness can refer to voluntary action, awareness, or wakefulness. However, even voluntary behaviour involves unconscious mechanisms. Many cognitive processes take place in the cognitive unconscious, unavailable to conscious awareness. Some behaviours are conscious when learned but then become unconscious, seemingly automatic. Learning, especially implicitly learning a skill, can take place outside of consciousness. For example, plenty of people know how to turn right when they ride a bike, but very few can accurately explain how they actually do so.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 5"/&gt;

''Consciousness and Cognition'', '''14''' (1): 140–168. {{doi|10.1016/j.concog.2004.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edelman distinguishes between what he calls primary and secondary consciousness:

* [[Primary consciousness]]: is the ability, found in humans and some animals, to integrate observed events with memory to create an [[awareness]] of the present and immediate past of the world around them. This form of consciousness is also sometimes called "sensory consciousness". Put another way, primary consciousness is the presence of various [[subjectivity|subjective]] sensory contents of consciousness such as [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s, [[perception]]s, and mental images. For example, primary consciousness includes a person's experience of the blueness of the ocean, a bird's song, and the feeling of pain. Thus, primary consciousness refers to being mentally aware of things in the world in the present without any sense of past and future; it is composed of mental images bound to a time around the measurable present.&lt;ref name = Edelmansky&gt;Edelman, G. (2004). ''Wider than the sky: The phenomenal gift of consciousness'': Yale Univ Pr.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Secondary consciousness]]: is an individual's accessibility to their history and plans. The concept is also loosely and commonly associated with having awareness of one's own [[consciousness]]. The ability allows its possessors to go beyond the limits of the remembered present of [[primary consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Edelman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edelman | first1 = G. M. | year = 2003 | title = Naturalizing consciousness: a theoretical framework | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 100 | issue = 9| pages = 5520–5524 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0931349100| pmid = 12702758 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.5520E | pmc = 154377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary consciousness can be defined as simple awareness that includes [[perception]] and [[emotion]]. As such, it is ascribed to most animals. By contrast, secondary consciousness depends on and includes such features as self-reflective awareness, [[abstract thinking]], [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] and [[metacognition]].&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, G. M. (1992). Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On the Matter of the Mind. Basic Books, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edelman's theory focuses on two [[nervous system]] organizations: the [[brainstem]] and [[limbic system]]s on one side and the [[thalamus]] and [[cerebral cortex]] on the other side. The brain stem and limbic system take care of essential body functioning and survival, while the thalamocortical system receives signals from sensory receptors and sends out signals to voluntary muscles such as those of the arms and legs. The theory asserts that the connection of these two systems during evolution helped animals learn [[adaptive behavior]]s.&lt;ref name = Edelmansky/&gt;

Other scientists have argued against Edelman's theory, instead suggesting that primary consciousness might have emerged with the basic vegetative systems of the brain. That is, the evolutionary origin might have come from sensations and primal emotions arising from [[sensory neuron|sensors]] and [[sensory receptors|receptors]], both internal and surface, signaling that the well-being of the creature was immediately threatened—for example, hunger for air, thirst, hunger, pain, and extreme temperature change. This is based on neurological data showing the [[thalamus|thalamic]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal]], [[orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal]], [[insular cortex|insula]], and [[midbrain]] sites are the key to consciousness of thirst.&lt;ref name = Merker&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Merker | first1 = B | year = 2007 | title = Consciousness without a cerebral cortex: A challenge for neuroscience and medicine | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 63–81 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x07000891| pmid = 17475053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These scientists also point out that the cortex might not be as important to primary consciousness as some neuroscientists have believed.&lt;ref name = Merker/&gt; Evidence of this lies in the fact that studies show that systematically disabling parts of the cortex in animals does not remove consciousness. Another study found that children born without a cortex are conscious. Instead of cortical mechanisms, these scientists emphasize brainstem mechanisms as essential to consciousness.&lt;ref name = Merker/&gt; Still, these scientists concede that higher order consciousness does involve the cortex and complex communication between different areas of the brain.

While animals with [[primary consciousness]] have long-term memory, they lack explicit narrative, and, at best, can only deal with the immediate scene in the remembered present. While they still have an advantage over animals lacking such ability, evolution has brought forth a growing complexity in consciousness, particularly in mammals. Animals with this complexity are said to have secondary consciousness.
Secondary consciousness is seen in animals with [[semantic]] capabilities, such as the four [[great apes]]. It is present in its richest form in the human species, which is unique in possessing complex [[language]] made up of [[syntax]] and semantics. In considering how the neural mechanisms underlying primary consciousness arose and were maintained during evolution, it is proposed that at some time around the divergence of [[reptiles]] into mammals and then into [[birds]], the [[embryological]] development of large numbers of new reciprocal connections allowed rich [[Reentry (neural circuitry)|re-entrant]] activity to take place between the more posterior brain systems carrying out perceptual categorization and the more frontally located systems responsible for value-category memory.&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt; The ability of an animal to relate a present complex scene to its own previous history of learning conferred an adaptive evolutionary advantage. At much later evolutionary epochs, further re-entrant circuits appeared that linked semantic and linguistic performance to categorical and conceptual [[memory]] systems. This development enabled the emergence of secondary consciousness.&lt;ref name="Sky"&gt;Edelman, G. M. (2004). Wider than the sky: a revolutionary view of consciousness. Penguin Press Science, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, G. M. (200). Second Nature:Brain Science and Human Knowledge. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ursula Voss of the [[Universität Bonn]] believes that the theory of [[protoconsciousness]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobson |first1=J. A. |year=2009 |title=REM sleep and dreaming: towards a theory of protoconsciousness |url=http://194.80.240.74/images/events/REM%20Sleep%20and%20Dreaming.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=803–862 |doi=10.1038/nrn2716 |pmid=19794431 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; may serve as adequate explanation for self-recognition found in birds, as they would develop secondary consciousness during REM sleep.&lt;ref name="Voss"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Voss | first1 = Ursula | year = 2010 | title = Changes in EEG pre and post awakening | volume = 93 | issue = | pages = 23–56 | doi = 10.1016/S0074-7742(10)93002-X | pmid = 20970000 | series = International Review of Neurobiology | isbn = 9780123813244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She added that many types of birds have very sophisticated language systems. Don Kuiken of the University of Alberta finds such research interesting as well as if we continue to study consciousness with animal models (with differing types of consciousness), we would be able to separate the different forms of reflectiveness found in today's world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuiken | first1 = Don | year = 2010 | title = Primary and secondary consciousness during dreaming | url = http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/IJoDR/article/download/594/pdf_17 | journal = International Journal of Dream Research | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 21–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the advocates of the idea of a secondary consciousness, [[self-recognition]] serves as a critical component and a key defining measure. What is most interesting then, is the evolutionary appeal that arises with the concept of self-recognition. In non-human species and in children, the [[mirror test]] (see above) has been used as an indicator of [[self-awareness]].

|title = ''Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness''
|quote = The absence of a [[neocortex]] does not appear to preclude an organism from experiencing affective states. Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit [[Intention|intentional behaviors]]. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the [[neurological substrate]]s that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Philip ''et al.'' (2012) [http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness] Publicly proclaimed in Cambridge, UK, on July 7, 2012, at the Francis Crick Memorial Conference on Consciousness in Human and non-Human Animals.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a group of neuroscientists attending a conference on "Consciousness in Human and non-Human Animals" at the [[University of Cambridge]] in the UK, signed ''The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness'' (see box on the right).&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131109230457/http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness (Archive)] 7 July 2012. Written by Philip Low and edited by Jaak Panksepp, Diana Reiss, David Edelman, Bruno Van Swinderen, Philip Low and Christof Koch. University of Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fcmconference.org/ "Consciousness in Human and non-Human Animals"] Francis Crick Memorial Conference, 7 July 2012, Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the accompanying text they "unequivocally" asserted:&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt;

:* "The field of Consciousness research is rapidly evolving. Abundant new techniques and strategies for human and non-human animal research have been developed. Consequently, more data is becoming readily available, and this calls for a periodic reevaluation of previously held preconceptions in this field. Studies of non-human animals have shown that [[homology (biology)|homologous]] brain circuits correlated with conscious experience and perception can be selectively facilitated and disrupted to assess whether they are in fact necessary for those experiences. Moreover, in humans, new non-invasive techniques are readily available to survey the [[Neural correlates of consciousness|correlates of consciousness]]."&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt;

:* "The [[neural substrate]]s of emotions do not appear to be confined to cortical structures. In fact, [[subcortical]] neural networks aroused during affective states in humans are also critically important for generating emotional behaviors in animals. Artificial arousal of the same brain regions generates corresponding behavior and feeling states in both humans and non-human animals. Wherever in the brain one evokes instinctual emotional behaviors in non-human animals, many of the ensuing behaviors are consistent with experienced feeling states, including those internal states that are rewarding and punishing. Deep brain stimulation of these systems in humans can also generate similar affective states. Systems associated with affect are concentrated in subcortical regions where neural [[Homology (biology)|homologies]] abound. Young human and non-human animals without neocortices retain these brain-mind functions. Furthermore, [[neural circuit]]s supporting behavioral/electrophysiological states of attentiveness, sleep and decision making appear to have arisen in evolution as early as the invertebrate radiation, being evident in insects and cephalopod mollusks (e.g., octopus)."&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt;

:* "Birds appear to offer, in their behavior, neurophysiology, and neuroanatomy a striking case of [[parallel evolution]] of consciousness. Evidence of near human-like levels of consciousness has been most dramatically observed in [[grey parrot]]s. Mammalian and avian emotional networks and cognitive microcircuitries appear to be far more homologous than previously thought. Moreover, certain species of birds have been found to exhibit neural [[sleep pattern]]s similar to those of mammals, including REM sleep and, as was demonstrated in [[zebra finch]]es, neurophysiological patterns previously thought to require a mammalian neocortex. [[Magpie]]s in particular have been shown to exhibit striking similarities to humans, great apes, dolphins, and elephants in studies of [[Mirror test|mirror self-recognition]]."&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt;

:* "In humans, the effect of certain [[hallucinogen]]s appears to be associated with a disruption in cortical [[Feedforward, Behavioral and Cognitive Science|feedforward]] and feedback processing. Pharmacological interventions in non-human animals with compounds known to affect conscious behavior in humans can lead to similar perturbations in behavior in non-human animals. In humans, there is evidence to suggest that awareness is correlated with cortical activity, which does not exclude possible contributions by subcortical or early cortical processing, as in visual awareness. Evidence that human and non-human animal emotional feelings arise from homologous subcortical brain networks provide compelling evidence for evolutionarily shared primal affective qualia."&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt;

Dogs were previously listed as non-self-aware animals. Traditionally, self-consciousness was evaluated via the [[mirror test]].

====Grey Parrots====
Research with captive [[grey parrot]]s, especially [[Irene Pepperberg]]'s work with an individual named [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]], has demonstrated they possess the ability to associate simple human words with meanings, and to intelligently apply the abstract concepts of shape, colour, number, zero-sense, etc. According to Pepperberg and other scientists, they perform many cognitive tasks at the level of dolphins, chimpanzees, and even human [[toddlers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uA9szbR7p_wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Alex+Studies:+Cognitive+and+Communicative+Abilities+of+Grey+Parrots#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Alex Studies: cognitive and communicative abilities of grey parrots|last=PEPPERBERG|first=Irene M.|last2=Pepperberg|first2=Irene M.|date=2009-06-30|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674041998|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable African grey is [[N'kisi]], which in 2004 was said to have a vocabulary of over 950 words which she used in creative ways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sheldrake.org/nkisi/nkisi1_text.html Nkisi Audio Text 1]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when [[Jane Goodall]] visited N'kisi in his New York home, he greeted her with "Got a chimp?" because he had seen pictures of her with chimpanzees in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projo.com/ri/hopkinton/content/JANE_GOODALL08_05-08-08_RJA2H78_v81.37330d1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629042353/http://www.projo.com/ri/hopkinton/content/JANE_GOODALL08_05-08-08_RJA2H78_v81.37330d1.html |title=Jane Goodall attends opening of bird sanctuary |date=8 May 2008 |author=Maria Armental |archive-date=29 June 2011 |website=www.projo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, research led by Dalila Bovet of [[Paris West University Nanterre La Défense]], demonstrated grey parrots were able to coordinate and collaborate with each other to an extent. They were able to solve problems such as two birds having to pull strings at the same time to obtain food. In another example, one bird stood on a perch to release a food-laden tray, while the other pulled the tray out from the test apparatus. Both would then feed. The birds were observed waiting for their partners to perform the necessary actions so their behaviour could be synchronized. The parrots appeared to express individual preferences as to which of the other test birds they would work with.&lt;ref name=gill&gt;{{cite web |last=Gill |first=Victoria |title=Parrots choose to work together |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/12913981 |publisher=BBC Nature News |accessdate=19 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520092257/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/12913981| archivedate=20 May 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corvids====
[[File:Magpie in Madrid (Spain) 87b.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Eurasian magpie]] passes the [[mirror test]]]]
It was recently thought that self-recognition was restricted to mammals with large brains and highly evolved social cognition, but absent from animals without a [[neocortex]]. However, in 2008, an investigation of self-recognition in [[corvids]] was conducted revealing the ability of self-recognition in the magpie. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common [[ancestor]] nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror test showed that although [[magpies]] do not have a neocortex, they are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond in the mirror test in a manner similar to apes, dolphins, killer whales, pigs and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of self-recognition, is at least a prerequisite of self-recognition. This is not only of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence, it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness.&lt;ref name="Magpie"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1733">The '''Antaryāmin''', in terms of [[Hindu]] philosophy, is related to the "inner-self", the "inner-controller" or the "inner-guidance" that exists in a person and itself manifests on an intuitive way to the one manifesting it. It recalls a teacher or a guru that resides within and once it is manifested - for a higher context of knowledge guidance - usually after one [[Conjuration|summons]] or [[Prayer|prays]] for it, the Antaryamin comes to help. In some cases, the Antaryamin is asked to be manifested in order to resolve non-intellectual issues, also performing [[miracle]]s to the one asking.

==Hindu contextualization==

On the [[Hindu scriptures]], we find the concept of the Antaryamin as the Inner Controller &lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanian&lt;/ref&gt; after the building of the elementary concepts regarding a [[deity]] or an [[Ego (spirituality)|ego]] - on a [[wikt:unity|unity]] way - of which is controlling, somehow to a compared intelligence, the universe and all that is. This [[intelligence]] may also refer to what is called [[consciousness]] or [[awareness]] that is far superior, hence capable of doing superior things.&lt;ref&gt;[[Swami Krishnananda]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Austin Hobart Clark''' (December 17, 1880 &amp;ndash; October 28, 1954) was an [[United States|American]] [[zoology|zoologist]]. He was born in  [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]] and died in [[Washington, D.C.]] His research covered a wide range of topics including [[oceanography]], [[marine biology]], [[ornithology]], and [[entomology]].

==Biography==

The son of Theodore Minot Clark and Jeannette French Clark, Clark obtained his Bachelor of Arts at [[Harvard University]] in 1903. He had five children with his first wife Mary Wendell Upham, whom he married on March 6, 1906. Mary died in December 1931 and Clark was remarried in 1933 to [[Leila F. Clark|Leila Gay Forbes]].

In 1901, Clark organized a scientific expedition to [[Isla Margarita]] in [[Venezuela]]. From 1903 to 1905, he conducted research in the [[Antilles]]. From 1906 to 1907, he led a scientific team aboard the 1882 [[USS Albatross (1882)|USS ''Albatross'']]. In 1908, he took a post at the [[National Museum of Natural History]], which he held until his retirement in 1950.

Clark had important and various roles in a number of [[learned society|learned societies]]: to name a few, he was president of the Entomological Society of Washington, vice president of the [[American Geophysical Union]], and directed the press service of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].

Clark was author to more than 600 publications written in English, French, Italian, German, and Russian. Some of the most well-known include ''Animals of Land and Sea'' (1925), ''Nature Narratives'' (two volumes, 1929 and 1931), ''The New Evolution'' (1930), and ''Animals Alive'' (1948).

Several animal species and genera were first scientifically described by Clark, including the [[Lesser Antillean macaw]] (1905), the [[Martinique parrot]] (1905), the [[Dominican green-and-yellow macaw]] (1908), the [[mulga parrot]] (1910), the [[crustacean]] genus ''[[Laomenes]]'' (1919) or the [[starfish]] species ''[[Copidaster lymani]]'' (1948).
[[File:Diagram from Zoogenesis.png|thumb|"Three sumultaneous paths of development from the primitive single cell", ''Zoogenesis'']]

==Zoogenesis==

Clark is best known for his evolutionary theory called zoogenesis, which he introduced in his book ''The New Evolution: Zoogenesis'' (1930).&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;J. H. W. (1931). ''Reviewed Work: The New Evolution Zoogenesis by Austin H. Clark''. ''Science Progress in the Twentieth Century (1919-1933)'' 26 (101): 160.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory challenged the [[Tree of life (biology)|single tree view]] of [[evolution]], according to Clark the major types of life forms on earth evolved separately and independently from all the others.&lt;ref name="Numbers 2006"&gt;Numbers, Ronald L. (2006). ''[[The Creationists|The Creationists: From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design]]''. Harvard University Press. p. 53. {{ISBN|0-674-02339-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Clark wrote that "the seemingly simultaneous appearance of all the phyla or major groups of animals simply means that life at its very first beginnings developed at once and simultaneously from the primitive single cell in every possible direction, giving rise to some original form or forms in every phylum." He termed this process, ''eogenesis''.&lt;ref name="Science"/&gt;

Clark was [[Quoting out of context|quote-mined]] by creationists but he rejected any supernatural view of origins.&lt;ref name="Numbers 2006"/&gt;

'''Business Process Model and Notation''' ('''BPMN''') is a [[Information visualization|graphical representation]] for specifying [[business process]]es in a [[business process modeling|business process model]].

[[Business Process Management Initiative]] (BPMI) developed BPMN, which has been maintained by the [[Object Management Group]] since the two organizations merged in 2005. Version 2.0 of BPMN was released in January 2011,&lt;ref name="BPMN20" /&gt; at which point the name was adapted to '''Business Process Model ''and'' Notation''' as execution semantics were also introduced alongside the notational and diagramming elements. Though it is an OMG specification, BPMN is also ratified as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 19510.

==Overview==
Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard for [[business process modeling]] that provides a graphical notation for specifying [[business process]]es in a ''Business Process Diagram'' (BPD),&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050202022_2005202152.pdf ''An XML Representation for Crew Procedures''], Richard C. Simpson (2004), Final Report NASA Faculty Fellowship Program (Johnson Space Center)&lt;/ref&gt; based on a [[flowchart]]ing technique very similar to [[activity diagram]]s from [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpmn.org/Documents/Notations_and_Workflow_Patterns.pdf ''Process Modeling Notations and Workflow Patterns''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706013817/http://www.bpmn.org/Documents/Notations_and_Workflow_Patterns.pdf |date=July 6, 2010 }}, paper by Stephen A. White of IBM Corporation (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of BPMN is to support [[business process management]], for both technical users and business users, by providing a notation that is intuitive to business users, yet able to represent complex process semantics. The BPMN specification also provides a mapping between the graphics of the notation and the underlying constructs of execution languages, particularly [[Business Process Execution Language]] (BPEL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen A. White|title=Business Process Modeling Notation v1.0|url=http://www.omg.org/bpmn/Documents/BPMN_V1-0_May_3_2004.pdf|date=3 May 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818123649/http://www.omg.org/bpmn/Documents/BPMN_V1-0_May_3_2004.pdf|archivedate=18 August 2013|df=}} for the Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI)&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary goal of BPMN is to provide a standard notation readily understandable by all business stakeholders. These include the business analysts who create and refine the processes, the technical developers responsible for implementing them, and the business managers who monitor and manage them. Consequently, BPMN serves as a common language, bridging the communication gap that frequently occurs between [[business process design]] and implementation.

Currently there are several competing standards for [[business process modeling]] languages used by modeling tools and processes. Widespread adoption of a single standard would help unify the expression of basic business process concepts (e.g., public and private processes, choreographies), as well as advanced process concepts (e.g., exception handling, transaction compensation).

Since 2014, BPMN has been complemented by a new standard for building [[decision model]]s, the [[Decision Model and Notation]] standard.

==Topics==

===Scope===
BPMN is constrained to support only the concepts of modeling applicable to business processes. Other types of modeling done by organizations for non-process purposes are out of scope for BPMN. Examples of modeling excluded from BPMN are:
* Organizational structures
* Functional breakdowns
* Data models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=OMG|title=BPMN Working Draft|url=http://www.omg.org/bpmn/Documents/BPMN_Sections_1_and%202CMP.pdf|accessdate=2012-05-01}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, while BPMN shows the flow of data (messages), and the association of data artifacts to activities, it is not a [[data flow diagram]].

===Elements===
BPMN models consist of simple diagrams constructed from a limited set of graphical elements. For both business users and developers, they simplify understanding of business activities' flow and process.
BPMN's four basic element categories are:

; Flow objects
: Events, activities, gateways
; Connecting objects
: Sequence flow, message flow, association
; [[Swim lane]]s
: Pool, lane
; Artifacts
: Data object, group, annotation

These four categories enable creation of simple business process diagrams (BPDs). BPDs also permit making new types of flow object or artifact, to make the diagram more understandable.

===Flow objects and connecting objects===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

''Flow objects'' are the main describing elements within BPMN, and consist of three core elements: events, activities, and gateways.

; Event
: An Event is represented with a circle and denotes something that ''happens'' (compared with an activity, which is something that is ''done''). Icons within the circle denote the type of event (e.g., an envelope representing a message, or a clock representing time). Events are also classified as '''Catching''' (for example, if catching an incoming message starts a process) or '''Throwing''' (such as throwing a completion message when a process ends).
:; Start event
:: Acts as a process trigger; indicated by a single narrow border, and can only be ''Catch'', so is shown with an open (outline) icon.
:; Intermediate event
:: Represents something that happens between the start and end events; is indicated by a double border, and can ''Throw'' or ''Catch'' (using solid or open icons as appropriate). For example, a task could flow to an event that throws a message across to another pool, where a subsequent event waits to catch the response before continuing.
:; End event
:: Represents the result of a process; indicated by a single thick or bold border, and can only ''Throw'', so is shown with a solid icon.

; Activity
: An activity is represented with a rounded-corner rectangle and describes the kind of work which must be done. An activity is a generic term for work that a company performs.  It can be atomic or compound.
:; Task
:: A task represents a single unit of work that is not or cannot be broken down to a further level of business process detail.  It is referred to as an atomic activity.  A task is the lowest level activity illustrated on a process diagram.  A set of tasks may represent a high-level procedure.
:; Sub-process
:: Used to hide or reveal additional levels of business process detail. When collapsed, a sub-process is indicated by a plus sign against the bottom line of the rectangle; when expanded, the rounded rectangle expands to show all flow objects, connecting objects, and artifacts.  A sub-process is referred to as a compound activity.
:: Has its own self-contained start and end events; sequence flows from the ''parent'' process must not cross the boundary.
:; Transaction
:: A form of sub-process in which all contained activities must be treated as a whole; i.e., they must all be completed to meet an objective, and if any one of them fails, they must all be compensated (undone). Transactions are differentiated from expanded sub-processes by being surrounded by a double border.
:; Call Activity
::  A point in the process where a global process or a global Task is reused. A call activity is differentiated from other activity types by a bolded border around the activity area.

; Gateway
: A gateway is represented with a diamond shape and determines forking and merging of paths, depending on the conditions expressed.
:; Exclusive
::  Used to create alternative flows in a process. Because only one of the paths can be taken, it is called exclusive.
:; Event Based
::  The condition determining the path of a process is based on an evaluated event.
:; Parallel
::  Used to create parallel paths without evaluating any conditions.
:; Inclusive
::  Used to create alternative flows where all paths are evaluated.
:; Exclusive Event Based
::  An event is being evaluated to determine which of mutually exclusive paths will be taken.
:; Complex
::  Used to model complex synchronization behavior.
:; Parallel Event Based
::  Two parallel processes are started based on an event, but there is no evaluation of the event.

; Connections
''Flow objects'' are connected to each other using '''Connecting objects''', which are of three types: sequences, messages, and associations.

:; Sequence Flow
: A Sequence Flow is represented with a solid line and arrowhead, and shows in which order the activities are performed. The ''sequence flow'' may also have a symbol at its start, a small diamond indicates one of a number of '''conditional flows''' from an activity, while a diagonal slash indicates the '''default flow''' from a decision or activity with conditional flows.

:; Message Flow
: A Message Flow is represented with a dashed line, an open circle at the start, and an open arrowhead at the end. It tells us what messages flow across organizational boundaries (i.e., between pools). A message flow can never be used to connect activities or events within the same pool.

:; Association
: An Association is represented with a dotted line. It is used to associate an Artifact or text to a Flow Object, and can indicate some directionality using an open arrowhead (toward the artifact to represent a result, from the artifact to represent an input, and both to indicate it is read and updated). No directionality is used when the Artifact or text is associated with a sequence or message flow (as that flow already shows the direction).

===Swim lanes and artifacts===
&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;

File:Data object - BPMN 2.0 Artifacts.png|Data objects
File:Group - BPMN 2.0 Artifacts.png|Groups
File:Annotation - BPMN 2.0 Artifacts.png|Annotation
&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Swim lane]]s are a visual mechanism of organising and categorising activities, based on [[cross functional flowchart]]ing, and in BPMN consist of two types:

; Pool
: Represents major participants in a process, typically separating different organisations. A pool contains one or more lanes (like a real swimming pool). A pool can be open (i.e., showing internal detail) when it is depicted as a large rectangle showing one or more lanes, or collapsed (i.e., hiding internal detail) when it is depicted as an empty rectangle stretching the width or height of the diagram.

;Lane
: Used to organise and categorise activities within a pool according to function or role, and depicted as a rectangle stretching the width or height of the pool. A lane contains the flow objects, connecting objects and artifacts.

'''Artifacts''' allow developers to bring some more information into the model/diagram. In this way the model/diagram becomes more readable. There are three pre-defined Artifacts and they are:
* Data objects: Data objects show the reader which data is required or produced in an activity.
* Group: A Group is represented with a rounded-corner rectangle and dashed lines. The group is used to group different activities but does not affect the flow in the diagram.
* Annotation: An annotation is used to give the reader of the model/diagram an understandable impression.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===BPMN 2.0===
The vision of BPMN 2.0 is to have one single specification for a new Business Process Model and Notation that defines the notation, metamodel and interchange format but with a modified name that still preserves the "BPMN" brand. The features include
* Aligning BPMN with the business process definition meta model [[BPDM]] to form a single consistent language.
* Enabling the exchange of business process models and their diagram layouts among process modeling tools to preserve semantic integrity.
* Expand BPMN to allow model orchestrations and choreographies as stand-alone or integrated models.
* Support the display and interchange of different perspectives on a model that allow a user to focus on specific concerns.
* Serialize BPMN and provide XML schemes for model transformation and to extend BPMN towards business modeling and executive decision support.

The current version of the specification was released in January, 2011.&lt;ref name="BPMN20"&gt;{{cite web|author=OMG|title=BPMN 2.0|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/|accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The new specification introduces a categorization of event triggers into "catching" and "throwing" events. I.e. there are two kinds of intermediate message events now – one kind responsible for reception of messages ("catching") and one kind responsible for sending messages ("throwing").
*In addition to the old types, it introduces a new type, the '''signal event'''.
*Start and end link events do not exist any longer in BPMN 1.1.
*The old "rule events" were renamed to '''conditional events'''. The semantics and appearance have not changed.
*The event-based gateway in BPMN 1.1 looks slightly different from what it looked like in 1.0. Instead of the hexagonal star it now has a pentagon in its center. The same shape is also used for the multiple events (start, intermediate, end).
*There is an additional line separating your lane's description from its content.

==Types of BPMN sub-model==
Business process modeling is used to communicate a wide variety of information to a wide variety of audiences. BPMN is designed to cover this wide range of usage and allows modeling of end-to-end business processes to allow the viewer of the Diagram to be able to easily differentiate between sections of a BPMN Diagram. There are three basic types of sub-models within an end-to-end BPMN model: Private (internal) business processes, Abstract (public) processes, and Collaboration (global) processes:

;Private (internal) business processes: Private business processes are those internal to a specific organization and are the type of processes that have been generally called workflow or BPM processes. If swim lanes are used then a private business process will be contained within a single Pool. The Sequence Flow of the Process is therefore contained within the Pool and cannot cross the boundaries of the Pool. Message Flow can cross the Pool boundary to show the [[interactions]] that exist between separate private business processes.

;Abstract (public) processes: This represents the interactions between a private business process and another process or participant. Only those activities that communicate outside the private business process are included in the abstract process. All other “internal” activities of the private business process are not shown in the abstract process. Thus, the abstract process shows to the outside world the sequence of messages that are required to interact with that business process. Abstract processes are contained within a Pool and can be modeled separately or within a larger BPMN Diagram to show the Message Flow between the abstract process activities and other entities. If the abstract process is in the same Diagram as its corresponding private business process, then the activities that are common to both processes can be associated.

;Collaboration (global) processes: A collaboration process depicts the interactions between two or more business entities. These interactions are defined as a sequence of activities that represent the message exchange patterns between the entities involved. Collaboration processes may be contained within a Pool and the different participant business interactions are shown as Lanes within the Pool. In this situation, each Lane would represent two participants and a direction of travel between them. They may also be shown as two or more Abstract Processes interacting through Message Flow (as described in the previous section). These processes can be modeled separately or within a larger BPMN Diagram to show the Associations between the collaboration process activities and other entities. If the collaboration process is in the same Diagram as one of its corresponding private business process, then the activities that are common to both processes can be associated.

Within and between these three BPMN sub-models, many types of Diagrams can be created. The following are the types of business processes that can be modeled with BPMN (those with asterisks may not map to an executable language):
* High-level private process activities (not functional breakdown)*
* Detailed private business process
* As-is or old business process*
* To-be or new business process
* Detailed private business process with interactions to one or more external entities (or “Black Box” processes)
* Two or more detailed private business processes interacting
* Detailed private business process relationship to Abstract Process
* Detailed private business process relationship to Collaboration Process
* Two or more Abstract Processes*
* Abstract Process relationship to Collaboration Process*
* Collaboration Process only (e.g., ebXML BPSS or RosettaNet)*
* Two or more detailed private business processes interacting through their Abstract Processes and/or a Collaboration Process

BPMN is designed to allow all the above types of Diagrams. However, it should be cautioned that if too many types of sub-models are combined, such as three or more private processes with message flow between each of them, then the Diagram may become too hard for someone to understand. Thus, we{{Who|date=October 2015}} recommend that the modeler pick a focused purpose for the BPD, such as a private process, or a collaboration process.

==Weaknesses==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
The weaknesses of BPMN could relate to:
* ambiguity and confusion in sharing BPMN models
* support for routine work
* support for knowledge work, and
* converting BPMN models to executable environments
* support for [[business rules]] and decision-making

&lt;!-- The following section should be compressed first and properly referenced.
Weaknesses related to ambiguity and confusion in sharing BPMN models:
* Lane and pool constructs are overloaded
* The informality of the language leaves it open for dialects in vendor applications to be introduced
* There are no rules for layout of models which may result in notation dialects
* It is possible to model the same process with different notation variations
* Light-weight model readers might disregard constructs used from the extended set and miss out on actual model behavior
* It is very hard to communicate BPMN models based on the BPD alone

Weaknesses related to support for routine work:
* There is no support to represent the state of objects
* There is little support for the modeling of system structure
* Advanced process modeling require the use of construct attributes that do not have graphical representation
* Little support for resource modeling
* No support for business specific terms

Weaknesses related to support for knowledge work:
* No support for goals and responsibilities that you commit to by accepting a Role in a process
* No support for conditions that, once true, mean you have met the Role's goals
* No support for policies and regulations that you must adhere to when playing a Role
* No support for personal characteristics required to play a Role, such as skills, experience and personality type
* No support for creation of another Role of a particular type – for instance, adding another designer to a team
* No support for purposeful, long-lived communication channels (not just hand-offs or function calls)
* No support for discussions or other forms of information exchange in which more than 2 people are involved
* No support for actions that you can carry out at any time during the life of a Role, repeatedly if necessary, according to a combination of organizational policies and/or personal judgement
* No support for separate streams of activity in a single Role
* No support for documents and data both private to a Role and shared with other Roles

Weaknesses related to converting BPMN models to executable environments:
* Converting BPMN models to executable process environments are not direct
* BPMN cannot be directly semantically validated which makes it possible to build semantically wrong models
* There is no clear indication in the specification when a process model is considered to be ”completed” in situations where there are multiple end-events
* The specification indicates that each start-event should generate a process instance which causes problems for processes with multiple start events without wait
* There are unaddressed issues in the specification regarding the interrupt caused by sub-processes experiencing exceptions in a parallel multi-instance activity
* There is a lack of support for instance-specific data for tasks
* There is no standardised file format to exchange BPMN models between different tools

Weaknesses related to business rules and decision-making
* The business rules task assumed a single set of rules, a single decision table, could represent a decision-making activity
* Many BPMN diagrams use gateways to describe decision-making rather than to describe how to act on a decision that has already been made
* BPMN contains no artifacts suitable for a [[decision model]]--&gt;

=== BPEL and BPMN ===

The BPMN specification includes an informal and partial [https://web.archive.org/web/20100706013908/http://www.bpmn.org/Documents/Mapping_BPMN_to_BPEL_Example.pdf mapping] from BPMN to BPEL 1.1. A more detailed mapping of BPMN to [[Business Process Execution Language|BPEL]] has been implemented in a number of tools, including an open-source tool known as [https://code.google.com/p/bpmn2bpel/ BPMN2BPEL]. However, the development of these tools has exposed fundamental differences between BPMN and BPEL, which make it very difficult, and in some cases impossible, to generate [[human-readable]] BPEL code from BPMN models. Even more difficult is the problem of BPMN-to-BPEL ''round-trip'' engineering: generating BPEL code from BPMN diagrams and maintaining the original BPMN model and the generated BPEL code synchronized, in the sense that any modification to one is propagated to the other.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

It later came to light that Brandt had shot his parents &amp;ndash; his pregnant mother fatally &amp;ndash; in 1971, when he was 13; he spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released, and was never criminally charged. Because of this incident, and because of Brandt's efficiency in killing his wife and niece and his hidden obsession with [[human anatomy]], investigators looked into the prospect that he had committed other murders since moving to Florida in 1973. Police have positively ascribed up to six homicides to Brandt.

== Early life ==
Brandt was the second child and only son of Herbert and Ilse Brandt, two [[German people|German]] immigrants who originally lived in [[Connecticut]]. His father worked as a laborer for a division of [[International Harvester]], eventually working his way up to draftsman and project engineer. However, the family frequently moved, and as a result, Brandt and his older sister Angela attended several different schools. He was regarded as a good student, but was shy and had difficulty adjusting to new surroundings. In September 1968, Herbert was transferred to International Harvester's plant in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]]. Every summer and Christmas, the family would vacation in [[Florida]], where Brandt went on hunting trips with his father.

== 1971 incident ==
On the night of January 3, 1971, Brandt, then 13, walked into his parents' bathroom while Herbert was shaving and Ilse, who was eight months pregnant, was taking a bath. Brandt shot both parents at point blank range; his father survived, but his mother died at the scene. Brandt then confronted his sister Angela, but his gun wouldn't fire. After a physical struggle, Angela managed to calm her brother down before she fled the house and sought help from neighbors. Brandt also left the house and knocked on the door of a girl next door named Sandi Radcliffe, telling her, "Sandi, I just shot my mom and dad." Herbert Brandt later identified his son as his attacker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18559_162-1655084.html?pageNum=3 Deadly Obsession] Page 3, CBS News, 25 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Because he was too young to be charged with murder under Indiana law, Brandt appeared before a [[grand jury]] and was ordered to undergo three separate [[psychiatric evaluation]]s, all of which couldn't determine what motivated him to shoot his parents. One of Brandt's psychiatrists, Ronald Pancner, later recounted, "Basically, I was looking for [[mental illness]]. And he wasn't showing the signs and symptoms of serious mental illness, which I thought was what the court wanted to know." Interviews with Brandt's family and friends showed that he had no conflicts at home or at school, and had previously shown nothing but devotion to his mother. Brandt spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released back into the custody of his family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18559_162-1655084.html?pageNum=4 Deadly Obsession] Page 4, CBS News, 25 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; They never spoke of the incident again, and Brandt's younger sisters were never told about the shooting.

== 2004 incident ==
Shortly after Brandt's release, his family relocated to Florida. One year later, Brandt's father and sisters moved away after he remarried, while Brandt himself remained in Florida under the care of his grandparents. In 1984, Brandt got a degree on electronics and became a radar specialist. In 1986, he married his girlfriend Teri. No relatives were invited to their wedding. The couple settled in a beach house of [[Big Pine Key]], the southernmost portion of the [[Florida Keys]], in 1989. 

On September 2, 2004, Brandt and Teri evacuated from their home ahead of [[Hurricane Ivan]]. Their niece, Michelle Lynn Jones, invited them to stay at her residence in near [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. Throughout the visit, Jones kept in regular contact with her mother, Mary Lou, as well as several friends. On the evening of September 13, one of Jones' friends, Lisa Emmons, was scheduled to visit her house. However, Jones discouraged her from coming after reporting that the Brandts had an argument after drinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18559_162-1655084.html?pageNum=2 Deadly Obsession] Page 2, CBS News, 25 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; After that night, Jones stopped answering telephone calls, which alarmed her acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlj-foundation.org/history.html History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021051320/http://mlj-foundation.org/history.html# |date=2013-10-21 }}, Michelle Lynn Jones Foundation. Retrieved 2 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, another one of Jones' friends, Debbie Knight, came to her house to check on her while on the phone with Jones' mother. After finding the front door locked, Knight tried to enter the house through the garage, where she found Brandt's [[human decomposition|decomposing]] body hanging from the rafters. Knight contacted the police, who entered the house and found the bodies of Brandt's wife and niece. Teri had been stabbed seven times in the chest while reclining on a couch. Jones had been [[decapitation|decapitated]] and [[disembowelment|disemboweled]], with her [[human heart|heart]] and [[human organs|organs]] removed. Jones' head was also placed next to her own body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsvn.com/features/articles/investigations/MI20479/ 7 News Investigations: Killer Connection] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109150114/http://www.wsvn.com/features/articles/investigations/MI20479/ |date=January 9, 2011 }}, WSVN-TV, 15 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The weapons used in the crimes had been knives from Jones' kitchen.

== Investigation ==
A search of Brandt's residence on Big Pine Key revealed that he was a monthly subscriber to [[Victoria's Secret]] [[Trade literature|catalog]]s; had an extensive collection of surgery-themed books, posters, and clippings; and regularly searched online for autopsy photos and [[snuff film]] websites depicting violence against women. Because Brandt's murder of Jones indicated methodology and past experience, and because he traveled often due to his job, police checked [[cold case]]s in Florida that matched his apparent ''[[modus operandi]]'', and launched requests for similar inquiries in the United States and abroad. Ultimately, the search linked Brandt to twenty-six unsolved murders in Florida dating back to 1973.

* '''Carol Sullivan, 1978:''' Sullivan, aged 12, was abducted from a school bus stop in [[Volusia County]] on September 20, 1978. Her skull was found inside a bucket, leading authorities to presume she was murdered and decapitated. Brandt was 20 years old and lived in Volusia County at the time, but could not be tied to the crime in any other way. 
* '''Lisa Saunders, 1988:''' Saunders, aged 20, was beaten, stabbed, and dragged from her car in Big Pine Key in December 1988. Her heart was missing when she was found, but it is unclear if it was extracted by an attacker or eaten by vultures. 
* '''Sherry Perisho, 1989:''' Perisho's partially-clothed body was found on July 16, 1989, near the North Pine Channel Bridge at Big Pine Key, where Perisho, who was homeless, lived on a [[dinghy]]. Her throat had been slashed and her head had been nearly severed; like Jones, her body was extensively mutilated and her heart was removed. Perisho was found less than 1,000 feet from where Brandt lived, and Brandt matched a [[composite sketch]] of a man seen crossing [[U.S. Route 1]] near where Perisho was discovered on the night she was murdered. Based on this evidence, [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]] investigators determined that Brandt killed Perisho and officially closed the case on May 6, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-05-06/news/MBRANDT06_1_brandt-monroe-county-seminole Killer tied to '89 death -- wife suspected him all along], ''The Orlando Sentinel'', 6 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Darlene Toler, 1995:''' Toler was a [[prostitute]] from [[Miami]] whose body, missing her head and heart, was found near a highway wrapped in plastic. Brandt used the same highway regularly and he kept a mileage record of his travels, which shows an entry for 100 miles {{ndash}} the driving distance between Big Pine Key and Miami {{ndash}} on the day of her murder.

'''claro fair trade''', commonly shortened to '''''claro''''' and written in [[Lower case|minuscules]], is a [[sustainability]]-oriented retail company based in [[Orpund]], Biel/Bienne administrative district, in the Swiss [[Canton of Bern]]. claro was initiated by [[Erklärung von Bern]], a sustainability-oriented independent solidarity development in Switzerland in 1977.&lt;ref name="woz-evb-20090122"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.woz.ch/0904/erklaerung-von-bern/erfinderinnen-des-fairen-handels|title=Erklärung von Bern: Erfinderinnen des fairen Handels|publisher=[[WOZ Die Wochenzeitung]] 04/2009|author=Susan Boos|language=German|date=2009-01-22|accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and orientation ==
{{main|Erklärung von Bern}}
The history of fair trade in Switzerland is closely linked to the rise of the solidarity movement in Switzerland in the 1970s, and the political development organizations such as the [[Erklärung von Bern]] (EvB) consumer actions. At that time, products such as coffee, bananas and jute were symbols of the growing support for displaying developmental contexts. At the same time consumers demanded more engagement for development aid without supporting the charity mentality. The success of these actions occurred to the establishment of a joint Swiss import central named ''OS3'' that was pioneering fair trade, and specialized in the sale of food and crafts from developing trading partners, i.e. small producers from economic marginal areas, an alternative approach to the world trade.&lt;ref name="sozialarchiv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findmittel.ch/Archive/archNeu/Arclaro.html|title=claro fair trade AG|publisher=Schweizerisches Sozialarchiv: Archivfindmittel|author=|language=German|date=2014-04-17|accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides ''OS3'', in 1977 EvB initiated the organisation ''Suisse Tiers Monde'' which became the first two claro fair trade labels; they resulted in the collaboration with ''Corr-the jute works'' situated in Bangladesh. In the following years the product line was expanded gradually, among them cane sugar from the Philippines and other agriculture products from the so-called third world countries, for example coffee from Tanzania, and tea from Sri Lanka, and the cooperative ''El Ceibo'' in Bolivia around 1985,&lt;ref name="hds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D47101.php|title=Erklärung von Bern (EvB)|publisher=HDS|author=Andrea Weibel|language=German|date=2004-10-29|accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as today the popular ''claro'' shops in Switzerland,&lt;ref name="zsz-20120426"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zsz.ch/artikel_54490.html |title=Fair-Trade-Läden müssen sich auf den Markt ausrichten |publisher=[[Zürichsee-Zeitung]] |author=Bettina Bernet-Hug and Silvia Luckner (photo) |language=German |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2015-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119044427/http://www.zsz.ch/artikel_54490.html |archivedate=2015-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; among other sustainable initiatives financially supported by the [[Alternative Bank Schweiz]] ABS.

In 1997 the ''claro fair trade'' cooperative was transformed into an [[Aktiengesellschaft]] according to the Swiss law. claro fair trade claims as ultimate goals the continuous improvement of the social, economic and environmental situation of their producers. These include the minimization of middlemen in favor of direct cooperation with local partners and supporting social projects. Whenever possible the products are certified by the Max Havelaar Foundation.&lt;ref name="sozialarchiv"/&gt;

== Weltladen and claro shops ==
''claro'' contributes its products in the so-called ''claro'' and associated ''Weltladen'' shops.&lt;ref name="claro-überuns"/&gt; As other sustainable corporations, there was a decrease in turnover the past fiscal years, mainly caused to reduced export of the products outside Switzerland.&lt;ref name="claro-jahresbericht-2014"/&gt;

The distributor claimed as of 2014, to support by its import activities more than 260 small producer groups and craft shops, and thus improved the living conditions of more than 100,000 people from the [[southern hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="claro-jahresbericht-2014"/&gt;

'''Computational sustainability''' is a broad field that attempts to optimize societal, economic, and environmental resources using methods from [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computational-sustainability.org/|title=www.computational-sustainability.org|website=www.computational-sustainability.org|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sustainability]] in this context is the ability to produce enough energy for the world to support its biological systems.  Using the power of computers to process large quantities of information, decision making algorithms allocate resources based on real-time information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Unknown|url=http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1570000/1562174/p23-frenkel.pdf?ip=73.234.206.61&amp;id=1562174&amp;acc=OPEN&amp;key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%252E4D4702B0C3E38B35%252E4D4702B0C3E38B35%252E6D218144511F3437&amp;CFID=594460368&amp;CFTOKEN=33596010&amp;__acm__=1458873213_60e5758f5509c54d6c6abc8c305ffbc8|doi=10.1145/1570000/1562174/p23-frenkel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications are widespread. [[Smart grid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s implement renewable resources and storage capabilities to control the production and expenditure of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.compsust.net/|title=CompSustNet: Home|website=www.compsust.net|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intelligent transportation system]] analyze road conditions and relay information to drivers so they can make smarter decisions based on real time traffic information.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerrero-ibanez|first=J. A.|last2=Zeadally|first2=S.|last3=Contreras-Castillo|first3=J.|date=2015-12-01|title=Integration challenges of intelligent transportation systems with connected vehicle, cloud computing, and internet of things technologies|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7368833|journal=IEEE Wireless Communications|volume=22|issue=6|pages=122–128|doi=10.1109/MWC.2015.7368833|issn=1536-1284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) seek to improve safety and travel times while minimizing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions for all travelers, though focusing mainly on drivers. ITS has two systems: one for data collection/relaying, and another for data processing. [[Data collection]] can be achieved with video cameras over busy areas, sensors that detect various pieces from location of certain vehicles to infrastructure that's breaking down, and even drivers who notice an accident and use a [[mobile app]], like [[Waze]], to report its whereabouts.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-44160-2_5|title=Transportation Systems: Monitoring, Control, and Security|last=Timotheou|first=Stelios|last2=Panayiotou|first2=Christos G.|last3=Polycarpou|first3=Marios M.|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783662441596|editor-last=Kyriakides|editor-first=Elias|series=Studies in Computational Intelligence|pages=125–166|language=en|editor-last2=Polycarpou|editor-first2=Marios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS) aim to make public transportation more efficient and convenient for its riders.  Electronic payment methods allow users to add money to their [[smart card]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s at stations and online.  APTS relay information to transit facilities about current vehicle locations to give riders expected wait times on screens at stations and directly to customers' smart phones.  Advanced Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) collect information using cameras and other sensors that gather information regarding how congested roads are.  [[Ramp meter]]s regulate the number of cars entering highways to limit backups.  Traffic signals use algorithms to optimize travel times depending on the number of cars on the road.  Electronic highway signs relay information regarding travel times, detours, and accidents that may affect drivers ability to reach their destination.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

With the rise of consumer connectivity, less infrastructure is needed for these ITS to make informed decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/shift-to-constant-connectivity.html|title=The Shift to Constant Connectivity|website=Think with Google|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Google Maps]] uses smartphone crowdsourcing to get information about real-time traffic conditions allowing motorists to make decisions based on toll roads, travel times, and overall distance traveled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncta.com/platform/broadband-internet/how-google-tracks-traffic/|title=How Google Tracks Traffic|website=www.ncta.com|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cars communicate with their manufacturers to remotely install software updates when new features are added or bugs are being patched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/wireless-updates-to-core-automotive-functions-could-spell-privacy-troubles/|title=Your next car will update itself while you sleep, and maybe watch you too|website=Digital Trends|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tesla Motors]] even uses these updates to increase their cars efficiency and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11378880/Tesla-software-update-did-your-car-just-get-faster.html|title=Tesla software update: did your car just get faster?|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These connections give ITS a means to accurately collect information and even relay that information to drivers with no other infrastructure needed.

Future ITS systems will aid in car communication with not just the infrastructure, but with other cars as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Utilities ==
The [[electrical grid]] was designed to send consumers electricity from [[Electric generator|electricity generators]] for a monthly fee based on usage. Homeowners are installing [[solar panel]]s and large batteries to store the power created by these panels.  A [[smart grid]] is being created to accommodate the new energy sources.  Rather than just electricity being sent to a household to be consumed by the various appliances in the home, electricity can flow in either direction.  Additional sensors along the grid will improve information collection and decreased downtime during power outages. These sensors can also relay information directly to consumers about how much energy they're using and what the costs will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/publications/catalyst/fa14-solar-power-on-the-rise.html#.VwbE4hMrKu4|title=Solar Power on the Rise|website=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contrafreeloading''' is an observed [[behavior]] in which an organism, when offered a choice between provided food or food that requires effort to obtain, prefers the food that requires effort.

The term was coined in 1963 by animal psychologist Glen Jensen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Glen D.|date=1963-05-01|title=Preference for bar pressing over "freeloading" as a function of number of rewarded presses.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xge/65/5/451|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|language=English|volume=65|issue=5|pages=451–454|doi=10.1037/h0049174|issn=0022-1015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his original study, around 200 [[rat]]s were given a choice between food in a bowl and a food dispenser which required that the rat step on the pedal a set number of times. In this experiment, Jensen found that the rats chose the foot pedal option as a function of the number of foot presses required to receive the food reward. Similar studies by Jensen and other researchers have since replicated his findings with gerbils and other animals including mice, rats, birds, fish, monkeys and chimpanzees. The only animal that did not display similar behavior was the domesticated cat, which preferred to be served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBF03331767 | doi=10.3758/BF03331767 | volume=24 | title=Feline indolence: Cats prefer free to response-produced food | journal=Psychonomic Science | pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dvādaśānta''' ([[Sanskrit]]: द्वादशान्त) or the ''Brahmarandhra'', meaning – having an end or limit of twelve, it is the ''twelve fingers’ breath'', the 12th centre (or ''[[Shakti|śakti]]'' in an individual) identified by some with the [[pituitary gland]], there being six centers in the brain and six below the brain. This term refers to – a) externally to the place where the breath dies away, b) internally to the crown of the skull and known as ''brahmarandhra'', and c) above the skull to the ''dvādaśānta'' which is twelve fingers breadth away from the ''brahmarandhra'', and when no longer identified with the body but with the all-pervading [[Shiva]] it is the Cosmic ''dvādaśānta'', a wheel with a thousand spokes, eternally present. ''Dvādaśānta'' is like the ''triśūla'' signifying three kinds of energy – of the will, of knowledge and of activity. The initial extremity (''ādi-koti'') is the heart (whence the breath rises) but the final extremity (''anta-koti'') is the ''dvādaśānta'' (where the breath finally dies away or rests).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kundalini: The Energy of the Depths|author=Lilian Silbum|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=31, 49|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EYWmc0gfYyIC|date=1988|isbn=9780887068003|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pratyabhijna Philosophy|author=Ganesh vasudeo Tagare|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=104|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=GW6UtkgT-CcC|date=2002|isbn=9788120818927|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abhinavagupta]] tells us that Shiva makes the [[sādhaka]] seek a worthy teacher and makes that teacher take up that task with extra responsibility and lead his [[Guru-shishya tradition|śiśya]] towards liberation. The ''ānavopāya'' ('atomic') method utilises the creative functions of Shiva and raises the ''sādhaka'' to ''śaktopāya'' ('method of power') that employs the cognitive functions of the Lord. In this and other two succeeding methods [[mantra]] transmitted by the teacher to the ''śiśya'' plays a vital role. According to the ''Devyā-yāmala- tantra'', the subtle breath composed of sound rising from the former’s heart moves through a series of centers to rest in the ''dvādaśānta'' which is the terminal point where the [[Nadi (yoga)|suśumnā]] ends and the central pathway of the three paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tantric Heart|author=Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega|publisher=SUNY Press|page=168|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ObmRkyVbgDUC|date=1989|isbn=9780887067860|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vijñānabhirava ([[Dhāraṇā]] 28 [[shloka]] 51) states:-
:यथा तथा यत्र तत्र द्वादशान्ते मनः क्षिपेत् |
:प्रतिक्षणं क्षीणवृत्तेर्वैलक्षण्यं दिनैर्भवेत् ||
which statement means that the ''ānavopāya'' involves fixation of the mind again and again at ''ūrdhava dvādaśānta'' or ''bāhya dvādaśānta'' or ''āntara dvādaśānta'' which is the incomparable and ineffable state of [[Bhairava]] (an aspect of Shiva).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yoga of Delight, Wonder and Astonishment|page=47|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=aVc5JCnO1VgC|date=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=9780791410738|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text had earlier in ''shloka'' 28 explained that meditation on ''prāṇaśakti'' arising from the ''[[Muladhara|mūladhārā chakra]]'' getting subtler and subtler dissolves in ''dvādaśānta'' to manifest Bhairava.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vijnanabhairava or Divine Consciousness|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=25|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2R2iSiMbuVwC|date=1979|isbn=9788120808201|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ''apāna'' remains in the ''dvādaśānta'', it is known as the external ''[[kumbhaka]]'' (retention of breath as in a pot). When the '' [[Prana|prāṇa]] '' moves up to the nose-tip it is known as ''recaka'' and when it moves up to the extent of the ''dvādaśānta'' it is called ''external-recaka''. The ''apāna'' moving inwards without the ''prāṇa'' is the ''internal-kumbhaka'', and the ''apāna'' rising in the ''dvādaśānta'' attaining internal expansion is the ''internal-pūraka''. According to Yoga Vasiśtha, the one who knows (experienced) these ''kumbhakas'' becomes liberated from the cycle of birth and rebirth;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Concise Yoga Vasistha|publisher=SUNY Press|page=283|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=fe_5bUKSaUEC|date=1981|isbn=9780873959551|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''dvādśānta'' represents the highest seat of God in the body, the seat of the vibrating Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Laksmi Tantra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=250,332|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=pENlKmZ4r94C|date=2000|isbn=9788120817357|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eroseanna “Sis” Robinson was an American social worker, track star, activist and member of the [[Peacemakers]] who organized for [[desegregation]] and against the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Riegle, Rosalie. Crossing the Line. Eugene, OR: Cascade Books, 2013, p.32; “Trio Ends Hunger Strike in Eatery Bias Case.” Jet Magazine, 12 Oct, 1961; “Tax Protest Turns to Jail Hunger Strike.” The Chicago Tribune, Jan. 29 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, she was an advocate of [[nonviolent resistance]] strategies. Robinson went on hunger strike or risked violence and arrest multiple times, but nonetheless won various victories for equality. Born in 1924, Robinson died at age in 52 in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;“Eroseanna Robinson.” The War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee Website, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her activism, Robinson was a successful track runner. These two interests collided when she was chosen to represent the [[United States]] in a track meet against [[Russia]] and refused to participate because she felt she was being used as a “political pawn” by appearing alongside white athletes, giving the international community the false impression that white and black people were treated equally inside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edmund. Cold War and the Income Tax: A Protest. New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1963, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==

=== Integration of Skateland ===
In 1952, Eroseanna Robinson worked at a community center in [[Cleveland]] when she decided that she would help to desegregate a public skating facility called Skateland. In trying to accomplish this goal, she pursued a non-violent plan. In her first attempt to desegregate Skateland, she brought children—two black children and one white child—from the community center at which she worked to skate. White teenagers harassed the children. Over the next few days, Robinson returned with friends who supported her cause but was continually tripped and physically assaulted by white customers at Skateland. At one point, Robinson required urgent medical attention after she was shoved, causing her to break an arm. Skateland’s management and security teams did not intervene on Robinson’s behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Wolcott, Victoria W., Race, Riots, and Roller Coasters: The Struggle Over Segregated Recreation in America. Philadelphia, 2012, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War Tax Resistance ===
In early 1960, Robinson held another nonviolent protest by refusing to pay federal taxes as a way of showing her lack of support for the United States military. Her refusal to pay taxes caused her to be sentenced to a year of imprisonment, but she used the process as an opportunity to engage in nonviolent protest. When she was sentenced, Robinson has to be carried into the courtroom on a stretcher because she refused to walk. Once she was in prison, she held a three-month fast. She was force fed through a tube and then released nine months before her sentence was complete.&lt;ref&gt;Updegrove, R.L. "Refusing to Be the Other: Barbara Deming's Experiments with Nonviolence." Diss. Northern Arizona U, 2014, Print. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restaurant Integration ===
In 1961, Eroseanna Robinson travelled along [[Route 40 (MTA Maryland)|Route 40]] in Maryland with [[Wally Nelson|Wally]] and [[Juanita Morrow Nelson|Juanita Nelson]]. The three decided to stop for dinner in [[Elkton, Maryland]], but a diner refused to serve them. The trio refused to leave until police came and arrested them, putting them in county jail. In jail, they refused to appear in court or eat. Their story was picked up by local newspapers which dubbed them the “Elkton Three.” Since the trio refused to cooperate with the court proceedings, they were given $50 fines and released. Their case sparked a local movement for desegregation that ended up gaining then Maryland Governor [[J. Millard Tawes|Millar Tawes]]’ attention and led to eventual desegregation of restaurants along Route 40.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, John W., III. "Wally and Juanita Nelson and the Struggle for Peace, Equality, and Social Justice: 1935-1975." Diss. Morgan State U, 2008. ProQuest Dissertation Publishing. Web. 9 Apr. 2017., p. 204-210.”&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Although not widely known amongst other African American civil rights activists, Robinson was instrumental in integrating several public spaces across the country in the early days of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. She is perhaps most remembered for her methods of nonviolent resistance, which were deployed in sit-ins and other pro-integration demonstrations throughout the latter part of the Civil Rights Movement.

Her work to integrate restaurants along Maryland’s Route 40 had international ramifications, as foreign diplomats would often travel the road in trips from [[Washington, D.C.]]. to [[New York City]]. In 1958, Kenyan politician [[Komla Agbeli Gbedemah|Komla Gbedema]] was denied service at a restaurant on Route 40, which embarrassed the [[Eisenhower]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, John W., III. "Wally and Juanita Nelson and the Struggle for Peace, Equality, and Social Justice: 1935-1975." Diss. Morgan State U, 2008. ProQuest Dissertation Publishing. Web. 9 Apr. 2017., p. 204.”&lt;/ref&gt; With the slogan “49 Miles of Highway and No Place to Stop and Eat,” Robinson, the Nelsons, and others were able to integrate these Maryland restaurants, which at the time hurt the United State’s international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, John W., III. "Wally and Juanita Nelson and the Struggle for Peace, Equality, and Social Justice: 1935-1975." Diss. Morgan State U, 2008. ProQuest Dissertation Publishing. Web. 9 Apr. 2017., p. 207-208.”&lt;/ref&gt; During several of Robinson’s [[hunger strike]]s, she also garnered headlines in African American publications, who lauded her relentless commitment to achieve racial justice.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, John W., III. "Wally and Juanita Nelson and the Struggle for Peace, Equality, and Social Justice: 1935-1975." Diss. Morgan State U, 2008. ProQuest Dissertation Publishing. Web. 9 Apr. 2017., p. 207-208.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson stands as an icon of the war tax resistance movement. The [[National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee]], a grassroots movement with the aim of educating American taxpayers of their rights to resist making tax contributions to war efforts, touts Robinson as a foundational figure in their movement.

Social work, as a profession, has a history of leadership within social justice movements that dates back to the work of activists like Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;Tricia B. Bent-Goodley; A Call for Social Work Activism. Soc Work 2015; 60 (2): 101-103. doi: 10.1093/sw/swv005, pg. 101.”&lt;/ref&gt; Today, social workers carry on this legacy of activism through grassroots movements such as RISE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diaz|first1=Fernanda|title=The New Generation of Activists: How Social Workers from RISE are Restoring Social Justice to their Profession|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fernanda-diaz/the-new-generation-of-act_b_781496.html|accessdate=13 April 2017|work=[[HuffPost]]|publisher=Oath Inc.|date=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eschatological verification''' describes a process whereby a proposition can be verified after death. A proposition such as "there is an afterlife" is verifiable if true but not falsifiable if false (if it's false, the individual will not know it's false, because they have no state of being). The term is most commonly used in relation to [[God]] and the [[afterlife]], although there may be other propositions - such as moral propositions - which may also be verified after death. 

[[John Hick]] has expressed the premise as an allegory of a quest to a Celestial City. In this parable, a [[theist]] and an [[atheist]] are both walking down the same road. The theist believes there is a destination, the atheist believes there is not. If they reach the destination, the theist will have been proven right; however, if there is no destination on an endless road, this can never be verified. This is an attempt to explain how a theist expects some form of life or existence after death and an atheist does not. They both have separate belief systems and live life accordingly, but logically one is right and the other is not. If the theist is right, he will be proven so when he arrives in the afterlife. However, if the atheist is right, they will simply both be dead and nothing will be verified.

This acts as a response to [[Verificationism]]. Under Hick's analogy claims about the [[afterlife]] are verifiable ''in principle'' because the truth becomes clear after death. To some extent it is therefore wrong to claim that religious language cannot be verified because it can (when you're dead).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10191">In [[psychology]], a [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristic]] is an easy-to-compute procedure or "rule of thumb" that people use when forming beliefs, judgments or decisions. The '''familiarity heuristic''' was developed based on the discovery of the [[availability heuristic]] by psychologists [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]]; it happens when the familiar is favored over novel places, people, or things. The familiarity heuristic can be applied to various situations that individuals experience in day-to-day life. When these situations appear similar to previous situations, especially if the individuals are experiencing a high [[cognitive load]], they may regress to the state of mind in which they have felt or behaved before. This heuristic is useful in most situations and can be applied to many fields of knowledge; however, there are both positives and negatives to this heuristic as well.

==Origin==

===Availability heuristic===
The familiarity heuristic stems from the [[availability heuristic]], which was studied by [[Amos Tversky|Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]]. The availability heuristic suggests that the likelihood of events is estimated based on how many examples of such events come to mind. Thus the familiarity heuristic shows how "bias of availability is related to the ease of recall."&lt;ref name="cognition"&gt;Ashcraft, M.H. (2006). ''Cognition''. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey; Pearson Education Inc. {{ISBN|013198229X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tversky and Kahneman created an experiment in order to test this heuristic. They devised four lists of 39 names. Each list contained 19 female names and 20 male names. Half of the lists had famous female names, and the other half had famous male names. They showed the lists to two test groups. The first group was shown a list and asked to recall as many names as possible. The second group was shown a list and asked to determine if there were more female or more male names. The subjects who heard the list with famous female names said there were more female names than there were male names. Similarly, the subjects who heard the list with famous male names recalled more male names than female names. Thus the familiarity heuristic is defined as "judging events as more frequent or important because they are more familiar in memory."&lt;ref name="cognition"/&gt;

The familiarity heuristic is based on using [[schema (psychology)|schemas]] or past actions as a [[scaffold]] for behavior in a new (yet familiar) situation. This is useful because it saves time for the subject who is trying to figure out the appropriate behavior for a situation they have experienced before. Individuals automatically assume that their previous behavior will yield the same results when a similar situation arises. This technique is typically useful. However, certain behaviors can be inappropriate when the situation is different from the time before.

===Hindsight bias===
The [[hindsight bias]] is the inclination to see events that have already occurred as being more predictable than they were before they took place. For example, after a situation occurs for the first time, you begin to notice it when it reoccurs and therefore because you have now experienced it, it's more readily available in your consciousness and you pull information and predict aspects of the future because of this and think that you "knew it all along." "Hindsight bias results from a biased reconstruction of the original memory trace, using the outcome as a cue"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title= Hindsight bias from 3 to 95 years of age|journal= Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume= 37|issue=2|pages= 378–391|pmid=21299327|doi=10.1037/a0021971|pmc=3084020|author1= Bernstein|first1= D. M.|last2= Erdfelder|first2= E|last3= Meltzoff|first3= A. N.|last4= Peria|first4= W|last5= Loftus|first5= G. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hindsight bias can alter memories and therefore future predictions.

==Important research==
Recent studies have used functional magnetic resonance imaging ([[fMRI]]) to demonstrate that people use different areas of the brain when reasoning about familiar and unfamiliar situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2004|title=The Hippocampal System Mediates Logical Reasoning about Familiar Spatial Environments|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience| volume =16 |issue= 4 |pages= 654–664|doi=10.1162/089892904323057362|pmid=15165354|author1=Goel|first1=V|last2=Makale|first2=M|last3=Grafman|first3=J}}&lt;/ref&gt; This holds true over different kinds of reasoning problems. Familiar situations are processed in a system involving the frontal and temporal lobes whereas unfamiliar situations are processed in the frontal and parietal lobes. These two similar but dissociated processes provide a biological explanation for the differences between heuristic reasoning and formal logic.

===Warm glow heuristic===
Corneille, Monin &amp; Pleyers (2004) showed that familiarity of human faces is based on attractiveness. In this study the researchers showed their subjects pictures of faces. The subjects were asked to rate how familiar the face was or was not using visual cues. The visual cues were choosing a picture of a butterfly (attractive) when the subject thought the face was familiar, and choosing a picture of a rat (unattractive) when the subject did not find the face familiar. The result of this study was that the subjects were more familiar when the face was attractive regardless of prior exposure to the picture (or person) itself.&lt;ref name=Corneille2004/&gt; This has been referred to as the warm glow effect (Monin 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.6.1035|pmid=14674812|title=The Warm Glow Heuristic: When Liking Leads to Familiarity|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=85|issue=6|pages=1035–48|year=2003|last1=Monin|first1=Benoît}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warm glow effect states that positive stimuli seem more familiar because of the positive emotions they evoke in us.&lt;ref name=Corneille2004&gt;{{cite journal|year=2004|title=Is positivity a cue or a response option?

==Applications==
The familiarity heuristic increases the likelihood that customers will repeatedly buy products of the same brand. This concept is known as brand familiarity in [[consumer behavior]]. Due to the familiarity heuristic, the customers have the rule of thumb that their past behavior of buying this specific brand's product was most likely correct and should be repeated. A study examining the choice of various models of microwave ovens based on the subjects' familiarity with them showed that high familiarity with the features of microwave ovens allowed for a faster and more confident choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1981|title=Familiarity and its impact on consumer decision biases and heuristics|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume= 8|pages= 223–230|doi=10.1086/208859|issue=2|last1=Park|first1=C. Whan|last2=Lessig|first2=V. Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect can also have important implications for medical decision making. Lay people tend to make health decisions that are based on familiarity and availability as opposed to factual knowledge about diseases. This means that they are more likely to take actions and pursue treatment options that have worked in the past, whether they are effective in the current situation or not. This also extends to treatments the patient has not used before but is familiar with. For example, a lay person may request a name-brand medication because they have heard of it before, even though a generic drug may be essentially the same but less expensive. Medical professionals are much more likely to use scientific facts to prescribe treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cytryn|first= K.N. |year=2001|title=Lay reasoning and decision-making related to health and illness|id=PhD Thesis, McGill University, Canada|url=http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=36903&amp;local_base=GEN01-MCG02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current criticisms==
There is some criticism of the concept of familiarity heuristic. It mainly focuses on the point that past behavior does influence present behavior but that this inherits from other, and differing contrivances. One study examining multiple possible mechanisms of how previous behavior influences the present found little support for the familiarity heuristic and tends to conclude instead that the influence of past behavior on a present one decreased when subjects were distracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2000|title=The cognitive impact of past behavior: influences on beliefs, attitudes, and future behavioral decisions|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 79|pages= 5–22|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.1.5|pmid=10909874|pmc=4807731|issue=1|author1=Albarracín|first1=D|last2=Wyer Jr|first2=R. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order for a heuristic to be valid, its effect should be more prevalent when individuals are distracted and their cognitive capacity is highly strained. This result indicates that it is unlikely that a familiarity heuristic was applied during the experiment.

Another limit of familiarity heuristic according to a study by Ouellette &amp; Wood (1998) is that it might not always be applicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1998|title=Habit and intention in everyday life: the multiple processes by which past behavior predicts future behavior|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume= 124|pages= 54–74|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.1.54|last1=Ouellette|first1=Judith A.|last2=Wood|first2=Wendy}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study showed that the familiarity heuristic might only occur in situations where the target behavior is habitual and occurs in a stable context within the situation. Thus, the familiarity heuristic could be limited to habits and behaviors in routine situations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12562">'''Frankfurt cases''' (also known as '''Frankfurt counterexamples''' or '''Frankfurt-style cases''') were presented by [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Harry Frankfurt]] in 1969 as counterexamples to the '''principle of alternate possibilities''' ('''PAP'''), which holds that an agent is [[moral responsibility|morally responsible]] for an action only if that person could have done otherwise.

==Principle of alternate possibilities==
The principle of alternate possibilities (PAP) forms part of an influential argument for the incompatibility of responsibility and causal [[determinism]], often called the ''core argument'' for [[incompatibilism]].&lt;ref name=Copp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison/&gt;&lt;ref name=Timpe/&gt; It was formulated by [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|Libertarian]] [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]]. This argument is detailed below:

(1) '''PAP''': An agent is responsible for an action only if said agent could have done otherwise.&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt;

(2) An agent could have done otherwise only if causal determinism is false.

(3) Therefore, an agent is responsible for an action only if causal determinism is false.

Traditionally, [[compatibilism|compatibilists]] (defenders of the compatibility of [[free will]] and determinism, like [[A. J. Ayer]], [[Walter Terence Stace]], and [[Daniel Dennett]]) reject premise two, arguing that, properly understood, free will is not incompatible with determinism.  According to the traditional compatibilist analysis of free will, an agent is free to do otherwise when he would have done otherwise had he wanted to do otherwise.&lt;ref name=Ayer/&gt; Agents may possess free will, according to the conditional analysis, even if determinism is true.

==Frankfurt's objection==
From the PAP definition "a person is morally responsible for what he has done only if he could have done otherwise", Frankfurt infers that a person is not morally responsible for what he has done if he could not have done otherwise – a point with which he takes issue: our theoretical ability to do otherwise, he says, does not necessarily make it ''possible'' for us to do otherwise.

Frankfurt's examples are significant because they suggest an alternative way to defend the compatibility of moral responsibility and determinism, in particular by rejecting the first premise of the argument.  According to this view, responsibility is compatible with determinism because responsibility does not require the freedom to do otherwise.

Frankfurt's examples involve agents who are intuitively responsible for their behavior even though they lack the freedom to act otherwise.  Here is a typical case:

:Donald is a Democrat and is likely to vote for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]; in fact, only in one particular circumstance will he not: that is, if he thinks about the prospects of immediate American defeat in [[Iraq]] just prior to voting.  Ms White, a representative of the Democratic Party, wants to ensure that Donald votes Democratic, so she secretly plants a device in Donald's head that, if activated, will force him to vote Democratic.  Not wishing to reveal her presence unnecessarily, Ms White plans to activate the device only if Donald thinks about the [[Iraq War]] prior to voting.  As things happen, Donald does not think about Iraq prior to voting, so Ms White thus sees no reason to activate the device, and Donald votes Democratic of his own accord.  Apparently, Donald is responsible for voting Democratic although, owing to Ms. White's device, he lacks freedom to do otherwise.

If Frankfurt is correct in suggesting both that Donald is morally responsible for voting Democratic and that he is not free to do otherwise, moral responsibility, in general, does not require that an agent have the freedom to do otherwise (that is, the principle of alternate possibilities is false).  Thus, even if causal determinism is true, and even if determinism removes the freedom to do otherwise, there is no reason to doubt that people can still be morally responsible for their behavior.

Having presented his counter argument against the principle of alternate possibilities, Frankfurt suggests that it be revised to take into account the fallacy of the notion that coercion precludes an agent from moral responsibility.  It must be ''only because'' of coercion that the agent acts as he does.  The best definition, by his reckoning, is this: "[A] person is not morally responsible for what he has done if he did it ''only because'' he could not have done otherwise."&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt;

==Criticism==
One of the first objections raised by opponents of the Frankfurt-style cases is the two-horned dilemma. This objection was most notably raised by philosophers such as Widerker, Ginet, and Kane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Significance of Free Will|last=Kane|first=Robert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ginet|first=Carl|date=1996|title=In Defense of the Principle of Alternative Possibilities: Why I Don't Find Frankfurt's Argument Convincing|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=10|pages=403-417|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Widerker|first=David|date=1995|title=Libertarianism and Frankfurt's Attack on the Principle of Alternative Possibilities|url=|journal=Philosophical Review|volume=104|pages=247-261|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-horned dilemma focuses on the connection between the agent's inclination and the agent's decision. This connection can be either deterministic or indeterministic.

If the connection between the agent's inclination and the agent's decision is deterministic, then proponents of the Frankfurt-style cases are charged with begging the question. A deterministic connection begs the question because proponents of Frankfurt-style cases are assuming the very thing that is being debated, that moral responsibility does not require alternate possibilities or the ability to do otherwise. Suppose the agent's inclination is causally sufficient for bringing about the agent's decision. This would mean that the agent was determined to make that decision prior to any kind of decision-making. Thus, the agent did not freely come to the decision for reasons of her own. Opponents of the Frankfurt-style cases would immediately contend that the agent is not morally responsible. This is because they are operating from the get-go that moral responsibility requires free will. Therefore, if the Frankfurt-style cases are operating within a metaphysically deterministic framework, then proponents of Frankfurt-style cases cannot reasonably expect their opponents to be convinced. Furthermore, Frankfurt-style cases would be begging the question since they are deriving moral responsibility from a completely deterministic scenario. 

On the other hand, if the connection between the agent's inclination and the agent's decision is indeterministic, then opponents of the Frankfurt-style cases argue that the agent has the ability to do otherwise. This is problematic for proponents of the Frankfurt-style cases because they are supposed to show a situation where an agent is morally responsible her decision and yet is unable to truly do otherwise. Suppose the agent's inclination and the agent's decision is indeterministic. This means that the agent's inclination is not necessarily indicative of what the agent's decision will be. Thus, it is possible for the agent to show the correct inclination, evade the computer device, but then make the "wrong" decision. Even if the computer device kicks in after the "wrong decision," the agent still encountered the ability to do otherwise. This kind of Frankfurt-style case would fail to present a situation where an agent is morally responsible while lacking alternate possibilities. 

== Responses ==
There have been a number of responses to the two-horned dilemma. One response has been to argue that a deterministic connection does not actually beg the question. Fischer has argued for this response by arguing that the Frankfurt-style case cannot stand alone, but must be taken in conjunction with other arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Martin|date=1999|title=Recent Work on Moral Responsibility|url=|journal=Ethics|volume=110|pages=93-139|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These other arguments are supposed to show that causal determinism in and of itself and apart from ruling out alternate possibilities does not threaten moral responsibility. 

A second response is to revise the Frankfurt-style cases. This revision consist in creating a case with an explicit indeterministic connection where the agent is still morally responsible without any alternate possibilities. These kind of Frankfurt-style cases do it by incorporating buffer zones that act to eliminate alternate possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=David|date=2005|title=Moral Responsibility and Buffered Alternatives|url=|journal=Midwest Studies in Philosophy|volume=29|pages=126-145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of these responses are still being debated. It remains to be seen whether the Frankfurt style cases are successfully in showing what Harry Frankfurt intended them to show.

== Legacy ==
[[Michael Otsuka]] provides a more specific answer to proposed problems with Frankfurt's counterexamples.  In his article, Otsuka says,&lt;ref name=Otsuka/&gt;
"my strategy is to propose that the Principle of Alternate Possibilities be rejected in favor of a different incompatibilist principle,"  that is, different from Frankfurt's, "that I call the 'Principle of Avoidable Blame'."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1629">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[topology]], a '''free loop''' is a variant of the mathematical notion of a [[Loop (topology)|loop]].  Whereas a loop has a distinguished point on it, called a basepoint, a free loop lacks such a distinguished point.  Formally, let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[topological space]].  Then a free loop in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an [[equivalence class]] of [[continuous function]]s from the [[circle]] &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  Two loops are equivalent if they differ by a reparameterization of the circle.  That is, &lt;math&gt;f \sim g&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a [[homeomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\psi : S^1 \rightarrow S^1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g = f\circ\psi&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, a free loop, as opposed to a based loop used in the definition of the [[fundamental group]], is a map from the circle to the space without the basepoint-preserving restriction.  Free homotopy classes of free loops correspond to [[conjugacy class]]es in the fundamental group.

Recently, interest in the space of all free loops &lt;math&gt;LX&lt;/math&gt; has grown with the advent of [[string topology]], i.e. the study of new algebraic structures on the [[singular homology|homology]] of the free loop space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37431">The '''Global 200''' is the list of [[ecoregion]]s identified by [[World Wide Fund for Nature|
WWF]], the global conservation organization, as priorities for conservation. According to WWF, an ecoregion is defined as a "relatively large unit of land or water containing a characteristic set of natural communities that share a large majority of their species dynamics, and environmental conditions".&lt;ref&gt;Olson, D. M. &amp; E. Dinerstein. 1998. The Global 200: A representation approach to conserving the Earth’s most biologically valuable ecoregions. ''Conservation Biol.'' 12:502–515.[http://planet.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Biodiversity/pdf/OlsonDinerstein1998.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, D. M., Dinerstein, E. 2002. The Global 200: Priority ecoregions for global conservation. ''Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden'' 89(2):199-224, [http://coastalforests.tfcg.org/pubs/Global%20200%20ecoregion.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Nature Conservancy. 1997. ''Designing a geography of hope: guidelines for ecoregion-based conservation in The Nature Conservancy''. The Nature Conservancy, Arlington, Virginia&lt;/ref&gt; So, for example, based on their levels of [[endemism]], Madagascar gets multiple listings, ancient Lake Baikal gets one, and the North American Great Lakes get none. 

The WWF assigns a conservation status to each ecoregion in the Global 200: '''critical or endangered'''; '''vulnerable'''; and '''relatively stable or intact'''. Over half of the ecoregions in the Global 200 are rated endangered.
{{TOC limit|3}}
==Background==
The WWF has identified 867 [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s across the Earth's land surface, as well as [[freshwater ecoregion|freshwater]] and [[marine ecoregion]]s. The goal of this classification system is to ensure that the full range of [[ecosystem]]s will be represented in regional conservation and development strategies. Of these ecoregions, the WWF selected the Global 200 as the ecoregions most crucial to the [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] of global [[biodiversity]]. The Global 200 list actually contains 238 ecoregions, made up of 142 terrestrial, 53 freshwater, and 43 marine ecoregions.

[[conservation movement|Conservationist]]s interested in preserving biodiversity have generally focused on the preservation of [[tropical moist broadleaf forests]] (commonly known as tropical rainforests) because it is estimated that they harbor one half of Earth's species. On the other hand, the WWF determined that a more comprehensive strategy for conserving global biodiversity should also consider the other half of species, as well as the [[ecosystem]]s that support them.

Several habitats, such as [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] [[biome]], were determined to be more threatened than tropical rain forests, and therefore require concerted conservation action. WWF maintains that "although conservation action typically takes place at the country level, patterns of biodiversity and ecological processes (e.g., migration) do not conform to political boundaries", which is why ecoregion-based conservation strategies are deemed essential.

===Classification===
Historically, zoologists and botanists have developed various classification systems that take into account the world's plant and animal communities. Two of the worldwide classification systems most commonly used today were summarized by [[Miklos Udvardy]] in 1975.

The Earth's land surface can be divided into eight [[biogeographical realms]] (formerly called kingdoms, and which the BBC calls [[ecozone]]s) that represent the major terrestrial communities of animals and plants, and are a synthesis of previous systems of [[floristic province]]s and faunal regions. The biome system classifies the world into ecosystem types (i.e. forests, grasslands, etc.) based on climate and vegetation. Each biogeographical realm contains multiple biomes, and biomes occur across several biogeographical realms. A system of [[biogeographical provinces]] was developed to identify specific geographic areas in each biogeographical realm that were of a consistent biome type, and shared distinct plant and animal communities. The WWF system represents a further refinement of the system of biomes (which the WWF calls "major habitat types"), biogeographical realms, and biogeographical provinces (the WWF scheme divides most biogeographical provinces into multiple smaller ecoregions).

===Selection process===
Based on a comprehensive list of [[ecoregion]]s, The Global 200 includes all major habitat types (biomes), all [[ecosystem]] types, and [[species]] from every major habitat type. It focuses on each major habitat type of every continent (such as [[tropical forest]]s or [[coral reef]]s). It uses [[ecoregion]]s as the unit of scale for comparison. WWF say ecoregions could be considered as conservation units at regional scale because they meet similar biological communities.

Some ecoregions were selected over other ecoregions of the same major habitat type (biome) or ecozone. Selection of the Global 200 relied on extensive studies of 19 terrestrial, freshwater, and marine major habitat types. Selection of the ecoregions was based on analyses of species richness, species [[endemic (ecology)|endemism]], unique higher [[taxon|taxa]], unusual ecological or evolutionary phenomena, and global rarity of major habitat type.

Global 200 ecoregion list is most helpful to conservation efforts at a regional scale: local [[deforestation]], destruction of swamp habitats, degradation of soils, etc. However, certain phenomena, such as bird or whale [[Fish migration|migration]], depend on more complex parameters not used to define the current [[database]], such as atmospheric currents and dynamic [[pelagic]] ecosystems. These would require gathering more information, and co-ordination of efforts between multiple ecoregions. However, the Global 200 ecoregions can help these efforts by identifying habitat sites and resting sites for migratory animals. It may also help identify the origin of [[invasive species]], and offer insights for slowing down or stopping their intrusion.

[[Image:Greek manuscript minuscule Aristotle.png|thumb|right|250px|Later minuscule, 15th-century manuscript of [[Aristotle]].]]
The '''minuscule''' script was a [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] writing style which was developed as a book hand in [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] manuscripts during the 9th and 10th centuries.&lt;ref name="thompson"/&gt; It replaced the earlier style of [[uncial script|uncial]] writing, from which it differed in using smaller, more rounded and more connected letter forms, and in using a large number of [[Greek ligatures|ligatures]]. Many of these forms had previously developed as parts of more informal [[cursive]] writing. The basic letter shapes used in the minuscule script are the ancestors of modern [[lower case]] Greek letters.

From the 10th century onwards, most Byzantine manuscripts of classical and early Christian Greek works were gradually rewritten in the new minuscule style, and few of the older uncial manuscripts were preserved. For this reason, uncial manuscripts are today extremely rare, while early minuscule manuscripts are often the oldest preserved sources attesting an ancient work and may therefore be of central importance for its [[philology|philological]] study. Manuscripts from the oldest phase of minuscule writing (mid-9th to mid-10th century) are known in scholarship today as ''codices vetustissimi'' ("oldest codices"). Those from the mid-10th to the mid-12th centuries are known as ''codices vetusti'' ("old codices"), and later ones as ''codices recentiores'' ("newer codices").&lt;ref name="thompson159"/&gt;

Minuscule writing remained in use for handwriting throughout the Byzantine and into the post-Byzantine era. In the modern era, western printers used minuscule book hands as a model for developing early Greek print fonts. Like with Latin, it became common to mix minuscule writing with some uncial or [[Capital letter|capital]] letters, with the latter used for emphasis, in titles and initials. From this practice, the modern orthographic system of [[letter case]] for Greek arose. In modern Greek writing, the upper case letters are generally modeled on the letter shapes of ancient inscriptions, while the lower case letters are based on the tradition of minuscule handwriting.

== History ==
The first online community to use the term "incel" was started in 1993 when a Canadian college student known only by her first name, Alana, created a website in order to discuss her sexual inactivity with others.&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/24/incel-sexual-frustration-rebellion-at-center-toronto-attack.html|title='Incel' sexual frustration 'rebellion' at center of Toronto attack|last=Schallhorn|first=Kaitlyn|date=April 24, 2018|work=[[Fox News]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/08/intel-involuntary-celibate-movement-218324|title=How 'Incel' Got Hijacked|last=Zimmer|first=Ben|date=May 8, 2018|work=[[Politico]]|access-date=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elle.com/culture/news/a34512/woman-who-started-incel-movement/|title=The Woman Who Accidentally Started the Incel Movement|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=March 1, 2016|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website, titled "Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project",&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt; was used by people of all genders to share their thoughts and experiences.  In 1997, she started a mailing list on the topic that used the abbreviation INVCEL, which was later shortened to "incel", where it was defined as "anybody of any gender who was lonely, had never had sex or who hadn't had a relationship in a long time".&lt;ref name="bbcaug302018"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45284455|title=The woman who founded the 'incel' movement|last=Taylor|first=Jim|date=August 30, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=August 30, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her college career and after, she realized she was [[queer]], and became more comfortable with her identity. She later gave the site to a stranger.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; When speaking about the website in 2018, Alana said, "It definitely wasn't a bunch of guys blaming women for their problems. That's a pretty sad version of this phenomenon that's happening today. Things have changed in the last 20 years."&lt;ref name="bbcaug302018" /&gt;

The message board love-shy.com was founded in 2003 as a place for people who were perpetually rejected or extremely shy of potential partners to discuss their situations.&lt;ref name="Dewey2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[/r/incels]] [[subreddit]], a forum on the website [[Reddit]], became a particularly active incel community. The subreddit was known as a place where men blamed women for their involuntary celibacy, sometimes advocated for rape or other violence, and were misogynistic and often racist.&lt;ref name="Solon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/reddit-violence-policy.html|title=Reddit Bans Nazi Groups and Others in Crackdown on Violent Content|last=Hauser|first=Christine|date=October 26, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; One post titled "general question about how rapists get caught" was asked by a member pretending to be a woman, saying they wanted to know how a woman who was drugged and raped would begin finding her rapist.&lt;ref name="Solon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-41926687|title=Reddit bans 'involuntarily celibate' community|last=Bell|first=Chris|date=November 9, 2017|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Alana read about the [[2014 Isla Vista killings]], and the way parts of the incel subculture glorified the perpetrator, Elliot Rodger,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; she wrote, "Like a scientist who invented something that ended up being a weapon of war, I can't uninvent this word, nor restrict it to the nicer people who need it."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Alana expressed regret at the change in usage from her original intent of creating an "inclusive community" for men and women who were sexually deprived due to social awkwardness, marginalization, or mental illness.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/25/woman-who-invented-incel-movement-interview-toronto-attack|title=Woman behind 'incel' says angry men hijacked her word 'as a weapon of war'|last1=Kassam|first1=Ashifa|date=April 26, 2018|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since started a new project, "Love Not Anger", which she describes as "a project to research how lonely people might find respectful love, instead of being stuck in anger".&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

On October 25, 2017, Reddit announced a new policy that would ban "content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  and banned the /r/incels subreddit on November 7, 2017, under its purview. At the time of the ban, the community had around 40,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/technology/incels-reddit-banned.html|title=Reddit Bans 'Incel' Group for Inciting Violence Against Women|last=Hauser|first=Christine|date=November 9, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Incels came to wider public notice with the banning of the subreddit and when a series of mass murders were committed by men who either self-identified as involuntarily celibate or shared similar ideologies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elle.com/life-love/sex-relationships/a33782/involuntary-celibacy/|title=What Happens to Men Who Can't Have Sex|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=February 29, 2016|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However the incel community continued to inhabit Reddit.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; Increased interest in incel communities has been attributed to the feeling of "aggrieved entitlement" by some men, who feel they are being denied rights they deserve and blame women instead of society's expectation of [[masculinity]].&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

The incel subculture includes people who are in [[sexless marriage]]s (or other sexless relationships) but who wish to be sexually active. It is considered to be distinct from [[asexuality]] and from voluntary [[Abstinence|sexual abstinence]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donnelly|first=Denise|last2=Burgess|first2=Elisabeth|last3=Anderson|first3=Sally|last4=Davis|first4=Regina|last5=Dillard|first5=Joy|date=2001|title=Involuntary Celibacy: A life course analysis|url=http://cda.morris.umn.edu/~meeklesr/celibacy.html|journal=[[The Journal of Sex Research]]|volume=38|issue=2|pages=159–169|doi=10.1080/00224490109552083|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
"Involuntary celibacy" is not a medical or psychological condition. Some people who identify as incel suffer from physical disabilities or psychological disorders such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[autism spectrum disorder]], and [[body dysmorphic disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/05/we-must-try-understand-how-unwanted-virginity-leads-self-hating-incels-murder|title=We must try to understand how unwanted virginity leads self-hating incels to murder|last=Tait|first=Amelia|date=May 8, 2018|website=[[New Statesman]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some visitors of incel forums attribute their inability to find a partner to physical or mental ailments, some others attribute it to extreme introversion.

== Mass murders and violence ==
Some mass murders and other violent attacks in North America have been committed or are suspected to have been committed by men who have self-identified as involuntarily celibate, or whose statements align with incel ideologies.

On May 23, 2014, Elliot Rodger [[2014 Isla Vista killings|killed six people and injured fourteen others]] before killing himself in [[Isla Vista, California|Isla Vista]], [[California]], near the campus of [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. These killings drew media attention to the concept of involuntary celibacy, and particularly the misogyny and glorification of violence that are a mainstay of many incel communities. Rodger self-identified as an incel and left behind a 137-page manifesto and [[YouTube]] videos detailing his involuntary celibacy and discussing how he wanted revenge for being rejected by women.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/05/24/the-disturbing-internet-footprint-of-santa-barbara-shooter-elliot-rodger/ |title=The Disturbing Internet Footprint Of Santa Barbara Shooter Elliot Rodger|last=Hill|first=Kashmir|date=May 24, 2014|work=[[Forbes]]|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/us/elliot-rodger-killings-in-california-followed-years-of-withdrawal.html|title=Elliot O.

Rodger is among several attackers who are regularly praised by members of incel communities. The perpetrator of the [[2009 Collier Township shooting]], George Sodini, has been embraced by some of these communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]] by [[Stephen Paddock]] (a man with unclear motive), some of the involuntarily celibate community celebrated the shooter, who they felt was a hero who was targeting "normies".&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The trend has since continued—after the 2018 Toronto van attack, a poster on a website created to supersede /r/incels wrote about suspected perpetrator Alek Minassian, "I hope this guy wrote a manifesto because he could be our next new saint."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; After the 2018 [[Danforth shooting]], posters on an incel message board expressed excitement with the possibility that the perpetrator might be an incel, although no motive has been identified.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/incels-looksmaxing-obsession_us_5b50e56ee4b0de86f48b0a4f|title=Inside Incels' Looksmaxing Obsession: Penis Stretching, Skull Implants And Rage|last=Cook|first=Jesselyn|date=July 24, 2018|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2015, Chris Harper-Mercer killed nine people and injured eight others before killing himself in a [[Umpqua Community College shooting|shooting at the Umpqua Community College]] campus in [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]], [[Oregon]]. He left a manifesto at the scene, outlining his interest in other mass murders including the Isla Vista killings, anger at not having a girlfriend, and animus towards the world.

On December 7, 2017, William Atchison killed two people before killing himself in [[Aztec, New Mexico|Aztec]], [[New Mexico]], in a [[Aztec High School shooting|shooting at Aztec High School]], where he had previously been a student. He had used the pseudonym "Elliot Rodger" on several online forums, and praised "the supreme gentleman" (a term Rodger had used to describe himself, which has since been adopted as a moniker by incel communities).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/20180205/alt-right-killing-people|title=The Alt-Right is Killing People|last=Hankes|first=Keegan|date=February 5, 2018|work=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]|access-date=May 14, 2018|last2=Amend|first2=Alex|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Incel communities have been widely criticized in the media and by researchers as violent, misogynist, and extremist.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":WaPo-Houston-etc" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst working for the Southern Poverty Law Center, has cautioned that exposure to violent content on incel forums "play[s] a very large role" in the radicalization of incels, and describes violent posts on the forums as "more&amp;nbsp;... than I'm used to seeing on even white supremacist sites".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Journalist [[David Futrelle]] has described incel communities as "violently misogynistic", and is among critics who attribute worsening violent rhetoric on incel forums to the growth of the alt-right and white supremacy, and the overlap between incel communities and online hate groups.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/online-extremism-radical-misogyny_us_5b491358e4b0bc69a787458f|title=Internet Giants Are Banning Extremists (Just Not The Ones Targeting Women)|last=Cook|first=Jesselyn|date=July 27, 2018|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4167152/toronto-van-attack-incel-alek-minassian-violence/|title=Expert traces link between violent online alt-right fantasies and real-world attacks|last=Cain|first=Patrick|date=April 27, 2018|work=[[Global News]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior research fellow at the [[Institute for Strategic Dialogue]] (ISD), [[Amarnath Amarasingam]], has criticized some incel communities where calls for violence are commonplace, saying "under the right set of psychological and personal circumstances, these kinds of forums can be dangerous and push people into violence".&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt; Another researcher at the ISD, Jacob Davey, compared the radicalization of incels in incel forums to teenagers being urged to go to extreme measures on online [[Pro-ana|forums that promote anorexia and other eating disorders]] and to online campaigns convincing people to join [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]. Speaking about incels' feelings of entitlement to sex, Davey said the attitude "can go as far as the justification of rape". [[University of Portsmouth]] lecturer Lisa Sugiura has described incel forums as a "networked misogyny", and urged the posts in such forums be taken seriously not only in the context of [[hate speech]] but also as a form of grooming that could radicalize "impressionable and vulnerable disillusioned young men".&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/rise-women-haters-inside-dark-world-british-incels/|title=Rise of the women haters: Inside the dark world of the British 'incels'|last=Tait|first=Amelia|date=August 18, 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=September 1, 2018|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[combinatorics]] (combinatorial mathematics), the '''inclusion–exclusion principle''' is a counting technique which generalizes the familiar method of obtaining the number of elements in the [[union (set theory)|union]] of two finite [[set (mathematics)|set]]s; symbolically expressed as
:&lt;math&gt; |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' and ''B'' are two finite sets and |''S''| indicates the [[cardinality]] of a set ''S'' (which may be considered as the number of elements of the set, if the set is [[Finite set|finite]]). The formula expresses the fact that the sum of the sizes of the two sets may be too large since some elements may be counted twice. The double-counted elements are those in the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the two sets and the count is corrected by subtracting the size of the intersection.

The principle is more clearly seen in the case of three sets, which for the sets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|.&lt;/math&gt;
This formula can be verified by counting how many times each region in the [[Venn diagram]] figure is included in the right-hand side of the formula. In this case, when removing the contributions of over-counted elements, the number of elements in the mutual intersection of the three sets has been subtracted too often, so must be added back in to get the correct total.

[[Image:Inclusion-exclusion.svg|thumb|Inclusion–exclusion illustrated by a Venn diagram for three sets]]

Generalizing the results of these examples gives the principle of inclusion–exclusion.  To find the cardinality of the union of {{mvar|n}} sets:

# Include the cardinalities of the sets.
# Exclude the cardinalities of the pairwise intersections.
# Include the cardinalities of the triple-wise intersections.
# Exclude the cardinalities of the quadruple-wise intersections.
# Include the cardinalities of the quintuple-wise intersections.
# Continue, until the cardinality of the {{mvar|n}}-tuple-wise intersection is included (if {{mvar|n}} is odd) or excluded ({{mvar|n}} even).

The name comes from the idea that the principle is based on over-generous ''inclusion'', followed by compensating ''exclusion''.
This concept is attributed to [[Abraham de Moivre]] (1718);&lt;ref name="Roberts 2009 loc=pg. 405"&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Tesman|2009|loc=pg. 405}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it first appears in a paper of [[Daniel da Silva (mathematician)|Daniel da Silva]] (1854),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazur|2010|loc=pg. 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in a paper by [[J. J. Sylvester]] (1883).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc=pg. 77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the principle is referred to as the formula of Da Silva, or Sylvester due to these publications. The principle is an example of the [[Sieve theory|sieve method]] extensively used in [[number theory]] and is sometimes referred to as the ''sieve formula'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc = pg. 77}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Legendre already used a similar device in a sieve context in 1808.

As finite probabilities are computed as counts relative to the cardinality of the probability space, the formulas for the principle of inclusion–exclusion remain valid when the cardinalities of the sets are replaced by finite probabilities. More generally, both versions of the principle can be put under the common umbrella of [[measure theory]].

In a very abstract setting, the principle of inclusion–exclusion can be expressed as the calculation of the inverse of a certain matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1986|loc=pg. 64}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inverse has a special structure, making the principle an extremely valuable technique in combinatorics and related areas of mathematics. As [[Gian-Carlo Rota]] put it:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Rota|first=Gian-Carlo|title=On the foundations of combinatoial theory I. Theory of Möbius functions|journal=Zeitschrift für Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie|volume=2|year=1964|pages=340–368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One of the most useful principles of enumeration in discrete probability and combinatorial theory is the celebrated principle of inclusion–exclusion. When skillfully applied, this principle has yielded the solution to many a combinatorial problem."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Statement==
In its general form, the principle of inclusion–exclusion states that for finite sets {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, one has the identity
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right| = {} &amp; \sum_{i=1}^n |A_i| - \sum_{1 \le i &lt; j \le n} |A_i\cap A_j| + \cdots {} \\
&amp; {} \cdots + \sum_{1 \le i &lt; j &lt; k \le n} |A_i \cap A_j\cap A_k| - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} \left|A_1\cap\cdots\cap A_n\right|.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

[[Image:inclusion-exclusion-3sets.png|thumb|Each term of the inclusion–exclusion formula gradually corrects the count until finally each portion of the [[Venn diagram]] is counted exactly once.]]

This can be compactly written as
:::&lt;math&gt;
\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right| = \sum_{k = 1}^n (-1)^{k+1} \left( \sum_{1 \leq i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \leq n} | A_{i_1} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i_k} | \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
or
:::&lt;math&gt;
\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right| = \sum_{\emptyset\neq J\subseteq\{1,2,\ldots,n\}}(-1)^{|J|-1} \Biggl|\bigcap_{j\in J} A_j\Biggr|.
&lt;/math&gt;

In words, to count the number of elements in a finite union of finite sets, first sum the cardinalities of the individual sets, then subtract the number of elements that appear in at least two sets, then add back the number of elements that appear in at least three sets, then subtract the number of elements that appear in at least four sets, and so on. This process always ends since there can be no elements that appear in more than the number of sets in the union. (For example, if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;, there can be no elements that appear in more than &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; sets; equivalently, there can be no elements that appear in at least &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; sets.)

In applications it is common to see the principle expressed in its complementary form. That is, letting {{mvar|S}} be a finite [[universal set]] containing all of the {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and letting &lt;math&gt;\bar{A_i}&lt;/math&gt; denote the complement of {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in {{mvar|S}}, by [[De Morgan's laws]] we have
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left|\bigcap_{i=1}^n \bar{A_i}\right| = \left|S - \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right| \\
= {} &amp; |S| - \sum_{i=1}^n |A_i| + \sum_{1 \le i &lt; j \le n} |A_i\cap A_j| 
- \cdots + (-1)^n |A_1\cap\cdots\cap A_n|.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

As another variant of the statement, let {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be a list of properties that elements of a set {{mvar|S}} may or may not have, then the principle of inclusion–exclusion provides a way to calculate the number of elements of {{mvar|S}} which have none of the properties. Just let {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the subset of elements of {{mvar|S}} which have the property {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and use the principle in its complementary form. This variant is due to [[J. J. Sylvester]].&lt;ref name="Roberts 2009 loc=pg. 405"/&gt;

==Examples==

===Counting integers===
As a simple example of the use of the principle of inclusion–exclusion, consider the question:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazur|2010|loc=pp. 83–4, 88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::How many integers in {1,...,100} are not divisible by 2, 3 or 5?
Let ''S'' = {1,...,100} and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; the property that an integer is divisible by 2, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the property that an integer is divisible by 3 and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; the property that an integer is divisible by 5. Letting ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; be the subset of ''S'' whose elements have property ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; we have by elementary counting: |''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;| = 50, |''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;| = 33, and |''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;| = 20. There are 16 of these integers divisible by 6, 10 divisible by 10 and 6 divisible by 15. Finally, there are just 3 integers divisible by 30, so the number of integers not divisible by any of 2, 3 or 5 is given by:
:::  100 − (50 + 33 + 20) + (16 + 10 + 6) − 3 = 26.

===Counting derangements===
A more complex example is the following.
 
Suppose there is a deck of ''n'' cards numbered from 1&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;''n''.  Suppose a card numbered ''m'' is in the correct position if it is the ''m''th card in the deck. How many ways, ''W'', can the cards be shuffled with at least 1 card being in the correct position?

Begin by defining set ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, which is all of the orderings of cards with the ''m''th card correct.  Then the number of orders, ''W'', with ''at least'' one card being in the correct position, ''m'', is

: &lt;math&gt;W = \left|\bigcup_{m=1}^n A_m\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

Apply the principle of inclusion–exclusion,

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
W = {} &amp; \sum_{m_1=1}^n |A_{m_1}| - \sum_{1 \le m_1 &lt; m_2 \le n} |A_{m_1} \cap A_{m_2}| +\cdots \\[5pt]
&amp; \cdots + \sum_{1 \le m_1 &lt; m_2 &lt; m_3 \le n} |A_{m_1} \cap A_{m_2} \cap A_{m_3}| - \cdots \\[5pt]
&amp; \cdots + (-1)^{p-1} \sum_{1 \le m_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; m_p \le n} |A_{m_1} \cap \cdots \cap A_{m_p}| \cdots. 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Each value &lt;math&gt;A_{m_1} \cap \cdots \cap A_{m_p}&lt;/math&gt; represents the set of shuffles having at least ''p'' values ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; in the correct position.  Note that the number of shuffles with at least ''p'' values correct only depends on ''p'', not on the particular values of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, the number of shuffles having the 1st, 3rd, and 17th cards in the correct position is the same as the number of shuffles having the 2nd, 5th, and 13th cards in the correct positions.  It only matters that of the ''n'' cards, 3 were chosen to be in the correct position.  Thus there are &lt;math&gt;{n \choose p}&lt;/math&gt; equal terms in the ''p''th summation (see [[combination]]).

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
W = {} &amp; {n \choose 1} |A_1| - {n \choose 2} |A_1 \cap A_2| + {n \choose 3} |A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3| - \cdots \\[4pt]
&amp; \cdots + (-1)^{p-1} {n \choose p} |A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_p| \pm \cdots.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;|A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_p|&lt;/math&gt; is the number of orderings having ''p'' elements in the correct position, which is equal to the number of ways of ordering the remaining ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'' elements, or (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'')&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Thus we finally get:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
W = {} &amp; {n \choose 1} (n-1)!  - {n \choose 2} (n-2)!  + {n \choose 3} (n-3)!  - \cdots \\[5pt]
&amp; \cdots + (-1)^{p-1} {n \choose p} (n-p)! \pm \cdots. \\[8pt]
W  &amp; = \sum_{p=1}^n (-1)^{p-1} {n \choose p} (n-p)!. 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Noting that &lt;math&gt;{n \choose p} = \frac{n!}{p!(n-p)!}&lt;/math&gt;, this reduces to

: &lt;math&gt;
W  = \sum_{p=1}^n (-1)^{p-1}\, \frac{n!}{p!}.
&lt;/math&gt;

A permutation where ''no'' card is in the correct position is called a [[derangement]]. Taking ''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt; to be the total number of permutations, the probability ''Q'' that a random shuffle produces a derangement is given by

: &lt;math&gt;Q = 1 - \frac{W}{n!} = \sum_{p=0}^n \frac{(-1)^p}{p!}, &lt;/math&gt;

a truncation to ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 terms of the [[Taylor series|Taylor expansion]] of ''e''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Thus the probability of guessing an order for a shuffled deck of cards and being incorrect about every card is approximately 1/''e'' or 37%.

==A special case==

The situation that appears in the derangement example above occurs often enough to merit special attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=pp. 167–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Namely, when the size of the intersection sets appearing in the formulas for the principle of inclusion–exclusion depend only on the number of sets in the intersections and not on which sets appear. More formally, if the intersection

:&lt;math&gt;A_J:=\bigcap_{j\in J} A_j&lt;/math&gt;

has the same cardinality, say ''α&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' = |''A&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''|, for every ''k''-element subset ''J'' of {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''}, then

:&lt;math&gt;\biggl|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\biggr|  =\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1}\binom nk \alpha_k.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, in the complementary form, where the universal set ''S'' has cardinality α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\biggl|S \setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\biggr|  =\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k}\binom nk \alpha_k.&lt;/math&gt;

==A generalization==

Given a [[family of sets|family (repeats allowed) of subsets]] ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of a universal set ''S'', the principle of inclusion–exclusion calculates the number of elements of ''S'' in none of these subsets. A generalization of this concept would calculate the number of elements of ''S'' which appear in exactly some fixed ''m'' of these sets.

Let ''N'' = &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; = {1,2,...,''n''}. If we define &lt;math&gt;A_{\emptyset} = S&lt;/math&gt;, then the principle of inclusion–exclusion can be written as, using the notation of the previous section; the number of elements of ''S'' contained in none of the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is:
::&lt;math&gt; \sum_{J \subseteq [n]} (-1)^{|J|} |A_J|.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''I'' is a fixed subset of the index set ''N'', then the number of elements which belong to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i'' in ''I'' and for no other values is:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|1994|loc=pg. 78}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{I \subseteq J} (-1)^{|J| - |I|} |A_J|.&lt;/math&gt;
Define the sets

:&lt;math&gt;B_k = A_{I \cup \{ k \}} \text{ for } k \in N \setminus I.&lt;/math&gt;

We seek the number of elements in none of the ''B''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; which, by the principle of inclusion–exclusion (with &lt;math&gt;B_\emptyset = A_I&lt;/math&gt;), is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{K \subseteq N \setminus I} (-1)^{|K|}|B_K|.&lt;/math&gt;

The correspondence ''K'' ↔ ''J'' = ''I'' ∪ ''K'' between subsets of ''N''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''I'' and subsets of ''N'' containing ''I'' is a bijection and if ''J'' and ''K'' correspond under this map then ''B''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, showing that the result is valid.

==In probability==

In [[probability]], for events ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in a [[probability space]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})&lt;/math&gt;, the inclusion–exclusion principle becomes for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(A_1\cup A_2)=\mathbb{P}(A_1)+\mathbb{P}(A_2)-\mathbb{P}(A_1\cap A_2),&lt;/math&gt;

for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{P}(A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3)=\mathbb{P}(A_1)+\mathbb{P}(A_2)+\mathbb{P}(A_3)
\qquad{}-\mathbb{P}(A_1\cap A_2)-\mathbb{P}(A_1\cap A_3)-\mathbb{P}(A_2\cap A_3)
\qquad{}+\mathbb{P}(A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3)
&lt;/math&gt;

and in general

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{P}\biggl(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\biggr) {} =\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{P}(A_i)
-\sum_{i&lt;j}\mathbb{P}(A_i\cap A_j) 
\qquad+\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}\mathbb{P}(A_i\cap A_j\cap A_k)-\ \cdots\ +(-1)^{n-1}\, \mathbb{P}\biggl(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i\biggr),
&lt;/math&gt;

which can be written in closed form as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}\biggl(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\biggr)  =\sum_{k=1}^n \left((-1)^{k-1}\sum_{\scriptstyle I\subset\{1,\ldots,n\}\atop\scriptstyle|I|=k} \mathbb{P}(A_I)\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the last sum runs over all subsets ''I'' of the indices 1, ..., ''n'' which contain exactly ''k'' elements, and

:&lt;math&gt;A_I:=\bigcap_{i\in I} A_i&lt;/math&gt;

denotes the intersection of all those ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' with index in ''I''.

According to the [[Boole's inequality#Bonferroni inequalities|Bonferroni inequalities]], the sum of the first terms in the formula is alternately an upper bound and a lower bound for the [[Sides of an equation|LHS]]. This can be used in cases where the full formula is too cumbersome.

For a general [[measure space]] (''S'',Σ,''μ'') and [[measurable]] subsets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of finite measure, the above identities also hold when the probability measure &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the measure ''μ''.

===Special case===

If, in the probabilistic version of the inclusion–exclusion principle, the probability of the intersection ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; only depends on the cardinality of ''I'', meaning that for every ''k'' in {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''} there is an ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;a_k=\mathbb{P}(A_I) \text{ for every } I\subset\{1,\ldots,n\} \text{ with } |I|=k,&lt;/math&gt;

then the above formula simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right) =\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1}\binom n k a_k &lt;/math&gt;

due to the combinatorial interpretation of the [[binomial coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\binom nk&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if the events &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[independent and identically distributed]], then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(A_i) = p&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i'', and we have &lt;math&gt;a_k = p^k&lt;/math&gt;, in which case the expression above simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right) = 1 - (1-p)^n. &lt;/math&gt;

(This result can also be derived more simply by considering the intersection of the complements of the events &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;.)

An analogous simplification is possible in the case of a general measure space (''S'',Σ,''μ'') and measurable subsets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of finite measure.

==Other forms==

The principle is sometimes stated in the form&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graham| Grötschel|Lovász|1995|loc=pg. 1049}}&lt;/ref&gt; that says that if

:&lt;math&gt;g(A)=\sum_{S\;:\;S\;\subseteq\;A}f(S)&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;f(A)=\sum_{S\;:\;S\;\subseteq\;A}(-1)^{|A|-|S|}g(S) \qquad (**)&lt;/math&gt;

The combinatorial and the probabilistic version of the inclusion–exclusion principle are instances of (**).
{{collapse top|title=Proof}}
Take &lt;math&gt;\underline{m} = \{1,2,\ldots,m\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(\underline{m}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and

:&lt;math&gt;f(S)=\left|\bigcap_{i \in \underline{m} \setminus S} A_i \setminus \bigcup_{i \in S} A_i\right| \text{ and } f(S) = \mathbb{P} \left(\bigcap_{i \in \underline{m} \setminus S} A_i \setminus \bigcup_{i \in S} A_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;

respectively for all [[set (mathematics)|sets]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;S \subsetneq \underline{m}&lt;/math&gt;. Then we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;g(A)=\left|\bigcap_{i \in \underline{m} \setminus A} A_i\right|, \quad g(\underline{m}) = \left|\bigcup_{i \in \underline{m}} A_i \right| \text{ and } g(A) = \mathbb{P} \left( \bigcap_{i \in \underline{m} \setminus A} A_i \right),~~ g(\underline{m}) = \mathbb{P} \left(\bigcup_{i \in \underline{m}} A_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;

respectively for all sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A \subsetneq \underline{m}&lt;/math&gt;. This is  because [[element (mathematics)|elements]] &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i \in \underline{m} \setminus A} A_i&lt;/math&gt; can be [[element (mathematics)#notation|contained]] in other &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;'s (&lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;'s with &lt;math&gt;i \in A&lt;/math&gt;) as well, and the &lt;math&gt;\cap \setminus \cup\!\text{-}&lt;/math&gt;formula runs exactly through all possible extensions of the sets &lt;math&gt;\{A_i \mid i \in \underline{m} \setminus A\}&lt;/math&gt; with other &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;'s, counting &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; only for the set that matches the membership behavior of  &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; runs through all [[subset]]s of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (as in the definition of &lt;math&gt;g(A)&lt;/math&gt;).

Since &lt;math&gt;f(\underline{m}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain from (**) with &lt;math&gt;A = \underline{m}&lt;/math&gt; that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\underline{m} \supseteq T \supsetneq \varnothing}(-1)^{|T|-1} g(\underline{m} \setminus T) = \sum_{\varnothing \subseteq S \subsetneq \underline{m}}(-1)^{m-|S|-1} g(S) = g(\underline{m})&lt;/math&gt;

and by interchanging sides, the combinatorial and the probabilistic version of the inclusion–exclusion principle follow.

If one sees a number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; as a set of its prime factors, then (**) is a generalization of [[Möbius inversion formula]] for [[square-free integer|square-free]] [[natural number]]s. Therefore, (**) is seen as the Möbius inversion formula for the [[incidence algebra]] of the [[partially ordered set]] of all subsets of ''A''.

For a generalization of the full version of Möbius inversion formula, (**) must be generalized to [[multiset]]s. For multisets instead of sets, (**) becomes

:&lt;math&gt;f(A)=\sum_{S\subseteq A}\mu(A - S)g(S)\qquad(***)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A - S&lt;/math&gt; is the multiset for which &lt;math&gt;(A - S) \uplus S = A&lt;/math&gt;, and

* ''μ''(''S'') =  1 if ''S'' is a set (i.e. a multiset without double elements) of [[even and odd numbers|even]] [[cardinality]].
* ''μ''(''S'') =  &amp;minus;1 if ''S'' is a set (i.e. a multiset without double elements) of odd cardinality.
* ''μ''(''S'') =  0 if ''S'' is a proper multiset (i.e. ''S'' has double elements).

Notice that ''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;math&gt;(A - S)&lt;/math&gt; is just the &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{\left|A\right|-\left|S\right|}&lt;/math&gt; of (**) in case &lt;math&gt;A - S&lt;/math&gt; is a set.

{{collapse top|title=Proof of (***)}}
Substitute

:&lt;math&gt;g(S)=\sum_{T\subseteq S}f(T)&lt;/math&gt;

on the right hand side of (***). Notice that &lt;math&gt;f(A)&lt;/math&gt; appears once on both sides of (***). So we must show that for all &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;T\subsetneq A&lt;/math&gt;, the terms &lt;math&gt;f(T)&lt;/math&gt; cancel out on the right hand side of (***). For that purpose, take a fixed &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T\subsetneq A&lt;/math&gt; and take an arbitrary fixed &lt;math&gt;a \in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a \not\in T&lt;/math&gt;.

Notice that &lt;math&gt;A - S&lt;/math&gt; must be a set for each [[Positive number|positive]] or [[negative number|negative]] appearance of &lt;math&gt;f(T)&lt;/math&gt; on the right hand side of (***) that is obtained by way of the multiset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T \subseteq S \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;. Now each appearance of &lt;math&gt;f(T)&lt;/math&gt; on the right hand side of (***) that is obtained by way of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A - S&lt;/math&gt; is a set that contains &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; cancels out with the one that is obtained by way of the corresponding &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A - S&lt;/math&gt; is a set that does not contain &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. This gives the desired result.

==Applications==

The inclusion–exclusion principle is widely used and only a few of its applications can be mentioned here.

===Counting derangements===

{{main|Derangement}}

A well-known application of the inclusion–exclusion principle is to the combinatorial problem of counting all [[derangement]]s of a finite set.  A ''derangement'' of a set ''A'' is a [[bijection]] from ''A'' into itself that has no fixed points. Via the inclusion–exclusion principle one can show that if the cardinality of ''A'' is ''n'', then the number of derangements is [''n''!&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''e''] where [''x''] denotes the [[nearest integer function|nearest integer]] to ''x''; a detailed proof is available [[Random permutation statistics#Number of permutations that are derangements|here]] and also see [[#Examples|the examples section]] above.

The first occurrence of the problem of counting the number of derangements is in an early book on games of chance: ''Essai d'analyse sur les jeux de hazard'' by P. R. de Montmort (1678 &amp;ndash; 1719) and was known as either "Montmort's problem" or by the name he gave it, "''problème des rencontres''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc=pp. 77-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is also known as the ''hatcheck problem.''

The number of derangements is also known as the [[subfactorial]] of ''n'', written !''n''. It follows that if all bijections are assigned the same probability then the probability that a random bijection is a derangement quickly approaches 1/''e'' as ''n'' grows.

===Counting intersections===
The principle of inclusion–exclusion, combined with [[De Morgan's law]], can be used to count the cardinality of the intersection of sets as well. Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\overline{A}_k&lt;/math&gt; represent the complement of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to some universal set ''A'' such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A_k\, \subseteq\, A&lt;/math&gt; for each ''k''. Then we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i = \overline{\bigcup_{i=1}^n \overline{A}_i}
&lt;/math&gt;

thereby turning the problem of finding an intersection into the problem of finding a union.

===Graph coloring===
The inclusion exclusion principle forms the basis of algorithms for a number of NP-hard graph partitioning problems, such as graph coloring.&lt;ref name="bhk"&gt;{{harvnb|Björklund|Husfeldt|Koivisto|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well known application of the principle is the construction of the [[chromatic polynomial]] of a graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|2008|loc=pp. 211–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bipartite graph perfect matchings===
The number of [[perfect matching]]s of a [[bipartite graph]] can be calculated using the principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|2008|loc=pp. 208–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of onto functions===
Given finite sets ''A'' and ''B'', how many [[surjective function]]s (onto functions) are there from ''A'' to ''B''? [[Without any loss of generality]] we may take ''A'' = {1,2,...,''k''} and ''B'' = {1,2,...,''n''}, since only the cardinalities of the sets matter. By using ''S'' as the set of all [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] from ''A'' to ''B'', and defining, for each ''i'' in ''B'', the property ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; as "the function misses the element ''i'' in ''B''" (''i'' is not in the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of the function), the principle of inclusion&amp;ndash;exclusion gives the number of onto functions between ''A'' and ''B'' as:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazur|2008|loc=pp.84-5, 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^{n} \binom{n}{j} (-1)^j (n-j)^k.&lt;/math&gt;

===Permutations with forbidden positions===
A [[permutation]] of the set ''S'' = {1,2,...,''n''} where each element of ''S'' is restricted to not being in certain positions (here the permutation is considered as an ordering of the elements of ''S'') is called a ''permutation with forbidden positions''. For example, with ''S'' = {1,2,3,4}, the permutations with the restriction that the element 1 can not be in positions 1 or 3, and the element 2 can not be in position 4 are: 2134, 2143, 3124, 4123, 2341, 2431, 3241, 3421, 4231 and 4321. By letting ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the set of positions that the element ''i'' is not allowed to be in, and the property ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to be the property that a permutation puts element ''i'' into a position in ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, the principle of inclusion–exclusion can be used to count the number of permutations which satisfy all the restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=pp. 177&amp;ndash;81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the given example, there are 12 = 2(3!) permutations with property ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 6 = 3! permutations with property ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and no permutations have properties ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or ''P''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as there are no restrictions for these two elements. The number of permutations satisfying the restrictions is thus:
::4! − (12 + 6 + 0 + 0) + (4) = 24 − 18 + 4 = 10.
The final 4 in this computation is the number of permutations having both properties ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. There are no other non-zero contributions to the formula.

===Stirling numbers of the second kind===
{{main|Stirling numbers of the second kind}}

The [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]], ''S''(''n'',''k'') count the number of [[Partition of a set|partitions]] of a set of ''n'' elements into ''k'' non-empty subsets (indistinguishable ''boxes''). An explicit formula for them can be obtained by applying the principle of inclusion–exclusion to a very closely related problem, namely, counting the number of partitions of an ''n''-set into ''k'' non-empty but distinguishable boxes ([[Ordered set|ordered]] non-empty subsets). Using the universal set consisting of all partitions of the ''n''-set into ''k'' (possibly empty) distinguishable boxes, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, and the properties ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; meaning that the partition has box ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; empty, the principle of inclusion–exclusion gives an answer for the related result. Dividing by ''k''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt; to remove the artificial ordering gives the Stirling number of the second kind:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=pp. 282&amp;ndash;7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;S(n,k) = \frac 1 {k!}\sum_{t=0}^k (-1)^t \binom k t (k-t)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

===Rook polynomials===
{{main|Rook polynomial}}

A rook polynomial is the [[generating polynomial|generating function]] of the number of ways to place non-attacking [[rook (chess)|rooks]] on a ''board B'' that looks like a subset of the squares of a [[checkerboard]]; that is, no two rooks may be in the same row or column.  The board ''B'' is any subset of the squares of a rectangular board with ''n'' rows and ''m'' columns; we think of it as the squares in which one is allowed to put a rook. The [[coefficient]], ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''B'') of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; in the rook polynomial ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the number of ways ''k'' rooks, none of which attacks another, can be arranged in the squares of ''B''. For any board ''B'', there is a complementary board ''B' '' consisting of the squares of the rectangular board that are not in ''B''. This complementary board also has a rook polynomial  ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''B' ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') with coefficients ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''B''').

It is sometimes convenient to be able to calculate the highest coefficient of a rook polynomial in terms of the coefficients of the rook polynomial of the complementary board. Without loss of generality we can assume that ''n'' ≤ ''m'', so this coefficient is ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''B''). The number of ways to place ''n'' non-attacking rooks on the complete ''n'' × ''m'' "checkerboard" (without regard as to whether the rooks are placed in the squares of the board ''B'') is given by the [[falling factorial]]:
::&lt;math&gt;(m)_n = m(m-1)(m-2) \cdots (m-n+1).&lt;/math&gt;
Letting ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; be the property that an assignment of ''n'' non-attacking rooks on the complete board has a rook in column ''i'' which is not in a square of the board ''B'', then by the principle of inclusion–exclusion we have:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Tesman|2009|loc=pp.419&amp;ndash;20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; r_n(B) = \sum_{t=0}^n (-1)^t (m-t)_{n-t}\; r_t(B'). &lt;/math&gt;

===Euler's phi function===
{{main|Euler's totient function}}

Euler's totient or phi function, ''φ''(''n'') is an [[arithmetic function]] that counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to ''n'' that are [[relatively prime]] to ''n''. That is, if ''n'' is a [[positive integer]], then φ(''n'') is the number of integers ''k'' in the range 1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n'' which have no common factor with ''n'' other than 1. The principle of inclusion–exclusion is used to obtain a formula for φ(''n''). Let ''S'' be the set {1,2,...,''n''} and define the property ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to be that a number in ''S'' is divisible by the prime number ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, for 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''r'', where the [[prime factorization]] of

:&lt;math&gt;n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_r^{a_r}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc=pg. 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\varphi(n) = n - \sum_{i=1}^r \frac{n}{p_i} + \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq r} \frac{n}{p_i p_j} - \cdots = n \prod_{i=1}^r \left (1 - \frac{1}{p_i} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

==Diluted inclusion–exclusion principle==
{{See also|Bonferroni inequalities}}

In many cases where the principle could give an exact formula (in particular, counting [[prime number]]s using the [[sieve of Eratosthenes]]), the formula arising doesn't offer useful content because the number of terms in it is excessive. If each term individually can be estimated accurately, the accumulation of errors may imply that the inclusion–exclusion formula isn't directly applicable. In [[number theory]], this difficulty was addressed by [[Viggo Brun]]. After a slow start, his ideas were taken up by others, and a large variety of [[sieve theory|sieve methods]] developed. These for example may try to find upper bounds for the "sieved" sets, rather than an exact formula.

Let ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be arbitrary sets and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; real numbers in the closed unit interval &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0,1&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Then, for every even number ''k'' in {0, ..., ''n''}, the [[indicator function]]s satisfy the inequality:&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fernández|Fröhlich|Alan D.|1992|loc=Proposition&amp;nbsp;12.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;1_{A_1\cup\cdots\cup A_n} \ge \sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{j-1}\sum_{1\le i_1&lt;\cdots&lt;i_j\le n} p_{i_1} \dots p_{i_j} \, 1_{A_{i_1} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i_j}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof of main statement==

Choose an element contained in the union of all sets and let &lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, \dots, A_t&lt;/math&gt; be the individual sets containing it. (Note that ''t'' &amp;gt; 0.) Since the element is counted precisely once by the left-hand side of equation ({{EquationNote|1}}), we need to show that it is counted precisely once by the right-hand side. On the right-hand side, the only non-zero contributions occur when all the subsets in a particular term contain the chosen element, that is, all the subsets are selected from &lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, \dots, A_t&lt;/math&gt;. The contribution is one for each of these sets (plus or minus depending on the term) and  therefore is just the (signed) number of these subsets used in the term. We then have: 
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; |\{A_i \mid 1 \leq i \leq t\}| - |\{A_i \cap A_j \mid 1 \leq i &lt; j \leq t\}| + \cdots \\[4pt]
&amp; \qquad \cdots + (-1)^{t+1}|\{A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots  \cap A_t\}| \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \binom{t}{1} - \binom{t}{2} + \cdots + (-1)^{t+1}\binom{t}{t}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[binomial theorem]],

:&lt;math&gt; 0 = (1-1)^t= \binom{t}{0} - \binom{t}{1} + \binom{t}{2} - \cdots + (-1)^t\binom{t}{t}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the fact that &lt;math&gt;\binom{t}{0} = 1&lt;/math&gt; and rearranging terms, we have
: &lt;math&gt;
1 = \binom{t}{1} - \binom{t}{2} + \cdots + (-1)^{t+1}\binom{t}{t},&lt;/math&gt;

and so, the chosen element is  counted only once by the right-hand side of equation ({{EquationNote|1}}).

===Algebraic proof===
An algebraic proof can be obtained using [[indicator function]]s (characteristic functions of subsets of a set). The indicator function of a subset ''S'' of a set ''X'' is a function

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_S \colon X \to \{ 0,1 \} &lt;/math&gt;

defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_S(x) :=
\begin{cases} 
1 &amp;\text{if } x \in S, \\
0 &amp;\text{if } x \notin S.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are two subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A \cdot\mathbf{1}_B = \mathbf{1}_{A\cap B}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''A'' denote the union &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i&lt;/math&gt; of the sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  To prove the inclusion–exclusion principle in general, we first verify the identity

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;1_A  =\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1} \sum_{I\subset\{1,\ldots,n\} \atop|I| = k} 1_{A_I}&lt;/math&gt;|∗}}

for indicator functions, where
:&lt;math&gt;A_I = \bigcap_{i\in I} A_i.&lt;/math&gt;

The following function is identically zero

:&lt;math&gt;(1_A-1_{A_1})(1_A-1_{A_2})\cdots(1_A-1_{A_n})\,=\,0,&lt;/math&gt;

because: if ''x'' is not in ''A'', then all factors are 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;0 = 0; and otherwise, if ''x'' does belong to some  ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, then the corresponding ''m''th factor is&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. By expanding the product on the left-hand side, equation (∗) follows.

To prove the inclusion–exclusion principle for the cardinality of sets, sum the equation (∗) over all ''x'' in the union of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. To derive the version used in probability, take the [[expected value|expectation]] in (∗). In general, [[Lebesgue integral|integrate]] the equation (∗) with respect to&amp;nbsp;''μ''. Always use linearity in these derivations.

'''Krvna Osveta''' ({{lang-sr|Крвна освета}}, '''''[[Blood feud]]''''') is a [[law]] of [[Feud|vendetta]] in [[Montenegro]] and [[Herzegovina]], practised by [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]], [[Bosniaks]] and [[Albanians of Montenegro|Albanian families]] throughout history since medieval times. It is an oath of revenge for vendetta, meaning that the person must take revenge on whomever killed his relative by killing the murderer or one of the murderer's close relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Zora Latinovic, ''Krvna Osveta'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice started in [[the Balkans]] in the 15th century, under [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] rule and the law decreased in the 19th century, when the Balkan countries slowly got their independence from the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="glas-javnosti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2005/07/29/srpski/F05072802.shtml |title=glas-javnosti |publisher=arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-Ottoman [[Serbian lands|Serbian principalities]], [[blood money (term)|blood money]] (''Vražda'') was paid, one half went to the Serbian Orthodox Church, while the other to the victim's family. Stefan Uroš (1240–1272) talks about the Vražda in his works. After Ottoman conquest of [[Serbia]], self-governing clans often feuded with each other. Families in Serbia abandoned the tradition as the bigger threats to family integrity was ethnic Albanians and Turks rather than of their own ethnic group.

When a family member has been killed, the perpetrator's family&lt;sup&gt;(Bratstva)&lt;/sup&gt; has a "Blood debt" (''krvni dug'') which can only be removed when the victim's family (an appointed member, ''osvetnik'') has had their revenge by killing the aggressor or any member of the murderer's family (Often a close male kinsman, preferably the brother, killing of children was not encouraged). Only then has the family of the victim received peace (However, the blood feud continues if a relative decides to revenge, disregardless of who started).&lt;ref name="BF" /&gt; However, killing in your own house is the worst action, representing unmorality, which is a great shame in Montenegrin and Albanian cultures. If a criminal was murdered, it often did not result in a feud as criminality was negative in the eyes of society, but in some cases the criminal's family went on to kill serdars and other high ranked people.

*In Montenegro, the feuds were predominantly among [[Montenegrins]] and [[Albanians of Montenegro|ethnic Albanians]] themselves.
*In Herzegovina (currently a region of both Montenegro and [[Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina]]) [[Montenegrins]] had feuds with each other. A neutral region was Grahovo and Vučja Zuba (triangle of [[Boka Kotorska]], [[Montenegro]] and Herzegovina) where blood feuds were not recorded.
*In [[Old Serbia]] ([[Kosovo]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]) If a Serb had a weak family, he could be protected by an Albanian bratstva from other [[Albanians]] in exchange for anything from [[weapons]] or [[folk attire]] [[textile|material]] (Serbs had rich textile art in the southern Serbian regions)

The Osveta is not limited to males, females that have their husbands or relatives killed could take on the ''blood debt'', an instance is recorded from the [[Bjelopavlići (clan)|Bjelopavlići clan]], where a widow took out revenge for the murder of her husband.&lt;ref name="BF"&gt;{{Google books |id=oq4B2WGT9mYC |title=Blood Revenge: The Enactment and Management of Conflict in Montenegro and Other Tribal Societies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a bratstva finds and captures a thief or murderer (in connection to the bratstva) they could go to the person's house or relatives and tell them that their relative is a murderer or thief and end with something like "If we kill him, we are not to be held for" If the relatives answers "Do what you like with him" -the bratstva, if they kill the captive, they don't have a blood debt to his relatives because they settled his fate.

The blood feuds resulted in major instability in Montenegro, Kosovo and diaspora of Montenegrins in later centuries. In [[Kosovo]], most cases of blood feuds were reconciled in the early 1990s in the course of a large-scale reconciliation movement to end blood feuds led by [[Anton Çetta]].&lt;ref name="BJC2017"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://academic.oup.com/bjc/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bjc/azx002/2990197 |title=Did Nonviolent Resistance Fail in Kosovo? |last1=Marsavelski |first1=Aleksandar |last2=Sheremeti |first2=Furtuna |last3=Braithwaite |first3=John |website=British Journal of Criminology |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest reconciliation gathering took place at Verrat e Llukës on 1 May 1990, which had between 100,000 and 500,000 participants. By 1992 the reconciliation campaign ended at least 1,200 deadly blood feuds, and in 1993 not a single homicide occurred in Kosovo.&lt;ref name="BJC2017" /&gt;

Bürgi's '''Kunstweg''' is a set of [[algorithm]]s invented by [[Jost Bürgi]] at the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref name="staudacher"&gt;Staudacher, S., 2014.  Jost Bürgi, Kepler und der Kaiser.  Verlag NZZ, Zürich.&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used for the calculation of [[sine]]s to an arbitrary precision. Bürgi used these algorithms to calculate a [[Canon Sinuum (Bürgi)|Canon Sinuum]], a table of sines in steps of 2 [[arc seconds]]. It is thought that this table had 8 sexagesimal places. Some authors have speculated that this table only covered the range from 0 to 45 degrees, but nothing seems to support this claim. Such tables were extremely important for [[navigation]] at sea. [[Johannes Kepler]] called the Canon Sinuum the most precise known table of sines (reference?). Bürgi explained his algorithms in his work [[Fundamentum Astronomiae]] which he presented to Emperor Rudolf II. in 1592.

The principles of iterative sine table calculation through the Kunstweg are as follows: cells in a column sum up the values of the two previous cells in the same [[column]]. The final cell's value is divided by two, and the next iteration starts. Finally, the values of the last column get normalized. Rather accurate [[approximations]] of sines are obtained after few iterations.

As recently as 2015, Folkerts et al. showed that this simple process converges indeed towards the true sines.&lt;ref name="folkerts"&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2015arXiv151003180F|arxiv=1510.03180|title=Jost Bürgi's Method for Calculating Sines|volume=1510|pages=17|author1=Folkerts|first1=Menso|last2=Launert|first2=Dieter|last3=Thom|first3=Andreas|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Folkerts, this was the first step towards [[difference calculus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11707">The '''Legend of the Octopus''' is a sports tradition during [[Detroit Red Wings]] home playoff games involving dead [[octopus]]es thrown onto the [[Ice hockey rink|ice rink]]. The origins of the activity go back to the [[1951–52 NHL season|1952 playoffs]], when a [[National Hockey League]] team played two best-of-seven series to capture the [[Stanley Cup]].  Having eight arms, the octopus symbolized the number of playoff wins necessary for the Red Wings to win the Stanley Cup. The practice started April 15, 1952, when Pete and Jerry Cusimano, brothers and storeowners in [[Eastern Market, Detroit|Detroit's Eastern Market]], hurled an octopus into the rink of [[Detroit Olympia|The Old Red Barn]]. The team swept the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[Montreal Canadiens]] en route to winning the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redwings.ice.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=43781|title=Legend of the Octopus|accessdate=2013-09-27|work=[[Detroit Red Wings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Since 1952, the practice has persisted with each passing year. In one 1995 game, fans threw 36 octopuses, including a specimen weighing {{Convert|38|lb|kg|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benvin|first=Paul|url=http://thehockeywriters.com/8-legged-freaks-the-legend-of-detroits-lucky-octopi/|title=8 Legged Freaks: The Legend of Detroit's Lucky Octopi|work=The Hockey Writers|date=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Wings' unofficial mascot is a purple octopus named [[Al the Octopus|Al]], and during playoff runs, two of these mascots were also hung from the rafters of [[Joe Louis Arena]], symbolizing the 16 wins now needed to take home the Stanley Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Vincent M.|last=Mallozzi|title=Wrapping His Arms Around the Red Wings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/sports/hockey/20cheer.html|website=The New York Times|date=May 20, 2007|accessdate=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice has become such an accepted part of the team's lore, fans have developed various techniques and "octopus etiquette" for launching the creatures onto the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E0DA1139F937A25757C0A960958260|title=When Octopuses Are Flying in Detroit It's...|accessdate=June 11, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Keith | last=Bradsher | date=1996-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events inspired by the octopus ==
The octopus tradition has launched several other object-tossing moments:

During Game 3 of the [[1995 Stanley Cup Finals]] between the Detroit Red Wings and the [[New Jersey Devils]], Devils fans threw a lobster, a dead fish, and other objects onto the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sandra|last=McKee|title=Devils dominate Red Wings, 5-2 1995 STANLEY CUP FINALS|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-06-23/sports/1995174119_1_red-wings-jersey-devils-stanley-cup|website=The Baltimore Sun|date=June 23, 1995|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2006 Stanley Cup playoffs]], during the opening-round series between the Wings and the [[Edmonton Oilers]], an Edmonton radio host suggested throwing Alberta Beef on the ice before the game. Oilers fans continued throwing steaks, even at away games, resulting in several arrests at the away cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/796/story/448204.html|title=Beef chucking ends|accessdate=October 1, 2007|last=Brevorka|first=Jennifer|date=June 8, 2006|work=[[The News &amp; Observer]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003440/http://www.newsobserver.com/796/story/448204.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2002–03 season, the [[Nashville Predators]] fans began throwing [[catfish]] onto their home ice, in response to the Red Wings tradition. The first recorded instance occurred on October 26, 2002 in a game between the Red Wings and the Predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01EED81038F935A25752C1A9659C8B63|title=Predators Knock the Isles Off Their Feet|accessdate=May 11, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Joe | last=Lapointe | date=November 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jessica Hanley, who helps clean the ice in the [[Bridgestone Arena|Gaylord Entertainment Center]], told the press: "They are so gross. They're huge, they're heavy, they stink and they leave this slimy trail on the ice. But, hey, if it's good for the team, I guess we can deal with it." This tradition continued in Game 3 of the 2008 Western Conference Quarterfinals matchup between the Detroit Red Wings and the Nashville Predators when Predator fans threw four catfish onto the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preps.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080415/SPORTS02/804150374/0/PREPSFACTORY03|archive-url=https://archive.is/20090216201501/http://preps.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080415/SPORTS02/804150374/0/PREPSFACTORY03|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 16, 2009|title=Ellis gets job done, earns first playoff victory|accessdate=May 11, 2008|work=The Tennessean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Game 4 of the 2007 Stanley Cup Western Conference Semifinals between the Detroit Red Wings and the [[San Jose Sharks]], a Sharks fan threw a 3-foot [[leopard shark]] onto the ice at the [[SAP Center|HP Pavilion at San Jose]] after the Sharks scored their first goal with 2 minutes left in the first period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinij.com/ci_7129022?source=most_viewed|title=Far-flung: The strange story of a man, a plan, the NHL playoffs and a dead fish|accessdate=December 4, 2008|work=The Marin IJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2008 Stanley Cup Finals]], in which the Red Wings defeated the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], seafood wholesalers in [[Pittsburgh]], led by [[Wholey's|Wholey's Fish Market]], began requiring identification from customers who purchased octopuses, refusing to sell to buyers from [[Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Want to buy an octopus?

In Game 1 of the 2010 Western Conference Quarterfinals between the Detroit Red Wings and the [[Phoenix Coyotes]], a rubber snake was thrown onto the ice after a goal by the Coyotes' [[Keith Yandle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wyshynski |first=Greg |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/Great-moments-in-slithery-Fans-throw-snakes-on-?urn=nhl,234343 |title=Great moments in slithery: Fans throw snakes on Coyotes ice – Puck Daddy – NHL Blog – Yahoo! Sports |work=Sports.yahoo |date= |accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Game 2 of the 2010 Western Conference Semifinals between the Detroit Red Wings and San Jose Sharks, a small shark was tossed onto the ice with an octopus inside its mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wyshynski |first=Greg |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/Inside-story-of-how-shark-with-octopus-hit-the-i?urn=nhl,238543 |title=Inside story of how shark with octopus hit the ice in San Jose|work=Sports.yahoo |date= |accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Game 3 of the 2017 Western Conference Finals between the [[Anaheim Ducks]] and the Nashville Predators, a Predators fan threw a skinned duck on the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Gonzales|title=Meet the man who threw a skinned duck onto the ice during the Predators' Game 3 win|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/nhl/predators/2017/05/18/meet-man-who-threw-skinned-duck-onto-ice-during-predators-game-3-win/330795001/|website=The Tennessean|date=May 19, 2017|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Twirling ban ==
[[Al Sobotka]], the head ice manager at [[Little Caesars Arena]] and one of the two [[Ice resurfacer|Zamboni]] drivers, is the person who retrieves the thrown octopuses from the ice. When the Red Wings played at Joe Louis Arena, he was known to twirl an octopus above his head as he walked across the ice rink to the Zamboni entrance.&lt;ref name="dfp1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080419/SPORTS05/804190350/1053/SPORTS05 |title=NHL bans octopus swinging; $10,000 fine for offenders |accessdate=May 10, 2008 |work=[[Detroit Free Press]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501054720/http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080419%2FSPORTS05%2F804190350%2F1053%2FSPORTS05 |archivedate=May  1, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 19, 2008, NHL director of hockey operations [[Colin Campbell (ice hockey executive)|Colin Campbell]] sent the Red Wings a memo that forbade Zamboni drivers from cleaning up any octopuses thrown onto the ice and imposed a $10,000 fine for violating the mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=George|last=Malik|title=Octopus twirl now illegal, punishable by $10,000 fine|url=http://blog.mlive.com/snapshots/2008/04/octopus_twirl_now_illegal_puni.html|website=MLive|date=April 19, 2008|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Official (ice hockey)#Linesmen|linesmen]] were instead instructed to perform any clean-up duties.

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}

A '''lineage''' in [[Buddhism]] is a line of transmission of the Buddhist teaching that is "theoretically traced back to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself."{{sfn|Haskel|2001|p=2}} The acknowledgement of the transmission can be oral, or certified in documents. Several branches of Buddhism, including [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] (including [[Zen]] and [[Korean Seon|Seon]]) and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] maintain records of their historical teachers. These records serve as a validation for the living exponents of the tradition.

The historical authenticity of Buddhist lineage is questionable. [[Stephen Batchelor (author)|Stephen Batchelor]] has claimed, speaking about specifically Japanese Zen lineage, "the historicity of this “lineage” simply does not withstand critical scrutiny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Batchelor|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Batchelor (author)|title=The Lessons of History|url=http://www.stephenbatchelor.org/index.php/en/the-lessons-of-history|journal=Tricycle: The Buddhist Review|volume =10| issue =2|date=Winter 2000|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erik Storlie has noted that transmission "is simply false on historical grounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Storlie|first=Erik|title=Lineage Delusions: Eido Shimano Roshi, Dharma Transmission, and American Zen|url=http://sweepingzen.com/lineage-delusions-eido-shimano-roshi-dharma-transmission-and-american-zen/|publisher=Sweeping Zen|date=February 8, 2011|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Conze]] said "much of the traditions about the early history of Chan are the inventions of a later age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conze|first=Edward|authorlink=Edward Conze|title=Buddhism: Its Essence and Development|page=201|publisher=Courier Corporation|year=2003|ISBN=9780486430959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vinaya==
In the lineage of the [[vinaya]], the requirements for ordination as a [[bhikkhu]] ("monk") or a [[bhikkhuni]] ("nun") include the presence of at least five other monks, one of whom must be a fully ordained preceptor, and another an acharya (teacher). This lineage for ordaining bhikshunis became extinct in the [[Theravada]] school and in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Therefore, when [[samanera|śrāmaṇerikā]]s like [[Tenzin Palmo]] wanted full ordination, she had to travel to [[Hong Kong]].

==Mahasiddha==
Lineages in the [[Mahasiddha]] tradition do not necessarily originate from Gautama Buddha, but are ultimately grounded, like all Buddhist lineages, in the [[Adi-Buddha]].

==Chan and Zen lineages==
{{main|Zen lineage charts|Dharma transmission}}

===Construction of lineages===
The idea of a patriarchal lineage in Chan Buddhism dates back to the [[epitaph]] for Fărú (法如 638–689), a disciple of the 5th patriarch, Hóngrĕn (弘忍 601–674). In the ''[[Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices]]'' and the ''Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks'', Daoyu and Huike are the only explicitly identified disciples of Bodhidharma. The epitaph gives a line of descent identifying Bodhidharma as the first patriarch.{{sfn|Dumoulin|1993|p=37}}{{sfn|Cole|2009|p=73–114}}

In the 6th century biographies of famous monks were collected. From this genre the typical Chan-lineage was developed:
{{quote|These famous biographies were non-sectarian. The Ch'an biographical works, however, aimed to establish Ch'an as a legitimate school of Buddhism traceable to its Indian origins, and at the same time championed a particular form of Ch'an. Historical accuracy was of little concern to the compilers; old legends were repeated, new stories were invented and reiterated until they too became legends.{{sfn|Yampolski|2003|p=5-6}}}}

[[D. T. Suzuki]] contends that Chan's growth in popularity during the 7th and 8th centuries attracted criticism that it had "no authorized records of its direct transmission from the founder of Buddhism" and that Chan historians made [[Bodhidharma]] the 28th patriarch of Buddhism in response to such attacks.{{sfn|Suzuki|1949|p=168}}

===Six patriarchs===
The earliest lineages described the lineage from Bodhidharma to Huineng. There is no generally accepted 7th Chinese Patriarch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MISC/mag83546.htm 禪宗第七祖之爭的文獻研究]&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle teachers of the Chan, Zen and Seon traditions are commonly known in English translations as "[[Patriarch]]s". However, the more precise terminology would be "Ancestors" or "Founders" ({{zh|c=祖|p=zǔ}}) and "Ancestral Masters" or "Founding Masters" ({{zh|c=祖師|zǔshī}}), as the commonly used Chinese terms are gender neutral. Various records of different authors are known, which give a variation of transmission lines:

{{Zen Lineage Six Patriarchs}}

===Continuous lineage from Gautama Buddha===
Eventually these descriptions of the lineage evolved into a continuous lineage from Gautama Buddha to Bodhidharma. The idea of a line of descent from Gautama is the basis for the distinctive lineage tradition of Chan.

According to the ''[[Song of Enlightenment]]'' (證道歌 ''Zhèngdào gē'') by Yǒngjiā Xuánjué (665-713),{{sfn|Chang|1967}} one of the chief disciples of [[Huineng]], Bodhidharma was the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism in a line of descent from Gautama Buddha through his disciple [[Mahākāśyapa]]:
{{quote|Mahakashyapa was the first, leading the line of transmission;&lt;br/&gt;
Twenty-eight Fathers followed him in the West;&lt;br/&gt;
The Lamp was then brought over the sea to this country;&lt;br/&gt;
And Bodhidharma became the First Father here&lt;br/&gt;
His mantle, as we all know, passed over six Fathers,&lt;br/&gt;
And by them many minds came to see the Light.{{sfn|Suzuki|1948|p=50}}}}

The ''[[Denkoroku]]'' gives 28 patriarchs in this transmission,{{sfn|Cook|2003}}{{sfn|Diener|1991|p=266}} and 53 overall:

{{Zen Lineage 28 Patriarchs}}

===Transmission to Japan===
Twenty-four different Zen lineages are recorded to be transmitted to Japan. Only three survived until today. [[Sōtō]] was transmitted to Japan by [[Dōgen]], who travelled to [[China]] for Chan training in the [[13th century]]. After receiving [[Dharma transmission]] in the [[Caodong school]], he returned to Japan and established the lineage there, where it is called the [[Sōtō]].

The [[Linji school]] was also transmitted to Japan several times, where it is the [[Rinzai school]].

==Jōdo Shinshū==
In [[Jōdo Shinshū]], "Patriarch" refers to seven Indian, Chinese and Japanese masters before its founder, [[Shinran]].

==Tibetan Buddhism==
The 14th [[Dalai Lama]], in the foreword to ''Karmapa: The Sacred Prophecy''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Karmapa: The Sacred Prophecy|last=|first=|publisher=Kagyu Thubten Choling Publications Committee|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Within the context of Tibetan Buddhism, the importance of lineage extends far beyond the ordinary sense of a particular line of inheritance or descent. Lineage is a sacred trust through which the integrity of Buddha's teachings is preserved intact as it is transmitted from one generation to the next. The vital link through which the spiritual tradition is nourished and maintained is the profound connection between an enlightened master and perfectly devoted disciple. The master-disciple relationship is considered extremely sacred by all the major schools of Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Chöd===
[[Chöd]] is an advanced spiritual practice known as "Cutting Through the Ego."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodhicitta.net/Chod.htm|title=Chod - Cutting Through the Ego|last=Rinpoche|first=Yangthang |year=1991|accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice, based on the [[Prajnaparamita]] sutra, uses specific [[meditation]]s and [[Vajrayana|tantric]] ritual.

There are several [[hagiography|hagiographic]] accounts of how chöd came to Tibet.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|last=Edou|first=Jérôme|title=Machig Labdrön and the Foundations of Chöd|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=1996|isbn=978-1-55939-039-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQULAAAAYAAJ&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One [[Namtar (biography)|''namtar'']] (hagiography) asserts that shortly after [[Kamalaśīla]] won his famous debate with [[Moheyan]] as to whether Tibet should adopt the "sudden" route to enlightenment or his own "gradual" route, Kamalaśīla enacted ''[[phowa]]'',  transferring his [[mindstream]] to animate a corpse polluted with contagion in order to safely move the hazard it presented.  As the mindstream of Kamalaśīla was otherwise engaged, a mahasiddha named [[Dampa Sangye]] came across the vacant ''kuten'' or "physical basis" of Kamalaśīla. Dampa Sangye was not karmically blessed with an aesthetic corporeal form, and upon finding the very handsome and healthy empty body of Kamalaśīla, which he assumed to be a newly dead fresh corpse, used phowa to transfer his own mindstream into Kamalaśīla's body. Dampa Sangye's mindstream in Kamalaśīla's body continued the ascent to the Himalaya and thereby transmitted the Pacification of Suffering teachings and the Indian form of Chöd which contributed to the Mahamudra Chöd of [[Machig Labdrön]]. The mindstream of Kamalaśīla was unable to return to his own ''kuten'' and so was forced to enter the vacant body of Dampa Sangye.&lt;ref name="Thrangu, Khenchen 2007"&gt;Thrangu, Khenchen &amp; Klonk, Christoph (translator) &amp; Hollmann, Gaby (editor and annotator)(2006).

{{Algebraic structures|Module}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''module''' is one of the fundamental [[algebraic structure]]s used in [[abstract algebra]]. A '''module over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a generalization of the notion of [[vector space]] over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], wherein the corresponding [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] are the elements of an arbitrary given ring (with identity) and a multiplication (on the left and/or on the right) is defined between elements of the ring and elements of the module.

Thus, a module, like a vector space, is an additive [[abelian group]]; a product is defined between elements of the ring and elements of the module that is distributive over the addition operation of each parameter and is [[Semigroup action|compatible]] with the ring multiplication.

Modules are very closely related to the [[representation theory]] of [[group (mathematics)|group]]s. They are also one of the central notions of [[commutative algebra]] and [[homological algebra]], and are used widely in [[algebraic geometry]] and [[algebraic topology]].

== Introduction and definition ==

=== Motivation ===
In a vector space, the set of [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] and acts on the vectors by scalar multiplication, subject to certain axioms such as the [[distributive law]].  In a module, the scalars need only be a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], so the module concept represents a significant generalization.  In commutative algebra, both [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] and [[quotient ring]]s are modules, so that many arguments about ideals or quotient rings can be combined into a single argument about modules.  In non-commutative algebra the distinction between left ideals, ideals, and modules becomes more pronounced, though some ring-theoretic conditions can be expressed either about left ideals or left modules.&lt;!-- (semi)perfect rings for instance have a litany of "Foo is true for all left ideals iff foo is true for all finitely generated left ideals iff foo is true for all cyclic modules iff foo is true for all modules" --&gt;

Much of the theory of modules consists of extending as many of the desirable properties of vector spaces as possible to the realm of modules over a "[[well-behaved]]" ring, such as a [[principal ideal domain]]. However, modules can be quite a bit more complicated than vector spaces; for instance, not all modules have a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]], and even those that do, [[free module]]s, need not have a unique rank if the underlying ring does not satisfy the [[invariant basis number]] condition, unlike vector spaces, which always have a (possibly infinite) basis whose cardinality is then unique. (These last two assertions require the [[axiom of choice]] in general, but not in the case of finite-dimensional spaces, or certain well-behaved infinite-dimensional spaces such as [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; space]]s.)

=== Formal definition ===
Suppose that ''R'' is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] and 1&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is its multiplicative identity.
A '''left ''R''-module''' ''M'' consists of an  [[abelian group]] {{nowrap|(''M'', +)}} and an operation {{nowrap|⋅ : ''R'' × ''M'' → ''M''}} such that for all ''r'', ''s'' in ''R'' and ''x'', ''y'' in ''M'', we have:
#&lt;math&gt; r \cdot ( x + y ) = r \cdot x + r \cdot y &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; ( r + s ) \cdot x = r \cdot x + s \cdot x &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; ( r s ) \cdot x = r \cdot ( s \cdot x ) &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; 1_R \cdot x = x .&lt;/math&gt;

The operation of the ring on ''M'' is called ''scalar multiplication'', and is usually written by juxtaposition, i.e. as ''rx'' for ''r'' in ''R'' and ''x'' in ''M'', though here it is denoted as {{nowrap|''r'' ⋅ ''x''}} to distinguish it from the ring multiplication operation, denoted here by juxtaposition. The notation &lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' indicates a left ''R''-module ''M''. A '''right ''R''-module''' ''M'' or ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined similarly, except that the ring acts on the right; i.e., scalar multiplication takes the form {{nowrap|⋅ : ''M'' × ''R'' → ''M''}}, and the above axioms are written with scalars ''r'' and ''s'' on the right of ''x'' and ''y''.

Authors who do not require rings to be [[unital algebra|unital]] omit condition 4 above in the definition of an ''R''-module, and so would call the structures defined above "unital left ''R''-modules". In this article, consistent with the [[glossary of ring theory]], all rings and modules are assumed to be unital.&lt;ref name="DummitFoote"&gt;{{cite book | title=Abstract Algebra | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |author1=Dummit, David S.  |author2=Foote, Richard M.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | location=Hoboken, NJ | isbn=978-0-471-43334-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one writes the scalar action as ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; so that {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''r'' ⋅ ''x''}}, and ''f'' for the map that takes each ''r'' to its corresponding map ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;, then the first axiom states that every ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[endomorphism|group endomorphism]] of ''M'', and the other three axioms assert that the map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''R'' → End(''M'')}} given by {{nowrap|''r'' ↦ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}  is a [[ring homomorphism]] from ''R'' to the [[endomorphism ring]] End(''M'').&lt;ref&gt;This is the endomorphism ring of the additive group ''M''. If ''R'' is commutative, then these endomorphisms are additionally ''R'' linear.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus a module is a ring action on an abelian group (cf. [[group action]]. Also consider [[monoid action]] of multiplicative structure of ''R'').  In this sense, module theory generalizes [[representation theory]], which deals with group actions on vector spaces, or equivalently [[group ring]] actions.

A [[bimodule]] is a module that is a left module and a right module such that the two multiplications are compatible.

If ''R'' is [[commutative ring|commutative]], then left ''R''-modules are the same as right ''R''-modules and are simply called ''R''-modules.

== Examples ==

*If ''K'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], then the concepts "''K''-[[vector space]]" (a vector space over ''K'') and ''K''-module are identical.
*If ''K'' is a field, and ''K''[''x''] a univariate [[polynomial ring]], then a [[Polynomial ring#Modules|''K''[''x'']-module]] ''M'' is a ''K''-module with an additional action of ''x'' on ''M'' that commutes with the action of ''K'' on ''M''. In other words, a ''K''[''x'']-module is a ''K''-vector space ''M'' combined with a linear map from ''M'' to ''M''. Applying the [[Structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]] to this example shows the existence of the [[Rational canonical form|rational]] and [[Jordan normal form|Jordan canonical]] forms.
*The concept of a '''Z'''-module agrees with the notion of an abelian group. That is, every [[abelian group]] is a module over the ring of [[integer]]s '''Z''' in a unique way. For {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 0}}, let {{nowrap|1=''n'' ⋅ ''x'' = ''x'' + ''x'' + ... + ''x''}} (''n'' summands), {{nowrap|1=0 ⋅ ''x'' = 0}}, and {{nowrap|1=(−''n'') ⋅ ''x'' = −(''n'' ⋅ ''x'')}}. Such a module need not have a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]—groups containing [[torsion element]]s do not. (For example, in the group of integers [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 3, one cannot find even one element which satisfies the definition of a linearly independent set since when an integer such as 3 or 6 multiplies an element the result is 0. However, if a [[finite field]] is considered as a module over the same finite field taken as a ring, it is a vector space and does have a basis.)
*The [[decimal fractions]] (including negative ones) form a module over the integers. Only [[singleton (mathematics)|singletons]] are linearly independent sets, but there is no singleton that can serve as a basis, so the module has no basis and no rank.
*If ''R'' is any ring and ''n'' a [[natural number]], then the [[cartesian product]] ''R''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is both a left and a right module over ''R'' if we use the component-wise operations. Hence when {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}}, ''R'' is an ''R''-module, where the scalar multiplication is just ring multiplication. The case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 0}} yields the trivial ''R''-module {0} consisting only of its identity element. Modules of this type are called [[free module|free]] and if ''R'' has [[invariant basis number]] (e.g. any commutative ring or field) the number ''n'' is then the rank of the free module.
*If ''R'' is any ring, M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is the ring of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices over ''R'', let ''M'' be an M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'')-module, and let ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrix that has 1 in the {{nowrap|(''i'', ''i'')}}-entry, and 0 elsewhere. Then ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' is an ''R''-module, since {{nowrap|1=''re''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''m'' = ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''rm'' ∈ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}. So ''M'' breaks up as the direct sum of ''R''-modules, {{nowrap|1=''M'' = ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' ⊕ ... ⊕ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}. Conversely, given an ''R''-module ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;⊕''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is an M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'')-module. In fact, the category of ''R''-module and the category of M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'')-module are equivalent. The special case is that the module ''M'' is just ''R'' as a module over itself, then ''R''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is an M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'')-module.
*If ''S'' is a nonempty [[Set (mathematics)|set]], ''M'' is a left ''R''-module, and ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt; is the collection of all [[function (mathematics)|function]]s {{nowrap|''f'' : ''S'' → ''M''}}, then with addition and scalar multiplication in ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt; defined by {{nowrap|1=(''f'' + ''g'')(''s'') = ''f''(''s'') + ''g''(''s'')}} and {{nowrap|1=(''rf'')(''s'') = ''rf''(''s'')}}, ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt; is a left ''R''-module.  The right ''R''-module case is analogous.  In particular, if ''R'' is commutative then the collection of ''R-module homomorphisms'' {{nowrap|''h'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} (see below) is an ''R''-module (and in fact a ''submodule'' of ''N''&lt;sup&gt;''M''&lt;/sup&gt;).
*If ''X'' is a [[smooth manifold]], then the [[smooth function]]s from ''X'' to the [[real number]]s form a ring ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''X''). The set of all smooth [[vector field]]s defined on ''X'' form a module over ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''X''), and so do the [[tensor field]]s and the [[differential form]]s on ''X''.  More generally, the sections of any [[vector bundle]] form a [[projective module]] over ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''X''), and by [[Swan's theorem]], every projective module is isomorphic to the module of sections of some bundle; the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'')-modules and the category of vector bundles over ''X'' are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]].
*If ''R'' is any ring and ''I'' is any [[ring ideal|left ideal]] in ''R'', then ''I'' is a left module over ''R''. Analogously of course, right ideals are right modules.
*If ''R'' is a ring, we can define the ring ''R''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; which has the same underlying set and the same addition operation, but the opposite multiplication:  if {{nowrap|1=''ab'' = ''c''}} in ''R'', then {{nowrap|1=''ba'' = ''c''}} in ''R''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;.  Any ''left'' ''R''-module ''M'' can then be seen to be a ''right'' module over ''R''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;, and any right module over ''R'' can be considered a left module over ''R''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;.
* There are [[Glossary of Lie algebras#Representation theory|modules of a Lie algebra]] as well.

== Submodules and homomorphisms ==

Suppose ''M'' is a left ''R''-module and ''N'' is a [[subgroup]] of ''M''.  Then ''N'' is a '''submodule''' (or ''R''-submodule, to be more explicit) if, for any ''n'' in ''N'' and any ''r'' in ''R'', the product {{nowrap|''r'' ⋅ ''n''}} is in ''N'' (or {{nowrap|''n'' ⋅ ''r''}} for a right module).

The set of submodules of a given module ''M'', together with the two binary operations + and ∩, forms a [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] which satisfies the '''[[modular lattice|modular law]]''':
Given submodules ''U'', ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''M'' such that {{nowrap|''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊂ ''N''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then the following two submodules are equal: {{nowrap|1=(''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''U'') ∩ ''N''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + (''U'' ∩ ''N''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

If ''M'' and ''N'' are left ''R''-modules, then a [[map (mathematics)|map]] {{nowrap|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is a '''[[module homomorphism|homomorphism of ''R''-modules]]''' if, for any ''m'', ''n'' in ''M'' and ''r'', ''s'' in ''R'',
:&lt;math&gt;f(r \cdot m + s \cdot n) = r \cdot f(m) + s \cdot f(n)&lt;/math&gt;
This, like any [[homomorphism]] of mathematical objects, is just a mapping which preserves the structure of the objects.  Another name for a homomorphism of modules over ''R'' is an ''R''-[[linear map]].

A [[bijective]] module homomorphism is an [[isomorphism]] of modules, and the two modules are called ''isomorphic''. Two isomorphic modules are identical for all practical purposes, differing solely in the notation for their elements.

The [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of a module homomorphism {{nowrap|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is the submodule of ''M'' consisting of all elements that are sent to zero by ''f''. The [[isomorphism theorem]]s familiar from groups and vector spaces are also valid for ''R''-modules.

The left ''R''-modules, together with their module homomorphisms, form a [[category theory|category]], written as ''R''-'''Mod''' (see [[category of modules]] for more.) This is an [[abelian category]].

== Types of modules ==

'''Finitely generated.''' An ''R''-module ''M'' is [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] if there exist finitely many elements ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''M'' such that every element of ''M'' is a [[linear combination]] of those elements with coefficients from the ring ''R''.

'''Cyclic.''' A module is called a [[cyclic module]] if it is generated by one element.

'''Free.''' A [[free module|free ''R''-module]] is a module that has a basis, or equivalently, one that is isomorphic to a [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of copies of the ring ''R''. These are the modules that behave very much like vector spaces.

'''Projective.''' [[Projective module]]s are [[direct summand]]s of free modules and share many of their desirable properties.

'''Injective.''' [[Injective module]]s are defined dually to projective modules.

'''Flat.''' A module is called [[flat module|flat]] if taking the [[tensor product of modules|tensor product]] of it with any [[exact sequence]] of ''R''-modules preserves exactness.

'''Torsionless module.''' A module is called [[torsionless module|torsionless]] if it embeds into its algebraic dual.

'''Simple.''' A [[simple module]] ''S'' is a module that is not {0} and whose only submodules are {0} and ''S''.  Simple modules are sometimes called ''irreducible''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (1964), [https://books.google.com/books?id=KlMDjaJxZAkC&amp;pg=PA4 p. 4], Def. 1; {{PlanetMath|urlname=IrreducibleModule|title=Irreducible Module}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Semisimple.''' A [[semisimple module]] is a direct sum (finite or not) of simple modules.  Historically these modules are also called ''completely reducible''.

'''Indecomposable.''' An [[indecomposable module]] is a non-zero module that cannot be written as a [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of two non-zero submodules. Every simple module is indecomposable, but there are indecomposable modules which are not simple (e.g. [[uniform module]]s).

'''Faithful.''' A [[faithful module]] ''M'' is one where the action of each {{nowrap|''r'' ≠ 0}} in ''R'' on ''M'' is nontrivial (i.e. {{nowrap|''r'' ⋅ ''x'' ≠ 0}} for some ''x'' in ''M'').  Equivalently, the [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of ''M'' is the zero ideal.

'''Torsion-free.''' A [[torsion-free module]] is a module over a ring such that 0 is the only element annihilated by a regular element (non zero-divisor) of the ring.

'''Noetherian.''' A [[Noetherian module]] is a module which satisfies the [[ascending chain condition]] on submodules, that is, every increasing chain of submodules becomes stationary after finitely many steps.  Equivalently, every submodule is finitely generated.

'''Artinian.''' An [[Artinian module]] is a module which satisfies the [[descending chain condition]] on submodules, that is, every decreasing chain of submodules becomes stationary after finitely many steps.

'''Graded.''' A [[graded module]] is a module with a decomposition as a direct sum {{nowrap|1=''M'' = {{resize|140%|⨁}}&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} over a [[graded ring]] {{nowrap|1=''R'' = {{resize|140%|⨁}}&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that {{nowrap|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊂ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''x''+''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for all ''x'' and ''y''.

'''Uniform.'''  A [[uniform module]] is a module in which all pairs of nonzero submodules have nonzero intersection.

== Further notions ==

=== Relation to representation theory ===

If ''M'' is a left ''R''-module, then the ''action'' of an element ''r'' in ''R'' is defined to be the map {{nowrap|''M'' → ''M''}} that sends each ''x'' to ''rx'' (or ''xr'' in the case of a right module), and is necessarily a [[group homomorphism|group endomorphism]] of the abelian group {{nowrap|(''M'', +)}}.  The set of all group endomorphisms of ''M'' is denoted End&lt;sub&gt;'''Z'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') and forms a ring under addition and composition, and sending a ring element ''r'' of ''R'' to its action actually defines a [[ring homomorphism]] from ''R'' to End&lt;sub&gt;'''Z'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'').

Such a ring homomorphism {{nowrap|''R'' → End&lt;sub&gt;'''Z'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'')}} is called a ''representation'' of ''R'' over the abelian group ''M''; an alternative and equivalent way of defining left ''R''-modules is to say that a left ''R''-module is an abelian group ''M'' together with a representation of ''R'' over it.

A representation is called ''faithful'' if and only if the map {{nowrap|''R'' → End&lt;sub&gt;'''Z'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'')}} is [[injective]]. In terms of modules, this means that if ''r'' is an element of ''R'' such that {{nowrap|1=''rx'' = 0}} for all ''x'' in ''M'', then {{nowrap|1=''r'' = 0}}. Every abelian group is a faithful module over the [[integer]]s or over some [[modular arithmetic]] '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''.

=== Generalizations ===
Any ring ''R'' can be viewed as a [[preadditive category]] with a single object. With this understanding, a left ''R''-module is nothing but a (covariant) [[additive functor]] from ''R'' to the category '''Ab''' of abelian groups. Right ''R''-modules are contravariant additive functors. This suggests that, if ''C'' is any preadditive category, a covariant additive functor from ''C'' to '''Ab''' should be considered a generalized left module over ''C''; these functors form a [[functor category]] ''C''-'''Mod''' which is the natural generalization of the module category ''R''-'''Mod'''.

Modules over ''commutative'' rings can be generalized in a different direction: take a [[ringed space]] (''X'', O&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) and consider the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of O&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;-modules; see [[sheaf of modules]] for more. These form a category O&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;-'''Mod''', and play an important role in modern [[algebraic geometry]]. If ''X'' has only a single point, then this is a module category in the old sense over the commutative ring O&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'').

One can also consider modules over a [[semiring]]. Modules over rings are abelian groups, but modules over semirings are only [[commutative]] [[monoid]]s. Most applications of modules are still possible. In particular, for any [[semiring]] ''S'' the matrices over ''S'' form a semiring over which the tuples of elements from ''S'' are a module (in this generalized sense only). This allows a further generalization of the concept of [[vector space]] incorporating the semirings from theoretical computer science.

Over [[near-rings]], one can consider near-ring modules, a nonabelian generalization of modules.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The '''Northern Ireland civil rights movement''' dates to the early 1960s, when a number of initiatives emerged which challenged inequality and discrimination in [[Northern Ireland]]. The Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) was founded by Conn McCluskey and his wife, Patricia. Conn was a doctor, and Patricia was a social worker who had worked in Glasgow for a period, and who had a background in housing activism. Both were involved in the Homeless Citizens League, an organisation founded after Catholic women occupied disused social housing. The HCL evolved into the CSJ, focusing on lobbying, research and publicising discrimination. The [[University for Derry Committee|campaign for Derry University]] was another mid-1960s campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Purdie |first=Bob |title=Politics in the Streets: The origins of the Civil Rights Movement |year=1990 |publisher=Blackstaff Press |location=Belfast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important organisation established during this period was the [[Northern Irish Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA), established in 1967 to protest discrimination. NICRA's objectives were:

#To defend the basic freedoms of all citizens
#To protest the rights of the individual
#To highlight abuses of power
#To demand guarantees for freedom of speech, assembly and association
#To inform the public of its lawful rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Purdie |first=Bob |title=Politics in the Streets: The origins of the Civil Rights Movement |year=1990 |publisher=Blackstaff Press |location=Belfast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Anthony Coughlan and Roy Johnston were involved in the Wolfe Tone Societies (WTS), an independent adjunct to the Republican movement, Through the WTS, they advocated a campaign for civil rights in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanley and Miller|title=The Lost Revolution: The story of the Official IRA and the Workers' Party|year=2009|publisher=Penguine Ireland|location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association|NICRA]] was formed on 29 January 1967, it was predominantly made up of individuals outside the Republican movement. A thirteen-person steering committee was elected, including representatives from trade unions, the Belfast WTS, the Republican Clubs, the [[Belfast Trades Council]], the [[Republican Labour Party]], the [[Ulster Liberal Party]], the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]], the Ardoyne Tenants Association and the [[Young Unionists]]. The board included two members of the Wolfe Tone Societies and one member of the IRA (Liam McMillen, Belfast Officer Commanding at the time); Betty Sinclair (Communist Party) was the chair.

During its first two years NICRA wrote letters, petitioned and lobbied; it was "a period of general ineffectuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Purdie|1990|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1968 NICRA "somewhat hesitantly"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farrell|first=Michael|title=Northern Ireland: the Orange State|year=1976|publisher=Pluto|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; agreed to hold its first protest march from [[Coalisland]] to [[Dungannon]], on 24 August. The march was publicised as a "civil rights march", and the organisers emphasised its non-sectarian dimension. [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey|Bernadette Devlin]] (who became a civil-rights activist) described a festival atmosphere which turned "uglier" when the police stopped the march from entering Dungannon, where a counter-demonstration had been called by the [[Ian Paisley|Paisleyites]]. The NICRA organisers announced that they would not breach the police cordon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Devlin|first=Bernadette|title=The Price of My Soul|year=1969|publisher=Pan Books Ltd.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Devlin recalls, they began to "lose their hold on the marchers".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|1969|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Devlin, many of the initial organisers soon left after efforts to wind down the movement failed; those who remained "sat down in big circles all over the road and sang rebel songs till midnight".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|1969|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Derry, 5 October 1968}}Derry, 5 October 1968==
The second civil-rights march was proposed by activists on the Derry Housing Action Committee (DHAC). DHAC, founded in early 1968. It campaigned against discrimination in housing and the shortage of [[Public housing|social housing]] in [[Derry]], one of Northern Ireland’s most depressed towns. A sample of DHAC tactics is revealed in the case of John Wilson, related by Fionbarra O’Dochartaigh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Dochartaigh|first=Fionbarra|title=Ulster's White Negros: From civil rights to insurection|year=1994|publisher=Ak Press|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a leading member of the DHAC) in his book ''Ulster’s White Negros''. Wilson (a Catholic) lived with his family in a [[Travel trailer|caravan]], but was told he was unlikely to obtain social housing. On 22 June 1968 DHAC put his caravan in the middle of a main road, blocking traffic for 24&amp;nbsp;hours; the following weekend, it blocked traffic for 48&amp;nbsp;hours. After this, it planned to block the city centre when the Wilsons were provided housing. Eamonn McCann, another key member of the DHAC, described this as an important victory: "It had been made very publicly clear that outrageous tactics worked, that blocking roads worked better than an MP’s intervention…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCann|first=Eamonn|title=War and an Irish Town|year=1980|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NICRA accepted the Derry activists’ march, planned for 5 October 1968 in Derry. However, the march was banned by Minister for Home Affairs [[William Craig (Northern Ireland politician)|William Craig]] and NICRA wanted to withdraw. The march route included the city centre, a bastion of Protestantism and out-of-bounds for Catholic public events. The DHAC said they would go ahead, forcing NICRA to agree or be seen to capitulate.

{{quote|Derry is a dead city: about one in five of the men is unemployed and the whole feeling is depressed. But it was electric that day. You could see it on people’s faces - excitement, or alarm, or anger. Derry was alive.|Bernadette Devlin&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|1969|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The march was characterised by non-sectarian civil-rights demands, including an end to [[gerrymandering]] and discrimination in housing and the [[Suffrage|right to vote]]. The [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] attempted to violently disperse the crowd. When the RUC attacked, Betty Sinclair asked the crowd to disperse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Dochartaigh|first=Niall|title=From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the birth of the Irish troubles|year=1997|publisher=Cork University Press|location=Cork}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, chaos erupted as the protesters found themselves trapped between two lines of the RUC. The police drove the protesters across the river into the Catholic area of the Bogside: "By this time the original confrontation between marchers and the police had given way to a general battle between the police and young residents of the Bogside, most of whom had taken no part in the march".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Purdie|1990|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The birthdate of the civil-rights movement is considered to be 5 October; images of police brutality were broadcast worldwide, and much of Northern Ireland’s population was horrified. In Derry, the period following 5 October was one in which established political forces and prominent individuals in Catholic areas tried to harness and control the movement's energy.

After the 5 October march the DHAC radicals scheduled another march on the same route for the following week. At this point, Derry moderates emerged and announced a meeting attended by "local professionals, business people, trade unionists and clergy"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Dochartaigh|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Catholic community. This led to the formation of the Derry Citizens Action Committee (DCAC), which effectively (if temporarily) assumed leadership of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Dochartaigh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DHAC, afraid of losing influence, joined the DCAC (except for Eamonn McCann, who denounced them as "middle class, middle aged and middle of the road").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCann}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DCAC fought for civil rights with non-violent civil disobedience and direct action, now with a mainstream leadership careful to provide leadership at each action to prevent confrontations with the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Dochartaigh}}&lt;/ref&gt; DCAC continued its push for non-sectarian demands. Its first action, a mass sit-down in Derry’s Guildhall Square (home of the Derry Corporation), focused on housing and the following demands:

*Crash house-building programme
*A points system for housing allocation
*Legal control over renting furnished accommodations

The DCAC organised a series of actions, many of which defied Craig’s ban on protests and demonstrated "its ability to mount a peaceful protest and maintain discipline over its followers".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Purdie|1990|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was growing, and many of its demands seemed achievable. However, "the committee’s rank-and-file supporters were becoming increasingly militant".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Purdie|1990|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; All demonstrations in Derry were banned on 18 November, which was an initial peak in civil-rights activity (much of which was independent of the DCAC). That day, protesters who had been arrested at the 5 October march were being prosecuted. After their trial they were carried down to Guildhall Square by a large crowd of supporters, where they were attacked by the police. Thirty minutes later, about 400 dock workers left work in protest against the attacks and marched through the city centre. The DCAC had earlier cancelled a planned strike of shirt-factory workers, "but at about 3pm one thousand workers, mostly young women from some half dozen factories, left work and marched up Strand Road, through Guildhall Square…to the Diamond".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Purdie|1990|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Days later, Prime Minister Terrance O’Neill began to concede to the movement's demands. On 22 November O’Neill announced the dissolution of Derry Corporation, the end of the company director’s vote, and a points system to end housing discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Dochartaigh}}&lt;/ref&gt; O’Neill made a television address appealing to the civil-rights movement to "give him time" to introduce reforms. Consequently, the DCAC called a truce and announced that it would not organise any more marches for one month.

=={{anchor|The People’s Democracy}}People's Democracy==
In Belfast the situation was different, since students at Queen’s University (QUB) were at the centre of events. Bernadette Devlin, leader of the People's Democracy (PD) and a foremost figure in the civil-rights movement, described her return to QUB after the Derry march:

{{quote|I went up to Belfast thinking I had changed, and I found that everyone had. The atmosphere at Queen’s was jolttingly different. The silence barrier was down. Derry was being talked about in the lecture rooms, in the tutorial rooms, in the snackbar at dinner, in the cloakrooms, in the showers, in the bar…People were talking and thinking about the society they were living in - not as an intellectual exercise, but enthusiastically and emotionally and as if it mattered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|1969|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 9 October, Devlin and others organized a protest march to Belfast City Hall against police brutality: "2,000 people turned up spontaneously. All the complacent attitudes were gone".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|1969|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this protest, the students returned to campus and held a meeting at which the PD was formed with six demands: one man, one vote; a fair drawing of electoral boundaries; freedom of speech and assembly; repeal of the Special Powers Act; and a fair allocation of jobs and social housing. "One man, one vote" would become a central demand of the movement. The PD would become a leading force within the movement between late 1968 and the first part of 1969; it was committed to street politics and staunchly anti-sectarian.

The PD was organised through a democratic mass assembly. Michael Farrell, the most influential figure in the PD, has said that they were influenced by the radical democratic practices of the Sorbonne Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baxter, L., Devlin, B., Farrell, M., McCann, E., &amp; Toman, C|title=People's Democracy: a discussion on strategy|journal=New Left Review|year=1969|issue=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PD elected a "Faceless Committee" to execute decisions made by the assembly. While there was no formal membership, Devlin remembers up to 700 people attending their mass assemblies. PD actions in late 1968 included protests, open-air meetings, [[Sit-in|sit-downs]] and the occupation of the Northern Ireland Parliament on 24 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arthur|first=Paul|title=The People's Democracy, 1968-1973|year=1974|publisher=Blackstaff Press|location=Belfast}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In January 1969, the PD organised a "Long March" from Belfast to Derry modelled on the civil-rights march to Montgomery, Alabama. This was during the "truce", which NICRA and DCAC were maintaining. The march was criticised as "reckless", with the DCAC and NICRA opposing it. The purpose of the march was described by one activist as "pushing a structure…towards a point where its internal proceedings would cause a snapping and breaking to begin",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arthur|1974|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Devlin described it as an attempt to "pull the carpet off the floor to show the dirt that was underneath".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|1969|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The march was attacked repeatedly along the way, but as it developed it drew more supporters and participants. By marching through "Protestant territory" (where it was repeatedly blocked and threatened), the Long March exposed Northern Irish sectarianism and the unwillingness of police to defend the right to protest.

As they neared Derry, at Burntollet Bridge, the marchers were ambushed by [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] and members of the RUC. Eighty-seven activists were hospitalised. When the marchers reached Derry, the city exploded in riots. Following a night of rioting, RUC men entered the Bogside (a Catholic [[Ghetto#Northern Ireland|ghetto]]), wrecked a number of houses and attacked several people. This led to a new development: Bogside residents, with the consent of the DCAC, set up "vigilante" groups to defend the area. Barricades were put up and manned by the locals for five days. It also created a context in which older Republican veterans could emerge as prominent figures within the movement; for example, Sean Keenan (later important to the Derry Provisional IRA) was involved in pushing for defensive patrols and barricades.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Dochartaigh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first half of 1969 continued to be characterised by protests and direct action. The PD had joined NICRA ''en masse'' and succeeded in radicalising the organisation, with a number of PD members gaining seats on the executive board. NICRA organised marches and demonstrations throughout Northern Ireland, and the DCAC called off its truce and began organising marches again. The government introduced more-repressive legislation (specifically banning civil-disobedience tactics such as sit-ins), which gave the movement something else to resist. In April there were more serious riots in Derry, and the barricades went up again for a brief period. Meanwhile, direct action around concrete issues continued; according to Devlin, in the first half of 1969 the activists around Eamonn McCann "housed more families [via squatting] than all the respectable housing bodies in Derry put together".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|1969|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1969 Prime Minister Terence O'Neill resigned and was replaced by [[James Chichester-Clark]], who announced the introduction of "one man, one vote"; the civil-rights movement had achieved its key demand. However, additional demands concerned police violence and state repression. Two of the most prominent issues were the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]], which gave nearly-indiscriminate power to the state (including internment without trial) and the [[Ulster Special Constabulary|B-Specials]], a part-time auxiliary police force seen as sectarian and made up exclusively of Protestants.

=={{anchor|The Battle of the Bogside}}Battle of the Bogside==
The next development during this period was the "Battle of the Bogside", in which confrontation with the police would reach a peak in Derry’s most militant Catholic ghetto. The first half of 1969 was an intense period of political conflict, of which Derry was the epicentre. On 12 August an [[Apprentice Boys of Derry]] parade was scheduled to take place in Derry; it would pass near the [[Bogside]] area, spawning fears it would erupt into a sectarian bloodbath. Activists in Derry made provisions to limit this possibility by building barricades along the route and providing stewards. Activist Eamonn McCann worried about sectarian conflict usurping the civil-rights emphasis of the movement. In a leaflet he circulated shortly before the event, McCann notes that despite the civil-rights movement’s non-sectarian intentions:

{{quote|In Derry we have finished up participating in the “Defence Association” locking ourselves inside the Catholic area. Probably it is necessary. One must make some attempt to avoid a Catholic versus Protestant fight. And in the situation in which we find ourselves there seems to be no other way of doing it…But that doesn’t mean that we like it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCann|first=Eamonn|title=Who's wrecking the civil rights movement?|year=1969|location=Derry|url=http://cedarlounge.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/emc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Defence Association cited by McCann was the Derry Citizens’ Defence Association, set up before 12 August and largely promoted by Republicans. During the next few months the DCDA became the dominant organisation in Derry, displacing the DCAC.

On 12 August, confrontation erupted. Some have argued that the Bogsiders were provoked by loyalists,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others suggest that Catholic youths stoned the Apprentice Boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Dochartaigh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riots soon began, and the RUC clubbed the Bogsiders. The barricades went up but the RUC were determined to take them down, despite the probability of a huge confrontation. After an initial retreat, the Bogsiders began to force the RUC back. The DCDA had prepared well; the barricades were effective, and rocks and [[Molotov cocktail|petrol bombs]] had been prepared. What followed was a 50-hour confrontation, in which the entire population of the Bogside was mobilised: women and children made and distributed petrol bombs while others, stationed on [[tower block]] roofs, kept the police at bay with them. Exhausted, the RUC withdrew but the government called in the B-Specials to take over the fight. As they prepared to enter, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] decided to send in British army troops. The troops moved in between the barricades and the RUC, preventing any further conflict without interfering with the barricades.

During the three-day Battle of the Bogside, the civil-rights movement became a localised insurrection against the state. When the RUC retreated and the British army respected the barricades, there was a sense of victory. Bernadette Devlin (who took part) recalled:

{{quote|We reached then a turning point in Irish history, and we reached it because of the determination of one group of people in a Catholic slum area in Derry. In fifty hours we brought a government to its knees, and we gave back to a downtrodden people their pride and the strength of their convictions."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|1969|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the following month, "Free Derry" (as it became known) "was surrounded by barricades... and was administered by the DCDA, in constant negotiation with the local British army commanders. In the process, the DCDA displaced the political authority of the local MP, John Hume, and of all the political parties".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Dochartaigh|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DCDA had forty-four members (including nine older Republicans) who would later become members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]; younger, radical-leftist Republicans; Northern Irish Labour Party activists; the Young Socialist Alliance; tenants' associations and moderate activists who followed [[John Hume]]. The Bogsiders declared that the barricades would come down under the following conditions: the abolition of Stormont; abolition of the B-Specials; abolition of the Special Powers Act and the disarming of the RUC.

In early August 1969, RUC and loyalist forces attacked Catholic areas in west Belfast; barricades were erected, behind which "Free Belfast" was born. As in Derry, the Belfast experiment was organised internally by a Citizens Defence Committee. The demands launched from the barricades echoed those of Derry: disband the B-Specials; disarm the RUC and amnesty for internees.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arthur|1974|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free Belfast shared many characteristics of its Derry counterpart, although Republicans had a stronger influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arthur|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of "free" areas in Belfast and Derry was, in many ways, the final phase of the civil-rights movement. The intervention of British troops and the related increase in state repression were key factors.

The concluding events of the civil-rights movement were complex. The relationship between the British army and the Catholic population deteriorated quickly, and confrontations became more frequent. Civil disobedience and street politics became increasingly unstable. Many activists were imprisoned based on false testimony, and the army announced it would shoot rioters. Loyalist forces became increasingly active, planting a number of bombs in 1969 and blaming them on the IRA. The situation was becoming militarised; in this context, the IRA could assume a leading role.

Near the end of 1969 there was change within the IRA itself. Many older "traditionalists" had again become active, advocating military action to defend Catholic areas (a strategy resisted by the left-leaning leadership, who favoured social and political agitation over military action). At the end of 1969 the IRA divided, and the Provisional IRA emerged. In early 1970 it undertook its first actions (including the armed defence of St. Mathew’s church in the Short Strand, which loyalists were attempting to burn). Between 1970 and 1972 the Provisional IRA became more active in rioting and targeting British soldiers. In 1971, internment without trial was introduced. In response NICRA (which, due to the emergence of the Provisional IRA and the PD’s drift towards socialist-party politics, was the main organisation advocating civil rights) organised a campaign of non-payment of rates and rent, in which an estimated 30,000 households participated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association|title='We Shall Overcome': The history of the struggle for civil rights in Northern Ireland, 1968-1978|year=1979|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/nicra/nicra78.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such attempts to continue civil disobedience, the civil-rights movement floundered during 1971 and 1972. In January 1972 British soldiers attacked a peaceful demonstration, killing 13 civilians in what became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|"Bloody Sunday"]]. NICRA organised a protest in response, in which over 100,000 people took part. This was, however, to be the organisation's last significant march;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Northern Irish Civil Rights Association|title='We Shall Overcome': The history of the struggle for civil rights in Northern Ireland, 1968-1978.|year=1979|pages=38|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/nicra/nicra78.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloody Sunday had "immobilised NICRA from returning to the streets".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association|1979|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; As clashes escalated, London suspended the Northern Ireland parliament. This marked the end of the civil-rights movement and street politics. The Provisional IRA emerged as the dominant force within the movement, and Irish nationalism became the foremost political position for those seeking radical social change.

'''Oceanic dispersal''' is a type of [[biological dispersal]] that occurs when terrestrial organisms transfer from one land mass to another by way of a sea crossing. Often this occurs via large rafts of floating vegetation such as are sometimes seen floating down major rivers in the tropics and washing out to sea, occasionally with animals trapped on them.&lt;ref name=Mittermeier&gt;{{cite book | last = Mittermeier | first = R.A. | authorlink = Russell Mittermeier | title = Lemurs of Madagascar | edition = 2nd | publisher = Conservation International | year = 2006 | pages = 24–26 | isbn=1-881173-88-7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dispersal via such a raft is sometimes referred to as a "rafting event".

Colonization of land masses by plants can also occur via long-distance oceanic dispersal of floating seeds.&lt;ref name="Won2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Won | first1 = H. | last2 = Renner | first2 = S.

==History==
Rafting has played an important role in the colonization of isolated land masses by mammals. Prominent examples include [[Madagascar]], which has been isolated for ~120 million years ([[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]), and [[South America]], which was isolated for much of the [[Cenozoic]]. Both land masses, for example, appear to have received their [[primate]]s by this mechanism. According to genetic evidence, the common ancestor of the [[lemur]]s of [[Madagascar]] appears to have crossed the [[Mozambique Channel]] by rafting between 50 and 60 Ma ago.&lt;ref name=Roos&gt;{{cite journal | first = Christian | last = Roos |author2=Schmitz, Jürgen |author3=Zischler, Hans | title = Primate jumping genes elucidate strepsirrhine phylogeny | journal = PNAS | date = July 2004 | volume = 101 | pages = 10650–10654 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/101/29/10650.full.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0403852101 | pmid = 15249661 | issue = 29 | pmc = 489989 | bibcode=2004PNAS..10110650R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sellers&gt;{{cite web | url = http://homepage.mac.com/wis/Personal/lectures/human-origins/PrimateEvolution.pdf | title = Primate Evolution | accessdate = 2008-10-23 | last = Sellers | first = Bill | date = 2000-10-20 | format = PDF | publisher = [[University of Edinburgh]] | pages = 13–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ali&amp;Huber"&gt;{{Cite journal

Colonization of groups of islands can occur by an [[Iteration|iterative]] rafting process sometimes called [[island hopping]]. Such a process appears to have played a role, for example, in the colonization of the [[Caribbean]] by [[Mammals of the Caribbean|mammals of South American origin]] (including caviomorphs and monkeys).&lt;ref name = "Hedges2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3417/0026-6493(2006)93[231:POTAAO]2.0.CO;2| title = Paleogeography of the Antilles and Origin of West Indian Terrestrial Vertebrates1| journal = [[Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden]]| volume = 93| issue = 2| pages = 231–244| year = 2006| last1 = Hedges | first1 = S.

DNA sequence analysis suggests that ancestors of the genus dispersed from southern South America to South Africa about 10 million years (Ma) ago, where the most [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] clade is found; subsequent rafting events then took the genus eastward with the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] to Australia, then to New Zealand and finally to Chile by about 2 Ma ago.&lt;ref name="Kuntner2016" /&gt; Another example among spiders is the species ''[[Moggridgea rainbowi]]'', the only Australian member of a genus otherwise endemic to Africa, with a divergence date of 2 to 16 Ma ago.&lt;ref name="Kuntner2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuntner|first1=M.|last2=Harrison|first2=S.

However, oceanic dispersal of terrestrial species may not always take the form of rafting; in some cases, swimming or simply floating may suffice. Tortoises of the genus ''[[Chelonoidis]]'' arrived in South America from Africa in the Oligocene;&lt;ref name = "Le et al."&gt;{{cite journal

The dispersal of [[anthracothere]]s from Asia to Africa about 40 Ma ago,&lt;ref name = "Chaimanee"/&gt; and the much more recent dispersal of [[hippopotamus|hippo]]s (relatives and probably descendants of anthracotheres) from Africa to Madagascar may have occurred by floating or swimming.&lt;ref name = "Ali&amp;Huber"/&gt;

==Observation==
The first documented example of colonization of a land mass by rafting occurred in the aftermath of hurricanes [[Hurricane Luis|Luis]] and [[Hurricane Marilyn|Marilyn]] in the [[Caribbean]] in 1995. A raft of uprooted trees carrying fifteen or more [[green iguana]]s was observed by fishermen landing on the east side of [[Anguilla]] – an island where they had never before been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=E.|date=1998-10-15|title=Iguanas ride the waves|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/news981015-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iguanas had apparently been caught on the trees and rafted two hundred miles across the ocean from [[Guadeloupe]], where they are indigenous.&lt;ref name="Censky1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Censky|first1=E.

The advent of human civilization has created opportunities for organisms to raft on floating artifacts, which may be more durable than natural floating objects. This phenomenon was noted following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Tōhoku tsunami]] in Japan, with about 300 species found to have been carried on debris by the [[North Pacific Current]] to the west coast of North America (although no colonizations have been detected thus far).&lt;ref name="Chown2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Chown|first1=S.

The song is remarkable for its impartial, egalitarian lyrics, which extols the soldiers' love and duty to the motherland without explicit reference to any particular race or religion.

''Perajurit Tanah Air'' found renewed popularity among Malaysians in the wake of the [[2013 Lahad Datu standoff]].

'''Radical Unintelligibility''', a term coined by [[Bernard Lonergan]], is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] idea that we can act against our better judgment. We can refuse to choose what we know is worth choosing. It is the refusal to make a decision that one deems one ought to make.  [[Mortal sin]] is radically unintelligible: when we commit a mortal sin, we fully consent to do something despite knowing that it is wrong to do it.

'''ReadyBoost''' (codenamed '''EMD'''&lt;ref name="FeatureNames"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ianm/archive/2006/04/06/569715.aspx |title=SuperFetch, ReadyBoost and ReadyDrive: some new feature names for you |last=Moulster |first=Ian |date=April 6, 2006 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |work=MSDN Blogs |accessdate=July 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[cache (computing)|disk caching]] software component developed by [[Microsoft]] for [[Windows Vista]] and included in later versions of the [[Windows (operating system)|Windows]] [[operating system]]. ReadyBoost enables [[flash memory|NAND memory]] [[mass storage]] devices, including [[CompactFlash]], [[Secure Digital card|SD card]]s, and [[USB flash drive]]s, to be used as a [[cache (computing)|write cache]] between a [[hard drive]] and [[random access memory]] in an effort to increase computing performance. ReadyBoost relies on the [[Windows Vista I/O technologies#SuperFetch|SuperFetch]] technology and, like SuperFetch, adjusts its cache based on user activity. Other features, including [[Windows Vista I/O technologies#ReadyDrive|ReadyDrive]], are implemented in a manner similar to ReadyBoost.&lt;ref name="KernelChanges"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/f/d/afdfd50d-6eb9-425e-84e1-b4085a80e34e/SYS-T512_WH07.pptx |title=Windows Vista Kernel Changes |last=Russinovich |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Russinovich |date=2007 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912235324/http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/f/d/afdfd50d-6eb9-425e-84e1-b4085a80e34e/SYS-T512_WH07.pptx |archivedate=September 12, 2007 |format=PPTX |accessdate=July 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Using ReadyBoost-capable flash memory ([[NAND flash|NAND memory]] devices) for caching allows [[Windows Vista]] and later to service random disk reads with better performance than without the cache. This caching applies to all disk content, not just the page file or system DLLs. Flash devices typically are slower than a mechanical hard disk for sequential I/O, so, to maximize performance, ReadyBoost includes logic that recognizes large, sequential read requests and has the hard disk service these requests.&lt;ref name="QnA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/tomarcher/archive/2006/06/02/615199.aspx |title=ReadyBoost Q&amp;A |accessdate=2008-01-11 |last=Archer |first=Tom |author2=Ayers, Matt  |date=2006-06-02 |work=Tom Archer's Blog |publisher=[[MSDN Blogs]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a compatible device is plugged in, the Windows [[AutoPlay]] dialog offers an additional option to use the flash drive to speed up the system; an additional '''ReadyBoost''' tab is added to the drive's properties dialog where the amount of space to be used can be configured.&lt;ref name="readyboostJim Allchin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/tomarcher/archive/2006/04/14/576548.aspx |title=ReadyBoost - Using Your USB Key to Speed Up Windows Vista |date=April 14, 2006 |accessdate=2006-05-21 |author=Tom Archer |work=Tom Archer's Blog |publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum cache size is 250&amp;nbsp;MB. In Vista or with FAT32 formatting of the drive, the maximum is 4&amp;nbsp;GB. In Windows 7 with NTFS or exFAT formatting, the maximum cache size is 32&amp;nbsp;GB per device. Windows Vista allows only one device to be used, while Windows 7 allows multiple caches, one per device, up to a total of 256&amp;nbsp;GB.&lt;ref name="readyboostMarius Oiaga"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-7-RTM-ReadyBoost-256-GB-of-Memory-Cache-Support-124081.shtml |title=Windows 7 RTM ReadyBoost 256 GB of Memory Cache Support |date=October 12, 2009 |accessdate=2013-01-09 |author=Marius Oiaga |work=SOFTPEDIA |publisher=SoftNews NET SRL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ReadyBoost compresses and encrypts all data that is placed on the flash device with [[AES-128]]; Microsoft has stated that a 2:1 compression ratio is typical, so a 4&amp;nbsp;GB cache would usually contain 8&amp;nbsp;GB of data.&lt;ref name="russinovich"&gt;{{cite web

== Requirements ==
For a device to be compatible and useful, it must conform to these requirements:
* The removable media's capacity must be at least 256&amp;nbsp;MB&lt;ref name=understand /&gt; (250&amp;nbsp;MB after formatting, [[Windows 7]] reports in its Event Log a required minimum of 235&amp;nbsp;MB).
* [[Windows 7]] allows up to eight devices for a maximum of 256&amp;nbsp;GB of additional memory,&lt;ref name="readyboostwin7"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/readyboost
|title=Windows 7 features - ReadyBoost - Microsoft Windows
|author=Microsoft Windows
|accessdate=2009-09-22
}}&lt;/ref&gt; with up to 32&amp;nbsp;GB on a single storage device.&lt;ref name="speed-up-your-computer"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-memory-in-your-storage-device-to-speed-up-your-computer
|title=Using memory in your storage device to speed up your computer
|author=Microsoft Windows
|accessdate=2012-01-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The device must have an access time of 1&amp;nbsp;ms or less.
* The device must be capable of 2.5&amp;nbsp;MB/s read speeds for 4&amp;nbsp;kB random reads spread uniformly across the entire device, and 1.75&amp;nbsp;MB/s write speeds for 512&amp;nbsp;kB random writes spread uniformly across the device.&lt;ref name="is-your-flash-drive-fast-enough"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/is-your-flash-drive-fast-enough-for-vistas-readyboost/186
|title=Is your flash drive fast enough for Vista's ReadyBoost?
|author=Ed Bott, ZDNet
|accessdate=2012-01-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Microsoft Windows Client Performance group recommends a flash-memory-to-system-RAM ratio of between 1:1 and 2.5:1.&lt;ref name="QnA" /&gt;

Other considerations:
* Vista's ReadyBoost supports [[NTFS]], [[File Allocation Table|FAT16, and FAT32]] from SP1 onwards.  [[Windows 7]] also supports the newer [[exFAT]] file system.  As the ReadyBoost cache is stored as a file, the flash drive must be formatted as FAT32, NTFS, or exFAT in order to have a cache size greater than FAT16's 2&amp;nbsp;GB filesize limit; if the desired cache size is 4&amp;nbsp;GB (the FAT32 filesize limit) or larger, the drive must be formatted as NTFS or exFAT.  The performance differences between these file systems are negligible with ReadyBoost.
* The initial release of ReadyBoost for Windows Vista supported one device. Windows 7 supports multiple flash drives for ReadyBoost, so performance improvement similar to [[RAID#Standard levels|RAID&amp;nbsp;0]] can be expected.
* The ReadyBoost algorithm was improved in Windows 7, resulting in better performance. One experiment showed reading of flash memory up to 5–10 times faster than Windows Vista due to higher hit rate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}
* Because ReadyBoost stores its cache as a file on the root directory of the drive rather than using the flash memory without a file system, the file system must be [[Mount (computing)|mounted]] and [[Drive letter assignment|assigned a drive letter]]. The ReadyBoost cache is created on the [[Root directory#Multiple root directories|root directory]] of the drive.

== Performance ==
A system with 512&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM (the minimum requirement for Windows Vista) can see significant gains from ReadyBoost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anandtech.com/systems/showdoc.aspx?i=2917&amp;p=5 AnandTech: Windows Vista Performance Guide&lt;!-- reflinks title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmid, Patrick. [http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/windows-vista-superfetch-and-readyboostanalyzed,1532-6.html "Windows Vista's SuperFetch and ReadyBoost Analyzed:] Conclusion." Toms Hardware. 2007-01-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In one test case, adding 1&amp;nbsp;GB of ReadyBoost memory sped up an operation from 11.7 seconds to 2 seconds. However, increasing the physical memory (RAM) from 512&amp;nbsp;MB to 1&amp;nbsp;GB (without ReadyBoost) reduced it to 0.8 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anandtech.com/systems/showdoc.aspx?i=2917&amp;p=6 AnandTech: Windows Vista Performance Guide&lt;!-- reflinks title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; System performance with ReadyBoost can be monitored by Windows Performance Monitor.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Greg. [http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/window-on-windows/keep-tabs-on-readyboost-with-windows-7s-performance-monitor/2257 "Keep tabs on ReadyBoost with Windows 7's Performance Monitor."] ''TechRepublic.'' 2010-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt; As the price of RAM decreased and more RAM was installed in computers, the mitigations provided by ReadyBoost to systems with insufficient memory decreased.

The core idea of ReadyBoost is that a [[flash memory]] (e.g. a [[USB flash drive]] or an [[Solid-state drive|SSD]]) have a much faster seek time than a typical magnetic hard disk (less than 1&amp;nbsp;ms), allowing it to satisfy requests faster than reading files from the hard disk. It also leverages the inherent advantage of two parallel sources from which to read data, whereas Windows 7 enables the use of up to eight flash drives at once, allowing up to nine parallel sources. [[Universal Serial Bus#USB 2.0|USB 2.0]] flash drives are slower for ''sequential'' reads and writes than modern desktop hard drives. Desktop hard drives can sustain anywhere from 2 to 10 times the transfer speed of USB 2.0 flash drives but are equal to or slower than [[USB 3.0]] and [[IEEE 1394 interface|Firewire (IEEE 1394)]] for sequential data. USB 2.0 and faster flash drives have faster ''random access'' times: typically around 1&amp;nbsp;ms, compared to 12&amp;nbsp;ms for mainstream desktop hard drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = June 2010 | url = http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=140 | title = WD Scorpio Blue Mobile: Drive Specifications | publisher = [[Western Digital]] | accessdate = 15 January 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110105162632/http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=140 | archivedate = 5 January 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- High-cost ($500-$20,000) solid state mass storage currently has random sustained external throughput up to 3&amp;nbsp;GB/s (TMS RamSan) and latency as low as 0.003 ms (Violin 1010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storagesearch.com/ssd-fastest.html the Fastest Solid State Disks (SSDs) 1.8&amp;quot;, 2.5&amp;quot; to 3U]&lt;/ref&gt;
 --&gt;
On [[laptop]] computers, the performance shifts more in favor of flash memory when laptop memory is more expensive than desktop memory; many laptops also have relatively slow 4200&amp;nbsp;rpm and 5400&amp;nbsp;rpm hard drives.

In versions of Vista prior to SP1, ReadyBoost failed to recognize its cache data upon resume from sleep, and restarted the caching process, making ReadyBoost ineffective on machines undergoing frequent sleep/wake cycles. This problem was fixed in Vista SP1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istartedsomething.com/20070709/vista-sp1-readyboost-bug/ Vista SP1 will fix critical ReadyBoost performance bug&lt;!-- reflinks title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations==
Since flash drives wear out after a finite (though very large) number of writes, ReadyBoost will eventually wear out the drive it uses. According to the Microsoft Windows Client Performance group, the drive should be able to operate for at least ten years.&lt;ref name="QnA" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9794">{{About|the common term "real life"|things named "Real Life"|Real Life (disambiguation){{!}}Real Life}}

'''"Real life"''' is a phrase used originally in literature to distinguish between the '''real world''' and fictional or idealized worlds, and in [[acting]] to distinguish between performers and the characters they portray. More recently, it has become a popular term on the [[Internet]] to describe events, people, activities, and interactions occurring offline; or otherwise not primarily through the medium of the Internet.  It is also used as a metaphor to distinguish life in a vocational setting as opposed to an academic one.

==As distinct from fiction==
[[File:BlakeStories1 (cropped).png|thumb|upright|Illustration by [[William Blake]] for Wollstonecraft's ''Original Stories'' (1791)]]
When used to distinguish from fictional worlds or [[fictional universe|universe]]s against the [[consensus reality]] of the reader, the term has a long history:
{{quote|Authors, as a rule, attempt to select and portray types rarely met with in their entirety, but these types are nevertheless more real than real life itself.|[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]|''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]''&lt;ref name=Dostoyevsky&gt;{{cite web |title=Fyodor Dostoyevsky: The Idiot: Part IV: Chapter I |work=The Free Online Library |url= http://dostoyevsky.thefreelibrary.com/The-Idiot/4-1#real+life |accessdate=2006-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In her 1788 work, ''[[Original Stories from Real Life; with Conversations Calculated to Regulate the Affections, and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness]]'', author [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] employs the term in her title, representing the work's focus on a middle-class ethos which she viewed as superior to the court culture represented by [[fairy tales]] and the values of chance and [[luck]] found in [[chapbook]] stories for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, Mary. Original Stories from Real Life. London: Printed for Joseph Johnson, 1788. Available from Eighteenth Century Collections Online. (by subscription only) Retrieved on 13 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As phrased by Gary Kelly, writing about the work, "The phrase ‘real life’ strengthens ‘original’, excluding both the artificial and the fictional or imaginary."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Gary. ''Revolutionary Feminism: The Mind and Career of Mary Wollstonecraft''. London: Macmillan, 1992. {{ISBN|0-312-12904-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the phrase can be used to distinguish an [[actor]] from a character, e.g. "In real life, he has a British accent" or "In real life, he lives in Los Angeles."

There is a related but slightly distinct usage among [[live action role playing|role-players]] and [[historical reenactment|historical reenactors]], to distinguish the fantasy or historical context from the actual world and the role-player or actor from the character, e.g. "What do you do in real life?" or "Where do you live in real life?"

== As distinct from the Internet ==
On the Internet, "real life" refers to life [[Online and offline|offline]]. Online, the [[initialism]] "IRL" stands for "in real life", with the meaning "not on the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?String=exact&amp;Acronym=IRL|title=AcronymFinder.com search for IRL}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, while Internet users may speak of having  "met" someone that they have contacted via [[online chat]] or in an [[online game|online gaming]] context, to say that they met someone "in real life" is to say that they literally encountered them at a physical location. Some, arguing that the Internet is part of real life, prefer to use "away from the keyboard" ([[wikt:AFK|AFK]]), e.g. the documentary ''[[TPB AFK]]''.

Some [[Sociology|sociologists]] engaged in the study of the Internet have predicted that someday, a distinction between online and offline worlds may seem "quaint", noting that certain types of online activity, such as sexual intrigues, have already made a full transition to complete legitimacy and "reality".&lt;ref name="Slater"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of New Media: Social Shaping and Consequences of ICTs|date=2002|publisher=Sage Publications Inc|isbn=0-7619-6510-6|pages=533–543|chapter=Social Relationships and Identity On-line and Off-line|editor=Leah Lievrouw and Sonia Livingstone|author=Don Slater}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related terminology===

The [[initialism]] "RL" stands for "real life" and "IRL" for "in real life." For example, one can speak of "meeting IRL" someone whom one has met online, such as in "LMIRL" ("let's meet in real life"). It may also be used to express an inability to use the Internet for a time due to "RL problems". Some internet users use the [[idiom]]s "[[face time]]", "meatspace", or "meat world", which contrast with the term "[[cyberspace]]".&lt;ref name="WordSpy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/meatspace.asp|title=meatspace (MEET.spays) n.|date=1996-11-14|publisher=Paul McFedries and Logophilia Limited|accessdate=2008-08-11|work=Word Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thephoenix.com/article_ektid17440.aspx|title=Does your life suck?|last=Dodero|first=Camille|date=17 July 2006|publisher=''[[The Phoenix (magazine)|The Phoenix]]''|quote=Beyond this world, in real life — a/k/a what Second Lifers refer to as "meatspace," where your body is made of flesh, not bytes…|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Meatspace" has appeared in the ''[[Financial Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d0f71fb6-3243-11db-ab06-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=4e612cca-6707-11da-a650-0000779e2340,print=yes.html|title=Warning: interruption overload|date=2006-08-23|publisher=Ft.com|author=Rhymer Rigby|accessdate=2011-10-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813224049/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d0f71fb6-3243-11db-ab06-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=4e612cca-6707-11da-a650-0000779e2340,print=yes.html|archivedate=13 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[science fiction]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;For example:

&lt;/ref&gt; Some early uses of the term include a post to the [[Usenet newsgroup]] austin.public-net in 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/austin.public-net/browse_thread/thread/ab22c492a3319c44/798af58d879feba0?q=meatspace&amp;_done=%2Fgroups%3Fq%3Dmeatspace%26start%3D0%26scoring%3Dd%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26ie%3DUTF-8%26lr%3D%26as_qdr%3D%26as_drrb%3Db%26as_mind%3D31%26as_minm%3D1%26as_miny%3D1981%26as_maxd%3D2%26as_maxm%3D3%26as_maxy%3D1996%26safe%3Doff%26&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+Search&amp;&amp;d#798af58d879feba0|title=Austin CyberSpace Journal #1|last=Barnes|first=Douglas|date=21 February 1993|quote=Meatspace update (quick rundown on where/how to interact with net.folks in meatspace, i.e., regular events, social gatherings, restaurant hangouts, etc.)|accessdate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an article in ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' about [[John Perry Barlow]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2149736&amp;date=19951030&amp;query=meatspace|title=He's Trying To Build A Community On-Line -- Grateful Dead Lyricist Ventures Into Cyberspace|last=Andrews|first=Paul|date=30 October 1995|work=The Seattle Times|quote=John Perry Barlow is multitasking between cyberspace, meatspace and parentspace about as well as a mere mortal can do.|accessdate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term entered the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=36770|title='Lookist' Britain: the way we look inspires the new English|accessdate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As distinct from the academic world==
The phrase is also used to distinguish [[academia|academic life]] from work in other sectors, in a manner similar to the term "real world". A person with experience in "real life" or the "real world" has experience beyond book-learning.  It may also be used, often pejoratively, to distinguish other insular [[Subculture|subcultures]], work environments, or [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] from more traditional social and professional activities. The terms "real life" and "the real world" may also be used to describe [[adulthood]] and the adult world as distinct from [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1126">"'''Recept'''" (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|ˌ|s|ɛ|p|t}}) is a term used in the work of 19th-century [[Psychology|psychologist]] [[George Romanes]] to refer to an idea that is formed by the repetition of [[percept]]s (i.e., successive percepts of the same object).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Webster's New International Dictionary |year=1913 |publisher=G. &amp; C. Merriam |location=Springfield, Massachusetts |page=1781}} "A mental image or idea formed by successive percepts of the same or like objects, and thus accentuating their common characters; a generic image."&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is similar to that of concatenated impressions, as seen in the work of [[David Hume]]. 

The term is used in [[Richard Maurice Bucke]]'s book, ''Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind''. Bucke was a 19th-century  [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]].

'''Robert Black''' (21 April 1947 – 12 January 2016) was a Scottish [[serial killer]] and [[paedophile]] who was convicted of the [[kidnap]], [[rape]], [[sexual assault]] and [[murder]] of four girls aged between 5 and 11 in a series of killings committed between 1981 and 1986 in the United Kingdom.

Black was convicted of the kidnapping, rape and murder of three girls on 19 May 1994. He was also convicted of the kidnapping of a fourth girl, and had earlier been convicted of the kidnapping and sexual assault of a fifth. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 35 years.

Black was further convicted of the 1981 sexual assault and murder of nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy in 2011, and at the time of his death was regarded as the prime suspect in the 1978 disappearance and murder of 13-year-old [[Disappearance of Genette Tate|Genette Tate]]. Black may also have been responsible for several other unsolved child murders throughout Britain, Ireland and [[continental Europe]] between 1969 and 1987.

The nationwide [[manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] for Black was one of the most exhaustive UK murder investigations of the 20th century. He died in prison in 2016.&lt;!-- PER WP:LEADCITE ALL THIS IS CITED IN THE BODY --&gt;

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Robert Black was born in [[Grangemouth]], [[Stirlingshire]], on 21 April 1947, the [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] child of Jessie Hunter Black and an unknown father. His mother originally planned to have him adopted before she emigrated to Australia to escape the stigma of his birth.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=131}} He was not adopted,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=23}} and at six months old was placed with an experienced, middle-aged [[foster care|foster couple]] in [[Kinlochleven]] named Tulip. He adopted their surname.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|pp=11–13}}

Black showed antisocial tendencies{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=23}} and became known as an aggressive child with few friends.&lt;ref name ="tough"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tough-wee-boy-turned-killer-1437311.html|title='Tough wee boy' turned killer|access-date=15 July 2016|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=19 May 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was prone to tantrums and vandalised school property. He was also a target for bullying among children his own age, and became a bully towards younger children. Though his foster mother insisted upon cleanliness, he cared little for his own hygiene and was called "Smelly Bobby Tulip" by classmates.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13039109.Predator_with_a_grotesque_history_of_abuse/|title=Predator with a grotesque history of abuse|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=28 October 2011|access-date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of five, Black and a girl the same age compared their [[genitalia]], triggering a childhood belief within Black that he should have been born female,{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=13}} and he developed a deep interest in his genitalia, the genitals of female children, and [[body orifice]]s. From the age of eight he would regularly insert objects in his own anus, a practice he carried into adulthood.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=24}}

Locals later recalled seeing bruises on Black's face and limbs, suggesting he had been physically abused by his foster parents. Black stated he could not recollect their origin, and they may have resulted from childhood fights.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=15}} Despite being adamant he could not recall the origin of these bruises, Black was a [[Nocturnal enuresis|chronic bed wetter]], and freely admitted to being berated and beaten by his foster mother for each offence.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=15}}

By 1958 the Tulips had both died, and he was placed with another foster family in Kinlochleven. He soon committed his first known sexual assault, dragging a young girl into a public lavatory and fondling her.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2365}} His foster mother reported the offence and insisted he be removed from her home.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=24–25}}

===Adolescence===
Black was placed in a mixed-sex children's home on the outskirts of [[Falkirk]]. Here he regularly exposed himself to girls, and on one occasion, he forcibly removed the underwear of a girl.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=25}} As a result, he was sent to Red House Care Home, a high-discipline, all-male establishment in [[Musselburgh]]. At this new location Black was sexually abused by a male staff member&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; for three years; typically by being forced to perform [[fellatio]]. During this time he studied at [[Musselburgh Grammar School]], developing an interest in football and swimming. Other students recall him as taciturn, with few friends.

In 1963, Black left the Red House Care Home. With assistance from child welfare agencies, he moved to another boys' home in [[Greenock]] and obtained a job as a butcher's delivery boy. He later said that he had fondled thirty to forty young girls while making deliveries if, upon calling at the house, he discovered young girls were alone in the premises.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=26}} None of these incidents seem to have been reported.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=25}}

==First conviction==
On a summer evening in 1963, Black encountered a seven-year-old girl playing alone in a park; he lured the child to a deserted [[air-raid shelter]] on the pretext of showing her some kittens. There he held the girl by the throat until she lost consciousness, then masturbated over her body.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=19}} The following day, Black was arrested and charged with lewd and libidinous behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8852899/Robert-Black-guilty-of-fourth-child-murder-the-victims.html/|title=Robert Black guilty of fourth child murder: the victims|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=27 October 2011|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mental status examination|psychiatric examination]] suggested the incident was an isolated one, and that Black was not in need of treatment;{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=27}} as a result he was [[admonition|admonished]] for the offence.

Shortly after, Black moved to Grangemouth, where he lodged with an elderly couple and worked for a builders' supply company. He began dating a young woman he met at a local youth club. This was his only known girlfriend,{{sfnp|Wyre|Tate|1995|p=60}} and they dated for several months. According to Black, he had asked this woman to marry him, and was devastated when she abruptly ended their relationship, in part due to his unusual sexual demands.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=27}}

In 1966 Black's landlords discovered he had molested their nine-year-old granddaughter whenever she visited their household. They evicted him but did not inform police, wanting to spare their granddaughter further trauma.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=21}} Black lost his job soon after, and he returned to Kinlochleven, where he lodged with a married couple who had a six-year-old daughter.

===Borstal sentence===
Within a year, Black's new landlords informed police that he had repeatedly molested their daughter. He pleaded guilty to three counts of [[indecent assault]] against a child. He was sentenced to a year at Polmont [[Borstal]] in [[Brightons]], which specialised in training and [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitating]] of serious youthful offenders. Although he later spoke freely about every aspect of his youth and adolescence—including the sexual abuse he had suffered at the Red House Care Home—he refused to discuss Polmont Borstal beyond saying he had vowed to never again be imprisoned; this has led to speculation that he may have been brutalised there.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=22}}

==Relocation to London==
In September 1968, six months after his release from Polmont Borstal,&lt;ref name ="tough"/&gt; Black moved to [[London]], where he initially found lodgings in a [[bedsit]] close to [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]]. Between 1968 and 1970, he supported himself through various—often casual—jobs.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=30}} One of these was as a [[lifeguard]] at a [[Hornsey]] swimming pool, where he was soon fired for fondling a young girl; no charges were brought.

Via a contact he had met at a King's Cross bookshop,{{sfnp|Wyre|Tate|1995|p=47}} Black began to collect [[child pornography]].{{sfnp|Wyre|Tate|1995|p=47}} Initially, much of this material was in magazine and photograph format, although he later expanded this material to include videos depicting graphic [[child sexual abuse]]. As Black was a keen [[photographer]], he sometimes also discreetly photographed children (mostly girls between eight and twelve)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15339312|title=Robert Black trial: Jury hears defendant spied on young girls|work=BBC News|date=17 October 2011|access-date=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=161}}{{sfnp|Wilson|2007|p=156}} at locations such as swimming pools; he stored these images alongside his pornographic material in locked suitcases.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=30}}

Black frequented the Three Crowns, a [[Stamford Hill]] pub, where he became known as a proficient darts player. There he also met a Scottish couple, Edward and Kathy Rayson. In 1972, he moved into their attic. The Raysons considered Black a responsible if somewhat reclusive tenant who gave them no cause for complaint beyond his poor hygiene. They suspected Black of viewing pornographic material, but had no idea it might be paedophilic. Black remained their lodger until his arrest in 1990.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=160–161}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tough-wee-boy-turned-killer-1437311.html|title='Tough Wee Boy' Turned Killer|access-date=13 May 2017|newspaper=The Independent|date=19 May 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-distance driving employment===
To increase his scope for casual work, in the mid-1970s Black bought a white [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] van to enable him to commit to driving for a living.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2363}} In 1976, Black obtained a permanent job as a van driver for Poster, Dispatch and Storage Ltd,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=32}} a [[Hoxton]]-based firm whose fleet delivered posters—typically depicting pop stars—and billboard advertisements to locations across the UK, Ireland and continental Europe. To his employers, Black was a conscientious employee who was willing to undertake the long-distance deliveries some of his married co-workers disliked.

While working as a driver, Black developed a thorough knowledge of much of the UK road network, subsequently enabling him to snatch children across the entire country and dispose of their bodies hundreds of miles from the site of their abduction.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2371}} To reduce the chance of being identified by eyewitnesses, Black often adjusted his appearance by alternately growing a beard or appearing clean-shaven, and occasionally shaved his head completely bald. Black also owned over a dozen pairs of spectacles, and would wear a pair significantly different from those he regularly wore when abducting children.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2367}} He also covered the rear windows of his van with opaque black curtains.

==First murders==

===Jennifer Cardy===
The first murder Black is proven to have committed was that of nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy, who was abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered on 12 August 1981.&lt;ref name="Belfast Telegraph 27 October 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/tragic-jennifer-cardys-final-few-hours-28674140.html|title=Tragic Jennifer Cardy's final few hours|newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|date=27 October 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardy was last seen by her mother at 1:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. as she cycled to a friend's house in [[Ballinderry, County Antrim]]; she never arrived.

Hours later, Cardy's bicycle was discovered less than a mile from her home, covered with branches and leaves. The stand of the bicycle was down, suggesting that she had stopped her bicycle to converse with her abductor.&lt;ref name="Belfast Telegraph 27 October 2011"/&gt; A search aided by 200 volunteers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19810818&amp;id=c6MyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0e4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1278,4355118&amp;hl=en|title=Search for lost girl unites Irish|newspaper=The Citizen, Ottawa|date=19 August 1981|access-date=6 July 2016|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; found nothing further.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=10}}

Six days later, hunters discovered Cardy's body {{convert|16|mi|km}} from her home, in a reservoir near a [[Rest area#Lay-bys|lay-by]] in [[Hillsborough, County Down|Hillsborough]].&lt;ref name=BBCOct2011/&gt; A pathologist noted signs of sexual abuse on Cardy's body and underwear;&lt;ref name="The Irish Times 11 October 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/man-on-trial-over-ni-girl-s-murder-1.885065|title=Man on trial over NI girl's murder|newspaper=Irish Times|date=11 October 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the autopsy concluded she had died of [[drowning]]—most likely accompanied by [[ligature strangulation]].&lt;ref name="The Irish Times 11 October 2011"/&gt; The watch she had been wearing had stopped at 5:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="Ulster Star"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lisburn.com/archives/info/news-2011/jennnifer-cardy3.html|title=Accused is a convicted child killer, jury is told|newspaper=Ulster Star|date=2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the body near a major arterial road between [[Belfast]] and [[Dublin]] led police to suspect her murderer had been familiar with the area. The reservoir she had been found in was near a route frequented by long-distance delivery drivers,&lt;ref name="Herald1981"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19810819&amp;id=eO5AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lKcMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3576,3493677&amp;hl=en|title=Missing Ulster girl found murdered|newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Glasgow Herald]]|date=19 August 1981|access-date=6 July 2016|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the killer may have travelled extensively.&lt;ref name="Herald1981"/&gt;
[[File:The road to Cornhill - geograph.org.uk - 1195591.jpg|thumb|right|The [[A697 road|A697]] towards [[Cornhill-on-Tweed]]. Black is believed to have abducted Susan Maxwell as she walked along this road on 30 July 1982]]

===Susan Maxwell===
Black's second confirmed victim was 11-year-old Susan Claire Maxwell, who lived in [[Cornhill-on-Tweed]] on the English side of the [[Anglo-Scottish border]]. Maxwell was abducted on 30 July 1982 as she walked home from playing tennis in [[Coldstream]]. She was last seen alive at 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.,{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=34}} crossing the bridge over the [[River Tweed]], and was likely abducted by Black shortly after.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2363}}

The following day a search was mounted. [[Search and rescue dog|Search dogs]] were used, and at peak 300 officers were assigned full-time; a thorough search was made of every property in both Cornhill and Coldstream and over 80 square miles of terrain. Several people reported having seen a white van in the locality; one said a van had been parked in a field gateway off the [[A697 road|A697]].{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=49}}

On 12 August, Maxwell's body was found by a lorry driver; her body was covered with [[undergrowth]], and was clothed save for her shoes and underwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/susan-maxwell-seen-alone-before-disappearance-triple-murder-trial-told-of-surprise-at-sighting-1370277.html|title=Susan Maxwell 'seen alone before disappearance': Triple murder trial told of surprise at sighting|access-date=27 October 2011|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=16 April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise date and cause of her death could not be determined due to decomposition. Maxwell had been bound, and gagged with sticking plaster, and her underwear had been removed and  folded beneath her head, suggesting that she had been sexually assaulted.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=34}}

A [[coroner#inquest|coroner's inquest]] concluded Maxwell had died shortly after being abducted.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=59}} Evidently, Maxwell remained in Black's van—alive or dead—for over 24 hours,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=37}} as his delivery schedule encompassed [[Edinburgh]], [[Dundee]], and finally [[Glasgow]], where he made his final delivery close to midnight on 30 July. The following day, Black returned from Glasgow to London, discarding the body in a [[thicket|copse]] beside the [[A518 road]] near [[Uttoxeter]], {{convert|264|mi|km}} from where Maxwell had been abducted.{{refn|group=n|One of Black's colleagues suspected Black might have been involved in Maxwell's abduction and murder. When this colleague quizzed Black as to his whereabouts on the day concerned, Black claimed he had not been near the [[Anglo-Scottish border]]. This employee did not relay his concerns to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tough-wee-boy-turned-killer-1437311.html/|title='Tough Wee Boy' Turned Killer|newspaper=The Independent|date=19 May 1994|access-date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Caroline Hogg===
Five-year-old Caroline Hogg, Black's youngest known victim, disappeared while playing outside her Beach Lane home in the Edinburgh suburb of [[Portobello, Edinburgh|Portobello]] in the early evening of 8 July 1983.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph 27 October 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8852899/Robert-Black-guilty-of-fourth-child-murder-the-victims.html|title=Robert Black guilty of fourth child murder: the victims|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]|date=27 October 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she failed to return home by 7:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., her family searched the surrounding streets. A boy told them he had seen Caroline with a man on the nearby [[esplanade|promenade]], which they searched before calling [[Lothian and Borders Police]].{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2366}}

The ensuing search was the largest in Scottish history at that time,{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=44}} with 2,000 local volunteers and 50 members of the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]]{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=68}} searching first Portobello, then expanding their scope to all of Edinburgh. By 10 July, Hogg's disappearance was headline news across the UK. Nine known paedophiles were identified as having been in Portobello on 8 July; all were eliminated from the inquiry.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=77}}

Numerous eyewitnesses had seen an unkempt, balding, "furtive-looking" man wearing horn-rimmed glasses, watching Hogg as she played; then following her to a nearby fairground. En route, a 14-year-old girl named Jennifer Booth had seen Hogg sitting with this man on a bench. Booth overheard Hogg reply "Yes please" to some question posed to her by the man before the two walked to the fairground holding hands.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=40}}
There, the man paid for Caroline to ride a carousel as he watched. A witness stated to police that as they left, Caroline seemed frightened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12672447.Caroline_apos_s_last_15p_fairground_ride_Trial_told_how_police_took_an_hour_to_respond_to__apos_scruffy_man_apos__alert/|title=Caroline's last 15p fairground ride Trial told how police took an hour to respond to 'scruffy man' alert|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=22 April 1994|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogg remained in Black's van for at least 24 hours. Black delivered posters to Glasgow several hours after the abduction, and refuelled his van in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] early the following morning.

On 18 July, Hogg's naked body was found in a ditch close to the [[M1 motorway]] in [[Twycross]],&lt;ref name="The Telegraph 27 October 2011"/&gt; {{convert|310|mi|km}} from where she had been abducted and just {{convert|24|mi|km}} from where Maxwell's body had been found the previous year.
The precise cause of death could not be determined due to the extent of decomposition. Insect activity suggested the body had been placed where it was found on or after 12 July; Black had made a delivery to [[Bedworth]] on that date. The absence of clothing again suggested a sexual motive.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|pp=45–46}}

The following March, a televised reconstruction of the abduction was broadcast nationally. Appealing for witnesses to come forward, Hogg's father said: "You think it can never happen to you, but it has proven time and time again that it can, and it could again if this man isn't caught in the near future."&lt;ref&gt;''True Crime'' August 1994 p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coordinated task force==
After the discovery of Hogg's body, a conference of senior Staffordshire and Leicestershire detectives unanimously concluded that Hogg's and Maxwell's murderers were the same person, to a large degree because of the distance between the abduction and discovery sites.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=62}} (Cardy's murder was not linked to this series until 2009.&lt;ref name="BBCNews16December2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8415233.stm |title=Robert Black charged with 1981 Jennifer Cardy murder|work=BBC News |date=16 December 2009|accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Due to the distances involved, police suspected that the murderer of Maxwell and Hogg worked as a lorry or van driver, or a sales representative,{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2366}} which required him to travel extensively to locations which included the [[Scottish Borders]]. Both girls had been bound and likely subjected to a sexual assault prior to the murders, and each had been wearing white ankle socks at the time of her abduction, which may have triggered a [[sexual fetishism|fetish]] in the perpetrator's [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]].{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2363}} Due to the geographical and [[circumstantial evidence|circumstantial]] nature of the offences, the killer was most likely an [[opportunism|opportunist]].

Based upon the day of the week when Maxwell and Hogg had been abducted (a Friday), the killer was likely tied to a delivery or production schedule. Following the August 1982 discovery of Maxwell's body, numerous transport firms with links between Scotland and [[the Midlands]] of England were contacted, and drivers were questioned about their whereabouts on the date of her abduction. This line of inquiry was repeated following the discovery of Hogg's body, but in both instances failed to yield results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19870501&amp;id=3Co1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=u6ULAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3315,4144&amp;hl=en|title=Police question man, 37, over three girls' deaths|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=1 May 1987|access-date=6 July 2016|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite frustration at the lack of a breakthrough in their search for the murderer, there was complete cooperation between the detectives from the four police forces involved in the manhunt. Initially, a satellite incident room in Coldstream coordinated the efforts of the forces involved in the hunt for Maxwell's killer, with incident rooms in Leith and Portobello coordinating the search for Hogg's; within hours of Hogg's body being discovered, the [[chief constable]]s of all forces now involved in investigating the murders agreed to appoint a senior investigating officer to coordinate the inquiries.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=70}} Hector Clark, the [[assistant chief constable]] of Northumbria Police, took overall charge of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19830723&amp;id=QsNAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A6YMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3135,4468691&amp;hl=en|title=Double murder hunt police chief pledges no Ripper-type mistakes|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=23 July 1983|access-date=10 July 2016|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark established incident rooms in [[Northumberland]] and Leith police stations, to liaise between the four police forces involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McEwen|first=Alan|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/caroline-hogg-murder-city-scarred-30-years-on-1-2992923|title=Caroline Hogg murder: City scarred 30 years on|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=8 July 2013|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HOLMES database===
All information relating to both child murders was initially logged within a [[index card|card filing system]], which contained 500,000 index cards relating to the Maxwell case alone.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=60}} Mindful of the criticisms of the recent investigation into the [[Yorkshire Ripper]], which had become overwhelmed due to the volume of information filed in a card filing system,{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|pp=46–47}} one of Clark's first decisions upon taking overall charge of the murder investigation was to introduce computer technology into the investigation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19830722&amp;id=QcNAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A6YMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5177,4192307&amp;hl=en|title=Police chief picked to head murder hunt task force|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=22 July 1983|access-date=10 July 2016|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; he and other senior officers agreed that the most efficient way to cooperate in an investigation of this scope was to collate their information on the Hogg murder into a computerised database, which all forces involved in the manhunt could access. Information relating to Maxwell's murder was also later entered onto this database.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=47}}

By January 1987, all information relating to the murders initially linked to Black was entered into the newly established [[HOLMES 2|HOLMES]] information technology system, with the £250,000 cost to implement it provided by the [[Home Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19870107&amp;id=VaNAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=k6UMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5606,799754&amp;hl=en|title=Computer to link child killer hunt|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=7 January 1987|access-date=6 July 2016|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information continued to be entered into the database, and police forces nationwide could cross-check all data fed into this system.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=83–84}} This database—based at the Child Murder Bureau in [[City of Bradford|Bradford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19880122&amp;id=XTpAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UlkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4513,4457637&amp;hl=en/|title=Police seek man freed in death probe|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=22 January 1988|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;—expanded to hold information upon over 189,000 people, 220,000 vehicles, and details of interviews held with over 60,000 people. Much of the information came through three confidential [[hotline]]s established in 1984. As a result of the investigation into the killings, several unrelated crimes, including offences relating to child abuse, were solved.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=90}}

[[File:Brunswick Place - Clough Street - geograph.org.uk - 1499664.jpg|thumb|right|Brunswick Place, [[Morley, West Yorkshire|Morley]]. Sarah Harper is believed to have been abducted from one of the alleyways leading to this street on 26 March 1986]]

===Sarah Harper===
At about 7:50&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 26 March 1986, 10-year-old Sarah Jayne Harper disappeared from the Leeds suburb of [[Morley, West Yorkshire|Morley]], having left her home to buy a loaf of bread from a [[convenience store|corner shop]] 100 yards from her home. The owner of the shop confirmed that Harper had bought a loaf of bread and two packets of crisps from her at 7:55&amp;nbsp;p.m., and that a balding man had briefly entered the shop moments later, then left as Harper made her purchases.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=86}}

Sarah Harper was last seen alive by two girls walking into an alley leading towards her Brunswick Place home; when she had not returned by 8:20&amp;nbsp;p.m., her mother, Jackie, and younger sister, Claire, briefly searched the surrounding streets, before Jackie Harper reported her daughter missing to [[West Yorkshire Police]].{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=52}} Immediately, an extensive search was launched to find the child. Over 100 police officers were assigned full-time to the search, which saw house-to-house inquiries across Morley, over 3,000 properties searched, more than 10,000 leaflets distributed, and 1,400 witness statements obtained. A police search of the surrounding land was bolstered by 200 local volunteers, and a reservoir in nearby [[Tingley]] was searched by [[underwater search and recovery|underwater units]].{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=88}}

Extensive inquiries by West Yorkshire Police established that a white [[Ford Transit]] van had been in the area where Harper had been abducted. Two suspicious men had been seen loitering near the route Harper would have taken to the corner shop, and one of them was stocky and balding. Mindful of the possibility Harper had been abducted and murdered, West Yorkshire Police dispatched a [[telex]] to all forces nationwide, requesting that they search all locations where they had previously discovered child murder victims.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=89}}

At a [[news conference|press conference]] on 3 April, Sarah's mother, Jackie, informed journalists that she feared her daughter was dead, and that the worst torment she and her family endured was the uncertainty. She made a direct appeal to her daughter's abductor to reveal the whereabouts of the body.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=91}} On 19 April, a man discovered Sarah's partially dressed, gagged and bound body floating in the [[River Trent]] near [[Nottingham]], {{convert|71|mi|km}} from the site of her abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19880118&amp;id=DA41AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=o6ULAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3636,3381206&amp;hl=en|title=New lead in child murders inquiry|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=18 January 1988|access-date=6 July 2016|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy showed she had died between five and eight hours after her she was last seen alive,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=158}} and that the cause of her death was drowning; injuries she had received to her face, forehead, head and neck had most likely rendered her [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] prior to being thrown into the water.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=142}}&lt;ref name="Ulster Star"/&gt; Harper had also been the victim of a violent and sustained sexual assault prior to being thrown into the river, causing [[pre-mortem]] internal injuries which were described by the pathologist as "simply terrible".{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=54}}

Days after Harper's body had been found, a further witness contacted West Yorkshire Police to say that at approximately 9:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 26 March, he had seen a white van with a stocky, balding man standing by the passenger door, parked close to the [[River Soar]]. As the Soar is a [[tributary]] to the Trent, and the description of the vehicle and driver matched those obtained from Morley residents, investigators took this eyewitness account seriously.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=44}} Black refuelled his van in [[Newport Pagnell]] the following afternoon, and it is likely that he had driven Harper to [[Ratcliffe on Soar]], and discarded her body in the Soar in the late evening of the date of her abduction, or the early hours of the following day.{{sfnp|Wilson|2007|p=159}}

Realising the likelihood that Harper's murderer had travelled on the M1 motorway prior to disposing of her body in the river,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=97}} and that he would have had to refuel his vehicle as he made this journey, officers from both West Yorkshire and [[Nottinghamshire Police]] questioned staff and motorists at all service stations on the M1 motorway between [[Woolley, West Yorkshire]] and [[Trowell]], Nottinghamshire, asking whether they had noted anything unusual on 26 or 27 March. Staff at one station had noted a white Transit van which had seemed out of place on the evening of 26 March, but could not give a clear description of the driver.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=54}}

==Link to series==
Detective John Stainthorpe, head of the Leeds South Division of West Yorkshire Police,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/calendar/update/2016-02-15/detective-who-helped-to-track-down-yorkshire-ripper-dies-aged-83/|title=Detective who helped to track down Yorkshire Ripper dies aged 83|publisher=ITV|date=15 February 2016|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially stated his doubt that Harper's disappearance was linked to those of Maxwell and Hogg: in one interview, he said that although he would not discount the possibility, he believed that Harper's abductor had close, personal connections with Morley.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=94}} Upon the discovery of her body in the River Trent, he revised his opinion.

Numerous similarities linked the murder of Sarah Harper to those of Maxwell and Hogg: she had been a [[preadolescence|prepubescent]], [[white people|white]] female, abducted from [[Northern England]] and found murdered in the Midlands. All three victims had been discovered within {{convert|26|mi}} of [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]],&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pithers |first=Malcolm |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/killing-of-girls-every-parents-nightmare-man-denies-abduction-and-murder-of-three-young-girls-in-1369851.html|title=Killing of girls 'every parent's nightmare': Man denies abduction and murder of three young girls in 'Midlands triangle'|date=13 April 1994|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with little effort being made to conceal the bodies.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=67}}

Despite these similarities, several investigators initially doubted whether Harper's murder should be linked to the series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19860422&amp;id=e7VAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uqUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4237,5382456&amp;hl=en|title= US-style profile on child murders|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=22 April 1986|access-date=6 July 2016|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the differences in the circumstances of her abduction and the fact that the child had been subjected to a serious sexual assault prior to her murder, whereas decomposition had erased any such clear traces on the bodies of the two previous victims. Harper had been abducted on a rainy Wednesday evening from a suburb in the north of England, wearing a hooded anorak covering much of her face, as opposed to being abducted on a summer Friday afternoon in southern Scotland while wearing summer clothing.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=87–88}} Investigators remained open-minded as to whether Harper's murder had been committed by the same person, and telephone and computer connections were established between the incident room in the Leeds district of [[Holbeck]] and Leith. Harper's murder was formally linked to the series in November 1986.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=88}}

===National manhunt===
Following the murder of Sarah Harper, with six police forces now involved in the hunt for the offender, the police forces involved in the manhunt agreed that Hector Clark (by this time Detective Chief Constable of Lothian and Borders Police) should maintain overall command of the investigation. Clark created a new headquarters in [[City of Wakefield|Wakefield]] to act as a liaison between the six forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12696731.Endless_searching_with_a_single_aim_in_mind/|title=Endless searching with a single aim in mind|access-date=26 July 2016|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=20 May 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 April 1986, the head of [[Scotland Yard]]'s [[SO11|Criminal Intelligence Branch]], Phillip Corbett, hosted a [[summit (meeting)|summit meeting]] at Scotland Yard, to discuss how best to share information between the forces involved in the manhunt, and to investigate potential links with 19 other unsolved child murders.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2368}} Senior officers attended from 16 UK police forces. At this stage, the inquiry had cost in excess of a million pounds.
{{quote box
| quote = "The abduction of this victim from a public area within walking distance of the victim's residence represents a desperate act by a man whose need for little children is greater than his fear of being exposed as a paedophile.

| source = Section of the 1988 [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[offender profiling|psychological profile]] of Robert Black, pertaining to the abduction of Caroline Hogg.
| width = 35em
}}
One of the outcomes of this meeting was that investigators contacted the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to request that they compose a [[offender profiling|psychological profile]] of the murderer for UK investigators. The FBI completed this profile in early 1988.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=96}}

For the HOLMES database, investigators concluded only those with convictions for serious sexual offences against children would warrant further investigation. Those to be checked were to have been convicted of child murder, child abduction or attempted child abduction, or the indecent assault of a child. Every police force in the UK was asked to check their databases for people who had received convictions for any of these offences within 10 years of the 1982 murder of Susan Maxwell.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2368}} This narrowed the number of people to be checked to 40,000 men, and Black's name was not on the list, as his sole conviction had been in 1967.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=98}}

In January 1988, the UK investigators received the psychological profile of the killer from the FBI. This profile described the killer as a white male aged between 30 and 40 (likely closer to 40), who was a classic loner. This offender would be unkempt in appearance,&lt;ref name="True Crime August 1994 p. 14"&gt;''True Crime'' August 1994 p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; and had received less than 12 years of formal education. He likely lived alone, in rented accommodation, in a [[lower-middle class]] neighbourhood. This profile also deduced that the motive for the child killings was sexual, that the offender held a fixation with child pornography, that he retained souvenirs from his victims, and he most likely engaged in [[necrophilia]] with his victims' bodies shortly after their death, before disposing of them.&lt;ref name="heraldscotland.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Lucy|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13039112.The_lost_chance_to_stop_killer_Black_30_years_ago/|title=The lost chance to stop killer Black 30 years ago|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=28 October 2011 |access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teresa Thornhill===
On 23 April 1988, an attempted abduction of a teenage girl occurred in the Nottingham district of [[Radford, Nottingham|Radford]] which was not initially deemed by Nottinghamshire Police to be linked to the three child killings,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=102}} and thus remained unreported to Clark or senior investigators in the national manhunt, despite the fact that all chief constables across the UK had been requested to report incidents of this nature to the inquiry team. The victim of this attempted abduction was Teresa Thornhill, a 15-year-old who was {{nowrap|4 ft 11 in (150 cm)}} tall, which may have led Black to think she was younger than she was.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=80}}

That evening, Thornhill had been at a social gathering in a local park with her boyfriend, Andrew Beeston, and other teenagers, before walking home with Beeston. The pair had parted company at the end of Norton Street when Thornhill noted a blue Transit van slowing to a stop ahead of her; the driver of this van then got out, raised the van's [[hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] and asked Thornhill, "Can you fix engines?"{{sfnp|Wyre|Tate|1995|pp=116–117}} When Thornhill replied that she could not and began walking at a much brisker pace, Black clasped his arms across her mouth and navel and attempted to drag her into his vehicle.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=79}}

Thornhill resisted him: writhing and kicking as she attempted to free herself from what she later described as his "[[bear hug]]" grasping of her body. As her would-be abductor wrestled her to his van, Thornhill squeezed his testicles, causing him to loosen his grasp sufficiently enough for her to bite into his right forearm. Black shouted, "Oh! You... bitch!", as Thornhill began to scream for her mother, wedging her feet on each side of the door frame as she struggled to resist being forced into the van.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph 27 October 2011"/&gt; At the same time, Beeston ran towards the van shouting, "Let go of her, you fat bastard!" Upon hearing this, Black loosened his grip on Thornhill, who fell into the road, sobbing. Black got into the driver's seat of the van and drove off.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=100–101}}

Both Thornhill and Beeston ran to Thornhill's home and informed her parents what had occurred; they immediately reported the attempted abduction to Nottinghamshire Police, who questioned both youngsters. Both Thornhill and Beeston described her would-be abductor as an unkempt,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=101}} overweight, balding and heavily built man aged between 40 and 50, and about {{nowrap|5 ft 7 in (175 cm)}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/attempt-to-kidnap-girl-thwarted-after-fight-woman-tells-murder-trial-of-ordeal-1372687.html|title='Attempt to kidnap girl thwarted after fight': Woman tells murder trial of ordeal|access-date=15 July 2016|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=26 April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture==
Black was arrested in [[Stow, Scottish Borders|Stow]] on 14 July 1990. David Herkes, a 53-year-old retired postmaster, was mowing his front garden when he saw a blue Transit van slow to a standstill across the road. The driver exited the van—ostensibly to clean his windscreen—as the six-year-old daughter of Herkes' neighbour passed his field of view. As Herkes stooped to clear cuttings from his lawnmower, he saw the girl's feet lifting from the pavement; he then straightened himself to observe the vehicle's driver hastily pushing something through the passenger door before clambering across to the driver's seat, closing the passenger door, and starting the engine.&lt;ref name="southern reporter"&gt;{{cite news|last=Burgess|first=Bob|url=http://www.thesouthernreporter.co.uk/news/local-headlines/gardener-who-helped-capture-evil-black-1-2561536|title=Gardener who helped capture evil Black|newspaper=Southern Reporter|date=6 October 2012|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realising he had witnessed an abduction, Herkes noted the [[vehicle registration plate|registration number]] of the van as it sped away.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2368}} Herkes ran to the girl's home; the girl's mother called police.&lt;ref name="Belfast Telegraph 12 January 2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/robert-black-one-wrong-turn-led-to-child-killer-being-caught-redhanded-34358943.html|title=Robert Black: One wrong turn led to child killer being caught red-handed|newspaper=Belfast Telegraph|date=12 January 2016|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within minutes, six police vehicles had arrived in the village.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=107}} As Herkes described the van to officers, he observed it driving in their direction and exclaimed, "That's him! That's the same van!"{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=62}} An officer jumped in the van's path, forcing it to halt. Police removed the driver from his seat and handcuffed him.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2370}}

One of the officers, who was the father of the abducted girl,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=107}} opened the rear of the van and clambered inside, calling his daughter's name.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=107}} Seeing movement in a sleeping bag,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hudson|first1=Nick|title=Child killer Robert Black was About to be Charged with 1978 Genette Tate Murder|url=https://www.policeprofessional.com/news/child-killer-robert-black-was-%C2%91about-to-be-charged%C2%92-with-1978-genette-tate-murder/|accessdate=23 October 2018|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} he untied its drawstring to discover his daughter inside, her wrists bound behind her back, her legs tied together, her mouth bound and gagged with sticking plaster, and a hood tied over her head.&lt;ref&gt;''British Serial Killers'' {{ISBN|978-1-467-88139-5}} pp. 348-349&lt;/ref&gt;

En route to [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]] police station, Black said: "It was a rush of blood to the head; I have always liked little girls since I was a lad. I tied her up because I wanted to keep her until I had dropped a parcel off. I was going to let her go." Black claimed he had interfered with his victim only "a little".{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=63}} A doctor found the victim had been subjected to a serious sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Belfast Telegraph 12 January 2016"/&gt;

The girl was able to pinpoint the lay-by on the [[A7 road (Great Britain)|A7]] where Black had sexually assaulted her. Black's intention had been to quickly make a final scheduled delivery to [[Galashiels]] before further abusing and almost certainly killing his victim.&lt;ref name="Belfast Telegraph 12 January 2016"/&gt;

===Investigation and charges===
At Selkirk police station, Black admitted to sexually assaulting the girl, saying he had not done more to her because he "didn't have much time".{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=162}} Black was charged with [[child abduction|plagium]], and held on [[remand (detention)|remand]]. As Black awaited a scheduled 16 July Selkirk Sheriff court appearance, the detective superintendent—noting the similarities between the Stow abduction and the three child killings—notified Hector Clark of Black's arrest. On 16 July, Clark travelled from Wakefield to interview Black at Edinburgh's St Leonards police station. Although Black's answers in this brief interview were largely monosyllabic, Clark left feeling that Black was the man he had sought since 1982.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=109–110}} At Black's initial remand hearing he was ordered to stand trial at [[High Court of Justiciary|Edinburgh High Court]] for the abduction of the Stow girl; he was then transferred to [[HM Prison Edinburgh|Saughton Prison]].{{sfnp|Wyre|Tate|1995|p=108}}

A search of Black's van found restraining devices including assorted ropes, sticking plaster, and hoods; a [[Instant camera|Polaroid camera]]; numerous articles of girls' clothing; a mattress; and a selection of sexual aids.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=111}} Black claimed that on his long-distance deliveries he would pull into a lay-by and dress in the children's clothing before masturbating; he gave no plausible explanation for the sexual aids.{{refn|group=n|None of the girls' clothing found in Black's van had belonged to any of the murder victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15353002|title=Robert Black trial: Defendant had 'tape and rags'|work=BBC News|date=18 October 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Black's Stamford Hill lodgings were searched at the request of Scottish detectives, yielding a large collection of child pornography in magazine, book, photographic and video format,&lt;ref name="independent19May1994"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pithers|first=Malcolm|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/killer-faces-questions-on-more-sex-murders-police-to-interview-robert-black-about-the-deaths-of-at-1437309.html|title=Killer faces questions on more sex murders: Police to interview Robert Black about the deaths of at least 12 girls in England, Northern Ireland and France|date=19 May 1994|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 58 videos and films depicting graphic child sexual abuse which Black later claimed to have bought in continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13039109.Predator_with_a_grotesque_history_of_abuse/|title=Predator with a grotesque history of abuse|access-date=16 July 2016|newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)]]|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also found were several items of children's clothing, a semen-stained copy of a Nottingham newspaper detailing the 1988 attempted abduction of Teresa Thornhill, and a variety of sex aids.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=110–111}}

Black's appointed defence lawyer, Herbert Kerrigan [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], and the Edinburgh [[procurator fiscal]] both ordered psychiatric evaluations of Black, which were undertaken by prominent psychiatrists. Both reports were uncompromising regarding Black's [[deviance (sociology)|deviancy]] and proclivities towards children.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=112}} Black told Kerrigan he intended to plead guilty to the abduction charges.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=110}}

==Abduction trial==
On 10 August 1990, Black was tried for the abduction and sexual assault of the Stow schoolgirl. He was tried at the Edinburgh High Court before [[Donald Ross, Lord Ross|Lord Donald MacArthur Ross]]. The trial lasted one day.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=112–113}}

In his [[opening statement]], Kerrigan stated his client would plead guilty to all charges. The [[Lord Advocate]] of Scotland, [[Peter Fraser, Baron Fraser of Carmyllie|Lord Fraser of Carmyllie]] QC then outlined the facts of the case, terming the implements found in Black's van a clear sign of [[malice aforethought|premeditation]], and citing a medical expert's testimony that the girl would likely have suffocated within 15 minutes had she not been rescued.&lt;ref name="Belfast Telegraph 12 January 2016"/&gt;

Testimony was given that Black drove his victim to a lay-by to sexually abuse her, then returned through the village. In a statement read to the court, the victim stated she "didn't know he [Black] was a bad man" as Black had stared at her before bundling her into his van.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/274460-robert-black-trial-hears-of-thwarted-kidnap-attempt/|title=Robert Black trial hears of thwarted kidnap attempt|publisher=STV|date=12 October 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rebuttal, Kerrigan asserted again that the abduction had been unplanned, and that Black had intended to release the girl after assaulting her. He pointed out that Black freely admitted his paedophilic preferences, and claimed to have successfully fought against the urge to abduct young girls prior to the incident at issue. He also said that Black accepted that he was a danger to children and wished to undergo treatment.{{sfnp|Church|2015|p=113}}

===Life imprisonment===

{{quote box
| quote = "The abduction of this little girl was carried out with a chilling, cold calculation. This was no 'rush of blood', as you have claimed. This is a very serious case; a horrific, appalling case ... You will go to prison for life, and your release will not be considered until such a time as it is safe to do so."

| width = 35em
}}

Prior to sentencing, Ross paid tribute to Herkes, whose vigilance had led to Black's arrest. Sentencing Black to life imprisonment for what he described as "a horrific, appalling case", Ross said he was greatly influenced by the opinion of the psychiatrists, who had concluded that Black was, and would remain, an extreme danger to children.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=69}}

In September 1990, Black announced his intention to appeal his life sentence, but he later abandoned this. In November 1990, he was transferred to [[HM Prison Peterhead|Peterhead Prison]].

==Further investigation==
Two weeks after the Stow trial, Clark conducted a second, recorded interview with Black. He had appointed Andrew Watt and Roger Orr to conduct the interview, with instructions they were to tell Black that they would not be [[value judgment|judgemental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/how-many-more-young-lives-1366836|title=How many more young lives did Robert Black take?|first=Sophie|last=Doughty|date=26 June 2012|newspaper=[[Evening Chronicle]]|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the six-hour interview, Black freely discussed his early sexual experiences, his experimentation with various forms of self-abuse, and his attraction towards young children; he also described his penchant for wearing young girls' clothing,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=117}} and admitted to having sexually assaulted in excess of 30 young girls between the 1960s and 1980s. He was largely uncommunicative in response to questions even loosely pertaining to any unsolved child murders and disappearances, but said he had enticed two young girls into his van in Carlisle upon the pretext of asking for directions in late 1985, then allowed them to leave when eyewitnesses appeared.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=81–82}}

The latter stages of this interview saw both men steer their questioning directly to the subject of child abduction and murder, specifically in relation to the murder of Caroline Hogg. Informing Black that police had already established he had been in Portobello on the date of Hogg's abduction, Watt and Orr then tacitly informed him they had eyewitness accounts and petrol-station receipts, further proving that he was near Portobello on the date of Hogg's abduction. Orr then produced a [[facial composite|composite drawing]] of the man with whom Hogg had left the funfair, and placed this composite alongside photographs of Black dating from the early 1980s—highlighting their similarities.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=74}} Black's replies then became evasive and monosyllabic. Asked directly, at the end of the interview, to confess in order to end the suffering of his victims' families, he did not respond.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=118}}

Despite the fact the information gleaned in this interview did little to advance the murder inquiry, upon the conclusion of the interview, Clark informed his two colleagues: "That's our man. I'd bet my life on it."{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2371}}

===Accumulation of evidence===
Detectives from all forces in the UK linked to the joint manhunt then began an intense and painstaking endeavour to gather sufficient evidence to convince the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] to instigate legal proceedings against Black, with a reasonable chance of securing convictions. As was his [[natural and legal rights|legal right]], Black refused to cooperate with the detectives in their investigation.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=22}}

Investigators contacted Poster, Dispatch and Storage Ltd to establish whether travel records could confirm his whereabouts on crucial dates linked to the investigation. Staff at this firm were able to confirm that Black had always bought petrol using credit cards, the receipts of which he would then submit to his firm to claim [[expense]]s. These files, plus several historical delivery schedules, were still in the company's archives. Investigators discovered that Black had made scheduled delivery runs to the areas where the abductions had occurred on the relevant dates, and although the precise times he had been in the area were difficult to adduce, petrol receipts confirmed he had bought fuel close to where each girl had been abducted on the date of her disappearance. For example, on the date of Sarah Harper's disappearance, Black had been scheduled to make a series of deliveries across the Midlands and Northern England. The two final deliveries on this schedule had been in West Yorkshire: in [[Brighouse]], then a final delivery in Morley at a firm 150 yards from Harper's home.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph 27 October 2011"/&gt; Black had refuelled his van between these two destinations shortly before Harper had last been seen alive.

Investigators discovered that upon his return to London from his long-distance deliveries to Northern England or Scotland, Black had regularly slept overnight in a house in [[Donisthorpe]] which belonged to his landlord's son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/monster-who-killed-leeds-schoolgirl-sarah-harper-dies-in-jail-1-7671452|title=Monster who killed Leeds schoolgirl Sarah Harper dies in jail|newspaper=[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]|date=12 January 2016|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was close to where all three bodies had been discovered. Leeds detectives also discovered that, on his regular deliveries to Morley, Black often slept in his van overnight in the premises to which he delivered, which was close to Sarah Harper's home.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2371}}

Investigators learned that Poster, Dispatch and Storage Ltd had accounts with several oil companies, which allowed their drivers to buy fuel. With the cooperation of the companies, investigators obtained seven million archived [[microform|microfiched]] credit card slips detailing fuel purchases paid via this method at every one of their nationwide premises between 1982 and 1986. These were sent to the reopened incident room in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], where a team of officers searched them for Black's distinctive signature in an effort to pinpoint precisely when and where he had bought his fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/northern-ireland-news/police-refused-to-quit-in-30-year-hunt-for-killer-1-3192143|title=Police refused to quit in 30-year hunt for killer|newspaper=News Letter|date=28 October 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This laborious task bore fruit: beginning in October 1990, investigators began to discover evidence proving the precise times Black had bought fuel at petrol stations close to each abduction site. In each instance, the time of purchase had been shortly before or after each child had been abducted.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=124}}

By December 1990, the inquiry team decided they had sufficient circumstantial evidence to convince [[the Crown]] that there was a reasonable prospect of securing convictions against Black, although Clark was worried that the inquiry had not uncovered any [[forensic identification|forensic evidence]] to tie Black to the murders.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=126}} All the evidence was submitted to the Crown in May 1991.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=81}} In March 1992, Crown lawyers decided that the evidence was sufficient to try Black for the three murders and the attempted abduction of Teresa Thornhill. At a [[news conference]] held on 11 March, Hector Clark informed the press that "criminal proceedings have been issued on the authority of the Crown Prosecution Service against Robert Black".{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=131}}

Several pretrial hearings were held between July 1992 and March 1994; these hearings saw Black's defence counsel submit [[main contention|contention]]s that their client be tried on each count separately, and that the prosecution not be allowed to demonstrate any similarity between the [[modus operandi]] of each offence at the upcoming trial. In the penultimate pretrial hearing, in January 1994, [[William Macpherson (judge)|Judge William Macpherson]] ruled against defence motions to try Black on each charge separately, and also ruled to allow the prosecution to submit [[similar fact evidence]] between the cases. This ruling allowed the prosecution to make these similarities between the cases known, and to introduce into evidence Black's recent conviction for the abduction and sexual assault of the Stow schoolgirl. The prosecution was prohibited from introducing into evidence the transcript of the August 1990 interview between Black and detectives Watt and Orr.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=171}}

==Murder trials==
On 13 April 1994, Robert Black stood trial before Judge William Macpherson at [[Moot Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne|Moot Hall]], Newcastle upon Tyne. Black pleaded [[plea|not guilty]] to each of the 10 charges of kidnap, murder, attempted kidnap, and [[preventing the lawful burial of a body]].&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

In his opening statement on behalf of the Crown, prosecutor John Milford QC described the case to be tried as "every parent's nightmare"{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=141}} as he outlined the prosecution's contention that Robert Black had committed the three child murders and the attempted abduction, and the similarities between these offences and the 1990 abduction and sexual assault of the Stow schoolgirl for which Black was already serving a life sentence. Milford then described the circumstances of each abduction and murder for the jury; contending that each victim had remained alive in Black's van for several hours before her murder, and that each had been killed near the location Black had disposed of her body. In the latter stages of this five-hour opening statement, Milford contended that Black had kidnapped each victim for his own sexual gratification,&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; and pointed out Black's extensive record of child sexual abuse and the paraphernalia discovered in his vehicle and at his London address. Milford closed his speech by stating that the petrol receipts and travel records would prove Black had been at all the abduction, attempted abduction and body recovery sites on the dates in question.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=146}}

On the second day of the trial, the prosecution began to introduce witnesses, witness statements, circumstantial evidence, and forensic testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/susan-maxwell-seen-alone-before-disappearance-triple-murder-trial-told-of-surprise-at-sighting-1370277.html/|title=Susan Maxwell 'seen alone before disappearance': Triple murder trial told of surprise at sighting|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=15 April 1994|access-date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This saw witnesses describing the circumstances surrounding the abduction and subsequent discovery of each victim, and investigators describing the evidence uncovered of Black's movements on the dates of each abduction, the attempted abduction of Teresa Thornhill, and the kidnapping and assault of the Stow schoolgirl. Contemporary statements made by the mother of each murder victim at the time of her child's abduction were also read to the court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12674867.The_last_hours_of_Caroline_Hogg_Parents_tell_of_search_for_daughter/|title=The last hours of Caroline Hogg: Parents tell of search for daughter|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=21 April 1994|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside testimony from the pathologists who had examined the bodies. Upon hearing the details of the kidnaps and murders, relatives of the three murder victims wept openly in court.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; Black rarely displayed any interest throughout the proceedings, typically remaining expressionless.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=160}}

Several of these initial witnesses were subjected to intense [[cross-examination]] by Black's defence counsel, Ronald Thwaites, upon issues such as memory accuracy and minor discrepancies between times logged in record books at a firm to which Black had made a delivery on the date of Susan Maxwell's disappearance and those of petrol receipts introduced as evidence (this discrepancy was proven to be an [[administrative error]]{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=77}}), and earlier police statements given by the witnesses. Most witnesses maintained their insistence of the accuracy and honesty of their testimony.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=147}}

One of the witnesses cross-examined on the third day of the trial was James Fraser, a forensic scientist, who had examined more than 300 items recovered from Black's van and his London lodgings; Fraser conceded that in over 1,800 microscopic comparisons, no forensic link had been established between Black and the three victims. In direct re-examination by John Milford, Fraser said that the interval between the offences and Black's arrest, and the fact Black had only bought the van in which he was arrested in 1986, would make establishing a forensic link between the three murders unlikely.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=148}}

The final prosecution witnesses to testify were detectives from the police forces involved in the manhunt; they testified on 29 April, and much of their testimony described the scope of the investigation while Black had been at large, and the painstaking inquiries to gather evidence. The final detective to testify was Hector Clark, who testified that Black's name had never been entered into the HOLMES database during the manhunt due to his conviction pre-dating the timescale of those judged to warrant further investigation. Clark further explained he could not recall any other cases where children had been abducted, killed and their bodies transported considerable distances, before stating: "I don't believe there has been a bigger crime investigation in the United Kingdom, ever."{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=163}}

On 4 May, Ronald Thwaites began to outline his case in defence of Black. Thwaites reminded the jury the police had been unsuccessfully investigating these crimes for eight years before Black's 1990 arrest and conviction for the Stow abduction, and asserted that the investigators had seized on this case in an attempt to [[scapegoating|scapegoat]] his client to appease their feelings of "frustration and failure", and in an effort to restore broken reputations. Thwaites claimed that, although the paraphernalia introduced into evidence attested to his client's admitted obsession with paedophilic material,&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond Tolerance: Child Pornography on the Internet'' p.190&lt;/ref&gt; no direct evidence existed to prove Black had progressed from molester to murderer. Describing his decision not to permit Black to testify on his own behalf in relation to the petrol receipts and travel records, Thwaites informed the jury: "No man can be expected to remember the ordinary daily routine of his life going back many years."{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=165}} Thwaites then began to introduce witnesses to testify on behalf of the defence, and continued to do so until 10 May.

To support Thwaites' contention that the three murders were not part of a series and had not been committed by Black, much of the testimony delivered by the defence witnesses referred to sightings of alternative suspects and suspicious vehicles near each abduction. The evidence delivered by these eyewitnesses contradicted that of those who had earlier testified on behalf of the prosecution. For example, Thomas Ball testified that on the date of Susan Maxwell's abduction, he had observed a girl matching her description striking a maroon [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph]] saloon with a tennis racket. This car had contained at least two men, and the location Ball had seen this incident was very close to the site of Maxwell's abduction.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|pp=93–94}}

===Closing arguments===
On 12 May, both counsels delivered their [[closing argument]]s to the jury. Prosecutor John Milford argued first; opening his final address to the jury by describing the circumstances of Black's 1990 arrest and recounting the extensive circumstantial evidence presented throughout the trial, and emphasising the fact no physical evidence existed due to the interval between the offences and Black's arrest. In reference to the defence argument that Black's close proximity to each of the abduction and body disposal sites of the dates in question was mere coincidence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/defence-scorned-1435548.html|title=Defence scorned|access-date=15 July 2016|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=12 May 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milford stated that if this defence contention were true, it would be "the coincidence to end all coincidences". Milford then requested that the jury reach a guilty verdict.

Thwaites delivered his closing arguments on behalf of the defence. He began by asking the jury: "Where is the jury that will acquit a pervert of multiple murder?" before describing his client as someone against whom ample prejudice existed, but no [[legal burden of proof|hard evidence]].{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=169}} Thwaites pressed upon the jury the necessity to differentiate between a child sex pervert and an alleged child killer, before attacking the credibility of several prosecution witnesses, and pouring particular scorn upon the nationwide manhunt, stating: "The police have become exhausted in not finding anyone; the public are clamouring for a result. What good are you if you can't catch a child killer? Is he [Black] their salvation, or a convenient, expendable scapegoat?" Thwaites then referred to defence witness testimony which indicated someone else had committed the three murders, before resting his case.

Judge Macpherson delivered his final instructions to the jury on 16 May and the following morning. In his final address, Judge Macpherson implored the jury to discard any emotion or personal distaste for Black's extensive history of sexual offences against children when considering their verdict, and not to prejudge his guilt because of his 1990 conviction for the abduction and sexual assault of the Stow schoolgirl. Judge Macpherson further directed the jury to instead focus on the evidence presented at the trial and decide whether the "interlocking similarities" between the cases presented were sufficient to convince them of Black's guilt,&lt;ref name="Herald Scotland 17 May 1994"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12696240.Black_murder_trial_jury_retires_today_to_consider_verdicts/|title=Black murder trial jury retires today to consider verdicts|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=17 May 1994|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before reminding them that any conclusions of guilt on one charge must not determine guilt on the remaining nine charges they were to debate. The jury then received strict instructions against reading newspapers, watching television or making any telephone calls, before retiring to consider their verdict. These deliberations continued for two days.&lt;ref name="Herald Scotland 17 May 1994"/&gt;

===First murder convictions===
On 19 May, the jury found Black guilty of three counts of kidnapping, three counts of murder, three counts of preventing the lawful burial of a body{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2372}} and—in relation to Teresa Thornhill—one count of attempted abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8853804/I-can-still-see-Robert-Blacks-face-every-day.html|title='I can still see Robert Black's face every day'|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=27 October 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment for each of these counts, with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 35 years on each of the three murder charges. These life sentences were to be served concurrently. Passing sentence, Judge Macpherson described Black as being the perpetrator of "offences which are unlikely ever to be forgotten and which represent a man at his most vile".&lt;ref name="True Crime"&gt;''True Crime'' August 1994 p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Black [[reduced affect display|remained unmoved]] upon receipt of this sentence, but as he prepared to leave the dock, he turned to the detectives from the various forces present at his sentencing who, since 1982, had been involved in his manhunt and proclaimed, "Tremendous. Well done, boys."{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=175}} This statement caused several of the detectives to weep.&lt;ref name="Chronicle 11 December 2001"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/child-killer-the-truth-1685092|title=Child killer: The truth|date=11 December 2001|newspaper=Evening Chronicle|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black was then taken to [[HM Prison Wakefield|Wakefield prison]], to begin his sentence in the segregation unit, as a [[Prisoner security categories in the United Kingdom#Male adult prisoners|Category A prisoner]].&lt;ref name="chroniclelive"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/northumberland-schoolgirl-killer-robert-black-8472703|title=Northumberland schoolgirl killer Robert Black has taunted officers interviewing him about missing girl|first=Sophie|last=Doughty|date=19 January 2015|newspaper=Evening Chronicle|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately following these convictions, the more than 20 detectives involved in the manhunt who had been present at his sentencing addressed the press assembled outside Moot Hall, with Hector Clark stating: "The tragedy is these three beautiful children who should never have died. Black is the most evil of characters and I hope there is not now or ever another one like him."{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=176}} When asked his personal feelings towards Robert Black, Clark stated: "Black is a man of the most evil kind, but no longer important to me. I care not about him."&lt;ref name="True Crime August 1994 p. 14"/&gt;

==Fourth murder trial==
On 15 December 2009, Black was served with a [[summons#England and Wales|summons]] to attend trial in Northern Ireland for the 1981 murder of Jennifer Cardy. He was charged the following day.&lt;ref name="BBCNews16December2009"/&gt;

Black's trial for the sexual assault and murder of Jennifer Cardy began at [[Armagh Crown Court]] on 22 September 2011.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8783154/Van-driver-accused-of-girls-murder-linked-to-crime-by-old-petrol-receipts.html|title=Van driver accused of girl's murder 'linked to crime by old petrol receipts'|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=22 September 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15011434|title=Mother of Jennifer Cardy recalls her last movements|work=BBC News|date=22 September 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was tried before Judge Ronald Weatherup, and acknowledged that he may have been in Northern Ireland on the date of Cardy's abduction, but pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Circumstantial evidence attesting to Black's guilt of Cardy's murder had been obtained by Northern Ireland investigators searching through petrol receipts—560,000 in total—stored in his former employer's archives to ascertain Black's whereabouts on the dates surrounding the abduction and murder. Black's trial began with the prosecutor, Toby Hedworth, stating that the discovery of Black's signature upon these receipts was as good as signing his own confession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15215541|title=Jennifer Cardy accused Robert Black is multiple killer|work=BBC News|date=7 October 2011|access-date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second day of the trial, prosecutors introduced into evidence petrol receipts proving he had been near Ballinderry on the date of her abduction. Further evidence presented at trial included a salary ledger proving Black had been paid £50, which had only been given to drivers from his firm who made deliveries to Northern Ireland, and an [[order book (trading)|order book]] confirming a delivery of billboard posters had been due near Ballinderry on the date of the abduction. Black was one of only two employees of Poster Dispatch and Storage Ltd willing to travel to Northern Ireland due to [[the Troubles]], and travel records from all other drivers employed at this firm eliminated them from any culpability on the date of Cardy's abduction.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; The records also showed that, on the night of the abduction, Black had boarded an overnight ferry from Northern Ireland to [[Liverpool]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lisburn.com/archives/info/news-2011/jennnifer-cardy.html#2|title=Dispute over invoice evidence|newspaper=Ulster Star|date=30 September 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before refuelling his van at [[Coventry]] the following day, en route to London.

In an effort to discredit the prosecution's contention that Black had been making deliveries to Ireland, Black's defence counsel, David Spens, suggested on the fourth day of the trial the Coventry petrol receipt could only indicate Black had been making deliveries to Coventry on the day after Cardy's murder; in rebuttal, Toby Hedworth questioned a colleague of Black's, who confirmed the firm did not make deliveries to Coventry in the early 1980s.

To further support the prosecution's contention that Cardy's murder had been committed by Black, Nathaniel Cary, a forensic pathologist, testified on the 11th day of the trial to the similarities between Cardy's abduction and murder, and that of Sarah Harper. Cary testified that the circumstances of the two girls' deaths were "remarkably similar", and that the injuries inflicted upon both girls' bodies strongly suggested both girls had been alive, albeit likely unconscious, when their bodies had been placed in water.&lt;ref name="Ulster Star"/&gt;

===Further conviction===
Black's second murder trial lasted six weeks, and the jury deliberated for four hours before delivering their verdict. On 27 October, he was found guilty of Cardy's abduction, sexual assault, and murder. Black was given a further life sentence,&lt;ref name=BBCOct2011&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15445986|title=Child killer Robert Black found guilty of murdering Jennifer Cardy|date=27 October 2011|work=BBC News|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with hearings deferred on the minimum term to be served.

On 8 December, Judge Weatherup imposed a minimum term of 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cardy|first=Jennifer|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8943177/Child-killer-Robert-Black-to-serve-25-years-for-murdering-Jennifer-Cardy.html|title=Child killer Robert Black to serve 25 years for murdering Jennifer Cardy|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=8 December 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weatherup informed Black: "Your crime was particularly serious; you subjected a vulnerable child to unpardonable terror and took away her life." Prior to his final sentencing for this fourth murder, Black's defence lawyer, David Spens, had informed the court that no plea for [[mercy#Law and ethics|mercy]] could be offered for his client; stating the case in question was "one of those rare cases in which there is no [[mitigation (law)|mitigation]], and so I propose to say nothing in that regard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McDonald|first=Henry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/08/robert-black-sentenced-25-years|title=Child killer Robert Black sentenced to 25 years for murder of Jennifer Cardy|date=8 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Walker|first = Gail|date = 13 January 2016|title= Robert Black destroyed Jennifer Cardy's life but we didn't allow evil paedophile to destroy our family|url= http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/robert-black-destroyed-jennifer-cardys-life-but-we-didnt-allow-evil-paedophile-to-destroy-our-family-34359957.html|newspaper=The Belfast Telegraph|access-date= 5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At his sentencing, Black was informed that he would be at least 89 before he would be considered for release.&lt;ref name=BBCDec2011&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-16086642|title=Cardy family 'do not hate' child killer Robert Black|date=8 December 2011|work=BBC News|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suspected victims==
Police believe that Black had committed more murders than the four for which he was convicted, with senior detectives believing the true number to be at least eight.&lt;ref name="heraldscotland.com"/&gt;{{sfnp|Wyre|Tate|1995|p=12}} In July 1994, a meeting was convened between senior detectives from the six police forces involved in the nationwide manhunt for Black, and representatives from other UK forces with unsolved missing child and child murder cases. The meeting assessed the evidence investigators had assembled to establish whether Black had killed other children.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=190}}

In 2008, the Crown Prosecution Service stated that [[legal burden of proof|insufficient evidence]] existed to charge Black with any further murders.&lt;ref name="independent19May1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2579716/Prime-suspect-in-1978-murder-of-schoolgirl-Genette-Tate-will-not-face-charges.html|title=Prime suspect in 1978 murder of schoolgirl Genette Tate will not face charges|last=Edwards|first=Richard|date=18 August 2008|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black has been linked to 13 further child murders and disappearances across the UK, Ireland, and continental Europe committed between 1969 and 1987.&lt;ref name="chroniclelive"/&gt;{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=107}}{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|pp=2372–2373}}

===France===

5 May 1987: Virginie Delmas (10). Abducted from [[Neuilly-sur-Marne]] on 5 May 1987. Her nude body was found in a [[Paris]] orchard on 9 October. Delmas had been strangled; the extent of decomposition prevented the pathologist determining whether she had been raped before death. Black made several deliveries in and around Paris on the date of Delmas's disappearance.

30 May 1987: Hemma Greedharry (10). Discovered in the Paris suburb of [[Malakoff]] two hours after she was last seen alive. She had been raped and strangled. Black is known to have regularly travelled upon the road where Greedharry's body was found when making deliveries in northern France.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2373}}

3 June 1987: Perrine Vigneron (7). Vigneron disappeared on her way to buy a Mother's Day card in [[Bouleurs]] en route to attending a pottery course; her strangled body was discovered in a [[rapeseed]] field in [[Chelles, Seine-et-Marne|Chelles]] on 27 June. A white van had been seen in Bouleurs on the day of Vigneron's disappearance.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2373}}

27 June 1987: Sabine Dumont (9). A Paris schoolgirl last seen alive in [[Bièvres, Essonne|Bièvres]] on 27 June. Her strangled and sexually assaulted body was found the following day in the commune of [[Vauhallan]].{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2373}} Black was named as a prime suspect in Dumont's murder in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;''True Detective'' April 2016 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath, imprisonment and death==
The eight-year, nationwide inquiry which culminated in the 1990 arrest of Robert Black was one of the longest, most exhaustive and costly British murder investigations of the 20th century.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=73}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15434091|title=Jennifer Cardy: A 30-year wait for justice|work=BBC News|date=27 October 2011|access-date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time investigators had amassed sufficient evidence to convince the Crown to instigate criminal proceedings against Black for the three child murders and the attempted abduction of Thornhill, the dossier they had assembled was estimated to weigh 22 [[tonne]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/qc-reveals-evidence-convicted-robert-1406622|title=QC reveals evidence that convicted Robert Black|first=Dan|last=Warburton|date=4 November 2011|newspaper=Evening Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost of the inquiry is estimated to be £12 million.&lt;ref&gt;''Mapping Murder: The Secrets of Geographical Profiling p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Black appealed against his 1994 convictions. His appeal was heard before [[Peter Taylor, Baron Taylor of Gosforth|Lord Taylor]] at the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales#Criminal Division|Court of Appeal]] on 20 February 1995. Black contended he had been denied a fair trial due to details of his 1990 abduction and sexual assault charges being introduced as similar fact evidence at his trial, a ruling his defence counsel had fundamentally objected to. Black also contended that the final instructions delivered to the jury by Judge Macpherson had been unbalanced.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=181–182}} Black's appeal hearing had been expected to last three days, but at the end of the first day, Lord Taylor refused leave to appeal the conviction on the grounds that Black's trial had been fair, and that none of his contentions could be substantiated.

In July 1995, Black was attacked in his cell at Wakefield prison by two fellow inmates, who threw boiling water mixed with sugar over him, bludgeoned him with a table leg, then stabbed him in the back and neck with an improvised knife. Black sustained superficial wounds, burns and bruising in this attack; his attackers were jailed for three further years after admitting wounding Black with intent to cause [[grievous bodily harm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12054487.Two_jailed_for_Black_ambush_Inmates_tried_to__rip_skin_off_apos__murderer|title=Two jailed for Black ambush Inmates tried to 'rip skin off' murderer|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=3 January 1996|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black never admitted [[culpability]] in any of the murders of which he was convicted or suspected, and refused to cooperate with investigators, in spite of having little hope of ever being freed. According to [[Ray Wyre|Dr Ray Wyre]], a pioneer in the treatment of sex offenders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/aug/08/psychology.ukcrime|title=Obituary: Ray Wyre|first=Edward|last=Marriott|date=7 August 2008|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who conducted several interviews with Black between 1990 and 1993, the prime reason for this was an issue of control for Black. Wyre summarised the [[psychology]] behind Black's refusal to cooperate with investigators: &lt;blockquote&gt;He's the sort of person for whom it's all about power and control. Having information about what he's done gives him power. He has no desire to ease his conscience, and he's not going to give up the one thing that gives him power over the pain that his victims' families are suffering.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The closest Black ever came to confessing to any of his crimes was in response to a question put to him shortly before his 1994 murder trial by Wyre. Wyre had asked Black why he never denied any of the charges brought against him. According to Wyre, Black had replied to this question with the words, "Because I couldn't."{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=96}}

Black died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[HMP Maghaberry]] on 12 January 2016.&lt;ref name="heart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truecrimelibrary.com/magazinearticle/death-of-a-serial-killer-robert-blacks-timeline-of-terror/|title=Death of A Serial Killer – Robert Black’s Timeline Of Terror|publisher=True Crime Library|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dies"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-35296135|title=Robert Black: Convicted child killer dies in prison|date=12 January 2016|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was [[cremation|cremated]] at Roselawn Crematorium, outside Belfast, on 29 January.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16364">'''Ronald Jones''' (born July 8, 1952 in the [[United States]]) is an [[artist]], [[critic]] and [[educator]] who gained prominence in [[New York City]] during the mid-1980s. In the magazine ''[[Contemporary (magazine)|Contemporary]]'', [[Brandon Labelle]] wrote: "Working as an artist, writer, curator, professor, lecturer and critic over the last 20 years, Jones is a self-styled [[Conceptual art|Conceptualist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kim Levin |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/art/0019,159644,14858,13.html |title=Masters of the Universe - Page 1 - Art - New York |publisher=Village Voice |date=2000-05-16 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; spanning the worlds of academia and art, opera and garden design, and acting as paternal spearhead of contemporary critical practice. Explorative and provocative, Jones creates work that demands attention that is both perceptual and political."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contemporary-magazines.com/1024x7 ]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labelle positions Jones along the leading edge of a "contemporary critical practice" that is perhaps best described as [[interdisciplinary]] or [[transdisciplinary]].

==1980s==
Jones graduated in 1974, with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Montomery, Alabama]]'s  [[Huntingdon College]]. He completed an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] degree in sculpture from the [[University of South Carolina]], followed by a [[Ph.D]]. in Interdisciplinary Arts at [[Ohio University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohio.edu/interarts/ |title=:: School of Interdisciplinary Arts @ Ohio University - Home :: |publisher=Ohio.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote about a collaboration between [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. In 1983, he was included in a group exhibition titled "A Likely Story," at [[Artists space]] in New York City which was curated by Valerie Smith and included [[Gretchen Bender]], [[David Cabrera (artist)|David Cabrera]], and [[Jeff Koons]]. In 1985 he moved to New York City and two years later had his first [[solo exhibition]] at [[Metro Pictures Gallery]]. In the ''[[New York Times]]'', Roberta Smith wrote: "Mr. Jones's main goal seems to be to thwart the eye with formal incoherence and an overload of written information that the mind must digest before his pieces make sense. But the sense made is never visual. Instead, if one wades through the long illustrated paragraph that constitutes each work's title, learning the artwork or event that each component represents, a kind of odd and often frightening poetic logic accrues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Roberta |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2DB1539F934A15751C1A967958260 |title=Art in Review - Review - NYTimes.com |publisher=New York Times |date=1991-12-27 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jones is represented by [[Metro Pictures Gallery]] where his last of six solo shows was in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metropicturesgallery.com/index.php?mode=past |title=Metro Pictures &amp;#124; Exhibitions |publisher=Metropicturesgallery.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050527042124/http://www.metropicturesgallery.com/index.php?mode=past |archive-date=2005-05-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones began his curatorial practice in 1986, when he assembled The Public Art Show with a catalog designed by [[Louise Lawler]] and a poster by [[Barbara Kruger]]. He went on to organize eleven exhibitions for New York City galleries (Metro Pictures, [[Lehmann Maupin]] and [[Josh Baer]]) and European and [[Scandinavia]]ny institutions ("Dark Side of the Moon," Stockholm Cultural Capital of Europe Arkipelag project, 1998 and Magasin 3 Projekt Djurgårdsbrunn, 2003).

In 1987, he began writing criticism for ''[[Arts Magazine]]'' and ''[[Artscribe]]''. Soon after, he began contributing articles, essays and reviews to ''[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze]]'', ''[[Artforum]]'', ''Bookforum'', ''Art in America'', ''Parkett'', ''Cabinet'', ''Zone'' and others. Jones wrote numerous catalogs for other artists including Elizabeth Peyton,&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-3-7757-9099-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Laurie Simmons, David Salle, Terry Winters, Richard Phillips, Carroll Dunham, and Keith Edmier.

In 1989 Jones was invited to join the faculty at the School of Art, [[Yale University]] as Critic in Sculpture and ultimately was named Senior Critic.

==1990s==

In 1992 Jones served as the spokesman for the [[National Endowment of the Arts]] peer-review panel for fellowships in sculpture, which launched one of many high-profile national debates on [[censorship]] and First Amendment issues in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Honan |first=William H. |author-link=William H.

In 1993 he had a solo exhibition at the [[Sonnabend Gallery]] in New York City. As his work continued to be exhibited internationally (including solo exhibitions in [[Berlin]], [[Tokyo]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Paris]], and [[Cologne]]) Jones was commissioned to design garden projects including [[Pritzker Park]] in Chicago, the Rethymnon Centre of Contemporary Art in Crete, the  [[Botanical Gardens]] in [[Curitiba, Brazil]], [[Caesar’s Cosmic Garden]] [[Boras Konstmuseet]], [[Sweden]] and a garden for the city of [[Hamburg, Germany]] among others.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:jones garden.jpg|thumbnail|left|Pritzker Park, Chicago, Illinois, 1992.

In 1995, ArtForum magazine's "Best and Worst 1995" article stated that Jones should be "a nominee for a lifetime achievement award for contemporary-art awfulness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_n4_v34/ai_17837647/ |title=Best and worst 1995 &amp;#124; ArtForum &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 he was appointed professor and Chairman of the Visual Arts Department at [[Columbia University]]. At Columbia he was the Director of the Digital Media Center and Co-Director of the Interactive Design Lab. While at Columbia he served on the faculty of the MA Colloquia in the Masters Program in Critical Studies, Department of Art History and Archeology and taught in seminars at The Computer Music Department.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:jones opera.jpg|thumbnail|left|"Falling and Waving," still from opera produced by Brooklyn Academy of Music and Arts at Saint Ann's, New York City, 1999.

He served on the Boards of Artists Space, the [[Public Art Fund]], and [[Franklin Furnace]], all in New York City, the Princeton Sculpture Symposium, and was a Member of the Executive Committee of the Lucent Project, [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]].

In 1999, Jones conceived of, and wrote the libretto for "Falling and Waving," the first computer generated opera produced by the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] and Arts at Saint Ann's in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jayscheib.com/falling/index.html |title=Falling and Waving (a digital opera) :::: directed by Jay Scheib |publisher=Jayscheib.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7779">'''Safety-valve organization''' or '''safety-valve institution''' is a term used in sociology to describe organizations which serve to allow discontented individuals to act out their opposition to other elements, as it were "to let off steam".&lt;ref name="Poloma1979"/&gt; Safety-valve organizations reduce tensions in society and in the [[structural functionalism|structural-functionalist]] perspective can be said to have a tension-reducing [[latent function]].&lt;ref name=strike/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aasved2003"/&gt; Safety-valve organizations are outlets for behavior that is considered [[deviance (sociology)|deviant]], but cannot be eradicated from society, and such organizations prevent tensions from accumulating; thus tolerance of some deviant behavior in various safety-valve organizations prevents more serious problems.&lt;ref name="VitoMaahs2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tischler2006"/&gt; Therefore, one of the primary functions of the deviance itself is to act as a safety-valve.{{clarify|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref name="GrunlanMayers1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sociology in Perspective"/&gt; Without safety-valve organizations, interactions between certain groups would become much more limited, and conflict much more severe.&lt;ref name="Poloma1979"/&gt;

==Examples==
Safety-valve institutions range from mostly legal and reputable ([[strike (action)|strikes]],&lt;ref name="strike"/&gt; [[arts]],&lt;ref name="Merriam1964"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal of Mental Imagery"/&gt; and  [[sport]]s), to less so ([[pranks]],&lt;ref name="GrunlanMayers1988"/&gt; [[casino]]s and [[gambling]] institutions in general,&lt;ref name="Aasved2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gambling: A Sociological Review"/&gt; [[pornography]]&lt;ref name="Light2002"/&gt;) to mostly illegal ([[prostitution]]&lt;ref name="The Idea of Prostitution"/&gt;). Societies of different kinds vary widely in the legal status of these activities. In their most extreme, aggression in general and war in particular have also been described as safety-valve institutions.&lt;ref name="Ruse1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Expansion and Warfare among Swidden Agriculturalists"/&gt;

With regard to specific organizations, [[Better Business Bureau]] has been described as a safety valve institution, as it "mitigates conflicts between business and consumer".&lt;ref name="Poloma1979"/&gt; Safety-valve organizations can exist in politics, where they provide an outlet for those dissatisfied with the political and social situation to legally organize and discuss it. For example, Saugat K. Biswas notes that the [[Indian National Congress]] was such an organization in late 19th-century India.&lt;ref name="Biswas2008"/&gt; Moren-Alegret similarly discusses the Portuguese [[NGO]] [[Secretariado Coordenador das Acções de Legalização]] (Coordinating Secretariat for Legalization Actions, an immigrant association) in a similar context.&lt;ref name="King2001"/&gt; As an example of mostly criminal safety-valve organizations, Farchild discusses the Japanese [[yakuza]].&lt;ref name="Fairchild1993"/&gt;

The '''Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre''' ({{lang-sl|Gledališče sester Scipion Nasice}}) was founded on October 13, 1983, with a founding manifesto (The Sister Letter). The manifesto set this theatre group a time frame of operation – four years – and described its stages from formation to self-destruction. The Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre (1983-1987) constituted – along with [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]] and [[IRWIN]] groups – one of the three pillars of the [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]] retrogarde movement. Within the retrogarde movement, theatre research engaged in the relation between religion, art and state. It focused on rituals and the function of spectacle in theatre and in the function of spectacle the state.

The founders of the Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre were [[Eda Čufer]], [[Dragan Živadinov]] and [[Miran Mohar]].

The retrogarde production of events, as it was announced in the manifesto (The Sister Letter), incorporated an external manifestative part (actions) and an internal creative part (operations):
- external part: The Appearance (1983), The Resurrection (1984) and The Self-Destruction (1987)
- internal part: three stages of transformation - The Illegality (1984), The Exorcism (1985) and The Retro-Classic (1986)

In 1987, the Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre performed self-destruction.

'''Soft power''' is the ability to attract and [[Co-option|co-opt]], rather than [[coerce]] ([[hard power]]). Soft power is the ability to shape the preferences of others through appeal and attraction. A defining feature of soft power is that it is non-coercive; the currency of soft power is culture, political values, and foreign policies. Recently, the term has also been used in changing and influencing social and public opinion through relatively less transparent channels and [[lobbying]] through powerful political and non-political organizations. In 2012, [[Joseph Nye]] of [[Harvard University]] explained that with soft power, "the best [[propaganda]] is not propaganda", further explaining that during the [[Information Age]], "credibility is the scarcest resource."&lt;ref name=WSJmay2012&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nye |first1=Joseph |title=China's Soft Power Deficit To catch up, its politics must unleash the many talents of its civil society |url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304451104577389923098678842 |accessdate=6 December 2014 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nye coined the term in a 1990 book, ''Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power''. In this book, he wrote: “when one country gets other countries to want what it wants-might be called co-optive or soft power in contrast with the hard or command power of ordering others to do what it wants.”&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 1990"&gt;Nye, Joseph.''Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power''(New York: Basic Books, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; He further developed the concept in his 2004 book, ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics''. The term is now widely used in international affairs by analysts and statesmen. For example, [[US Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] spoke of the need to enhance American soft power by "a dramatic increase in spending on the civilian instruments of [[national security]] – [[diplomacy]], [[strategic communications]], foreign assistance, civic action and [[economic reconstruction]] and development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |author=Robert M.

== Description ==
[[File:Soft Power (2004) by Joseph Nye.jpg|thumb|left|Joseph Nye's 2004 book describing the concept of "soft power"]]

[[Joseph Nye]] introduced the concept of "soft power" in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Power-Means-Success-Politics/dp/1586482254/&lt;/ref&gt; For Nye, power is the ability to influence the behavior of others to get the outcomes you want. There are several ways one can achieve this: you can coerce them with threats; you can induce them with payments; or you can attract and co-opt them to want what you want. This soft power – getting others to want the outcomes you want – co-opts people rather than coerces them.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 1990"/&gt;

It can be contrasted with '[[hard power]]', which is the use of coercion and payment. Soft power can be wielded not just by states but also by all actors in international politics, such as [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] or international institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Nye, ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered the "second face of power" that indirectly allows you to obtain the outcomes you want. A country's soft power, according to Nye, rests on three resources: "its culture (in places where it is attractive to others), its political values (when it lives up to them at home and abroad), and its foreign policies (when others see them as legitimate and having moral authority)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Future_of_Power.html?id=AH08y1Bi1Y0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"A country may obtain the outcomes it wants in world politics because other countries – admiring its values, emulating its example, aspiring to its level of prosperity and openness – want to follow it. In this sense, it is also important to set the agenda and attract others in world politics, and not only to force them to change by threatening military force or economic sanctions. This soft power – getting others to want the outcomes that you want – co-opts people rather than coerces them."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Soft power resources are the assets that produce attraction which often leads to acquiescence.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004"/&gt; Nye asserts that, "Seduction is always more effective than coercion, and many values like democracy, human rights, and individual opportunities are deeply seductive."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004) p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angelo Codevilla]] observed that an often overlooked essential aspect of soft power is that different parts of populations are attracted or repelled by different things, ideas, images, or prospects.&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008"&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Soft power is hampered when policies, culture, or values repel others instead of attracting them.

In his book, Nye argues that soft power is a more difficult instrument for governments to wield than hard power for two reasons: many of its critical resources are outside the control of governments, and soft power tends to "work indirectly by shaping the environment for policy, and sometimes takes years to produce the desired outcomes."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71"&gt;Lord, Carnes, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power,"in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008.) pp. 59–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The book identifies three broad categories of soft power: "culture", "political values", and "policies."

In ''The Future of Power'' (2011), Nye reiterates that soft power is a descriptive, rather than a normative, concept.&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 81"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, soft power can be wielded for nefarious purposes. "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Josef Stalin|Stalin]], and [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] all possessed a great deal of soft power in the eyes of their acolytes, but that did not make it good. It is not necessarily better to twist minds than to twist arms."&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 81" /&gt; Nye also claims that soft power does not contradict the international relations theory of [[Realism (international relations)|realism]]. "Soft power is not a form of idealism or liberalism. It is simply a form of power, one way of getting desired outcomes."&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 82"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations of the concept ==
{{+rs|date=March 2016}}
Soft power has been criticized as being ineffective by authors such as [[Niall Ferguson]] in the preface to ''Colossus''. [[Neorealism (international relations)|Neorealist]] and other rationalist and neorationalist authors (with the exception of [[Stephen Walt]]) dismiss soft power out of hand as they assert that actors in international relations respond to only two types of incentives: economic incentives and force.

As a concept, it can be difficult to distinguish between soft power from hard power. For example, Janice Bially Mattern argues that [[George W. Bush]]'s use of the phrase "you are either with us or with the terrorists" was in fact an exercise of hard power. Though military and economic force was not used to pressure other states to join its coalition, a kind of force – representational force – was used. This kind of force threatens the identity of its partners, forcing them to comply or risk being labelled as evil. This being the case, soft power is therefore not so soft.&lt;ref&gt;Janice Bially Mattern, "Why 'Soft Power' Isn't So Soft: Representational Force and the Sociolinguistic Construction of Attraction in World Politics," ''Millennium: Journal of International Studies'' 33, no. 3 (2005): 586.&lt;/ref&gt; However, rationalist authors{{Who|date=May 2013}} would merely see this as an 'implied threat', and that direct economic or military sanctions would likely follow from being 'against us'.

== Measurement ==
The first attempt to measure soft power through a composite index was created and published by the [[Institute for Government]] and the media company ''[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=McClory|title=The new persuaders: an international ranking of soft power|date=2010-12-07|publisher=Institute for Government|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications_download.php?id=20|work=Institute for Government website|page=13|accessdate=2011-05-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724053803/http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications_download.php?id=20|archivedate=2011-07-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IfG-Monocle Soft Power Index combined a range of statistical metrics and subjective panel scores to measure the soft power resources of 26 countries. The metrics were organized according to a framework of five sub-indices including culture, diplomacy, education, business/innovation, and government. The index is said to measure the soft power resources of countries, and does not translate directly into ability influence. ''Monocle'' has published an annual ''Soft Power Survey'' since then. As of 2016/17, the list is calculated using around 50 factors that indicate the use of soft power, including the number of cultural missions (primarily language schools), [[Olympic medals]], the quality of a country's [[architecture]] and business brands.&lt;ref name="monocle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://monocle.com/film/affairs/soft-power-survey-2016-17/|title=Soft Power Survey 2016/17|date=2016|publisher=Monocle|accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Soft Power 30'', which includes a foreword by Joseph Nye, is a ranking of countries' soft power produced and published by the media company ''Portland'' in 2015. The ranking is based on "the quality of a country’s political institutions, the extent of their cultural appeal, the strength of their diplomatic network, the global reputation of their higher education system, the attractiveness of their economic model, and a country’s digital engagement with the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Soft Power 30 - A Global Ranking of Soft Power|url=http://softpower30.portland-communications.com/pdfs/the_soft_power_30.pdf|publisher=Portland|accessdate=17 July 2015|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Softly does it|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21657655-oxbridge-one-direction-and-premier-league-bolster-britains-power-persuade-softly-does-it|accessdate=17 July 2015|work=The Economist|date=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In ‘soft power’ terms, Japan ranks eighth out of 30 countries in U.K. consultancy report|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/07/15/national/soft-power-terms-japan-ranks-eighth-30-u-k-consultancy-gauge/#.Value4u-ra4|accessdate=17 July 2015|work=Japan Times|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Elcano Global Presence Report'' scores the [[European Union]] first for soft presence when its member states are excluded and the EU is considered as a whole.&lt;ref name=ElcanoEU /&gt;

Soft power, then, represents the third behavioral way of getting the outcomes you want. Soft power is contrasted with hard power, which has historically been the predominant realist measure of national power, through [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] such as [[population]] size, concrete [[military]] assets, or a nation's [[gross domestic product]]. But having such resources does not always produce the desired outcomes, as the United States discovered in the Vietnam War. The extent of attraction can be measured by public opinion polls, by elite interviews, and case studies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Nye argues that soft power is more than influence, since influence can also rest on the hard power of threats or payments. And soft power is more than just persuasion or the ability to move people by argument, though that is an important part of it. It is also the ability to attract, and attraction often leads to acquiescence.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In [[international relations]], soft power is generated only in part by what the government does through its policies and public diplomacy. The generation of soft power is also affected in positive (and negative) ways by a host of non-state actors within and outside the country. Those actors affect both the general public and governing elites in other countries, and create an enabling or disabling environment for government policies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In some cases, soft power enhances the probability of other elites adopting policies that allow one to achieve preferred outcomes. In other cases, where being seen as friendly to another country is seen as a local political kiss of death, the decline or absence of soft power will prevent a government from obtaining particular goals. But even in such instances, the interactions of civil societies and non-state actors may help to further general milieu goals such as democracy, liberty, and development. Soft power is not the possession of any one country or actor.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The success of soft power heavily depends on the actor's [[reputation]] within the [[international community]], as well as the flow of information between actors. Thus, soft power is often associated with the rise of [[globalization]] and [[Neoliberalism (international relations)|neoliberal international relations theory]]. [[Popular culture]] and [[mass media]] are regularly identified as a source of soft power,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france|title=Economic warfare on the silver screen|publisher=FRANCE 24|date=28 June 2011|accessdate=2012-01-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france|archivedate=19 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the spread of a national language or a particular set of [[norm (sociology)|normative]] structures; a nation with a large amount of soft power and the good will that engenders it inspire others to [[acculturation|acculturate]], avoiding the need for expensive [[hard power]] expenditures.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} More particularly, [[World news|international news]] was found crucial in shaping the image and reputation of foreign countries. The high prominence of the US in international news, for example, has been linked to its soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blondheim|first1=Menahem|last2=Segev|first2=Elad|title=Just Spell US Right: America’s News Prominence and Soft Power|journal=Journalism Studies|date=2015|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2015.1114899|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2015.1114899|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive news coverage was associated with positive international views, while negative news coverage with negative views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Segev|first=Elad|title=International News Online: Global Views with Local Perspectives|year=2016|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|isbn=9781433129841|pages=139–153|url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=85473&amp;concordeid=312985|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611205324/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=85473&amp;concordeid=312985|archivedate=2016-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because soft power has appeared as an alternative to raw power politics, it is often embraced by ethically-minded scholars and policymakers. But soft power is a descriptive rather than a normative concept. Like any form of power, it can be wielded for good or bad purposes. While soft power can be used with bad intentions and wreak horrible consequences, it differs in terms of means. It is on this dimension that one might construct a normative preference for greater use of soft power.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Research ==

Academics have engaged in several debates around soft power. These have included:
* Its usefulness (Giulio Gallarotti, Niall Ferguson, Josef Joffe, Robert Kagan, Ken Waltz, Mearsheimer vs Nye, Katzenstein, Janice Bially Mattern, Jacques Hymans, Alexander Vuving, Jan Mellisen)
* How soft power and hard power interact (Giulio Gallarotti, Joseph Nye)
* Whether soft power can be coercive or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], (Janice BIally Mattern, Katzenstein, Duvall &amp; Barnet vs Nye, Vuving)
* How the relationship between [[structure and agency]] work (Hymans vs Nye)
* Whether soft balancing is occurring (Wohlforth &amp; Brooks vs Walt ''et al''.)
* Soft power and normative power in Europe (Ian Manners, A Ciambra, Thomas Diez, A Hyde Pryce, Richard Whitman)
* How [[civil resistance]] (i.e., non-violent forms of resistance) can often involve certain uses of soft power, but remains a distinct concept (Adam Roberts, Timothy Garton Ash)
* The ways through which states' attempts at soft power can backfire, leading to instances of 'soft disempowerment' (Paul Michael Brannagan and Richard Giulianotti)

One study finds that a state's soft power has a measurable effect on its exports. Countries that are admired for their positive global influence export more, holding other things constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Soft power raises exports|url = http://www.voxeu.org/article/soft-power-raises-exports|website = VoxEU.org|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Throughout the world ===
The Soviet Union competed with the U.S. for influence throughout the [[Cold War]]. The Soviets were engaged in a broad campaign to convince the world of the attractiveness of its Communist system. In 1945, the Soviet Union was very effective in attracting many in Europe from its resistance to Hitler, and in colonized areas around the world because of its opposition to European imperialism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004). Ch 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets also employed a substantially large [[public diplomacy]] program that included: promoting their high culture, broadcasting, disseminating disinformation about the West, and sponsoring nuclear protests, peace movements, and youth organizations. Despite all of this, the Soviets' closed system and lack of popular culture impeded the ability of the Soviet Union to compete with the U.S. in terms of soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Soviet soft power in Poland : culture and the making of Stalin's new empire, 1943-1957 |last=Babiracki |first=Patryk |date=2015 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |isbn=9781469623085 |location=Chapel Hill |oclc=911173017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Autocracy|non-democratic governments]] have attempted to use [[Human migration|migration]] as an instrument of soft power: [[Egypt]] under the rule of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] trained and dispatched thousands of teachers across the [[Arab world]] in an effort to spread ideas of [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonialism]] and [[anti-Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tsourapas |first=Gerasimos |date= |title=Authoritarian emigration states: Soft power and cross-border mobility in the Middle East |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0192512118759902 |journal=International Political Science Review |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=400-416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cuba]], the [[Fidel Castro]] regime's [[Cuban medical internationalism|medical internationalism]] programme has dispatched thousands of medical professionals abroad for cultural diplomacy purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cuban medical internationalism : origins, evolution, and goals |last=Kirk |first=John M. |date=2009 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |last2=Erisman |first2=H.

After [[Pope John Paul II]] visited [[Poland]] in 1979, some political commentators said his visit influenced events against Poland's communist government, the [[Soviet Union]], and ultimately [[communism]], which promoted [[atheism]].&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008" /&gt;

{{quote|"The Pope won that struggle by transcending politics. His was what Joseph Nye calls "soft power" – the power of attraction and repulsion. He began with an enormous advantage, and exploited it to the utmost: He headed the one institution that stood for the polar opposite of the Communist way of life that the Polish people hated. He was a Pole, but beyond the regime’s reach. By identifying with him, Poles would have the chance to cleanse themselves of the compromises they had to make to live under the regime. And so they came to him by the millions. They listened. He told them to be good, not to compromise themselves, to stick by one another, to be fearless, and that God is the only source of goodness, the only standard of conduct. "Be not afraid," he said. Millions shouted in response, "We want God! We want God! We want God!" The regime cowered. Had the Pope chosen to turn his soft power into the hard variety, the regime might have been drowned in blood. Instead, the Pope simply led the Polish people to desert their rulers by affirming solidarity with one another. The Communists managed to hold on as despots a decade longer. But as political leaders, they were finished." &lt;ref&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Besides the Pope's visit, American-government broadcasting and propaganda into Soviet-occupied Europe, particularly Poland, contributed to the rise of the [[Solidarity]] movement and to the collapse of the Soviet-backed governments there and in the rest of the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance.&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71"/&gt;

The United States and Europe have consistently been sources of influence and soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Joseph Nye|title=Europe’s Soft Power|url=http://www.theglobalist.com/europes-soft-power/|publisher=The Globalist|accessdate=30 July 2015|date=3 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European culture]]'s art, literature, music, design, fashion, and even food have been global magnets for some time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Europe and the U.S. have often claimed to support [[human rights]] and [[international law]] throughout the world.

Asia and more recently China have been working to use the potential soft power assets that are present in the admiration of their ancient cultures, arts, fashion and cuisine. China is presenting itself as a defender of national sovereignty,&lt;ref&gt;Friedberg, Aaron L. ''A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia'', New York: Norton Publishing, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; which became an issue after the [[NATO]] air campaign to oust Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and NATO's support of the rebels in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;Felgenhauer, Pavel.

''A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia'', New York: Norton Publishing, 2011. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Soft power extends beyond the operations of government, to the activities of the private sector and to society and culture at large.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Carnes, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power,"in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008) p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Soft power has gained more influence because it addresses the underlying dispositions of the people who have increasingly become more active in their governments.&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008" /&gt; This is true even in authoritarian countries where people and institutions are increasingly able to shape the debate.&lt;ref&gt;Defense Science Board, Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on Strategic Communication (Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, September 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[information age]] has also led to the rise of soft power resources for non-state actors, Primarily, through the use of global media, and to a greater extent the internet using tools such as the [[World Wide Web]], non-state actors have been able to increase their soft power and put pressure on governments that can ultimately affect policy outcomes. Instead of front organizations, non-state actors can create cyber advocacy organizations &lt;ref&gt;Steele, Robert D.

=== China ===
{{Main|Soft power of China}}
China's traditional culture has been a source of attraction, building on which it has created several hundred [[Confucius Institute]]s around the world to teach its language and culture. The enrollment of foreign students in China has increased from 36,000 a decade before to at least 240,000 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Nye Jr. Why China Is Weak on Soft Power; Jan, 17, 2012 https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/opinion/why-china-is-weak-on-soft-power.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; China's [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]] has attracted many western countries to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=With New Bank, China Shows U.S. It's Got Soft Power|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/23/with-new-bank-china-shows-u-s-its-got-soft-power/print/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=31 July 2015|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, China had the second largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A spring 2014 Global Attitudes survey from Pew Research Center states China receives mostly positive reviews in the sub-Saharan African nations polled, although South Africans are closely divided (45% favorable, 40% unfavorable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Opposition to U.S. Surveillance and Drones, but Limited Harm to America’s Image|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/chapter-2-chinas-image/|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  China's increasing soft power can be explained by looking at China's economic growth and regarding economic engagement with many African countries. China's expansion of trade and investment on the African continent and the spread of Chinese-led infrastructure projects gives positive impressions of China to people in Africa. China's economic engagement in African countries is considered as much more pragmatic and in consistency with the priorities of many African countries. Moreover, China's increasing role as a global superpower seems appealing and this drives a desire to tie African economies more closely to China's economy.

China has made a systematic effort to expand and give greater profile to its soft-power policies in Africa ever since the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2000. The commitments of China's soft power ranges from health, humanitarian assistance to academic, professional and cultural exchange. China's assistance to Africa, however, is not near the U.S. assistance in Africa.

Cultural exchange between China and Africa can be a representative example of how China has been spreading its soft power.
In 2005, the first Confucius Institute was established in Africa. The institute is funded by the Chinese government and it provides Chinese language and cultural programming to the public. There are 19 institutes today in Africa and China has planned to spend 20 million renminbi for education projects in South Africa, including the teaching of Mandarin in 50 local high schools.

Furthermore, there is an increasing support for cultural visitors programs which gained momentum in 2004 when the African Cultural Visitors Program was established. There is a rising number of African entrepreneurs who choose to move to China and there are also diaspora communities in many Chinese cities that have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer G. Cooke. China's soft power in Africa; {{cite web |url=http://www.relooney.fatcow.com/SI_Oil-Politics/Africa-China_54.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324122951/http://www.relooney.fatcow.com/SI_Oil-Politics/Africa-China_54.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of Africa, Chinese soft power extends to countries like [[Barbados]]. Barbadian Prime Minister [[David Thompson (Barbadian politician)|David Thompson]] expressed admiration for the Chinese economic model and sought to emulate the way Chinese state controlled banks guided development.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/cable/2009/03/09BRIDGETOWN144.html# Wikileaks 09Barbados144]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
[[France]] has long exerted a great amount of soft power. The country and [[French culture|its culture]] have for centuries been admired in many parts of the world; so much so that [[Thomas Jefferson]] is famously quoted as saying "Every man has two countries, his own and France."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://france.usembassy.gov/us-france-americans.html|title=Americans in France|publisher=[[U.S. Embassy Paris]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418070413/http://france.usembassy.gov/us-france-americans.html|archivedate=2015-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very term "culture" comes from France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/39149-french-culture.html French Culture: Customs &amp; Traditions], [[LiveScience]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, France had the third largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

France was a focal point of the [[Age of Enlightenment]];&lt;ref&gt;"Enlightenment thought culminates historically in the political upheaval of the French Revolution, in which the traditional hierarchical political and social orders (the French monarchy, the privileges of the French nobility, the political power and authority of the Catholic Church) were violently destroyed and replaced by a political and social order informed by the Enlightenment ideals of freedom and equality for all, founded, ostensibly, upon principles of human reason." [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/ Enlightenment], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; its attachment to the ideals of [[liberty]], [[Social equality|equality]], [[Toleration|tolerance]] and [[reason]] was notably embodied in the writing and publishing of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. The [[French Revolution]] was one of the most significant events in European and world history. France has since then been instrumental in spreading [[Republicanism in France|Republican ideals]]. The [[Napoleonic Code]], which influenced much of the rest of Europe and beyond, is regarded as one of the most important law document of the [[modern era]].&lt;ref name="Robert B. Holtman 1981"&gt;Robert B. Holtman, ''The Napoleonic Revolution'' (Baton Rouge: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French language]] has for centuries been an important diplomatic language. For example, French has to be used  &amp;ndash; on par with English &amp;ndash; for all documents issued by the [[United Nations Treaty Series]], ensuring that all UN treaties are equally valid in their English and French versions.&lt;ref&gt;"Treaties registered with the United Nations Treaty Series are always translated into French and English. Documents are always provided in French and English. This city’s Geneva Conventions, written in equally authentic French and English versions, laid part of the groundwork for the international system." [https://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/04/languages-diplomacy Languages of diplomacy - Towards a fairer distribution], [[The Economist]]&lt;/ref&gt;

France has also followed for decades a very active diplomatic and cultural policy. The ''[[Alliance Française]]'', whose aim is to promote the French language and French culture, was created as early as [[1883]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alliancefr.org/en/who-are-we |title=Who are we? |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120094935/http://www.alliancefr.org/en/who-are-we |archive-date=2015-11-20 |publisher=[[Alliance Française]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]'''s 2015 "Soft Power 30" report, France was ranked first in the "engagement" criteria, which is intended to measure "the reach of states’ diplomatic network and their commitment to major challenges like development and the environment." ''Monocle'' further noted that "In terms of influential reach, France is the best networked state in the world and is member of more multi-lateral organisations than any other country." Overall, France ranked fourth in that study.&lt;ref name="francemonocle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Report_Final-published.pdf |title=The Soft Power 30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120204008/http://www.comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Report_Final-published.pdf |archive-date=2015-11-20 |publisher=[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France's [[laïcité]], [[secularism]], policy has inspired some countries over time. For instance, France was [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]]'s main role model for [[Westernization]] as part of the major reform efforts that he spearheaded when he was President of [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Soner Cagaptay, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V8vQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=french+laicit%C3%A9+turkey&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Gz_UaAWfWN&amp;sig=NAEle23Sl5HmUbOS2mjT-NnAl0U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA45fHrbXJAhXH8RQKHfvKAIwQ6AEIWzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=french%20laicit%C3%A9%20turkey&amp;f=false The Rise of Turkey: The Twenty-First Century's First Muslim Power], pp. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
The annual soft power rankings by ''Monocle'' magazine and the Institute for Government ranks 30 countries which “best attract favor from other nations through culture, sport, cuisine, design, diplomacy and beyond.”
''Monocle'' magazine said: “[[Angela Merkel|Merkel]] may be painted as a stern taskmaster but it seems she has a softer side, or the country she leads does.”
It said Germany’s rise as a soft power should not come as a surprise.
“The country is traditionally excellent at pursuing its ideas, values and aims using diplomatic, cultural and economic tools," it said. “By quietly doing the simple things well it is a country that has become a global power and the rest of us can feel comfortable with that.”
Germans had been understandably wary about depicting a dominant image abroad, the magazine added, but it said that the country’s rise should not make everyone else feel uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Germany tops world 'soft power' rankings; http://www.thelocal.de/20131121/germany-number-one-for-soft-power&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerhard Schröder: 'Germany Can Only Lead Europe the Way Porcupines Mate'|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/interview-former-german-chancellor-gerhard-schroeder-on-foreign-policy-a-891839.html|publisher=Spiegel Online International|accessdate=30 July 2015|date=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama sets off on farewell trip to Europe in shadow of president-elect|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/barack-obama-faces-awkward-task-on-sad-farewell-visit-to-europe|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=Reuters|date=14 November 2016|quote=As the Americans see it, Merkel – and certainly not the vainglorious European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker – runs the EU.

=== Italy ===
The famous elements of Italian soft culture are its art, music, fashion, and iconic food. Italy was the birthplace of [[opera]],&lt;ref&gt;Kimbell, David R. B.

Web. 22 Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and for generations the language of opera was [[Italian language|Italian]], irrespective of the nationality of the composer. Popular tastes in drama in Italy have long favored comedy; the improvisational style known as the ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'' began in Italy in the mid-16th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=it |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/commedia-dell-arte/ |title=Commedia dell'arte |work=Treccani, il portale del sapere |access-date=24 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still performed today. Before being exported to France, the famous [[Ballet]] dance genre also originated in Italy.
The country boasts several world-famous cities. [[Rome]] was the ancient capital of the Roman Empire and seat of the [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. [[Florence]] was the heart of the [[Renaissance]], a period of great achievements in [[the arts]] that ended the Dark Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Zirpolo, Lilian H.

Web. 16 Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important cities include [[Turin]], which used to be the capital of Italy, and is now one of the world's great centers of automobile engineering. [[Milan]] is a  [[fashion capital]] of the World. [[Venice]], with its intricate canal system, attracts tourists from all over the world especially during the [[Venetian Carnival]] and the [[Biennale]].

In a 2002 article in the journal ''Foreign Policy'' titled “Japan’s Gross National Cool”, Douglas McGray wrote of Japan “reinventing superpower” as its cultural influence expanded internationally despite the economic and political problems of the “lost decade.” Surveying youth culture and the role of J-pop, manga, anime, fashion, film, consumer electronics, architecture, and cuisine, McGray highlighted Japan’s considerable soft power, posing the question of what message the country might project. He also argued that Japan’s recession may even have boosted its national cool, due to the partial discrediting of erstwhile rigid social hierarchies and big-business career paths.&lt;ref name="McGray"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douglasmcgray.com/cool-japan.html |title=Japan's Gross National Cool |author=McGray, Douglas |publisher=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=1 May 2002 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2002/05/01/japans_gross_national_cool |title=Japan's Gross National Cool |url-access=subscription |author=McGray, Douglas |publisher=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=1 May 2002 |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Japan had the fifth largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"'''Hallyu'''", also known as the "'''Korean Wave'''", is a [[neologism]] referring to the spread of South Korean culture since the late 1990s.

In 2012, the [[BBC]]'s country rating poll revealed that public opinion of [[South Korea]] has been improving every year since the first rating poll for the country was conducted in 2009. In several countries such as [[Russia]], [[India]], [[China]] and [[France]], public opinion of South Korea turned from slightly negative to generally positive. The report cited culture and tradition as among the most important factors contributing to positive perceptions of South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 BBC Country Ratings|url=http://www.globescan.com/images/images/pressreleases/bbc2012_country_ratings/2012_bbc_country%20rating%20final%20080512.pdf|publisher=Globescan/BBC World Service|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes alongside a rapid growth in the total value of cultural exports which rose to US$4.2 billion in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver|first=Christian|title=South Korea's K-pop takes off in the west|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ddf11662-53c7-11e1-9eac-00144feabdc0.html|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First driven by the spread of [[Korean drama]]s televised across [[East Asia|East]], [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] during its initial stages, the ''Korean Wave'' evolved from a regional development into a global phenomenon due to the proliferation of Korean pop ([[K-pop]]) music videos on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Yoon, Lina.

=== United States ===
The [[United States]] has long had a great deal of soft power. Examples include [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[four freedoms]] in Europe at the end of [[World War II]], young people behind the [[Iron Curtain]] listening to the government's foreign propaganda arm [[Radio Free Europe]], Chinese students symbolizing their protests in [[Tiananmen Square]] by creating a replica of the [[Statue of Liberty]] that they called "Goddess of Democracy", newly liberated Afghans in 2001 asking for a copy of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and young Iranians today surreptitiously watching banned American videos and satellite television broadcasts in the privacy of their homes.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X" /&gt; America's early commitment to religious toleration, for example, was a powerful element of its overall appeal to potential immigrants; and American aid in the reconstruction of Europe after World War II was a propaganda victory to show off the prosperity and the generosity of the people of the United States.

Studies of American broadcasting into the [[Soviet bloc]], and testimonials from Czech President [[Václav Havel]], Polish President [[Lech Wałęsa]], and Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] support that soft power efforts of the United States and its allies during the Cold War were ultimately successful in creating the favorable conditions that led to the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Carnes Lord, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"Satellite TV is actively promoting American soft power in the Arab world in ways that the United States has been incapable of doing. The launch of the Arabic-language [[Alhurra]] satellite channel in early 2004 to provide news and entertainment in ways more beneficial to the U.S., marked an important turning point in U.S. public diplomacy development. Though it calls itself the largest Arabic-language news organization in the world, the Virginia-based Alhurra lacks the cachet and brand recognition of Al Jazeera, but its balanced presentation of news has earned it a small but significant viewership. Controversial innovations in radio broadcasting that target young mass audiences through a mix of light news and mild American popular music – [[Radio Sawa]] in [[Arabic]] and [[Radio Farda]] in [[Persian language|Persian]] – have captured a substantial market share in their target regions."&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71" /&gt;

A '''student fee''' is a [[fee]] charged to students at a school, college, university or other place of learning that is in addition to any [[matriculation]] and/or [[Tuition payments|tuition fee]]s. It may be charged to support [[student organization]]s and [[student activities]] (for which it can be called an '''activity fee''') or for [[:wikt:intercollegiate|intercollegiate]] programs such as [[intramural sports]] or [[Visiting scholar|visiting academic]]s; or, at a [[public university]] or college, as a means to remedy shortfalls in [[Subsidy|state funding]] (in which case it can often be called a '''technology fee'''). Further fees may then be charged for features and facilities such as insurance, health and parking provision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24314">In [[sociology]], '''taste''' is an individual's personal and cultural patterns of choice and preference. Taste is drawing distinctions between things such as [[Fashion|style]]s, [[Etiquette|manners]], [[Final good|consumer goods]], and works of [[art]] and relating to these. Social inquiry of taste is about the human ability to judge what is beautiful, good, and proper.

Social and cultural phenomena concerning taste are closely associated to social relations and dynamics between people. The concept of social taste is therefore rarely separated from its accompanying sociological concepts. An understanding of taste as something that is expressed in actions between people helps to perceive many social phenomena that would otherwise be inconceivable.

Aesthetic preferences and attendance to various cultural events are associated with education and social origin. Different socioeconomic groups are likely to have different tastes. Social class is one of the prominent factors structuring taste.

== Aesthetics ==

The concept of [[aesthetics]] has been the interest of philosophers such as [[Plato]], [[David Hume|Hume]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], who understood aesthetics as something pure and searched the essence of beauty, or, ''the ontology of aesthetics''. But it was not before the beginning of the [[cultural sociology]] of early 19th century that the question was problematized in its social context, which took the differences and changes in historical view as an important process of aesthetical thought.&lt;ref&gt;Outwaite &amp; Bottonmore 1996, p 662&lt;/ref&gt; Although Immanuel Kant's ''[[Critique of Judgement]]'' (1790) did formulate a [[Aesthetic relativism|non-relativistic]] idea of aesthetical [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]], where both personal pleasure and pure beauty coexisted, it was concepts such as [[Social class|class]] taste that began the attempt to find essentially [[Sociology|sociological]] answers to the problem of taste and aesthetics. Metaphysical or spiritual interpretations of common aesthetical values have shifted towards locating social groups that form the contemporary [[art]]istic taste or [[fashion]].

[[File:Immanuel Kant.jpg|right|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] also followed the fashion of his contemporaries.]]
In his aesthetic philosophy, Kant denies any standard of a good taste, which would be the taste of the majority or any social group. For Kant, beauty is not a property of any object, but an aesthetic judgement based on a subjective feeling. He claims that a genuine good taste does exist, though it could not be [[empirical]]ly identified. Good taste cannot be found in any standards or generalizations, and the [[Validity (logic)|valid]]ity of a judgement is not the general view of  the majority or some specific social group. Taste is both personal and beyond reasoning, and therefore disputing over matters of taste never reaches any universality. Kant stresses that our preferences, even on generally liked things, do not justify our judgements.&lt;ref&gt;Gronow 1997, pp. 11, 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Every judgement of taste, according to Kant, presumes the existence of a ''[[sensus communis]]'', a consensus of taste. This non-existent consensus is an idea that both enables judgements of taste and is constituted by a somewhat conceptual common spiritual humanity. A judgement does not take for granted that everyone agrees with it, but it proposes the community to share the experience. If the statement would not be addressed to this community, it is not a genuine subjective judgement. Kant's idea of good taste excludes fashion, which can be understood only in its empirical form, and has no connection with the harmony of ideal consensus. There is a proposition of a universal communal voice in judgements of taste, which calls for a shared feeling among the others.&lt;ref&gt;Gronow 1997, pp. 88-90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] argued against Kantian view of pure aesthetics, stating that the legitimate taste of the society is the taste of the ruling class. This position also rejects the idea of genuine good taste, as the legitimate taste is merely a class taste. This idea was also proposed by [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], who noted that the upper classes abandon fashions as they are adopted by lower ones.

Fashion in a Kantian sense is an aesthetic phenomenon and source of pleasure. For Kant, the function of fashion was merely a means of social distinction, and he excluded fashion from pure aesthetics because of its content's arbitrary nature. Simmel, following Kantian thought, recognises the usefulness of fashionable objects in its social context. For him, the function lies in the whole fashion pattern, and cannot be attributed to any single object. Fashion, for Simmel, is a tool of individuation, social distinction, and even class distinction, which are neither [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] or aesthetical criteria. Still, both Kant and Simmel agreed that staying out of fashion would be pointless.&lt;ref&gt;Gronow 1997, p 83&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taste high life.jpg|thumb|left|240px|''Taste in High Life'', original painting 1742, [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]] engraving 1746]]

Taste and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] are closely linked together; taste as a preference of certain types of clothing, food and other [[Commodity|commodities]] directly affects the consumer choices at the market. The causal link between taste and consumption is however more complicated than a direct chain of events in which taste creates demand that, in turn, creates supply. There are many scientific approaches to taste, specifically within the fields of [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]].

=== Mechanics ===

Definition of consumption in its classical economical context can be summed up in the saying "[[Say's law|supply creates its own demand]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ekelund &amp; Hébert 1990, pp. 154-157&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, consumption is created by and equates itself to production of market goods. This definition, however, is not adequate to accommodate any theory that tries to describe the link between taste and consumption.

A more complex economic model for taste and consumption was proposed by economist [[Thorstein Veblen]]. He challenged the simple conception of man as plain consumer of his utmost necessities, and suggested that the study of the formation of tastes and consumption patterns was essential for economics. Veblen did not disregard the importance of the demand for an economic system, but rather insisted on rejection of the principle of [[Utilitarism|utility-maximization]].&lt;ref name='Veblen'&gt;Ekelund &amp; Hébert 1990, p 462&lt;/ref&gt; The classical economics conception of supply and demand must be therefore extended to accommodate a type of social interaction that is not immanent in the economics paradigm.

Veblen understood man as a creature with a strong [[instinct]] to [[Imitation|emulate]] others to survive. As social status is in many cases at least partially based on or represented by one's property, men tend to try and match their acquisitions with those who are higher in a [[Social class|social hierarchy]].&lt;ref name='Veblen'/&gt; In terms of taste and modern consumption this means that taste forms in a process of emulation: people emulate each other, which creates certain habits and preferences, which in turn contributes to consumption of certain preferred goods.

Veblen's [[The Theory of the Leisure Class|main argument]] concerned what he called ''leisure class'', and it explicates the mechanism between taste, acquisition and consumption. He took his thesis of taste as an economic factor and merged it with the neoclassical hypothesis of nonsatiety, which states that no man can ever be satisfied with his fortune. Hence, those who can afford luxuries are bound to be in a better social situation than others, because acquisition of luxuries by definition grants a good social status. This creates a demand for certain leisure goods, that are not necessities, but that, because of the current taste of the most well off, become wanted commodities.&lt;ref&gt;Ekelund &amp; Hébert 1990, p 463&lt;/ref&gt;

In different periods of time, consumption and its societal functions have varied. In [[Tudor period|14th century England]] consumption had significant political element.&lt;ref name='McCracken'&gt;McCracken 1990&lt;/ref&gt; By creating an expensive luxurious aristocratic taste [[Kingdom of England|the Monarchy]] could legitimize itself in high status, and, according to the mechanism of taste and consumption, by mimicking the taste of the Royal the nobility competed for high social position. The aristocratic scheme of consumption came to an end, when [[industrialization]] made the rotation of commodities faster and prices lower, and the luxuries of the previous times became less and less indicator of social status. As production and consumption of commodities became a scale bigger, people could afford to choose from different commodities. This provided for [[fashion]] to be created in market.&lt;ref name='McCracken'/&gt;

The era of [[mass consumption]] marks yet another new kind of consumption and taste pattern. Beginning from the 18th century, this period can be characterized by increase in consumption and birth of fashion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bragg|25 October 2007 |loc=Taste}}&lt;/ref&gt; that cannot be accurately explained only by social status. More than establishing their class, people acquired goods just to consume [[Hedonism|hedonistically]].&lt;ref&gt;Gronow 1997, pp. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1989&lt;/ref&gt; This means, that the consumer is never satisfied, but constantly seeks out novelties and tries to satisfy insatiable urge to consume.

In above taste has been seen as something that presupposes consumption, as something that exists before consumer choices. In other words, taste is seen as an attribute or property of a consumer or a social group. Alternative view critical to the attributative taste suggests that taste doesn't exist in itself as an attribute or a property, but instead is an activity in itself.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hennion 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] conception of taste derives its critical momentum from the fact that individual tastes can not be observed in themselves, but rather that only physical acts can. Building on Hennion, Arsel and Bean &lt;ref&gt;Arsel &amp; Bean 2013&lt;/ref&gt; suggest a practice-theory approach to understanding taste.

=== Critical perspectives ===

Consumption, especially mass consumerism has been criticized from various philosophical, cultural and political directions. Consumption has been described as [[Anti-consumerism|overly conspicuous]] or [[Environmentalism|environmentally untenable]], and also a sign of bad taste.

Many critics have voiced their opinion against the growing influence of [[mass culture]], fearing the decline in global divergence of culture. For example, [[McDonald's]] has been seen as a monument to the cultural imperialism of [[Western world|the West]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[McDonaldization]] is a term used to describe the practice among fast food companies of extending their franchise worldwide, causing smaller ethnic enterprises and food cultures to disappear.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} It is claimed that the convenience of getting the same hamburger can reduce consumers interest in traditional culinary experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western culture of consumerism has been criticized{{according to whom|date=July 2012}} for its uniformity. The critics argue, that while the culture industry promises consumers new experiences and adventures, people in fact are fed the same pattern of swift but temporary fulfillment. Here taste, it is suggested, is used as a means of repression; as something that is given from above, or from the industry of the mass culture, to people who are devoid of contentual and extensive ideologies and of will.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno &amp; Horkheimer 1982, pp. 120–167.&lt;/ref&gt; This critique insists that the popular Western culture does not fill people with aesthetic and cultural satisfaction.

== Social classes ==

Arguably, the question of taste is in many ways related to the underlying [[Social class|social divisions]] of community. There is likely to be variation between groups of different socioeconomic status in preferences for cultural practices and goods, to the extent that it is often possible to identify particular types of class taste.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu1984"&gt;Bourdieu 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Also, within many theories concerning taste, class dynamics is understood as one of the principal mechanisms structuring taste and the ideas of [[sophistication]] and [[vulgarity]].

=== Imitation and distinction ===

Sociologists suggest that people disclose much about their positions in [[Social hierarchy|social hierarchies]] by how their everyday choices reveal their tastes. That is preference for certain consumer goods, appearances, manners etc. may signal status because it is perceived as part of the [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] of high-status groups. But, it is further argued, not just that patterns of taste are determined by class structure. because people may also strategically employ distinctions of taste as resources in maintaining and redefining their [[social status]].&lt;ref&gt;Slater 1997, pp. 153, 156&lt;/ref&gt;

When taste is explained on account of its functions for status competition, interpretations are often built on the model of [[Imitation|social emulation]]. It is assumed, firstly, that people desire to distinguish themselves from those with lower status in the [[social hierarchy]] and, secondly, that people will imitate those in higher positions.&lt;ref&gt;Slater 1997, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

The German sociologist [[Georg Simmel]] (1858–1918) examined the phenomenon of [[fashion]] - as manifested in rapidly changing patterns of taste. According to Simmel, fashion is a vehicle for strengthening the unity of the social classes and for making them distinct. Members of the [[upper class]]es tend to signal their superiority, and they act as the initiators of new trends. But upper-class taste is soon imitated by the [[middle class]]es. As goods, appearances, manners etc. conceived as high-class status markers become popular enough, they lose their function to differentiate. So the upper classes have to originate yet more stylistic innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Simmel 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

The particular taste of the upper classes has been further analyzed by an economist [[Thorsten Veblen]] (1857–1929). He argues that distancing oneself from hardships of productive [[Manual labour|labour]] has always been the conclusive sign of high social status. Hence, upper-class taste is not defined by things regarded as necessary or useful but by those that are the opposite. To demonstrate non-productivity, members of the so-called [[The Theory of the Leisure Class|leisure class]] waste conspicuously both [[Conspicuous leisure|time]] and [[Conspicuous consumption|goods]]. The lower social stratum try their best to imitate the non-productive lifestyle of the upper classes, even though they do not really have means for catching up.&lt;ref&gt;Slater 1997, pp. 154–155&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most widely referenced theories of class-based tastes was coined by the French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (1930–2002), who asserted that tastes of social classes are structured on basis of assessments concerning possibilities and constraints of [[social action]]. Some choices are not equally possible for everyone. The constraints are not simply because members of different classes have varying amounts of economic resources at their disposal. Bourdieu argued that there are also significant non-economic resources and their distribution effects [[social stratification]] and [[Social inequality|inequality]]. One such resource is [[cultural capital]], which is acquired mainly through education and social origin. It consists of accumulated knowledge and competence for making cultural distinctions. To possess cultural capital is a potential advantage for social action, providing access to education credentials, occupations and social affiliation.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu1984" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

By assessing relationships between consumption patterns and the distribution of economic and cultural capital, Bourdieu identified distinct class tastes within French society of the 1960s. Upper-class taste is characterized by refined and subtle distinctions, and it places intrinsic value on aesthetic experience. This particular kind of taste was appreciated as the [[Legitimation|legitimate]] basis for "good taste" in French society, acknowledged by the other classes as well. Consequently, members of the middle classes appeared to practice "cultural goodwill" in emulating the high-class manners and lifestyles. The taste of the middle classes is not defined as much by authentic appreciation for aesthetics as by a desire to compete in social status. In contrast, the popular taste of the working classes is defined by an imperative for "choosing the necessary". Not much importance is placed on aesthetics. This may be because of actual material deprivation excluding anything but the necessary but, also, because of a [[Habit (psychology)|habit]], formed by collective class experiences.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu1984" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater 1997, pp. 159–163&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of class-based theories ===

Theories of taste which build on the ideas of status competition and social emulation have been criticized from various standpoints. Firstly, it has been suggested that it is not reasonable to trace all social action back to status competition. That is while marking and claiming status are strong incentives, people also have other motivations as well. Secondly, it has been argued that it not plausible to assume that tastes and lifestyles are always [[Trickle-down effect|diffusing downwards]] from the upper classes. and that in some situations the diffusion of tastes may move in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;Slater 1997, pp. 157–158&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that the association between social class and taste is no longer quite as strong as it used to be. For instance, theorists of the [[Frankfurt School]] have claimed that the diffusion of [[Popular culture|mass cultural products]] has obscured class differences in capitalist societies. That is that products consumed passively by members of different social classes are virtually all the same, with only superficial differences regarding to brand and genre. Other criticism has concentrated on the declassifying effects of [[Postmodernity|postmodern culture]]; that consumer tastes are now less influenced by traditional social structures, and they engage in play with free-floating signifiers to perpetually redefine themselves with whatever they find pleasurable.&lt;ref name="Holt 1998, p. 21"&gt;Holt 1998, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holt 1998, p. 21"/&gt;

== Bad taste ==

"Bad taste" (also poor taste or vulgarity) is generally a title given to any object or idea that does not fall within a person's idea of the normal social standards of the time or area. Varying from society to society and from time to time, bad taste is generally thought of as a negative thing, but also changes with each individual.&lt;ref&gt;
Theodore A. Gracyk, "Having Bad Taste", ''The British Journal of Aesthetics, Volume 30'', Issue 2, 1 April 1990, Pages 117–131, https://doi.org/10.1093/bjaesthetics/30.2.117
Published: 01 April 1990. [https://academic.oup.com/bjaesthetics/article-abstract/30/2/117/227988?redirectedFrom=PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary view is that "a good deal of dramatic verse written during the [[Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] periods is in poor taste because it is bombast" or high-sounding language with little meaning.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, "Vulgarity''. Dictionary of Literary Terms&lt; and Literary Theory'' (1977),Penguin, 1998, p.976.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodore Robert Bundy''' (born '''Theodore Robert Cowell'''; November 24, 1946&amp;nbsp;– January 24, 1989) was an American [[serial killer]], [[kidnapping|kidnapper]], [[Rape|rapist]], [[Burglary|burglar]], and [[Necrophilia|necrophile]] who assaulted and murdered numerous young women and girls during the 1970s and possibly earlier. Shortly before his execution and after more than a decade of denials, he confessed to 30 homicides that he committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978. The true number of victims is unknown and possibly higher.

Many of Bundy's young female victims regarded him as handsome and charismatic, which were traits that he exploited to win their trust. He would typically approach them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes for hours at a time, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until [[putrefaction]] and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He [[Decapitation|decapitated]] at least 12 of his victims, and for a period of time, he kept some of the severed heads as mementos in his apartment.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=378, 393}} On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.

In 1975, Bundy was jailed for the first time when he was incarcerated in [[Utah]] for aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault. He then became a suspect in a progressively longer list of unsolved homicides in multiple states. Facing murder charges in [[Colorado]], he engineered two dramatic escapes and committed further assaults, including three murders, before his ultimate recapture in [[Florida]] in 1978. For the Florida homicides, he received three death sentences in two separate trials.

Bundy was executed in the [[electric chair]] at [[Florida State Prison]] on January 24, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Barry|last1=Bearak|title=Bundy Electrocuted After Night of Weeping, Praying : 500 Cheer Death of Murderer|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-24/news/mn-1075_1_ted-bundy|accessdate=July 16, 2016|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=January 24, 1989|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160718145205/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-24/news/mn-1075_1_ted-bundy|archivedate=July 18, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Ann Rule]] described Bundy as "a sadistic [[sociopath]] who took pleasure from another human's pain and the control he had over his victims, to the point of death, and even after".{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=xiv}} He once called himself "the most cold-hearted son of a bitch you'll ever meet";{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=263}}&lt;ref name="Hare1999" /&gt; Attorney [[Polly Nelson]]—a member of his last defense team—wrote: "Ted was the very definition of heartless evil."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=319}}

== Early life ==

=== Childhood ===
Bundy was born Theodore Robert Cowell on November 24, 1946, to Eleanor Louise Cowell (known for most of her life as Louise) at the Elizabeth Lund Home for Unwed Mothers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lundvt.org/ Lund Family Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307150638/https://lundvt.org/ |date=March 7, 2017 }}, retrieved September 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Burlington, Vermont]]. His father's identity was never determined with any degree of certainty. His birth certificate assigned paternity to a salesman and [[Air Force]] veteran named Lloyd Marshall,{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=8}} but Louise later claimed that she had been seduced by "a sailor"{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=xxxiii}} whose name may have been Jack Worthington.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=56, 330}} Years later, investigators would find no record of anyone by that name in [[United States Navy|Navy]] or [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] archives.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|p=308}} Some family members expressed suspicions that Bundy might have been fathered by Louise's own violent, abusive father, Samuel Cowell,{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=56}} but no material evidence has ever been cited to support or refute this.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=xxxiv}}

For the first three years of his life, Bundy lived in the [[Philadelphia]] home of his maternal grandparents, Samuel and Eleanor Cowell, who raised him as their son to avoid the social stigma that accompanied birth outside of wedlock at the time. Family, friends, and even young Ted were told that his grandparents were his parents and that his mother was his older sister. He eventually discovered the truth, although he had varied recollections of the circumstances. He told a girlfriend that a cousin showed him a copy of his birth certificate after calling him a "bastard",{{sfn|Kendall|1981|pp=40–41}} but he told biographers Stephen Michaud and [[Hugh Aynesworth]] that he found the certificate himself.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=62}} Biographer and [[true crime]] writer [[Ann Rule]], who knew Bundy personally, believed that he did not find out until 1969, when he located his original birth record in Vermont.{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=16–17}} Bundy expressed a lifelong resentment toward his mother for never talking to him about his real father, and for leaving him to discover his true parentage for himself.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=51–52}}

In some interviews, Bundy spoke warmly of his grandparents {{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=17–18}} and told Rule that he "identified with", "respected", and "clung to" his grandfather.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=9}} In 1987, however, he and other family members told attorneys that Samuel Cowell was a tyrannical bully and a bigot who hated blacks, Italians, Catholics, and Jews. Bundy's grandfather beat his wife and the family dog and swung neighborhood cats by their tails. He once threw Louise's younger sister Julia down a flight of stairs for oversleeping.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=330}} He sometimes spoke aloud to unseen presences,{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=154}} and at least once he flew into a violent rage when the question of Ted's paternity was raised.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=330}} Bundy described his grandmother as a timid and obedient woman who periodically underwent [[electroconvulsive therapy]] for depression{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=154}} and feared to leave their house toward the end of her life.{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=501–08}} Ted occasionally exhibited disturbing behavior, even at that early age. Julia recalled awakening one day from a nap to find herself surrounded by knives from the Cowell kitchen; her three-year-old nephew was standing by the bed, smiling.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=505}}

In 1950, Louise abruptly changed her surname from Cowell to Nelson,{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=8}} and at the urging of multiple family members, she left Philadelphia with her son to live with cousins Alan and Jane Scott in [[Tacoma, Washington]].{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=155}} In 1951 Louise met Johnny Culpepper Bundy, a hospital cook, at an adult singles night at Tacoma's First Methodist Church.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=57}} They married later that year and Johnny Bundy formally adopted Ted.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=57}} Johnny and Louise conceived four children of their own, and although Johnny tried to include his adoptive son in camping trips and other family activities, Ted remained distant. He later complained to his girlfriend that Johnny wasn't his real father, "wasn't very bright", and "didn't make much money."{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=51}}

Bundy had different recollections of Tacoma when he spoke to his biographers. When he talked to Michaud and Aynesworth, he described how he roamed his neighborhood, picking through trash barrels in search of pictures of naked women.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=22}} When he spoke to Polly Nelson, he explained how he perused detective magazines, crime novels, and true crime documentaries for stories that involved sexual violence, particularly when the stories were illustrated with pictures of dead or maimed bodies.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=277–78}} In a letter to Rule, he asserted that he "never, ever read fact-detective magazines, and shuddered at the thought [that anyone would]".{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=612}} In his conversation with Michaud, he described how he would consume large quantities of alcohol and "canvass the community" late at night in search of undraped windows where he could observe women undressing, or "whatever [else] could be seen."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=74–77}}

Bundy also varied the accounts of his social life. He told Michaud and Aynesworth that he "chose to be alone" as an adolescent because he was unable to understand interpersonal relationships.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=64}} He claimed that he had no natural sense of how to develop friendships. "I didn't know what made people want to be friends," he said. "I didn't know what underlay social interactions."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=66}} Classmates from [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Tacoma, Washington)|Woodrow Wilson High School]] told Rule, however, that Bundy was "well known and well liked" there, "a medium-sized fish in a large pond".{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=13}}

Snow skiing was Bundy's only significant athletic avocation; he enthusiastically pursued the activity by using stolen equipment and forged lift tickets.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=62}}

During high school, he was arrested at least twice on suspicion of burglary and auto theft. When he reached age 18, the details of the incidents were expunged from his record, which is customary in Washington State and most other states.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=13–14}}

=== University years ===
After graduating from high school in 1965, Bundy spent a year at the [[University of Puget Sound]] (UPS) before he transferred to the [[University of Washington]] (UW) in 1966 to study Chinese.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=14}} In 1967, he became romantically involved with a UW classmate who is identified by several pseudonyms in Bundy biographies, most commonly Stephanie Brooks.&lt;ref name="akaLeslieHolland" /&gt; In early 1968 he dropped out of college and worked at a series of minimum-wage jobs. He also volunteered at the Seattle office of [[Nelson Rockefeller]]'s presidential campaign&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; and in August attended the [[1968 Republican National Convention]] in [[Miami]] as a Rockefeller delegate.{{sfn|Larsen|1980|pp=5, 7}} Shortly thereafter Brooks ended their relationship and returned to her family home in California, frustrated by what she described as Bundy's immaturity and lack of ambition. Psychiatrist [[Dorothy Otnow Lewis|Dorothy Lewis]] would later pinpoint this crisis as "probably the pivotal time in his development".{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=279}} Devastated by Brooks's rejection, Bundy traveled to Colorado and then farther east, visiting relatives in [[Arkansas]] and Philadelphia and enrolling for one semester at [[Temple University]].{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=19}} It was at this time in early 1969, Rule believes, that Bundy visited the office of birth records in Burlington and confirmed his true parentage.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=19}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=53}}

Bundy was back in Washington in the fall of 1969 when he met Elizabeth Kloepfer (identified in Bundy literature as Meg Anders, Beth Archer, or Liz Kendall), a divorcée from [[Ogden, Utah]]. She worked as a secretary at the University of Washington School of Medicine.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=74}} Their stormy relationship would continue well past his initial incarceration in Utah in 1976.

In mid-1970, Bundy was now focused and goal oriented, and he re-enrolled at UW, this time as a psychology major. He became an honor student and was well regarded by his professors.{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=18–20}} In 1971, he took a job at Seattle's Suicide Hotline Crisis Center, where he met and worked alongside Ann Rule. Rule was a former Seattle police officer and aspiring crime writer who would later write one of the definitive Bundy biographies, ''[[The Stranger Beside Me]]''. She saw nothing disturbing in Bundy's personality at the time and described him as "kind, solicitous, and empathetic".{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=22–33}}

After graduating from UW in 1972,{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=76}} Bundy joined Governor [[Daniel J. Evans]]' re-election campaign.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=39}} Posing as a college student, he shadowed Evans' opponent, former governor [[Albert Rosellini]], and recorded his stump speeches for analysis by Evans' team.{{sfn|Larsen|1980|pp=7–10}}&lt;ref name="Ellensburg1973-08-30" /&gt; After Evans was re-elected, Bundy was hired as an assistant to Ross Davis, Chairman of the [[Washington State Republican Party]]. Davis thought well of Bundy and described him as "smart, aggressive&amp;nbsp;... and a believer in the system".{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=46}} In early 1973, Bundy was accepted into the law schools of UPS and the [[S.J. Quinney College of Law|University of Utah]] despite mediocre [[Law School Admission Test]] scores. He got in on the strength of letters of recommendation from Evans, Davis, and several UW psychology professors.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=22, 43–44}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=79}}

During a trip to California on Republican Party business in the summer of 1973, Bundy rekindled his relationship with Brooks, who marveled at his transformation into a serious, dedicated professional who was seemingly on the cusp of a distinguished legal and political career. He continued to date Kloepfer as well, and neither woman was aware of the other's existence. In the fall of 1973, Bundy [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at UPS Law School{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=45–46}} and continued courting Brooks, who flew to Seattle several times to stay with him. They discussed marriage; at one point he introduced her to Davis as his fiancée.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=51}} In January 1974, however, he abruptly broke off all contact; her phone calls and letters went unreturned. Finally reaching him by phone a month later, Brooks demanded to know why Bundy had unilaterally ended their relationship without explanation. In a flat, calm voice, he replied, "Stephanie, I have no idea what you mean" and hung up. She never heard from him again.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=52}}  He later explained, "I just wanted to prove to myself that I could have married her";{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=16}} but Brooks concluded in retrospect that he had deliberately planned the entire courtship and rejection in advance as vengeance for the breakup she initiated in 1968.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=52}}

By then, Bundy had begun skipping classes at law school; by April, he had stopped attending entirely,{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=44–47}} as young women began to disappear in the [[Pacific Northwest]].{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=81–84}} The year the murders began, he was the assistant director of the Seattle Crime Prevention Advisory Commission and wrote a pamphlet for women on rape prevention.&lt;ref name="nyt 1989"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jon|last=Nordheimer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/25/us/bundy-is-put-to-death-in-florida-after-admitting-trail-of-killings.html|title=Bundy Is Put to Death in Florida After Admitting Trail of Killings|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=January 25, 1989|accessdate=September 7, 2018|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022194108/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/25/us/bundy-is-put-to-death-in-florida-after-admitting-trail-of-killings.html |archive-date=October 22, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bundy joked with local newsmen that after his eight weeks in Salt Lake City’s jail system, before being released on bail, he had a beneficial experience for studying the law, thus giving him new insights for improving the criminal justice system. His first order of action was to focus on addressing the bail‐bond system and improving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert |last1=Keller |title=Bundy: Portrait of a Serial Killer: The Shocking True Story of Ted Bundy |publisher=Robert Keller |date=2017|isbn=978-1548730673 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First two series of murders ==

=== Washington, Oregon ===
There is no consensus on when or where Bundy began killing women. He told different stories to different people and refused to divulge the specifics of his earliest crimes, even as he confessed in graphic detail to dozens of later murders in the days preceding his execution.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=400}} He told Nelson that he attempted his first kidnapping in 1969 in [[Ocean City, New Jersey]], but did not kill anyone until sometime in 1971 in Seattle.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=282–84}} He told psychologist Art Norman that he killed two women in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] in 1969 while visiting family in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="DailyNews" /&gt;{{sfn|Sullivan|2009|p=57}} He hinted but refused to elaborate to homicide detective [[Robert D. Keppel]] that he committed a murder in Seattle in 1972,{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=387}} and another murder in 1973 that involved a hitchhiker near [[Tumwater, Washington|Tumwater]].{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=396}} Rule and Keppel both believed that he might have started killing as a teenager.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=526}}{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=399–400}} Circumstantial evidence suggested that he abducted and killed 8-year-old Ann Marie Burr of Tacoma when he was 14 years old in 1961; this was an allegation that he repeatedly denied.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=387}} His earliest documented homicides were committed in 1974 when he was 27 years old. By his own admission, he had mastered the necessary skills—in the era before [[DNA profiling]]—to leave minimal incriminating forensic evidence at the crime scene.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=87}}

Shortly after midnight on January 4, 1974 (around the time that he terminated his relationship with Brooks), Bundy entered the [[basement apartment]] of 18-year-old Karen Sparks{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=389}} (identified as Joni Lenz,{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=57}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=27}} Mary Adams,{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1983|p=27}} or Terri Caldwell{{sfn|Sullivan|2009|p=14}} by various sources), a dancer and student at UW. After bludgeoning the sleeping woman senseless with a metal rod from her bed frame, he [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] her with either the same rod,{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=56-7}}{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=16}} or a metal [[speculum (medical)|speculum]],{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=27}} causing extensive internal injuries. She remained unconscious for 10 days,{{sfn|Sullivan|2009|p=14}} but survived with permanent physical and mental disabilities.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=28}} In the early morning hours of February 1, Bundy broke into the basement room of Lynda Ann Healy, a UW undergraduate who broadcast morning radio weather reports for skiers. He beat her unconscious, dressed her in blue jeans, a white blouse, and boots, and carried her away.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=60–62}}

During the first half of 1974, female college students  disappeared at the rate of about one per month. On March 12, Donna Gail Manson, a 19-year-old student at [[The Evergreen State College]] in [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], {{convert|60|mi|round=5|spell=in}} southwest of Seattle, left her dormitory to attend a jazz concert on campus, but never arrived. On April 17, Susan Elaine Rancourt disappeared while on her way to her dorm room after an evening advisers meeting at [[Central Washington University|Central Washington State College]] in [[Ellensburg, Washington|Ellensburg]], {{convert|110|mi|round=5}} east-southeast of Seattle.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=71}}&lt;ref name="Spokesman-Review" /&gt; Two female Central Washington students later came forward to report encounters—one on the night of Rancourt's disappearance, the other three nights earlier—with a man wearing an arm sling, asking for help carrying a load of books to his brown or tan [[Volkswagen Beetle]].{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=42–46}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=31–33}} On May 6, Roberta Kathleen Parks left her dormitory at [[Oregon State University]] in [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]], {{convert|85|mi|round=5}} south of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], to have coffee with friends at the [[Memorial Union (Oregon State University)|Memorial Union]], but never arrived.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=75–76}}

Detectives from the [[King County Sheriff's Office|King County]]&lt;!-- was "King Co. Police" then--&gt; and [[Seattle Police Department|Seattle]] police departments grew increasingly concerned. There was no significant physical evidence, and the missing women had little in common, apart from being young, attractive, white college students with long hair parted in the middle.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=73–74}} On June 1, Brenda Carol Ball, 22, disappeared after leaving the Flame Tavern in [[Burien, Washington|Burien]], near [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]]. She was last seen in the parking lot, talking to a brown-haired man with his arm in a sling.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=77}} In the early hours of June 11, UW student Georgann &lt;!-- spelling of first name is correct, please do not change --&gt; Hawkins vanished while walking down a brightly lit alley between her boyfriend's dormitory residence and her sorority house.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=37}} The next morning, three Seattle homicide detectives and a [[criminalist]] combed the entire alleyway on their hands and knees, finding nothing.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=82}} After Hawkins's disappearance was publicized, witnesses came forward to report seeing a man that night who was in an alley behind a nearby dormitory; he was on crutches with a leg cast and was struggling to carry a briefcase.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=38}} One woman recalled that the man asked her to help him carry the case to his car, a light brown Volkswagen Beetle.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=75}}

During this period, Bundy was working in Olympia at the Department of Emergency Services (DES), a state government agency involved in the search for the missing women. There, he met and dated Carole Ann Boone, a twice-divorced mother of two who, six years later, would play an important role in the final phase of his life.&lt;ref name="Michaud-trutv" /&gt;

[[File:Ted Bundy volkswagen.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A light tan rusty Volkswagen is positioned for display behind a chain made of handcuffs|Ted Bundy's 1968 Volkswagen Beetle, where he committed many of his crimes. Vehicle on display at the now-defunct [[National Museum of Crime &amp; Punishment]]&lt;ref name="Kennicott-wapo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CrimeMuseum-car" /&gt;]]
Reports of the six missing women and Sparks' brutal beating appeared prominently in newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=81}} Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=76}} Pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies,{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=77}} but the paucity of physical evidence severely hampered them. Police could not provide reporters with the little information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=vi}} Further similarities between the victims were noted: The disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work, within a week of midterm or final exams; all of the victims were wearing slacks or blue jeans; and at most crime scenes, there were sightings of a man wearing a cast or a sling, and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=90–91}}

The Pacific Northwest murders culminated on July 14, with the broad daylight abductions of two women from a crowded beach at [[Lake Sammamish State Park]] in [[Issaquah, Washington|Issaquah]], a suburb {{convert|20|mi|round=5|spell=in}} east of Seattle.&lt;ref name=bbapdent74&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6DlYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VPcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1580%2C3631677 |work=The Bulletin |location=(Bend, Oregon)|agency=Associated Press |title=Dental records establish identities of two women  |date=September 11, 1974 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five female witnesses described an attractive young man wearing a white tennis outfit with his left arm in a sling, speaking with a light accent, perhaps Canadian or British. Introducing himself as "Ted," he asked their help in unloading a sailboat from his tan or bronze-colored Volkswagen Beetle. Four refused; one accompanied him as far as his car, saw that there was no sailboat, and fled. Three additional witnesses saw him approach Janice Anne Ott, 23, a probation case worker at the King County Juvenile Court, with the sailboat story, and watched her leave the beach in his company.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=3–6}} About four hours later, Denise Marie Naslund, a 19-year-old woman who was studying to become a computer programmer, left a picnic to go to the restroom and never returned.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=99–101}} Bundy told Stephen Michaud that Ott was still alive when he returned with Naslund—and that he forced one to watch as he murdered the other{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=45}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=139–42}}—but he later denied it in an interview with Lewis on the eve of his execution.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=294–295}}

The King County police were finally provided with a detailed description of the suspect and his car when they posted fliers throughout the Seattle area. A composite sketch was printed in regional newspapers and broadcast on local television stations. Elizabeth Kloepfer, Ann Rule, a DES employee, and a UW psychology professor all recognized the profile, the sketch, and the car, and reported Bundy as a possible suspect;{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=61–62}} but detectives—who were receiving up to 200 tips per day{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=40}}—thought it unlikely that a clean-cut law student with no adult criminal record could be the perpetrator.{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=103–05}}

On September 6, two grouse hunters stumbled across the skeletal remains of Ott and Naslund near a service road in Issaquah, {{convert|2|mi|0|spell=in}} east of Lake Sammamish State Park.&lt;ref name=bbapdent74/&gt;{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=8–15}} An extra [[femur]] and several [[human vertebra|vertebrae]] found at the site were later identified by Bundy as Georgann Hawkins'.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=18}} Six months later, forestry students from [[Green River Community College]] discovered the skulls and [[human mandible|mandibles]] of Healy, Rancourt, Parks, and Ball on Taylor Mountain, where Bundy frequently hiked, just east of Issaquah.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=25–30}} Manson's remains were never recovered.

In August 1974, Bundy received a second acceptance from the [[University of Utah]] [[S.J. Quinney College of Law|Law School]] and moved to [[Salt Lake City]], leaving Kloepfer in Seattle. While he called Kloepfer often, he dated "at least a dozen" other women.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=130–31}} When he studied the first-year law curriculum a second time, "he was devastated to find out that the other students had something, some intellectual capacity, that he did not. He found the classes completely incomprehensible. 'It was a great disappointment to me,' he said."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=55}}

A new string of homicides began the following month, including two that would remain undiscovered until Bundy confessed to them shortly before his execution. On September 2, he raped and strangled a still-unidentified hitchhiker in [[Idaho]], then either disposed of the remains immediately in a nearby river,{{sfn|Sullivan|2009|p=86}} or returned the next day to photograph and dismember {{nowrap|the corpse.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=257–59}}{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=527}}}} On October 2, he seized 16-year-old Nancy Wilcox in [[Holladay, Utah|Holladay]], a suburb of Salt Lake City,{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=91}} and dragged her into a wooded area, intending to "de-escalate" his pathological urges, he claimed, by raping and then releasing her; but he strangled her—accidentally, he said—in the process of trying to silence her screams.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=143–46}}  Her remains were buried near [[Capitol Reef National Park]], some {{convert|200|mi|round=5|spell=in}} south of Holladay, but were never found.&lt;ref name="Psychics" /&gt;

On October 18, Melissa Anne Smith—the 17-year-old daughter of the police chief of [[Midvale, Utah|Midvale]] (another Salt Lake City suburb)—disappeared after leaving a pizza parlor. Her nude body was found in a nearby mountainous area nine days later. Postmortem examination indicated that she may have remained alive for up to seven days following her disappearance.{{sfn|Sullivan|2009|p=96}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=92–93}} On October 31, Laura Ann Aime, also 17, disappeared {{convert|25|mi}} south in [[Lehi, Utah|Lehi]] after leaving a café just after midnight.{{sfn|Rule|1989|p=112}} Her naked body was found by hikers {{convert|9|mi|spell=in}} to the northeast in [[American Fork Canyon]] on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]].&lt;ref name="Deseret1977" /&gt; Both women had been beaten, raped, [[sodomy|sodomized]], and strangled with nylon stockings.&lt;ref name="Bell-KillingSpree" /&gt;{{sfn|Rule|1989|pp=112–13}} Years later, Bundy described his postmortem rituals with the corpses of Smith and Aime, including hair shampooing and application of makeup.{{sfn|Rule|1989|p=486}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=334–35}}

In the late afternoon of November 8, Bundy approached 18-year-old telephone operator Carol DaRonch at [[Fashion Place|Fashion Place Mall]] in [[Murray, Utah|Murray]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JXm3zfQuNEUC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=fashion+place+mall+bundy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NgFzncrGwm&amp;sig=WjQ55lmIzE1jKLJgGxJAJW221Qw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J_oNVeTDBISFyQTG-YGYCA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=fashion%20place%20mall%20bundy&amp;f=false |title= Ted Bundy: The FBI File  |quote= Bundy was convicted of kidnaping Carol DaRonch, 19, from Fashion Place Mall earlier that day. |accessdate= March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; less than a mile from the Midvale restaurant where Melissa Smith was last seen. He identified himself as "Officer Roseland" of the Murray Police Department and told DaRonch that someone had attempted to break into her car. He asked her to accompany him to the station to file a complaint. When DaRonch pointed out to Bundy that he was driving on a road that did not lead to the police station, he immediately pulled to the shoulder and attempted to handcuff her. During their struggle, he inadvertently fastened both handcuffs to the same wrist, and DaRonch was able to open the car door and escape.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=93–95}} Later that evening, Debra Jean Kent, a 17-year-old student at [[Viewmont High School]] in [[Bountiful, Utah|Bountiful]], {{convert|20|mi|round=5|spell=in}} north of Murray, disappeared after leaving a theater production at the school to pick up her brother.&lt;ref name="map-Murray2Bountiful" /&gt; The school's drama teacher and a student told police that "a stranger" had asked each of them to come out to the parking lot to identify a car. Another student later saw the same man pacing in the rear of the auditorium, and the drama teacher spotted him again shortly before the end of the play.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=95–97}} Outside the auditorium, investigators found a key that unlocked the handcuffs removed from Carol DaRonch's wrist.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=101}}

In November, Elizabeth Kloepfer called King County police a second time after she read that young women were now disappearing in towns surrounding Salt Lake City. Detective Randy Hergesheimer of the Major Crimes division interviewed her in detail. By then, Bundy had risen considerably on the King County hierarchy of suspicion, but the Lake Sammamish witness considered most reliable by detectives failed to identify him from a photo lineup.{{sfn|Kendall|1981|pp=78–79}} In December, Kloepfer called the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office and repeated her suspicions. Bundy's name was added to their list of suspects, but at that time no credible evidence linked him to the Utah crimes.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=148–49}} In January 1975 Bundy returned to Seattle after his final exams and spent a week with Kloepfer, who did not tell him that she had reported him to police on three separate occasions. She made plans to visit him in Salt Lake City in August.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=149–50}}

In 1975, Bundy shifted much of his criminal activity eastward, from his base in Utah to [[Colorado]]. On January 12, a 23-year-old registered nurse named Caryn Eileen Campbell disappeared while walking down a well-lit hallway between the elevator and her room at the Wildwood Inn (now the Wildwood Lodge) in [[Snowmass Village, Colorado|Snowmass Village]], {{convert|400|mi|-1}} southeast of Salt Lake City.{{sfn|Rule|1989|p=126}} Her nude body was found a month later next to a dirt road just outside the resort. She had been killed by blows to her head from a blunt instrument that left distinctive linear grooved depressions on her skull; her body also bore deep cuts from a sharp weapon.{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=132–36}} {{convert|100|mi|spell=In}} northeast of Snowmass, on March 15, [[Vail, Colorado|Vail]] ski instructor Julie Cunningham, 26, disappeared while walking from her apartment to a dinner date with a friend. Bundy later told Colorado investigators that he approached Cunningham on crutches and asked her to help carry his ski boots to his car, where he clubbed and handcuffed her, then assaulted and strangled her at a secondary site near [[Rifle, Colorado|Rifle]], {{convert|90|mi|spell=in}} west of Vail.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=402–07}} Weeks later, he made the six-hour drive from Salt Lake City to revisit her remains.{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7431–98}}

Denise Lynn Oliverson, 25, disappeared near the Utah–Colorado border in [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]] on April 6 while riding her bicycle to her parents' house; her bike and sandals were found under a viaduct near a railroad bridge.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=110}} On May 6, Bundy lured 12-year-old Lynette Dawn Culver from Alameda Junior High School in [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]], Idaho, {{convert|160|mi|round=5}} north of Salt Lake City. He drowned and then sexually assaulted her in his hotel room,{{sfn|Sullivan|2009|pp=137–38}} before disposing of her body in a river north of Pocatello (possibly the [[Snake River|Snake]]).&lt;ref name="Culver"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moscow"/&gt;

In mid-May, three of Bundy's Washington State DES coworkers, including Carole Ann Boone, visited him in Salt Lake City and stayed for a week in his apartment. Bundy subsequently spent a week in Seattle with Kloepfer in early June and they discussed getting married the following Christmas. Again, Kloepfer made no mention of her multiple discussions with the King County Police and Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office, and Bundy disclosed neither his ongoing relationship with Boone nor a concurrent romance with a Utah law student known in various accounts as Kim Andrews{{sfn|Kendall|1981|pp=140–41}} or Sharon Auer.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=164–65}}

On June 28, Susan Curtis vanished from the campus of [[Brigham Young University]] in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], {{convert|45|mi|round=5}} south of Salt Lake City. Curtis's murder became Bundy's last confession, tape-recorded moments before he entered the execution chamber.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=343}} The bodies of Wilcox, Kent, Cunningham, Culver, Curtis, and Oliverson were never recovered.

In August or September 1975, Bundy was baptized into [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], although he was not an active participant in services and ignored most church restrictions.&lt;ref name="Smith1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett-Connaughton1978" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=158}}: "Bundy joined the Mormon Church that September."&lt;/ref&gt; He would later be excommunicated by the LDS Church following his 1976 kidnapping conviction.&lt;ref name="Smith1979" /&gt; When asked his religious preference after his arrest, Bundy answered "Methodist", the religion of his childhood.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|p=389}}

In Washington state, investigators were still struggling to analyze the Pacific Northwest murder spree that had ended as abruptly as it had begun. In an effort to make sense of an overwhelming mass of data, they resorted to the then-innovative strategy of compiling a database. They used the King County payroll computer, a "huge, primitive machine" by contemporary standards, but the only one available for their use. After inputting the many lists they had compiled—classmates and acquaintances of each victim, Volkswagen owners named "Ted", known sex offenders, and so on—they queried the computer for coincidences. Out of thousands of names, 26 turned up on four separate lists; one was Ted Bundy. Detectives also manually compiled a list of their 100 "best" suspects, and Bundy was on that list as well. He was "literally at the top of the pile" of suspects when word came from Utah of his arrest.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=62–66}}

== Arrest and first trial ==
[[File:Ted Bundy murder kit.JPG|right|thumb|upright|alt=The murder kit includes a sports bag, garbage bags, ski mask, nylon stocking with holes, flashlight, crowbar, an ice pick, and some gloves.|Items found in Bundy's Volkswagen, Utah, 1975]]

On August 16, 1975, Bundy was arrested by a Utah Highway Patrol officer in [[West Valley City, Utah|Granger]] (another Salt Lake City suburb). The officer had observed Bundy cruising a residential area in the pre-dawn hours; Bundy fled the area at high speed after seeing the patrol car.&lt;ref name="Gehrke2000" /&gt; The officer searched the car after he noticed that the Volkswagen's front passenger seat had been removed and placed on the rear seats. He found a ski mask, a second mask fashioned from pantyhose, a crowbar, handcuffs, trash bags, a coil of rope, an ice pick, and other items initially assumed to be burglary tools. Bundy explained that the ski mask was for skiing, he had found the handcuffs in a [[dumpster]], and the rest were common household items.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=98–99, 113–15}} However, Detective Jerry Thompson remembered a similar suspect and car description from the November 1974 DaRonch kidnapping, which matched Bundy's name from Kloepfer's December 1974 phone call. In a search of Bundy's apartment, police found a guide to Colorado ski resorts with a checkmark by the Wildwood Inn{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=71}} and a brochure that advertised the Viewmont High School play in Bountiful, where Debra Kent had disappeared.{{sfn|Sullivan|2009|p=151}} The police did not have sufficient evidence to detain Bundy, and he was released on his own [[recognizance]]. Bundy later said that searchers missed a collection of [[Instant camera|Polaroid]] photographs of his victims; he destroyed the photographs after he was released.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=258}}

Salt Lake City police placed Bundy on 24-hour surveillance, and Thompson flew to Seattle with two other detectives to interview Kloepfer. She told them that in the year prior to Bundy's move to Utah, she had discovered objects that she "couldn't understand" in her house and in Bundy's apartment. These items included crutches, a bag of plaster of Paris that he admitted stealing from a medical supply house, and a meat cleaver that was never used for cooking. Additional objects included surgical gloves, an Oriental knife in a wooden case that he kept in his glove compartment, and a sack full of women's clothing.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=167}} Bundy was perpetually in debt, and Kloepfer suspected that he had stolen almost everything of significant value that he possessed. When she confronted him over a new TV and stereo, he warned her, "If you tell anyone, I'll break your fucking neck."{{sfn|Kendall|1981|p=74}} She said Bundy became "very upset" whenever she considered cutting her hair, which was long and parted in the middle. She would sometimes awaken in the middle of the night to find him under the bed covers with a flashlight, examining her body. He kept a [[lug wrench]], taped halfway up the handle, in the trunk of her car—another Volkswagen Beetle, which he often borrowed—"for protection". The detectives confirmed that Bundy had not been with Kloepfer on any of the nights during which the Pacific Northwest victims had vanished, nor on the day Ott and Naslund were abducted.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=187–94}} Shortly thereafter, Kloepfer was interviewed by Seattle homicide detective Kathy McChesney, and learned of the existence of Stephanie Brooks and her brief engagement to Bundy around Christmas 1973.{{sfn|Kendall|1981|pp=96–100}}

[[File:Ted-bundy.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Bundy is facing right in the first photo and facing front in the second. He has medium long hair and is wearing a turtleneck sweater.|Bundy's 1975 Utah [[mug shots]]]]

In September, Bundy sold his Volkswagen Beetle to a Midvale teenager.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=226–27}} Utah police impounded it, and FBI technicians dismantled and searched it. They found hairs matching samples obtained from Caryn Campbell's body.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=188}} Later, they also identified hair strands "microscopically indistinguishable" from those of Melissa Smith and Carol DaRonch.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=250}} FBI lab specialist Robert Neill concluded that the presence of hair strands in one car matching three different victims who had never met one another would be "a coincidence of mind-boggling rarity".{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=189–91}}

On October 2, detectives put Bundy into a lineup. DaRonch immediately identified him as "Officer Roseland". In the same lineup, witnesses from Bountiful picked him as the stranger who lurked about the high school auditorium.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=178–79}} There was insufficient evidence to link him to Debra Kent (whose body was never found), but more than enough evidence to charge him with aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault in the DaRonch case. He was freed on $15,000 bail, paid by his parents,{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=24}} and spent most of the time between indictment and trial in Seattle, living in Kloepfer's house. Seattle police had insufficient evidence to charge him in the Pacific Northwest murders, but kept him under close surveillance. "When Ted and I stepped out on the porch to go somewhere," Kloepfer wrote, "so many unmarked police cars started up that it sounded like the beginning of the Indy 500."{{sfn|Kendall|1981|pp=119–20}}

In November, the three principal Bundy investigators—Jerry Thompson from Utah, Robert Keppel from Washington, and Michael Fisher from Colorado—met in [[Aspen, Colorado]] and exchanged information with 30 detectives and prosecutors from five states.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=213–15}} While officials left the meeting (later known as the Aspen Summit) convinced that Bundy was the murderer they sought, they agreed that more hard evidence would be needed before he could be charged with any of the murders.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=163–65}}

On February 23, 1976, Bundy stood trial for the DaRonch kidnapping. On the advice of his attorney, John O'Connell, Bundy waived his right to a jury due to the negative publicity surrounding the case. On March 1, after a four-day [[bench trial]] and a weekend of deliberation, Judge Stewart Hanson Jr. found him guilty of kidnapping and assault.{{sfn|Kendall|1981|pp=140–141}}{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=205}} On June 30, he was sentenced to serve a minimum of one to a maximum of 15 years in the Utah State Prison.{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=24}} In October, he was found hiding in bushes in the prison yard carrying an "escape kit"—road maps, airline schedules, and a social security card—and spent several weeks in solitary confinement.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=265–267}} Later that month, Colorado authorities charged him with Caryn Campbell's murder. After a period of resistance, he waived [[extradition]] proceedings and was transferred to Aspen in January 1977.{{sfn|Rule|1989|p=219}}{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=25}}

== Escapes ==
[[File:Pitkin County Courthouse.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A two-story brick building with a tall tower is partially obscured by trees.| Pitkin County Courthouse. Bundy jumped from the second window from the left, second story.{{sfn|Winn|Merrill|1980}}]]
On June 7, 1977, Bundy was transported {{convert|40|mi}} from the Garfield County jail in [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]] to [[Pitkin County Courthouse]] in Aspen for a preliminary hearing. He had elected to [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|serve as his own attorney]], and as such, was excused by the judge from wearing handcuffs or leg shackles.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=285}} During a recess, he asked to visit the courthouse's law library to research his case. Bundy was concealed behind a bookcase when he opened a window and jumped from the second story, spraining his right ankle as he landed. After shedding an outer layer of clothing he walked through Aspen as roadblocks were being set up on its outskirts, then hiked southward onto [[Aspen Mountain (Colorado)|Aspen Mountain]]. Near its summit he broke into a hunting cabin and stole food, clothing, and a rifle.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=197}} The following day he left the cabin and continued south toward the town of [[Crested Butte, Colorado|Crested Butte]], but became lost in the forest. For two days he wandered aimlessly on the mountain, missing two trails that led downward to his intended destination. On June 10, he broke into a camping trailer on Maroon Lake, {{convert|10|mi}} south of Aspen, taking food and a ski parka; but instead of continuing southward, he walked back north toward Aspen, eluding roadblocks and search parties along the way.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=286–291}} Three days later, he stole a car at the edge of Aspen Golf Course. Cold, sleep-deprived, and in constant pain from his sprained ankle, he drove back into Aspen, where two police officers noticed his car weaving in and out of its lane and pulled him over. He had been a fugitive for six days.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=203–05}} In the car were maps of the mountain area around Aspen that prosecutors were using to demonstrate the location of Caryn Campbell's body (as his own attorney, Bundy had rights of [[Discovery (law)|discovery]]), indicating that his escape was not a spontaneous act, but had been planned.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=290–293}}

Back in jail in Glenwood Springs, Bundy ignored the advice of friends and legal advisors to stay put. The case against him, already weak at best, was deteriorating steadily as pretrial motions consistently resolved in his favor and significant bits of evidence were ruled inadmissible.{{sfn|Winn|Merrill|1980|pp=204–208}} "A more rational defendant might have realized that he stood a good chance of acquittal, and that beating the murder charge in Colorado would probably have dissuaded other prosecutors ... with as little as a year and a half to serve on the DaRonch conviction, had Ted persevered, he could have been a free man."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=206}} Instead, Bundy assembled a new escape plan. He acquired a detailed floor plan of the jail and a hacksaw blade from other inmates, and accumulated $500 in cash, smuggled in over a six-month period, he later said, by visitors—Carole Ann Boone in particular.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=306}} During the evenings, while other prisoners were showering, he sawed a hole about one foot (0.30 m) square between the steel reinforcing bars in his cell's ceiling and, having lost {{convert|35|lb}}, was able to wriggle through it into the crawl space above.&lt;ref name="ChiOmegaKiller" /&gt; In the weeks that followed he made a series of practice runs, exploring the space. Multiple reports from an informant of movement within the ceiling during the night were not investigated.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=209}}

By late 1977, Bundy's impending trial had become a [[cause célèbre]] in the small town of Aspen, and Bundy filed a motion for a [[change of venue]] to [[Denver]].{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=302–03}}  On December 23 the Aspen trial judge granted the request—but to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], where juries had historically been hostile to murder suspects.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=304–05}} On the night of December 30, with most of the jail staff on Christmas break and nonviolent prisoners on [[furlough]] with their families,{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=305}} Bundy piled books and files in his bed, covered them with a blanket to simulate his sleeping body, and climbed into the crawlspace. He broke through the ceiling into the apartment of the chief jailer—who was out for the evening with his wife{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=308}}—changed into street clothes from the jailer's closet, and walked out the front door to freedom.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=209–11}}

After stealing a car, Bundy drove eastward out of Glenwood Springs, but the car soon broke down in the mountains on [[Interstate 70]]. A passing motorist gave him a ride into Vail, {{convert|60|mi}} to the east. From there he caught a bus to Denver, where he boarded a morning flight to [[Chicago]]. In Glenwood Springs, the jail's skeleton crew did not discover the escape until noon on December 31, more than 17 hours later. By then Bundy was already in Chicago.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=212–13}}

== Florida ==
[[File:TedBundyprisonFlorida.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Bundy casually leans on the wall while dressed in prison garb.|Bundy in Tallahassee during his triple murder indictment, July 1978]]

From Chicago, Bundy traveled by train to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. There, on January 2 in a local tavern, he watched his alma mater UW defeat [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] in the [[1978 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]].{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=215–16}} Five days later he stole a car and drove to [[Atlanta]], where he boarded a bus and arrived in [[Tallahassee, Florida]], on the morning of January 8. He rented a room under the alias Chris Hagen at a boarding house near the [[Florida State University]] (FSU) campus. Bundy later said that he initially resolved to find legitimate employment and refrain from further criminal activity, knowing he could probably remain free and undetected in Florida indefinitely as long as he did not attract the attention of police;{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=7}} but his lone job application, at a construction site, had to be abandoned when he was asked to produce identification.{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=31}} He reverted to his old habits of shoplifting and stealing credit cards from women's wallets left in shopping carts.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=318}}

In the early hours of January 15, 1978—one week after his arrival in Tallahassee—Bundy entered FSU's [[Chi Omega]] sorority house through a rear door with a faulty locking mechanism.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=332}} Beginning at about 2:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. he bludgeoned Margaret Bowman, 21, with a piece of oak firewood as she slept, then garroted her with a nylon stocking.{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=34}} He then entered the bedroom of 20-year-old Lisa Levy and beat her unconscious, strangled her, tore one of her nipples, bit deeply into her left buttock, and sexually assaulted her with a hair mist bottle.{{sfn|Rule|1989|pp=278–79}} In an adjoining bedroom he attacked Kathy Kleiner, breaking her jaw and deeply lacerating her shoulder; and Karen Chandler, who suffered a concussion, broken jaw, loss of teeth, and a crushed finger.&lt;ref name="EveningIndependent" /&gt; Tallahassee detectives later determined that the four attacks took place in a total of less than 15 minutes, within earshot of more than 30 witnesses who heard nothing.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=332}} After leaving the sorority house, Bundy broke into a basement apartment eight blocks away and attacked FSU student Cheryl Thomas, dislocating her shoulder and fracturing her jaw and skull in five places. She was left with permanent deafness, and equilibrium damage that ended her dance career.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=340}} On Thomas's bed, police found a semen stain and a pantyhose "mask" containing two hairs "similar to Bundy's in class and characteristic".{{sfn|Rule|1989|p=277}}{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=339}}

On February 8, Bundy drove {{convert|150|mi}} east to [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], in a stolen FSU van. In a parking lot he approached 14-year-old Leslie Parmenter, the daughter of Jacksonville Police Department's Chief of Detectives, identifying himself as "Richard Burton, Fire Department", but retreated when Parmenter's older brother arrived and challenged him.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=243–44}} That afternoon, he backtracked {{convert|60|mi}} westward to [[Lake City, Florida|Lake City]]. At Lake City Junior High School the following morning, 12-year-old Kimberly Diane Leach was summoned to her [[homeroom]] by a teacher to retrieve a forgotten purse; she never returned to class. Seven weeks later, after an intensive search, her partially mummified remains were found in a pig farrowing shed near [[Suwannee River State Park]], {{convert|35|mi}} northwest of Lake City.&lt;ref name="FL-HighwayPatrol" /&gt;{{sfn|Rule|1989|pp=324–25}}

On February 12, with insufficient cash to pay his overdue rent and a growing suspicion that police were closing in on him,{{sfn|Winn|Merrill|1980|pp=245–246}} Bundy stole a car and fled Tallahassee, driving westward across the [[Florida Panhandle]]. Three days later, at around 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., he was stopped by [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] police officer David Lee near the [[Alabama]] state line after a "wants and warrants" check showed his Volkswagen Beetle was stolen.&lt;ref name="pensacolapolice" /&gt; When told he was under arrest, Bundy kicked Lee's legs out from under him and took off running. Lee fired a warning shot followed by a second round, gave chase and tackled him. The two struggled over Lee's gun before the officer finally subdued and arrested Bundy.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=366}} In the stolen vehicle were three sets of IDs belonging to female FSU students, 21 stolen credit cards and a stolen television set.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=367}} Also found were a pair of dark-rimmed non-prescription glasses and a pair of plaid slacks, later identified as the disguise worn by "Richard Burton, Fire Department" in Jacksonville.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=398}} As Lee transported his suspect to jail, unaware that he had just arrested one of the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]], he heard Bundy say, "I wish you had killed me."{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=321–23}}

== Florida trials, marriage ==
[[File:TedBundyincustody.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A smiling Bundy holds a sheaf of papers and enters a vehicle. He is escorted by two police officers.|Departing a preliminary hearing, Miami, 1979]]

Following a change of venue to Miami, Bundy stood trial for the Chi Omega homicides and assaults in June 1979.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=274}} The trial was covered by 250 reporters from five continents and was the first to be televised nationally in the United States.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=10}} Despite the presence of five court-appointed attorneys, Bundy again handled much of his own defense. From the beginning, he "sabotaged the entire defense effort out of spite, distrust, and grandiose delusion", Nelson later wrote. "Ted [was] facing murder charges, with a possible death sentence, and all that mattered to him apparently was that he be in charge."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=87, 91}}

According to Mike Minerva, a Tallahassee public defender and member of the defense team, a pre-trial [[plea bargain]] was negotiated in which Bundy would plead guilty to killing Levy, Bowman and Leach in exchange for a firm 75-year prison sentence. Prosecutors were amenable to a deal, by one account, because "prospects of losing at trial were very good."{{sfn|Dekle|2011|p=124}} Bundy, on the other hand, saw the plea deal not only as a means of avoiding the death penalty, but also as a "tactical move": he could enter his plea, then wait a few years for evidence to disintegrate or become lost and for witnesses to die, move on, or retract their testimony. Once the case against him had deteriorated beyond repair, he could file a post-conviction motion to set aside the plea and secure an acquittal.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=271–72; attorney Millard Farmer devised this strategy as a means of "selling" Bundy on the plea deal, according to this account}}{{sfn|Dekle|2011|p=125}} At the last minute, however, Bundy refused the deal. "It made him realize he was going to have to stand up in front of the whole world and say he was guilty", Minerva said. "He just couldn't do it."&lt;ref name="Word1999-01-24" /&gt;

At trial, crucial testimony came from Chi Omega sorority members Connie Hastings, who placed Bundy in the vicinity of the Chi Omega House that evening,{{sfn|Dekle|2011|pp=154–155}} and Nita Neary, who saw him leaving the sorority house clutching the oak murder weapon.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=227, 283}}&lt;ref name="St.Petersburg1" /&gt; Incriminating physical evidence included impressions of the bite wounds Bundy had inflicted on Lisa Levy's left buttock, which forensic [[odontologist]]s Richard Souviron and Lowell Levine matched to castings of Bundy's teeth.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=230, 283–85}}{{sfn|Dekle|2011|p=156}} The jury deliberated for less than seven hours before convicting him on July 24, 1979, of the Bowman and Levy murders, three counts of attempted first degree murder (for the assaults on Kleiner, Chandler and Thomas) and two counts of burglary.

Six months later, a second trial took place in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], for the abduction and murder of Kimberly Leach.&lt;ref name="Bell-KimberlyLeach" /&gt; Bundy was found guilty once again, after less than eight hours' deliberation, due principally to the testimony of an eyewitness who saw him leading Leach from the schoolyard to his stolen van.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=303}} Important material evidence included clothing fibers with an unusual manufacturing error, found in the van and on Leach's body, which matched fibers from the jacket Bundy was wearing when he was arrested.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=306–07}}

During the penalty phase of the trial, Bundy took advantage of an obscure Florida law providing that a marriage declaration in court, in the presence of a judge, constituted a legal marriage. As he was questioning former Washington State DES coworker Carole Ann Boone—who had moved to Florida to be near Bundy, had testified on his behalf during both trials, and was again testifying on his behalf as a character witness—he asked her to marry him. She accepted, and Bundy declared to the court that they were legally married.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=308–10}}&lt;ref name="AP1981-09-30wife-pregnant" /&gt;

Shortly after the conclusion of the Leach trial and the beginning of the long appeals process that followed, Bundy initiated a series of interviews with Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth. Speaking mostly in third person to avoid "the stigma of confession", he began for the first time to divulge details of his crimes and thought processes.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=15–17}}

He recounted his career as a thief, confirming Kloepfer's long-time suspicion that he had shoplifted virtually everything of substance that he owned.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=37–39}} "The big payoff for me," he said, "was actually ''possessing'' whatever it was I had stolen. I really enjoyed having something ... that I had wanted and gone out and taken." Possession proved to be an important motive for rape and murder as well.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=41}} Sexual assault, he said, fulfilled his need to "totally possess" his victims.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=102–14}} At first, he killed his victims "as a matter of expediency ... to eliminate the possibility of [being] caught"; but later, murder became part of the "adventure". "The ''ultimate'' possession was, in fact, the taking of the life", he said. "And then ... the physical possession of the remains."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=124–26}}

Bundy also confided in Special Agent William Hagmaier of the FBI [[Behavioral Analysis Unit]]. Hagmaier was struck by the "deep, almost mystical satisfaction" that Bundy took in murder. "He said that after a while, murder is not just a crime of lust or violence", Hagmaier related. "It becomes possession. They are part of you ... [the victim] becomes a part of you, and you [two] are forever one ... and the grounds where you kill them or leave them become sacred to you, and you will always be drawn back to them." Bundy told Hagmaier that he considered himself to be an "amateur", an "impulsive" killer in his early years, before moving into what he termed his "prime" or "predator" phase at about the time of Lynda Healy's murder in 1974. This implied that he began killing well before 1974—though he never explicitly admitted doing so.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=380–96}}

In July 1984, Raiford guards found two hacksaw blades that Bundy had hidden in his cell. A steel bar in one of the cell's windows had been sawed completely through at the top and bottom and glued back into place with a homemade soap-based adhesive.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=528}}&lt;ref name="DN-trials" /&gt; Several months later, guards found an unauthorized mirror hidden in the cell, and Bundy was again moved to a different cell .{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=532}}
[[File:Ted Bundy mug shot.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An unsmiling Bundy faces the camera. |Mug shot taken the day after sentencing for the murder of Kimberly Leach]]
Sometime during this period, Bundy was attacked by a group of his fellow death row inmates. Though he denied having been assaulted, a number of inmates confessed to the crime, characterized by one source as a "gang rape".{{sfn|Dekle|2011|p=216}} Shortly thereafter, he was charged with a disciplinary infraction for unauthorized correspondence with another high-profile criminal, [[John Hinckley, Jr.|John Hinckley, Jr]].{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=155–156}} In October 1984, Bundy contacted [[Robert D. Keppel|Robert Keppel]] and offered to share his self-proclaimed expertise in serial killer psychology{{sfn|Rule|2009|p = 532}} in the ongoing hunt for his successor in Washington, the [[Gary Ridgway|Green River Killer]].{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p = 176}} Keppel and Green River Task Force detective [[Dave Reichert]] interviewed Bundy, but [[Gary Leon Ridgway]] remained at large for a further 17 years.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp = 33, 101, 135}} Keppel published a detailed documentation of the Green River interviews,{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p = }} and later collaborated with Michaud on another examination of the interview material.{{sfn|Keppel|Michaud|2011|loc = Kindle location 1690}} Bundy coined the nickname "The Riverman" for [[Gary Ridgway]], which was later used for the title of Keppel's book, ''The Riverman: Ted Bundy and I Hunt for the Green River Killer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Peyton|last=Whitely|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1995/aug/07/ted-bundy-helped-green-river-investigation/|title=Ted Bundy Helped Green River Investigation Detective Says Bundy Met With King County Officials Probing Killings|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|location=Spokane, Washington|date=August 7, 1995|access-date=May 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1986, an execution date (March 4) was set on the Chi Omega convictions; the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] issued a brief stay, but the execution was quickly rescheduled.{{sfn|Mello|1997|pp=103–104}} In April, shortly after the new date (July 2) was announced, Bundy finally confessed to Hagmaier and Nelson what they believed was the full range of his depredations, including details of what he did to some of his victims after their deaths. He told them that he revisited Taylor Mountain, Issaquah, and other secondary crime scenes, often several times, to lie with his victims and perform sexual acts with their decomposing bodies until [[putrefaction]] forced him to stop. In some cases, he drove for several hours each way and remained the entire night.{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7431–98}} In Utah, he applied makeup to Melissa Smith's lifeless face, and he repeatedly washed Laura Aime's hair. "If you've got time," he told Hagmaier, "they can be anything you want them to be."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=334–35}} He decapitated approximately twelve of his victims with a hacksaw,&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=339}} and kept at least one group of severed heads—probably the four later found on Taylor Mountain (Rancourt, Parks, Ball and Healy)—in his apartment for a period of time before disposing of them.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=378, 393}}

Less than 15 hours before the scheduled July 2 execution, the [[Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] stayed it indefinitely and remanded the Chi Omega case for review on multiple technicalities—including Bundy's mental competency to stand trial, and an erroneous instruction by the trial judge during the penalty phase requiring the jury to break a 6–6 tie between life imprisonment and the death penalty{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=111}}—that, ultimately, was never resolved.&lt;ref name="findlaw"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Bundy v. Wainwright|vol=794 F.2d|court=US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit|date=July 2, 1986|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/808/1410/173788/|access-date=October 11, 2018|quote=The judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the case REMANDED to that court for proper consideration.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new date (November 18, 1986) was then set to carry out the Leach sentence; the Eleventh Circuit Court issued a stay on November 17.&lt;ref name="findlaw"/&gt; In mid-1988, the Eleventh Circuit ruled against Bundy, and in December the Supreme Court denied a motion to review the ruling. Within hours of that final denial, a firm execution date of January 24, 1989, was announced.{{sfn|Mello|1997|pp=103–106}} Bundy's journey through the appeals courts had been unusually rapid for a capital murder case: "Contrary to popular belief, the courts moved Bundy as fast as they could ... Even the prosecutors acknowledged that Bundy's lawyers never employed delaying tactics. Though people everywhere seethed at the apparent delay in executing the archdemon, Ted Bundy was actually on the fast track."{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|p=297}}

With all appeal avenues exhausted and no further motivation to deny his crimes, Bundy agreed to speak frankly with investigators. He confessed to Keppel that he had committed all eight of the Washington and Oregon homicides for which he was the prime suspect. He described three additional previously unknown victims in Washington and two in Oregon whom he declined to identify (if indeed he ever knew their identities).{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=337}} He said he left a fifth corpse—Donna Manson's—on Taylor Mountain,{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=516}} but incinerated her head in Kloepfer's fireplace. ("Of all the things I did to [Kloepfer]," he told Keppel, "this is probably the one she is least likely to forgive me for. Poor Liz."){{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=395}}

He described in graphic detail his abduction of Georgann Hawkins from the brightly lit UW alley; how he had lured her to his car before rendering her unconscious with a crowbar he had earlier placed beside the vehicle before handcuffing her and driving her to Issaquah, where he had strangled her,{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=367–78}} before spending the entire night with her body, and later revisited her corpse on three later occasions.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=336}}  He also admitted, for the first time, that he returned to the UW alley the morning after Hawkins's abduction and murder. There, in the very midst of a major crime scene investigation, he located and gathered Hawkins's earrings and one of her shoes, where he had left them in the adjoining parking lot, and departed, unobserved. "It was a feat so brazen," wrote Keppel, "that it astonishes police even today."{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=22}}

"He described the Issaquah crime scene [where the bones of Ott, Naslund, and Hawkins were found], and it was almost like he was just there", Keppel said. "Like he was seeing everything. He was infatuated with the idea because he spent so much time there. He is just totally consumed with murder all the time."{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=519}} Nelson's impressions were similar: "It was the absolute [[misogyny]] of his crimes that stunned me," she wrote, "his manifest rage against women. He had no compassion at all ... he was totally engrossed in the details. His murders were his life's accomplishments."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=258}}

Bundy confessed to detectives from Idaho, Utah, and Colorado that he had committed numerous additional homicides, including several that were unknown to the police. He explained that when he was in Utah he could bring his victims back to his apartment, "where he could reenact scenarios depicted on the covers of detective magazines."&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; A new ulterior strategy quickly became apparent: he withheld many details, hoping to parlay the incomplete information into yet another stay of execution. "There are other buried remains in Colorado", he admitted, but refused to elaborate.{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7600–05}} The new strategy—immediately dubbed "Ted's bones-for-time scheme"—served only to deepen the resolve of authorities to see Bundy executed on schedule, and yielded little new detailed information.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|pp=352–358}} In cases where he did give details, nothing was found.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=363}} Colorado detective Matt Lindvall interpreted this as a conflict between his desire to postpone his execution by divulging information and his need to remain in "total possession—the only person who knew his victims' true resting places."{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7550–58}}

When it became clear that no further stays would be forthcoming from the courts, Bundy supporters began lobbying for the only remaining option, executive clemency. Diana Weiner, a young Florida attorney and Bundy's last purported love interest,{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=136–137, 255, 302–304}} asked the families of several Colorado and Utah victims to petition Florida Governor [[Bob Martinez]] for a postponement to give Bundy time to reveal more information.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=264}} All refused.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=518}} "The families already believed that the victims were dead and that Ted had killed them", wrote Nelson. "They didn't need his confession."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=256}} Martinez made it clear that he would not agree to further delays in any case. "We are not going to have the system manipulated", he told reporters. "For him to be negotiating for his life over the bodies of victims is despicable."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=335–36}}

Boone had championed Bundy's innocence throughout all of his trials and felt "deeply betrayed" by his admission that he was, in fact, guilty. She moved back to Washington with her daughter and refused to accept his phone call on the day that he was executed. "She was hurt by his relationship with Diana [Weiner]," Nelson wrote, "and devastated by his sudden wholesale confessions in his last days."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=271, 303}}

Hagmaier was present during Bundy's final interviews with investigators. On the eve of his execution, he talked of suicide. "He did not want to give the state the satisfaction of watching him die", Hagmaier said.&lt;ref name="Word1999-01-24" /&gt;

== Death ==
Bundy died in the Raiford electric chair at 7:16&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]] on January 24, 1989; he was 42 years old. Hundreds of revelers—including 20 off-duty police officers, by one account&lt;ref name="Bundy'sWill"/&gt;—sang, danced and set off fireworks in a pasture across the street from the prison as the execution was carried out,&lt;ref name="Sentinel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2,000 Cheer"/&gt; then cheered loudly as the white hearse containing his corpse departed the prison.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=311–321}} His body was cremated in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]],{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=323}} and his ashes scattered at an undisclosed location in the [[Cascade Range]] of Washington State, in accordance with his [[will (law)|will]].&lt;ref name="Bundy'sWill"/&gt;{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=xxxvi–xxxvii}}

== Modus operandi and victim profiles ==

Bundy was an unusually organized and calculating criminal who used his extensive knowledge of law enforcement methodologies to elude identification and capture for years.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|pp=283–285}} His crime scenes were distributed over large geographic areas; his victim count had risen to at least 20 before it became clear that numerous investigators in widely disparate jurisdictions were hunting the same man.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|p=285}} His assault methods of choice were blunt trauma and strangulation, two relatively silent techniques that could be accomplished with common household items.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=30}} He deliberately avoided firearms due to the noise they made and the [[ballistics|ballistic]] evidence they left behind.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=111}} He was a "meticulous researcher" who explored his surroundings in minute detail, looking for safe sites to seize and dispose of victims.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=257}} He was unusually skilled at minimizing physical evidence.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=87}} His fingerprints were never found at a crime scene, nor any other incontrovertible evidence of his guilt, a fact he repeated often during the years in which he attempted to maintain his innocence.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=16}}
[[File:Ted Bundy in court.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Bundy is seen from the side. He is wearing a striped business suit and has his hand positioned near his chin.|Bundy in a Miami courtroom in 1979, ten years before his execution]]
Other significant obstacles for law enforcement were Bundy's generic, essentially anonymous physical features,{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=80}} and a curious [[chameleon]]-like ability to change his appearance almost at will.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=159}} Early on, police complained of the futility of showing his photograph to witnesses; he looked different in virtually every photo ever taken of him.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=vii}} In person, "his expression would so change his whole appearance that there were moments that you weren't even sure you were looking at the same person", said Stewart Hanson, Jr., the judge in the DaRonch trial. "He [was] really a changeling."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=176}} Bundy was well aware of this unusual quality and he exploited it, using subtle modifications of facial hair or hairstyle to significantly alter his appearance as necessary.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=73}} He concealed his one distinctive identifying mark, a dark mole on his neck, with turtleneck shirts and sweaters.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=241}} Even his Volkswagen Beetle proved difficult to pin down; its color was variously described by witnesses as metallic or non-metallic, tan or bronze, light brown or dark brown.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=172}}

Bundy's ''[[modus operandi]]'' evolved in organization and sophistication over time, as is typical of serial murderers, according to FBI experts.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; Early on, it consisted of forcible late-night entry followed by a violent attack with a blunt weapon on a sleeping victim. Some victims were sexually assaulted with inert objects; all except Healy were left as they lay, unconscious or dead.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=14–16}} As his methodology evolved Bundy became progressively more organized in his choice of victims and crime scenes. He would employ various ruses designed to lure his victim to the vicinity of his vehicle where he had pre-positioned a weapon, usually a crowbar. In many cases he wore a plaster cast on one leg or a sling on one arm, and sometimes hobbled on crutches, then requested assistance in carrying something to his vehicle. Bundy was regarded as handsome and charismatic by many of his victims, traits he exploited to win their confidence.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=3–6}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=12}}&lt;ref name="Time25crimes" /&gt; "Ted lured females", Michaud wrote, "the way a lifeless silk flower can dupe a honey bee."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=14}} Once near or inside his vehicle the victim would be overpowered, bludgeoned, and restrained with handcuffs. Most were sexually assaulted and strangled, either at the primary crime scene or (more commonly) after transport to a pre-selected secondary site, often a considerable distance away.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=12–13}}  In situations where his looks and charm were not useful, he invoked authority by identifying himself as a police officer or firefighter. Toward the end of his spree, in Florida, perhaps under the stress of being a fugitive, he regressed to indiscriminate attacks on sleeping victims.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

At secondary sites he would remove and later burn the victim's clothing,{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=196}} or in at least one case (Cunningham's) deposit them in a [[Goodwill Industries]] collection bin.{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7481}} Bundy explained that the clothing removal was ritualistic, but also a practical matter, as it minimized the chance of leaving trace evidence at the crime scene that could implicate him.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=196}} (A manufacturing error in fibers from his own clothing, ironically, provided a crucial incriminating link to Kimberly Leach.){{sfn|Rule|2009|p=279}} He often revisited his secondary crime scenes to engage in acts of necrophilia,{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=334}} and to groom or dress up the cadavers.{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7583–91, 7655}} Some victims were found wearing articles of clothing they had never worn, or nail polish that family members had never seen.&lt;ref name="Mystique" /&gt; He took Polaroid photos of many of his victims. "When you work hard to do something right," he told Hagmaier, "you don't want to forget it."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=334–35}} Consumption of large quantities of alcohol was an "essential component", he told Keppel, and later Michaud; he needed to be "extremely drunk" while on the prowl{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=379}}{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7046}} in order to "significantly diminish" his inhibitions and to "sedate" the "dominant personality" that he feared might prevent his inner "entity" from acting on his impulses.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=76–77}}

All of Bundy's known victims were white females, most of middle-class backgrounds. Almost all were between the ages of 15 and 25 and most were college students. He apparently never approached anyone he might have met before.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|pp=283–285}} (In their last conversation before his execution, Bundy told Kloepfer he had purposely stayed away from her "when he felt the power of his sickness building in him."){{sfn|Kendall|1981|p=182}} Rule noted that most of the identified victims had long straight hair, parted in the middle—like Stephanie Brooks, the woman who rejected him, and to whom he later became engaged and then rejected in return. Rule speculated that Bundy's animosity toward his first girlfriend triggered his protracted rampage and caused him to target victims who resembled her.{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=431–32}} Bundy dismissed this hypothesis: "[T]hey ... just fit the general criteria of being young and attractive", he told Hugh Aynesworth. "Too many people have bought this crap that all the girls were similar ... [but] almost everything was dissimilar ... physically, they were almost all different."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=156}} He did concede that youth and beauty were "absolutely indispensable criteria" in his choice of victims.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=85}}

After Bundy's execution, Ann Rule was surprised and troubled to hear from numerous "sensitive, intelligent, kind young women", who wrote or called to say they were deeply depressed because Bundy was dead. Many had corresponded with him, "each believing that she was his only one". Several said they suffered [[nervous breakdown]]s when he died. "Even in death, Ted damaged women," Rule wrote. "To get well, they must realize that they were conned by the master conman. They are grieving for a shadow man that never existed."{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=612-3}}

== Pathology ==
Bundy underwent multiple psychiatric examinations; the experts' conclusions varied. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, Professor of Psychiatry at the [[New York University School of Medicine]] and an authority on violent behavior, initially made a diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder]],{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=152}} but later changed her impression more than once.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=xiv}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=331}} She also suggested the possibility of a [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]], based on behaviors described in interviews and court testimony: a great-aunt witnessed an episode during which Bundy "seemed to turn into another, unrecognizable person&amp;nbsp;... [she] suddenly, inexplicably found herself afraid of her favorite nephew as they waited together at a dusk-darkened train station. He had turned into a stranger."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=154}} Lewis recounted a prison official in Tallahassee describing a similar transformation: "He said, 'He became weird on me.' He did a metamorphosis, a body and facial change, and he felt there was almost an odor emitting from him. He said, 'Almost a complete change of personality&amp;nbsp;... that was the day I was afraid of him.{{' "}}{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=231–232}}

While experts found Bundy's precise diagnosis elusive, the majority of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other [[Psychosis|psychoses]],&lt;ref name="Mack1999" /&gt; and toward [[antisocial personality disorder]] (ASPD).{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=13}}  Bundy displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients (who are often identified as "sociopaths" or "[[psychopathy|psychopaths]]"&lt;ref name="ASPD diagnosis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dobbert|first=Duane|title=Understanding Personality Disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eBAE1Z1xaeoC&amp;pg=PA55|accessdate=July 1, 2013 |year=2007|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=978-0-275-98960-6|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;), such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade;&lt;ref name="Long" /&gt; the ability to distinguish right from wrong, but with minimal effect on behavior;&lt;ref name="LilienfeldArkowitz2007-11-28" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[Ted knew the difference] between right and wrong, but it didn't matter, because ''he'' was special, and ''he'' deserved to have and do what he wanted. ''He'' was the center of the world; we were all paper-doll figures who didn't matter."{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=611–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an absence of guilt or remorse.&lt;ref name="Long" /&gt; "Guilt doesn't solve anything, really", Bundy said, in 1981. "It hurts you ... I guess I am in the enviable position of not having to deal with guilt."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=281}} There was also evidence of [[narcissism]], poor judgment, and manipulative behavior. "Sociopaths", prosecutor [[George R. Dekle, Sr.|George Dekle]] wrote, "are egotistical manipulators who think they can con anybody."{{sfn|Dekle|2011|p=131}} "Sometimes he manipulates even me", admitted one psychiatrist.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|p=288}} In the end, Lewis agreed with the majority: "I always tell my graduate students that if they can find me a real, true psychopath, I'll buy them dinner", she told Nelson. "I never thought they existed ... but I think Ted may have been one, a true psychopath, without any remorse or empathy at all."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=316}} [[Narcissistic personality disorder]] (NPD) has been proposed as an alternative diagnosis in at least one subsequent retrospective analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Douglas B.|last1=Samuel|first2=Thomas A.|last2=Widiger|title=Describing Ted Bundy’s Personality and Working towards DSM-V|journal=Independent Practitioner|publisher=Department of Psychology at the University of Kentucky|location=Lexington, Kentucky|date=2007|volume=27|issue=1|pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the afternoon before he was executed, Bundy granted an interview to [[James Dobson]], a psychologist and founder of the [[Evangelicalism|Christian evangelical]] organization [[Focus on the Family]].&lt;ref name="BundyDobsonInterview" /&gt; He used the opportunity to make new claims about violence in the media and the [[pornography|pornographic]] "roots" of his crimes. "It happened in stages, gradually", he said. "My experience with ... pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality, is once you become addicted to it ... I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material.

While Nelson was apparently convinced that Bundy's concern was genuine,{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=319}} most biographers,{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=320}}{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=611}}{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=401–02}} researchers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=P.|last=Hyatt|title=Ted Bundy's Final Interview|url=http://statement-analysis.blogspot.com/2012/10/statement-analysis-ted-bundys-final.html|website=Statement Analysis|publisher=[[Blogspot.com]]|date=October 3, 2012|accessdate=June 18, 2013|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907141045/http://statement-analysis.blogspot.com/2012/10/statement-analysis-ted-bundys-final.html |archive-date=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other observers&lt;ref name="Goldstein" /&gt; have concluded that his sudden condemnation of pornography was one last manipulative attempt to shift blame by catering to Dobson's agenda as a longtime pornography critic.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=318}} He told Dobson that "true crime" detective magazines had "corrupted" him and "fueled [his] fantasies ... to the point of becoming a serial killer"; yet in a 1977 letter to Ann Rule, he wrote, "Who in the world reads these publications? ... I have never purchased such a magazine, and [on only] two or three occasions have I ever picked one up."{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=611–12}} He told Michaud and Aynsworth in 1980, and Hagmaier the night before he spoke to Dobson, that pornography played a negligible role in his development as a serial killer.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=340}} "The problem wasn't pornography", wrote Dekle. "The problem was Bundy."{{sfn|Dekle|2011|p=219}}  "I wish I could believe that his motives were altruistic," wrote Rule. "But all I can see in that Dobson tape is another Ted Bundy manipulation of our minds. The effect of the tape is to place, once again, the onus of his crimes, not on ''himself'', but on ''us''."{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=611}}

Rule and Aynesworth both noted that for Bundy, the fault always lay with someone or something else. While he eventually confessed to 30 murders, he never accepted responsibility for any of them, even when offered that opportunity prior to the Chi Omega trial—which would have spared him the death penalty.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=603–04}} He deflected blame onto a wide variety of scapegoats, including his abusive grandfather, the absence of his biological father, the concealment of his true parentage, alcohol, the media, the police (whom he accused of planting evidence), "society" in general, violence on television and, ultimately, true crime periodicals and pornography.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=216–22, 250}} He blamed television programming—which he watched mostly on sets that he had stolen—for "brainwashing" him into stealing credit cards.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=404}} On at least one occasion he even tried to [[Victim blaming|blame his victims]]: "I have known people who ... radiate vulnerability", he wrote in a 1977 letter to Kloepfer. "Their facial expressions say 'I am afraid of you.' These people invite abuse ... By expecting to be hurt, do they subtly encourage it?"{{sfn|Kendall|1981|p=167}}

A significant element of delusion permeated his thinking: &lt;blockquote&gt;Bundy was always surprised when anyone noticed that one of his victims was missing, because he imagined America to be a place where everyone is invisible except to themselves. And he was always astounded when people testified that they had seen him in incriminating places, because Bundy did not believe people noticed each other.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|pp=288–289}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; "I don't know why everyone is out to get me", he complained to Lewis. "He really and truly did not have any sense of the enormity of what he had done," she said.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=340}} "A long-term serial killer erects powerful barriers to his guilt," Keppel wrote, "walls of denial that can sometimes never be breached."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=xi}}  Nelson agreed. "Each time he was forced to make an actual confession," she wrote, "he had to leap a steep barrier he had built inside himself long ago."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=280}}

The night before his execution, Bundy confessed to 30 homicides, but the true total remains unknown.

Fred Lawrence, the Methodist clergyman who administered Bundy's [[last rites]]. "That was my impression, my strong impression."{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|p=363}}

On the evening before his execution, Bundy reviewed his victim tally with Bill Hagmaier on a state-by-state basis for a total of 30 homicides:{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=339}}

=== Other possible victims ===
Bundy remains a suspect in several unsolved homicides, and is likely responsible for others that may never be identified; in 1987 he confided to Keppel that there were "some murders" that he would "never talk about", because they were committed "too close to home", "too close to family", or involved "victims who were very young".{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7375}}
* Ann Marie Burr, age 8, vanished from her Tacoma home on August 31, 1961,&lt;ref name="NamUS4593" /&gt; when Bundy was 14. The Burr house was on Bundy's newspaper delivery route. The victim's father was certain that he saw Bundy in a ditch at a construction site on the nearby UPS campus the morning his daughter disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, R.

''Ted and Ann: The Mystery of a Missing Child and Her Neighbor Ted Bundy''. New York, CreateSpace (2013), pp. 238–40. {{ISBN|1484925084}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bundy repeatedly denied culpability and wrote a letter of denial to the Burr family in 1986;{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=623}} but Keppel has observed that Burr fits all three of Bundy's "no discussion" categories of "too close to home", "too close to family", and "very young".{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7375}} Forensic testing of material evidence from the Burr crime scene, in 2011, yielded insufficient intact DNA sequences for comparison with Bundy's.&lt;ref name="BurrDNA" /&gt;
* Flight attendants Lisa E. Wick and Lonnie Trumbull, both 20, were bludgeoned with a piece of lumber as they slept in their basement apartment in Seattle's Queen Anne Hill district on June 23, 1966&lt;ref name="SpokaneDaily" /&gt; near the [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] store where Bundy worked at the time, and where the women regularly shopped. Trumbull died. In retrospect, Keppel noted many similarities to the Chi Omega crime scene.{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7135}} Wick, who suffered permanent memory loss as a result of the attack, later contacted Ann Rule: "I know that it was Ted Bundy who did that to us," she wrote, "but I can't tell you how I know."{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=509}} In the absence of incriminating evidence, Bundy's involvement remains speculative.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=386}}
* Vacationing college friends Susan Davis and Elizabeth Perry, both 19, were stabbed to death on May 30, 1969.&lt;ref name="DailyNews" /&gt; Their car was found that day abandoned beside the [[Garden State Parkway]] outside [[Somers Point, New Jersey]], near Atlantic City, {{convert|60|mi}} south of Philadelphia; and their bodies—one nude, one fully clothed—were found in nearby woods three days later.&lt;ref name="Free Lance" /&gt; Bundy attended Temple University from January through May 1969 and apparently did not move west until after Memorial Day weekend. While Bundy's accounts of his earliest crimes varied considerably between interviews, he told forensic psychologist Art Norman that his first murder victims were two women in the Philadelphia area.&lt;ref name="DailyNews" /&gt; Biographer Richard Larsen believed that Bundy committed the murders using his feigned-injury ruse, based on an investigator's interview with Julia, Bundy's aunt: Ted, she said, was wearing a leg cast due to an automobile accident on the weekend of the homicides, and therefore could not have traveled from Philadelphia to the [[New Jersey Shore|Jersey Shore]]; there is no official record of any such accident.&lt;ref name="'69 Killings3" /&gt; Bundy is considered a "strong suspect", but the case remains open.&lt;ref name="'69 Killings3" /&gt;

* Joyce LePage, 21, was last seen on July 22, 1971, on the campus of [[Washington State University]], where she was an undergraduate. Nine months later, her skeletal remains were found wrapped in carpeting and military blankets, bound with rope, in a deep ravine south of [[Pullman, Washington]].

In [[general relativity]], the '''topogravitic tensor''' is one of the three pieces of the [[Bel decomposition]] of the [[Riemann tensor]].

The topogravitic tensor can be interpreted as representing the [[sectional curvature]]s for the spatial part of a [[frame fields in general relativity|frame field]].

==History and core constructs==
[[James O. Prochaska]] of the [[University of Rhode Island]], and Carlo Di Clemente and colleagues developed the transtheoretical model beginning in 1977.&lt;ref name="Prochaska2005"/&gt; It is based on analysis and use of different theories of psychotherapy, hence the name "transtheoretical".

Prochaska and colleagues refined the model on the basis of research that they published in peer-reviewed journals and books.&lt;ref name="Prochaska1979"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Prochaska |first1=James O. |authorlink1=James O. Prochaska |last2=Norcross |first2=John C. |authorlink2=John C. Norcross |date=2014 |origyear=1979 |title=Systems of psychotherapy: a transtheoretical analysis |edition=8th |location=Australia; Stamford, CT |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |isbn=9781133314516 |oclc=851089001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages of change===
This construct refers to the temporal dimension of behavioural change. In the transtheoretical model, change is a "process involving progress through a series of stages":&lt;ref name=ProchaskaAJHP97/&gt;&lt;!--Preceding quotation and quotations in following bullets are taken directly from 1997 source, please do not alter--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prochaska |first1=JO |last2=Velicer |first2=WF |title=The transtheoretical model of health behavior change. |journal=American journal of health promotion : AJHP |date=1997 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=38-48 |doi=10.4278/0890-1171-12.1.38 |pmid=10170434}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Precontemplation ("not ready") – "People are not intending to take action in the foreseeable future, and can be unaware that their behaviour is problematic"
* Contemplation ("getting ready") – "People are beginning to recognize that their behaviour is problematic, and start to look at the pros and cons of their continued actions"
* Preparation ("ready") – "People are intending to take action in the immediate future, and may begin taking small steps toward behaviour change"&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In the 1983 version of the model, the Preparation stage is absent.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Action – "People have made specific overt modifications in modifying their problem behaviour or in acquiring new healthy behaviours"
* Maintenance – "People have been able to sustain action for at least six months and are working to prevent relapse"
* Termination – "Individuals have zero temptation and they are sure they will not return to their old unhealthy habit as a way of coping"&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In the 1983 version of the model, the Termination stage is absent. In the 1992 version of the model, Prochaska et al. showed Termination as the end of their "Spiral Model of the Stages of Change", not as a separate stage.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the researchers conceptualized "Relapse" (recycling) which is not a stage in itself but rather the "return from Action or Maintenance to an earlier stage".&lt;ref name=ProchaskaAJHP97/&gt;&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;In the 1983 version of the model, Relapse is considered one of the five stages of change.&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantitative definition of the stages of change (see below) is perhaps the most notorious feature of the model. However it is also one of the most critiqued, even in the field of smoking cessation, where it was originally formulated. It has been said that such quantitative definition (i.e. a person is in preparation if it intends to change within a month) does not reflect the nature of behaviour change, that it does not have better predictive power than simpler questions (i.e. "do you have plans to change..."), and that it has problems regarding its classification reliability.&lt;ref name="West 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=West |first=Robert |date=August 2005 |title=Time for a change: putting the Transtheoretical (Stages of Change) Model to rest |journal=[[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] |volume=100 |issue=8 |pages=1036–1039 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2005.01139.x |pmid=16042624}} See also the responses to West in the same issue: {{doi|10.1111/add.2005.100.issue-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication theorist and sociologist [[Everett Rogers]] suggested that the stages of change are analogues of the stages of the [[Diffusion of innovations#Process|innovation adoption process]] in Rogers' theory of [[diffusion of innovations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rogers |first=Everett M. |authorlink=Everett Rogers |date=2003 |origyear=1962 |title=Diffusion of innovations |edition=5th |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |isbn=0743222091 |oclc=52030797 |pages=198–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People at this stage do not intend to start the healthy behavior in the near future (within 6 months), and may be unaware of the need to change. People here learn more about healthy behavior: they are encouraged to think about the pros of changing their behavior and to feel emotions about the effects of their negative behavior on others.

Precontemplators typically underestimate the pros of changing, overestimate the cons, and often are not aware of making such mistakes.

One of the most effective steps that others can help with at this stage is to encourage them to become more mindful of their decision making and more conscious of the multiple benefits of changing an unhealthy behavior.

'''Stage 2: Contemplation''' (getting ready)

At this stage, participants are intending to start the healthy behavior within the next 6 months. While they are usually now more aware of the pros of changing, their cons are about equal to their Pros. This ambivalence about changing can cause them to keep putting off taking action.

People here learn about the kind of person they could be if they changed their behavior and learn more from people who behave in healthy ways.

Others can influence and help effectively at this stage by encouraging them to work at reducing the cons of changing their behavior.

'''Stage 3: Preparation''' (ready)

People at this stage are ready to start taking action within the next 30 days. They take small steps that they believe can help them make the healthy behavior a part of their lives. For example, they tell their friends and family that they want to change their behavior.

People in this stage should be encouraged to seek support from friends they trust, tell people about their plan to change the way they act, and think about how they would feel if they behaved in a healthier way. Their number one concern is: when they act, will they fail? They learn that the better prepared they are, the more likely they are to keep progressing.

'''Stage 4: Action''' (current action)

People at this stage have changed their behavior within the last 6 months and need to work hard to keep moving ahead. These participants need to learn how to strengthen their commitments to change and to fight urges to slip back.

People in this stage progress by being taught techniques for keeping up their commitments such as substituting activities related to the unhealthy behavior with positive ones, rewarding themselves for taking steps toward changing, and avoiding people and situations that tempt them to behave in unhealthy ways.

'''Stage 5: Maintenance''' (monitoring)

People at this stage changed their behavior more than 6 months ago. It is important for people in this stage to be aware of situations that may tempt them to slip back into doing the unhealthy behavior—particularly stressful situations.

It is recommended that people in this stage seek support from and talk with people whom they trust, spend time with people who behave in healthy ways, and remember to engage in healthy activities to cope with stress instead of relying on unhealthy behavior.

Relapse in the TTM specifically applies to individuals who successfully quit smoking or using drugs or alcohol, only to resume these unhealthy behaviors. Individuals who attempt to quit highly addictive behaviors such as drug, alcohol, and tobacco use are at particularly high risk of a relapse. Achieving a long-term behavior change often requires ongoing support from family members, a health coach, a physician, or another motivational source. Supportive literature and other resources can also be helpful to avoid a relapse from happening.

===Processes of change===
[[File:Processes of Change 3.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Processes of change]]
The 10 processes of change are "covert and overt activities that people use to progress through the stages".&lt;ref name=ProchaskaAJHP97/&gt;

To progress through the early stages, people apply cognitive, affective, and evaluative processes. As people move toward Action and Maintenance, they rely more on commitments, conditioning, contingencies, environmental controls, and support.&lt;ref name=Prochaskaabcd&gt;Prochaska, JO; Redding, CA; Evers, KE. The Transtheoretical Model and Stages of Change. In: Glanz, K; Rimer, BK; Viswanath, K. (eds.) Health Behavior and Health Education. 4th ed. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass; 2008. p. 105. {{ISBN|978-0-7879-9614-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prochaska and colleagues state that their research related to the transtheoretical model shows that interventions to change behavior are more effective if they are "stage-matched", that is, "matched to each individual's stage of change".&lt;ref name=ProchaskaAJHP97/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In the 1983 version of the model, the processes of change were said to be emphasized in only the Contemplation, Action, and Maintenance stages.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, for people to progress they need:
* A growing awareness that the advantages (the "pros") of changing outweigh the disadvantages (the "cons")—the TTM calls this ''decisional balance''.
* Confidence that they can make and maintain changes in situations that tempt them to return to their old, unhealthy behavior—the TTM calls this ''self-efficacy''.
* Strategies that can help them make and maintain change—the TTM calls these ''processes of change''.

The ten ''processes of change'' include:
# Consciousness-raising (Get the facts) — increasing awareness via information, education, and personal feedback about the healthy behavior.
# Dramatic relief (Pay attention to feelings) — feeling fear, anxiety, or worry because of the unhealthy behavior, or feeling inspiration and hope when they hear about how people are able to change to healthy behaviors.
# Self-reevaluation (Create a new self-image) — realizing that the healthy behavior is an important part of who they are and want to be.
# Environmental reevaluation (Notice your effect on others) — realizing how their unhealthy behavior affects others and how they could have more positive effects by changing.
# Social liberation (Notice public support) — realizing that society is more supportive of the healthy behavior.
# Self-liberation (Make a commitment) — believing in one's ability to change and making commitments and re-commitments to act on that belief.
# Helping relationships (Get support) — finding people who are supportive of their change.
# Counter-conditioning (Use substitutes) — substituting healthy ways of acting and thinking for unhealthy ways.
# Reinforcement management (Use rewards) — increasing the rewards that come from positive behavior and reducing those that come from negative behavior.
# Stimulus control (Manage your environment) — using reminders and cues that encourage healthy behavior as substitutes for those that encourage the unhealthy behavior.

Health researchers have extended Prochaska's and DiClemente's 10 original processes of change by an additional 21 processes. In the first edition of ''Planning Health Promotion Programs'',&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bartholomew, L.K.K., Parcel, G.S.S., Kok, G., Gottlieb, N.H.H., 2006. ''Planning Health Promotion Programs: An Intervention Mapping Approach''. 1st ed. San Franscisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Bartholomew et al. (2006) summarised the processes that they identified in a number of studies;&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; however, their extended list of processes was removed from later editions of the text. The additional processes of Bartholomew et al. were:&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;
# Risk comparison (Understand the risks) – comparing risks with similar dimensional profiles: dread, control, catastrophic potential and novelty
# Cumulative risk (Get the overall picture) – processing cumulative probabilities instead of single incident probabilities
# Qualitative and quantitative risks (Consider different factors) – processing different expressions of risk
# Positive framing (Think positively) – focusing on success instead of failure framing
# Self-examination relate to risk (Be aware of your risks) – conducting an assessment of risk perception, e.g. personalisation, impact on others
# Reevaluation of outcomes (Know the outcomes) – emphasising positive outcomes of alternative behaviours and reevaluating outcome expectancies
# Perception of benefits (Focus on benefits) – perceiving advantages of the healthy behaviour and disadvantages of the risk behaviour
# Self-efficacy and social support (Get help) – mobilising social support; skills training on coping with emotional disadvantages of change
# Decision making perspective (Decide) – focusing on making the decision
# Tailoring on time horizons (Set the time frame) – incorporating personal time horizons
# Focus on important factors (Prioritise) – incorporating personal factors of highest importance
# Trying out new behaviour (Try it) – changing something about oneself and gaining experience with that behaviour
# Persuasion of positive outcomes (Persuade yourself) – promoting new positive outcome expectations and reinforcing existing ones
# Modelling (Build scenarios) – showing models to overcome barriers effectively
# Skill improvement (Build a supportive environment) – restructuring environments to contain important, obvious and socially supported cues for the new behaviour
# Coping with barriers (Plan to tackle barriers) – identifying barriers and planning solutions when facing these obstacles
# Goal setting (Set goals) – setting specific and incremental goals
# Skills enhancement (Adapt your strategies) – restructuring cues and social support; anticipating and circumventing obstacles; modifying goals
# Dealing with barriers (Accept setbacks) – understanding that setbacks are normal and can be overcome
# Self-rewards for success (Reward yourself) – feeling good about progress; reiterating positive consequences
# Coping skills (Identify difficult situations) – identifying high risk situations; selecting solutions; practicing solutions; coping with relapse

While most of these processes are associated with health interventions such as smoking cessation and other addictive behaviour,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; some of them are also used in travel interventions.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Friman, M., Huck, J., Olsson, L., 2017. Transtheoretical Model of Change during Travel Behavior Interventions: An Integrative Review. International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health 14, 581-596.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the target behaviour the effectiveness of the process should differ. Also some processes are recommended in a specific stage, while others can be used in one or more stages. Recently, these processes have been identified in travel interventions, broadening the scope of TTM in other research domains.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

===Decisional balance===
{{Main article|Decisional balance sheet}}
This core construct "reflects the individual's relative weighing of the pros and cons of changing".&lt;ref name=ProchaskaAJHP97/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In the 1983 version of the model, "decisional balance" is absent. In the 1992 version of the model, Prochaska et al. mention "decisional balance" but in only one sentence under the "key transtheoretical concept" of "processes of change".&lt;/ref&gt; Decision making was conceptualized by Janis and Mann as a "[[decisional balance sheet]]" of comparative potential gains and losses.&lt;ref name=Janis1977&gt;Janis, I.L. &amp; Mann, L. (1977) Decision making: a psychological analysis of conflict, choice and commitment. New York: Free Press. {{ISBN|0-02-916160-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decisional balance measures, the pros and the cons, have become critical constructs in the transtheoretical model. The pros and cons combine to form a decisional "balance sheet" of comparative potential gains and losses. The balance between the pros and cons varies depending on which stage of change the individual is in.

Sound decision making requires the consideration of the potential benefits (pros) and costs (cons) associated with a behavior's consequences. TTM research has found the following relationships between the pros, cons, and the stage of change across 48 behaviors and over 100 populations studied.
* The cons of changing outweigh the pros in the Precontemplation stage.
* The pros surpass the cons in the middle stages.
* The pros outweigh the cons in the Action stage.&lt;ref name=HallRossi2008&gt;Hall, K.L. &amp; Rossi, J. S. (2008) Meta-analysis Examination of the sting and weak principals across 48 behaviors. Preventative Medicine, 46, 266-274.&lt;/ref&gt;

The evaluation of pros and cons is part of the formation of attitudes. [[Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]] is defined as a "psychological tendency that is expressed by evaluating a particular entity with some degree of favour or disfavour".&lt;ref&gt;Eagly, A.H., Chaiken, S., 1993. The psychology of attitudes. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich College Publishers, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; This means that by evaluating pros and cons we form a positive or negative attitude about something or someone. During the change process individuals gradually shift from cons to pros, forming a more positive attitude towards the target behaviour. Attitudes are one of the core constructs explaining behaviour and behaviour change in various research domains.&lt;ref&gt;Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., 1989. The Degree of Intention Formation as a Moderator of the Attitude-Behavior Relationship. Social Psychology Quarterly 52, 266-279.&lt;/ref&gt; Other behaviour models, such as the [[theory of planned behavior]] (TPB)&lt;ref&gt;Ajzen, I., 1991. The theory of planned behavior. Organizational behavior and human decision processes 50, 179-211.&lt;/ref&gt; and the stage model of self-regulated change,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Bamberg, S., 2013. Changing environmentally harmful behaviors: A stage model of self-regulated behavioral change. Journal of Environmental Psychology 34, 151-159.&lt;/ref&gt; also emphasise attitude as an important determinant of behaviour. The progression through the different stages of change is reflected in a gradual change in attitude before the individual acts. Most of the processes of change aim at evaluating and reevaluating as well as reinforcing specific elements of the current and target behaviour. The processes of change contribute to a great degree on attitude formation.

Due to the synonymous use of decisional balance and attitude, travel behaviour researchers have begun to combine the TTM with the TPB. Forward&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Forward, S.E., 2014. Exploring people's willingness to bike using a combination of the theory of planned behavioural and the transtheoretical model. Revue Européenne de Psychologie Appliquée/European Review of Applied Psychology 64, 151-159.&lt;/ref&gt; uses the TPB variables to better differentiate the different stages. Especially all TPB variables (attitude, perceived behaviour control, descriptive and subjective norm) are positively show a gradually increasing relationship to stage of change for bike commuting. As expected, intention or willingness to perform the behaviour increases by stage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Similarly, Bamberg&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; uses various behavior models, including the transtheoretical model, theory of planned behavior and norm-activation model, to build the stage model of self-regulated behavior change (SSBC). Bamberg claims that his model is a solution to criticism raised towards the TTM.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some researchers in travel, dietary, and environmental research have conducted empirical studies, showing that the SSBC might be a future path for TTM-based research.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klöckner, C.A., 2017. A stage model as an analysis framework for studying voluntary change in food choices: The case of beef consumption reduction in Norway. Appetite 108, 434-449.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klöckner, C.A., Nayum, A., 2016. Specific barriers and drivers in different stages of decision-making about energy efficiency upgrades in private homes. Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 7 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-efficacy===
This core construct is "the situation-specific confidence people have that they can cope with high-risk situations without relapsing to their unhealthy or high risk-habit".&lt;ref name=ProchaskaAJHP97/&gt;&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;In the 1983 version of the model, "self-efficacy" is absent. In the 1992 version of the model, Prochaska et al. mention "self-efficacy" but in only one sentence under the "key transtheoretical concept" of "stages of change".&lt;/ref&gt; The construct is based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory and conceptualizes a person's perceived ability to perform on a task as a mediator of performance on future tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Prochaska, J.O., Velicer, W.F., 1997. The transtheoretical model of health behavior change. American journal of health promotion 12, 38-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Bandura, A. (1977). Self-efficacy: toward a unifying theory of behavioral change. ''Psychological Review'', ''84''(2), 191-216.&lt;/ref&gt; In his research Bandura already established that greater levels of perceived self-efficacy leads to greater changes in behavior.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Similarly, Ajzen mentions the similarity between the concepts of self-efficacy and perceived behavioral control.&lt;ref&gt;Ajzen, I. (2002), Perceived Behavioral Control, Self-Efficacy, Locus of Control, and the Theory of Planned Behavior [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb00236.x/full#fn1 1]. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 32: 665–683. doi:10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb00236.x&lt;/ref&gt; This underlines the integrative nature of the transtheoretical model which combines various behavior theories. A change in the level of self-efficacy can predict a lasting change in behavior if there are adequate incentives and skills. The transtheoretical model employs an overall confidence score to assess an individual's self-efficacy. Situational temptations assess how tempted people are to engage in a problem behavior in a certain situation.

===Levels of change===
This core construct identifies the depth or complexity of presenting problems according to five levels of increasing complexity.&lt;ref name="Prochaska2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fromme2011"/&gt; Different therapeutic approaches are recommended for each level as well as for each stage of change.&lt;ref name="Prochaska2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prochaska1979"/&gt; The levels are:

#Symptom/situational problems: e.g., [[motivational interviewing]], [[behavior therapy]], [[exposure therapy]]
#Current maladaptive cognitions: e.g., [[Adlerian]] therapy, [[cognitive therapy]], [[rational emotive therapy]]
#Current interpersonal conflicts: e.g., [[Harry Stack Sullivan|Sullivanian]] therapy, [[interpersonal therapy]]
#Family/systems conflicts: e.g., [[strategic therapy]], [[Murray Bowen|Bowenian]] therapy, [[structural family therapy]]
#Long-term intrapersonal conflicts: e.g., [[psychoanalytic]] therapies, [[existential therapy]], [[Gestalt therapy]]

==Outcomes of programs==

The outcomes of the TTM computerized tailored interventions administered to participants in pre-Action stages are outlined below.

===Stress management===

A national sample of pre-Action adults was provided a stress management intervention. At the 18-month follow-up, a significantly larger proportion of the treatment group (62%) was effectively managing their stress when compared to the control group. The intervention also produced statistically significant reductions in stress and depression and an increase in the use of stress management techniques when compared to the control group.&lt;ref&gt;Evers, K. E., Prochaska, J. O., Johnson, J. L., Mauriello, L. M., Padula, J. A., &amp; Prochaska, J. M. (2006). A randomized clinical trial of a population- and transtheoretical model-based stress-management intervention. Health Psychol., 25, 521-529.&lt;/ref&gt; Two additional clinical trials of TTM programs by Prochaska et al. and Jordan et al. also found significantly larger proportions of treatment groups effectively managing stress when compared to control groups.&lt;ref name="Prochaska 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jordan, P.J. 2013"&gt;Jordan, P.J., Evers, K.E., Spira, J.L., King, L.A., &amp; Lid, V. (2013). Computerized, tailored interventions improve outcomes and reduce barriers to care. Poster presented at the 17th Annual International meeting and Exposition of the American Telemedicine Association in Austin, TX, May 5–7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adherence to antihypertensive medication===

Over 1,000 members of a New England group practice who were prescribed antihypertensive medication participated in an adherence to antihypertensive medication intervention. The vast majority (73%) of the intervention group who were previously pre-Action were adhering to their prescribed medication regimen at the 12-month follow-up when compared to the control group.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, S. S., Driskell, M. M., Johnson, J. L., Prochaska, J. M., Zwick, W., &amp; Prochaska, J. O. (2006b). Efficacy of a transtheoretical model-based expert system for antihypertensive adherence. Disease Management, 9, 291-301.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adherence to lipid-lowering drugs===

Members of a large New England health plan and various employer groups who were prescribed a cholesterol lowering medication participated in an adherence to lipid-lowering drugs intervention. More than half of the intervention group (56%) who were previously pre-Action were adhering to their prescribed medication regimen at the 18-month follow-up. Additionally, only 15% of those in the intervention group who were already in Action or Maintenance relapsed into poor medication adherence compared to 45% of the controls. Further, participants who were at risk for physical activity and unhealthy diet were given only stage-based guidance. The treatment group doubled the control group in the percentage in Action or Maintenance at 18 months for physical activity (43%) and diet (25%).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, S. S., Driskell, M. M., Johnson, J. L., Dyment, S. J., Prochaska, J. O., Prochaska, J. M. et al. (2006a). Transtheoretical model intervention for adherence to lipid-lowering drugs. Disease Management, 9, 102-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depression prevention===

Participants were 350 primary care patients experiencing at least mild depression but not involved in treatment or planning to seek treatment for depression in the next 30 days. Patients receiving the TTM intervention experienced significantly greater symptom reduction during the 9-month follow-up period. The intervention's largest effects were observed among patients with moderate or severe depression, and who were in the Precontemplation or Contemplation stage of change at baseline. For example, among patients in the Precontemplation or Contemplation stage, rates of reliable and clinically significant improvement in depression were 40% for treatment and 9% for control. Among patients with mild depression, or who were in the Action or Maintenance stage at baseline, the intervention helped prevent disease progression to Major Depression during the follow-up period.&lt;ref&gt;Levesque, D. A., Van Marter, D. F., Schneider, R. J., Bauer, M. R., Goldberg, D. N., Prochaska, J. O., &amp; Prochaska, J. M. (2011). Randomized trial of a computer-tailored intervention for patients with depression. ''American Journal of Health Promotion'', ''26''(2), 77-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weight management===

Fifty-hundred-and-seventy-seven overweight or moderately obese adults (BMI 25-39.9) were recruited nationally, primarily from large employers. Those randomly assigned to the treatment group received a stage-matched multiple behavior change guide and a series of tailored, individualized interventions for three health behaviors that are crucial to effective weight management: healthy eating (i.e., reducing calorie and dietary fat intake), moderate exercise, and managing emotional distress without eating. Up to three tailored reports (one per behavior) were delivered based on assessments conducted at four time points: baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. All participants were followed up at 6, 12, and 24 months. Multiple Imputation was used to estimate missing data. Generalized Labor Estimating Equations (GLEE) were then used to examine differences between the treatment and comparison groups. At 24 months, those who were in a pre-Action stage for healthy eating at baseline and received treatment were significantly more likely to have reached Protons or Maintenance than the comparison group (47.5% vs. 34.3%). The intervention also impacted a related, but untreated behavior: fruit and vegetable consumption. Over 48% of those in the treatment group in a pre-Action stage at baseline progressed to Action or Maintenance for eating at least 5 servings a day of fruit and vegetables as opposed to 39% of the comparison group. Individuals in the treatment group who were in a pre-Action stage for exercise at baseline were also significantly more likely to reach Action or Maintenance (44.9% vs. 38.1%). The treatment also had a significant effect on managing emotional distress without eating, with 49.7% of those in a pre-Action stage at baseline moving to Action or Maintenance versus 30.3% of the comparison group. The groups differed on weight lost at 24 months among those in a pre-action stage for healthy eating and exercise at baseline. Among those in a pre-Action stage for both healthy eating and exercise at baseline, 30% of those randomized to the treatment group lost 5% or more of their body weight vs.18.6% in the comparison group. Coaction of behavior change occurred and was much more pronounced in the treatment group with the treatment group losing significantly more than the comparison group. This study demonstrates the ability of TTM-based tailored feedback to improve healthy eating, exercise, managing emotional distress, and weight on a population basis. The treatment produced the highest population impact to date on multiple health risk behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, S. S., Paiva, A. L., Cummins, C. O., Johnson, J. L., Dyment, S. J., Wright, J.

Preventive Medicine, 46, 238-246.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smoking cessation===

Multiple studies have found individualized interventions tailored on the 14 TTM variables for smoking cessation to effectively recruit and retain pre-Action participants and produce long-term abstinence rates within the range of 22% – 26%. These interventions have also consistently outperformed alternative interventions including best-in-class action-oriented self-help programs,&lt;ref&gt;Prochaska, J. O., DiClemente, C.

====Example for TTM application on smoke control====
In the treatment of smoke control, TTM focuses on each stage to monitor and to achieve a progression to the next stage.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uri.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prochaska, JO; DiClemente, CC; Velicer, WF; Rossi, JS.

In each stage, a patient may have multiple sources that could influence their behavior. These may include: friends, books, and interactions with their healthcare providers. These factors could potentially influence how successful a patient may be in moving through the different stages. This stresses the importance to have continuous monitoring and efforts to maintain progress at each stage. TTM helps guide the treatment process at each stage, and may assist the healthcare provider in making an optimal therapeutic decision.

=== Travel research ===
The use of TTM in travel behaviour interventions is rather novel. A number of cross-sectional studies investigated the individual constructs of TTM, e.g. stage of change, decisional balance and self-efficacy, with regards to transport mode choice. The cross-sectional studies identified both motivators and barriers at the different stages regarding biking, walking and public transport.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Mutrie, N.; Carney, C.; Blamey, A.; Crawford, F.; Aitchison, T.; Whitelaw, A.

Promoting sustainable transportation across campus communities using the transtheoretical model of change. Commun. commons 2013, 427–438.&lt;/ref&gt; The motivators identified were e.g. liking to bike/walk, avoiding congestion and improved fitness. Perceived barriers were e.g. personal fitness, time and the weather. This knowledge was used to design interventions that would address attitudes and misconceptions to encourage an increased use of bikes and walking. These interventions aim at changing people's travel behaviour towards more sustainable and more active transport modes. In health-related studies, TTM is used to help people walk or bike more instead of using the car.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diniz, I.; Duarte, M.; Peres, K.; de Oliveira, E.; Berndt, A.

Sci. 2013, 87, 31–43.&lt;/ref&gt; By reducing single occupied motor vehicle and replacing them with so called [[sustainable transport]] ([[public transport]], [[car pooling]], [[biking]] or [[walking]]), [[greenhouse gas emissions]] can be reduced considerably. A reduction in the number of cars on our roads solves other problems such as congestion, traffic noise and traffic accidents. By combining health and environment related purposes, the message becomes stronger. Additionally, by emphasising personal health, physical activity or even direct economic impact, people see a direct result from their changed behaviour, while saving the environment is a more general and effects are not directly noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, C.

Board 2007, 2021, 89–99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rissel, C.E.; New, C.;Wen, L.M.; Merom, D.; Bauman, A.E.; Garrard, J.

Different outcome measures were used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Health-centred intervention studies measured BMI, weight, waist circumference as well as general health. However, only one of three found a significant change in general health, while BMI and other measures had no effect.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Measures that are associated with both health and sustainability were more common. Effects were reported as number of car trips, distance travelled, main mode share etc. Results varied due to greatly differing approaches. In general, car use could be reduced between 6% and 55%, while use of the alternative mode (walking, biking and/or public transport) increased between 11% and 150%.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; These results indicate a shift to action or maintenance stage, some researchers investigated attitude shifts such as the willingness to change. Attitudes towards using alternative modes improved with approximately 20% to 70%.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Many of the intervention studies did not clearly differentiate between the five stages, but categorised participants in pre-action and action stage. This approach makes it difficult to assess the effects per stage. Also, interventions included different processes of change; in many cases these processes are not matched to the recommended stage.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; It highlights the need to develop a standardised approach for travel intervention design. Identifying and assessing which processes are most effective in the context of travel behaviour change should be a priority in the future in order to secure the role of TTM in travel behaviour research.

==Criticisms==
The TTM has been called "arguably the dominant model of health behaviour change, having received unprecedented research attention, yet it has simultaneously attracted criticism".&lt;ref name="Armitage"/&gt; Depending on the field of application (e.g. smoking cessation, substance abuse, condom use, diabetes treatment, obesity and travel) somewhat different criticisms have been raised.

In a [[systematic review]], published in 2003, of 23 [[randomized controlled trial]]s, the authors found that "stage based interventions are no more effective than non-stage based interventions or no intervention in changing [[smoking]] behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Riemsma, RP; Pattenden, J; Bridle, C; Sowden, AJ; Mather, L; Watt, IS; Walker, A. [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/326/7400/1175 Systematic review of the effectiveness of stage based interventions to promote smoking cessation.] BMJ 2003 May 31;326(7400):1175–7. Accessed 2009 Mar 18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was also mentioned that stage based interventions are often used and implemented inadequately in practice. Thus, criticism is directed towards the use rather the effectiveness of the model itself. Looking at interventions targeting smoking cessation in pregnancy found that stage-matched interventions were more effective than non-matched interventions. One reason for this was the greater intensity of stage-matched interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Aveyard, P; Lawrence, T; Cheng, KK; Griffin, C; Croghan, E; Johnson, C. [http://www.haps.bham.ac.uk/primarycare/cv/smoking/docs/pregnancystage.pdf A randomized controlled trial of smoking cessation for pregnant women to test the effect of a transtheoretical model-based intervention on movement in stage and interaction with baseline stage.] Br J Health Psychol 2006 May;11(Pt 2):263–78. Accessed 2009 Mar 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the use of stage-based interventions for smoking cessation in mental illness proved to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S.M., Tsoh, J.Y., Prochaska, J.J., Eisendrath, S., Rossi, J.S., Redding, C.A., Rosen, A.B., Meisner, M., Humfleet, G.L., Gorecki, J.A., 2006. Treatment for Cigarette Smoking Among Depressed Mental Health Outpatients: A Randomized Clinical Trial. American Journal of Public Health 96, 1808-1814.&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies, e.g. a randomized controlled trial published in 2009, found no evidence that a TTM based smoking cessation intervention was more effective than a control intervention not tailored to stage of change. The study claims that those not wanting to change (i.e. precontemplators) tend to be responsive to neither stage nor non-stage based interventions. Since stage-based interventions tend to be more intensive they appear to be most effective at targeting contemplators and above rather than pre-contemplators.&lt;ref&gt;Aveyard, P; Massey, L; Parsons, A; Manaseki, S; Griffin, C. [[doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.10.036|The effect of transtheoretical model based interventions on smoking cessation.]] Soc Sci Med 2009 Feb;68(3):397–403. Accessed 2009 Mar 18.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 systematic review of [[smoking cessation]] studies under the auspices of the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found that "stage-based self-help interventions (expert systems and/or tailored materials) and individual counselling were neither more nor less effective than their non-stage-based equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, K; Lancaster, T; Green, N. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21069681 Stage-based interventions for smoking cessation.] Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2010 Nov 10;11:CD004492. [[PubMed Identifier|PMID]] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21069681 21069681]. Accessed 2011 Feb 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Main criticism is raised regarding the "arbitrary dividing lines" that are drawn between the stages. West claimed that a more coherent and distinguishable definition for the stages is needed.&lt;ref name="West 2005"/&gt; Especially the fact that the stages are bound to a specific time interval is perceived to be misleading. Additionally, the effectiveness of stage-based interventions differs depending on the behavior. A continuous version of the model has been proposed, where each process is first increasingly used, and then decreases in importance, as smokers make progress along some latent dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Noël |first=Yvonnick |date=June 1999 |title=Recovering unimodal latent patterns of change by unfolding analysis: application to smoking cessation |journal=[[Psychological Methods]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=173–191 |doi=10.1037/1082-989X.4.2.173}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal suggests the use of processes without reference to stages of change.

The model "assumes that individuals typically make coherent and stable plans", when in fact they often do not.&lt;ref name="West 2005"/&gt;

Within research on prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases a systematic review from 2003 comes to the conclusion that "no strong conclusions" can be drawn about the effectiveness of interventions based on the transtheoretical model.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Horowitz, SM. [http://hpp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/7/4/428 Applying the transtheoretical model to pregnancy and STD prevention: a review of the literature.] Am J Health Promot 2003 May–Jun;17(5):304–28. Accessed 2009 Mar 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Again this conclusion is reached due to the inconsistency of use and implementation of the model.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This study also confirms that the better stage-matched the intervention the more effect it has to encourage condom use.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Within the health research domain, a 2005 systematic review of 37 randomized controlled trials claims that "there was limited evidence for the effectiveness of stage-based interventions as a basis for behavior change.&lt;ref&gt;Bridle, C; Riemsma, RP; Pattenden, J; Sowden, AJ; Mather, L; Watt, IS; Walker, A. [http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/med/staff/bridle/download/ttm_interventions_ph_05.pdf Systematic review of the effectiveness of health behavior interventions based on the transtheoretical model.]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Psychol Health 2005;20:283–301. Accessed 2009 Mar 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies with which focused on increasing physical activity levels through active commute however showed that stage-matched interventions tended to have slightly more effect than non-stage matched interventions.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; Since many studies do not use all constructs of the TTM, additional research suggested that the effectiveness of interventions increases the better it is tailored on all core constructs of the TTM in addition to stage of change.&lt;ref&gt;Prochaska JO. Moving beyond the transtheoretical model. Addiction 2006 Jun;101(6):768-74&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] research the "existing data are insufficient for drawing conclusions on the benefits of the transtheoretical model" as related to dietary interventions. Again, studies with slightly different design, e.g. using different processes, proved to be effective in predicting the stage transition of intention to exercise in relation to treating patients with diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, A., MacMillan, F., Webster, N., 2010. Application of the Transtheoretical model to physical activity in older adults with Type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. Psychology of Sport and Exercise 11, 320-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

TTM has generally found a greater popularity regarding research on physical activity, due to the increasing problems associated with unhealthy diets and sedentary living, e.g. obesity, cardiovascular problems.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, L., Adams, T.B., Malone, S., Roy, L., Yost, E., 2006. Applying the transtheoretical model to exercise: a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature. Health promotion practice 7, 428-443.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 Cochrane Systematic Review found that there is little evidence to suggest that using the Transtheoretical Model Stages of Change (TTM SOC) method is effective in helping obese and overweight people lose weight. Earlier in a 2009 paper, the TTM was considered to be useful in promoting physical activity. In this study, the algorithms and questionnaires that researchers used to assign people to stages of change lacked standardisation to be compared empirically, or validated.&lt;ref&gt;Sallis, J. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2879180/ Physical Activity and Food Environments: Solutions to the Obesity Epidemic.] Milbank Q. 2009 Mar; 87(1): 123–154. Accessed 2010 Mar 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="West 2005"/&gt;

Similar criticism regarding the standardisation as well as consistency in the use of TTM is also raised in a recent review on travel interventions.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; With regard to travel interventions only stages of change and sometimes decisional balance constructs are included. The processes used to build the intervention are rarely stage-matched and short cuts are taken by classifying participants in a pre-action stage, which summarises the precontemplation, contemplation and preparation stage, and an action/maintenance stage.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; More generally, TTM has been criticised within various domains due to the limitations in the research designs. For example, many studies supporting the model have been [[Cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]], but [[longitudinal study]] data would allow for stronger causal inferences. Another point of criticism is raised in a 2002 review, where the model's stages were characterized as "not mutually exclusive".&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;Littell, JH; Girvin, H. [http://bmo.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/26/2/223 Stages of change. A critique.] Behav Modif 2002 Apr;26(2):223–73. Accessed 2009 Mar 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there was "scant evidence of sequential movement through discrete stages".&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; While research suggests that movement through the stages of change is not always linear, a study conducted in 1996 demonstrated that the probability of forward stage movement is greater than the probability of backward stage movement.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, R., Velicer, WF, Fava, JL. Latent transition analysis to the stages of change for smoking cessation. Addictive Behaviors 1996, 21(1):67-80&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the variations in use, implementation and type of research designs, data confirming TTM are ambiguous. More care has to be taken in using a sufficient amount of constructs, trustworthy measures, and longitudinal data.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

[[File:Nowa Huta jako idealne socjalistyczne miasto.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Nowa Huta]] in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], serves as an unfinished example of a Utopian [[ideal city]].]]

A '''utopia''' ({{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|t|oʊ|p|i|ə}} {{respell|yoo|TOH|pee|ə}}) is an imagined [[community]] or [[society]] that possesses highly desirable or nearly perfect qualities for its citizens.&lt;ref name="Giroux, H. 2003. pp. 91-105"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giroux |first=Henry A. |authorlink=Henry  Giroux |date=2003 |title=Utopian thinking under the sign of neoliberalism: Towards a critical pedagogy of educated hope |url=https://uniteyouthdublin.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/giroux-utopian-thinking-under-the-sign-of-neoliberalism-towards-a-critical-pedagogy-of-e.pdf |journal=[[Democracy &amp; Nature]] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=91–105 |doi=10.1080/1085566032000074968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;Simandan, D., 2011.

One could also say that utopia is a perfect "place" that has been designed so there are no problems.

Utopia focuses on equality in [[economics]], [[government]] and [[justice]], though by no means exclusively, with the method and structure of proposed implementation varying based on ideology.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giroux, H. 2003. pp.91-105"&gt;Giroux, H., 2003.

If any two desires cannot be simultaneously satisfied, true utopia cannot be attained because in utopia all desires are satisfied.

The term ''[[Wiktionary:utopia|utopia]]'' was coined from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] by [[Sir Thomas More]] for his 1516 book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', describing a [[fictional island]] society in the south [[Atlantic Ocean]] off the coast of [[South America]].

The word comes from {{lang-el|οὐ}} ("not") and τόπος ("place") and means "no-place", and strictly describes any non-existent society 'described in considerable detail'. However, in standard usage, the word's meaning has [[semantic change|narrowed]] and now usually describes a non-existent society that is intended to be viewed as considerably better than contemporary society.&lt;ref name="Thinking Utopia"&gt;{{cite report|periodical=Thinking Utopia: Steps Into Other Worlds|pages=11|first=Sargent|last=Lyman Tower|title=The Necessity of Utopian Thinking: A Cross-National Perspective|editor1-last=Rüsen|editor1-first=Jörn |editor2-last=Fehr|editor2-first=Michael|editor3-last=Reiger|editor3-first=Thomas W.|year=2005|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781571814401|location=New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eutopia'', derived from Greek εὖ ("good" or "well") and τόπος ("place"), means "good place", and is strictly speaking the correct term to describe a positive utopia. In [[English language|English]], ''eutopia'' and ''utopia'' are homophonous, which may have given rise to the change in meaning.&lt;ref name="Thinking Utopia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Utopian Reality: Reconstructing Culture in Revolutionary Russia and Beyond|last=Lodder|first=C.|last2=Kokkori|first2=M|last3=Mileeva|first3=M|pages=1–9|isbn=9789004263208|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronologically, the first recorded Utopian proposal is [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;More, Travis; Rohith Vinod
(1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Part conversation, part fictional depiction, and part policy proposal, ''Republic'' would categorize citizens into a rigid class structure of "golden," "silver," "bronze" and "iron" socioeconomic classes. The golden citizens are trained in a rigorous 50-year-long educational program to be benign oligarchs, the "philosopher-kings."  Plato stressed this structure many times in statements, and in his published works, such as the ''Republic''.  The wisdom of these rulers will supposedly eliminate poverty and deprivation through fairly distributed resources, though the details on how to do this are unclear.  The educational program for the rulers is the central notion of the proposal.  It has few laws, no [[lawyer]]s and rarely sends its citizens to war, but hires [[mercenary|mercenaries]] from among its war-prone neighbors.  These mercenaries were deliberately sent into dangerous situations in the hope that the more warlike populations of all surrounding countries will be weeded out, leaving peaceful peoples.

During the 16th century, Thomas More's book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' proposed an ideal society of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126618.html|title=Thomas More's Utopia|website=www.bl.uk|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers, including Utopian socialists, have chosen to accept this imaginary society as the realistic blueprint for a working nation, while others have postulated that Thomas More intended nothing of the sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utopiaanddystopia.com/utopia/utopian-socialism/|title=Utopian Socialism - The Utopian Socialism Movement |website=www.utopiaanddystopia.com |accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that More's ''Utopia'' functions only on the level of a satire, a work intended to reveal more about the [[England]] of his time than about an idealistic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dalley |first=Jan |url=https://www.ft.com/content/73b9bed6-a7ea-11e5-955c-1e1d6de94879 |title=Openings: Going back to Utopia |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=30 December 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is bolstered by the title of the book and nation, and its apparent confusion between the Greek for "no place" and "good place": "utopia" is a compound of the syllable ou-, meaning "no", and topos, meaning place. But the [[Homophone|homophonic]] prefix eu-, meaning "good," also resonates in the word, with the implication that the perfectly "good place" is really "no place."

===Ecological===
Ecological utopian society describes new ways in which society should relate to nature.
These works [[ecotopia|perceive]] a widening gap between the modern Western way of living that destroys nature&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Andrew G. (2007). ''Counterculture green: the Whole earth catalog and American environmentalism''. University Press of Kansas. p. 86. {{ISBN|978-0-7006-1545-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a more traditional way of living before industrialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecotopia 2121: A Vision of our Future Green Utopia|last=For example, see: Marshall|first=Alan|publisher=Arcade Publishers|year=2016|isbn=9781628726145|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological utopias may advocate a society that is more sustainable. According to the Dutch philosopher Marius de Geus, ecological utopias could be inspirational sources for movements involving [[green politics]].&lt;ref&gt;Geus, Marius de (1996). Ecologische utopieën- Ecotopia's en het milieudebat. Uitgeverij Jan van Arkel.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
Particularly in the early 19th century, several utopian ideas arose, often in response to the belief that social disruption was created and caused by the development of [[commercialism]] and [[capitalism]]. These ideas are often grouped in a greater "[[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]]" movement, due to their shared characteristics.  A once common characteristic is an [[egalitarian]] distribution of goods, frequently with the total abolition of [[money]]. Citizens only do [[labour (economics)|work]] which they enjoy and which is for the [[common good]], leaving them with ample time for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. One classic example of such a utopia was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]''. Another socialist utopia is [[William Morris]]'s ''[[News from Nowhere]]'', written partially in response to the top-down ([[bureaucratic]]) nature of Bellamy's utopia, which Morris criticized. However, as the socialist movement developed, it moved away from utopianism; [[Marx]] in particular became a harsh critic of earlier socialism he described as utopian. (For more information, see the [[History of Socialism]] article.) In a materialist utopian society, the economy is perfect; there is no inflation, and only perfect social and financial equality exists.

In 1905, [[H.G. Wells]] published ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'', which was widely read and admired and provoked much discussion. Also consider [[Eric Frank Russell]]'s book ''[[The Great Explosion]]'' (1963) whose last section details an economic and social utopia. This forms the first mention of the idea of [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] (LETS).

During the "[[Khrushchev Thaw]]" period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-Thaw-Soviet-cultural-history|title=the Thaw - Soviet cultural history|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Soviet writer [[Ivan Yefremov|Ivan Efremov]] produced the science-fiction utopia ''[[Andromeda (novel)|Andromeda]]'' (1957) in which a major cultural thaw took place: humanity communicates with a galaxy-wide Great Circle and develops its technology and culture within a social framework characterized by vigorous competition between alternative philosophies.

The English political philosopher [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], author of the utopian work [[The Commonwealth of Oceana]], published in 1656, inspired English [[Country Party (Britain)|country party]] republicanism and was influential in the design of three American colonies. His theories ultimately contributed to the idealistic principles of the American Founders. The colonies of [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]] (founded in 1670), [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] (founded in 1681), and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] (founded in 1733) were the only three English colonies in America that were planned as utopian societies with an integrated physical, economic, and social design. At the heart of the plan for Georgia was a concept of “agrarian equality” in which land was allocated equally and additional land acquisition through purchase or inheritance was prohibited; the plan was an early step toward the yeoman republic later envisioned by Thomas Jefferson.&lt;ref&gt;Fries, Sylvia, ''The Urban Idea in Colonial America'', Chapters 3 and 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Home, Robert, ''Of Planting and Planning: The Making of British Colonial Cities'', 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas, ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', Chapters 1 and 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The communes of the 1960s in the United States were often an attempt to greatly improve the way humans live together in communities. The back-to-the-land movements and hippies inspired many to try to live in peace and harmony on farms, remote areas, and to set up new types of governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brbl-archive.library.yale.edu/exhibitions/utopia/uc22.html|title=America and the Utopian Dream - Utopian Communities|website=brbl-archive.library.yale.edu|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communes like [[Kaliflower Commune|Kaliflower]], which existed between 1967 and 1973, attempted to live outside of society's norms and create their own ideal communist based society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://secure.pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=432|title=For All the People: Uncovering the Hidden History of Cooperation, Cooperative Movements, and Communalism in America, 2nd Edition|website=secure.pmpress.org|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intentional communities]] were organized and built all over the world with the hope of making a more perfect way of living together. While many of these new small communities failed, some are growing, such as the [[Twelve Tribes Communities]] that started in the United States. Since its start, it has now grown into many groups around the world.

===Religious utopias===
[[File:New Harmony by F. Bate (View of a Community, as proposed by Robert Owen) printed 1838.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]], a Utopian attempt; depicted as proposed by [[Robert Owen]].]]

==== Inter-religious utopias ====
The inter-religious utopia is similar to a form of [[multiculturalism]] where real-world cultures have successfully worked together to create a wider society based on shared values. A transparent ideology of God and religion in an inter-religious utopia is how many people envision [[God]] manifesting within such a community.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In more extended theories, the formula goes up to the next level, with different [[religious leader]]s setting aside their differences and accepting harmony, peace and understanding to unite all [[religion]]s with one another.  Other inter-religious utopias may go even further by describing a religion where humans become God or merge with a primal force that reigned before the birth of the [[universe]]. Religion and God could be used as self-motivating factors for people to believe in and to raise themselves out of difficult situations.

==== Intra-religious utopias ====
In the United States and Europe, during the [[Second Great Awakening]] (ca. 1790–1840) and thereafter, many radical religious groups formed utopian societies in which [[faith]] could govern all aspects of members' lives. These utopian societies included the [[Shakers]], who originated in England in the 18th century and arrived in America in 1774. A number of religious utopian societies from Europe came to the United States from the 18th century throughout the 19th century, including the Society of the Woman in the Wilderness (led by [[Johannes Kelpius]] (1667–1708)), the [[Ephrata Cloister]] (established in 1732), and the [[Harmony Society]], among others.  The [[Harmony Society]] was a [[Christian theosophy]] and [[Pietism|pietist]] group founded in [[Iptingen]], [[Germany]], in 1785. Due to religious persecution by the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] and the government in [[Württemberg]],&lt;ref name="Sutton1"&gt;Robert Paul Sutton, ''Communal Utopias and the American Experience: Religious Communities'' (2003) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; the society moved to the United States on October 7, 1803, settled in [[Pennsylvania]].  On February 15, 1805, about 400 followers formally organized the Harmony Society, placing all their goods in common. The group lasted until 1905, making it one of the longest-running financially successful communes in American history. The [[Oneida Community]], founded by [[John Humphrey Noyes]] in [[Oneida, New York]], was a utopian religious [[commune]] that lasted from 1848 to 1881. Although this utopian experiment has become better known today for its manufacture of Oneida silverware, it was one of the longest-running communes in American history. The [[Amana Colonies]] were communal settlements in [[Iowa]], started by radical German [[pietists]], which lasted from 1855 to 1932. The [[Amana Corporation]], manufacturer of refrigerators and household appliances, was originally started by the group. Other examples are [[Fountain Grove, California|Fountain Grove]] (founded in 1875), Riker's Holy City and other Californian utopian colonies between 1855 and 1955 (Hine), as well as Sointula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Finnish Utopian Settlements in North America | author = Teuvo Peltoniemi | url = http://www.sosiomedia.fi/utopia/na_settlements.pdf | publisher = sosiomedia.fi | year = 1984 | accessdate = 2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[British Columbia]], Canada. The [[Amish]] and [[Hutterites]] can also be considered an attempt towards religious utopia.  A wide variety of [[intentional communities]] with some type of faith-based ideas have also started across the world.

===Science and technology===
[[File:Early flight 02561u (2).jpg|thumb|Utopian flying machines, France, 1890-1900 (chromolithograph [[trading card]]).]]

Though [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''New Atlantis'' is imbued with a scientific spirit, scientific and technological utopias tend to be based in the future, when it is believed that advanced [[science]] and [[technology]] will allow utopian [[living standards]]; for example, the absence of [[death]] and [[suffering]]; changes in [[human nature]] and the [[human condition]]. Technology has affected the way humans have lived to such an extent that normal functions, like sleep, eating or even reproduction, have been replaced by artificial means. Other examples include a society where humans have struck a balance with technology and it is merely used to enhance the human living condition (e.g. ''[[Star Trek]]''). In place of the static perfection of a utopia, [[libertarian transhumanist]]s envision an "[[extropianism|extropia]]", an open, evolving society allowing individuals and voluntary groupings to form the institutions and social forms they prefer.

[[Mariah Utsawa]] presented a theoretical basis for [[technological utopianism]] and set out to develop a variety of technologies ranging from maps to designs for cars and houses which might lead to the development of such a utopia.

One notable example of a technological and [[libertarian socialist]] utopia is Scottish author [[Iain Banks]]' [[The Culture|Culture]].

Opposing this [[optimism]] is the prediction that advanced science and technology will, through deliberate misuse or accident, cause environmental damage or even humanity's [[extinction]]. Critics, such as [[Jacques Ellul]] and [[Timothy Mitchell]] advocate [[precautionary principle|precautions]] against the premature embrace of new technologies.  Both raise questions about changing responsibility and freedom brought by [[division of labour]]. Authors such as [[John Zerzan]] and [[Derrick Jensen]] consider that modern technology is progressively depriving humans of their autonomy, and advocate the collapse of the industrial civilization, in favor of small-scale organization, as a necessary path to avoid the threat of technology on human freedom and [[sustainability]].

There are many examples of techno-dystopias portrayed in mainstream culture, such as the classics ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]],'' often published as "1984", which have explored some of these topics.

===Feminism===
Utopias have been used to explore the ramifications of genders being either a societal construct, or a biologically "hard-wired" imperative, or some mix of the two.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442&gt;{{cite book |title= Women's Studies Encyclopedia|last=Tierney |first=Helen |authorlink=  |year= 1999|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|page=1442 |isbn=978-0-313-31073-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialist and economic utopias have tended to take the "woman question" seriously, and often to offer some form of equality between the sexes as part and parcel of their vision, whether this be by addressing misogyny, reorganizing society along separatist lines, creating a certain kind of androgynous equality that ignores gender, or in some other manner. For example, [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]'' (1887) responded, progressively for his day, to the contemporary women's suffrage and women's rights movements. Bellamy supported these movements by incorporating the equality of women and men into his utopian world's structure, albeit by consigning women to a separate sphere of light industrial activity (due to women's  lesser physical strength), and making various exceptions for them in order to make room for (and to praise) motherhood. One of the earlier feminist utopias that imagines complete separatism is [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' (1915).

In [[Gender in speculative fiction|science fiction and technological speculation]], gender can be challenged on the biological as well as the social level. [[Marge Piercy]]'s ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]'' portrays equality between the genders and complete equality in sexuality (regardless of the gender of the lovers).  Birth-giving, often felt as the divider that cannot be avoided in discussions of women's rights and roles, has been shifted onto elaborate biological machinery that functions to offer an enriched embryonic experience,  When a child is born, it spends most of its time in the children's ward with peers. Three "mothers" per child are the norm, and they are chosen in a gender neutral way (men as well as women may become "mothers") on the basis of their experience and ability. Technological advances also make possible the freeing of women from childbearing in [[Shulamith Firestone]]'s ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]''. The fictional aliens in [[Mary Gentle]]'s ''Golden Witchbreed'' start out as gender-neutral children and do not develop into men and women until puberty, and gender has no bearing on social roles. In contrast, [[Doris Lessing]]'s ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]'' (1980) suggests that men's and women's values are inherent to the sexes and cannot be changed, making a compromise between them essential. In ''My Own Utopia'' (1961) by [[Elizabeth Mann Borghese]], gender exists but is dependent upon age rather than sex&amp;nbsp;— genderless children mature into women, some of whom eventually become men.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442/&gt; "[[William Moulton Marston|William Marston]]'s [[Wonder Woman]] comics of the 1940s featured Paradise Island, also known as [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], a matriarchal all-female community of peace, loving submission, bondage, and giant space kangaroos."&lt;ref&gt;Noah Berlatsky, "Imagine There's No Gender: The Long History of Feminist Utopian Literature," ''The Atlantic,'' April 15, 2013. https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/imagine-theres-no-gender-the-long-history-of-feminist-utopian-literature/274993/&lt;/ref&gt;

Utopian [[single-gender worlds]] or single-sex societies have long been one of the primary ways to explore implications of gender and gender-differences.&lt;ref name=DGinSF13/&gt; In speculative fiction, female-only worlds have been imagined to come about by the action of disease that wipes out men, along with the development of technological or mystical method that allow female [[parthenogenic]] [[reproduction]]. Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 1915 novel approaches this type of separate society. Many feminist utopias pondering separatism were written in the 1970s, as a response to the [[Lesbian separatism|Lesbian separatist movement]];&lt;ref name=DGinSF13&gt;Attebery, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erotic1189&gt;[[Gaétan Brulotte]] &amp; John Phillips,''Encyclopedia of Erotic Literature'', "Science Fiction and Fantasy", CRC Press, 2006, p. 1189, {{ISBN|1-57958-441-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =Utop101/&gt; examples include [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[The Female Man]]'' and [[Suzy McKee Charnas]]'s ''[[Walk to the End of the World]]'' and ''[[Motherlines]]''.&lt;ref name =Utop101&gt;Martha A. Bartter, ''The Utopian Fantastic'', "Momutes", Robin Anne Reid, p.101 {{ISBN|0-313-31635-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utopias imagined by male authors have often included equality between sexes, rather than separation, although as noted Bellamy's strategy includes a certain amount of "separate but equal".&lt;ref name =Utop102&gt;Martha A. Bartter, ''The Utopian Fantastic'', "Momutes", Robin Anne Reid, p. 102 ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of female-only worlds allows the exploration of female independence and freedom from [[patriarchy]]. The societies may be lesbian, such as ''[[Daughters of a Coral Dawn]]'' by [[Katherine V.

===Utopianism===
[[File:Goldenes-Zeitalter-1530-2.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|''[[The Golden Age (Cranach)|The Golden Age]]'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].]]
In many cultures, societies, and religions, there is some myth or memory of a distant past when humankind lived in a primitive and simple state, but at the same time one of perfect happiness and fulfillment. In those days, the various [[mythology|myth]]s tell us, there was an instinctive harmony between humanity and nature. People's needs were few and their desires limited. Both were easily satisfied by the abundance provided by nature. Accordingly, there were no motives whatsoever for war or oppression. Nor was there any need for hard and painful work. Humans were simple and [[piety|pious]], and felt themselves close to their God or gods. According to one anthropological theory, hunter-gatherers were the [[original affluent society]].

These mythical or religious archetypes are inscribed in many cultures, and resurge with special vitality when people are in difficult and critical times. However, in utopias, the projection of the myth does not take place towards the remote past, but either towards the future or towards distant and fictional places, imagining that at some time in the future, at some point in space, or beyond death, there must exist the possibility of living happily.

These myths of the earliest stage of humankind have been referred to by various cultures, societies, and religions:

====Golden Age====

The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]], around the 8th century BC, in his compilation of the mythological tradition (the poem ''[[Works and Days]]''), explained that, prior to [[Ages of Man|the present era]], there were four other progressively more perfect ones, the oldest of which was the [[Golden Age]].

[[Plutarch]], the Greek historian and biographer of the 1st century, dealt with the blissful and mythic past of the humanity.

====Arcadia====

From [[Sir Philip Sidney]]'s prose romance ''[[Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia|The Old Arcadia]]'' (1580), originally a region in the [[Peloponnesus]], [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] became a [[synonym]] for any rural area that serves as a [[pastoral]] setting, a ''locus amoenus'' ("delightful place").

====The Biblical Garden of Eden====

The [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] [[Garden of Eden]] as depicted in the [[Old Testament]] [[Bible]]'s [[Book of Genesis]] 2 ([[King James Version of the Bible|Authorized Version of 1611]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]] also in the midst of the garden, and the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|tree of knowledge of good and evil]]. [...]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. [...]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; [...] And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; and the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the exegesis that the biblical theologian [[Herbert Haag]] proposes in the book ''Is original sin in Scripture?'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haag |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Haag |title=Is original sin in Scripture? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zO_YAAAAMAAJ |year=1969 |publisher=[[Sheed and Ward]] |location=New York}} [[German language|German]] or. ed.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=EnWRSQAACAAJ 1966].&lt;/ref&gt; published soon after the [[Second Vatican Council]], {{bibleref2|Genesis 2:25||NIV}} would indicate that [[Adam and Eve]] were created from the beginning naked of the [[divine grace]], an originary grace that, then, they would never have had and even less would have lost due to the subsequent events narrated. On the other hand, while supporting a continuity in the Bible about the absence of [[preternatural]] gifts ({{lang-la|dona praeternaturalia}})&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Haag, Herbert (1966). pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nUMaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22dona+praeternaturalia%22 9, 49ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; with regard to the [[Serpents in the Bible#Eden|ophitic event]], Haag never makes any reference to the discontinuity of the loss of access to the tree of life.

====The Land of Cockaigne====

The Land of [[Cockaigne]] (also Cockaygne, Cokaygne), was an imaginary land of idleness and luxury, famous in medieval stories, and the subject of several poems, one of which, an early translation of a 13th-century French work, is given in [[George Ellis (poet)|George Ellis']] ''Specimens of Early English Poets''. In this, "the houses were made of barley sugar and cakes, the streets were paved with pastry, and the shops supplied goods for nothing."  London has been so called (see [[Cockney#Cockaigne|Cockney]]), but Boileau applies the same to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Cobham Brewer E. ''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', Odhams, London, 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Peach Blossom Spring====
The [[Peach Blossom Spring]], a prose written by the Chinese writer [[Tao Yuanming]] (c. 220 - 589 CE), describes a utopian place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Tian| first=Xiaofei| title=The Cambridge History of Chinese Literature| year=2010| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge| isbn=978-0-521-85558-7| page=221| chapter=From the Eastern Jin through the Early Tang (317–649)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Berkowitz| first=Alan J.| title=Patterns of Disengagement: the Practice and Portrayal of Reclusion in Early Medieval China| year=2000| publisher=Stanford University Press| location=Stanford| isbn=978-0-8047-3603-9| page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative goes that a fisherman from Wuling sailed upstream a river and came across a beautiful blossoming peach grove and lush green fields covered with blossom petals.&lt;ref name=zh182&gt;{{cite book| last=Longxi| first=Zhang| title=Allegoresis: Reading Canonical Literature East and West| year=2005| publisher=Cornell University Press| location=Ithaca| isbn=978-0-8014-4369-5| page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entranced by the beauty, he continued upstream.&lt;ref name=zh182/&gt; When he reached the end of the river, he stumbled onto a small grotto.&lt;ref name=zh182/&gt; Though narrow at first, he was able to squeeze through the passage and discovered an ethereal utopia, where the people led an ideal existence in harmony with nature.&lt;ref name=zh182-3&gt;{{cite book| last=Longxi| first=Zhang| title=Allegoresis: Reading Canonical Literature East and West| year=2005| publisher=Cornell University Press| location=Ithaca| isbn=978-0-8014-4369-5| pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw a vast expanse of fertile lands, clear ponds, mulberry trees, bamboo groves, and the like with a community of people of all ages and houses in neat rows.&lt;ref name=zh182-3/&gt; The people explained that their ancestors escaped to this place during the civil unrest of the [[Qin dynasty]] and they themselves had not left since or had contact with anyone from the outside.&lt;ref name=zh183&gt;{{cite book| last=Longxi| first=Zhang| title=Allegoresis: Reading Canonical Literature East and West| year=2005| publisher=Cornell University Press| location=Ithaca| isbn=978-0-8014-4369-5| pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had not even heard of the later dynasties of bygone times or the then-current [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]].&lt;ref name=zh183/&gt; In the story, the community was secluded and unaffected by the troubles of the outside world.&lt;ref name=zh183/&gt; The sense of timelessness was also predominant in the story as a perfect utopian community remains unchanged, that is, it had no decline nor the need to improve.&lt;ref name=zh183/&gt; Eventually, the Chinese term ''Peach Blossom Spring'' (桃花源) came to be synonymous for the concept of utopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gu| first=Ming Dong| title=Chinese Theories of Fiction: A Non-Western Narrative System| year=2006| publisher=State University of New York Press| location=Albany| isbn=978-0-7914-6815-9| page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Datong====

[[Great Unity|Datong]] is a traditional Chinese Utopia.  The main description of it is found in the Chinese [[Classic of Rites]], in the chapter called "Li Yun" (禮運).  Later, Datong and its ideal of 'The World Belongs to Everyone/The World is Held in Common' 'Tianxia weigong/天下为公' 'influenced modern Chinese reformers and revolutionaries, such as [[Kang Youwei]].

====Schlaraffenland====

[[Schlaraffenland]] is an analogous German tradition.

All these myths also express some hope that the [[idyll]]ic state of affairs they describe is not irretrievably and irrevocably lost to mankind, that it can be regained in some way or other.

One way might be a quest for an "earthly paradise"—a place like [[Shangri-La]], hidden in the [[Tibet]]an mountains and described by [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]] in his utopian novel ''[[Lost Horizon (novel)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1933). [[Christopher Columbus]] followed directly in this tradition in his belief that he had found the Garden of Eden when, towards the end of the 15th century, he first encountered the [[New World]] and its indigenous inhabitants.

'''Visual thinking''', also called '''visual/spatial learning''' or '''picture thinking''' is the phenomenon of thinking through [[visual processing]].{{sfn|Deza|2009|p=526}}

Visual thinking has been described as seeing words as a series of pictures.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} It is common in approximately 60–65% of the general population.{{sfn|Deza|2009|p=526}}

"Real picture thinkers", those who use visual thinking almost to the exclusion of other kinds of thinking, make up a smaller percentage of the population. Research by child development theorist Linda Kreger Silverman suggests that less than 30% of the population strongly uses visual/spatial thinking, another 45% uses both visual/spatial thinking and thinking in the form of words, and 25% thinks exclusively in words. According to Kreger Silverman, of the 30% of the general population who use visual/spatial thinking, only a small percentage would use this style over and above all other forms of thinking, and can be said to be true "picture thinkers".{{sfn|Silverman|2005}}

==Research and theoretical background==
The Dutch [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|nonprofit organization]] the "Maria J. Krabbe Stichting Beelddenken" conducts research on "beelddenken". The "Maria J. Krabbe Stichting" has developed a test, named the "Ojemann wereldspel", to identify children who rely primarily on visual-spatial thinking. In this test, children are asked to build a village with toy houses and then replicate it a few days later. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boekinbeeld.be/beeldenken-signaleren.htm Signaleren van beelddenken bij kinderen met het ojemann wereldspel]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], there is a strong and growing interest in the phenomenon of 'true' "picture thinking", or "beelddenken".{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} As a result of increased media coverage during the last few years, there is an acceptance of its existence by the general public,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} despite criticism from Dutch psychologists and development theorists, principally N. van Woerden and R. Wiers.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Several websites and foundations are dedicated to "beelddenken".&lt;ref&gt;[http://beelddenken.startpagina.nl/ Startpagina "beelddenken"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stichtingbeelddenken.nl/ Stichting beelddenken ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-verbal thought==
{{See also|Cognitive psychology|Cognitive science|Nonverbal communication|}}
	
Thinking in mental images is one of a number of other recognized forms of non-verbal thought, such as [[Kinesthetic learning|kinesthetic]], musical and mathematical thinking.

===Linguistics===
{{Main|Linguistics}}

A common assumption is that people think in language, and that language and thought influence each other.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Linguistics]] studies how language is used and acquired.

The strong version of the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] in [[linguistics]] states that language determines thought, and that linguistic categories alone limit and determine cognitive categories. Although Whorf himself framed linguistic relativity in terms of "habits of mind" rather than determinism, the revolutionary nature of his hypothesis was met with much misinterpretation and criticism. In 1969, Brent Berlin and Paul Kay rejected the strong hypothesis using a [[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution|color terminology study]].{{sfn|Berlin|1969}}

[[Steven Pinker]] notes that we are not born with language, so that it is not likely that we are engineered to think in words alone.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, ''The Language Instinct''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple intelligences===
{{Main|Theory of multiple intelligences}}

Gardner's multiple intelligences theory recognises various forms of intelligence, namely spatial, linguistic, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denig|first=S. J.|date=2004|title=Multiple Intelligences and learning styles: Two complementary dimensions|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.614.828&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=Teachers College Record|volume=106|pages=96–111|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9620.2004.00322.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner's theory is discussed and cited in many of David A Sousa's 'How the Brain learns' series of books, including 'How the Gifted Brain learns' and 'How the Special Needs Brain Learns'.  Areas of competence may be reinforcing, but also mutually exclusive. In today's society the link between IQ and education has weakened, but the idea of educated and intelligent has become synonymous, interchangeable; reinforced by verbalizers being better able to internalize information, advocate systems and design jobs that monetarily reward strengths, a cycle that is self-perpetuating.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Split-brain research===
{{Main|Split-brain}}

According to [[Roger Sperry]] the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere perform different tasks. The left and right hemisphere may be simultaneously conscious in different, even mutually conflicting, mental experiences that run in parallel. The right [non-verbal] hemisphere perceives, thinks, remembers, reasons, wills and emotes, all at a characteristically human level.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Research which builds on Sperry's split brain research is reinforced by [[anecdotal evidence]], which supports the premise that different architectures lend themselves to one of the channels, at the expense of the others.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Spatial-temporal reasoning and spatial visualization ability===
{{Main|Spatial–temporal reasoning|Spatial visualization ability}}

Spatial-temporal reasoning is the ability to visualize special patterns and mentally manipulate them over a time-ordered sequence of spatial transformations.{{sfn|Deza|2009|p=526}} Spatial visualization ability is the ability to manipulate mentally two- and three-dimensional figures.{{sfn|Deza|2009|p=526}}

Spatial-temporal reasoning is prominent among visual thinkers as well as among [[Kinesthetic learning|kinesthetic learners]] (those who learn through movement, physical patterning and doing) and logical thinkers (mathematical thinkers who think in patterns and systems) who may not be strong visual thinkers at all.{{sfn|Deza|2009|p=526}}

===Photographic memory===
{{Main|Eidetic memory}}

[[Eidetic memory]] (photographic memory) may co-occur in visual thinkers as much as in any type of thinking style as it is a memory function associated with having vision rather than a thinking style.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Eidetic memory can still occur in those with visual [[agnosia]], who, unlike visual thinkers, may be limited in the use of visualization skills for mental reasoning.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Psychologist E.R Jaensch states that eidetic memory apart of visual thinking has to do with eidetic images fading between the line of the after image and the memory image.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} A fine relationship may exist between the after image and the memory image, which causes visual thinkers from not seeing the eidetic image but rather drawing upon perception and useful information.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Individuals diagnosed with agnosia, may not be able to perform mental reasoning.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Learning styles===
{{Main|Learning styles}}

The acknowledgement and application of different cognitive and [[learning styles]], including visual, kinesthetic, musical, mathematical and verbal thinking styles, are a common part of many current teacher training courses.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Those who think in pictures have generally claimed to be best at visual learning.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Empirical research shows that there is no evidence that identifying a student's "learning style" produces better outcomes. There is significant evidence that the widespread "meshing hypothesis", the assumption that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for the student's learning style, is invalid.{{sfn|Pashler|2008}}{{sfn|Felder|2007}} Well-designed studies "flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis".{{sfn|Pashler|2008}}

== Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) in teaching==
VTS allows teachers to teach reading with the use of complex visuals, rather than the print and individual text forms used in the past.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cappello|first=Marva|last2=Walker|first2=Nancy T.|date=2016-11-01|title=Visual Thinking Strategies: Teachers' Reflections on Closely Reading Complex Visual Texts Within the Disciplines|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/trtr.1523/abstract|journal=The Reading Teacher|language=en|volume=70|issue=3|pages=317–325|doi=10.1002/trtr.1523|issn=1936-2714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concurrency with dyslexia and autism==

===Dyslexia===
{{Main|Dyslexia}}

Research suggests that dyslexia is a symptom of a predominant visual/spatial learning.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan (1896), Hinselwood (1900), Orton (1925)&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan used the term 'word blindness,' in 1896. Hinselwood expanded on 'word blindness' to describe the reversing of letters and similar phenomena in the 1900s.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Orton suggested that individuals have difficulty associating the visual with the verbal form of words, in 1925.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Further studies, using technologies (PET and MRI), and wider and varied user groups in various languages, support the earlier findings.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Visual-spatial symptoms ([[dyslexia]], [[developmental coordination disorder]], [[Auditory processing disorder|auditory processing disorder (APD)]] and the like) arise in non-visual and non-spatial environments and situations; hence, visual/spatial learning is aggravated by an [[education system]] based upon information presented in [[written text]] instead of presented via [[multimedia]] and [[Hands-on learning|hands-on experience]].

===Autism===

Visual thinking has been argued by [[Temple Grandin]] to be an origin for delayed speech in people with [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandin.com/inc/visual.thinking.html THINKING IN PICTURES: Autism and Visual Thought&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that visual thinking has some necessary connection with autism.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Functional imaging studies on people with autism have supported the hypothesis that they have a cognitive style that favors the use of visuospatial coding strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sahyoun|first=Chérif P.|author2=John W.

==Art and design education==
Concepts related to visual thinking have played an important role in art and design education over the past several decades, but this has not always been the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpi.state.wi.us/standards/pdf/art&amp;design.pdf Wisconsin’s Model Academic Standards for Art and Design Education]&lt;/ref&gt; In Ancient Greece, Plato tended to place an emphasis on music to aid cognition in the education of heroes because of its mathematical tendencies and "harmonies of the cosmos". On the other hand, visual images, paintings in particular, caused the reliances on "illusionary images"&lt;ref name="Arnheim 1969"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnheim|first=Rudolf|title=Visual Thinking|year=1969|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520018710}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the Western world, children begin primary school with abstract thought and shapes, but as we grow older, according to Rudolf Arnheim, "arts are reduced to a desirable supplement"&lt;ref name="Arnheim 1969"/&gt; The general world trend in the late twentieth century caused an emphases towards scientific, mathematical, and quantitative approach to education, and art education is often refuted because it is based on perception. It is qualitative and subjective which makes it difficult to measure and evaluate.

However, fundamentals in visual thinking lay the ground work for many design disciplines such as art and architecture. Two of the most influential aspects of visual composition in these disciplines are patterns and color. Patterns are not only prevalent in many different aspects of everyday life, but it is also telling about our interpretation of the world. In addition, there are now studied approaches to how color should be used in design where "the functional aesthetics of colour can be reduced to a small number of guidelines and lists the main properties needed to make design decisions leading to visual clarity".&lt;ref name= Ware&gt;{{cite book|last=Ware|first=Colin|title=Visual thinking for design|year=2008|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|location=Burlington, Mass.|isbn=978-0123708960|edition=[Repr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, techniques in art and design can open up pathways to stimulate the thought process and problem solving. Sketches offer an unrestrained way to get thoughts down on paper through the "abstract representations of ideas and idea structures".&lt;ref name= Ware/&gt;  In this way, sketching not only helps to generate ideas, but also to reflect and edit them as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tovey, M.|first=Porter, S.|last2=Newman, R.|date=March 2003|title=Sketching, concept development and automotive design|url=|journal=Design Studies|volume=24 |issue=2|pages=135–153|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an effective means of communication, especially for architects and engineers, for translating ideas from designer to client. Despite all the advantages of integrating art and visuals into education, it is a difficult skill to master. Those who can are well versed in visual analysis. It takes a lot of practice to have sketches evolve from "meaningless scribbles" to a complex "thinking tool".&lt;ref name= Ware/&gt;

The '''war on drugs''' is a campaign, led by the [[U.S. federal government]], of [[prohibition of drugs|drug prohibition]], [[military aid]], and [[military intervention]], with the stated aim being to reduce the [[illegal drug trade]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/03/27/472023148/legalize-all-drugs-the-risks-are-tremendous-without-defining-the-problem|title=Legalize All Drugs?

The term was popularized by the media shortly after a press conference given on June 18, 1971, by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]—the day after publication of a special message from President Nixon to the Congress on Drug Abuse Prevention and Control—during which he declared drug abuse "public enemy number one". That message to the Congress included text about devoting more federal resources to the "prevention of new addicts, and the rehabilitation of those who are addicted", but that part did not receive the same public attention as the term "war on drugs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3048|title=Richard Nixon: Special Message to the Congress on Drug Abuse Prevention and Control|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nixon Calls War on Drugs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nixon Calls War on Drugs|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-5IjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RLcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=973,31915&amp;dq=nixon+war+on+drugs&amp;hl=en|accessdate=October 13, 2012|newspaper=The Palm Beach Post|date=June 18, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dufton|first=Emily|title=The War on Drugs: How President Nixon Tied Addiction to Crime|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/03/the-war-on-drugs-how-president-nixon-tied-addiction-to-crime/254319/|accessdate=October 13, 2012|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two years prior to this, Nixon had formally declared a "war on drugs" that would be directed toward eradication, interdiction, and incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;Payan, Tony (2013).

On May 13, 2009, [[Gil Kerlikowske]]—the Director of the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] (ONDCP)—signaled that the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] did not plan to significantly alter drug enforcement policy, but also that the administration would not use the term "War on Drugs", because Kerlikowske considers the term to be "counter-productive".&lt;ref name="WSJCZAR"&gt;{{Cite news|title=White House Czar Calls for End to 'War on Drugs' |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124225891527617397|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 14, 2009|accessdate=May 14, 2009 | first=Gary | last=Fields}}&lt;/ref&gt; ONDCP's view is that "drug addiction is a disease that can be successfully prevented and treated... making drugs more available will make it harder to keep our communities healthy and safe".&lt;ref name="dup2"/&gt; One of the alternatives that Kerlikowske has showcased is the [[drug policy of Sweden]], which seeks to balance public health concerns with opposition to [[drug legalization]]. The prevalence rates for [[cocaine]] use in Sweden are barely one-fifth of those in Spain, the biggest consumer of the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thelocal.se/20140410/swedens-strict-anti-drug-laws | title=Sweden's tough drug laws leave addicts behind | website=[[The Local]] | date=April 10, 2014 | accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the [[Global Commission on Drug Policy]] released a critical report on the War on Drugs, declaring: "The global war on drugs has failed, with devastating consequences for individuals and societies around the world.

{{Main|History of United States drug prohibition}}
{{See also|Legal history of cannabis in the United States}}

=== 20th century ===
The first U.S. law that restricted the distribution and use of certain drugs was the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914. The first local laws came as early as 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/heroin/etc/history.html |title=Opium Throughout History |publisher=PBS Frontline |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, the United States passed the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]], prohibiting the sale, manufacture, and transportation of [[ethanol|alcohol]], with exceptions for religious and medical use. In 1920, the United States passed the [[National Prohibition Act]] (Volstead Act), enacted to carry out the provisions in law of the 18th Amendment.

The [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]] was established in the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] by an act of June 14, 1930 (46 Stat. 585).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/170.html#170.3 |title=Records of the Drug Enforcement Administration DEA |publisher=Archives.gov |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, [[Prohibition in the United States|the federal prohibition for alcohol]] was repealed by passage of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]]. In 1935, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] publicly supported the adoption of the [[Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' used the headline "Roosevelt Asks Narcotic War Aid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.net/schaffer/History/e1930/rooseveltasks.htm |title=ROOSEVELT ASKS NARCOTIC WAR AID, 1935 |publisher=Druglibrary.net |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15024 |title=Letter to the World Narcotic Defense Association.

In 1937, the [[Marihuana Tax Act of 1937]] was passed. Several scholars have claimed that the goal was to destroy the hemp industry,&lt;ref name="nafta-neocolonialism-129"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=French|first1=Laurence|first2=Magdaleno|last2=Manzanárez|title=NAFTA &amp; neocolonialism: comparative criminal, human &amp; social justice|publisher=University Press of America|year=2004|page=129|isbn=978-0-7618-2890-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4ozF1Yg-c4MC&amp;pg=PA129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Earlywine, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=r9wPbxMAG8cC&amp;pg=PA24 p. 24]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="under-influence-55"&gt;Peet, 2004: [https://books.google.com/?id=uC0_YznYjScC&amp;pg=PA55 p. 55]&lt;/ref&gt; largely as an effort of businessmen [[Andrew Mellon]], [[Randolph Hearst]], and the [[Du Pont family]].&lt;ref name="nafta-neocolonialism-129" /&gt;&lt;ref name="under-influence-55" /&gt; These scholars argue that with the invention of the [[decorticator]], hemp became a very cheap substitute for the [[paper pulp]] that was used in the newspaper industry.&lt;ref name="nafta-neocolonialism-129" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bound in twine: the history and ecology of the henequen-wheat complex for Mexico and the American and Canadian Plains, 1880–1950|author=Sterling Evans|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-58544-596-7|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_wFkZgyuGFAC&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars believe that Hearst felt{{dubious|date=March 2015}} that this was a threat to his extensive timber holdings.

On October 27, 1970, Congress passed the [[Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970]], which, among other things, categorized controlled substances based on their medicinal use and potential for addiction.&lt;ref name="frontline" /&gt; In 1971, two congressmen released an explosive report on the growing heroin epidemic among U.S. servicemen in Vietnam; ten to fifteen percent of the servicemen were addicted to heroin, and President Nixon declared drug abuse to be "public enemy number one".&lt;ref name="frontline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dupoint"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/interviews/dupont.html WGBH educational foundation.

{{quote|The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs?

In 1973, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] was created to replace the [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]].&lt;ref name="frontline" /&gt;

The Nixon Administration also repealed the federal 2–10-year [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum sentences]] for  possession of marijuana and started federal demand reduction programs and drug-treatment programs. [[Robert DuPont]], the "Drug czar" in the Nixon Administration, stated it would be more accurate to say that Nixon ended, rather than launched, the "war on drugs". DuPont also argued that it was the proponents of drug legalization that popularized the term "war on drugs".&lt;ref name="dup2"/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2014}}

=== 21st century ===
The [[Global Commission on Drug Policy]] released a report on June 2, 2011, alleging that "The War On Drugs Has Failed." The commissioned was made up of 22 self-appointed members including a number of prominent international politicians and writers. U.S. Surgeon General [[Regina Benjamin]] also released the first ever National Prevention Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthcare.gov/center/councils/nphpphc/strategy/index.html National Prevention Strategy, June 16, 2011].

On May 21, 2012, the U.S. Government published an updated version of its Drug Policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/policy-and-research/principles-of-modern-drug-policy Principles of Modern Drug Policy]. Whitehouse.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; The director of [[ONDCP]] stated simultaneously that this policy is something different from the "War on Drugs":
* The U.S. Government sees the policy as a "third way" approach to drug control; an approach that is based on the results of a huge investment in research from some of the world's preeminent scholars on disease of substance abuse.
* The policy does not see drug legalization as the "silver bullet" solution to drug control.
* It is not a policy where success is measured by the number of arrests made or prisons built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/news-releases-remarks/principles-of-modern-drug-policy-directors-remarks-at-the-world-federation-against-drugs Statement of the Government of the United States of America World Federation Against Drugs 3rd World Forum, May 21, 2012, Stockholm, Sweden]. Whitehouse.gov (September 21, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same meeting was a declaration signed by the representatives of Italy, the Russian Federation, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States in line with this:
"Our approach must be a balanced one, combining effective enforcement to restrict the supply of drugs, with efforts to reduce demand and build recovery; supporting people to live a life free of addiction."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfad.se/images/articles/Final_statement_WFAD.pdf Joint statement For a humane and balanced drug policy, Stockholm 20 May 2012].

In March 2016 the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] stated that the International Drug Control treaties do not mandate a "war on drugs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/en/pressrels/2016/unisnar1264.html INCB Report 2015 – Press material] United Nations Information Service 2.3.2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US incarceration rate timeline.gif|thumb|upright=1.3|Graph demonstrating increases in [[United States incarceration rate]]]]

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the War on Drugs caused soaring arrest rates that [[Race and the War on Drugs#African American Communities|disproportionately targeted African Americans]] due to various factors.&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2000/usa/Rcedrg00-05.htm |title=The Impact of the War on Drugs on U.S. Incarceration |date=May 2000 |accessdate = June 10, 2007 |publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Ehrlichman]], an aide to Nixon, said that Nixon used the war on drugs to criminalize and disrupt black and hippie communities and their leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/3/22/11278760/war-on-drugs-racism-nixon|title=Nixon official: real reason for the drug war was to criminalize black people and hippies|author=German Lopez|date=March 23, 2016|website=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present state of incarceration in the U.S. as a result of the war on drugs arrived in several stages. By 1971, different stops on drugs had been implemented for more than 50 years (for e.g. since 1914, 1937 etc.) with only a very small increase of inmates per 100,000 citizens.
During the first 9 years after Nixon coined the expression "War on Drugs", statistics showed only a minor increase in the total number of imprisoned.

After 1980, the situation began to change. In the 1980s, while the number of arrests for all crimes had risen by 28%, the number of arrests for drug offenses rose 126%.&lt;ref&gt;Austin J, McVey AD. The 1989 NCCD prison population forecast: the impact of the war on drugs. San Francisco: National Council on Crime and Delinquency, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The result of increased demand was the development of privatization and the [[Incarceration in the United States#Privatization|for-profit prison industry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Private prison#Development 3|Development of private prisons in the United States]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US Department of Justice]], reporting on the effects of state initiatives, has stated that, from 1990 through 2000, "the increasing number of drug offenses accounted for 27% of the total growth among black inmates, 7% of the total growth among Hispanic inmates, and 15% of the growth among white inmates." In addition to prison or jail, the United States provides for the deportation of many non-citizens convicted of drug offenses.&lt;ref&gt;[Gabriel J.

In 1994, the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' reported that the "War on Drugs" resulted in the incarceration of one million Americans each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Lester Grinspoon]], M.D.&amp; James B.

===Sentencing disparities===
In 1986, the U.S. Congress passed laws that created a 100 to 1 sentencing disparity for the trafficking ''or possession'' of [[crack cocaine|crack]] when compared to penalties for ''trafficking'' of [[cocaine|powder cocaine]],&lt;ref name="wa-post-dispar-2010"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Congress passes bill to reduce disparity in crack, powder cocaine sentencing|author=Jim Abrams|work=Washington Post|date=July 29, 2010|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/28/AR2010072802969.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="celling-america-246-247"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gates-of-injustice" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = United States Sentencing Commission | title = Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy | year = 2002 | page = 6 | url = http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/02crack/2002crackrpt.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070715212213/http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/02crack/2002crackrpt.pdf | archivedate = July 15, 2007 | accessdate=August 24, 2010 | quote = As a result of the 1986 Act ... penalties for a first-time cocaine trafficking offense: 5 grams or more of crack cocaine = five-year mandatory minimum penalty}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been widely criticized as discriminatory against minorities, mostly blacks, who were more likely to use crack than powder cocaine.&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/02/AR2010080204360.html "The Fair Sentencing Act corrects a long-time wrong in cocaine cases"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 3, 2010.

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], crime statistics show that—in the United States in 1999—compared to non-minorities, African Americans were far more likely to be arrested for drug crimes, and received much stiffer penalties and sentences.&lt;ref name="hrw-race-summary-recommendations"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2000/usa/Rcedrg00.htm#P54_1086|title=I.

Statistics from 1998 show that there were [[Race and the War on Drugs|wide racial disparities in arrests, prosecutions, sentencing and deaths]]. African-American drug users made up for 35% of drug arrests, 55% of convictions, and 74% of people sent to prison for drug possession crimes.&lt;ref name="celling-america-246-247"&gt;Burton-Rose (ed.), 1998: pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide African-Americans were sent to state prisons for drug offenses 13 times more often than other races,&lt;ref name="hrw-race-key-findings"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/drugs/war/key-facts.htm|title=Key Findings at a Glance|website=Racial Disparities in the War on Drugs|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=February 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though they only supposedly comprised 13% of regular drug users.&lt;ref name="celling-america-246-247" /&gt;
[[File:Marion Barry smoking crack.gif|thumb|right|D.C. Mayor [[Marion Barry]] captured on a surveillance camera smoking crack cocaine during a sting operation by the [[FBI]] and [[D.C. Police]].]]
Anti-drug legislation over time has also displayed an apparent racial bias. University of Minnesota Professor and social justice author [[Michael Tonry]] writes, "The War on Drugs foreseeably and unnecessarily blighted the lives of hundreds and thousands of young disadvantaged black Americans and undermined decades of effort to improve the life chances of members of the urban black underclass."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tonry, Malign Neglect – Race Crime and Punishment in America (London: Oxford University Press, 1995), 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] decided that the government needed to make an effort to curtail the social unrest that blanketed the country at the time. He decided to focus his efforts on illegal drug use, an approach which was in line with expert opinion on the subject at the time. In the 1960s, it was believed that at least half of the crime in the U.S. was drug related, and this number grew as high as 90 percent in the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;James Inciardi, ''The War on Drugs'' IV, ed. 4. (Delaware: Pearson Allyn and Bacon, 2008), 286.&lt;/ref&gt; He created the Reorganization Plan of 1968 which merged the Bureau of Narcotics and the Bureau of Drug Abuse to form the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs within the Department of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew B. Whitford and Jeffrey Yates, ''Presidential Rhetoric and the Public Agenda'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009), 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The belief during this time about drug use was summarized by journalist [[Max Lerner]] in his work ''America as a Civilization'' (1957):

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a case in point we may take the known fact of the prevalence of reefer and dope addiction in Negro areas. This is essentially explained in terms of poverty, slum living, and broken families, yet it would be easy to show the lack of drug addiction among other ethnic groups where the same conditions apply.&lt;ref&gt;Inciardi. ''The War on Drugs IV'', 248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Richard Nixon]] became president in 1969, and did not back away from the anti-drug precedent set by Johnson. Nixon began orchestrating drug raids nationwide to improve his "watchdog" reputation. Lois B. Defleur, a social historian who studied drug arrests during this period in Chicago, stated that, "police administrators indicated they were making the kind of arrests the public wanted". Additionally, some of Nixon's newly created drug enforcement agencies would resort to illegal practices to make arrests as they tried to meet public demand for arrest numbers. From 1972 to 1973, the Office of Drug Abuse and Law Enforcement performed 6,000 drug arrests in 18 months, the majority of the arrested black.&lt;ref&gt;Whitford and Yates. ''Presidential Rhetoric and the Public Agenda'' 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The next two Presidents, [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Jimmy Carter]], responded with programs that were essentially a continuation of their predecessors. Shortly after [[Ronald Reagan]] became President in 1981 he delivered a speech on the topic. Reagan announced, "We're taking down the surrender flag that has flown over so many drug efforts; we're running up a battle flag."&lt;ref&gt;Whitford and Yates. ''Presidential Rhetoric and the Public Agenda'', 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, driven by the 1986 cocaine overdose of black basketball star [[Len Bias]],{{dubious|date=February 2014}} Reagan was able to pass the [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986|Anti-Drug Abuse Act]] through Congress. This legislation appropriated an additional $1.7 billion to fund the War on Drugs. More importantly, it established 29 new, mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses. In the entire history of the country up until that point, the legal system had only seen 55 minimum sentences in total.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Ventura. ''American Conspiracies'' (New York: Skyshore Publishing, 2010), 117.&lt;/ref&gt; A major stipulation of the new sentencing rules included different mandatory minimums for powder and crack cocaine. At the time of the bill, there was public debate as to the difference in potency and effect of powder cocaine, generally used by whites, and crack cocaine, generally used by blacks, with many believing that "crack" was substantially more powerful and addictive. Crack and powder cocaine are closely related chemicals, crack being a smokeable, [[Free base|freebase]] form of powdered cocaine hydrochloride which produces a shorter, more intense high while using less of the drug. This method is more cost effective, and therefore more prevalent on the inner-city streets, while powder cocaine remains more popular in white suburbia. The Reagan administration began shoring public opinion against "crack", encouraging DEA official Robert Putnam to play up the harmful effects of the drug. Stories of "crack whores" and "crack babies" became commonplace; by 1986, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' had declared "crack" the issue of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Alexander. ''[[The New Jim Crow]]: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness''. (New York: The New Press, 2010), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Riding the wave of public fervor, Reagan established much harsher sentencing for crack cocaine, handing down stiffer felony penalties for much smaller amounts of the drug.&lt;ref&gt;Whitford and Yates. ''Presidential Rhetoric and the Public Agenda'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan protégé and former Vice-President George H. W. Bush was next to occupy the oval office, and the drug policy under his watch held true to his political background. Bush maintained the hard line drawn by his predecessor and former boss, increasing narcotics regulation when the First National Drug Control Strategy was issued by the Office of National Drug Control in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Tonry. ''Malign Neglect – Race, Crime and Punishment in America'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next three presidents – Clinton, Bush and Obama – continued this trend, maintaining the War on Drugs as they inherited it upon taking office.&lt;ref&gt;Whitford and Yates. Presidential Rhetoric and the Public Agenda. 72&lt;/ref&gt; During this time of passivity by the federal government, it was the states that initiated controversial legislation in the War on Drugs. Racial bias manifested itself in the states through such controversial policies as the "stop and frisk" police practices in New York city and the "three strikes" felony laws began in California in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Alexander. ''The New Jim Crow – Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness'', 92&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, President Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act into law that dramatically reduced the 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine, which disproportionately affected minorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN01789:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp; Bill Summary &amp; Status – 111th Congress (2009–2010) – S.1789 – All Information – THOMAS (Library of Congress)]. Thomas.loc.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commonly used illegal drugs==
Commonly used illegal drugs include [[heroin]], [[cocaine]], [[methamphetamine]], and, [[marijuana]].

Heroin is an [[opiate]] that is highly addictive. If caught selling or possessing heroin, a perpetrator can be charged with a [[felony]] and face two–four years in prison and could be fined to a maximum of $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Possession of Heroin|url=http://www.criminalattorney.com/heroin/possession/|website=Criminal Attorney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crystal meth]] is composed of methamphetamine hydrochloride. It is marketed as either a white powder or in a solid (rock) form. The possession of crystal meth can result in a punishment varying from a fine to a jail sentence. As with other drug crimes, sentencing length may increase depending on the amount of the drug found in the possession of the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Possession of Crystal Meth|url=http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/crystal-meth-possession.htm|website=The Criminal Defense Lawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cocaine possession is illegal across the U.S., with the cheaper [[crack cocaine]] incurring even greater penalties. Having possession is when the accused knowingly has it on their person, or in a backpack or purse. The possession of cocaine with no prior conviction, for the first offense, the person will be sentenced to a maximum of one year in prison or fined $1,000, or both. If the person has a prior conviction, whether it is a [[narcotic]] or cocaine, they will be sentenced to two years in prison, a $2,500 fine, or both. With two or more convictions of possession prior to this present offense, they can be sentenced to 90 days in prison along with a $5,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cocaine Possession|url=http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/crime-penalties/cocaine-possession.htm|website=The Criminal Defense Lawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marijuana is the most popular illegal drug worldwide. The punishment for possession of it is less than for the possession of cocaine or heroin. In some U.S. states, the drug is legal. Over 80 million Americans have tried marijuana. The ''Criminal Defense Lawyer'' article claims that, depending on the age of person and how much the person has been caught for possession, they will be fined and could plea bargain into going to a treatment program versus going to prison. In each state the convictions differ along with how much marijuana they have on their person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marijuana Possession|url=http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/crime-penalties/federal/Marijuana-Possession.htm|website=The Criminal Defense Lawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States foreign policy and covert military activities==
Some scholars have claimed that the phrase "War on Drugs" is propaganda cloaking an extension of earlier military or paramilitary operations.&lt;ref name="Bullington 1990 39–55"/&gt; Others have argued that large amounts of "[[war as metaphor|drug war]]" foreign aid money, training, and equipment actually goes to fighting leftist insurgencies and is often provided to groups who themselves are involved in large-scale narco-trafficking, such as corrupt members of the Colombian military.&lt;ref name="whiteout-chapter-14"/&gt;

===War in Vietnam===
From 1963 to the end of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1975, marijuana usage became common among U.S. soldiers in non-combat situations. Some servicemen also used heroin. Many of the servicemen ended the heroin use after returning to the United States but came home addicted. In 1971, the U.S. military conducted a study of drug use among American servicemen and women. It found that daily usage rates for drugs on a worldwide basis were as low as two percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Alan|title=Preliminary Findings from the 1971 DoD Survey of drug Use|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0743852|publisher=Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the spring of 1971, two congressmen released an alarming report alleging that 15% of the servicemen in Vietnam were addicted to heroin. Marijuana use was also common in Vietnam. Soldiers who used drugs had more disciplinary problems. The frequent drug use had become an issue for the commanders in Vietnam; in 1971 it was estimated that 30,000 servicemen were addicted to drugs, most of them to [[heroin]].&lt;ref name="Nixon Calls War on Drugs"/&gt;

From 1971 on, therefore, returning servicemen were required to take a mandatory heroin test. Servicemen who tested positive upon returning from Vietnam were not allowed to return home until they had passed the test with a negative result. The program also offered a treatment for heroin addicts.&lt;ref name="vander"&gt;Peter Brush: [http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/Brush/American-drug-use-vietnam.htm#_ednref20 HIGHER AND HIGHER: AMERICAN DRUG USE IN VIETNAM], ''Vietnam magazine'', Vol.15, No. 4, December 2002 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103439/http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/Brush/American-drug-use-vietnam.htm#_ednref20 |date=June 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Intercept===
One of the first anti-drug efforts in the realm of foreign policy was President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]'s [[Operation Intercept]], announced in September 1969, targeted at reducing the amount of cannabis entering the United States from Mexico. The effort began with an intense inspection crackdown that resulted in an almost shutdown of cross-border traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB86/|title=Operation Intercept: The perils of unilateralism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the burden on border crossings was controversial in border states, the effort only lasted twenty days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/library/studies/cu/CU59.html |title=Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs |publisher=Druglibrary.org |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Just Cause===
{{Main|Operation Just Cause|Operation Nifty Package}}
[[File:Panama clashes 1989.JPEG|thumb|right|The U.S. military invasion of Panama in 1989]]
On December 20, 1989, the United States invaded Panama as part of [[Operation Just Cause]], which involved 25,000 American troops. Gen. [[Manuel Noriega]], head of the government of Panama, had been giving military assistance to [[Contras|Contra groups]] in Nicaragua at the request of the U.S. which, in exchange, tolerated his drug trafficking activities, which they had known about since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="whiteout-noriega" /&gt;&lt;ref name="panama-buckley"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Buckley|first=Kevin|title=Panama: The Whole Story|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1991|isbn=978-0-671-72794-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) tried to indict Noriega in 1971, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] prevented them from doing so.&lt;ref name="whiteout-noriega"&gt;Cockburn and St. Clair, 1998: pp. 287–290&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA, which was then directed by future president [[George H. W. Bush]], provided Noriega with hundreds of thousands of dollars per year as payment for his work in Latin America.&lt;ref name="whiteout-noriega"/&gt; When CIA pilot [[Eugene Hasenfus]] was shot down over Nicaragua by the [[Sandinistas]], documents aboard the plane revealed many of the CIA's activities in Latin America, and the CIA's connections with Noriega became a [[public relations]] "liability" for the U.S. government, which finally allowed the DEA to indict him for drug trafficking, after decades of tolerating his drug operations.&lt;ref name="whiteout-noriega" /&gt; Operation Just Cause, whose purpose was to capture Noriega and overthrow his government; Noriega found temporary asylum in the [[Papal Nuncio]], and surrendered to U.S. soldiers on January 3, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Baker |first=Russell|title= OBSERVER; Is This Justice Necessary?|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DF123FF930A35752C0A966958260|date=January 3, 1990|work=The New York Times Company|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced by a court in Miami to 45 years in prison.&lt;ref name="whiteout-noriega" /&gt;

===Plan Colombia===
{{Main|Plan Colombia|Paramilitarism in Colombia}}
{{US involvement in Colombia}}

As part of its [[Plan Colombia]] program, the United States government currently provides hundreds of millions of dollars per year of [[military aid]], training, and equipment to Colombia,&lt;ref name="house-colombia-appropriations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Fappropriations.house.gov/pdf/FY10_SFOPS_Conference_Summary.pdf|title=SUMMARY: FY 2010 STATE AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS|year=2010|website=U.S. House of Representatives|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to fight left-wing guerrillas such as the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC-EP), which has been accused of being involved in drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;Weiser, Benjamin.

Private U.S. corporations have signed contracts to carry out anti-drug activities as part of Plan Colombia. [[DynCorp]], the largest private company involved, was among those contracted by the State Department, while others signed contracts with the Defense Department.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.colectivodeabogados.org/article.php3?id_article=1253 Private Security Transnational Enterprises in Colombia]'' [[José Alvear Restrepo Lawyers' Collective]] February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombian military personnel have received extensive [[counterinsurgency]] training from U.S. military and law enforcement agencies, including the [[School of Americas]] (SOA). Author Grace Livingstone has stated that more Colombian SOA graduates have been implicated in human rights abuses than currently known SOA graduates from any other country. All of the commanders of the brigades highlighted in a 2001 [[Human Rights Watch]] report on Colombia were graduates of the SOA, including the III brigade in [[Valle del Cauca]], where the 2001 [[Paramilitarism in Colombia#The Alto Naya massacre|Alto Naya Massacre]] occurred. US-trained officers have been accused of being directly or indirectly involved in many atrocities during the 1990s, including the [[Massacre of Trujillo]] and the 1997 [[Mapiripán Massacre]].

In 2000, the Clinton administration initially waived all but one of the human rights conditions attached to Plan Colombia, considering such aid as crucial to national security at the time.&lt;ref name="doug"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stokes |first=Doug |title=America's Other War: Terrorizing Colombia |url=http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/54324.html |publisher=Zed Books |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-84277-547-9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109132325/http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/54324.html |archivedate=January 9, 2016 |df=mdy-all }} p.&amp;nbsp;99&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts of U.S. and Colombian governments have been criticized for focusing on fighting leftist guerrillas in southern regions without applying enough pressure on right-wing paramilitaries and continuing drug smuggling operations in the north of the country.&lt;ref name="soa-gill-180"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gill|first=Leslie|title=The School of the Americas: military training and political violence in the Americas|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-8223-3392-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IqPqwx0SXfMC&amp;pg=PA180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="under-influence-61"&gt;Peet, 2004: [https://books.google.com/?id=uC0_YznYjScC&amp;pg=PA61 p. 61]&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch, congressional committees and other entities have documented the existence of connections between members of the Colombian military and the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]], which the U.S. government has listed as a terrorist group, and that Colombian military personnel have committed human rights abuses which would make them ineligible for U.S. aid under current laws.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 2010, the [[Washington Office on Latin America]] concluded that both Plan Colombia and the Colombian government's security strategy "came at a high cost in lives and resources, only did part of the job, are yielding diminishing returns and have left important institutions weaker."&lt;ref&gt;Washington Office on Latin America [http://www.wola.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=viewp&amp;id=1134&amp;Itemid=2 "Columbia: Don't Call it a Model"], July 13, 2010 Retrieved on May 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 report by the [[RAND Corporation]], which was issued to analyze viable strategies for the Mexican drug war considering successes experienced in Columbia, noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Between 1999 and 2002, the United States gave Colombia $2.04 billion in aid, 81 percent of which was for military purposes, placing Colombia just below Israel and Egypt among the largest recipients of U.S. military assistance. Colombia increased its defense spending from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2000 to 4.19 percent in 2005. Overall, the results were extremely positive. Greater spending on infrastructure and social programs helped the Colombian government increase its political legitimacy, while improved security forces were better able to consolidate control over large swaths of the country previously overrun by insurgents and drug cartels.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also notes that, "Plan Colombia has been widely hailed as a success, and some analysts believe that, by 2010, Colombian security forces had finally gained the upper hand once and for all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico Is Not Colombia|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR500/RR548z2/RAND_RR548z2.pdf|website=rand.org|publisher=RAND Corporation National Security Research Division|accessdate=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MilitaresMichoacán.jpg|thumb|Mexico is scheduled to receive US$1.6 billion in equipment and strategic support from the United States through the [[Mérida Initiative]]]]

===Mérida Initiative===
The [[Mérida Initiative]] is a security cooperation between the United States and the government of Mexico and the countries of [[Central America]]. It was approved on June 30, 2008, and its stated aim is combating the threats of drug trafficking and transnational crime. The Mérida Initiative appropriated $1.4 billion in a three-year commitment (2008–2010) to the Mexican government for military and law enforcement training and equipment, as well as technical advice and training to strengthen the national justice systems. The Mérida Initiative targeted many very important government officials, but it failed to address the thousands of Central Americans who had to flee their countries due to the danger they faced everyday because of the war on drugs. There is still not any type of plan that addresses these people. No weapons are included in the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/news/defence/business/jdw/jdw071211_1_n.shtml |title=Mexico's 2008 defence budget goes under review |publisher=Janes.com |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0508/10180.html |title=Bush pushes Mexico money in Iraq bill |publisher=Politico.com |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerial herbicide application===
{{Main|Plan Colombia#Fumigation strategy and criticisms}}
The United States regularly sponsors the spraying of large amounts of [[herbicide]]s such as [[glyphosate]] over the jungles of Central and South America as part of its drug eradication programs. Environmental consequences resulting from aerial fumigation have been criticized as detrimental to some of the world's most fragile ecosystems;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rebecca Bowe | title = The drug war on the Amazon | journal = E: The Environmental Magazine | issue = Nov–Dec | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same aerial fumigation practices are further credited with causing health problems in local populations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news | author = Larry Rohter | title = To Colombians, Drug War is a Toxic Foe | publisher = The New York Times | date = May 1, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. operations in Honduras===
In 2012, the U.S. sent DEA agents to Honduras to assist security forces in counternarcotics operations. Honduras has been a major stop for drug traffickers, who use small planes and landing strips hidden throughout the country to transport drugs. The U.S. government made agreements with several Latin American countries to share intelligence and resources to counter the drug trade. DEA agents, working with other U.S. agencies such as the State Department, the CBP, and Joint Task Force-Bravo, assisted Honduras troops in conducting raids on traffickers' sites of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A New Front Line in the U.S. Drug War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/americas/honduran-drug-raid-deaths-wont-alter-us-policy.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=October 13, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ONDCP Pothead.gif|thumb|An American domestic government propaganda poster circa 2000 concerning [[cannabis in the United States]].]]

The War on Drugs has been a highly contentious issue since its inception. A poll on October 2, 2008, found that three in four Americans believed that the War On Drugs was failing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zogby.com/news/readnews.cfm?ID=1568 |title=Public Views Clash with U.S. Policy on Cuba, Immigration, and Drugs |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |date=October 2, 2008 |publisher=Zogby International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211052209/http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.cfm?ID=1568 |archivedate=February 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a Pew Research Center poll found more than six in ten Americans state that state governments moving away from mandatory prison terms for drug law violations is a good thing. while three out of ten Americans say these policy changes are a bad thing. This a substantial shift from the same poll questions since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/january_2018/voters_have_little_faith_in_war_on_druSince|title=Voters Have Little Faith in War on Drugs|last=|first=|date=January 10, 2018|website=Rasmussen Reports|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 a Pew Research Center poll found that 67 percent of Americans feel that a movement towards treatment for drugs like cocaine and heroin is better versus the 26 percent who feel that prosecution is the better route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.people-press.org/2014/04/02/americas-new-drug-policy-landscape/|title=America’s New Drug Policy Landscape {{!}} Pew Research Center|date=2014-04-02|work=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Rasmussen Report poll found that less than 10 percent of Americans think that the War on Drugs is being won and that 75 percent found that Americans believe that America is not winning the War on Drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/press-release/2014/04/new-pew-poll-confirms-americans-ready-end-war-drugs|title=New Pew Poll Confirms Americans Ready to End War on Drugs|website=Drug Policy Alliance|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican citizens, unlike American citizens, support the current measures their government were taking against drug cartels in the War on Drugs. A Pew Research Center poll in 2010 found that 80 percent supported the current use of the army in the War on Drugs to combat drug traffickers with about 55 percent saying that they have been making progress in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/08/12/mexicans-continue-support-for-drug-war/|title=Mexicans Continue Support for Drug War {{!}} Pew Research Center|date=2010-08-12|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later in 2011 a Pew Research Center poll uncovered that 71 percent of Mexicans find that "illegal drugs are a very big problem in their country". 77 percent of Mexicans also found that drug cartels and the violence associated with them are as well a big challenge for Mexico. The poll also found that the percentages believing that that illegal drugs and violence related to the cartel where Higher in the North with 87 percent for illegal drug use and 94 percent cartel related violence being a problem. This compared to the other locations: South, Mexico City and the greater area of Mexico City, and Central Mexico which are all about 18 percent or lower than the North on Illegal drug use being a problem for the country. These perspective areas are also lower than the North by 19 percent or more on the issue of drug cartel related violence being an issue for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/08/31/crime-and-drug-cartels-top-concerns-in-mexico/|title=Crime and Drug Cartels Top Concerns in Mexico|date=2011-08-31|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a Pew Research Center poll found that 74 percent of Mexican citizens would support the training of their police and military, the poll also found that another 55 percent would support the supplying of weapons and financial aid. Though the poll indicates a support of U.S. aid, 59 percent were against troops on the ground by the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/16/mexican-public-favors-military-use-u-s-aid-to-fight-drug-cartels/|title=Mexican public favors military use, U.S. aid to fight drug cartels {{!}} Pew Research Center|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013 Pew Research Center found in a poll that 56 percent of Mexican citizens believe that the United States and Mexico are both to blame for drug violence in Mexico. In that same poll 20 percent believe that the United States is solely to blame and 17 percent believe that Mexico is solely to blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/04/29/u-s-image-rebounds-in-mexico/|title=U.S. Image Rebounds in Mexico|date=2013-04-29|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting in Guatemala in 2012, three former presidents from Guatemala, Mexico and Colombia said that the war on drugs had failed and that they would propose a discussion on alternatives, including decriminalization, at the [[Summit of the Americas]] in April of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.economist.com/node/21551550 |title= Politics this week |date= March 31, 2012 |journal= The Economist |accessdate=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guatemalan President [[Otto Pérez Molina]] said that the war on drugs was exacting too high a price on the lives of Central Americans and that it was time to "end the [[taboo]] on discussing decriminalization".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-17502417 BBC News – Guatemala's president urges debate on drug legalisation]. Bbc.co.uk (March 25, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; At the summit, the government of Colombia pushed for the most far-reaching change to drugs policy since the war on narcotics was declared by Nixon four decades prior, citing the catastrophic effects it had had in Colombia.&lt;ref name = "EdVu 15Apr2012"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/15/colombia-global-drugs-taskforce |title= Colombia calls for global drugs taskforce |author= Ed Vulliamy |date= April 15, 2012 |newspaper= The Observer |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several critics have compared the wholesale incarceration of the dissenting minority of drug users to the wholesale incarceration of other minorities in history. Psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]], for example, wrote in 1997 "Over the past thirty years, we have replaced the medical-political persecution of illegal sex users ('perverts' and 'psychopaths') with the even more ferocious medical-political persecution of illegal drug users."&lt;ref&gt;''The Manufacture of Madness: A Comparative Study of the Inquisition and the Mental Health Movement'' (1997), p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-economic effects==

===Creation of a permanent underclass===
[[File:Utah State Prison Wasatch Facility.jpg|thumb|Circa 1 million people are [[United States incarceration rate|incarcerated every year in the United States]] for drug law violations.]]

Penalties for drug crimes among American youth almost always involve permanent or semi-permanent removal from opportunities for education, [[Felony disenfranchisement|strip them of voting rights]], and later involve creation of criminal records which make employment more difficult.&lt;ref name="howto-construct-underclass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/4cs/files/2008/11/blumenson-and-nilsenlawrev.pdf|title=How to construct an underclass, ''or'' how the War on Drugs became a war on education |last=Blumenson |first=Eric |author2=Eva S. Nilsen  |date=May 16, 2002 |format=PDF |publisher=Drug Policy Forum of Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some authors maintain that the War on Drugs has resulted in the creation of a permanent underclass of people who have few educational or job opportunities, often as a result of being punished for drug offenses which in turn have resulted from attempts to earn a living in spite of having no education or job opportunities.&lt;ref name="howto-construct-underclass" /&gt;

===Costs to taxpayers===
According to a 2008 study published by [[Harvard]] economist [[Jeffrey A. Miron]], the annual savings on enforcement and incarceration costs from the legalization of drugs would amount to roughly $41.3 billion, with $25.7 billion being saved among the states and over $15.6 billion accrued for the federal government. Miron further estimated at least $46.7 billion in tax revenue based on rates comparable to those on [[tobacco]] and [[alcohol]] ($8.7 billion from [[marijuana]], $32.6 billion from [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]], remainder from other drugs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/DrugProhibitionWP.pdf|title=The Budgetary Impact of Ending Drug Prohibition |publisher=CATO.org |author1=Jeffrey A. Miron  |author2=Katherine Waldock |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low taxation in Central American countries has been credited with weakening the region's response in dealing with drug traffickers. Many cartels, especially [[Los Zetas]] have taken advantage of the limited resources of these nations. 2010 tax revenue in [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Honduras]], composed just 13.53% of GDP. As a comparison, in [[Chile]] and the U.S., taxes were 18.6% and 26.9% of GDP respectively. However, [[direct taxes]] on income are very hard to enforce and in some cases tax evasion is seen as a national pastime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coha.org/low-taxation-perpetuates-insecurity-in-central-america/|title=Low Taxation Perpetuates Insecurity in Central America|website=COHA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on growers===
The status of [[coca]] and coca growers has become an intense political issue in several countries, including Colombia and particularly Bolivia, where the president, [[Evo Morales]], a former coca growers' union leader, has promised to legalise the traditional cultivation and use of coca.&lt;ref name="Conflict"&gt;Ledebur, K. and Youngers, C. 2013. From Conflict to Collaboration: An Innovative Approach to Reducing Coca Cultivation in Bolivia. [[Stability: International Journal of Security and Development]] 2(1):9, DOI: http://stabilityjournal.org/article/view/sta.aw&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, legalization efforts have yielded some successes under the Morales administration when combined with aggressive and targeted eradication efforts. The country saw a 12–13% decline in coca cultivation&lt;ref name="Conflict" /&gt; in 2011 under Morales, who has used coca growers' federations to ensure compliance with the law rather than providing a primary role for security forces.&lt;ref name="Conflict" /&gt;

The coca eradication policy has been criticised for its negative impact on the livelihood of coca growers in South America. In many areas of South America the coca leaf has traditionally been chewed and used in tea and for religious, medicinal and nutritional purposes by locals.&lt;ref name="wa-times-bolivian-coca-growers-fight"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/211-development/44365.html|title=Bolivian Coca Growers Fight Eradication|last=Lindsay|first=Reed|date=March 25, 2003 |work=Washington Times|accessdate=February 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason many insist that the illegality of traditional coca cultivation is unjust. In many areas the U.S. government and military has forced the eradication of coca without providing for any meaningful alternative crop for farmers, and has additionally destroyed many of their food or market crops, leaving them starving and destitute.&lt;ref name="wa-times-bolivian-coca-growers-fight" /&gt;

The CIA, DEA, State Department, and several other U.S. government agencies have been alleged to have relations with various groups which are involved in drug trafficking.

===CIA and Contra cocaine trafficking===
{{further|CIA and Contras cocaine trafficking in the US}}

[[US Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]]'s 1988 [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] report on Contra drug links concludes that members of the U.S. State Department "who provided support for the Contras are involved in drug trafficking... and elements of the Contras themselves knowingly receive financial and material assistance from drug traffickers."&lt;ref&gt;Cockburn and St. Clair, 1998: {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report further states that "the Contra drug links include... payments to drug traffickers by the [[U.S. State Department]] of funds authorized by the Congress for humanitarian assistance to the Contras, in some cases after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcement agencies on drug charges, in others while traffickers were under active investigation by these same agencies."

In 1996, journalist [[Gary Webb]] published reports in the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', and later in his book ''[[Dark Alliance]]'', detailing how [[Contras]], had been involved in distributing [[crack cocaine]] into Los Angeles whilst receiving money from the CIA.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Contras used money from drug trafficking to buy weapons.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Webb's premise regarding the U.S. Government connection was initially attacked at the time by the media. It is now widely accepted that Webb's main assertion of government "knowledge of drug operations, and collaboration with and protection of known drug traffickers" was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 2 – The Contras, Cocaine, and Covert Operations | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB2/nsaebb2.htm |accessdate=August 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}} In 1998, CIA [[Inspector General]] [[Frederick Hitz]] published a two-volume report&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Frederick Hitz | title = CIA Inspector General report into allegations of connections between the CIA and the Contras in cocaine trafficking to the United States | publisher = [[CIA]] | year=  1998 | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/report/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; that while seemingly refuting Webb's claims of knowledge and collaboration in its conclusions did not deny them in its body.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Hitz went on to [[CIA and Contras cocaine trafficking in the US#Testimony of the CIA Inspector General|admit]] CIA improprieties in the affair in testimony to a House congressional committee.

===Heroin trafficking operations involving the CIA, U.S. Navy and Sicilian Mafia===
{{further|Collaborations between the United States government and Italian Mafia}}
According to Rodney Campbell, an editorial assistant to Nelson Rockefeller, during World War II, the United States Navy, concerned that strikes and labor disputes in U.S. eastern shipping ports would disrupt wartime logistics, released the mobster [[Lucky Luciano]] from prison, and collaborated with him to help the mafia take control of those ports. Labor union members were terrorized and murdered by mafia members as a means of preventing labor unrest and ensuring smooth shipping of supplies to Europe.&lt;ref name="luciano-project-campbell"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Campbell|first=Rodney|title=The Luciano Project: The Secret Wartime Collaboration Between the Mafia and the U.S. Navy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-KEAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Luciano+release#search_anchor|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1977|isbn=978-0-07-009674-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair, in order to prevent [[Italian Communist Party|Communist]] party members from being elected in Italy following World War II, the CIA worked closely with the [[Sicilian Mafia]], protecting them and assisting in their worldwide heroin smuggling operations. The mafia was in conflict with leftist groups and was involved in assassinating, torturing, and beating leftist political organizers.&lt;ref name = "whiteout-luckys-break"&gt;Cockburn and St. Clair, 1998: Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the US Defense Department funded a two-year study by the [[RAND Corporation]], which found that the use of the armed forces to interdict drugs coming into the United States would have little or no effect on cocaine traffic and might, in fact, raise the profits of cocaine cartels and manufacturers. The 175-page study, "Sealing the Borders: The Effects of Increased Military Participation in Drug Interdiction", was prepared by seven researchers, mathematicians and economists at the National Defense Research Institute, a branch of the RAND, and was released in 1988. The study noted that seven prior studies in the past nine years, including one by the Center for Naval Research and the Office of Technology Assessment, had come to similar conclusions. Interdiction efforts, using current armed forces resources, would have almost no effect on cocaine importation into the United States, the report concluded.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Reuter, ''Sealing the borders: the effects of increased military participation in drug interdiction'' (RAND 1988); Robert E. Kessler, "Study: Military Can't Curb Drugs", ''Newsday'', May 23, 1988 at 23; "Military support would have little effect on drug smuggling, study says", United Press International, March 4, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early-to-mid-1990s, the [[Clinton administration]] ordered and funded a major cocaine policy study, again by RAND. The Rand Drug Policy Research Center study concluded that $3 billion should be switched from federal and local law enforcement to treatment. The report said that treatment is the cheapest way to cut drug use, stating that drug treatment is twenty-three times more effective than the supply-side "war on drugs".&lt;ref&gt;C. Peter Rydell, ''Controlling Cocaine: Supply Versus Demand Programs'' (Rand Drug Policy Research Center 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] Committee on Data and Research for Policy on Illegal Drugs published its findings in 2001 on the efficacy of the drug war. The NRC Committee found that existing studies on efforts to address drug usage and smuggling, from U.S. military operations to eradicate coca fields in Colombia, to domestic drug treatment centers, have all been inconclusive, if the programs have been evaluated at all: "The existing drug-use monitoring systems are strikingly inadequate to support the full range of policy decisions that the nation must make.... It is unconscionable for this country to continue to carry out a public policy of this magnitude and cost without any way of knowing whether and to what extent it is having the desired effect."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081205024427/http://www.dpeg.org/dpeg_2001_spg.pdf Drug Policy News], Drug Policy Education Group, Vol. 2 No.1, Spring/Summer 2001, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The study, though not ignored by the press, was ignored by top-level policymakers, leading Committee Chair [[Charles Manski]] to conclude, as one observer notes, that "the drug war has no interest in its own results".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugsense.org/dsw/2001/ds01.n215.html "Weekly News in Review"], ''DrugSense Weekly'', August 31, 2001 #215&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1995, the US government tried to reduce the supply of [[methamphetamine]] precursors to disrupt the market of this drug. According to a 2009 study, this effort was successful, but its effects were largely temporary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dobkin|first1=Carlos|last2=Nicosia|first2=Nancy|title=The War on Drugs: Methamphetamine, Public Health, and Crime|journal=American Economic Review|date=February 2009|volume=99|issue=1|pages=324–349|doi=10.1257/aer.99.1.324|pmid=20543969|pmc=2883188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Prohibition in the United States|alcohol prohibition]], the period from 1920 to 1933, alcohol use initially fell but began to increase as early as 1922. It has been extrapolated that even if prohibition had not been repealed in 1933, alcohol consumption would have quickly surpassed pre-prohibition levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-157.html |title=Alcohol Prohibition Was a Failure |publisher=Cato.org |date=July 17, 1991 |accessdate=March 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229232307/http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-157.html |archivedate=December 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One argument against the War on Drugs is that it uses similar measures as Prohibition and is no more effective.

In the six years from 2000 to 2006, the U.S. spent $4.7 billion on [[Plan Colombia]], an effort to eradicate coca production in Colombia. The main result of this effort was to shift coca production into more remote areas and force other forms of adaptation. The overall acreage cultivated for coca in Colombia at the end of the six years was found to be the same, after the U.S. Drug Czar's office announced a change in measuring methodology in 2005 and included new areas in its surveys.&lt;ref name = "est"&gt;{{cite web| date =April 14, 2006 | url =http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/news/press06/041406.html | title =2005 Coca Estimates for Colombia | publisher =Office of National Drug Control Policy |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234649/http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/news/press06/041406.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultivation in the neighboring countries of Peru and Bolivia increased, some would describe this effect like squeezing a balloon.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Forero, "Colombia's Coca Survives U.S. plan to uproot it", ''The New York Times'', August 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|10–15% of illicit heroin and 30% of illicit cocaine is intercepted. Drug traffickers have gross profit margins of up to 300%. At least 75% of illicit drug shipments would have to be intercepted before the traffickers' profits were hurt.}}

[[Alberto Fujimori]], president of Peru from 1990 to 2000, described U.S. foreign drug policy as "failed" on grounds that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;for 10 years, there has been a considerable sum invested by the Peruvian government and another sum on the part of the American government, and this has not led to a reduction in the supply of coca leaf offered for sale. Rather, in the 10 years from 1980 to 1990, it grew 10-fold.&lt;ref&gt;Don Podesta and Douglas Farah, "Drug Policy in Andes Called Failure", ''[[Washington Post]]'', March 27, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At least 500 economists, including [[Nobel Laureate]]s [[Milton Friedman]],&lt;ref name="streatfeild"&gt;Dominic Streatfeild, "Source Material for ''Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography'': Interview between Milton Friedman and Dominic Streatfeild", June 2000 [http://www.dominicstreatfeild.com/2010/11/08/interview-with-milton-friedman/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Akerlof]] and [[Vernon L. Smith]], have noted that reducing the supply of marijuana without reducing the demand causes the price, and hence the profits of marijuana sellers, to go up, according to the laws of supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An open letter |url=http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/endorsers.html |publisher=Prohibition Costs |accessdate=February 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017021537/http://prohibitioncosts.org/endorsers.html |archivedate=October 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased profits encourage the producers to produce more drugs despite the risks, providing a theoretical explanation for why attacks on drug supply have failed to have any lasting effect. The aforementioned economists published an open letter to President [[George W. Bush]] stating "We urge...the country to commence an open and honest debate about marijuana prohibition... At a minimum, this debate will force advocates of current policy to show that prohibition has benefits sufficient to justify the cost to [[taxpayer]]s, foregone tax revenues and numerous ancillary consequences that result from marijuana prohibition."

The declaration from the World Forum Against Drugs, 2008 state that a balanced policy of drug abuse prevention, education,
treatment, law enforcement, research, and supply reduction provides the most effective platform to reduce drug abuse and its associated harms and call on governments to consider [[demand reduction]] as one of their first priorities in the fight against drug abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfad.se/about-wfad/wfad-declaration Declaration of World Forum Against Drugs, Stockholm 2008.

==Legality==
{{Main|Legality of the War on Drugs}}

The legality of the War on Drugs has been challenged on four main grounds in the U.S.
# It is argued that drug prohibition, as presently implemented, violates the [[substantive due process]] doctrine in that its benefits do not justify the encroachments on rights that are supposed to be guaranteed by the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. On July 27, 2011, U.S. District Judge Mary S. Scriven ruled that Florida's legislation purporting to eliminate intent as an element of the crime of drug possession was unconstitutional. Commentators explained the ruling in terms of due process.
# Freedom of religious conscience legally allows some (for example, members of the [[Native American Church]]) to use [[peyote]] with definite spiritual or religious motives. The sacramental use of [[dimethyltryptamine]] in the form of [[ayahuasca]] is also allowed for members of [[União do Vegetal]]. The [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] implies no requirement for someone to be affiliated to an official church – therefore leaving some ambiguity.
# It has been argued that the [[Commerce Clause]] means that the power to regulate drug use should be state law not federal law.
# The inequity of prosecuting the war on certain drugs but not alcohol or tobacco has also been called into question.

==Alternatives==
{{See also|Responsible drug use}}
Several authors believe that the United States' federal and state governments have chosen wrong methods for combatting the distribution of illicit substances. Aggressive, heavy-handed enforcement funnels individuals through courts and prisons; instead of treating the cause of the addiction, the focus of government efforts has been on punishment. By making drugs illegal rather than regulating them, the War on Drugs creates a highly profitable black market. [[Jefferson Fish]] has edited scholarly collections of articles offering a wide variety of public health based and rights based alternative drug policies.&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M. (Ed.) (1998). ''How to legalize drugs''. Northvale, New Jersey: Jason Aronson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M. (Ed.) (2000). "Is our drug policy effective? Are there alternatives?" New York City, New York: ''Fordham Urban Law Journal''. (Proceedings of the March 17 &amp; 18, 2000 joint conference of the New York Academy of Sciences, New York Academy of Medicine, and Association of the Bar of the City of New York. Vol. 23, No. 1, pp. 3–262.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M. (Ed.) (2006). ''Drugs and society: U. S. public policy''. Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2000, the United States drug-control budget reached 18.4 billion dollars,&lt;ref name="Alter, Jonathan 2001, pp. 37-43"&gt;Alter, Jonathan. "The War on Addiction". ''Newsweek'', February 12, 2001, pp. 37–43&lt;/ref&gt; nearly half of which was spent financing law enforcement while only one sixth was spent on treatment. In the year 2003, 53 percent of the requested drug control budget was for enforcement, 29 percent for treatment, and 18 percent for prevention.&lt;ref&gt;''How Goes the "War on Drugs": An Assessment of U.S. Drug Problems and Policy''. RAND Corporation Drug Policy Research Center, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The state of New York, in particular, designated 17 percent of its budget towards substance-abuse-related spending. Of that, a mere one percent was put towards prevention, treatment, and research.

In a survey taken by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), it was found that substance abusers that remain in treatment longer are less likely to resume their former drug habits. Of the people that were studied, 66 percent were cocaine users. After experiencing long-term in-patient treatment, only 22 percent returned to the use of cocaine. Treatment had reduced the number of cocaine abusers by two-thirds.&lt;ref name="Alter, Jonathan 2001, pp. 37-43"/&gt; By spending the majority of its money on law enforcement, the federal government had underestimated the true value of drug-treatment facilities and their benefit towards reducing the number of addicts in the U.S.

In 2004 the federal government issued the National Drug Control Strategy. It supported programs designed to expand treatment options, enhance treatment delivery, and improve treatment outcomes. For example, the Strategy provided SAMHSA with a $100.6 million grant to put towards their Access to Recovery (ATR) initiative. ATR is a program that provides vouchers to addicts to provide them with the means to acquire clinical treatment or recovery support. The project's goals are to expand capacity, support client choice, and increase the array of faith-based and community based providers for clinical treatment and recovery support services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atr.samhsa.gov/|title=Recovery to Practice Resources|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ATR program will also provide a more flexible array of services based on the individual's treatment needs.

The 2004 Strategy additionally declared a significant 32 million dollar raise in the Drug Courts Program, which provides drug offenders with alternatives to incarceration. As a substitute for imprisonment, drug courts identify substance-abusing offenders and place them under strict court monitoring and community supervision, as well as provide them with long-term treatment services.&lt;ref name="whitehouse-policy-2004"&gt;[http://whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/policy/ndcs04/index.html The President's National Drug Control Strategy], ''White House'', 2004. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213091104/http://whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/policy/ndcs04/index.html |date=February 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report issued by the National Drug Court Institute, drug courts have a wide array of benefits, with only 16.4 percent of the nation's drug court graduates rearrested and charged with a felony within one year of completing the program (versus the 44.1% of released prisoners who end up back in prison within 1-year). Additionally, enrolling an addict in a drug court program costs much less than incarcerating one in prison.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Huddleston, C. West III, et al. ''Painting the Current Picture: A National Report Card on Drug Courts and Other Problem Solving Court Programs in the United States'', Vol. 1, Num. 1, May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bureau of Prisons, the fee to cover the average cost of incarceration for Federal inmates in 2006 was $24,440.&lt;ref&gt;Lappin, Harley G. Annual Determination of Average Cost of Incarceration. Department of Justice – Bureau of Prisons. June 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The annual cost of receiving treatment in a drug court program ranges from $900 to $3,500. Drug courts in New York State alone saved $2.54 million in incarceration costs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Describing the failure of the War on Drugs, ''New York Times'' columnist Eduardo Porter noted:

{{quote|Jeffrey Miron, an economist at Harvard who studies drug policy closely, has suggested that legalizing all illicit drugs would produce net benefits to the United States of some $65 billion a year, mostly by cutting public spending on enforcement as well as through reduced crime and corruption. A study by analysts at the RAND Corporation, a California research organization, suggested that if marijuana were legalized in California and the drug spilled from there to other states, Mexican drug cartels would lose about a fifth of their annual income of some $6.5 billion from illegal exports to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Porter |first= Eduardo |date= July 3, 2012 |title= Numbers Tell of Failure in Drug War |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/business/in-rethinking-the-war-on-drugs-start-with-the-numbers.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many believe that the War on Drugs has been costly and ineffective largely because inadequate emphasis is placed on treatment of [[addiction]].

The '''widowhood effect''' is the increase in the probability of a person dying a relatively short time  after their long-time [[spouse]] has died. The pattern indicates a sharp increase in risk of death for the widower, particularly but not exclusively, in the three months closest thereafter the death of the spouse. This process of losing a spouse and dying shortly after has also been called "dying of a [[broken heart]]". Becoming a widow is often a very detrimental and life changing time in a spouse's life, that forces them to go through changes that they may not have anticipated to make for a significant amount of time. Responses of grief and bereavement due to the loss of a spouse increases vulnerability to psychological and physical illnesses (Ramadas &amp; Kuttichira, 2013).

Psychologically, losing a long-term spouse can cause symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt. Physical illness may also occur as the body becomes more vulnerable to emotional and environmental stressors. There are many factors that may be affected when one becomes a widow. A widow (or widower if referring to a male who lost a spouse) tends to have a decline in health regulation. Higher prevalence in mortality rates are noted among bereaved spouses during the first six months of bereavement compared to the last six months of bereavement.  The most crucial are said to be the first three months during grief processing.  Grieving spouses are more vulnerable during these few months not only health wise but socially and physically.  During this early period of bereavement spouses tend to have less interest in their health as well as physical appearance caring less about continuing with medications or adapting healthy behaviors such as eating healthy or exercising.  Also, they are likelier to practice risky behaviors and commit suicide.  Men on the other hand, are more likely to look for social support such as friends, family, or support groups regarding the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, P. J., Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011). Does Widowhood Increase Mortality Risk? Epidemiology, 22(1), 1-5. doi:10.1097/ede.0b013e3181fdcc0b&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect appears to be far more prevalent in older married couples than in younger married couples. As a result, studies that have been conducted in regards to this phenomenon since the early 2000s have revolved primarily around observations of older widows. Through the many studies that have been conducted over the years, it has been found that the widowhood effect affects the mortality rates of people with varying levels of severity depending on their genders and religions.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}}It is far more frequent in more seasoned, long-term, elder couples than in recently married couples. Since the topic has only been recently studied within this last decade, and due to the prevalence of older couples being affected, most widows in similar studies are typically over the age of 50&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-widowhood-effect-idUSBRE9AD0VU20131114|title='Widowhood effect' strongest during first three months|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Jegtvig, 2013).

Although there have not been many studies, the phenomenon is one of the best documented examples of the effect of social relations on health. Through the numerous studies that have been directed throughout the years, it has been found that the widowhood impact influences the death rates of individuals with changing levels of stringencies relying upon their sexual orientations and religions. There are many theories as to what causes this to occur. There are many factors and theories about the widowhood effect, but in general, a study on a large population sample has suggested rates of death nearly double during the first three months after loss of a spouse, and quickly taper thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moon|first=J.

==Gender differences==

Both men and women respond differently to the death of their spouse. In general, men tend to be more vulnerable to the widowhood effect. Men are affected more socially than women.  Women tend to maintain social relationships and friendships outside of marriage, so when the wife dies first, men tend to lose out on these social relationships and support groups and they tend to isolate themselves. Women maintain their friendships and relationships and lean on them for support after their spouse dies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2136854 Widowhood and Depression: Explaining Long-Term Gender Differences in Vulnerability.] ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior.'' (1992). Retrieved on 2016-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of peer-reviewed articles suggest that it is indeed women that are more frequently at risk of succumbing to the widowhood effect. A collaborative study by Gary R. Lee et al. (2001) surveyed 1686 married and widowed people age 65 or older using data from 1988 [[National Survey of Families and Households]]. The study took into account the psychological well-being of each person on a [[Center for Epidemiologic Studies]]— Depression scale (CES-D), and found that women were further depressed by the loss of their spouse than men were. Women were also more likely to die soon after the death of their spouse compared to men. The researchers hypothesized that this was because older married women had a higher baseline happiness than their spouses, so they had more happiness to lose. Women in this study were also less likely to be avid church goers, despised chores, and were not as adept at helping their adult children. The lack of social behavior and general activity may contribute to the widowhood effect's influence on female mortality.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"&gt;{{cite web |date=April 18, 2016 |title=Is Broken Heart Syndrome Difficult? |url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/Cardiomyopathy/Is-Broken-Heart-Syndrome-Difficult_UCM_448547_Article.jsp |location=Dallas |publisher=American Heart Association |access-date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lee|DeMaris|Bavin|Sullivan|2001}}

Experimenters involved in the study regarding: ''The effects of widowhood on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and health outcomes'', took a deeper look into the overall health differences between recent widowers and those who are currently involved in a marriage (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Mental health alterations include those of depression and socially extracting yourself were the most common for women who have become widowed in the past year or so (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Although some of these women were shown to extract them selves from social settings, the study also supported an alternate hypothesis that women experiencing the effects of widowhood are less likely to engage coping mechanisms such as support groups, fellow widowers, and overall strong support systems such as close friends and family (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003).

In a study done by Stahl and Shultz, they found that the death of a woman’s spouse affected her physical activity (2014). Women’s physical activity increases immediately following the death of a spouse, and the authors note that this may perhaps be a coping mechanism to alleviate depressive symptoms (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). In the year following the death of a spouse, women are more likely to experience a fluctuation in physical activity during the transition into widowhood, if they did not die (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). Women in the youngest age group of this study (55– 65 years) were at the highest risk of mortality after the death of their spouse (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Elwert and Christakis found that within the first month of bereavement after widowhood morality is largest and doesn’t decline sharply until the sixth month of widowhood for females, compared to only the third month for males (2006).

Nicholas A. Christakis of Harvard and Felix Elwert of the University of Wisconsin analyzed 9 years’ worth of data gathered from almost 373,189 elderly married couples in the U.S. Their findings showed an 18 percent increase in “all-cause mortality” for women whose husbands died first; for men, the risk is 16 percent (Elwert 2008). Although the percentage of females was higher than males, it is not a significant difference to state that women are more affected than men. It is hard to say whether males or females suffer from the widowhood effect more, however it is clear that it is higher in couples that are older.

&lt;ref&gt;In conclusion to this, other research that has been conducted has gathered similar statistics regarding widowhood effect between genders. A comparable study taken place in the U.S found that “The death of a husband is associated with a greater rate in all-cause mortality for women, and the death of a wife is associated with a lesser rate in all-cause mortality for men, after adjusting for covariates (Elwert, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health effects of widowhood==
The death of a spouse can have a major impact on a person’s mental health. Each individual may respond to their spouse’s death differently. After the death of a spouse many widows begin to take more prescription medications for mental health issues (Avis, Brambilla, Vass, &amp; Mckinlay, 1991). The mental health effects of men and women also differ. Women become more depressed in widowhood compared to men because women may not have as strong of a support group. Married women also report a higher rate of happiness in their marriage and the death of their spouse could drastically alter this happiness. Men may have an easier time adapting to widowhood and be more willing to seek mental help while women tend to be less social and did not like to do chores, go to church, or help their children. Men and women both show greater rates of depression after the death of a spouse but the rates of depression in women tends to be higher than in men (Lee, DeMaris, &amp; Sullivan, 2001).

==Takotsubo and the widowhood effect==

Recently, there has been a phenomenon discussed and researched dubbed the takotsubo condition, also referred to as the [[broken heart syndrome]] (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Takotsubo has been discussed in contexts surrounding great physical and emotional stress, such as circumstance in which someone has been widowed, and emotional stress has long been associated with myocardial infarction. In their research, Brenn and Ytterstad saw an increase in death of women 55–64 years old due to heart disease in the first week of widowhood than married women 55–64 years old (2016). Although takotsubo is not considered to be the direct cause of death at this time, it is an observed phenomenon (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016.)

==Effects of widowhood on social life==

Elderly widows experience changes in their social lives prior to and following the deaths of their spouses. A study conducted by Rebecca L. Utz et al. (2002) revealed that elderly persons experiencing widowhood spent more time with family and friends than nonwidowed counterparts, based on the lifestyle changes that occur in elderly couples. Although widowed subjects were more likely to socialize with family and friends, they were no more likely to visit church or volunteer than the intact couples. This study also found that healthy spouses were reclusive while their significant other was on their deathbed, but due to a network of family and friends; the surviving spouse entered society being more social than had been prior to the death of their husband or wife. Elderly widows were more or less involved socially depending on the amount of support they had from family and friends.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}} It has been noted that widows who have a close and supportive social network can counteract the effects of widowhood by remaining active in their social group. The loss of a spouse affects almost every domain of life, and as a consequence has a significant impact on wellbeing: psychological, social, physical, practical, and economic (Bennett, 2012). With all of these aspects of a widowed individuals being affected maintaining a sense of normality is important to help avoid depression like symptoms. Social support, as well as creating new lasting relationships through social interaction can help the process of bereavement go smoother for widow effected individuals.

==Urban, rural and race variations==

A study conducted by Rosato, O’Reilly and Wright (2015) revealed that there is a significant difference in urban-rural variation in the social environment as well as in health outcomes. There is evidence that social support from family and friends have better health outcomes on mortality rates. Investigations showed that the race of the partner influences widowhood effect; whites in endogamous marriages had greater mortality risks that were not obvious among blacks, which the authors concluded was due to a high level of family support for elderly among black families versuswhite families. Moreover, the study also found differences in urban and rural areas around the world. They found that elderly married couples in the US suffered significant mortality risks compared to those in Ireland where older people living in more rural areas receive more social support from their families, and they live with their children, while in the US elderly people live in care homes. As a result, mortality rates are greater in urban areas and less in rural areas.

In a study done by Elwert and Christakis, they found that there was no widowhood effect found in endogamously married black men or women (2016). Deducing this finding, they proposed that this might be because blacks are able to extend their marital survival advantage into widowhood. This is likely because blacks are prone to have kin nearer to help take care of them, they may be more self-sufficient than their white counterparts, and there is greater religious participation in blacks that may help them with spiritual comfort (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2016). Whites were found to have “a large and enduring widowhood effect” because there is no reparation to make up for the survival advantages that marriage gave them, even if they have been widowed for years (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2008).

The widowhood effect appears to have a higher impact in rural and intermediate areas compared to urban areas. One factor may be that there are greater distances to primary care services in rural areas, and this increases mortality due to discouraged health checkups (Wright, 2015). It is known that the size of family and social network coincides with physical functioning; the bigger the social group one belongs to the better they can physically function. Residential areas near green areas are associated with an increase in physical activity and lowered mortality (Wright, 2015). Researchers measured peak flow to show the increases or decreases in physical functioning, and the results suggest that married subjects have a higher peak flow compared to those divorced or widowed (Clouston, 2014).

==Possible causes==

It was suggested that the widowhood effect was a mere coincidence resulting from the selection of mates with similar health risk. In a recent study by Paul J. Boyle, Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011), it was concluded that the increased [[mortality rate]] of widows is caused by the death of their spouse. Researchers in the study used data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study to compare the ratios of death in widowed males and females. The male and female subjects were categorized into different groups dependent on the manner in which their spouse died. The results provided evidence that suggest a causal relationship between mortality rate and widowhood.{{sfn|Boyle|Feng|Raab|2011}}

In April 2016, the [[American Heart Association]] published an article regarding phenomenon referred to as "broken heart syndrome". This particular syndrome seems to occur when a person experiences an overwhelming amount of stress in their life in a short period of time. The cases mentioned involved both positive events like winning the lottery as well as negative events like experiencing the death of a spouse. Though broken heart syndrome has been misdiagnosed as a heart attack, the differences between the two phenomena are clear. Heart attacks are the result of a blockage of arteries, but broken heart syndrome is the result of a hormone induced enlargement of a portion of the heart. The enlarged region of the heart is less effective in regards to pumping blood, and the normal sized regions of the heart are forced to work harder as a result.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"/&gt;


== Widowhood Effect Solution == 
	Widowhood effect is important to be aware of because of the affects that it can have on the body; mentally, physically, emotionally. Although there is no correct coping mechanism when losing a partner, it is important to find preventative ways to fight this from occurring because of the depressive symptoms and state of mental health that are a result from a partner passing away. Being aware of widowhood effect and acknowledging the feelings, such as grieving over that individual can be a way of coping with their current situation. Individuals that result to safe methods with grieving such as counseling or finding different hobbies can decrease their chances of experiencing widowhood effect. 


== Coping Mechanisms ==
There is no universally accepted “proper” method or way to grieve or adjust to life after loss; it varies among individuals, influenced by their cultural and social practices, personality, and the circumstances surrounding the death. Even though grief processing varies, there are ways to reduce the effects of widowhood. Since a spouse is often one’s primary source of social interactions, maintaining and establishing social bonds is a crucial aspect in determining the outcome of a widowed individual’s bereavement (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Social participation may be utilized “as an active coping strategy” as discovered in a study by Rebecca Utz and colleagues (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Additionally, the loss of a spouse means the loss of a partner; the loss of a supportive presence with whom responsibility was shared amongst one another. Studies have shown that for couples who followed traditional gender roles, adjustment to life after their loss was often more difficult than for couples who did not (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Undertaking the responsibilities previously considered the ‘job’ of one’s deceased partner is often hard to handle on top of processing the loss; therefore, the utilization of organizations built to support and help widowed individuals may also prove to be helpful in reducing grief. The Widowed Persons Service (WPS) and their parent organization, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), are two organizations which provide aid specifically to widowed individuals (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Effective and safe methods of grief processing are important for all individuals dealing with loss; however, the utilization of organizations may prove to be beneficial for those who need a little more help.

Zhu graduated from the Affiliated High School of the [[China Central Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1991. His work deals with subjects of [[contemporary art]].

==Background==
Zhu Yu is often termed the most controversial and criticized artist in China. Zhu graduated from the Affiliated High School of the Central Academy of Fine Arts in 1991. His contemporary performance art raises questions about moral agendas, and draws an audience through its shock value. His artwork often encompasses the human body.  He is categorized by some critics as an artist of the “cadaver school,” which consists of artists who tend to use human body parts in their work.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4488657|title=Violent Capital: Zhu Yu on File|first=Meiling|last=Cheng|date=2 October 2018|journal=TDR (1988-)|volume=49|issue=3|pages=58–77|accessdate=2 October 2018|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yu's most famous piece of [[conceptual art]], titled "Eating People," was performed at a [[Shanghai]] [[arts festival]] in 2000.

Images from the piece have also been used in anti-Chinese propaganda, disseminated by e-mail with a short text attached explaining the images show China's "hottest food" and that dead fetuses can be bought for 10-12,000 Yen (approximately US$100 - US$120). Recipients are encouraged to forward the mail, and the explanatory text is written in both English and Korean script.

==Exhibitions==
Zhu Yu has been involved in many group exhibitions including Post-Sense Sensibility- Alien Bodies &amp; Delusion in Beijing (January 1999), and The Third Guangzhou Triennial in Guangzhou (September 2008), which involved 181 artists from 40 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/29575/third-guangzhou-triennial/|title=Third Guangzhou Triennial|author=Charles LaBelle|work=[[Artinfo]]|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Most notable is his work at the [[Fuck Off (art exhibition)|Fuck Off]] Exhibit curated by [[Ai Weiwei]] and [[Feng Boyi]] in Shanghai, 2000. This controversial exhibit hosted 48 contemporary avant-garde artists. This is where his most controversial piece of performance art “Eating People” appeared. Among his other solo exhibitions are Plaything (Long March Space, Beijing 2010) and Leftover (Xin Beijing Art Gallery, Beijing, 2007).

==Significant Works==
'''The Foundation of All Epistemology''': This work appeared in the 1998 group exhibition ''It’s All Right'' in Shanghai. For this piece, Zhu Yu cut and boiled five human brains which were purchased from a local hospital. He placed them in neatly labeled jars that he then signed with his own name. Zhu put these jars of brains up for sale in a market that sponsored the exhibit. He ended up selling 15 bottles each for the price of 98 yuans.

'''Eating People''': In his performance art piece Eating People, Zhu photographs himself cooking and eating a human fetus that he divided into five parts. Zhu says that “I herewith announce my intention and my aim to eat people as a protest against mankind’s moral idea that he/she cannot eat people.” &lt;ref&gt;Fuck Off! Please, 2000; Ai Weiwei, Feng Boyi&lt;/ref&gt; In further response to Zhu’s bold performance, The Ministry of Culture cited a menace to social order and the spiritual health of the Chinese people, and banned exhibitions involving culture, animal abuse, corpses, and overt violence and sexuality.&lt;ref name="录像作品《朱昱侮辱尸体案》文字记录"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New China, new art; Munich ; New York : Prestel, c2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this piece did not even appear at the exhibit; The night before the exhibition, Ai Weiwei collaborated with Zhu and the photographs were removed from the gallery. This piece was thought particularly controversial, and organizers did not want to risk government censorship for the rest of the exhibit. The response to this work stemmed from its appearance on the internet shortly after. ''Eating People'' appeared in Malaysia's ''Perdan Weekly'' without caption and generated the question of whether eating babies was accepted in Asia on various myth-debunking websites.

'''Pocket Theology''': Appearing in the 1999 group exhibition ''Post-Sense Sensibility- Alien Bodies &amp; Delusion'' in Beijing, curated by Wu Meichun and Qiu Zhije. A long coiling rope was gripped by a severed, decomposing arm which was suspended by a meat hook.  This display was held in a small room in the basement that was being rented by a group of Chinese artists who organize the exhibition. Viewers were forced to walk over the rope which filled the entire space.

'''Skin Graft''':&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary Chinese Art: Primary Documents, New York : Museum of Modern Art ; Durham, N.C. : Distributed by Duke University Press, c2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This performance art installation appeared in the 2000 exhibition ''Infatuation with Injury'' organized by Li Xianting. In the exhibit, Zhu uses his own flesh as a canvas. Photos were shown of trunk of a quartered pig lying on a hospital bed. Zhu grafted a piece of his own skin onto a section of damaged skin from the pig. Two photos of this process appeared in the exhibit; one that showed the surgical process, and another which featured the artist sewing his own skin onto the pig carcass. Zhu stood by the exhibit and lifted his shirt to show the scar which stood as evidence of the procedure.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

'''Leftover''': This series was exhibited by the Xin Beijing Art Gallery at the China International Gallery Exposition.  Zhu photographed plates that held bits of leftover food, and then painted those images on canvas with oil. Eight paintings appeared at the Xin Beijing Art Gallery.

==Recent Works==

Zhu Yu’s most recent works follow his ideas with the Leftover exhibit, in which he paints highly detailed portraits of mundane objects. His series “Stain,” features a bird’s-eye view of teacups that contain the dregs of tea leaves. The next series, “Pebble,” appeared at Zhu’s solo exhibition ''Play Thing'', at the [http://www.longmarchspace.com/index.html Long March Space] in Beijing, 2010. This is another series of highly detailed, realistic paintings that show individual pebbles, each featuring a slightly different hue or shape. This work implies that all life can be reduced to a pebble, a simple object from which much meaning can be derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longmarchspace.com/artist/list_8_brief.html?locale=en_US|title=LONG MARCH SPACE|work=longmarchspace.com|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
