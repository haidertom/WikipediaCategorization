[[File:Accra Brewery Limited Corporate Logo.jpg|alt=|thumb|Accra Brewery Limited corporate logo]]
'''Accra Brewery Limited''' is a [[brewery]] based in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]].

== Background ==
In 1931, Accra Brewery Limited (ABL), first registered in Switzerland as Overseas Breweries Limited, was built in Adabraka, becoming West Africa's first brewery. The company's establishment marked the beginning of Ghana's non-traditional manufacturing industry, with CLUB Premium Lager, its flagship brand,  becoming Ghana's first manufactured product. In 1975, the assets of Overseas Breweries Ltd. were taken over by the locally registered Accra Brewery Ltd. (ABL) to facilitate Ghanaian participation in the business. In October 2016, ABL became a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev ([[Anheuser-Busch InBev|ABInBev]]) after the latter acquired controlling shares of ABL's former parent company, SABMiller Plc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gh.linkedin.com/company/accra-brewery-limited|title=About Accra Brewery Limited|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Accra Brewery Limited’s (ABL) history began in 1931 when Overseas Breweries Ltd., a Swiss-registered company built the brewery in Adabraka, in an area later designated as the South Industrial Area of Accra.

The Nathan Institute of Zurich, Switzerland, was contracted to see to the general supervision of all construction works, installation of plant and machinery, and brewery technology.   The building contract was awarded to Turner &amp; Schilling, a local firm who, with the assistance of over 500 workers, completed all the buildings for the official opening.

The Governor of the Gold Coast, Sir Shenton Thomas, inaugurated the Brewery, setting the company up as Ghana’s first non-traditional manufacturing company, and the first brewery in West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accrabrewery.com.gh|title=Our Heritage|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ABL in the 1930s ===
A number of factors threatened to derail the company’s fortunes in the 1930s.

a) Its flagship brand, CLUB Premium Lager, had to compete against a variety of imported beers.

b) That era’s recession generally impacted industries around the world, affecting the sale of beer which was considered a luxury.

c)The subsequent outbreak of World War II disrupted the constant flow of raw materials, spares, etc.

=== First Year of Production ===
In the first year of operation, a quantity of 24,411 cases = 8,878hl of beer and 2,076 dozen of soda and mineral water were sold. This was just enough to break even: for 1933/34, the books showed a moderate profit of £60.   The following year, sales made was 54,102 cases of beer = 19,500hl and 6,795 dozens soda and mineral waters which meant that we produced nearly at as full as the installed capacity for the whole year which was about 20,00hl.   From 1935 onwards, the company’s Board was able to repay its capital debts and declare a modest dividend of 7% of the equity capital.

=== Expansion Period===
Ghanaians embraced CLUB Premium Lager after World War II, necessitating that production keep pace with demand.  Factory buildings were, therefore, enlarged and new machinery and equipment were installed, bringing the company to current standards of brewery technology.   In the early 60s, the capacity of its fermenting hall was also enlarged with the installation of 20 new fermenting vessels.   Another key achievement was the construction of a new bottling plant, which was equipped with a new bottling line comprising a bottle-washing machine, a filler/corker unit, pasteurizer, and a labelling machine.

In the 60s, ABL embarked upon a 4-Phase expansion programme that would have more than doubled its production capacity.   While general economic constraints prevented that from happening, the company succeeded in completing Phase 1 which involved the installation of a new 700,000 hectolitre brew house at C5 million.

=== New Ownership and Expansion ===
The company’s ownership was revised in 1975 following the passage of an Investment Law.   Consequently, Overseas Breweries Ltd. acquired 45% shares, the government of Ghana bought 40% shares, and the remaining 15% shares were floated to the Ghanaian public.   In view of this new arrangement, Sekar Limited was brought in as Technical Management, formally heralding the company’s new and current identity as Accra Brewery Limited (ABL).

=== As Accra Brewery Ltd ===
In spite of the company’s initial successes and strides, it was still saddled with problems.   Favourable government policies in the mid-80s, however, improved its fortunes, resulting in increased production levels to meet consumer demand.   The company was also able to continue its stalled 4-Phase programme, which consisted of the installation of a new Bottling Plant and Warehouse pegged at C6.2 billion with a 100% production target.   On the occasion of its 60th milestone, the company financed the construction of a new bottling hall and warehouse at a cost of C1.8 billion, from its own resources through re-investment of earned profit.

=== As a subsidiary of SABMiller Plc ===
In 1997, SABMiller Plc {then South African Breweries (SAB)} acquired controlling shares of ABL through its acquisition of Overseas Breweries Ltd.   The acquisition and subsequent infusion of capital and expertise propelled the expansion of its brand portfolio with the introduction of Castle Milk Stout, and very recently, Beta Malt, unto the Ghanaian market.   Capping this era is the USD130 million expansion project that has resulted in the construction and installation of three new packaging lines  warehouse with hard stand and loading area  electricity substation  two additional power generators  ten new beer tanks  two additional water storage tanks  a water treatment plant  sidewalks for location road  and a new entrance with gate house and offices.   The expansion was necessary and urgent as a result of the increasing need to meet consumer demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gh.linkedin.com/company/accra-brewery-limited|title=About us|last=|first=|date=|website=LinkedIn|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABInBev) ===
In October, 2016, ABL became a subsidiary of [[ABInBev]] after it acquired SABMiller Plc.

== Brands ==
ABL has been manufacturing CLUB Premium Lager for over 85 years.    CLUB Premium Lager sold under the tagline, “Beer deԑ ԑnoaa ne CLUB” and the moniker ‘Charlie’ is Ghana’s #1 selling beer.   The company introduced CLUB Shandy in the early 1990s, and Castle Milk Stout in the mid 90s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.castlemilkstout.co.za|title=About Castle Milk Stout|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Eagle Lager was introduced in the 2010s while Beta Malt in PET pack was introduced in 2015. The company launched Belgian pilsner, Stella Artois&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://accrabrewery.com.gh/accra-brewery-limited-launches-stella-artois/|title=Accra Brewery Limited launches Stella Artois|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Eagle Extra Stout, and Beta Malt in Returnable Glass Bottles (RGB) in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://accrabrewery.com.gh/abl-launches-beta-malt-in-returnable-glass-bottle/|title=ABL launches Beta Malt in Returnable Glass Bottle|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Adolfas Šleževičius''' (born 2 February 1948 in Mirčiškės, [[Šiauliai County]], [[Lithuania]]) is a former [[Prime Minister of Lithuania]].

Previously a manager in a state dairy company, Šleževičius was appointed Prime Minister following the election of [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] as President in February 1993. At the time, Lithuania was faced with monthly inflation of 10–30% despite the demonetization of the ruble and introduction of the [[Lithuanian talonas|talonas]] (coupon money) on 1 October 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Bank of Lithuania, "The Bank of Lithuania", 1994&lt;/ref&gt; After initially promising large wage hikes to state workers, Šleževičius implemented a smaller increase and backed a tightening of monetary policy by the [[Bank of Lithuania]]. This brought monthly inflation down from 25% in May 1993 to 13% in May, 6% in June, and 3% in July.&lt;ref&gt;Knobl, Camard, et al., "Lithuania" IMF Economic Review No. 6, August 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; With this progress in stabilization, the Litas Committee (composed of Šleževičius, President Brazauskas, and Bank of Lithuania President Visokavičius) announced the reintroduction of the [[Lithuanian litas]] as national currency, to take place on 25 June 1993. The exchange rate strengthened from the equivalent of over 5 litai to 3.5 litai by August 1993.

In October 1993, Šleževičius announced that the value of the litas would be fixed in a manner similar to that of the [[Estonian Kroon]], that is, in a currency board arrangement with a fixed parity.&lt;ref&gt;Camard, Wayne, "Lessons from the Currency Board Arrangement in Lithuania" IMF paper PPAA/96/1, March 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The litas Stability Law (Law I-407) was enacted on 23 March 1994, and the exchange rate fixed at 3.9 litai per U.S. dollar on 1 April 1994. The fixing of the exchange rate contributed to large capital inflows from abroad, which helped to finance the modernization of the economy in the years to follow. 

He was forced to resign on 8 February 1996, after a vote of no confidence in the Lithuanian Seimas following charges of corruption. Šleževičius had withdrawn his assets at the last minute from two banks which collapsed. He faced criminal charges regarding corruption and forgery, but after four years of investigation the case was dismissed before reaching a court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balsas.lt/naujiena/182395/isbrido-sausas/rubrika:naujienos-lietuva-politika Išbrido sausas]&lt;/ref&gt; After his abortive political career, Šleževičius turned to private business.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1283">'''Average Daily Rate''' (commonly referred to as ADR) is a [[Statistics|statistical]] unit that is often used in the [[lodging]] industry. The number represents the [[average]] rental income per paid occupied room in a given time period. ADR along with the property's [[occupancy]] are the foundations for the property's financial performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Robert|title=Hospitality Marketing Management, 5th Edition|year=2009|publisher=Wiley and Sons|pages=305–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ADR is one of the commonly used financial indicators in [[hotel industry]] used to measure how well a [[hotel]] performs compared to its competitors and itself (year over year). It is common in the hotel industry for the ADR to gradually increase year over year bringing in more [[revenue]]. However, ADR itself is not enough to measure the performance of the hotel. One should combine ADR, occupancy and [[RevPAR]] ([[revenue]] per available room) to make a sound judgment on hotel performance.

==Formula==
ADR is calculated by dividing the rooms revenue earned by the number of rooms sold, with ''house use rooms'' and ''complimentary rooms'' excluded from the denominators.

A '''common fund''' is a form of [[collective investment scheme]] based upon contractual law rather than being enacted through a [[Trust law|trust]], [[corporation]] or [[insurance policy]].

The model for this type of arrangement is the [[Fonds commun de placement]] common in [[France]] and [[Luxembourg]].  The [[common contractual fund]] in [[Ireland]] is another prominent example.

{{For|the job position related to building and managing (online) communities|Online community manager}}
A '''community association manager''' is a [[management|manager]] of a [[condominium]] or [[homeowners association]] (including [[single-family detached home|single-family home]] subdivisions, townhouses, or [[mixed-use development]]).  The position is frequently confused with a [[property manager]], who deals with individual rental units or a group of rental units, like an [[Apartment building|apartment complex]]. The community manager deals with property owners and homeowners.

People with this position are also sometimes called '''community managers''', which is distinct from [[online community manager]]s.

==Types==

On-site manager: This type of manager works in the community which he or she manages.

Portfolio manager: This type of community manager oversees several communities and is often paid on a [[commission (remuneration)|commission basis]].

Large-scale manager: Typically, large scale managers are also on-site managers. The [[Community Associations Institute]] offers certification for Large-scale managers and notes the following description: This designation allows a professional holding the PCAM (Professional Community Association Manager) designation to specialize in issues facing larger community associations. To be considered for this designation, the candidate must already be a manager of a large-scale community of over 1200 units, {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} and a budget of at least $1.5m.

==Florida Specific==

The state of Florida requires community association managers to hold a license. Performing duties as a CAM without a license is a violation of Florida Statutes. 

A link to the Department of Professional and Business Regulation, as well as a Frequently Asked Question PDF file, is included in the Reference section below.

==Credentials==
Organizations like the Community Associations Institute offer rigorous courses for professional managers to obtain their certification. The Community Association Managers International Certification Board's (CAMICB) (A different organization) provides internationally accredited certifications. Some common certifications include Certified Manager of Community Associations (CMCA) offered through the CAMICB, Association Management Specialist (AMS), and Professional Community Association Manager (PCAM).  Being able to find a professional management company is an important task for many board members.

'''Community unionism''', also known as reciprocal unionism, refers to the formation of alliances between unions and non-labour groups in order to achieve common goals.&lt;ref name="10.1093/jeg/lbn011"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Economic geography: A contemporary introduction * Neil Coe, Philip Kelly and Henry Yeung|last = |first = |date = |journal = Journal of Economic Geography|volume = 8|issue = 4|pages = 581|doi = 10.1093/jeg/lbn011|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2007|last1 = James|first1 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These unions seek to organize the employed, unemployed, and underemployed.&lt;ref name="blacksimon"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Community Unionism: A Strategy for Organizing in the New Economy|last = |first = |date = |journal = New Labor Forum|volume = 14|issue = 3|pages = 24|doi = 10.1080/1095760500245383|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2005|last1 = Black|first1 = Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; They press for change in the workplace and beyond, organizing around issues such as [[welfare reform]], [[health care]], jobs, housing, and [[immigration]]. Individual issues at work are seen as being a part of broader societal problems which they seek to address. Unlike [[trade unions]], community union membership is not based on the workplace- it is based on common identities and issues.&lt;ref name="blacksimon"/&gt; Alliances forged between unions and other groups may have a primary identity based on affiliations of [[religion]], [[ethnic group]], [[gender]], [[disability]], [[environmentalism]], [[neighborhood]] residence, or [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].&lt;ref name="10.1093/jeg/lbn011" /&gt;

Community unionism has many definitions and practices.&lt;ref name="ellembrandon"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Contested communities: Geo‐histories of unionism|last = |first = |date = |journal = Journal of Organizational Change Management|volume = 21|issue = 4|pages = 433|doi = 10.1108/09534810810884830|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2008|last1 = Ellem|first1 = Bradon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Coalitions and community unionism|last = |first = |date = |journal = Journal of Organizational Change Management|volume = 21|issue = 4|pages = 415|doi = 10.1108/09534810810884821|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2008|last1 = Tattersall|first1 = Amanda}}&lt;/ref&gt; It varies according to country, institutional and political contexts, internal organization, leadership, scale, organizing style, sources of funding, and communication structure.&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"/&gt; In all, there is no "universal" community union;&lt;ref name="suzukia"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Community Unions in Japan: Similarities and Differences of Region-based Labour Movements between Japan and Other Industrialized Countries|last = |first = |date = |journal = Economic and Industrial Democracy|volume = 29|issue = 4|pages = 492|doi = 10.1177/0143831X08096230|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2008|last1 = Suzuki|first1 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; they take on many different forms.&lt;ref name="ellembrandon"/&gt; In order to simplify the complex structures of community unions, 4 categories have been established (although in practice community unions may blur the boundaries of these classifications):&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"/&gt;

* '''Community organization/ no union partner:'''&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda" /&gt; This consists of community based efforts to organize around workplaces. It may also include new initiatives created by already established community organizations.&lt;ref name="finej"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Community Unions and the Revival of the American Labor Movement|last = |first = |date = |journal = Politics &amp; Society|volume = 33|pages = 153|doi = 10.1177/0032329204272553|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2005|last1 = Fine|first1 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Labour union(s)/ no community partner:'''&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda" /&gt; This category is composed of new union locals or new initiatives undertaken as part of a labour union organizing strategy. These organizations seek the support of community institutions but do not form a joint effort with them.&lt;ref name="finej" /&gt;
* '''Community/labour partnership but with community organization dominant:'''&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda" /&gt; This organization is based on mutual self-interest. Unions and community work together to improve conditions in the labour market through economic and political action. In these partnerships, community leadership dominates the practice of the organization.&lt;ref name="finej" /&gt;
* '''Community/labour partnership but with labour union dominant:'''&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda" /&gt; This organization differs from the one previously mentioned in that union leadership dominates the practice of the organization.&lt;ref name="finej" /&gt;

A part of the discourse of why community unionism has many definitions is in the ambiguity of the word "community" itself.&lt;ref name="ellembrandon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"/&gt; In "Coalitions and Community Unionism", Tattersall breaks the word "community" into three elements which may help in understanding community unions better: as '''organizations''', '''common interest and identity''', and '''place'''.&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"/&gt;

== Goals of community unions ==

Community union initiatives aim to achieve a number of things:

* Seek to build community power.&lt;ref&gt;Cranford, Cynthis J., Ladd, Deena.(2003). Community Unionism:Organizing For Fair Employment In Canada.''Just Labour'',3,46-59.&lt;/ref&gt;
* By increasing scale of organizing activity, they can deal with questions of economic justice beyond particular work places.&lt;ref name="10.1093/jeg/lbn011" /&gt;
* By working with community groups, unions are able to reach workers in traditionally non-union environments.&lt;ref name="10.1093/jeg/lbn011" /&gt;
* They can enable unions to help organize fragmented workforces split across large numbers of small workplaces.&lt;ref name="10.1093/jeg/lbn011" /&gt;
* Establishing extensive links into the local community may help unions defend terms and conditions within their traditional workplaces.&lt;ref name="10.1093/jeg/lbn011" /&gt;

== History of community unionism ==
In ''Community Unionism A Comparative Analysis of Concepts and contexts'', McBride and Greenwood note that community unions are not a new idea: it is an old form of unionism that dates back 150 years. They point out that in the early period of [[trade union]] formation, UK unions were organized within local communities where factories and heavy industry were geographically established. They find that this community/union relationship was broken with the changing geographies of employment and industrial restructuring. With this change, stable communities were destroyed that were located around the docks, mines, mills, and other regions of heavy industry.&lt;ref name="communityunionism"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |last = |first = |date = |journal = |doi = 10.1057/9780230242180|pmid = |access-date = |title = Community Unionism|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-230-24218-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting this idea, Hess also agrees that community factors have always been a part of unionism in "Community as a Factor in Union Organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Community as a factor in union organization|last = |first = |date = |journal = Journal of Organizational Change Management|volume = 21|issue = 4|pages = 497|doi = 10.1108/09534810810884885|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2008|last1 = Hess|first1 = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black establishes that the term “community unionism” was first used in the 1960s in his article “Community Unionism: A Strategy for Organizing in the New Economy”.  He states that James O’Connar used the term in 1964: he believed that in the future, communities would become central to working class organization because of the instability of workplaces. Jones envisioned that future employment would be deskilled and insecure, and because of this, the workplace would no longer be appropriate for organization. He anticipated that community unions would be established in de-industrialized towns, and urban slums. He also believed that community unions would work to improve [[housing]], [[welfare]], and [[public services]].&lt;ref name="blacksimon"/&gt;

As well, Black points out that the notion of community unionism was also used by organizers within the [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW) labour union in the 1960s. An organizer by the name of Jack Conway envisioned a new form of unionism that would develop. Conway too, believed that “community” would take over the central role of the factory in organizing workers in trade unionism. He came to believe this by looking at the Farm Workers Union (FWU). He noticed that the issues that farmers were facing went beyond the workplace. Conway concluded that the new form of unions would focus on grievances, political education, and community organization.&lt;ref name="blacksimon"/&gt;

In "Community Unions in Canada and Labor’s (Re)Organization of Space", Tufts also explains how a labour leader of the UAW, [[Walter Reuther]], envisioned a new form of unionism. Reuther believed that the labour movement should be more of a “[[social movement]]” opposed to an “economic movement”.&lt;ref name="tuftssteven"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Community Unionism in Canada and Labor's (Re)Organization of Space|last = |first = |date = |journal = Antipode|volume = 30|issue = 3|pages = 227|doi = 10.1111/1467-8330.00076|pmid = |access-date = |year = 1998|last1 = Tufts|first1 = Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tattersall points out in her article "Coalitions and Community Unionism:Using the Term Community to Explore Effective Union-Community Collaborations", that "community unions" were also created by the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) in the United States in the 1960s. These community unions were community based, worker organizations.&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"/&gt; Tattersall also notes that along with the UAW, the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s also used the term "community unionism". Here, the term was used to describe community organizations that sought to organize the urban working poor in the United States.&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"/&gt;

Although the notion of community unionism was being put into practice in certain areas, it was not widely accepted by majority of people, and [[business unionism]] dominated.&lt;ref name="tuftssteven"/&gt; It was not until the 1990s that the practice of community unions increased.&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"/&gt;

== The rise of community unions ==
The 1970s and 1980s witnessed profound restructuring of labour markets.&lt;ref name="blacksimon"/&gt; Neoliberal policies that emerged in the 1970s were adopted by many governments around the world, and included measures such as deregulation and privatization. These policies created insecurity in employment by breaking down institutional regulatory and political support for unions. Traditional unions experienced a loss of power, influence, and members.&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"/&gt; During this period of economic restructuring, communities were forced to form [[coalitions]] with the [[labour movement]] to fight factory closures and relocations that were the basis of many local economies.&lt;ref name="tuftssteven"/&gt; Community unionism can be understood as a response to [[neoliberalism]] and [[globalization]]: it was a turn back to the local level-or community- in organizing.&lt;ref name="blacksimon"/&gt; It seeks to organize some of the most vulnerable people- immigrants, women, and people of colour- who have been disproportionately affected by the growth of exploitative working conditions in the neoliberal economy.&lt;ref name="blacksimon"/&gt;

== Community unions in Japan ==

Community unions were formed in Japan in the early 1980s. They emerged spontaneously from [[grassroots]] organizations&lt;ref name="roylet"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = A new form of union organizing in Japan? Community unions and the case of the Mc ''Donald'''s 'Mc ''Union'''|last = |first = |date = |journal = Work, Employment &amp; Society|volume = 26|issue = 4|pages = 606|doi = 10.1177/0950017012445093|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2012|last1 = Royle|first1 = T.|last2 = Urano|first2 = E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from labour councils (although labour councils account for a larger number of organizing activities).&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt; Labour councils that supported community unions were affiliated with [[Sohyo]]: a left leaning union confederation. These labour councils were in charge of different regions and directly represented workers by forming community unions. Labour councils held relative autonomy from the larger national confederation. They were able to achieve this because they maintained their own finances and staff. Thus, community unions were dependent on labour councils for resources that supported these organizations. Because workers with part-time employment were excluded from union membership at those firms, labour councils sought to represent people with part-time employment and people who worked in small firms in a given region. Councils found these workers through “labour problem hotlines”.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt; Because of their independence from the larger confederation, organizing activities varied with each labour council.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;

The range of activities among these labour councils included:

* organizing regional level rallies and demonstrations.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;
* engaging in electoral campaigns during local and national elections.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;
* making policy requests to local governments.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;
* giving support to member unions when they were in a labour dispute.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;
* promoting unionization of un-unionized workers.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;
* getting involved in social movements at the regional level workers.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;

In 1989, Sohyo was replaced with a formation of a new confederation: [[Rengo]]. This restructuring impacted the relationship that labour councils had with community unions:  labour councils would no longer organize workers; they were now a part of Rengo’s Regional Organizations. These Regional Organizations do not have the freedom and activities that labour councils once had and do not support community unions thus some community unions broke up during this time. Community unions that remained faced challenges dealing with finances and autonomy workers.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;

Japanese community unions function differently from US, Canadian, Australian, and UK community unions: their membership turnover is high, and membership rates are low. They are substantially smaller, have a weak financial base-requiring members to donate- and have high [[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]] participation.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt; These community unions take the form of a specific organizational model: '''Community Organization/No Union Partner'''. This framework of community unionism resembles US and Canadian Worker Centers but in practice is quite different. In addition, Japanese community unions do not tend to reflect coalition building like US, Canada, Australia, and UK.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roylet"/&gt; This can be explained by Japan’s lack of community-based organizations able to form [[alliance]]s with community unions, and that Japanese community unions pursue individual issues opposed to broader range of issues that affect livelihoods of many people.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt; Most issues that community unions deal with are: disputes over dismissals, working hours and leave, harassment, demotion or reduction in wages, discrimination, and working conditions. Community unions try to negotiate a settlement for the workers complaint and if it falls through, then are redirected to government labour committees or courts. Once a community union wins a case for a worker, the worker usually gives a part of his/her compensation back to the community union, and then resigns.&lt;ref name="roylet"/&gt;

== Community unions in the US ==

Like other advanced industrial economies, community unionism sprang up in the US in the 1980s. Community unions were formed from community and faith-based organizing networks, Central American solidarity movements and other left wing organizations, legal services and social service agencies, immigrant [[non-governmental organizations]], churches, and [[labour unions]]. US community unions focus on issues that go beyond the workplace such as housing, health care, education, and immigration.&lt;ref name="finej"/&gt;

[[Craft unionism]] in the US organized workers based on their trade by class or skill. The jobs these workers had were stable, paid a [[living wage]], provided pensions, and offered long-term employment. Within the last 20 years, the highly competitive and mobile nature of US firms has resulted in [[outsourcing]] and subcontracting practices. These widespread practices have negative impacts on workers: lower wages, little/no access to benefits, decreased hours, and no pension. Not only are unions being dismantled by neoliberal policies, but the precarious work that has risen out of the US economy no longer identifies with craft union practices as low wage workers are facing different challenges.&lt;ref name="finej"/&gt;  In addition, many jobs that are coming to characterize the US economy are non-unionized.&lt;ref name="finejanice"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = WHY LABOR NEEDS a PLAN B: Alternatives to Conventional Trade Unionism|last = |first = |date = |journal = New Labor Forum|volume = 16|issue = 2|pages = 35|doi = 10.1080/10957960701279181|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2007|last1 = Fine|first1 = Janice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community unionism has been a response to these issues in the US, and has provided activities at a local level that work to set up labour market protections for low wage workers. They accomplish this by organizing members and allies in bringing pressure on elected officials to support them. Thus, US community unions rely on politics and [[public policy]] in creating change for members (wages, hours, working conditions). Community union membership may be based on ethnic, racial, religious affiliations and geographic areas.&lt;ref name="finej"/&gt;&lt;ref name="finejanice"/&gt;

US community unions vary in their organizational framework. They reflect the 4 structures of community unions.&lt;ref name="finej"/&gt; For example:

'''Community organization/ no union partner:''' Worker centers fall into this category.&lt;ref name="finej"/&gt;

'''Labour Union or unions/ no community partner:''' SEIU’s National Justice for Janitors &amp; CHOP Chicago Homecare Organizing Project.&lt;ref name="finej"/&gt;

'''Community/ labour partnership but with community organization dominant:''' Partnership of Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF) and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employers (AFSCME) in Baltimore &amp; The Partnership of Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF) and the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) in Omaha.&lt;ref name="finej"/&gt;

'''Community/labour partnership but with labour union dominant:''' The Stamford Organizing Project of the AFL-CIO.&lt;ref name="finej"/&gt;

== Challenges in community unions ==

In “Community Unionism: A Strategy for Organizing in the New Economy”, Black highlights that community organizations can be territorial. This can lead to conflict when two separate groups try to organize the same community. Black also points out that conflict may also arise over what the focus of their organizing will be based on. Disagreement on the specific goals of the organization can take the form of short-term and long-term goals. Black also finds that there can be conflict on the internal structure of a community union (specifically, equal participation in the organization).&lt;ref name="blacksimon"/&gt;

In “Community Unions in Japan: Similarities Differences of Region Based Labour Movements between Japan and Other Industrialized Countries”, Suzuki finds that challenges arise because of the different ways of looking at community unions: community unions may not fall into a specific category and may bridge different elements of [[coalition]] building and [[social movements]]. For Suzuki, there may be difficulty in forming equal partnerships between unions and organizations, and workers and the unemployed.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;

In ''Community Unionism A Comparative Analysis of Concepts and Contexts'', McBride and Greenwood believe that traditional unions may have problems in giving up their power and control when forming [[alliance]]s with community organizations. Traditional unions are structured hierarchically and operate differently from community organizations which may cause problems. McBride and Greenwood also found that there are no accessible spaces for communities to form relationships with [[trade unions]]. They found that these alliances are formed through formal meetings. This can be a problematic for expanding links into communities as it is a very narrow way of establishing relationships.&lt;ref name="communityunionism"/&gt;

'''Craig Leonard Heatley''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CNZM}} (born 29 May 1956)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Alister Taylor| title=New Zealand Who's Who Aotearoa 2001 Edition| publisher=Alister Taylor Publishers | date=2001 | ISSN=1172-9813 | page= 432}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a New Zealand businessman, entrepreneur and philanthropist. He is one of the wealthiest men in New Zealand according to the New Zealand National Business Review.

==Career==
Heatley set up [[Rainbow Corporation]] in the 1980s which had interests in Woolworths supermarkets, entertainment theme parks and property. Rainbow was acquired by [[Brierley Investments]] in the late 80's to gain control of Rainbows significant stake in Woolworths. Rainbow shareholders agreed to a stock swap deal worth $500 million, of which Heatley controlled 20%. Heatley was appointed to the Brierley board.

He then went on to set up [[Sky Network Television]], Famously with a personal investment of only $1, he managed to turn it into New Zealand's only pay TV provider and one of the 10 largest New Zealand companies, whilst still retaining a 15% stake.

Heatley has since sold his stake in Sky Network Television, and now has diversified interests throughout New Zealand, Asia and the U.S. which include property, infrastructure, equities and aviation. He is also a major player in the New Zealand [[private equity]] and [[currency]] markets.&lt;ref name=richlist&gt;http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/the-rich-list-700m-200m-105943#craig-heatley&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2013 Birthday Honours (New Zealand)|2013 Queen's Birthday Honours]], Heatley was appointed a [[New Zealand Order of Merit|Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit]], for services to business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/publications/queens-birthday-honours-list-2013 |title=Queen's Birthday honours list 2013 |date=3 June 2013 |publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
He was born in [[Lower Hutt]] and educated at [[Heretaunga College]] and the [[Victoria University of Wellington]].

A keen avatior he is one of a very few New Zealanders to own their own private jet, a $30m Bombardier Global.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10500953"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/travellers-tips/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501193&amp;objectid=10500953 |title=Kiwis lead the jet set |author=Phare, Jane |date=30 March 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He owns several properties in New Zealand (including a private island) and the United States.

Heatley is a competitive amateur golfer who won the 2003 [[AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am]] at [[Pebble Beach]] with professional golfer [[Phil Tataurangi]], and the 2004 [[Alfred Dunhill Links Championship]] pro-am with professional golfer [[Fred Couples]].

The '''Financial Market Infrastructure Act''' ('''FMIA'''), original title ''Finanzmarktinfrastrukturgesetz'' ('''FinfraG''') is a body of [[Law of Switzerland|Swiss legislation]] for the regulation of financial markets, in particular [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]]. It was originally adopted by the Swiss [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Federal Assembly]] on June 19, 2015 and came into force on January 1, 2016. 

The objective of the legislation is to reduce [[systemic risk|systemic]] counterparty and operational risk, and help prevent future financial system collapses.  FMIA is intended as the Swiss equivalent to the regulatory packages in the U.S. and the European Union, such as [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd–Frank]] and [[European Market Infrastructure Regulation|EMIR]] / [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004|MiFID]], respectively.

The FMIA regulations include requirements for reporting of derivative contracts and implementation of risk management standards. It also established common rules for central [[counterparty|counterparties]] and [[Trade Repository|trade repositories]]. The implementation of FMIA is overseen by [[Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority|FINMA]].

'''Global Sources Magazines''' are a series of trade magazines designed for businesses importing from [[China]] and [[Asia]]. There are 19 specialized industry-specific titles published by the [[business-to-business]] media company [[Global Sources]] ([[NASDAQ]]-GS: GSOL). All except two titles are published monthly.

Global Sources offers four core services to buyers to facilitate trade – online marketplaces, print and digital magazines, sourcing research reports, and trade shows (''[[China Sourcing Fairs]]'').

==History==

The magazine series originated from the [[export]] trade magazine Asian Sources, which was first published in 1971 by Trade Media Ltd in [[Hong Kong]]. It presented facts, analyzed developments, and anticipated market trends for its readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The First 40 Years of Global Sources.|url=http://www.corporate.globalsources.com/METRICS/40YRS.PDF|year=2010|publisher=Trade Media Ltd|isbn=978-988-19234-7-9|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also featured advertisements of suppliers of Asian-made products.

As trade trends evolved, the editors decided to publish separate titles based on major trade products, starting with Asian Sources Electronics in 1974. Other industry-specific titles were introduced over the years, such as Asian Sources Timepieces, Asian Sources Electronic Components and Asian Sources Computer Products.&lt;ref&gt;Creating Successful Global Trade. Trade Media Ltd. 2006, pp. 28-33&lt;/ref&gt; These magazines provided international market trends and verified business contacts from China and Asia to buyers from Western markets.

The company launched the print magazines on CD-ROMs in 1996 and went online in 2008 with digital versions of the print magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/global-sources/trade-magazines/prweb2141884.htm |title=Global Sources Introduces e-Magazines |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the company’s customer base and span of business expanded globally, a new corporate identity was established in 1998 to reflect this. “Asian Sources” became “Global Sources” and all its publications now carry the new name.

==Content==

Global Sources Magazines has 19 titles, each focusing on a major export industry.

Each issue contains reports on trade news and market trends of the focus industry. The editorial policy advocates objective reporting of export and industry trends in China and Asia.

The magazines also feature detailed profiles of the latest products, along with specifications and photos. All advertisers and featured companies are “verified suppliers” – which indicates that Global Sources has visited or called them and confirmed their business details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsources.com/SITE/QUALITY.HTM |title=Global Sources Quality Commitment |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Readers can contact suppliers directly through advertisements and product/advertiser indexes. Advertisements in magazines are bound by strict advertising standards, and are mostly advised &amp; produced by an in-house creative agency, thus maintaining a level of professionalism.

'''Harold Clifford "Harry" Hatch''' (1884&amp;ndash;1946) was a self-made millionaire industrialist from [[Prince Edward County, Ontario]] specializing in the business of wine and spirits.

Hatch started out with a small liquor store in [[Whitby, Ontario]] and prospered to the point where he was able to purchase the [[controlling interest]] of [[Gooderham and Worts Distillery|Gooderham &amp; Worts Ltd.]] in 1923.  Four years later, Hatch acquired [[Hiram Walker|Hiram Walker &amp; Sons Ltd.]] based in [[Walkerville, Ontario]], and in 1927 merged the two companies under the parent company of Hiram Walker-Gooderham &amp; Worts Limited.  The company was one of a number of Canadian distillers who prospered by shipping their products into the United States during the [[Prohibition]] era from 1920 to 1933.

In 1935, Harry Hatch oversaw Hiram Walker's acquisition of a 51% controlling interest in the [[Corby Distilleries|H. Corby Distillery Limited]]. The following year he expanded the company's operation with the acquisition of [[Ballantine's|George Ballantine &amp; Son Ltd.]] of [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]].

Hiram Walker was best known for marketing top-selling brands such as [[Canadian Club]] whisky and Ballantine's Scotch Whisky.

Hatch was also known for playing a significant role in the pioneering of the [[Canadian wine]] industry, most notably in the [[Niagara Peninsula]] of Southern Ontario, where Hatch became majority owner of [[Brights Wines|T.G. Bright &amp; Co. Limited]] in 1933.  At that time Canadian wineries typically made only ports and sherries, but Hatch pursued the development of a dry table wine and invested company resources into experimenting with different grape varieties not traditionally found in Niagara.

==Thoroughbred horse racing==
In 1927, Harry Hatch bought [[J.K.L. Ross]]'s stable in [[Agincourt, Toronto|Agincourt, Ontario]] and a year later bought [[Sweepster]] from [[Harry F. Sinclair]]'s [[Rancocas Stable]] in [[Jobstown, New Jersey]]. Sweepster became one of the most successful [[Stallion|sire]]s in Canada, siring [[Queen's Plate|King's Plate]] winners [[Monsweep]] and [[Goldlure]]. Harry Hatch became one of the dominant owners and breeders of [[Thoroughbred]]s in Canada during the 1930s and 1940s. Among his many racing successes, in addition to Monsweep and Goldlure, he owned and bred three other King's Plate winners: [[Budpath]], [[Acara (horse)|Acara]], and [[Uttermost]] and owned three winners of the [[Canadian Derby]].

Hatch owned and bred five King’s Plate winners. The light and dark blue silks of his stable were in action throughout the U.S. In 1931 he was among the first Canadians to run a horse in the KentuckyDerby. A horse he imported from Argentina, Filisteo, set an American record in 1941 in the Exterminator Handicap at Pimlico and later sired Plate winner Collisteo. Hatch, who shied from publicity, always sent one of this three sons – Cliff, Doug or Carr – to receive the Plate trophy.
In 2000, Hatch was posthumously inducted into the [[Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame]] as an industry builder.

Harry C. Hatch died on May 8, 1946 at the age of 62.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Harry C. Hatch Dies Ran $8 Into Distilling Empire|last=|first=|date=May 8, 1946|work=The Journal (Ottawa)|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded in the distilling business by his son, [[H. Clifford Hatch]]. Harry Hatch was buried in [[Deseronto, Ontario]], the town where he attended school and first worked (in his father's hotel).

The '''Ifo Business Climate Index''' is a closely followed leading indicator for economic activity in Germany prepared by the [[Ifo Institute for Economic Research]] in [[Munich]], [[Germany]].

== Elements ==

The responses to the survey questionnaire, described below, are evaluated and seasonally adjusted. An index value of 100 corresponds to the survey data as of 1 January 2005. Since January 1991 more than 200 data sets have been published.

Three data series are compiled from the raw survey data:

* business climate
* current business situation
* business outlook

These three components are published as the percentage change over the previous month and as the absolute value with regard to the index reference data, 1 January 2005 = 100. Given the growing importance of the services sector in Germany, Ifo changed the business climate indicator in 2018 to rebase the index and include responses from the services sector in its calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Joern Poltz (April 6, 2018), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-economy-ifo-exclusive/exclusive-ifo-to-change-german-business-climate-index-from-april-to-include-services-idUSKCN1HD1BL Exclusive: Ifo to change German business climate index from April to include services] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the results are depicted in the form of a "business-cycle clock".

== Procedure ==

Every month approximately 7,000 survey participants from firms in manufacturing, construction, wholesaling and retailing are requested to assess their current business situation as well as their business outlook for the coming six months. The Ifo Business Climate has been released monthly by the Ifo Institute since 1972.

=== Questionnaire ===

The firms are queried as to

* their current business situation, with the following choices
** good
** satisfactory
** poor
* their six-month business outlook, with these three choices
** more favorable
** unchanged
** less favorable

=== Evaluation method ===

The balance value of the current business situation is the difference in percentage shares of the responses "good" and "poor"; the balance value of the expectations is the difference in percentage shares of the responses "more favorable" and "less favorable". The business climate is a geometric mean of the balances of the business situation and the business expectations. To calculate the index value, the business climate the transformed balances are normalized to the average of the year 2015&lt;ref&gt;https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/konjunktur/nachrichten/ifo-geschaeftsklimaindex-die-hochstimmung-in-den-deutschen-chefetagen-verfliegt/21206778.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Interpretation ===

As an indicator of economic activity, the Business Climate Index is meant to supplement data from the official statistics, over which it has the advantage of being more frequently compiled and more rapidly accessible (GDP, for example, is only released quarterly and published with a delay of ca. two quarters, with the likelihood of subsequent revisions).

The particular importance of the Ifo Business Climate Index is forecasting turning points in economic growth. A cyclical turning point is reliably indicated following the "three-times rule", that is movement in a particular direction three months in succession.&lt;ref name="Kunkel"&gt;Kunkel, André (2003): [http://www.cesifo.de/pls/guest/download/ifo%20Diskussionsbeitraege/ifodpaper80.pdf Zur Prognosefähigkeit des ifo-Geschäftsklimas und seiner Komponenten sowie die Überprüfung der „Dreimal-Regel“], ifo-Diskussionsbeiträge, Nr.80&lt;/ref&gt;

== Highest and lowest values ==

The Index reached its lowest value in united Germany in March 2009 with 82.2 points. In December 2008 the ''business expectations'' component hit an all-time low of 76.9 points. The lowest level of the second component of the Index, ''business situation'', was at its lowest point in May 2009 with 82.5 points.

The all-time high of the Ifo Index was reached in December 2010 with 109.5 index points, surpassing the previous record high of 108.8 points in December 2006. In March 2006 the surveyed firms gave the best-ever appraisals of the business outlook, with an index value of 105.3.

[[File:National Glass Centre by Heike Brachlow.jpg|thumb|National Glass Centre by Heike Brachlow]]

The '''Institute for International Research in Glass''' (or '''IIRG''') promotes and facilitates research in Glass at a national and international level. It is part of the [[University of Sunderland]], located in the [[National Glass Centre]] on the bank of the river Wear.

==History==
Planning of IIRG began in 1996, spurred on by the "international rating" achieved in the last Research Assessment Exercise, where glass research received a special mention.&lt;ref&gt;Research Assessment Exercise 1996|http://www.rae.ac.uk/1996/1_96/t64.html&lt;/ref&gt; Research funding was won from various sources, and two full-time professorial posts in Glass were created, which were taken up by Dan Klein and Zora Palova. IIRG was launched in June 1998 to compliment the National Glass Centre, which was opened in October of the same year by HRH Prince Charles.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, Flavia (2001) Sunderland Glass Connections: 25 Years of Studio Glass Practice at the University of Sunderland. Exhibition Catalogue, University of Sunderland.&lt;/ref&gt; IIRG was the first research centre of the Art and Design faculty of the University of Sunderland. Professor Sylva Petrova, formerly curator of 20th Century Glass at the Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague and Deputy Director of the museum, became IIRG's first director. When Petrova retired in 2012, she was succeeded by Dr. [[Kevin Petrie]].

==Aims==
*To develop new knowledge relevant to contemporary glass practice, and to explore diverse means of disseminating that information through exhibitions, residencies, master classes, workshops, and publications 
*to provide an interface between high level practice in glass and artists working in other media, students, and the public. 
*To offer a forum for debate and inquiry on contemporary and historical issues in glass. 
*To foster the development of postgraduate research degrees in glass.&lt;ref&gt;http://glassresearch.sunderland.ac.uk/IIRG Website, retrieved 8 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
IIRG researches, publishes, and provides lectures about a wide range of glass topics. It facilitates research of new glass methods and technologies and encourages academic work on contemporary and historical glass.

==Programme==
IIRG regularly organises conferences and seminars about a variety of glass-related topics, including a biannual research conference for ceramics and glass titled ''Parallels and Connections''. It is also involved in activities such as workshops, master classes, publications, exhibitions, residencies, consultancy, project management and commissions.

==Exhibitions==
IIRG has curated various exhibitions in the UK, Czech Republic, Japan, Slovak Republic, Croatia, and Singapore. It is involved in organising research-related exhibitions at the national glass centre, such as ''Wheel and Water grind an Edge'' in 2005 and ''Kith and Kin: New Glass and Ceramics'', a series of two exhibitions in 2012 and 2013.

'''John Wickström''' (until ca. 1889 '''Johannes Wickström'''; 13 December 1870—7 June 1959) was a [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finnish-Swede]] [[engineer]] and [[entrepreneur]].

Wickström was born in [[Kvevlax]], Ostrobothnia. He emigrated to the United States at age of 19 and settled in Chicago, where he studied engineering. Wickström specialised on [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engines]] and founded company for automobile production, but, eventually, his interest focused on [[Inboard motor|boat engines]].

Wickström returned to Finland in 1906 and founded a boat engine factory together with his brother Jakob. The engines became reputable and sales grew until the 1950s, when imported [[outboard engine]]s started to replace the heavy middle engines.

Wickström was married twice.

== Early life ==
Wickström was born as '''Johannes Wickström''' in Vassor village, [[Kvevlax]], Ostrobothnia. His father Johan Wickström was a [[coppersmith]], manufacturer and painter. The family had nine children, the oldest of which died at a young age. He attended primary school in his home village, but, from a young age, he worked in his father's workshop. He was interested at testing and creating; after seeing a picture of a [[bicycle]] on a [[Sweden|Swedish]] newspaper, he built one for himself.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;

== Emigration to America ==
As many other Ostrobothnians at the time, Johannes became interested in emigrating to the United States. After completing his school and [[confirmation]], he borrowed money from his uncle for travelling over the Atlantic and left Finland in 1889. In the United States, he changed his name to John. Typical to [[Finnish Americans|Finnish immigrants]], he became employed in a mine, but, due to his metalworking skills, he soon got a job in a plumbing company, after which he moved to a Chicago engineering company that produced pumps for pumping water inside skyscrapers. The company tested combustion engines, which were still undeveloped. Wickström studied [[mechanical engineering]] in [[North Park College]], Chicago and was awarded some patents related to engines. Wickström's two younger brothers Mickel and Jakob moved to Chicago as well.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;

[[File:Caloric.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Wickström with his family driving his 1898 Caloric car in Chicago in 1899.]]
[[File:Caloric II.JPG|200px|thumb|left|John and Jakob Wickström and 1901 introduced Caloric II.]]
Soon, Wickström focused solely on combustion engines and founded Chicago Motor Cycle Coach Co. for automobile production in 1898. The first car, branded the Caloric, was produced in the same year. Caloric featured a 10–12-[[Horsepower|hp]] [[petrol engine]], and it gained attention on streets of Chicago.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt; The car was further developed and at the early 20th century an upgraded Caloric II was introduced. Reportedly, Caloric was displayed in the first Chicago Automobile Exhibit in 1901.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Immonen |first1=Mari |year=2016 |title=Moottorikuningas John Wickström |trans-title=Engine king John Wickström |journal=Suomen Historia |language=Finnish |location=Vaasa |publisher=Viipalemediat Oy |issue=2./2016 |pages=60–67 |issn=2342-7981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, less than ten Caloric cars are known to be produced.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt;

Wickström kept his focus on boat engine production. He ran the Chicago Caloric Engine Company with his business partners. The company built boat engines and repaired cars in its premises located on Wabash Avenue. The boat engines were used at lakes [[Lake Michigan|Michigan]] and [[Lake Superior|Superior]].&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt; Wickström was involved in a third company called Economy Engine Company.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;

== Return to Finland ==
Wickström had difficulties finding financing for engine development; he had to focus the production on existing, although still profitable, models. By using the property he had collected during his stay in the United States, Wickström believed he would be able to continue development of fishing boat engines in Finland, which was still an untapped market.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;

Upon returning to Finland in 1906, Wickström had to create a market for his engines. Ostrobothnian fishermen, used to propelling themselves by rowing or sailing over many generations, were wary of combustion engines. In order to convince the potential clientele about the benefits of engine power, Wickström arranged an American-style show event in which he tugged two boats loaded with people by a motor boat up along the [[Kyrönjoki]] River. Despite the excessive load, the travelling took less than one third the time compared to rowing. Consequently, Wickström's engines gained a lot of attention and the demand grew high enough that Wickström could start serial production.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;

== Wickström engine production ==
Wickström founded a boat engine factory in [[Palosaari]], [[Vaasa]] together with his brother Jakob who also returned from America; the third emigrated brother Mickel stayed permanently in the United States. The factory was opened in autumn 1906, and, in addition to boat engines, the company produced [[stationary engine]]s for Finnish farmers to power [[Threshing machine|threshers]] and other machinery. Production of Wickström-engines grew over time and, in 1910, the brothers opened a new facility in [[Vaskiluoto]], close to Vaasa harbour. The company name became Bröderna Wickströms Motorfabrik Ab in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and Wickström-Veljesten Moottoritehdas Oy in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ("Wickström Brothers' Engine Works Ltd.").&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt; At the beginning, the brothers produced Caloric engines based on drawings which they had brought with them from America. As the engines turned out to be too complex and unreliable, the company developed modern [[Four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] [[Kerosene|paraffin]] engines, which replaced the older portfolio.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt;

{{Reduced pull quote|right|Perdition will come, if our Lord or Wickström's engine won't help.|Fishermen's saying.|&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt;}}
Wickström engines changed the fishermen's way of living drastically. Due to their higher speed, the fishermen could travel home every evening, instead of bunking in fishing lodges. In 1912, 150 Ostrobothnian fishing boats featured engines. Among Finnish fishermen, Wickström's products reached a reputation of ultimately reliable power units.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt;

[[File:Wickström engine brochure 1933.jpg|200px|thumb|Wickström engine brochure from 1933.]]
After the modest start, demand grew especially after World War I, and the facilities were enlarged several times. In the 1930s, the annual production was about 1,000 units,&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt; and the portfolio consisted of a number of marine and stationary engine models. The company bought production licences for British [[R A Lister and Company|Lister]] diesel engines.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt; At the turn of the 1950s, the headcount reached almost 200, and the company produced thousands of engines per year. By that time, few other engine producers had started production in Vaasa, and the city became the centre of the Finnish small engine production. Wickström was the leading producer of small engines, and any other boat engine brands were an exception in the area.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt; As demand of stationary engines decreased after World War II, the company focused exclusively on boat engines. Wickström engines were exported to Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Japan and Canada.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt;

The Wickström Brothers' Engine Works had a good reputation as an employer, and workers typically made long careers in the factory. Wickström led the company until the end of his life, and he was an appreciated manager.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt; He believed that the robust middle engines, which the company produced, would stay competitive on the market; he considered outboard engines to be rubbish and did not believe in their future. However, as light glass fibre boats pushed aside the heavy wooden boats, American and Swedish produced outboard engines replaced the middle engines over time.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt; After Wickström's death in 1959, the company kept existing for a couple of decades. By then, the Wickström company had lost the spirit of innovation, although the main reason for its decline was the spread of outboard engines and subsequent disappearing of its market.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Wickström married Ida Maria née Östman (1873–1952) in 1892. Their children were Sigrid Ingeborg (b. 1893), Werner Theodor (b. 1897), Roy John Elias (b. 1901) and Alma Ellida (b. 1902). The couple was divorced in 1919;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt; as divorcing was rare and generally not socially accepted at the time, a possible reason could have been rumours about Wickström's illegitimate son in the United States.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt; In the same year, Wickström married Julia Wilhelmina née Bergsten, with whom he had Ingrid Brita Maria (b. 1920) and Johannes Carl-Gustav (b. 1922).&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;

At an early age, Wickström committed to total abstinence from alcohol, and he took part in [[temperance society]] activities.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt; In Chicago, he was a member of the local Swedish–Finnish temperance society (Svensk-Finska Nykterhetsföreningen Topelius), and he was chairman of the Swedish–Finnish Temperance Federation (Svensk-Finska Nykterhetsförbundet).&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt; In Finland, Wickström supported prohibition.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt;

Wickström was a founding member of the Finnish [[Odd Fellows]] fraternity in 1925. He was member of the Vaasa city council.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;

Wickström financed his birth municipality Kvevlax, his former school in Vassor village and craft school Kvevlax Slöjdskola. Many craft school students were inspired by Wickström's example, becoming entrepreneurs themselves.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
The Vaasa City Theatre presented a play about Wickström's life. The performance, written by [[Antti Tuuri]] and directed by [[Erik Kiviniemi]], had its premiere in autumn 2015. [[Jorma Tommila]] starred in the main role.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt;

'''Joseph Hurst Ball''' (November 3, 1905{{spaced ndash}}December 18, 1993) was an American journalist, politician and businessman. Ball served as a Republican senator from Minnesota from 1940 to 1949.  He was a  conservative in domestic policy and a  leading foe of labor unions.  He helped draft the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947.  Ball was best known for his internationalism and his support for a postwar world organization, that became the [[United Nations]].  However, after 1945 he was an opponent of the Marshall Plan.&lt;ref&gt;Eleonora W. Schoenebaum, ed. ''Political Profiles: The Truman Years'' (1978), p. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
== Pre-Senate career ==
Ball was born in [[Crookston, Minnesota|Crookston]], Minnesota, on November 3, 1905, and graduated from high school in 1922.  He financed his education at [[Antioch College]] by planting corn on borrowed land and held jobs during his two years there as a telephone linesman, a construction worker, and a factory employee.  In 1925, he transferred to [[University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire|Eau Claire]] Normal, and then to the [[University of Minnesota]], but never earned a degree.&lt;ref name="CurBio"&gt;''Current Biography 1943'', p. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, he got a reporting job at the ''Minneapolis Journal''.  When he sold a story to a pulp magazine for $50, he quit to become a freelance writer, and spent a year writing paperback fiction before returning to journalism, this time for the ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]''.  In 1934, he became the paper's state political reporter, and befriended assistant county attorney [[Harold Stassen]], a fellow [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].  As a columnist in the ''Pioneer Press'', Ball was critical of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-majority in Congress, but he also opposed [[isolationism]] in foreign policy.  In the meantime, Stassen was elected governor of Minnesota.

== United States Senator ==
When Senator [[Ernest Lundeen]], an isolationist, was killed in a plane crash, Stassen appointed Ball to fill the remaining two years of Lundeen's term.  One of the youngest persons ever to become a U.S. Senator, Ball, at thirty-five, was also the first Senator to be required to register for [[conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;"Young Men, 21-35, Register for Draft Today," ''The Brainerd Daily Dispatch'' (Brainerd, Minnesota), October 16, 1940, p1&lt;/ref&gt;  After being sworn in on October 14, 1940, Ball stunned isolationist Republicans in his first speech on the Senate floor, calling for the United States to aid Britain as "a barrier between us and whatever designs Hitler and his allies may have on this continent."&lt;ref name="CurBio" /&gt;

He opposed the liberalism of the [[New Deal]], but he supported Franklin Roosevelt's foreign policy and supported the [[Lend-Lease]] program on March 8, 1941, in spite of overwhelmingly negative letters from his constituents.  The change in sentiment was best illustrated by the editorial pages of the Fairmont ''Daily Sentinel'', as quoted in an article in ''[[The New Republic]]''.  When he had first been appointed, the ''Sentinel'' ran an editorial with the headline, "Joe Ball for U.S. Senator! Good God!"; upon Ball's re-election, the ''Sentinel'' ran another editorial entitled "Joe Ball for U.S. Senator! Thank God!"&lt;ref name="CurBio" /&gt;

Ball was elected to the Senate in the [[United States Senate elections, 1942|1942 election]], receiving 47% of the vote against Farmer-Labor, Independent and Democratic opposition. Because Ball's 1940 appointment had been set to expire on the day of the next senatorial election rather than the expiration of Lundeen's term, Ball ceased being Senator on the day that he won a six-year term. Ball then took office again, as a freshman senator on January 3, 1943, and served until January 3, 1949. In 1943, he was one of four Senate sponsors of the bill to establish what would become the [[United Nations]].

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1944|1944 U.S. presidential election]], Ball refused to support Republican nominee [[Thomas E. Dewey]], the governor of New York, and instead crossed party lines to endorse Franklin Roosevelt. Ball denounced Dewey for making his position on foreign policy so unclear that both isolationists and internationalists "could find comfort and support in what he said."&lt;ref name="Jordan"&gt;David M. Jordan, ''FDR, Dewey, and the Election of 1944'' (Indiana University Press, 2011), p. 276, {{ISBN|978-0-253-35683-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ball's support for Roosevelt, which may have proved critical to victory in Minnesota, won praise from his senatorial colleague [[Carl Hatch]], a New Mexico Democrat, who said that Ball had "placed his country above his party."&lt;ref name="Jordan" /&gt;

In 1948, Ball was soundly defeated for Senate reelection by [[mayor of Minneapolis|Mayor]] [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] of Minneapolis, a 37-year-old liberal Democrat and [[civil rights]] advocate.

During the 1950s, Ball came to the public defense of several people whom Senator Joseph R. McCarthy accused of having Communist leanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lyons|first1=Richard|title=Joseph H. Ball, 88, Republican Senator And U.N. Advocate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/22/obituaries/joseph-h-ball-88-republican-senator-and-un-advocate.html?module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22%7D|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 22, 1993|accessdate=October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball had never stopped writing his column for the ''Pioneer Press'', even during his service in the United States Senate. He therefore returned to the news business and continued to comment on American foreign policy in a newsletter. He worked as an executive in the shipping industry until he retired in 1982, four years after the death of Hubert Humphrey. Ball died in [[Chevy Chase, Maryland]], at the age of 88.&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Globe'' (Ironwood, Michigan), December 20, 1993, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5342">'''Laisa Digitaki''' is a [[Fiji]]an businesswoman, originally from [[Moala Island]] in the [[Lau Islands|Lau Archipelago]].

==The democracy shrine==
Digitaki came into the public eye in December 2006 when she converted her office building into a pro-[[democracy]] "[[shrine]]" in the wake of the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military coup]] which deposed the elected government of [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]] [[Laisenia Qarase]] on 5 December.

The [[Fiji Sun]] reported on 11 December that the so-called shrine had been demolished by gunmen, whom Digitaki accused of being [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military]] personnel, though she was not present in the office at the time.  Ground floor windows were shattered and a television satellite disk was damaged.

==Great Council of Chiefs protest==
Digitaki and a number of others protesting outside the [[Great Council of Chiefs]] venue in [[Suva]] were arrested by the Military on 21 December 2006, which claimed that she and her companions had no permit for a protest.  The next day, Judge [[John Semisi]] released them on [[bail]] pending a scheduled court appearance on 29 January 2007, [[Fiji Live]] reported.  On 24 December, the [[Fiji Sun]] reported her as saying that she had nothing against the Military Commander and coup leader, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]] personally, but thought he was becoming increasingly unbalanced mentally.

Digitaki failed to appear for the hearing on 29 January.  Her lawyer, [[Tomasi Tuitoga]] told Magistrate [[Aminiasi Katonivualiku]] that she was in hiding and could not appear.  The magistrate accepted that and refused to issue a [[bench warrant]] for her arrest, and adjourned the case to 19 February 2007.

==Christmas detention==
In the very early hours of 25 December, Digitaki and a number of other activists were summoned to [[Suva]]'s [[Queen Elizabeth Barracks, Suva|Queen Elizabeth Barracks]] at [[Nabua]]; she appeared the next day wearing a [[neck brace]] and claimed to have been physically assaulted by soldiers.  She and her colleagues were warned to dismantle the shrine permanently and discontinue attacking the Military regime, or else there would be further trouble. When she arrived home (after having been forced to run from [[Suva]] to [[Lami, Fiji|Lami]]) in the early hours of Christmas morning, [[Fiji Television]] reported that she found it ransacked, with documents strewn everywhere.  The Military, meanwhile, said it would conduct its own investigation into the alleged abuse.

[[Fiji Village]] quoted her as saying on 27 December that she had decided to forgive Commodore Bainimarama for the injuries she had suffered at the hands of his troops.

On 28 December, Elizabeth Clayton, an [[Australia]]n to whom Digitaki and her husband loaned $50,000 to save her CHE furniture manufacturing business, questioned her motives for opposing the Military regime.

Military authorities directed Immigration Department on 28 December 2006 to prevent Digitaki and several other activists from leaving Fiji. On 30 December, when she attempted to board a flight to [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] at 9am at [[Nadi International Airport]], she was stopped, according to [[Fiji Television]]. Her two teenage children were allowed to depart, however, but her youngest daughter, according to a [[Fiji Television]] report, was sent home with her mother.

==Under United Nations protection==
The Military announced on 25 January that it was searching for Digitaki and fellow-activist [[Angie Heffernan]] for "inciteful" comments they had allegedly made. [[Fiji Live]] quoted what it called "a reliable source" as saying that the Military was angry about allegations Digitaki had made in a statement posted in the [[Fiji Village]] forum on 17 January, detailing her treatment during her interrogation at the barracks on 25 December. According to the unnamed source, the Military was annoyed that [[Pita Driti]], the [[Land Force Commander (Fiji)|Land Force Commander]], had been named in the statement, and the Military had contacted her on 23 January.  Digitaki was reported to have fled her home and gone into hiding. Soldiers in civilian clothes were patrolling her home in [[Muanikau]], [[Suva]].

Digitaki announced on 26 January that she had requested, and received, the protection of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] in Fiji. She claimed to be dealing with the headquarters in [[Geneva]] directly, and to have been instructed not to divulge further details.

The police announced on 28 January that they had begun an investigation into Digitaki and Heffernan on the basis of a formal complaint from the Military.

==Personal life==
Digitaki is married to prominent businessman [[Sitiveni Weleilakeba]].  She has a son, '''Mosese Qionibaravi''' (born 1987), two daughters, '''Susana Qionibaravi''' (born 1989) and '''Natasha Weleilakeba''' (born 1998), and one stepdaughter '''Fiona Weleilakeba''' (born 1993). Digitaki once lived in Australia but moved back to Fiji when she had married Weleilakeba.

'''Sir Hugh Lancelot (Lance) Brisbane''' (16 March 1893 – 4 February 1966) was a prominent Western Australian [[industrialist]] and businessman.&lt;ref name=" Bryce Moore "&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130711b.htm
|title= Biographical Entry |work= [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Brisbane was born in [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], Melbourne, the son of an [[ironmonger]]. The family moved to WA the year after his birth, and he attended [[Fremantle Boys' School]] and [[Old Perth Technical School|Perth Technical School]].&lt;ref name=" Bryce Moore "/&gt;

== Career ==
In 1909 he started a [[technical writing|draughtsman]] [[apprenticeship]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] with Wunderlich Ltd, a building materials company. His career was interrupted by World War I: in 1915 he enlisted in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|AIF]]. He served in the Middle East in Australian and British units, was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] and awarded the Egyptian [[Order of the Nile]]. After a promotion to temporary major in February 1919 he returned home where his army appointment terminated on 14 October.&lt;ref name="Bryce Moore" /&gt;

==Business life==
In 1927 entrepreneur [[Reginald Long]] bought a controlling interest in [[Westralian Potteries Ltd]] and recruited Brisbane as [[general manager]] in 1929. Despite Brisbane not being a major [[shareholder]], the company’s name was changed to H. L. Brisbane &amp; Co. Ltd. Despite the [[Great Depression]], he expanded the company until it challenged Brisbane’s former employer Wunderlich as market leader. In 1938 Wunderlich merged its Western Australian operation with H. L. Brisbane on condition Brisbane wouldn’t expand his business interstate. H. L. Brisbane &amp; Wunderlich Ltd became the state's largest [[clay]] tile producer and enjoyed a virtual monopoly in the industry. Over the next 28 years Brisbane built the firm into a large and diversified manufacturing enterprise: it made [[stainless steel]] products, clay sewer-pipes, [[porcelain]], refractory [[brick]]s, [[aluminium]] fabrication, building [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]] and plastics.&lt;ref name="Bryce Moore" /&gt; It sold to Australian Fine China in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=" Australia Wide "&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abc.net.au/tv/australiawide/stories/s1626172.htm |title= Wembley Ware |work= Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"An [[industrialist]] of the old school, with a thoroughgoing knowledge of all aspects of the business, he placed great importance on the loyalty and enthusiasm of his employees; his paternalistic management and manner of handling [[industrial relations]] had been largely responsible for his firm's survival through the Depression."&lt;ref name="Bryce Moore" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Interests==
Brisbane was an enthusiastic promoter of industrial development. He was [[knight]]ed in 1961, and appointed by the Brand state government to its Industries Advisory Committee, a body composed of leading businessmen. He also worked for the [[National Heart Foundation of Australia]] and the [[Princess Margaret Hospital for Children]].&lt;ref name="Bryce Moore" /&gt;

==Wembley Ware==
In 1946 Brisbane and Wunderlich created a range of decorative crockery called Wembley Ware. The range was Brisbane’s brainchild. The first product was the Cruet Set. To avoid paying a high sales tax the piece was fashioned into a salt and pepper shaker and a mustard dish. It was extremely popular, and hundreds more pieces of functional fancy tableware and other items followed, such as ashtrays in unusual shapes.&lt;ref name=" Australia Wide "/&gt;

==The Old Mill==
In 1957 there was a confrontation between the state government and conservationists when it was discovered the ruins of Shenton’s Mill lay in the path of the proposed [[Narrows Bridge (Perth)|Narrows Bridge]] and Freeway. After a win for the conservationists, the State Government ordered a change in the Freeway Route, and Brisbane funded the reconstruction and upgrading of the Mill as a folk museum.&lt;ref name=" The Old Mill "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southperth.wa.gov.au/community_facilities/library/oldmill.htm |title=The Old Mill |work=South Perth Library |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626094233/http://www.southperth.wa.gov.au/community_facilities/library/oldmill.htm |archivedate=26 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Brisbane married Frances Leonard Hoyle on 21 September 1921 at St Mary's Anglican Church, [[West Perth, Western Australia|West Perth]]: they had two daughters. He died in [[Bethesda Hospital, Perth|Bethesda Hospital]], [[Claremont, Western Australia|Claremont]] and was [[cremated]]. His [[estate (law)|estate]] was worth $178,442.&lt;ref name="Bryce Moore" /&gt;

'''''Listen Money Matters''''' is an American personal finance website and weekly podcast created by Andrew Fiebert in December 2012. The podcast describes itself as "honest and uncensored" and emphasizes a relatable, informal tone.&lt;ref name=Q&gt;Banjo, Shelly. [http://qz.com/410627/this-rap-video-about-your-money-is-actually-pretty-cool/ "Rap music is full of bad financial advice—but not in this video."]  ''Quartz''. May 24, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/listen-money-matters!-personal/id736826307?mt=2 Listen Money Matters]". iTunes. Undated. Accessed April 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Giovanisci served as co-host until 2015, when he was replaced by Thomas Frank. Since the podcast's debut, the brand has expanded to include a community forum, book club, and a 2014 book, ''Mastering Mint''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/ Listen Money Matters home page]. Listen Money Matters. Undated. Accessed April 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
''Listen Money Matters'' was founded in December 2012 by Andrew Fiebert. Fiebert had been displaced by [[Hurricane Sandy]] and was reconsidering his personal finances, and future co-host Matt Giovanisci, who at the time was heavily in debt, had turned to Fiebert for financial advice.&lt;ref name=Q/&gt;&lt;ref name=CN /&gt;  Giovanisci says that he and Fiebert sought to create a podcast that "wasn’t just two boring white dudes on the Internet spouting off about how they should be investing in Vanguard mutual funds... The idea was to be fun, joke, curse, drink, and just be real people who happen to be sneaking in some personal finance information".&lt;ref name=Q/&gt;  

''[[Business Insider]]'' named ''Listen Money Matters'' one of their "11 podcasts to listen to if you want to get rich", writing that "This lively show... will keep you alert and laughing. The hosts offer actionable personal finance advice, and deliver it in a very raw and honest tone."&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, Kathleen. "[http://www.businessinsider.com/podcasts-about-money-2015-6 11 podcasts to listen to if you want to get rich]." ''Business Insider''. June 23, 2015.&lt;/Ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' has described the podcast as a "hit" that "has millennials all over America listening".&lt;ref name=F1&gt;Talty, Alexandra. "[https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandratalty/2015/01/13/how-to-invest-your-first-5000/#6993a7d75dfe How To Invest Your First $5,000]." ''Forbes''. January 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=F2&gt;Talty, Alexandra. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandratalty/2015/02/17/detox-your-daily-spending-before-fun-filled-summer/#1a938f6c5ffe  "Detox Your Daily Spending Before Fun-Filled Summer"]. ''Forbes''.  February 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Instavest named Listen Money Matters as one of the "Six Best Personal Finance Podcasters on the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://blog.instavest.com/top-5-personal-finance-podcasters Six Best Personal Finance Podcasters on the Internet]". ''Instavest''. November 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Fiebert and Giovanisci released a book, ''Mastering Mint'', advising investors on how to manage their finances with the service [[Mint.com]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Thomas. "[http://collegeinfogeek.com/listen-money-matters/ Mastering Your Money With Matt And Andrew of Listen Money Matters]". ''College Info Geek''. May 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Listen Money Matters produced a rap video about personal finance titled "All My Money".&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Lauren. "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/11630012/Forget-Jay-Z-and-Kanye...-this-rap-song-has-real-financial-advice.html  Forget Jay Z and Kanye... this rap song has real financial advice]". ''The Telegraph''. May 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Quartz'' wrote of the video that "it’s rare to come across something [in financial discussions] as fun—and actually educational—as this rap video".&lt;ref name=Q/&gt;

==Founders==
Andrew Fiebert took a job as a data engineer at an investment bank following college. After [[Hurricane Sandy]] struck the Eastern United States in October 2012, he was forced to move back in with his parents. The experience caused him to reconsider his finances, and his wife suggested that he put his thoughts into a podcast. He describes himself as ''Listen Money Matters''' "Chief Nerd".&lt;ref name=CN&gt;"[https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/team/andrew-fiebert/ Andrew Fiebert: Chief Nerd]." Listen Money Matters. Undated. Accessed April 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Matt Giovanisci left the podcast in 2015 to concentrate on his Swim University brand, which produces a podcast and other material on pool and hot tub maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.swimuniversity.com/about/ Making Pool and Hot Tub Care Easy]". Swim University. Undated. Accessed April 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced on the podcast by Thomas Frank of College Info Geek.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/team/thomas-frank/ Thomas Frank: College and Habit Master]". Listen Money Matters. Undated. Accessed April 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stalter, Kate. "[http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/mutual-funds/articles/2015/02/23/how-one-recent-college-grad-intends-to-retire-at-40 How One Recent College Grad Intends to Retire at 40]. ''U.S. News &amp; World Report''. February 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the podcast's July 23, 2018 episode, Frank announced that he would be stepping down and that Giovanisci would return as co-host.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1691">In [[industrial organization]], the '''minimum efficient scale''' ('''MES''') or '''efficient scale of production''' is the lowest point where the plant (or firm) can produce such that its [[long run average cost]]s are minimized. 

==Relationship to average cost and marginal cost==
The minimum efficient scale can be computed by equating [[average cost]] (AC) with [[marginal cost]] (MC). The rationale behind this is that if a firm were to produce a small number of units, its average cost per unit would be high because the bulk of the costs would come from [[fixed cost]]s. But if the firm produces more units, the average cost incurred per unit will be lower as the fixed costs are spread over a larger number of units; the marginal cost is below the average cost, pulling the latter down. The efficient scale of production is then reached when the average cost is at its minimum and therefore the same as the marginal cost.

==Relationship to market structure==
The concept of minimum efficient scale is useful in determining the likely [[market structure]] of a market. For instance, if the minimum efficient scale is small relative to the overall size of the market (demand for the good), there will be a large number of firms. The firms in this market will be likely to behave in a [[Perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] manner due to the large number of competitors.&lt;ref&gt;Carlton D. and Perloff M.: "Modern Industrial Organization" Fourth Edition, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[finance]], "participation"  is an ownership [[interest]] in a [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] or other [[loan]]. In particular, '''loan participation''' is a cooperation of multiple lenders to issue a loan (known as '''participation loan''') to one borrower. This is usually done in order to reduce individual [[risk]]s of the lenders.

The term is also used as a synonym to '''profit sharing''', an [[incentive]] whereby employees of a company receive a share of the profits of the company.

In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Finland)|2009 European Parliament election]], Penttilä was one of the most popular candidates in Finland. His result 50,858 was short by a margin of several hundred votes and gave him the first deputy candidacy.

==Education==
* Doctor of Philosophy (International Relations), [[University College, Oxford]] 1989
* Master of Philosophy, University College, Oxford 1986
* Bachelor of Arts, Saybrook College, [[Yale University]] 1984

Penttilä was the first Finn to receive a Bachelor's degree from Yale. At University College, Oxford, he lived in the same room as [[Bill Clinton]] before him and [[Chelsea Clinton]] after him.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Career==

Penttilä was the CEO of Finland Chamber of Commerce from 2010-2017. He has also worked for [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]], the [[World Economic Forum]] and [[Oxford Analytica]]. He has been a columnist in the [[International Herald Tribune]], the [[Financial Times]], and [[Taloussanomat]]. He won the [[Finnish Cup]] football championship in the [[Lahden Reipas]] team in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://suomencup.net/index.php?title=Finaali_(Suomen_Cup_1978)|title=Suomen Cupin finaalissa 1978|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Yale, Penttilä was selected to the [[Ivy league]] football team.

In 1994, he and several other people founded the [[Nuorsuomalaiset]], a reform-oriented liberal political party. He was elected to the parliament in the 1995 elections. The party failed in the 1999 elections and was discontinued.

In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Finland)|2009 European Parliament election]], he was a [[National Coalition Party]] candidate. Penttilä was endorsed by people such as former socialist leader [[Suvi-Anne Siimes]], business leader [[Björn Wahlroos]], ice-hockey coach [[Juhani Tamminen]], and Finnish design leader [[Lenita Airisto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pohjalainen.fi/Article.jsp?article=419542&amp;Title=Juhani+Tamminen+ja+Suvi-Anne+Siimes+kannattavat+samaa+EU-ehdokasta Juhani Tamminen ja Suvi-Anne Siimes kannattavat samaa EU-ehdokasta]. Pohjalainen&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the most popular candidates, receiving 50,858 votes and the first deputy seat.

Penttilä has proposed English as an official "auxiliary language" in Finland. He has said: "A separate statute would specify for those foreigners who are living here - and those foreigners and companies who are moving to Finland - such areas, for instance of public administration, services, and taxation, in which documentation would also be printed and made available in English".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/EVAs+Risto+Penttilä+proposes+English+as+an+official+auxiliary+language/1101977891730 EVA's Risto Penttilä proposes English as an official "auxiliary language"]. Helsingin Sanomat&lt;/ref&gt; Penttilä has encouraged open discussion about pension reform in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/kotimaa.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2009/03/830824 EVA:n johtaja haastaa ennakkoluulottomaan keskusteluun eläkeiästä].

Drury attended [[Napier Boys' High School]], where he developed an interest in computer programming.&lt;ref name="november2017" /&gt; He went on to study commerce and administration at [[Victoria University of Wellington]]. After university, he worked at the accounting firm Arthur Young, which became [[Ernst &amp; Young]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==
In 1995, Drury established [[Glazier Systems]], a New Zealand software development and consulting company.

In October 2007, Drury was a judge for the [[New Zealand Open Source Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nzosa.org.nz/judges | title=New Zealand Open Source Awards |date=2007-10-17| accessdate=2008-05-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080509130322/http://www.nzosa.org.nz/judges |archivedate = 2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drury co-founded Pacific Fibre, a company which attempted to build an internet cable between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/4521214/Pacific-Fibre-adds-Facebook-and-Paypal | title=Pacific Fibre adds Facebook and Paypal | work=Stuff.co.nz | date=8 January 2011 | accessdate=4 May 2015 | author=McBeth, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cable would have cost around $400 million but the venture was ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10824153 | title=Politics helped kill cable | publisher=NZME | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=3 August 2012 | accessdate=4 May 2015 | author=Fletcher, Hamish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, he sold $95 million worth of shares in Xero, leaving him with a 13 per cent holding in the company. He stated the sale would support his "future plans to pursue a range of philanthropic and social endeavours." He stepped down as CEO of Xero in March 2018, continuing on with the company as a non-executive director.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/101976251/rod-drury-stands-down-as-ceo-of-xero Rod Drury stands down as CEO of Xero, replaced by Aussie]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8863">'''Rule-developing experimentation''' or  '''RDE''' is a systematized solution-oriented business process of experimentation that designs, tests, and modifies alternative ideas, packages, products, or services in a disciplined way using [[experimental design]], so that the developer and marketer discover what appeals to the customer, even if the customer can't articulate the need, much less the solution.

== Explanation ==
Rule-developing experimentation was developed by Moskowitz Jacobs Inc. in cooperation with [[Jerry Wind|Professor Jerry (Yoram) Wind]] ([[Wharton School of Business]] at [[University of Pennsylvania]]). The term was initially coined by [http://sellingblueelephants.com/About_us.html Howard R. Moskowitz] and [http://www.alexgofman.com Alex Gofman] in a series of articles and conference papers.&lt;ref&gt; Knowledge at Wharton: Using Rule Developing Experimentation (RDE) to Determine Consumer Preferences (2007). (http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=696624)&lt;/ref&gt; The paradigm for systematic design and developing/using the rules in various applications was formalized in their book ''[[Selling Blue Elephants: How to Make Great Products That People Want Before They Even Know They Want Them]]'' ([[Wharton School Publishing]], 2007).&lt;ref name=Moskowitz&gt;Moskowitz, H. and Gofman, A. (2007). Selling Blue Elephants: How to Make Great Products That People Want Before They Even Know They Want Them. Wharton School Publishing. Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some aspects of RDE have previously been used during the past 25 years for the design and optimization of physical products, product development concepts, [[marketing]] communications, as well as packaging. Beginning in 1982, RDE was variously described in different books and articles by a number of different terms (e.g., product optimization), depending on the product area and the topics (e.g.&lt;ref&gt; Moskowitz, H. (1985). New Direction in Product Testing and Optimization.  Food and Nutrition Press, Inc., Westport.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moskowitz, H. (1994). Food Concepts and Products:  Just-in-Time Development, Food and Nutrition Press, Trumbull.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moskowitz, H. (1984). Cosmetic Product Testing:  A Modern Psychophysical Approach, Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moskowitz, H. R., Porretta, S., Silcher, M. (2005). Concept research in food product Design and Development, Iowa, Blackwell Professional.&lt;/ref&gt;). RDE has been effectively utilized over the years by many of [[Fortune 500]] companies around the world.

== Areas of application ==
Initially, RDE was used for product optimization followed by message optimization for [[advertising]], promotions, etc. New applications of RDE include NDP "NDP is not defined. Could it be a typo for [[new product development]] (NPD)?&lt;ref&gt;as in http://www.1000ventures.com/business_guide/new_product_development.html ?"&lt;/ref&gt; combinatorial innovation, multivariate [[landing page optimization]] ([[MVLPO]]),&lt;ref&gt; Gofman, A. Improving the 'Stickiness' of Your Website. Financial Times Press. Sept. 21, 2007. (http://www.ftpress.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1015178)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; political elections, stock markets, crisis communications management, package design, magazine cover, flyer optimization, social science, public policies, etc. – virtually any field that involves people decisions and choices, emotional perceptions of messages and other stimuli. RDE is the foundation for the new science of MindGenomics modeled on the emerging science of genomics and the technology of informatics.&lt;ref&gt;Moskowitz, H., Gofman, A., Beckley, J., Ashman, H. (2006). Founding A New Science: Mind Genomics. Journal of Sensory Studies, 2006, issue 21:3 article 66, pp. 266-307.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The three roots ==

# '''Experimental psychology''' – RDE is founded on the realization that perception and behavior are linked in a two-way exchange. RDE uses a variation of [[conjoint analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;Green, P. and Srinivasan, V. (1978) Conjoint analysis in consumer research: Issues and outlook, Journal of Consumer Research, vol 5, September 1978, pp 103-123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, P. Carroll, J. and Goldberg, S. (1981) A general approach to product design optimization via conjoint analysis, Journal of Marketing, vol. 43, summer 1981, pp 17-35.&lt;/ref&gt; as its statistical basis. 
# '''Driving power of business''' – a need to create new products and services that people like, doing so fast and inexpensively 
# '''The world-view of social science''' – RDE is related to a field called adaptive experimentation (AE), or [[adaptive management]]. The most publicized cases of AE are very lengthy, large-scale, even monumental projects in ecology, theoretical science, or the sociology/environmental area. However, AE doesn’t generate rules.

== The seven basic steps ==

'''Step 1.''' Identify groups or classes of features that constitute the target product (offering, etc.) For example, in the case of a credit card offer, the variables could be APRs (annual percentage rates), Rewards Options, and so on. Every such variable (also called a 'silo' or a 'bucket' of ideas) comprises several APRs, Rewards Options, etc. 

'''Step 2.''' Mix and match the elements according to an experimental design to create a set of prototypes. The second step is usually done automatically by a tool that creates a unique individual design plan for each respondent, allowing for individual models of utilities for each respondent.

'''Step 3.''' Show the prototypes to consumers and collect their responses on a rating question (e.g., "How likely would you be to buy this product?").

'''Step 4.''' Analyze results using a regression module. One of the key differentiating points of RDE is individual models of utilities for each respondent. This allows patterns discovered in the data, across elements and respondents (Step 6) to generate rules for more targeted optimization as well as uncover all meaningful two-way synergisms and suppressions between the elements.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz2004"&gt;Moskowitz, H.R., Gofman, A. (2004). A System and Method for Performing Conjoint Analysis. Patent Pending. Based on U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/538,787&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gofman&gt;Gofman, A. (2006). Emergent Scenarios, Synergies, And Suppressions Uncovered Within Conjoint Analysis. Journal of Sensory Studies, 2006, issue 21:4 article 72, pp. 373-414.&lt;/ref&gt; RDE uses dummy variable regression to estimate the absolute values of the utilities, which in turn allows for databasing the results. The database makes for meaningful comparison of the element utilities in one study, and across studies, which then track the consumers' minds across studies and time.

'''Step 5.''' Optimize. Uncover the optimal product, find the best combination that has the highest sum of utilities.

'''Step 6.''' Identify naturally occurring attitudinal segments of the population that show similar patterns of the utilities. 

'''Step 7.''' Apply the generated rules to create new products, services, offerings, and so on. 

== Key advantages ==
* The structure of RDE imposes the discipline of thinking resulting in a higher success rate than other methods. Many users report that just preparing for RDE (seven steps above) helps them to better understand the problem and find possible solutions.&lt;ref name=Moskowitz/&gt;
* Individual models for each respondent allows for more robust and rich data to generate rules. Some advantages of individual models include:
** Pattern-based discoveries (Step 6, segmentation) to generate rules for more targeted optimization (also called attitudinal segmentation or latent segments)
** Simulate market share and choice analysis
** Discover any and all meaningful pair-wise interactions between the elements&lt;ref name="Moskowitz2004"/&gt;
** Analyze how one element 'drives' responses to another element using scenarios (e.g., in case of a category containing brands names, the researcher can compare the utilities of other elements when each of the brands are kept constant).&lt;ref name=Gofman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gofman A. (2010). Systematic Consumer-Driven Innovation in Mature Food Categories: Applications of Rule Developing Experimentation. Saarbrücken, Germany: LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing. &lt;/ref&gt;
* RDE uses a variation of dummy variable regression to estimate the absolute values of the utilities, which in turn allows databasing the result for tracking the consumers' minds and easy comparison of the utilities across the categories.

The '''school leaving age''' is the minimum age a person is legally allowed to cease attendance at an institute of [[compulsory education|compulsory]] [[secondary education]]. Most countries have their school leaving age set the same as their minimum full-time employment age, thus allowing smooth transition from education into employment, whilst a few have it set just below the age at which a person is allowed to be employed.

In contrast, there are numerous countries that have several years between their school leaving age and their legal minimum employment age, thus in some cases preventing any such transition for several years. Countries which have their employment age set below the school leaving age of 5 years old but  (mostly developing countries), risk giving children the opportunity to leave their education early to earn money for their families.

==Leaving age by country==
Some countries have different leaving or employment ages, but in certain countries like China and Japan, the average age at which people graduate is 15, depending upon part-time or full-time learning or employment. The table below states the school leaving ages in countries across the world and their respective minimum employment age, showing a comparison of how many countries have synchronised these ages. All information is taken from the Right to Education Project's table unless otherwise indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.right-to-education.org/node/279 |title=Country Table - At What Age?...are school-children employed, married and taken to court|publisher=The Right to Education Project|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, all children between those ages, even if they're refugees or new, have to attend school.
Not attending school with-out proper reason for example; sickness or a doctors visit, is illegal and is seen as wagging which is seen as fraud and punishable by law. Until the age of 12 children cannot be punished by law, but as soon as your child or you turn 12 years of age or older, you can be held responsible for wagging.
Punishments can be done as a fine, temporary jail time or a community service job done under supervision. Fines can be up to € 3 900 00.

According to the [[AIAA]] Space Logistics Technical Committee, '''space logistics''' is

:... the theory and practice of driving space system design for operability, and of managing the flow of material, services, and information needed throughout a space system lifecycle.&lt;ref name=aiaa_sltc_def&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 2011-09-28}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this definition in its larger sense includes terrestrial logistics in support of space travel, including any additional "design and development, acquisition, storage, movement, distribution, maintenance, evacuation, and disposition of space materiel", movement of people in space (both routine and for medical and other emergencies), and contracting and supplying any required support services for maintaining space travel.&lt;ref name=aiaa_sltc_def/&gt;

[[Wernher von Braun]] spoke of the necessity (and the underdevelopment) of space logistics as early as 1960:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video

:"We have a logistics problem coming up in space ... that will challenge the thinking of the most visionary logistics engineers. As you know, we are currently investigating three regions of space: near-Earth, the lunar region, and the planets. While it is safe to say that all of us have undoubtedly been aware of many or most of the logistics requirements and problems in the discussion, at least in a general way, I think it is also safe to state that many of us have not realized the enormous scope of the tasks performed in the logistics area. I hope the discussions bring about a better understanding of the fact that logistics support is a major portion of most large development projects. Logistics support, in fact, is a major cause of the success or failure of many undertakings."

:The United States space exploration goals expressed in January 2004 call for the retirement of the [[Space Shuttle program]] following completion of [[International Space Station]] (ISS) construction. Since the Shuttle is instrumental in transporting large quantities of cargo to and from the ISS, this functional capability must be preserved to ensure ongoing station operations in a post-Shuttle era. Fulfilling ongoing cargo transport requirements to the ISS is a prime opportunity for NASA to reduce costs and preserve and repurpose the unique and limited Shuttle resource by acquiring cargo transportation services commercially. Further, implementing such a service prior to retirement of the Shuttle reduces risk to the vehicle and her crews by eliminating their use for routine cargo transport missions while accelerating the readiness for alternative ISS-support transportation.

:In January 2004, President Bush directed NASA to begin an initiative that focuses on exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond. This initiative calls for the completion of International Space Station (ISS) assembly by the end of the decade coincident with retirement of the Space Shuttle.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Bush, A Renewed Spirit of Discovery: The Presidents Vision for U.S. Space Exploration, January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Retirement of the Shuttle while ISS operations are still being conducted results in reduced capability to supply ISS logistics requirements. An examination of existing and planned logistics carriers shows that there are deficiencies in both capacity and capability to support ISS needs. [[SPACEHAB]]'s history of space station logistics delivery and existing ground infrastructure coupled with NASA's mandate and documented intent to acquire commercial space systems and services when possible has led SPACEHAB to develop a versatile and affordable cargo transport service for ISS .&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress, National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended, Public Law 85-568, 1984.

:NASA has awarded $3.8 million to two MIT engineering professors to pursue an interdisciplinary study for adapting [[supply chain]] logistics to support interplanetary material transport and transfer. Professors David Simchi-Levi and Olivier de Weck of the [[List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty|MIT Engineering Systems Division]] will spearhead the project in partnership with the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], [[Payload Systems]], and [[United Space Alliance]].
:Sustainable space exploration is impossible without appropriate supply chain management and unlike Apollo, future exploration will have to rely on a complex supply network on the ground and in space. The primary goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive supply chain management framework and planning tool for space logistics. The eventual integrated space logistics framework will encompass terrestrial movement of material and information, transfer to [[launch site]]s, integration of payload onto launch vehicles and launch to [[Low Earth Orbit]], in-space and planetary transfer, and planetary surface logistics. The MIT-led interplanetary supply chain management model will take a four-phase development approach:
:1. Review of supply chain management lessons learned from Earth-based commercial and military projects, including naval submarine and arctic logistics
:2. Space logistics network analyses based on modeling Earth-Moon-Mars orbits and expected landing-exploration sites
:3. Demand/supply modeling that embraces uncertainty in demand, cargo mix, costs, and supply chain disruptions
:4. Development of an interplanetary supply chain architecture.

==State of the ISS logistics capability in 2005==
A snapshot of the logistics of a single space facility, the International Space Station, was provided in 2005 via a comprehensive study done by James Baker and Frank Eichstadt.&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;  This article section makes extensive reference to that study.

===ISS cargo requirements===
{{asof|2004}}, the [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] [[Space Shuttle]], the [[Russia]]n [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]], and to a very limited extent, the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] vehicles were the only [[space transport]] systems capable of transporting ISS cargo.&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;

However, in 2004, it was already anticipated that the European [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] (ATV) and Japanese [[H-II Transfer Vehicle|H-IIA Transfer Vehicle]] (HTV) would be introduced into service before the end of [[Assembly of the International Space Station|ISS Assembly]]. As of 2004, the US Shuttle transported the majority of the pressurized and unpressurized cargo and provides virtually all of the recoverable [[downmass|down mass]] capability (the capability of non-destructive reentry of cargo).&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;{{update after|2012|12|27}}

===Cargo vehicle capabilities===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:An understanding of the future ISS cargo requirements is necessary to size a commercial cargo vehicle designed to replace the Shuttle's capabilities and capacities and augment currently planned alternative vehicles. Accurate estimates of ISS cargo transfer requirements are difficult to establish due to ongoing changes in logistics requirements, crew tending levels, vehicle availabilities, and the evolving role the ISS will play in NASA's space exploration and research goals.
:An increased unpressurized cargo delivery requirement is shown during the years 2007–2010. This increased rate is a result of a current plan to preposition unpressurized spares on the ISS prior to Shuttle retirement. Provision of a commercial cargo carrier capable of transporting unpressurized spares to supplement the Shuttle eliminates the prepositioning requirement and aligns the estimated averages during 2007–2010 to approximately 24,000&amp;nbsp;kg for pressurized cargo and 6800&amp;nbsp;kg for unpressurized cargo. Considering the delivery capability of the remaining systems after the Shuttle is retired yields.
:Retirement of the Shuttle and reliance on the Progress, ATV, and HTV for ISS logistics will result in no significant recoverable down-mass capability. Further, no evidence suggests that any of these cargo transport systems can increase production and launch rates to cover the cargo delivery deficiency.

===Commercial opportunity===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:In addition to ISS support deficiencies, alternative opportunities for a commercial cargo transport system exist. The retirement of the Shuttle will also result in an inability to conduct Low Earth Orbit (LEO) research independent of the ISS. A commercial payload service could serve as a free-flying research platform to fulfill this need. As logistics support requirements for NASA's space exploration initiative emerge, existing commercial system can be employed.

:Finally, nascent interest in the development of non-government commercial space stations must take resupply issues into consideration. Such considerations will undoubtedly be subjected to a make/buy analysis. Existing systems which have amortized their development costs across multiple government and non-government programs should favor a “buy” decision by commercial space station operators. As these markets arise, commercial companies will be in a position to provide logistics services at a fraction of the cost of government-developed systems. The resulting economies of scale will benefit both markets. This conclusion was reached by a Price-Waterhouse study chartered by NASA in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Price Waterhouse, Analysis of NASA lease and purchase alternatives for the commercial Middeck augmentation module, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that the value of SPACEHAB's flight-asset-based commercial module service with an estimated net-present-value of $160 million would have cost the US government over $1 billion to develop and operate using standard cost plus contracting. SPACEHAB's commercial operations and developments (such as the Integrated Cargo Carrier) since 1991 represent further cost savings over government-owned and operated systems.

:Commercial companies are more likely to efficiently invest private capital in service enhancements, assured continued availability, and enhanced service capability. This tendency, commonplace in non-aerospace applications, has been demonstrated by SPACEHAB in the commercial space systems market via continued module enhancements and introduction of new logistics carriers.

:Shortfalls in ISS cargo transport capacity, emerging opportunities, and experience gained from SPACEHAB's existing ground and flight operations have encouraged development of Commercial Payload Service (CPS). As a commercially developed system, SPACEHAB recognizes that to optimize its capability and affordability requires that certain approaches in system development and operations be taken.

:The first approach levies moderate requirements on the system. Introducing fundamental capabilities on the front end and scarring for enhanced capabilities later reduces cost to launch and shortens development time.

:The second one is the utilization of existing technology and capabilities, where appropriate. A typical feature of NASA programs is the continual reach for newly developed technologies. While attractive from a technical advancement perspective, this quest is expensive and often fails to create operational capabilities. A commercially developed cargo module will maximize the use of existing technologies (off the shelf where possible) and seek technical advances only where system requirements or market conditions drive the need for such advances. Additionally, costs associated with the development of spacecraft are not limited to those associated with the vehicle systems. Significant costs associated with the infrastructure must also be considered. SPACEHAB's existing logistics and vehicle processing facilities co-located with the Eastern launch range and at the Sea Launch facilities enable avoidance of significant system development costs.

:Finally, SPACEHAB has realized cost and schedule reductions by employing commercial processes instead of Government processes. As a result, SPACEHAB's mission integration template for a Shuttle-based carrier is 14 months, compared to 22 months for a similar Shuttle-based Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM).&lt;ref&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Station program implementation plan, vol. 6: Cargo Physical Integration, SSP 50200-06, December 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rack transfer capability===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:The ISS utilizes the [[International Standard Payload Rack]] (ISPR) as the primary payload and experiment accommodations structure in all US operated modules. Transferring ISPRs onto and off the ISS requires passage through the hatch only found at the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) berthing locations. The diameter of the CBM combined with ISPR proportions typically drives cargo vehicle diameters to sizes only accommodated by 5 m payload fairings launched on Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELV).

===Recoverable reentry–pressurized payloads===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:The Russian Progress vehicle has long served as a cargo vehicle which, upon departing a space station, destructively reenters the atmosphere destroying all “cargo” on board. This approach works very effectively for removing unwanted mass from a space station. However, NASA has indicated that the return of payloads from the ISS is highly desirable [5]. Therefore, a commercial system must examine the implications of including a pressurized payload return capability either in the initial design or as an enhanced feature of the service to be introduced in the future. Providing such capability requires the incorporation of thermal protection subsystem, deorbit targeting subsystems, landing recovery subsystems, ground recovery infrastructure, and FAA licensure. The recovery of unpressurized payloads presents unique challenges associated with the exposed nature of unpressurized carriers. To implement a recoverable reentry system for unpressurized payloads requires the development of an encapsulation system. Encapsulation activities must either occur autonomously prior to reentry or as a part of the operations associated with loading the unpressurized cargo carrier with return cargo. In either case, additional cost associated with spacecraft systems or increased operational requirements will be higher than simply loading and departing a pressurized carrier for a destructive reentry.

===Mixed manifest capability===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:Typically, the avoidance of point solutions provides flexibility for a given system to provide variable capabilities. Designing a cargo carrier that mixes pressurized and unpressurized systems can lead to increased cost if all associated cargo accommodations must be flown on every flight. To avoid unnecessary costs associated with designing and flying structure that accommodates fixed relative capacities of all types of payloads, a modular approach is taken for CPS. Anticipated cargo transport requirements for ISS after the Shuttle is retired indicate that dedicated pressurized and unpressurized missions can support the ISS up-mass requirements. Utilizing common base features (i.e. service module, docking system, etc.) and modularizing the pressurized and unpressurized carrier elements of the spacecraft assures flexibility while avoiding point solutions.

===Propellant transfer===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:The Russian Segment of the ISS (RSOS) has the capability via the probe and cone docking mechanisms to support propellant transfer. Incorporation of propellant transfer capability introduces international issues requiring the coordination of multiple corporate and governmental organizations. Since ISS propellant requirements are adequately provided for by the Russian Progress and ESA ATV, costs associated with incorporating these features can be avoided. However, the CPS’ modular nature coupled with the inherent capability of selected subsystems enables economical alternatives to propellant transfer should ISS needs require.

:Indirect costs considered in developing the CPS architecture include licensing requirements associated with [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] (ITAR) and the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) commercial launch and entry licensing requirements. ITAR licensing drives careful selection of the vehicle subsystem suppliers. Any utilization or manufacturing of spacecraft subsystems by non-US entities can only be implemented once the appropriate Department of State and/or Commerce approvals are in place. FAA licensing requirements necessitate careful selection of the launch and landing sites. Vehicles developed by a US organized corporation, even if launched in another country, require review of the vehicle system, operations, and safety program by the FAA to ensure that risks to people and property are within acceptable limits &lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Administration-Office of Commercial Space Transportation, 14 CFR, November 2000 (Chapter III).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downmass==
While significant focus of space logistics is on ''upmass'', or payload mass carried up to orbit from Earth, space station operations also have significant downmass requirements. 
Returning cargo from [[low-Earth orbit]] to Earth is known as transporting ''downmass'', the total logistics payload mass that is returned from space to the surface of the Earth for subsequent use or analysis.&lt;ref name=nsfdc20120420/&gt;
Downmass logistics are important aspects of [[Research and development|research]] and [[manufacturing]] work that occurs in orbital space facilities.

For the [[International Space Station]], there have been periods of time when downmass capability was severely restricted.  For example, for approximately ten months from the time of the retirement of the Space Shuttle following the [[STS-135]] mission in July 2011—and the resultant loss of the Space Shuttle's ability to return payload mass—an increasing concern became returning downmass cargo from [[low-Earth orbit]] to Earth for subsequent use or analysis.&lt;ref name=nsfdc20120420&gt;
{{cite news |last=Bergin|first=Chris |title=Cargo up and down: Dragon to demonstrate the importance of downmass |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/04/cargo-up-down-spacexs-dragon-demonstrate-importance-downmass/ |accessdate=2012-04-23 |newspaper=NASA Spaceflight |date=2012-04-20 |quote=''"Cargo runs in general are vital to the Station, however, not least since the end of the massive capability enjoyed by the ISS via the Space Shuttle fleet. With the orbiters now retired, an array of resupply vehicles are aiming to take up the slack, ranging from the ongoing Russian Progress vehicles, to Europe’s ATV, Japan’s HTV and – to a very small extent – the Russian Soyuz vehicles.  However, it was the additional capability of the Shuttle’s downmass role with the ISS that was often understated during the final years of their flights to the Station, something the Russian, European and Japanese resupply vehicles could not mitigate once the fleet was retired, bar the very small downmass allowed by the Soyuz."''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During this period of time, of the four space vehicles capable of reaching and delivering cargo to the International Space Station, only the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] vehicle could return even a very small cargo payload to Earth. The Soyuz cargo downmass capability was limited as the entire [[space capsule]] was filled to capacity with the three ISS crew members who return on each Soyuz return.  None of the remaining [[Comparison of space station cargo vehicles|cargo resupply vehicles]] — the [[Russian Space Agency]] [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]], the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]], the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) [[H-II Transfer Vehicle|HTV]] — can return any downmass cargo for terrestrial use or examination.&lt;ref name=nsfdc20120420/&gt;

After 2012, with the successful berthing of the [[private spaceflight|commercially contracted]] [[SpaceX]] [[Dragon spacecraft|Dragon]] during the [[COTS Demo Flight 2|Dragon C2+]] mission in May 2012, and the [[SpaceX CRS-1|initiation of operational cargo flights]] in October 2012,&lt;ref name=bbc20121028&gt;
{{cite news |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=28 October 2012 |accessdate=23 December 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20118963 |title=SpaceX capsule returns with safe landing in Pacific}}&lt;/ref&gt; downmass capability from the ISS is now {{convert|3000|kg}} per Dragon flight, a service that is uniquely provided by the Dragon cargo capsule.&lt;ref name=sen20121224&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Black|first=Charles |title=When Dragon made commercial spaceflight a reality|journal=SEN|date=2012-12-24 |url=http://www.sen.com/news/when-dragon-made-private-space-real.html |accessdate=2012-12-26 |quote=''[Dragon's] ability to return goods is currently unique because all the other regular supply ships - Europe's Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), Japan's HTV (or "Kounotori") and Russia's Progress - all burn up during controlled re-entry.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of Falcon 9 launches|Nine additional Dragon cargo resupply flights]] are scheduled to depart the ISS with downmass in the next several years.

'''Thomas Robb Coughtrie''' (25 November 1917 – 27 August 2008) was credited by ''[[The Times]]'' as the inventor of the [[Mole wrench]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4964635.ece ''The Times'' obituary], 18 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, this conflicts with other references that show the invention of the [[Vise Grip]] [[locking pliers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe40s/machines_12.html|title=The Vise Grip Company of Nebraska|website=www.livinghistoryfarm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Nebraska with an initial patent in 1921 and fuller developments patented in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ud4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA326 ''1935 Popular mechanics magazine'', page 326 - invention of the Vise-Grip in Nebraska], 1935&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
It could be surmised{{according to whom|date=August 2018}} that M. K. Mole and Son produced their own version (the Mole Grip) based on the existing American Vise Grip. The likeness between the two is clear even from sketch drawings.

He was born in [[Motherwell]], [[Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]]. After his education at [[Bellshill]] Academy he qualified as a [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|chartered engineer]].

During the [[Second World War]], he was an electrical engineer involved in the maintenance of 1,000 ton 'Whale' floating roadways for [[Mulberry harbour]]s.

In 1947 he started working for the [[Birmingham]] engineering firm 'M. K. Mole and Son', founded in 1835. When the second Mole brother died in 1950 he became managing director of the company. In 1955 he patented the self-grip wrench.  In 1960 the Mole company, and Coughtrie, relocated to [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]].

Coughtrie received an [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctorate]] from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-graduates.htm|title=Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: Honorary Graduates|last=webperson@hw.ac.uk|website=www1.hw.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a director of [[Cwmbran|Cwmbrân New Town]], governor of four local technical colleges and, in 1978, deputy lieutenant for [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]].

'''Sir Thomas Neill''' (January 1856&amp;ndash;31 May 1937) was an [[Ireland|Irish]]-born [[insurance]] executive and pioneer of [[National Health Insurance]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

Neill was born in [[Cookstown]], [[County Tyrone]], the son of a land agent. He first became a railway booking clerk,and then an insurance agent in [[Ballymena]]. In 1894 he became [[general manager]] of the [[London, Edinburgh and Glasgow Insurance Company]] and joined the [[board of directors]] of the [[Phoenix Group|Pearl Insurance Company]] when it took over the former company in 1910.

When the National Health Insurance scheme came into force in 1911, Neill was appointed one of the three Insurance Commissioners. In 1915 he resigned to become chairman of the [[National Amalgamated Approved Society]], holding the post until his retirement in 1936.

He campaigned for the introduction of a [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Health]], which was founded in 1918, after which he became chairman of the Ministry's Consultative Council on Health Insurance Approved Societies until 1924. For this work, he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the 1920 New Year Honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31712 |date=30 December 1919 |page=3 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had four children, including the paediatrician [[Catherine Neill]] (1921–2006), the judge [[Brian Neill|Sir Brian Neill]] (1923–2017) and the barrister [[Patrick Neill, Baron Neill of Bladen]] (1926–2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/5609|work=[[Munk's Roll]] Volume XII|title=Catherine Annie Neill|first=Edward B|last=Clark|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6192">'''Trade in Services''' refers to the sale and delivery of an [[Intangible asset|intangible product]], called a service, between a producer and consumer.  Trade in services that takes place between a producer and consumer that are, in legal terms, based in different countries is called International Trade in Services.
  
== Methods of Trade ==
International trade in services is defined by the ''Four Modes of Supply'' of the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS).

* '''(Mode 1) Cross-Border Trade''' - which is defined as delivery of a service from the territory of one country into the territory of other country, e.g. remotely providing accounting services in one country for a company based in another country, or an airline flying between two international destinations
* '''(Mode 2) Consumption Abroad''' - this mode covers supply of a service of one country to the service consumer of any other country, e.g. tourism, telemedicine, or study-abroad
* '''(Mode 3) Commercial Presence''' - which covers services provided by a service supplier of one country in the territory of any other country, e.g. a bank opening a physical branch or internet service provider offering internet services in another country
* '''(Mode 4) Presence of Natural Persons''' - which covers services provided by a service supplier of one country through the presence of natural persons in the territory of any other country, e.g. a business transferring an employee from one country to another for work duties (doctors or architects traveling and working abroad) 

A "[[Natural person]]" is a human being, as distinct from legal persons such as companies or organisations.  Countries can freely decide where to [[economic liberalization|liberalize]] on a sector-by-sector basis, including which specific mode of supply they want to cover for a given sector.

Mode 2 (Consumption Abroad) is by far the most liberalized mode in terms of commitments by WTO members. This is mostly due to governments being less likely to restrict the movements of citizens outside domestic borders (e.g. tourists). Mode 1 (Cross-Border Trade) is not often committed, mostly because it is impossible for many services to be supplied remotely (e.g. construction services), while Mode 3 (Commercial Presence) is more open, reflecting its crucial role in driving the international supply of services, transferring know-how and improving the capacity of economies to participate in global value chains. Mode 4 (Presence of Natural Persons) has the lowest depth of commitments, probably due to a number of sensitivities involved with the movement of foreign workers.&lt;ref name="wto_services_brochure2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade In Services|url=https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/20y_e/services_brochure2015_e.pdf|website=World Trade Organization|publisher=World Trade Organization|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Value of Trade in Services ==
In 2014, global trade in services totaled some $4.8 trillion, with Mode 3 (commercial presence) accounting for 55% of the total, followed by Mode 1 (cross-border trade) at 30%, then Mode 2 ( consumption abroad) at 10%, and Mode 4 (presence of natural persons) the lowest share, at less than 5%.&lt;ref name="wto_services_brochure2015"/&gt;

In wealthy developed economies, services comprise a significant share of GDP and employment. For example, services account for 70% of economic output in the United States and 75% in the European Union.

== Trade Agreements and Law ==
During the Uruguay Round of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the General Agreement on Trade in Services was drafted, and became enshrined as one of the four pillars of the international treaty comprising the [[World Trade Organization]] Agreement in 1995. 

Regional trade in services agreements are also negotiated and signed between regional economic groupings such as [[CARICOM]], [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and [[ASEAN]].

Beginning in February 2012, 50 countries (28 of which are represented by the European Union) around the world began negotiating the [[Trade in Services Agreement]] (TISA). TISA negotiations primarily comprised high- and upper-middle income countries who were members of the WTO and hoped to further liberalize trade in financial services, healthcare, and transportation between themselves. The agreement has not progressed since early 2016 due to uncertainty surrounding negotiations in the aftermath of many elections that occurred that year.

== Examples ==

Some of the most common examples of trade in service would be:&lt;ref name="wto_services_brochure2015"/&gt;

'''Whole-of-Government Approach''' (“WGA”) refers to the joint activities performed by diverse [[Ministry (government department)|Ministries]], [[Public Administration]]s and [[Public agency|Public Agencies]] in order to provide a common solution to a particular problem or issue.

The approach and content of the initiatives can be formal or informal. Areas covered can be related to [[policy development]], public project management or [[public service]]s.&lt;ref&gt;“Connecting Government report”, Management Advisory Committee (MAC) for the Australian Government (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural reforms performed within Public Administrations during the past decades, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries, have introduced this new methodology which aims to reflect individual Government’s global policy and priorities through the improvement and coordination of services. WGA also seeks to introduce coherence in the decision making process of Public Administrations.

== Background ==

The first reference to this operational approach is found in Tony Blair’s Administration in the United Kingdom. It was then referred to as Joined-Up-Government (“JG”).&lt;ref name="jug"&gt;{{cite news|title=So what is joined-up government?|work=[[BBC News]]|date=23 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By means of this methodology the Government tried to overcome the existing problem of departmentalism within the rigid structures of public institutions, hampering the use of existing resources and incentives.&lt;ref&gt;“Can Joined-up-Government be a reality?”, David Richards and Dennis Kavanagh, University of Liverpool (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  Departmentalism leads to complex procedures in order to deliver desired policy outcomes.

Policy reforms implemented within the Administration were based on the principle that traditional processes, independent in each Government Department or Public Institution, is built according to past reforms, but is also a reflection of past failures.

Nowadays, several internal and external issues justify the coordination among different public administrations:

a) External issues:

Pressures from public opinion, budgetary constraints, security, counterterrorism and environmental impact are some examples of the limitations imposed by external factors. These issues show a growing complexity of social problems and demand meaningful experiences in diverse areas, reflective knowledge and strategic answers to provide solutions.

b) Internal issues:

Aligning common interests, avoiding task duplications, reducing costs, increasing productivity and achieving a coherent line of action, in order to provide desired results, are some elements that stimulate the improvement of vertical and horizontal coordination of different Government Departments and Public Institutions.

== Methodology ==

On a national stage, the methodology of a WGA challenges the established regulation and political context of any given country. Governmental structures were originally designed for Agencies and Ministries working and approaching issues individually.   The challenge is to develop new legal supportive structures for shared frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;“The Whole of Government Approach”, Working paper, Stein Rokkan Centre for Social Studies, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooperative structures develop as a result of collaboration rather than through hierarchic pressures, thus coordination goals can be achieved by soft and systematic techniques, with a higher degree of consideration on pragmatic interaction before formal interaction. This has been the case of Public Administrations in Canada, where horizontal collaboration has been encouraged through internal communication of “Best Practices” and “Lessons Learned” of selected projects.&lt;ref&gt;“Basic Research The horizontal challenge”, Bakvis, H. &amp; Julliet, L. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in order to achieve a successful WGA, results are also necessary on the vertical array, where voluntary collaboration is constrained as each actor is part of a definite hierarchical configuration. In this case, a centralized element of leadership is necessary to coordinate the agenda and to supervise principles and policies that need to be accomplished.

The methodology of the Australian Government, to perform projects with a WGA, builds within a simple framework of a shared definition of Top-Down goals, in order to align the interests of the various departments involved. Moreover, each department works internally in order to attain the accorded objectives.&lt;ref&gt;“Developing Whole-Of-Government Performance Indicators”, Discussion Paper Council on the Cost and Quality of Government (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| 3. Human Resources requirements || Specification of all services to be provided in order to complete necessary tasks
|-
| 4. Financial requirements|| Definition of actual departments and agencies to be involved and their degree of involvement
|}

Ongoing efforts have to be measurable and regularly assessed. Metric indicators are needed in order to measure the development and the success/ failure of any Project.

== WGA on International Cooperation issues ==

One of the main functions of a WGA, in the international arena, relates to intergovernmental coordination towards the assistance provided to Fragile States. A growing international concern towards terrorism and other security issues after the attacks on September 11 and the military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, together with reiterative downfalls of some unstable states that where left alone to providence, have led into unexpected consequences within the International Arena:

* Many limitations of traditional military and diplomatic interventions have been uncovered.
* There is a general agreement towards the need for a greater impetus from developed Governments, to come up with viable formulas towards the progress and well-being of Fragile States, due to these nations’ specific deprived conditions and risks.
	
Research conducted in this direction highlight the contributions that WGA can bring, towards the achievement of long term development and stability to Fragile States at a lower cost. Moreover, the application of this methodology reduces the risk of failure to meeting planned objectives.&lt;ref&gt;“Whole of Government Approaches to Fragile States”, OECD Governance, Peace and Security papers (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Workforce modeling''' is the process by which the need for skilled workers at a particular point in time (demand) is matched directly with the availability and preference of [[skilled workers]] (supply).  The resulting mathematical models may be used to perform [[sensitivity analysis]] and generate data output in the form of reports and schedules.

Due to the complexity level of building a workforce model, adoption of a workforce model is usually found in industries that have complex work rules, skilled or certified workers, medium to large teams of workers and fluctuating demand.  Some examples include [[healthcare]], [[public safety]], and retail.

A workforce modeling solution can also refer to software that effectively captures all the complexity of process from start to finish and delivers complete and correct results.  Components include:
*[[Demand management]] – tracking the demand for skilled workers by small units of time (generally 15 or 30 minutes)
*Employee availability – tracking of contractual work hour obligations and limits on an individual basis for each employee
*Employee preference – tracking of preferred times and dates that employees wish to work (used to help increase [[job satisfaction]])
*[[Workflow management]] – ability for the solution to automate normally manual processes such as requesting and approving time off, requesting shift swaps, and generating and posting schedules
*Optimization Engine – uses the mathematical model to create numerous schedules that are complete and correct and can be optimized on many dimensions simultaneously.  The most important are cost, [[overtime]] and [[employee satisfaction]]

==Definition==
For a more detailed definition, the term must be differentiated from traditional staff [[Schedule (workplace)|scheduling]]. Staff scheduling is rooted in [[time management]] and encompasses the mere administration of past and future working times. However, during the last ten to fifteen years, this traditional approach has evolved towards a demand-oriented solution which, under economic aspects, also includes changes in personnel requirements and objectives when optimizing the scheduling of staff. Besides the two core aspects of demand-orientation and optimization, workforce modeling also incorporates the forecast of the workload and the required staff, the integration of employees into the scheduling process through interactivity, the management of working times and accounts as well as analyzing and monitoring the entire process.

Workforce modeling solutions can, and should, be deployed enterprise-wide wherever complex scheduling needs or legal staffing ratios must be met.  Due to the complex nature of a workforce model, creating one by hand is nearly impossible.  By using a software solution for demand-oriented workforce management, planners can optimize staffing by creating schedules that at all times conform as closely as possible to the actual requirement. At the same time, a workforce modeling solution helps users to observe all relevant legislation, local agreements and the contracts with individual employees – including [[work-life balance]] guidelines.

==Complexity of model==
Many workforce modeling solution applications use the more common [[linear programming]] approach to create the Workforce Model. Linear methods of achieving a schedule are generally based on assumptions that demand is based on a series of independent events, all of which have a consistent, predictable outcome.&lt;ref name="Clancy, Thomas R. 2008"&gt;Clancy, Thomas R. ''Managing Organizational Complexity in Healthcare Operations.'' The Journal of Nursing Administration 38.9 (2008): 367-70. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this method is very common, the results are in most cases not as complete or efficient.  In general, they produce a resulting schedule that is up to 75% complete and leaves the scheduler to complete the remaining shift assignments.

[[Heuristics]] have been applied to the problem and [[metaheuristics]] has been identified as the best method for generating complex scheduling solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Edmund, Patrick De Causmaecker, Greet Vanden Berghe, and Hendrik Van Landeghem. ''[https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/123829/1/JOS_ The State of the Art of Nurse Rostering].'' Journal of Scheduling 7.6 (2004): 441-99. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Using this technique, many more solutions are available to the modeling process resulting in schedules that are not only closer to 100% complete, but are also optimized to many different criteria at the same time.&lt;ref name="Clancy, Thomas R. 2008"/&gt;
