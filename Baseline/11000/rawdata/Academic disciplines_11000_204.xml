      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2490">'''Aerolite''' is a [[urea-formaldehyde]] gap filling adhesive which is water- and heat-resistant. It is used in large quantities by the [[Particle board|chipboard]] industry and also by wooden boat builders for its high strength and durability. It is also used in [[joiner]]y, [[Wood veneer|veneer]]ing and general woodwork assembly. Aerolite has also been used for wooden aircraft construction, and a properly made Aerolite joint is said to be three times stronger than [[spruce]] wood.

==History==
Dr. [[Norman de Bruyne|Norman A. de Bruyne]] founded [[Aero Research Limited]] in 1934. The following year de Bruyne suggested that synthetic adhesives might play a part in aircraft production and engaged [[Cambridge University]] chemist R.E. Clark to investigate new adhesives for aircraft applications. The result was Aerolite, a urea-formaldehyde adhesive which unlike conventional glues of the time, resisted water and micro-organisms. Further research showed that gap-bridging hardeners incorporating [[formic acid]] enabled Aerolite to be used as an assembly adhesive. Aerolite was the first adhesive of its type to be invented and manufactured in Britain and used in resin-bonded plywood.&lt;ref name=travis&gt;{{cite book | last = Travis  | first = A. S. | authorlink =  |author2= Harm G. Schröter | title = Determinants in the Evolution of the European Chemical Industry, 1900-1939 | publisher = Springer | date =   1998 | location =  | nopp =  | page = 183 | url =  | isbn = 0-7923-4890-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[World War II]] broke out, the small company began to grow.  [[Morris Motors]] used Aerolite and Aero Research's strip heating process to assemble [[Airspeed Horsa]] gliders, as did de Havilland on its [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]], as well as on other aircraft and also naval launches and patrol boats.

Following the end of the war, in 1948 de Bruyne sold control of Aero Research to the Swiss company [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals|Ciba]], but remained as managing director until 1960.

Aerolite is currently marketed for use in [[boat building]].

'''Aerotolerant anaerobes''' use [[fermentation]] to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. They do not utilize [[oxygen]], but they can protect themselves from reactive oxygen molecules. In contrast, [[obligate anaerobe]]s can be harmed by reactive oxygen molecules.

There are three categories of [[anaerobe]]s. [[Obligate anaerobe]]s are damaged by the presence of oxygen. '''Aerotolerant organisms''' cannot use oxygen for growth but are tolerate its presence. And [[facultative anaerobe]]s can grow without oxygen but use oxygen if it is present.

Aerotolerant anaerobes have [[superoxide dismutase]] and [[peroxidase]] but don't have [[catalase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://textbookofbacteriology.net/nutgro_4.html|title=Nutrition and Growth of Bacteria|first=Kenneth Todar, Madison,|last=WI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an aerotolerant anaerobe is ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]''. (Facultative anaerobe)

[[Image:Euclid flowchart.svg|thumb|right| [[Flowchart]] of an algorithm ([[Euclid's algorithm]]) for calculating the greatest common divisor (g.c.d.) of two numbers ''a'' and ''b'' in locations named A and B. The algorithm proceeds by successive subtractions in two loops: IF the test B ≥ A yields "yes" (or true) (more accurately the ''number'' ''b'' in location B is greater than or equal to the ''number'' ''a'' in location A) THEN, the algorithm specifies B ← B − A (meaning the number ''b'' − ''a'' replaces the old ''b''). Similarly, IF A &gt; B, THEN A ← A − B. The process terminates when (the contents of) B is 0, yielding the g.c.d. in A. (Algorithm derived from Scott 2009:13; symbols and drawing style from Tausworthe 1977).]]

In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], an '''algorithm''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-algorithm.ogg|ˈ|æ|l|ɡ|ə|r|ɪ|ð|əm}}) is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform [[calculation]], [[data processing]] and [[automated reasoning]] tasks.

As an [[effective method]], an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time&lt;ref&gt;"Any classical mathematical algorithm, for example, can be described in a finite number of English words" (Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt; and in a well-defined formal language&lt;ref&gt;Well defined with respect to the agent that executes the algorithm: "There is a computing agent, usually human, which can react to the instructions and carry out the computations" (Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt; for calculating a [[Function (mathematics)|function]].&lt;ref&gt;"an algorithm is a procedure for computing a ''function'' (with respect to some chosen notation for integers) ... this limitation (to numerical functions) results in no loss of generality", (Rogers 1987:1).&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps [[Empty string|empty]]),&lt;ref&gt;"An algorithm has [[zero]] or more inputs, i.e., [[quantity|quantities]] which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; the instructions describe a [[computation]] that, when [[Execution (computing)|executed]], proceeds through a finite&lt;ref&gt;"A procedure which has all the characteristics of an algorithm except that it possibly lacks finiteness may be called a 'computational method'" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"&lt;ref&gt;"An algorithm has one or more outputs, i.e. quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily [[deterministic]]; some algorithms, known as [[randomized algorithms]], incorporate random input.&lt;ref&gt;Whether or not a process with random interior processes (not including the input) is an algorithm is debatable. Rogers opines that: "a computation is carried out in a discrete stepwise fashion, without use of continuous methods or analogue devices . . . carried forward deterministically, without resort to random methods or devices, e.g., dice" Rogers 1987:2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of algorithm has existed for centuries. Greek mathematicians used algorithms in, for example, the [[sieve of Eratosthenes]] for finding prime numbers and the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers.&lt;ref name=Cooke2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooke |first=Roger L. |title=The History of Mathematics: A Brief Course |date=2005 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118460290}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word ''algorithm'' itself derives from the 9th century mathematician [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]], Latinized ''Algoritmi''. A partial formalization of what would become the modern concept of algorithm began with attempts to solve the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] (decision problem) posed by [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Later formalizations were framed as attempts to define "[[effective calculability]]"&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:274&lt;/ref&gt; or "effective method".&lt;ref&gt;Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:225&lt;/ref&gt; Those formalizations included the [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]–[[Jacques Herbrand|Herbrand]]–[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]] of 1930, 1934 and 1935, [[Alonzo Church]]'s [[lambda calculus]] of 1936, [[Emil Post]]'s [[Formulation 1]] of 1936, and [[Alan Turing]]'s [[Turing machines]] of 1936–37 and 1939.

== Etymology ==
The word 'algorithm' has its roots in Latinizing the name of [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi]] in a first step to ''algorismus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Al-Khwarizmi.html|title=Al-Khwarizmi biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etymology of algorithm|url=http://chambers.co.uk/search/?query=algorithm&amp;title=21st|website=Chambers Dictionary|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwārizmī ({{lang-fa|خوارزمی}}, c. 780–850) was a [[Persian people|Persian]]  mathematician, [[astronomer]], [[geographer]], and scholar in the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]], whose name means 'the native of [[Khwarezm]]', a region that was part of [[Greater Iran]] and is now in [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name="Hogendijk"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jan P. |last=Hogendijk |title=al-Khwarzimi |journal=Pythagoras |volume=38 |issue=2 |year=1998 |pages=4–5 |url=http://www.kennislink.nl/web/show?id=116543 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412193516/http://www.kennislink.nl/web/show?id=116543 |archivedate=April 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oaks"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jeffrey A.|last=Oaks|url=http://facstaff.uindy.edu/~oaks/MHMC.htm|title=Was al-Khwarizmi an applied algebraist?|publisher=[[University of Indianapolis]]|accessdate=May 30, 2008|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGLbfttF?url=http://facstaff.uindy.edu/~oaks/MHMC.htm|archive-date=November 15, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 825, al-Khwarizmi wrote an [[Arabic language]] treatise on the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]], which was translated into [[Latin]] during the 12th century under the title ''Algoritmi de numero Indorum''. This title means "Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians", where "Algoritmi" was the translator's [[Latinisation of names|Latinization]] of Al-Khwarizmi's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Brezina| first = Corona| title = Al-Khwarizmi: The Inventor Of Algebra| url = https://books.google.com/?id=955jPgAACAAJ| year = 2006| publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group| isbn = 978-1-4042-0513-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwarizmi was the most widely read mathematician in Europe in the late Middle Ages, primarily through another of his books, the [[Al-Jabr|Algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Boyer_Foremost_Text.html Foremost mathematical texts in history], according to [[Carl B. Boyer]].&lt;/ref&gt; In late medieval Latin, ''algorismus'', English '[[algorism]]', the corruption of his name, simply meant the "decimal number system". In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word ἀριθμός 'number' (''cf.'' 'arithmetic'), the Latin word was altered to ''algorithmus'', and the corresponding English term 'algorithm' is first attested in the 17th century; the modern sense was introduced in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Third Edition, 2012 [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/4959 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, it was first used in about 1230 and then by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] in 1391. English adopted the French term, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that "algorithm" took on the meaning that it has in modern English.

Another early use of the word is from 1240, in a manual titled ''Carmen de Algorismo'' composed by [[Alexander of Villedieu|Alexandre de Villedieu]]. It begins thus:

{{quote|''Haec algorismus ars praesens dicitur, in qua / Talibus Indorum fruimur bis quinque figuris.''}}
which translates as:
{{quote|Algorism is the art by which at present we use those Indian figures, which number two times five.}}

The poem is a few hundred lines long and summarizes the art of calculating with the new style of Indian dice, or Talibus Indorum, or Hindu numerals.

==Informal definition==
{{about||a detailed presentation of the various points of view on the definition of "algorithm"| Algorithm characterizations}}
An informal definition could be "a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations."&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1973:4&lt;/ref&gt; which would include all computer programs, including programs that do not perform numeric calculations. Generally, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually.&lt;ref&gt;Stone simply requires that "it must terminate in a finite number of steps" (Stone 1973:7–8).&lt;/ref&gt;

A prototypical example of an algorithm is the [[Euclidean algorithm]] to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers; an example (there are others) is described by the [[flowchart]] above and as an example in a later section.

{{Harvtxt|Boolos|Jeffrey|1974, 1999|ref=CITEREFBoolosJeffrey1999}} offer an informal meaning of the word in the following quotation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No human being can write fast enough, or long enough, or small enough† ( †"smaller and smaller without limit ...you'd be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons") to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation. But humans can do something equally useful, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets: They can give ''explicit instructions for determining the '''n'''th member of the set'', for arbitrary finite ''n''. Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which ''they could be followed by a computing machine'', or by a ''human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols.''&lt;ref&gt;Boolos and Jeffrey 1974,1999:19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An "enumerably infinite set" is one whose elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. Thus, Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that "creates" output integers from an ''arbitrary'' "input" integer or integers that, in theory, can be arbitrarily large. Thus an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as ''y = m + n'' – two arbitrary "input variables" ''m'' and ''n'' that produce an output ''y''. But various authors' attempts to define the notion indicate that the word implies much more than this, something on the order of (for the addition example):
:Precise instructions (in language understood by "the computer")&lt;ref&gt;cf Stone 1972:5&lt;/ref&gt; for a fast, efficient, "good"&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:7 states: "In practice we not only want algorithms, we want ''good'' algorithms ... one criterion of goodness is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm ... other criteria are the adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity, and elegance, etc."&lt;/ref&gt; process that specifies the "moves" of "the computer" (machine or human, equipped with the necessary internally contained information and capabilities)&lt;ref&gt;cf Stone 1973:6&lt;/ref&gt; to find, decode, and then process arbitrary input integers/symbols ''m'' and ''n'', symbols ''+'' and ''='' ... and "effectively"&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1973:7–8 states that there must be, "...a procedure that a robot [i.e., computer] can follow in order to determine precisely how to obey the instruction." Stone adds finiteness of the process, and definiteness (having no ambiguity in the instructions) to this definition.&lt;/ref&gt; produce, in a "reasonable" time,&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, loc. cit&lt;/ref&gt; output-integer ''y'' at a specified place and in a specified format.

The concept of ''algorithm'' is also used to define the notion of [[decidability (logic)|decidability]]. That notion is central for explaining how [[formal system]]s come into being starting from a small set of [[axiom]]s and rules. In [[logic]], the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related to our customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of ''algorithm'' that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.

==Formalization==
&lt;!-- [[Computer program]] links here. --&gt;
Algorithms are essential to the way computers process data. Many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should perform (in a specific order) to carry out a specified task, such as calculating employees' paychecks or printing students' report cards. Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a [[Turing reduction|Turing-complete]] system. Authors who assert this thesis include Minsky (1967), Savage (1987) and Gurevich (2000):
&lt;blockquote&gt; Minsky: "But we will also maintain, with Turing . . . that any procedure which could "naturally" be called effective, can, in fact, be realized by a (simple) machine. Although this may seem extreme, the arguments . . . in its favor are hard to refute".&lt;ref name="Minsky 1967:105"&gt;{{harvnb|Minsky|1967|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;Gurevich: "...Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine ... according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational process defined by a Turing machine".&lt;ref&gt;Gurevich 2000:1, 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Typically, when an algorithm is associated with processing information, data can be read from an input source, written to an output device and stored for further processing. Stored data are regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm. In practice, the state is stored in one or more [[data structure]]s.

For some such computational process, the algorithm must be rigorously defined: specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise. That is, any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with, case-by-case; the criteria for each case must be clear (and computable).

Because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps, the order of computation is always crucial to the functioning of the algorithm. Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly, and are described as starting "from the top" and going "down to the bottom", an idea that is described more formally by ''[[control flow|flow of control]]''.

So far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of [[imperative programming]]. This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, "mechanical" means. Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the [[assignment operation]], setting the value of a variable. It derives from the intuition of "[[memory]]" as a scratchpad. There is an example below of such an assignment.

For some alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm see [[functional programming]] and [[logic programming]].

===Expressing algorithms===
Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including [[natural language]]s, [[pseudocode]], [[flowchart]]s, [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]], [[programming language]]s or [[control table]]s (processed by [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreters]]). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]] and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.

There is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given [[Turing machine]] program as a sequence of machine tables (see more at [[finite-state machine]], [[state transition table]] and [[control table]]), as flowcharts and [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]] (see more at [[state diagram]]), or as a form of rudimentary [[machine code]] or [[assembly code]] called "sets of quadruples" (see more at [[Turing machine]]).

Representations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description:&lt;ref&gt;Sipser 2006:157&lt;/ref&gt;
; 1 High-level description
: "...prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details. At this level, we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head."
; 2 Implementation description
: "...prose used to define the way the Turing machine uses its head and the way that it stores data on its tape. At this level, we do not give details of states or transition function."
; 3 Formal description
: Most detailed, "lowest level", gives the Turing machine's "state table".

For an example of the simple algorithm "Add m+n" described in all three levels, see [[Algorithm#Examples]].

==Design==

{{See also|Algorithm#By design paradigm}}

Algorithm design refers to a method or mathematical process for problem-solving and engineering algorithms. The design of algorithms is part of many solution theories of [[operation research]], such as [[dynamic programming]] and [[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide-and-conquer]]. Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://ww3.algorithmdesign.net/ch00-front.html|title=Algorithm Design: Foundations, Analysis, and Internet Examples|last1=Goodrich|first1=Michael T.|author1-link=Michael T. Goodrich|last2=Tamassia|first2=Roberto|author2-link=Roberto Tamassia|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2002|isbn=0-471-38365-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the template method pattern and decorator pattern.

One of the most important aspects of algorithm design is creating an algorithm that has an efficient run-time, also known as its [[Big O notation|Big O]].

Typical steps in the development of algorithms:
# Problem definition
# Development of a model
# Specification of the algorithm
# Designing an algorithm
# Checking the correctness of the algorithm
# Analysis of algorithm
# Implementation of algorithm
# Program testing
# Documentation preparation

==Implementation==
[[Image:TTL npn nand.svg|right|thumb|[[Logical NAND]] algorithm implemented electronically in [[7400 series|7400]] chip]]
Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as [[computer programs]]. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a [[biological neural network]] (for example, the [[human brain]] implementing [[arithmetic]] or an insect looking for food), in an [[electrical circuit]], or in a mechanical device.

==Computer algorithms==
[[File:Euclid's algorithm structured blocks 1.png|thumb|right|176px|Flowchart examples of the canonical [[Structured program theorem|Böhm-Jacopini structures]]: the SEQUENCE (rectangles descending the page), the WHILE-DO and the IF-THEN-ELSE. The three structures are made of the primitive conditional GOTO (&lt;tt&gt;IF ''test''=true THEN GOTO step xxx&lt;/tt&gt;) (a diamond), the unconditional GOTO (rectangle), various assignment operators (rectangle), and HALT (rectangle). Nesting of these structures inside assignment-blocks result in complex diagrams (cf Tausworthe 1977:100,114).]]

In [[computer systems]], an algorithm is basically an instance of [[logic]] written in software by software developers, to be effective for the intended "target" computer(s) to produce ''output'' from given (perhaps null) ''input''. An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than a non-optimal (higher [[time complexity]]) algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware; that is why algorithms, like computer hardware, are considered technology.

''"Elegant" (compact) programs, "good" (fast) programs '': The notion of "simplicity and elegance" appears informally in [[Donald Knuth|Knuth]] and precisely in [[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]]:
:Knuth: ". . .we want ''good'' algorithms in some loosely defined aesthetic sense. One criterion . . . is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm . . .. Other criteria are adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc"&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:7&lt;/ref&gt;

:Chaitin: " . . . a program is 'elegant,' by which I mean that it's the smallest possible program for producing the output that it does"&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin 2005:32&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaitin prefaces his definition with: "I'll show you can't prove that a program is 'elegant'"—such proof would solve the [[Halting problem]] (ibid).

''Algorithm versus function computable by an algorithm'': For a given function multiple algorithms may exist. This is true, even without expanding the available instruction set available to the programmer. Rogers observes that "It is . . . important to distinguish between the notion of ''algorithm'', i.e. procedure and the notion of ''function computable by algorithm'', i.e. mapping yielded by the procedure. The same function may have several different algorithms".&lt;ref&gt;Rogers 1987:1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, there may be a tradeoff between goodness (speed) and elegance (compactness)—an elegant program may take more steps to complete a computation than one less elegant. An example that uses Euclid's algorithm appears below.

''Computers (and computors), models of computation'': A computer (or human "computor"&lt;ref&gt;In his essay "Calculations by Man and Machine: Conceptual Analysis" Seig 2002:390 credits this distinction to Robin Gandy, cf Wilfred Seig, et al., 2002 ''Reflections on the foundations of mathematics: Essays in honor of Solomon Feferman'', Association for Symbolic Logic, A. K Peters Ltd, Natick, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a restricted type of machine, a "discrete deterministic mechanical device"&lt;ref&gt;cf Gandy 1980:126, Robin Gandy ''Church's Thesis and Principles for Mechanisms'' appearing on pp. 123–148 in [[Jon Barwise|J. Barwise]] et al. 1980 ''The Kleene Symposium'', North-Holland Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; that blindly follows its instructions.&lt;ref&gt;A "robot": "A computer is a robot that performs any task that can be described as a sequence of instructions." cf Stone 1972:3&lt;/ref&gt; Melzak's and Lambek's primitive models&lt;ref&gt;Lambek's "abacus" is a "countably infinite number of locations (holes, wires etc.) together with an unlimited supply of counters (pebbles, beads, etc). The locations are distinguishable, the counters are not". The holes have unlimited capacity, and standing by is an agent who understands and is able to carry out the list of instructions" (Lambek 1961:295). Lambek references Melzak who defines his Q-machine as "an indefinitely large number of locations . . . an indefinitely large supply of counters distributed among these locations, a program, and an operator whose sole purpose is to carry out the program" (Melzak 1961:283). B-B-J (loc. cit.) add the stipulation that the holes are "capable of holding any number of stones" (p. 46). Both Melzak and Lambek appear in ''The Canadian Mathematical Bulletin'', vol. 4, no. 3, September 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; reduced this notion to four elements: (i) discrete, distinguishable ''locations'', (ii) discrete, indistinguishable ''counters''&lt;ref&gt;If no confusion results, the word "counters" can be dropped, and a location can be said to contain a single "number".&lt;/ref&gt; (iii) an agent, and (iv) a list of instructions that are ''effective'' relative to the capability of the agent.&lt;ref&gt;"We say that an instruction is ''effective'' if there is a procedure that the robot can follow in order to determine precisely how to obey the instruction." (Stone 1972:6)&lt;/ref&gt;

Minsky describes a more congenial variation of Lambek's "abacus" model in his "Very Simple Bases for [[Computability]]".&lt;ref&gt;cf Minsky 1967: Chapter 11 "Computer models" and Chapter 14 "Very Simple Bases for Computability" pp. 255–281 in particular&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minsky machine|Minsky's machine]] proceeds sequentially through its five (or six, depending on how one counts) instructions, unless either a conditional IF–THEN GOTO or an unconditional GOTO changes program flow out of sequence. Besides HALT, Minsky's machine includes three ''assignment'' (replacement, substitution)&lt;ref&gt;cf Knuth 1973:3.&lt;/ref&gt; operations: ZERO (e.g. the contents of location replaced by 0: L ← 0), SUCCESSOR (e.g. L ← L+1), and DECREMENT (e.g. L ← L − 1).&lt;ref&gt;But always preceded by IF–THEN to avoid improper subtraction.&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely must a programmer write "code" with such a limited instruction set. But Minsky shows (as do Melzak and Lambek) that his machine is [[Turing complete]] with only four general ''types'' of instructions: conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment/replacement/substitution, and HALT.&lt;ref&gt;However, a few different assignment instructions (e.g. DECREMENT, INCREMENT, and ZERO/CLEAR/EMPTY for a Minsky machine) are also required for Turing-completeness; their exact specification is somewhat up to the designer. The unconditional GOTO is a convenience; it can be constructed by initializing a dedicated location to zero e.g. the instruction " Z ← 0 "; thereafter the instruction IF Z=0 THEN GOTO xxx is unconditional.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Simulation of an algorithm: computer (computor) language'': Knuth advises the reader that "the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it . . . immediately take pen and paper and work through an example".&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:4&lt;/ref&gt; But what about a simulation or execution of the real thing? The programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that the simulator/computer/computor can ''effectively'' execute. Stone gives an example of this: when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computor must know how to take a square root. If they don't, then the algorithm, to be effective, must provide a set of rules for extracting a square root.&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1972:5. Methods for extracting roots are not trivial: see [[Methods of computing square roots]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that the programmer must know a "language" that is effective relative to the target computing agent (computer/computor).

But what model should be used for the simulation? Van Emde Boas observes "even if we base [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] on abstract instead of concrete machines, arbitrariness of the choice of a model remains. It is at this point that the notion of ''simulation'' enters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Leeuwen| first = Jan| title = Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science: Algorithms and complexity. Volume A| url = https://books.google.com/?id=-X39_rA3VSQC| year = 1990| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-444-88071-0 | page = 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; When speed is being measured, the instruction set matters. For example, the subprogram in Euclid's algorithm to compute the remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a "[[modular arithmetic|modulus]]" instruction available rather than just subtraction (or worse: just Minsky's "decrement").

''Structured programming, canonical structures'': Per the [[Church–Turing thesis]], any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be [[Turing complete]], and per Minsky's demonstrations, Turing completeness requires only four instruction types—conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT. Kemeny and Kurtz observe that, while "undisciplined" use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in "[[spaghetti code]]", a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions; on the other hand "it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language".&lt;ref&gt;[[John G. Kemeny]] and [[Thomas E. Kurtz]] 1985 ''Back to Basic: The History, Corruption, and Future of the Language'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc. Reading, MA, {{ISBN|0-201-13433-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tausworthe augments the three [[Structured program theorem|Böhm-Jacopini canonical structures]]:&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1977:101&lt;/ref&gt; SEQUENCE, IF-THEN-ELSE, and WHILE-DO, with two more: DO-WHILE and CASE.&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1977:142&lt;/ref&gt; An additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends itself to [[proof of correctness|proofs of correctness]] using [[mathematical induction]].&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973 section 1.2.1, expanded by Tausworthe 1977 at pages 100ff and Chapter 9.1&lt;/ref&gt;

''Canonical flowchart symbols&lt;ref&gt;cf Tausworthe 1977&lt;/ref&gt;'': The graphical aide called a [[flowchart]], offers a way to describe and document an algorithm (and a computer program of one). Like the program flow of a Minsky machine, a flowchart always starts at the top of a page and proceeds down. Its primary symbols are only four: the directed arrow showing program flow, the rectangle (SEQUENCE, GOTO), the diamond (IF-THEN-ELSE), and the dot (OR-tie). The Böhm–Jacopini canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes. Sub-structures can "nest" in rectangles, but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure. The symbols, and their use to build the canonical structures are shown in the diagram.

==Examples==
{{further|List of algorithms}}

===Algorithm example===
[[File:Sorting quicksort anim.gif|thumb|right|An animation of the [[quicksort|quicksort algorithm]] sorting an array of randomized values. The red bars mark the pivot element; at the start of the animation, the element farthest to the right-hand side is chosen as the pivot.]]

One of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in a list of numbers of random order. Finding the solution requires looking at every number in the list. From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be stated in a high-level description of English prose, as:

''High-level description:''
# If there are no numbers in the set then there is no highest number.
# Assume the first number in the set is the largest number in the set.
# For each remaining number in the set: if this number is larger than the current largest number, consider this number to be the largest number in the set.
# When there are no numbers left in the set to iterate over, consider the current largest number to be the largest number of the set.

''(Quasi-)formal description:''
Written in prose but much closer to the high-level language of a computer program, the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in [[pseudocode]] or [[pidgin code]]:

{{algorithm-begin|name=LargestNumber}}
   Input: A list of numbers ''L''.
   Output: The largest number in the list ''L''.

   '''if''' ''L.size'' = 0 '''return''' null
   ''largest'' ← ''L''[0]
   '''for each''' ''item'' '''in''' ''L'', '''do'''
     '''if''' ''item'' &gt; ''largest'', '''then'''
       ''largest'' ← ''item''
   '''return''' ''largest''
{{algorithm-end}}

===Euclid's algorithm===
{{further|Euclid's algorithm}}
[[File:Euclid's algorithm Book VII Proposition 2 2.png|250px|thumb|left|The example-diagram of Euclid's algorithm from T.L. Heath (1908), with more detail added. Euclid does not go beyond a third measuring and gives no numerical examples. Nicomachus gives the example of 49 and 21: "I subtract the less from the greater; 28 is left; then again I subtract from this the same 21 (for this is possible); 7 is left; I subtract this from 21, 14 is left; from which I again subtract 7 (for this is possible); 7 is left, but 7 cannot be subtracted from 7." Heath comments that "The last phrase is curious, but the meaning of it is obvious enough, as also the meaning of the phrase about ending 'at one and the same number'."(Heath 1908:300).]]

[[Euclid]]'s algorithm to compute the [[greatest common divisor]] (GCD) to two numbers appears as Proposition II in Book VII ("Elementary Number Theory") of his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heath 1908:300; Hawking's Dover 2005 edition derives from Heath.&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid poses the problem thus: "Given two numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure". He defines "A number [to be] a multitude composed of units": a counting number, a positive integer not including zero. To "measure" is to place a shorter measuring length ''s'' successively (''q'' times) along longer length ''l'' until the remaining portion ''r'' is less than the shorter length ''s''.&lt;ref&gt;" 'Let CD, measuring BF, leave FA less than itself.' This is a neat abbreviation for saying, measure along BA successive lengths equal to CD until a point F is reached such that the length FA remaining is less than CD; in other words, let BF be the largest exact multiple of CD contained in BA" (Heath 1908:297)&lt;/ref&gt; In modern words, remainder ''r'' = ''l'' − ''q''×''s'', ''q'' being the quotient, or remainder ''r'' is the "modulus", the integer-fractional part left over after the division.&lt;ref&gt;For modern treatments using division in the algorithm, see Hardy and Wright 1979:180, Knuth 1973:2 (Volume 1), plus more discussion of Euclid's algorithm in Knuth 1969:293–297 (Volume 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Euclid's method to succeed, the starting lengths must satisfy two requirements: (i) the lengths must not be zero, AND (ii) the subtraction must be “proper”; i.e., a test must guarantee that the smaller of the two numbers is subtracted from the larger (alternately, the two can be equal so their subtraction yields zero).

Euclid's original proof adds a third requirement: the two lengths must not be prime to one another. Euclid stipulated this so that he could construct a [[reductio ad absurdum]] proof that the two numbers' common measure is in fact the ''greatest''.&lt;ref&gt;Euclid covers this question in his Proposition 1.&lt;/ref&gt; While Nicomachus' algorithm is the same as Euclid's, when the numbers are prime to one another, it yields the number "1" for their common measure. So, to be precise, the following is really Nicomachus' algorithm.

[[File:Euclids-algorithm-example-1599-650.gif|350px|thumb|right|A graphical expression of Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest common divisor for 1599 and 650.
&lt;source lang="text" highlight="1,5"&gt;
 1599 = 650×2 + 299
 650 = 299×2 + 52
 299 = 52×5 + 39
 52 = 39×1 + 13
 39 = 13×3 + 0&lt;/source&gt;]]

====Computer language for Euclid's algorithm====
Only a few instruction ''types'' are required to execute Euclid's algorithm—some logical tests (conditional GOTO), unconditional GOTO, assignment (replacement), and subtraction.
* A ''location'' is symbolized by upper case letter(s), e.g. S, A, etc.
* The varying quantity (number) in a location is written in lower case letter(s) and (usually) associated with the location's name. For example, location L at the start might contain the number ''l'' = 3009.

====An inelegant program for Euclid's algorithm====
[[File:Euclid's algorithm Inelegant program 1.png|thumb|163px|right|"Inelegant" is a translation of Knuth's version of the algorithm with a subtraction-based remainder-loop replacing his use of division (or a "modulus" instruction). Derived from Knuth 1973:2–4. Depending on the two numbers "Inelegant" may compute the g.c.d. in fewer steps than "Elegant".]]

The following algorithm is framed as Knuth's four-step version of Euclid's and Nicomachus', but, rather than using division to find the remainder, it uses successive subtractions of the shorter length ''s'' from the remaining length ''r'' until ''r'' is less than ''s''. The high-level description, shown in boldface, is adapted from Knuth 1973:2–4:

'''INPUT''':
 {{vanchor|1|el1}} [Into two locations L and S put the numbers ''l'' and ''s'' that represent the two lengths]:
   INPUT L, S
 {{vanchor|2|el2}} [Initialize R: make the remaining length ''r'' equal to the starting/initial/input length ''l'']:
   R ← L

'''E0: [Ensure ''r'' ≥ ''s''.]'''
 {{vanchor|3|el3}} [Ensure the smaller of the two numbers is in S and the larger in R]:
   IF R &gt; S THEN
     the contents of L is the larger number so skip over the exchange-steps [[#4|4]], [[#5|5]] and [[#6|6]]:
     GOTO step [[#6|6]]
   ELSE
     swap the contents of R and S.
 {{vanchor|4|el4}}   L ← R (this first step is redundant, but is useful for later discussion).
 {{vanchor|5|el5}}   R ← S
 {{vanchor|6|el6}}   S ← L

'''E1: [Find remainder]''': Until the remaining length ''r'' in R is less than the shorter length ''s'' in S, repeatedly subtract the measuring number ''s'' in S from the remaining length ''r'' in R.
 {{vanchor|7|el7}} IF S &gt; R THEN
     done measuring so
     GOTO [[#10|10]]
   ELSE
     measure again,
 {{vanchor|8|el8}}   R ← R − S
 {{vanchor|9|el9}}   [Remainder-loop]:
     GOTO [[#7|7]].

'''E2: [Is the remainder zero?]''': EITHER (i) the last measure was exact, the remainder in R is zero, and the program can halt, OR (ii) the algorithm must continue: the last measure left a remainder in R less than measuring number in S.
 {{vanchor|10|el10}} IF R = 0 THEN
      done so
      GOTO [[#15|step 15]]
    ELSE
      CONTINUE TO [[#11|step 11]],

'''E3: [Interchange ''s'' and ''r'']''': The nut of Euclid's algorithm. Use remainder ''r'' to measure what was previously smaller number ''s''; L serves as a temporary location.
 {{vanchor|11|el11}}  L ← R
 {{vanchor|12|el12}}  R ← S
 {{vanchor|13|el13}}  S ← L
 {{vanchor|14|el14}}  [Repeat the measuring process]:
     GOTO [[#7|7]]

'''OUTPUT''':

 {{vanchor|15|el15}} [Done. S contains the [[greatest common divisor]]]:
    PRINT S

'''DONE''':
 {{vanchor|16|el16}} HALT, END, STOP.

====An elegant program for Euclid's algorithm====
The following version of Euclid's algorithm requires only six core instructions to do what thirteen are required to do by "Inelegant"; worse, "Inelegant" requires more ''types'' of instructions. The flowchart of "Elegant" can be found at the top of this article. In the (unstructured) Basic language, the steps are numbered, and the instruction &lt;source lang="cbmbas" inline&gt;LET [] = []&lt;/source&gt; is the assignment instruction symbolized by ←.
&lt;source lang="cbmbas"&gt;
  5 REM Euclid's algorithm for greatest common divisor
  6 PRINT "Type two integers greater than 0"
  10 INPUT A,B
  20 IF B=0 THEN GOTO 80
  30 IF A &gt; B THEN GOTO 60
  40 LET B=B-A
  50 GOTO 20
  60 LET A=A-B
  70 GOTO 20
  80 PRINT A
  90 END
&lt;/source&gt;
The following version can be used with Object Oriented languages:
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
// Euclid's algorithm for greatest common divisor
integer euclidAlgorithm (int A, int B){
     A=Math.abs(A);
     B=Math.abs(B);
     while (B!=0){
          if (A&gt;B) A=A-B;
          else B=B-A;
     }
     return A;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
''How "Elegant" works'': In place of an outer "Euclid loop", "Elegant" shifts back and forth between two "co-loops", an A &gt; B loop that computes A ← A − B, and a B ≤ A loop that computes B ← B − A. This works because, when at last the minuend M is less than or equal to the subtrahend S ( Difference = Minuend − Subtrahend), the minuend can become ''s'' (the new measuring length) and the subtrahend can become the new ''r'' (the length to be measured); in other words the "sense" of the subtraction reverses.

===Testing the Euclid algorithms===
Does an algorithm do what its author wants it to do? A few test cases usually suffice to confirm core functionality. One source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVII/propVII2.html |title=Euclid's Elements, Book VII, Proposition 2 |publisher=Aleph0.clarku.edu |date= |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses 3009 and 884. Knuth suggested 40902, 24140. Another interesting case is the two [[relatively prime]] numbers 14157 and 5950.

But exceptional cases must be identified and tested. Will "Inelegant" perform properly when R &gt; S, S &gt; R, R = S? Ditto for "Elegant": B &gt; A, A &gt; B, A = B? (Yes to all). What happens when one number is zero, both numbers are zero? ("Inelegant" computes forever in all cases; "Elegant" computes forever when A = 0.) What happens if ''negative'' numbers are entered? Fractional numbers? If the input numbers, i.e. the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the function computed by the algorithm/program, is to include only positive integers including zero, then the failures at zero indicate that the algorithm (and the program that [[instance (computer science)|instantiates]] it) is a [[partial function]] rather than a [[total function]]. A notable failure due to exceptions is the [[Ariane 5 Flight 501]] rocket failure (June 4, 1996).

''Proof of program correctness by use of mathematical induction'': Knuth demonstrates the application of [[mathematical induction]] to an "extended" version of Euclid's algorithm, and he proposes "a general method applicable to proving the validity of any algorithm".&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:13–18. He credits "the formulation of algorithm-proving in terms of assertions and induction" to R. W. Floyd, Peter Naur, C. A. R. Hoare, H. H. Goldstine and J. von Neumann. Tausworth 1977 borrows Knuth's Euclid example and extends Knuth's method in section 9.1 ''Formal Proofs'' (pages 288–298).&lt;/ref&gt; Tausworthe proposes that a measure of the complexity of a program be the length of its correctness proof.&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1997:294&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measuring and improving the Euclid algorithms===
''Elegance (compactness) versus goodness (speed)'': With only six core instructions, "Elegant" is the clear winner, compared to "Inelegant" at thirteen instructions. However, "Inelegant" is ''faster'' (it arrives at HALT in fewer steps). [[Algorithm analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;cf Knuth 1973:7 (Vol. I), and his more-detailed analyses on pp. 1969:294–313 (Vol II).&lt;/ref&gt; indicates why this is the case: "Elegant" does ''two'' conditional tests in every subtraction loop, whereas "Inelegant" only does one. As the algorithm (usually) requires many loop-throughs, ''on average'' much time is wasted doing a "B = 0?" test that is needed only after the remainder is computed.

''Can the algorithms be improved?'': Once the programmer judges a program "fit" and "effective"—that is, it computes the function intended by its author—then the question becomes, can it be improved?

The compactness of "Inelegant" can be improved by the elimination of five steps. But Chaitin proved that compacting an algorithm cannot be automated by a generalized algorithm;&lt;ref&gt;Breakdown occurs when an algorithm tries to compact itself. Success would solve the [[Halting problem]].&lt;/ref&gt; rather, it can only be done [[heuristic]]ally; i.e., by exhaustive search (examples to be found at [[Busy beaver]]), trial and error, cleverness, insight, application of [[inductive reasoning]], etc. Observe that steps 4, 5 and 6 are repeated in steps 11, 12 and 13. Comparison with "Elegant" provides a hint that these steps, together with steps 2 and 3, can be eliminated. This reduces the number of core instructions from thirteen to eight, which makes it "more elegant" than "Elegant", at nine steps.

The speed of "Elegant" can be improved by moving the "B=0?" test outside of the two subtraction loops. This change calls for the addition of three instructions (B = 0?, A = 0?, GOTO). Now "Elegant" computes the example-numbers faster; whether this is always the case for any given A, B, and R, S would require a detailed analysis.

==Algorithmic analysis==
{{Main|Analysis of algorithms}}
It is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm. Methods have been developed for the [[analysis of algorithms]] to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O(''n''), using the [[big O notation]] with ''n'' as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore, it is said to have a space requirement of ''O(1)'', if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O(''n'') if it is counted.

Different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or '[[algorithmic efficiency|effort]]' than others. For example, a [[binary search]] algorithm (with cost O(log n) ) outperforms a sequential search (cost O(n) ) when used for [[lookup table|table lookups]] on sorted lists or arrays.

===Formal versus empirical===
{{Main|Empirical algorithmics|Profiling (computer programming)|Program optimization}}
The [[analysis of algorithms|analysis, and study of algorithms]] is a discipline of [[computer science]], and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific [[programming language]] or implementation. In this sense, algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not on the specifics of any particular implementation. Usually [[pseudocode]] is used for analysis as it is the simplest and most general representation. However, ultimately, most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardware/software platforms and their [[algorithmic efficiency]] is eventually put to the test using real code. For the solution of a "one off" problem, the efficiency of a particular algorithm may not have significant consequences (unless n is extremely large) but for algorithms designed for fast interactive, commercial or long life scientific usage it may be critical. Scaling from small n to large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign.

Empirical testing is useful because it may uncover unexpected interactions that affect performance. [[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmarks]] may be used to compare before/after potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization.
Empirical tests cannot replace formal analysis, though, and are not trivial to perform in a fair manner.&lt;ref name="KriegelSchubert2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kriegel|first1=Hans-Peter|authorlink=Hans-Peter Kriegel|last2=Schubert|first2=Erich|last3=Zimek|first3=Arthur|authorlink3=Arthur Zimek|title=The (black) art of run-time evaluation: Are we comparing algorithms or implementations?|journal=Knowledge and Information Systems|volume=52|issue=2|year=2016|pages=341–378|issn=0219-1377|doi=10.1007/s10115-016-1004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Execution efficiency ===
{{Main|Algorithmic efficiency}}
To illustrate the potential improvements possible even in well-established algorithms, a recent significant innovation, relating to [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] algorithms (used heavily in the field of image processing), can decrease processing time up to 1,000 times for applications like medical imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Better Math Makes Faster Data Networks| author=Gillian Conahan| date=January 2013| url=http://discovermagazine.com/2013/jan-feb/34-better-math-makes-faster-data-networks#.URAnVieX98F| publisher=discovermagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, speed improvements depend on special properties of the problem, which are very common in practical applications.&lt;ref name="Hassanieh12"&gt;Haitham Hassanieh, [[Piotr Indyk]], Dina Katabi, and Eric Price, "[http://siam.omnibooksonline.com/2012SODA/data/papers/500.pdf ACM-SIAM Symposium On Discrete Algorithms (SODA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704180806/http://siam.omnibooksonline.com/2012SODA/data/papers/500.pdf |date=July 4, 2013 }}, Kyoto, January 2012. See also the [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/sFFT/ sFFT Web Page].&lt;/ref&gt; Speedups of this magnitude enable computing devices that make extensive use of image processing (like digital cameras and medical equipment) to consume less power.

== Classification ==
There are various ways to classify algorithms, each with its own merits.

=== By implementation ===
One way to classify algorithms is by implementation means.

; Recursion
: A [[recursive algorithm]] is one that invokes (makes reference to) itself repeatedly until a certain condition (also known as termination condition) matches, which is a method common to [[functional programming]]. [[Iteration|Iterative]] algorithms use repetitive constructs like [[Program loops|loops]] and sometimes additional data structures like [[Stack (data structure)|stacks]] to solve the given problems. Some problems are naturally suited for one implementation or the other. For example, [[towers of Hanoi]] is well understood using recursive implementation. Every recursive version has an equivalent (but possibly more or less complex) iterative version, and vice versa.
; Logical
: An algorithm may be viewed as controlled [[Deductive reasoning|logical deduction]]. This notion may be expressed as: ''Algorithm = logic + control''.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The logic component expresses the axioms that may be used in the computation and the control component determines the way in which deduction is applied to the axioms. This is the basis for the [[logic programming]] paradigm. In pure logic programming languages, the control component is fixed and algorithms are specified by supplying only the logic component. The appeal of this approach is the elegant [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]]: a change in the axioms produces a well-defined change in the algorithm.
; Serial, parallel or distributed
: Algorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time. Those computers are sometimes called serial computers. An [[algorithm design]]ed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm, as opposed to [[parallel algorithm]]s or [[distributed algorithms]]. Parallel algorithms take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on a problem at the same time, whereas distributed algorithms utilize multiple machines connected with a [[computer network]]. Parallel or distributed algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and collect the results back together. The resource consumption in such algorithms is not only processor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the processors. Some sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently, but their communication overhead is expensive. Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable. Some problems have no parallel algorithms and are called inherently serial problems.
; Deterministic or non-deterministic
: [[Deterministic algorithm]]s solve the problem with exact decision at every step of the algorithm whereas [[non-deterministic algorithm]]s solve problems via guessing although typical guesses are made more accurate through the use of [[heuristics]].
; Exact or approximate
: While many algorithms reach an exact solution, [[approximation algorithm]]s seek an approximation that is closer to the true solution. The approximation can be reached by either using a deterministic or a random strategy. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems. One of the examples of an approximate algorithm is the [[Knapsack problem]]. The Knapsack problem is a problem where there is a set of given items. The goal of the problem is to pack the knapsack to get the maximum total value. Each item has some weight and some value. Total weight that we can carry is no more than some fixed number X. So, we must consider weights of items as well as their value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540402862|title=Knapsack Problems {{!}} Hans Kellerer {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Quantum algorithm]]
: They run on a realistic model of [[quantum computation]]. The term is usually used for those algorithms which seem inherently quantum, or use some essential feature of [[Quantum computing]] such as [[quantum superposition]] or [[quantum entanglement]].

=== By design paradigm ===
Another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. There is a certain number of paradigms, each different from the other. Furthermore, each of these categories includes many different types of algorithms. Some common paradigms are:

; [[Brute force search|Brute-force]] or exhaustive search
: This is the naive method of trying every possible solution to see which is best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Carroll| first1 = Sue| last2 = Daughtrey| first2 = Taz| title = Fundamental Concepts for the Software Quality Engineer| url = https://books.google.com/?id=bz_cl3B05IcC&amp;pg=PA282| date = July 4, 2007| publisher = American Society for Quality| isbn = 978-0-87389-720-4| pages = 282 et seq. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Divide and conquer
: A [[divide and conquer algorithm]] repeatedly reduces an instance of a problem to one or more smaller instances of the same problem (usually [[recursion|recursively]]) until the instances are small enough to solve easily. One such example of divide and conquer is [[mergesort|merge sorting]]. Sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in the conquer phase by merging the segments. A simpler variant of divide and conquer is called a ''decrease and conquer algorithm'', that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem. Divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so the conquer stage is more complex than decrease and conquer algorithms. An example of the decrease and conquer algorithm is the [[binary search algorithm]].
; Search and enumeration
: Many problems (such as playing [[chess]]) can be modeled as problems on [[graph theory|graphs]]. A [[graph exploration algorithm]] specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems. This category also includes [[search algorithm]]s, [[branch and bound]] enumeration and [[backtracking]].
;[[Randomized algorithm]]
: Such algorithms make some choices randomly (or pseudo-randomly). They can be very useful in finding approximate solutions for problems where finding exact solutions can be impractical (see heuristic method below). For some of these problems, it is known that the fastest approximations must involve some [[randomness]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the [[volume]] of a [[convex polytope]] (described using a membership oracle) can be approximated to high accuracy by a randomized polynomial time algorithm, but not by a deterministic one: see {{citation

# [[Monte Carlo algorithm]]s return a correct answer with high-probability. E.g. [[RP (complexity)|RP]] is the subclass of these that run in [[polynomial time]].
# [[Las Vegas algorithm]]s always return the correct answer, but their running time is only probabilistically bound, e.g. [[Zero-error Probabilistic Polynomial time|ZPP]].
; [[Reduction (complexity)|Reduction of complexity]]
: This technique involves solving a difficult problem by transforming it into a better-known problem for which we have (hopefully) [[asymptotically optimal]] algorithms. The goal is to find a reducing algorithm whose [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithm's. For example, one [[selection algorithm]] for finding the median in an unsorted list involves first sorting the list (the expensive portion) and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list (the cheap portion). This technique is also known as ''[[Transform and conquer algorithm|transform and conquer]]''.
; [[Back tracking]]
: In this approach, multiple solutions are built incrementally and abandoned when it is determined that they cannot lead to a valid full solution.

=== Optimization problems ===

For [[optimization problem]]s there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following:

; [[Linear programming]]
: When searching for optimal solutions to a linear function bound to linear equality and inequality constraints, the constraints of the problem can be used directly in producing the optimal solutions. There are algorithms that can solve any problem in this category, such as the popular [[simplex algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;
[[George B. Dantzig]] and Mukund N. Thapa. 2003. ''Linear Programming 2: Theory and Extensions''. Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Problems that can be solved with linear programming include the [[maximum flow problem]] for directed graphs. If a problem additionally requires that one or more of the unknowns must be an [[integer]] then it is classified in [[integer programming]]. A linear programming algorithm can solve such a problem if it can be proved that all restrictions for integer values are superficial, i.e., the solutions satisfy these restrictions anyway. In the general case, a specialized algorithm or an algorithm that finds approximate solutions is used, depending on the difficulty of the problem.
; [[Dynamic programming]]
: When a problem shows [[optimal substructure]]s – meaning the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems – and [[overlapping subproblems]], meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, a quicker approach called ''dynamic programming'' avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed. For example, [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]], the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. Dynamic programming and [[memoization]] go together. The main difference between dynamic programming and divide and conquer is that subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer, whereas subproblems overlap in dynamic programming. The difference between dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls. When subproblems are independent and there is no repetition, memoization does not help; hence dynamic programming is not a solution for all complex problems. By using memoization or maintaining a [[Mathematical table|table]] of subproblems already solved, dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity.
; The greedy method
: A [[greedy algorithm]] is similar to a dynamic programming algorithm in that it works by examining substructures, in this case not of the problem but of a given solution. Such algorithms start with some solution, which may be given or have been constructed in some way, and improve it by making small modifications. For some problems they can find the optimal solution while for others they stop at [[local optimum|local optima]], that is, at solutions that cannot be improved by the algorithm but are not optimum. The most popular use of greedy algorithms is for finding the minimal spanning tree where finding the optimal solution is possible with this method. [[Huffman coding|Huffman Tree]], [[kruskal's algorithm|Kruskal]], [[Prim's algorithm|Prim]], [[Sollin's algorithm|Sollin]] are greedy algorithms that can solve this optimization problem.
;The heuristic method
:In [[optimization problem]]s, [[heuristic algorithm]]s can be used to find a solution close to the optimal solution in cases where finding the optimal solution is impractical. These algorithms work by getting closer and closer to the optimal solution as they progress. In principle, if run for an infinite amount of time, they will find the optimal solution. Their merit is that they can find a solution very close to the optimal solution in a relatively short time. Such algorithms include [[local search (optimization)|local search]], [[tabu search]], [[simulated annealing]], and [[genetic algorithm]]s. Some of them, like simulated annealing, are non-deterministic algorithms while others, like tabu search, are deterministic. When a bound on the error of the non-optimal solution is known, the algorithm is further categorized as an [[approximation algorithm]].

=== By field of study ===
{{See also|List of algorithms}}
Every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms. Related problems in one field are often studied together. Some example classes are [[search algorithm]]s, [[sorting algorithm]]s, [[merge algorithm]]s, [[numerical analysis|numerical algorithms]], [[graph theory|graph algorithms]], [[string algorithms]], [[computational geometry|computational geometric algorithms]], [[combinatorial|combinatorial algorithms]], [[medical algorithm]]s, [[machine learning]], [[cryptography]], [[data compression]] algorithms and [[parsing|parsing techniques]].

Fields tend to overlap with each other, and algorithm advances in one field may improve those of other, sometimes completely unrelated, fields. For example, dynamic programming was invented for optimization of resource consumption in industry but is now used in solving a broad range of problems in many fields.

=== By complexity ===
{{See also|Complexity class| Parameterized complexity}}
Algorithms can be classified by the amount of time they need to complete compared to their input size:

* Constant time: if the time needed by the algorithm is the same, regardless of the input size. E.g. an access to an [[Array data structure|array]] element.
* Linear time: if the time is proportional to the input size. E.g. the traverse of a list.
* Logarithmic time: if the time is a logarithmic function of the input size. E.g. [[binary search algorithm]].
* Polynomial time: if the time is a power of the input size. E.g. the [[bubble sort]] algorithm has quadratic time complexity.
* Exponential time: if the time is an exponential function of the input size. E.g. [[Brute-force search]].

Some problems may have multiple algorithms of differing complexity, while other problems might have no algorithms or no known efficient algorithms. There are also mappings from some problems to other problems. Owing to this, it was found to be more suitable to classify the problems themselves instead of the algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity of the best possible algorithms for them.

== Continuous algorithms ==
The adjective "continuous" when applied to the word "algorithm" can mean:
* An algorithm operating on data that represents continuous quantities, even though this data is represented by discrete approximations—such algorithms are studied in [[numerical analysis]]; or
* An algorithm in the form of a [[differential equation]] that operates continuously on the data, running on an [[analog computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Tsypkin| title = Adaptation and learning in automatic systems| url = https://books.google.com/?id=sgDHJlafMskC&amp;pg=PA54| year = 1971| publisher = Academic Press| isbn = 978-0-08-095582-7| page = 54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues ==
{{see also|Software patent}}

Algorithms, by themselves, are not usually patentable. In the United States, a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute "processes" (USPTO 2006), and hence algorithms are not patentable (as in [[Gottschalk v. Benson]]). However practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in [[Diamond v. Diehr]], the application of a simple [[feedback]] algorithm to aid in the curing of [[synthetic rubber]] was deemed patentable. The [[Software patent debate|patenting of software]] is highly controversial, and there are highly criticized patents involving algorithms, especially [[data compression]] algorithms, such as [[Unisys]]' [[Graphics Interchange Format#Unisys and LZW patent enforcement|LZW patent]].

Additionally, some cryptographic algorithms have export restrictions (see [[export of cryptography]]).

== History: Development of the notion of "algorithm" ==

=== Ancient Near East ===
Algorithms were used in ancient Greece. Two examples are the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]], which was described in [[Introduction to Arithmetic]] by [[Nicomachus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.wichita.edu/history/men/eratosthenes.html|title=Eratosthenes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooke2005/&gt;{{rp|Ch 9.2}} and the [[Euclidean algorithm]], which was first described in [[Euclid's Elements]] (c. 300 BC).&lt;ref name=Cooke2005/&gt;{{rp|Ch 9.1}} [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian clay tablets]] describe and employ algorithmic procedures to compute the time and place of significant astronomical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Aaboe | first = Asger | author-link = Asger Aaboe | date = 2001 | title = Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy | publisher = Springer | place = New York | pages = 40–62 | isbn = 0-387-95136-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discrete and distinguishable symbols ===
'''Tally-marks''': To keep track of their flocks, their sacks of grain and their money the ancients used tallying: accumulating stones or marks scratched on sticks or making discrete symbols in clay. Through the Babylonian and Egyptian use of marks and symbols, eventually [[Roman numerals]] and the [[abacus]] evolved (Dilson, p.&amp;nbsp;16–41). Tally marks appear prominently in [[unary numeral system]] arithmetic used in [[Turing machine]] and [[Post–Turing machine]] computations.

=== Manipulation of symbols as "place holders" for numbers: algebra ===
The work of the ancient [[Greek mathematics|Greek geometers]] ([[Euclidean algorithm]]), the [[List of Indian mathematicians|Indian mathematician]] [[Brahmagupta]], and the [[List of Iranian mathematicians|Persian mathematician]] [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Al-Khwarizmi]] (from whose name the terms "[[algorism]]" and "algorithm" are derived), and Western European mathematicians culminated in [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s notion of the [[calculus ratiocinator]] (ca 1680):
{{quote|A good century and a half ahead of his time, Leibniz proposed an algebra of logic, an algebra that would specify the rules for manipulating logical concepts in the manner that ordinary algebra specifies the rules for manipulating numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000:18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Mechanical contrivances with discrete states ===
''The clock'': Bolter credits the invention of the weight-driven [[clock]] as "The key invention [of Europe in the Middle Ages]", in particular, the [[verge escapement]]&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:24&lt;/ref&gt; that provides us with the tick and tock of a mechanical clock. "The accurate automatic machine"&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:26&lt;/ref&gt; led immediately to "mechanical [[automata theory|automata]]" beginning in the 13th century and finally to "computational machines"—the [[difference engine]] and [[analytical engine]]s of [[Charles Babbage]] and Countess [[Ada Lovelace]], mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:33–34, 204–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelace is credited with the first creation of an algorithm intended for processing on a computer – Babbage's analytical engine, the first device considered a real [[Turing-complete]] computer instead of just a [[calculator]] – and is sometimes called "history's first programmer" as a result, though a full implementation of Babbage's second device would not be realized until decades after her lifetime.

''Logical machines 1870—[[Stanley Jevons]]' "logical abacus" and "logical machine"'': The technical problem was to reduce [[Boolean equation]]s when presented in a form similar to what is now known as [[Karnaugh map]]s. Jevons (1880) describes first a simple "abacus" of "slips of wood furnished with pins, contrived so that any part or class of the [logical] combinations can be picked out mechanically . . . More recently, however, I have reduced the system to a completely mechanical form, and have thus embodied the whole of the indirect process of inference in what may be called a ''Logical Machine''" His machine came equipped with "certain moveable wooden rods" and "at the foot are 21 keys like those of a piano [etc] . . .". With this machine he could analyze a "[[syllogism]] or any other simple logical argument".&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from W. Stanley Jevons 1880 ''Elementary Lessons in Logic: Deductive and Inductive'', Macmillan and Co., London and New York. Republished as a googlebook; cf Jevons 1880:199–201. Louis Couturat 1914 ''the Algebra of Logic'', The Open Court Publishing Company, Chicago and London. Republished as a googlebook; cf Couturat 1914:75–76 gives a few more details; he compares this to a typewriter as well as a piano. Jevons states that the account is to be found at January 20, 1870 ''The Proceedings of the Royal Society''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This machine he displayed in 1870 before the Fellows of the Royal Society.&lt;ref&gt;Jevons 1880:199–200&lt;/ref&gt; Another logician [[John Venn]], however, in his 1881 ''Symbolic Logic'', turned a jaundiced eye to this effort: "I have no high estimate myself of the interest or importance of what are sometimes called logical machines ... it does not seem to me that any contrivances at present known or likely to be discovered really deserve the name of logical machines"; see more at [[Algorithm characterizations]]. But not to be outdone he too presented "a plan somewhat analogous, I apprehend, to Prof. Jevon's ''abacus'' ... [And] [a]gain, corresponding to Prof. Jevons's logical machine, the following contrivance may be described. I prefer to call it merely a logical-diagram machine ... but I suppose that it could do very completely all that can be rationally expected of any logical machine".&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from John Venn 1881 ''Symbolic Logic'', Macmillan and Co., London. Republished as a googlebook. cf Venn 1881:120–125. The interested reader can find a deeper explanation in those pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jacquard loom, Hollerith punch cards, telegraphy and telephony—the electromechanical relay'': Bell and Newell (1971) indicate that the [[Jacquard loom]] (1801), precursor to [[Hollerith cards]] (punch cards, 1887), and "telephone switching technologies" were the roots of a tree leading to the development of the first computers.&lt;ref&gt;Bell and Newell diagram 1971:39, cf. Davis 2000&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century the [[telegraph]], the precursor of the telephone, was in use throughout the world, it's discrete and distinguishable encoding of letters as "dots and dashes" a common sound. By the late 19th century the [[ticker tape]] (ca 1870s) was in use, as was the use of Hollerith cards in the 1890 U.S. census. Then came the [[teleprinter]] (ca. 1910) with its punched-paper use of [[Baudot code]] on tape.

''Telephone-switching networks'' of electromechanical [[relay]]s (invented 1835) was behind the work of [[George Stibitz]] (1937), the inventor of the digital adding device. As he worked in Bell Laboratories, he observed the "burdensome' use of mechanical calculators with gears. "He went home one evening in 1937 intending to test his idea... When the tinkering was over, Stibitz had constructed a binary adding device".&lt;ref&gt;* Melina Hill, Valley News Correspondent, ''A Tinkerer Gets a Place in History'', Valley News West Lebanon NH, Thursday, March 31, 1983, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis (2000) observes the particular importance of the electromechanical relay (with its two "binary states" ''open'' and ''closed''):
: It was only with the development, beginning in the 1930s, of electromechanical calculators using electrical relays, that machines were built having the scope Babbage had envisioned."&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000:14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics during the 19th century up to the mid-20th century ===
''Symbols and rules'': In rapid succession, the mathematics of [[George Boole]] (1847, 1854), [[Gottlob Frege]] (1879), and [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1888–1889) reduced arithmetic to a sequence of symbols manipulated by rules. Peano's ''The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method'' (1888) was "the first attempt at an axiomatization of mathematics in a symbolic language".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:81ff&lt;/ref&gt;

But Heijenoort gives Frege (1879) this kudos: Frege's is "perhaps the most important single work ever written in logic. ... in which we see a " 'formula language', that is a ''lingua characterica'', a language written with special symbols, "for pure thought", that is, free from rhetorical embellishments ... constructed from specific symbols that are manipulated according to definite rules".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary on Frege's ''Begriffsschrift, a formula language, modeled upon that of arithmetic, for pure thought'' in van Heijenoort 1967:1&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Frege was further simplified and amplified by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] in their [[Principia Mathematica]] (1910–1913).

''The paradoxes'': At the same time a number of disturbing paradoxes appeared in the literature, in particular, the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] (1897), the [[Russell paradox]] (1902–03), and the [[Richard Paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1906, cf. Kleene 1952:36–40&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant considerations led to [[Kurt Gödel]]'s paper (1931)—he specifically cites the paradox of the liar—that completely reduces rules of [[recursion]] to numbers.

''Effective calculability'': In an effort to solve the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] defined precisely by Hilbert in 1928, mathematicians first set about to define what was meant by an "effective method" or "effective calculation" or "effective calculability" (i.e., a calculation that would succeed). In rapid succession the following appeared: [[Alonzo Church]], [[Stephen Kleene]] and [[J. B. Rosser]]'s [[λ-calculus]]&lt;ref&gt;cf. footnote in Alonzo Church 1936a in Davis 1965:90 and 1936b in Davis 1965:110&lt;/ref&gt; a finely honed definition of "general recursion" from the work of Gödel acting on suggestions of [[Jacques Herbrand]] (cf. Gödel's Princeton lectures of 1934) and subsequent simplifications by Kleene.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1935–6 in Davis 1965:237ff, Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:255ff&lt;/ref&gt; Church's proof&lt;ref&gt;Church 1936 in Davis 1965:88ff&lt;/ref&gt; that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable, [[Emil Post]]'s definition of effective calculability as a worker mindlessly following a list of instructions to move left or right through a sequence of rooms and while there either mark or erase a paper or observe the paper and make a yes-no decision about the next instruction.&lt;ref&gt;cf. "Finite Combinatory Processes&amp;mdash;formulation 1", Post 1936 in Davis 1965:289–290&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Turing's proof of that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable by use of his "a- [automatic-] machine"&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:116ff&lt;/ref&gt;—in effect almost identical to Post's "formulation", [[J. Barkley Rosser]]'s definition of "effective method" in terms of "a machine".&lt;ref&gt;Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:226&lt;/ref&gt; [[S. C. Kleene]]'s proposal of a precursor to "[[Church thesis]]" that he called "Thesis I",&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:273–274&lt;/ref&gt; and a few years later Kleene's renaming his Thesis "Church's Thesis"&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:300, 317&lt;/ref&gt; and proposing "Turing's Thesis".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:376&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emil Post (1936) and Alan Turing (1936–37, 1939) ===
Here is a remarkable coincidence{{According to whom|date=March 2017}} of two men not knowing each other but describing a process of men-as-computers working on computations—and they yield virtually identical definitions.

[[Emil Post]] (1936) described the actions of a "computer" (human being) as follows:
:"...two concepts are involved: that of a ''symbol space'' in which the work leading from problem to answer is to be carried out, and a fixed unalterable ''set of directions''.

His symbol space would be
:"a two-way infinite sequence of spaces or boxes... The problem solver or worker is to move and work in this symbol space, being capable of being in, and operating in but one box at a time.... a box is to admit of but two possible conditions, i.e., being empty or unmarked, and having a single mark in it, say a vertical stroke.

:"One box is to be singled out and called the starting point. ...a specific problem is to be given in symbolic form by a finite number of boxes [i.e., INPUT] being marked with a stroke. Likewise, the answer [i.e., OUTPUT] is to be given in symbolic form by such a configuration of marked boxes...

:"A set of directions applicable to a general problem sets up a deterministic process when applied to each specific problem. This process terminates only when it comes to the direction of type (C ) [i.e., STOP]".&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:289–290&lt;/ref&gt; See more at [[Post–Turing machine]]

[[Alan Turing]]'s work&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936 in Davis 1965, Turing 1939 in Davis 1965:160&lt;/ref&gt; preceded that of Stibitz (1937); it is unknown whether Stibitz knew of the work of Turing. Turing's biographer believed that Turing's use of a typewriter-like model derived from a youthful interest: "Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; Mrs. Turing had a typewriter, and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'".&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, p.&amp;nbsp;96&lt;/ref&gt; Given the prevalence of Morse code and telegraphy, ticker tape machines, and teletypewriters we{{Who|date=March 2017}} might conjecture that all were influences.

Turing—his model of computation is now called a [[Turing machine]]—begins, as did Post, with an analysis of a human computer that he whittles down to a simple set of basic motions and "states of mind". But he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7:116&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper. We may suppose this paper is divided into squares like a child's arithmetic book...I assume then that the computation is carried out on one-dimensional paper, i.e., on a tape divided into squares. I shall also suppose that the number of symbols which may be printed is finite...

:"The behavior of the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is observing, and his "state of mind" at that moment. We may suppose that there is a bound B to the number of symbols or squares which the computer can observe at one moment. If he wishes to observe more, he must use successive observations. We will also suppose that the number of states of mind which need be taken into account is finite...

:"Let us imagine that the operations performed by the computer to be split up into 'simple operations' which are so elementary that it is not easy to imagine them further divided."&lt;ref name="Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136"&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing's reduction yields the following:
:"The simple operations must therefore include:
::"(a) Changes of the symbol on one of the observed squares
::"(b) Changes of one of the squares observed to another square within L squares of one of the previously observed squares.
"It may be that some of these change necessarily invoke a change of state of mind. The most general single operation must, therefore, be taken to be one of the following:
::"(A) A possible change (a) of symbol together with a possible change of state of mind.
::"(B) A possible change (b) of observed squares, together with a possible change of state of mind"

:"We may now construct a machine to do the work of this computer."&lt;ref name="Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136"/&gt;

A few years later, Turing expanded his analysis (thesis, definition) with this forceful expression of it:
:"A function is said to be "effectively calculable" if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process. Though it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite, mathematical expressible definition . . . [he discusses the history of the definition pretty much as presented above with respect to Gödel, Herbrand, Kleene, Church, Turing, and Post] . . . We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to the author's definition of a computable function, and to an identification of computability † with effective calculability . . . .
::"† We shall use the expression "computable function" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let "effectively calculable" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions".&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1939 in Davis 1965:160&lt;/ref&gt;

=== J. B. Rosser (1939) and S. C. Kleene (1943) ===
[[J. Barkley Rosser]] defined an 'effective [mathematical] method' in the following manner (italicization added):
:"'Effective method' is used here in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely determined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps. With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date. [his footnote #5; see discussion immediately below]. The simplest of these to state (due to Post and Turing) says essentially that ''an effective method of solving certain sets of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer''. All three definitions are equivalent, so it doesn't matter which one is used. Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one." (Rosser 1939:225–6)

Rosser's footnote No. 5 references the work of (1) Church and Kleene and their definition of λ-definability, in particular Church's use of it in his ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' (1936); (2) Herbrand and Gödel and their use of recursion in particular Gödel's use in his famous paper ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I'' (1931); and (3) Post (1936) and Turing (1936–37) in their mechanism-models of computation.

[[Stephen C. Kleene]] defined as his now-famous "Thesis I" known as the [[Church–Turing thesis]]. But he did this in the following context (boldface in original):
:"12. ''Algorithmic theories''... In setting up a complete algorithmic theory, what we do is to describe a procedure, performable for each set of values of the independent variables, which procedure necessarily terminates and in such manner that from the outcome we can read a definite answer, "yes" or "no," to the question, "is the predicate value true?"" (Kleene 1943:273)

=== History after 1950 ===
A number of efforts have been directed toward further refinement of the definition of "algorithm", and activity is on-going because of issues surrounding, in particular, [[foundations of mathematics]] (especially the [[Church–Turing thesis]]) and [[philosophy of mind]] (especially arguments about [[artificial intelligence]]).

For example, a date [[Anno Domini]] (A.D.) {{currentyear}} becomes Anno Lucis (A.L.) {{#expr:{{currentyear}}+4000}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url= http://www.freemasonry.london.museum/resources/your-questions-answered/# | title = What is the Masonic Calendar? | author = | accessdate = 2006-07-06 | publisher = Library and Museum Charitable Trust of the United Grand Lodge of England}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[calendar era]], which would designate 4001&amp;nbsp;[[Before Common Era|BCE]] as '[[year zero]]', was adopted in the 18th century as a simplification of the ''Anno Mundi'' era dating system used in the [[Hebrew calendar]] and borrowing from other ideas of that time regarding the [[Dating creation|year of creation]].

After the [[Masoretic]] text was published, dating creation around 4000 BC became common, and it was received with wide support.&lt;ref&gt;''A Collation of the Sacred Scriptures'', Charles Roger Dundee, 1847, pp. 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed calculations of the date of creation, using the Masoretic from the 10th century to the 18th century, were numerous and fluctuated by many decades.&lt;ref name=Jones26&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wsITeHwP9K0C&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q=%22date+of+creation%22+%22no+dispute%22&amp;f=false |title=Chronology of the Old Testament: Solving the Bible's Most Intriguing Mysteries |author=Floyd Nolen Jones |publisher=New Leaf Publishing Group |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-89051-416-0 |page=26 |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, [[Isaac Newton]]'s calculation pointed at the year 4000 BC.&lt;ref name=Jones26/&gt; 

Among the Masoretic creation estimates or calculations for the date of creation, [[Ussher chronology|Archbishop Ussher's specific chronology]] dating the creation to 4004 BC became the most accepted and popular in Christendom, mainly because this specific date was attached to the [[King James Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/ussher.html |title=Bishop James Ussher Sets the Date for Creation: October 23, 4004 B.C |publisher=Law2.umkc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew Calendar has traditionally, since the 4th century AD by [[Hillel II]], dated the creation to 3761 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.net/jewish+calendar |title=Definition of Jewish Calendar from |publisher=dictionary.net |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askelm.com/doctrine/d911001.htm |title=The Jewish Calendar and Biblical Authority |publisher=Askelm.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117074827/http://askelm.com/doctrine/d911001.htm |archivedate=2013-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the ''[[Seder Olam Rabbah]]'' compiled by [[Jose ben Halafta]] in AD 160, and in agreement with ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]'', in which the Muslim chronologist [[al-Biruni]] identifies ''anno mundi'' as 3448 years before the [[Seleucid era]] but not with ''[[Seder Olam Zutta]]'', which dates it to 4339 BC and was compiled in AD 804.&lt;ref&gt;Young's Analytical Concordance of the Holy Bible, 1879, 8th Edition, 1939—entry under 'Creation', quoting Dr. William Hales New Analysis of Chronology and Geography, History and Prophecy, Vol. 1, 1830, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13244">The '''argument from beauty''' (also the '''aesthetic argument''') is an argument for the existence of a realm of immaterial ideas or, most commonly, for the [[existence of God]].

Plato argued there is a transcendent plane of abstract ideas, or universals, which are more perfect than real-world examples of those ideas.  Later philosophers connected this plane to the idea of goodness, beauty, and then the Christian God.

Various observers have also argued that the experience of beauty is evidence of the existence of a universal God. Depending on the observer, this might include artificially beautiful things like music or art, natural beauty like landscapes or astronomical bodies, or the elegance of abstract ideas like the laws of mathematics or physics.

The best-known defender of the aesthetic argument is [[Richard Swinburne]].

==History of the argument from Platonic universals==

The argument from beauty has two aspects. The first is connected with the independent existence of what philosophers term a "universal" (see [[Universal (metaphysics)]] and also [[Problem of universals]]). [[Plato]] argued that particular examples of, say a [[circle]], all fall short of the perfect exemplar of a circle that exists outside the realm of the senses as an eternal Idea. Beauty for Plato is a particularly important type of universal. Perfect beauty exists only in the eternal Form of beauty  (see [[Platonic epistemology]]). For Plato the argument for a timeless idea of beauty does not involve so much whether the gods exist (Plato was not a monotheist) but rather whether there is an immaterial realm independent and superior to the imperfect world of sense. Later Greek thinkers such as [[Plotinus]] (c. 204/5–270 CE) expanded Plato's argument to support the existence of a totally transcendent "One", containing no parts. Plotinus identified this "One" with the concept of "Good" and the principle of "Beauty". [[Christianity]] adopted this Neo-Platonic conception and saw it as a strong argument for the existence of a supreme [[God]]. In the early fifth century, for example, [[Augustine of Hippo]] discusses the many beautiful things in nature and asks "Who made these beautiful changeable things, if not one who is beautiful and unchangeable?"&lt;ref&gt;''Sermons of St. Augustine'', 241, Easter: c.411 CE&lt;/ref&gt; This second aspect is what most people today understand as the argument from beauty.

==Richard Swinburne==

A contemporary British philosopher of religion, [[Richard Swinburne]], known for philosophical arguments about the existence of God, advocates a variation of the argument from beauty:

{{quote|God has reason to make a basically beautiful world, although also reason to leave some of the beauty or ugliness of the world within the power of creatures to determine; but he would seem to have overriding reason not to make a basically ugly world beyond the powers of creatures to improve. Hence, if there is a God there is more reason to expect a basically beautiful world than a basically ugly one. A priori, however, there is no particular reason for expecting a basically beautiful rather than a basically ugly world. In consequence, if the world is beautiful, that fact would be evidence for God's existence. For, in this case, if we let k be 'there is an orderly physical universe', e be 'there is a beautiful universe', and h be 'there is a God', P(e/h.k) will be greater than P(e/k)... Few, however, would deny that our universe (apart from its animal and human inhabitants, and aspects subject to their immediate control) has that beauty. Poets and painters and ordinary men down the centuries have long admired the beauty of the orderly procession of the heavenly bodies, the scattering of the galaxies through the heavens (in some ways random, in some ways orderly), and the rocks, sea, and wind interacting on earth, ''[[The Spacious Firmament on High|The spacious firmament on high, and all the blue ethereal sky]]'', the water lapping against 'the old eternal rocks', and the plants of the jungle and of temperate climates, contrasting with the desert and the Arctic wastes. Who in his senses would deny that here is beauty in abundance? If we confine ourselves to the argument from the beauty of the inanimate and plant worlds, the argument surely works." &lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, Richard, ''The Existence of God'', OUP, 2nd Edition, 2004, {{ISBN|0199271682}}. {{page needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Art as a route to God==

The most frequent invocation of the argument from beauty today involves the aesthetic experience one obtains from great literature, music or art.  In the concert hall or museum one can easily feel carried away from the mundane.  For many people this feeling of transcendence approaches the religious in intensity.  It is a commonplace to regard concert halls and museums as the cathedrals of the modern age because they seem to translate beauty into meaning and transcendence.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

[[Dostoevsky]] was a proponent of the transcendent nature of beauty. His enigmatic statement: "Beauty will save the world" is frequently cited.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], ''[[The Idiot]]''. {{page needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] in his [[Nobel Prize]] lecture reflected upon this phrase:

{{quote|And so perhaps that old trinity of Truth and Good and Beauty is not just the formal outworn formula it used to seem to us during our heady, materialistic youth. If the crests of these three trees join together, as the investigators and explorers used to affirm, and if the too obvious, too straight branches of Truth and Good are crushed or amputated and cannot reach the light—yet perhaps the whimsical, unpredictable, unexpected branches of Beauty will make their way through and soar up to that very place and in this way perform the work of all three. And in that case it was not a slip of the tongue for Dostoyevsky to say that "Beauty will save the world" but a prophecy. After all, he was given the gift of seeing much, he was extraordinarily illumined. And consequently perhaps art, literature, can in actual fact help the world of today.&lt;ref&gt;"Beauty Will Save the World: The Nobel Lecture on Literature" by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his book, ''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] describes the argument thus:

{{quote|Another character in the [[Aldous Huxley]] novel just mentioned proved the existence of God by playing [[Beethoven's string quartet no. 15]] in A minor ('Heiliger Dankgesang') on a gramophone. Unconvincing as that sounds, it does represent a popular strand of argument. I have given up counting the number of times I receive the more or less truculent challenge: 'How do you account for [[Shakespeare]], then?' (Substitute [[Schubert]], [[Michelangelo]], etc. to taste.) The argument will be so familiar, I needn’t document it further. But the logic behind it is never spelled out, and the more you think about it the more vacuous you realize it to be. Obviously [[Beethoven]]'s late quartets are sublime. So are [[Shakespeare's sonnets]]. They are sublime if God is there and they are sublime if he isn't. They do not prove the existence of God; they prove the existence of Beethoven and of Shakespeare. A great conductor is credited with saying: 'If you have [[Mozart]] to listen to, why would you need God?'&lt;ref name=Dawkins110&gt;Dawkins, Richard, ''The God Delusion'', (Mariner Books:2008), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Philosophical basis of science and mathematics==

Exactly what role to attribute to [[Mathematical beauty|beauty in mathematics]] and science is hotly contested, see [[Philosophy of mathematics]]. The argument from beauty in science and mathematics is an argument for [[philosophical realism]] against [[nominalism]]. The debate revolves around the question, "Do things like scientific laws, numbers and sets have an independent 'real' existence outside individual human minds?". The argument is quite complex and still far from settled. Scientists and philosophers often marvel at the congruence between [[patterns in nature|nature and mathematics]]. In 1960 the Nobel Prize–winning physicist and mathematician [[Eugene Wigner]] wrote an article entitled "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]". He pointed out that "the enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is something bordering on the mysterious and that there is no rational explanation for it."&lt;ref&gt;"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences," in ''[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]]'', vol. 13, No. I (February 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; In applying mathematics to understand the natural world, scientists often employ aesthetic criteria that seem far removed from science. [[Einstein]] once said that "the only physical theories that we are willing to accept are the beautiful ones."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Graham Farmelo, ''It Must be Beautiful: Great Equations of Modern Science'' (Granta Books, 2002), p. xii. Farmelo provides an extensive discussion of this topic and gives numerous examples from the history of science.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, beauty can sometimes be misleading; [[Thomas Huxley]] wrote that "Science is organized common sense, where many a beautiful theory was killed by an ugly fact."&lt;ref name=Stewart278&gt;Quoted in [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)]], ''Why Beauty is Truth'' (Basic Books, 2007), p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

When developing hypotheses, scientists use beauty and elegance as valuable selective criteria. The more beautiful a theory, the more likely is it to be true. The mathematical physicist [[Hermann Weyl]] said with evident amusement, "My work has always tried to unite the true with the beautiful and when I had to choose one or the other, I usually chose the beautiful."&lt;ref name=Stewart278/&gt; The quantum physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]] wrote to Einstein, "You may object that by speaking of simplicity and beauty I am introducing aesthetic criteria of truth, and I frankly admit that I am strongly attracted by the simplicity and beauty of the mathematical schemes which nature presents us."&lt;ref name=Stewart278/&gt;

==Criticisms==

The argument implies beauty is something immaterial instead of being a subjective neurological response to stimuli. Philosophers since [[Immanuel Kant]] increasingly argue that beauty is an artifact of individual human minds.  A 'beautiful' sunset is according to this perspective aesthetically neutral in itself.  It is our cognitive response that interprets it as 'beautiful.' Others would argue that this cognitive response has been developed through the evolutionary development of the brain and its exposure to particular stimuli over long ages.  Others point to the existence of evil and various types of ugliness as invalidating the argument. [[Joseph McCabe]], a [[freethought]] writer of the early 20th century, questioned the argument in ''The Existence of God'', when he asked whether God also created parasitic microbes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]] (1933), The Existence of God, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] had no trouble seeing beauty in mathematics but he did not see it as a valid argument for the existence of God. In the Study of Mathematics, he wrote: "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1919). "The Study of Mathematics". Mysticism and Logic: And Other Essays. Longman. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also wrote: "My conclusion is that there is no reason to believe any of the dogmas of traditional theology and, further, that there is no reason to wish that they were true. Man, in so far as he is not subject to natural forces, is free to work out his own destiny. The responsibility is his, and so is the opportunity." &lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand "Is There a God?" (1952: repr. ''The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, Volume 11: Last Philosophical Testament'', 1943-68, ed. John G Slater and Peter Köllner (London: Routledge, 1997), pp. 543–48&lt;/ref&gt;  [[H. L. Mencken]] stated that humans have created things of greater beauty when he wrote, "I also pass over the relatively crude contrivances of this Creator in the aesthetic field, wherein He has been far surpassed by man, as, for example, for adroitness of design, for complexity or for beauty, the sounds of an orchestra."&lt;ref&gt;''Minority Report'', H. L. Mencken's Notebooks, Knopf, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Dawkins summarises the argument as: "How dare another human being make such beautiful music/poetry/art when I can't? It must be God that did it".&lt;ref name=Dawkins110/&gt;

'''Biosequestration''' is the capture and storage of the atmospheric [[greenhouse gas]] [[carbon dioxide]] by biological processes.

This may be by increased [[photosynthesis]] (through practices such as reforestation / preventing deforestation and genetic engineering&lt;ref&gt;Jansson, Christer, et al. "[https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/60/9/685/237929/Phytosequestration-Carbon-Biosequestration-by Phytosequestration: carbon biosequestration by plants and the prospects of genetic engineering]." Bioscience 60.9 (2010): 685-696.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beerling"/&gt;); by enhanced soil carbon trapping in agriculture; or by the use of [[algal]] bio sequestration (see [[algae bioreactor]]) to absorb the carbon dioxide emissions from coal, [[petroleum]] (oil) or [[natural gas]]-fired [[electricity generation]].

Biosequestration as a natural process has occurred in the past, and was responsible for the formation of the extensive coal and oil deposits which are now being burned. It is a key policy concept in the [[climate change mitigation]] debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garnaut|2008|p=558}} p. 609 defines biosequestration as involving greenhouse gases in general.&lt;/ref&gt; It does not generally refer to the sequestering of carbon dioxide in oceans (see [[carbon sequestration]] and [[ocean acidification]]) or rock formations, depleted oil or gas reservoirs (see [[oil depletion]] and [[peak oil]]), deep saline [[aquifers]], or deep coal seams (see [[coal mining]]) (for all see [[geosequestration]]) or through the use of industrial chemical [[carbon capture and storage|carbon dioxide scrubbing]].

==The importance of plants in storing atmospheric carbon dioxide==
[[File:Kew Gardens Waterlily House - Sept 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Kew Gardens Waterlily House. David Iliff, 2008]] [[File:CO2 increase rate.png|thumb|right|Recent year-to-year increase of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]After [[water vapour]] (concentrations of which humans have limited capacity to influence) [[carbon dioxide]] is the most abundant and stable [[greenhouse gas]] in the atmosphere ([[methane]] rapidly reacts to form water vapour and carbon dioxide). Atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased from about 280 ppm in 1750 to 383 ppm in 2007 and is increasing at an average rate of 2 ppm pr year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garnaut|2008|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's oceans have previously played an important role in sequestering atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] through solubility and the action of [[phytoplankton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Raven JA, Falkowski PG |title=Oceanic sinks for atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=Plant Cell &amp; Environment |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=741–55 |year=1999 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-3040.1999.00419.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, and the likely adverse consequences for humans and the biosphere of associated [[global warming]], increases the significance of investigating policy mechanisms for encouraging biosequestration.

==Reforestation, avoided deforestation and LULUCF==
[[File:Richea pandanifolia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reforestation]] and reducing [[deforestation]] can increase biosequestration in four ways. Pandani (Richea pandanifolia) near Lake Dobson, [[Mount Field National Park]], Tasmania, Australia]]  The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) estimates that the cutting down of forests is now contributing close to 20 per cent of the overall [[greenhouse gases]] entering the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change * [http://www.ipcc.ch/ The IPCC web site]&lt;/ref&gt; Candell and Raupach argue that there are four primary ways in which [[reforestation]] and reducing [[deforestation]] can increase biosequestration. First, by increasing the volume of existing forest. Second, by increasing the carbon density of existing forests at a stand and landscape scale. Third, by expanding the use of forest products that will sustainably replace fossil-fuel emissions.

The [[United Nations]] [[Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) Article 4(1)(a) requires all Parties to "develop, periodically update, publish and make available to the Conference of the Parties" as well as "national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources" "removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol." Under the UNFCCC reporting guidelines, human-induced greenhouse emissions must be reported in six sectors: energy (including stationary energy and transport); industrial processes; solvent and other product use; agriculture; waste; and ''land use, land use change and forestry'' ([[LULUCF]]).&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Environment and Heritage (DEH) 2006, National Greenhouse Gas Inventory 2004: Accounting for the 108% Target, Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt; The rules governing accounting and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from LULUCF under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] are contained in several decisions of the Conference of Parties under the UNFCCC and [[LULUCF]] has been the subject of two major reports by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC).&lt;ref&gt;IPCC.

As an example, the ''Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory'' (NGGI) prepared in compliance with these requirements indicates that the [[energy sector]] accounts for 69 per cent of Australia’s emissions, [[agriculture]] 16 per cent and [[LULUCF]] six per cent. Since 1990, however, emissions from the energy sector have increased 35 per cent (stationary energy up 43% and transport up 23%). By comparison, emissions from LULUCF have fallen by 73%.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Environment and Heritage (DEH) 2006, National Greenhouse Gas Inventory: Analysis of Recent Trends and Greenhouse Indicators 1990 to 2004, Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt; However, questions have been raised by Andrew Macintosh about the veracity of the estimates of emissions from the LULUCF sector because of discrepancies between the Australian Federal and [[Queensland Government]]s’ land clearing data. Data published by the ''Statewide Landcover and Trees Study'' (SLATS) in Queensland, for example, show that the total amount of land clearing in Queensland identified under SLATS between 1989/90 and 2000/01 is approximately 50 per cent higher than the amount estimated by the [[Australian Federal Government]]’s ''National Carbon Accounting System'' (NCAS) between 1990 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Macintosh, Andrew |title=The National Greenhouse Accounts and Land Clearing: Do the numbers stack up? |publisher=Australia Institute |pages=19–20 |date=January 2007 |id=Research Paper No. 38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James E. Hansen]] argues that, "An effective way to achieve drawdown [of carbon dioxide] would be to burn biofuels in power plants and capture the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with the biofuels derived from agricultural or urban wastes or grown on degraded lands using little or no fossil fuel inputs."&lt;ref&gt;James Hansen.

Under a 2009 agreement, Loy Yang Power and MBD Energy Ltd will build a pilot [[Fossil fuel power plant]] at the Latrobe Valley power station in Australia using biosequestration technology in the form of an algal synthesiser system. Captured CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the waste exhaust flue gases will be injected into circulating waste water to grow oil-rich algae where sunlight and nutrients will produce heavy oil-laden slurry that can make high grade oil for energy, or stock feed.&lt;ref&gt;MBD Energy Ltd.

==Philosophical basis of biosequestration==
The arguments for biosequestration are often shaped in terms of economic theory, yet there is a well-recognised quality of life dimension to this debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schumacher, E. F. |authorlink=EF Schumacher |title=Small is Beautiful: a study of economics as if people mattered |publisher=Abacus |location=London |year=1974 |page=112 |isbn=978-0-349-13139-9 |title-link=Small is Beautiful }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biosequestration assists human beings to increase their collective and individual contributions to the essential resources of the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Davies, Geoffrey F. |title=Economia: new economic systems to empower people and support the living world |publisher=ABC Books for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation |location=Sydney |year=2004 |pages=202–3 |isbn=978-0-7333-1298-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy case for biosequestration overlaps with principles of [[ecology]], [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]], as well as [[biosphere]], [[biodiversity]] and [[ecosystem]] protection, [[environmental ethics]], [[climate ethics]] and [[Conservation (ethic)|natural conservation]].

==Barriers to increased global biosequestration==
[[File:USA Lassen NP Kings Creek CA edit3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lassen National Park]], Kings Creek, USA.]] The [[Garnaut Climate Change Review]] notes many barriers to increased global biosequestration. "There must be changes in the accounting regimes for [[greenhouse gases]]. Investments are required in research, development and commercialisation of superior approaches to biosequestration. Adjustments are required in the regulation of land use. New institutions will need to be developed to coordinate the interests in utilisation of biosequestration opportunities across small business in rural communities. Special efforts will be required to unlock potential in rural communities in developing countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garnaut|2008|p=582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saddler and King have argued that biosequestration and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions should not be handled within a global [[emissions trading scheme]] because of difficulties with measuring such emissions, problems in controlling them and the burden that would be placed on numerous small-scale farming operations.&lt;ref&gt;Saddler H and King H. Agriculture and Emissions Trading: The Impossible Dream. Australia Institute Discussion Paper 102. Australia Institute, Canberra. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Collett likewise maintains that [[REDD]] credits (post-facto payments to developing countries for reducing their [[deforestation]] rates below an historical or projected reference rate), simply create a complex market approach to this global public health problem that reduces transparency and accountability when targets are not met and will not be as effective as developed nations voluntarily funding countries to keep their rainforests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Collett M |title=In the REDD: A conservative approach to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation |journal=CCLR |volume=3 |pages=324–39 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Rainforest Movement]] has argued that poor developing countries could be pressured to accept [[reforestation]] projects under the [[Kyoto Protocol]]'s [[Clean Development Mechanism]] in order to earn [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] simply to pay off the interest on debt to the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann L. The Carbon shop: Planting New Problems. Briefing paper, Plantations Campaign, World Rainforest Movement, Moreton-in-March (UK) and Montevideo (Uruguay). 1999. p3.&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions also exist over forest management between the sovereignty claims of nations states, arguments about [[common heritage of mankind]] and the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities; the [[Forest Peoples Programme]] (FPP) arguing the anti-deforestation programs could merely allow financial benefits to flow to national treasuries, privilege would-be [[corporate forest]] degraders who manipulate the system by periodically threatening forests, rather than local communities who conserve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Humphreys|2008|p=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of such projects will also depend on the accuracy of the baseline data and the number of countries involved. Further, it has been argued that if biosequestration is to play a significant role in mitigating [[anthropogenic climate change]] then coordinated policies should set a goal of achieving global forest cover to its extent prior to the industrial revolution in the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Humphreys|2008|p=440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that the [[United Nations]] mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation ([[REDD]]) may increase pressure to convert or modify other ecosystems, especially savannahs and wetlands, for food or biofuel, even though those ecosystems also have high carbon sequestration potential. Globally, for example, peatlands cover only 3% of the land surface but store twice the amount of carbon as all the world's forests, whilst mangrove forests and saltmarshes are examples of relatively low-biomass ecosystems with high levels of productivity and carbon sequestration.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Sutherland WJ et al. A horizon scan of global conservation issues for 2010 Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution
Volume 25, Issue 1, January 2010, Pages 1-7 {{doi|10.1016/j.tree.2009.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have argued that [[REDD]] is a critical component of an effective global biosequestration strategy that could provide significant benefits, such as the conservation of [[biodiversity]], particularly if it moves away from focusing on protecting forests that are most cost-effective for reducing carbon emissions (such as those in [[Brazil]] where agricultural opportunity costs are relatively low, unlike Asia, which has sizeable revenues from oil palm, rubber, rice, and maize). They argue REDD could be varied to allow funding of programs to slow peat degradation in [[Indonesia]] and target protection of biodiversity in "hot spot"—areas with high species richness and relatively little remaining forest. Some purchasers, they maintain, of REDD carbon credits, such as multinational corporations or nations, might pay a premium to save imperiled eco-systems or areas with high-profile species.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Venter, William F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6995">[[File:Beethoven pf son 32 title.jpg|thumb|Original title page for the Piano Sonata, Opus 111]]
The '''Catalogues of Beethoven compositions''' are all of the different ways in which the [[List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven|musical compositions]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] have been organized by researchers into his music.

==The problem==
When Beethoven died, he left (as many other composers) a great many compositions behind.  In Beethoven's case, a sizable majority of his works were published.  However, some works were not published, and some works were unfinished, either because he had laid them aside, or died before he could finish them.  The catalogues described here are attempts to organize and identify with precision all of these works in ways that are useful to musicologists, musicians, and the listening public.

Most of Beethoven's best known works were published in his lifetime, and bear opus numbers, with which they may be reliably identified.  The short piano piece "[[Für Elise]]" is a notable exception: it is usually designated [[WoO]] (Werke ohne Opuszahl – literally, "works without opus number") 59.

==Opus number==
[[File:Beethoven_bust_statue_by_Hagen.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A bust of Beethoven, based on his 1812 life mask]]

The traditional 19th-century method of identifying a composer's works was for publishers to assign some sort of consecutive [[Opus number]] to the works as they were published.  This method is not entirely satisfactory to anyone.  Musicians and the listening public have no reliable way to distinguish different works with similar characteristics.  Musicologists cannot reliably identify unpublished works, nor do they have a reliable indication from the opus number of the actual composition date(s).  For example, the [[Octet (Beethoven)|Octet]], written from 1792 to 1793 is Opus 103, while Opus 102 and Opus 104 were written in 1815 and 1817 respectively. Some opus numbers comprise multiple pieces; 172 works are divided among 138 opus numbers.

All of Beethoven's compositions up to and including Opus 135 were published in Beethoven's lifetime; later numbers were published posthumously, and are generally denoted by "Op. posth."

==Kinsky catalogue==
{{see also|WoO (Beethoven)|List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven#List of works by number}}
In 1955, [[Georg Kinsky]] and [[Hans Halm]] published a catalogue of Beethoven's works, in which they assigned numbers to 205 "Werke ohne Opuszahl" (meaning "works without opus number" in German) to ''some'' of Beethoven's unpublished works.  These numbers given these works are generally preceded by "[[WoO]]".

The Kinsky–Halm catalogue also lists 18 works in an appendix as being either doubtfully attributed, or simply spurious. Some of those listed as doubtful have since been shown to be authored by Beethoven.{{Example needed}}  These numbers are generally preceded by "Anh.", short for German ''Anhang'', meaning ''appendix''.

==Hess catalogue==
The Swiss composer and musicologist [[Willy Hess (composer)|Willy Hess]] also researched and published a catalogue in the 1950s, in which he included pieces not included in the 19th century [[Beethoven Gesamtausgabe|complete edition]] published by [[Breitkopf and Härtel]]. Hess included many more fragmentary works than did Kinsky, and his catalog runs to 335 entries in the "Hauptkatalog" (main catalogue), and 66 "doubtful and falsely-attributed" works in an appendix. Many pieces have both WoO and H numbers.{{Example needed}}

==Biamonti catalogue==
Beethoven's compositions are also organized through the [[Biamonti Catalogue]], compiled by [[Giovanni Biamonti]] and published in 1968.  This work is an attempt to chronologically order all of Beethoven's creative output, in a manner similar to the catalogue of [[Franz Schubert]]'s works by [[Otto Erich Deutsch]].  It combines the pieces with opus numbers, all of the works from the Kinsky and Hess catalogues, and previously uncatalogued fragments, into a single list comprising 849 entries.

[[Image:Larks tongue.JPG|thumb|right|A chamfer with a lark's tongue finish]]

A '''chamfer''' {{IPAc-en|'|tʃ|æ|m|.|f|ər}} is a transitional edge between two faces of an object.  A form of [[bevel]], it is created at a 45° angle to two adjoining right-angled faces.  A '''lark's tongue''' is a chamfer which ends short of a piece in a gradual upward curve, leaving the balance as a right angle.  Chamfers may be formed in either inside or outside adjoining faces of an object or room.  They are also used to "ease" otherwise sharp edges, both for safety and to prevent damage to them.

By comparison, a ''[[fillet (mechanics)|fillet]]''{{efn|Pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ|l|ᵻ|t}} {{respell|FIL|ət}}, like "fill it"}} is the rounding-off of an interior corner, and a "round" (or "radius") the rounding of an outside one.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen et al., "Engineering Drawing and Design" page 179. Delmar, 2004 {{ISBN|0-7668-1634-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chamfers are commonly employed in [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[manufacturing engineering]], and in poured-in-place [[formwork|concrete formwork]]. They are used in furniture such as counters and table tops to ease their edges; when the edges are rounded instead they are called [[bullnose]]d.  Special tools such as [[chamfer mill]]s and [[chamfer plane]]s are used. 

Chamfers are necessary in parabolic glass mirror manufacture{{cn|date=October 2017}} and desirable in certain [[printed circuit boards]].

==Architecture==
Chamfers are commonly used in architecture, both for functional and aesthetic reasons.  The base of the [[Taj Mahal]] is a [[cube]] with chamfered corners, thereby creating an [[octagon]]al architectural footprint.  Its great gate is formed of chamfered base stones and chamfered [[corbel]]s for a balcony or equivalent [[cornice (architecture)|cornice]] towards the roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tajmahal.gov.in/interior_decoration.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[city block]]s in [[Barcelona, Spain|Barcelona]], [[València]] and various other cities in [[Spain]], and street corners ([[Curb (road)|curb]]s) in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]], are chamfered. The chamfering was designed as an embellishment and a modernization of urban space in [[Barcelona]]'s mid-19th century [[Eixample]] or Expansion District, where the buildings follow the chamfering of the sidewalks and streets. This pioneering design opens up broader perspectives, provides pleasant pedestrian areas and allows for greater visibility while turning. It might also be considered to allow for turning to be somewhat more comfortable as, supposedly, drivers would not need to slow down as much when making a turn as they would have to if the corner were a square 90 degrees,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} though in Barcelona, most chamfered corners are used as parking spaces or loading-unloading zones, leaving the traffic to run as in normal 90-degree street corners.

==Other uses==
===In parabolic glass mirror design===
Outside of aesthetics, chamfering is part of the process of hand-crafting a parabolic glass telescope mirror.&lt;ref name="IUCAA SciPOP"&gt;{{cite web | title=How to Build a Telescope ? | website=[[IUCAA]] SciPOP | url=http://scipop.iucaa.in/Literature/hbt1/hbt-welcome.html | access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the surface of the disc can be ground, the edges must first be chamfered to prevent chipping. This can be accomplished by placing the disc in a metal bowl containing [[silicon carbide]] and rotating the disc with a rocking motion. The grit will thus wear off the sharp edge of the glass.{{Citation needed|reason=At minimum, domain of the above warrants xref to mirror mfg (and many other) fab techniues where edge chipping is problematic.|date=March 2017}}

===In printed circuit board (PCB) design===
[[Image:PCBChamfer.PNG|thumb|right|Right angled and chamfered intersections of a PCB track]]
In [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) designing, a chamfer may be applied to a right-angled edge of a conductive junction in order to strengthen that location. Chamfering of junctions may also be applied in high-frequency PCB design in order to reduce reflections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bogatin|first1=Eric|title=When to worry about trace corners: Rule of Thumb #24|url=http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/all-aboard-/4438573/When-to-worry-about-trace-corners--Rule-of-Thumb--24|website=EDN Network|publisher=UBM Canon|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Panel on Climate Change|IPCC's]] 2014 [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|assessment report]], "Mitigation is a public good; climate change is a case of the '[[tragedy of the commons]]'. Effective climate change mitigation will not be achieved if each agent (individual, institution or country) acts independently in its own selfish interest (see [[International cooperation]] and [[Emissions trading]]), suggesting the need for collective action. Some [[climate change adaptation|adaptation]] actions, on the other hand, have characteristics of a private good as benefits of actions may accrue more directly to the individuals, regions, or countries that undertake them, at least in the short term. Nevertheless, financing such adaptive activities remains an issue, particularly for poor individuals and countries."&lt;ref name="AR5-WG3-Chap3"&gt;

One of the issues often discussed in relation to climate change mitigation is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) has the ultimate objective of [[Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change|preventing "dangerous" anthropogenic (i.e., human) interference of the climate system]]. As is stated in Article 2 of the Convention, this requires that greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where [[climate change and ecosystems|ecosystems]] can adapt naturally to climate change, [[climate change and agriculture|food production]] is not threatened, and [[economics of global warming|economic development]] can proceed in a sustainable fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In fact, stabilizing emissions at current levels would result in the atmospheric concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; continuing to rise over the 21st century and beyond (see the graphs opposite).

The reason for this is that human activities are adding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it (see [[carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere]] for a complete explanation).&lt;ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/&gt; This is analogous to a flow of water into a bathtub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of the other greenhouse gasses humans emit also depends on how fast their emissions are added to the atmosphere, and how fast the GHGs are removed. Stabilization for these gases is described in the later section on [[#Non-CO2 greenhouse gases|non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; GHGs]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 2018 an international team of scientist published research saying that the current mitigation policy in [[Paris Agreement]] is insufficient to limit the temperature rise to 2 degrees. They say that even if all the current pledges will be accomplished there is a chance for a 4.5 degree temperature rise in decades.

To create lasting climate change mitigation, the replacement of high carbon [[emission intensity]] power sources, such as conventional [[fossil fuel]]s—[[oil]], [[coal]], and [[natural gas]]—with [[low-carbon power]] sources is required. Fossil fuels supply humanity with the vast majority of our energy demands, and at a growing rate. In 2012 the IEA noted that coal accounted for half the increased energy use of the prior decade, growing faster than all renewable energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/English.pdf World energy outlook 2012 (IEA)]&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[hydroelectricity]] and [[nuclear power]] together provide the majority of the generated [[low-carbon power]] fraction of global total power consumption.

In general, higher consumption lifestyles have a greater environmental impact. Several scientific studies have shown that when people, especially those living in [[developed country|developed countries]] but more generally including all countries, wish to reduce their carbon footprint, there are four key "high-impact" actions they can take:&lt;ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017&gt;{{cite journal |title= The climate mitigation gap: education and government recommendations miss the most effective individual actions |journal= Environmental Research Letters |first1= Seth |last1= Wynes |first2= Kimberly A |last2= Nicholas |date= 12 July 2017 |volume= 12 |page= 074024 |number= 7 |doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541 |bibcode= 2017ERL....12g4024W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ceballos|first1=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul P |last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=23 May 2017|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/07/05/1704949114.full|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|volume=114|issue=30|pages=E6089–E6096|quote=Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction, namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich.

:1. [[Human overpopulation|Not having]] an additional child (58.6 tonnes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalent emission reductions per year)

:2. Living [[car-free movement|car-free]] (2.4 tonnes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

:3. Avoiding one round-trip transatlantic flight (1.6 tonnes)

:4. Eating a [[plant-based diet]] (0.8 tonnes)

These appear to differ significantly from the popular advice for “greening” one's lifestyle, which seem to fall mostly into the “low-impact” category: Replacing a typical car with a hybrid (0.52 tonnes); Washing clothes in cold water (0.25 tonnes); Recycling (0.21 tonnes); Upgrading light bulbs (0.10 tonnes); etc. The researchers found that public discourse on reducing one's carbon footprint overwhelmingly focuses on low-impact behaviors, and that mention of the high-impact behaviors is almost non-existent in the mainstream media, government publications, K-12 school textbooks, etc.&lt;ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05/&gt;&lt;ref name="PimmJenkins"/&gt;

The researchers added that “Our recommended high-impact actions are more effective than many more commonly discussed options (e.g. eating a plant-based diet saves eight times more emissions than upgrading light bulbs). More significantly, a US family who chooses to have one fewer child would provide the same level of emissions reductions as 684 teenagers who choose to adopt comprehensive recycling for the rest of their lives.”&lt;ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05/&gt;&lt;ref name="PimmJenkins"/&gt;

=====Dietary change=====
{{See also|Low-carbon diet}}

Overall, food accounts for the largest share of consumption-based GHG emissions with nearly 20% of the global carbon footprint, followed by housing, mobility, services, manufactured products, and construction. Food and services are more significant in poor countries, while mobility and manufactured goods are more significant in rich countries.&lt;ref name="fleurbaey-etal-2014"&gt;{{cite book

====Energy efficiency and conservation====
{{Main|Efficient energy use|Energy conservation}}
[[File:Led-lampa.jpg|thumb|A 230-volt LED light bulb, with an [[Edison screw|E27]] base (10 [[watt]]s, 806 [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s).]]

Efficient energy use, sometimes simply called "energy efficiency", is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing [[LED lamp|LED lighting]], [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]], or natural [[skylight|skylight windows]] reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional [[incandescent light bulb]]s. [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s use only 33% of the energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Diesendorf|Diesendorf, Mark]] (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', UNSW Press, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; LED lamps use only about 10% of the energy an incandescent lamp requires.

Energy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]]. For example, the state of [[California]] began implementing energy-efficiency measures in the mid-1970s, including building code and appliance standards with strict efficiency requirements. During the following years, California's energy consumption has remained approximately flat on a per capita basis while national US consumption doubled. As part of its strategy, California implemented a "loading order" for new energy resources that puts energy efficiency first, renewable electricity supplies second, and new fossil-fired power plants last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses using less energy to achieve a lesser energy demanding service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter, driving less, or working in a less brightly lit room. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=2929&amp;language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Demand-side switching sources====
Fuel switching on the demand side refers to changing the type of fuel used to satisfy a need for an energy service. To meet deep decarbonization goals, like the 80% reduction by 2050 goal being discussed in California and the European Union, many primary energy changes are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Climate Change |publisher=California Air Resources Board |accessdate=2015-04-29 |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/cc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Roadmap for moving to a low-carbon economy in 2050 – European Commission |accessdate= 2015-04-29 |url= http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/roadmap/index_en.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150511100639/http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/roadmap/index_en.htm |archive-date= 2015-05-11 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy efficiency alone may not be sufficient to meet these goals, switching fuels used on the demand side will help lower carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/014038 |issn= 1748-9326 |volume= 8 |issue= 1 |page= 014038 |last1= Wei |first1= Max |last2= Nelson |first2= James H |last3= Greenblatt |first3= Jeffery B |last4= Mileva |first4= Ana |last5= Johnston |first5= Josiah |last6= Ting |first6= Michael |last7= Yang |first7= Christopher |last8= Jones |first8= Chris |last9= McMahon |first9= James E |last10= Kammen |first10= Daniel M |title= Deep carbon reductions in California require electrification and integration across economic sectors |journal= Environmental Research Letters |accessdate= 2015-03-21 |date= 2013-03-01 |url= http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/8/i=1/a=014038?key=crossref.37ef0d9dff3c11bf4c176aa87e4f5831|bibcode= 2013ERL.....8a4038W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Williams |first= James H. |title= The technology path to deep greenhouse gas emissions cuts by 2050: The pivotal role of electricity |journal= Science |volume= 335 |issue= 6064 |pages= 53–9 |accessdate= 2015-03-21 |date= 2012 |url= https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2mz2472z.pdf |bibcode= 2012Sci...335...53W |doi= 10.1126/science.1208365|pmid= 22116030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Progressively coal, oil and eventually natural gas for space and water heating in buildings will need to be reduced. For an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 45 per cent less carbon dioxide than burning [[coal]].&lt;ref name=gasdotorg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalgas.org/environment/naturalgas.asp#greenhouse/ |title=Natural Gas and the Environment |publisher=Naturalgas.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503132200/http://www.naturalgas.org/environment/naturalgas.asp#greenhouse/ |archivedate=2009-05-03 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various ways in which this could happen, and different strategies will likely make sense in different locations. While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very efficient [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.

At the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.

The economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. The EIA Annual Energy Outlook 2014 suggests that domestic gas prices will rise faster than electricity prices which will encourage electrification in the coming decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/ |title=Annual Energy Outlook 2015 – Energy Information Administration |publisher=Eia.gov |date=2015-04-14 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.

Alternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]]. A 2015 study by Energy+Environmental Economics shows that a hybrid approach of decarbonizing pipeline gas, electrification, and energy efficiency can meet carbon reduction goals at a similar cost as only electrification and energy efficiency in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= E3 Decarbonizing Pipeline 01-27-2015.pdf |accessdate= 2015-04-14 |url= https://ethree.com/documents/E3_Decarbonizing_Pipeline_01-27-2015.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150717182053/https://ethree.com/documents/E3_Decarbonizing_Pipeline_01-27-2015.pdf |archive-date= 2015-07-17 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Demand side grid management====
Expanding intermittent electrical sources such as [[wind power]], creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittentcy, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].

[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.

[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers would need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.

[[Demand response]] devices could receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This would allow electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. The [[vehicle-to-grid]] suggestion would use a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.

A [[Yale University]] review published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology analyzing {{CO2}} [[life cycle assessment]](LCA) emissions from nuclear power([[light water reactor]]s) determined that: "The collective LCA literature indicates that life cycle [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions from nuclear power are only a fraction of traditional fossil sources and comparable to renewable technologies."&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE"/&gt;
While some have raised uncertainty surrounding the future GHG emissions of nuclear power as a result of an extreme potential decline in uranium ore grade without a corresponding increase in the [[enriched uranium|efficiency of enrichment methods]]. In a scenario analysis of future global nuclear development, as it could be effected by a decreasing global [[uranium market]] of average ore grade, the analysis determined that depending on conditions, median life cycle nuclear power GHG emissions could be between 9 and 110&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh by 2050, with the latter high figure being derived from a "worst-case scenario" that is not "considered very robust" by the authors of the paper, as the "ore grade" in the scenario is lower than the uranium concentration in many lignite coal ashes.&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Warner |first1= E.

Natural gas emits far fewer greenhouse gases (i.e. {{CO2}} and methane—CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) than coal when burned at power plants, but evidence has been emerging that this benefit could be completely negated by methane leakage at gas drilling fields and other points in the supply chain.

A study performed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) in 1997 sought to discover whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from increased natural gas (predominantly methane) use would be offset by a possible increased level of [[methane emissions]] from sources such as leaks and emissions. The study concluded that the reduction in emissions from increased natural gas use outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions. More recent peer-reviewed studies have challenged the findings of this study, with researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reconfirming findings of high rates of methane (CH4) leakage from natural gas fields.

A 2011 study&lt;ref name="usclimatenetwork.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/resource-database/report-coal-to-gas-the-influence-of-methane-leakage |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102222215/http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/resource-database/report-coal-to-gas-the-influence-of-methane-leakage |archive-date=2015-01-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by noted climate research scientist, Tom Wigley,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Wigley]]&lt;/ref&gt; found that while carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) emissions from fossil fuel combustion may be reduced by using natural gas rather than coal to produce energy, it also found that additional methane (CH4) from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system, offsetting the reduction in {{CO2}} forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas. The study looked at methane leakage from coal mining; changes in radiative forcing due to changes in the emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols; and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation. On balance, these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced {{CO2}} emissions. When gas replaces coal there is additional warming out to 2,050 with an assumed leakage rate of 0%, and out to 2,140 if the leakage rate is as high as 10%.

====Heat pump====
{{Main|Heat pump}}
[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]
A heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a "heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.

While [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term "heat pump" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction—releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times [[efficient energy use|more efficient]] in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters.

It has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market. With a market share of 30% and (potentially) clean electricity, heat pumps could reduce global {{CO2}} emissions by 8% annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Staffell Iain ''et al.'' |year= 2012 |title= A review of domestic heat pumps |url= |journal= [[Energy and Environmental Science]] |volume= 5 |issue= 11 |pages= 9291–9306 |doi= 10.1039/c2ee22653g}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using ground source heat pumps could reduce around 60% of the [[primary energy]] demand and 90% of {{CO2}} emissions in Europe in 2050 and make handling high shares of renewable energy easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Carvalho |first1= |display-authors= 1 |last2= et al |year= 2015 |title= Ground source heat pump carbon emissions and primary energy reduction potential for heating in buildings in Europe—results of a case study in Portugal |url= |journal= [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] |volume= 45 |issue= |pages= 755–768 |doi= 10.1016/j.rser.2015.02.034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using surplus renewable energy in heat pumps is regarded as the most effective household means to reduce global warming and fossil fuel depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sternberg André, Bardow André |year= 2015 |title= ''Power-to-What? – Environmental assessment of energy storage systems''.

With significant amounts of fossil fuel used in electricity production, demands on the electrical grid also generate greenhouse gases. Without a high share of low-carbon electricity, a domestic heat pump will produce more carbon emissions than using natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysolutionscenter.org/assets/1/Page/GHP_Position_Paper_and_apndx_031710.pdf pg 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinks and negative emissions===
{{Main|Carbon sink|Negative carbon dioxide emission}}

A [[carbon sink]] is a natural or artificial reservoir that accumulates and stores some carbon-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period, such as a growing [[forest]]. A [[negative carbon dioxide emission]] on the other hand is a permanent removal of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Examples are [[carbon capture and storage|direct air capture]], [[enhanced weathering]] technologies such as storing it in [[geologic sequestration of CO2|geologic formations]] underground and [[biochar]]. These processes are sometimes considered as variations of sinks or mitigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Main|Deforestation|Reforestation|Biosequestration}}

Almost 20 percent (8{{nbsp}}GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/year) of total greenhouse-gas emissions were from deforestation in 2007. It is estimated that avoided deforestation reduces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions at a rate of 1{{nbsp}}tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per $1–5 in [[opportunity costs]] from lost agriculture. [[Reforestation]] could save at least another 1{{nbsp}}GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/year, at an estimated cost of $5–15/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt; [[Afforestation]] is where there was previously no forest - such plantations are estimated to have to be prohibitively massive to be reduce emissions by itself.&lt;ref&gt;Lena R.

====Enhanced weathering====
Enhanced weathering is the removal of carbon from the air into the earth, enhancing the natural carbon cycle where carbon is mineralized into rock. The [[CarbFix]] project couples with carbon capture and storage in power plants to turn carbon dioxide into stone in a relatively short period of two years, addressing the common concern of leakage in CCS projects. While this project used [[basalt]] rocks, [[olivine]] has also shown promise.&lt;ref name=guardian0916/&gt;

===Geoengineering===
{{Main|Climate engineering}}

Geoengineering is seen by Olivier Sterck as an alternative to mitigation and adaptation, but by Gernot Wagner as an entirely separate response to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00635487/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.climatecentral.org/news/harvard-scientists-taking-geoengineering-into-the-field-21362&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[scientific literature|literature]] assessment, Barker ''et al.'' (2007) described geoengineering as a type of mitigation policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Chapter 28 of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] report ''Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base'' (1992) defined geoengineering as "options that would involve large-scale engineering of our environment in order to combat or counteract the effects of changes in atmospheric chemistry."&lt;ref name="nas_policy_implications"&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1605&amp;page=433 Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base] (1992), [[Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy]] (COSEPUP)&lt;/ref&gt; They evaluated a range of options to try to give preliminary answers to two questions: can these options work and could they be carried out with a reasonable cost. They also sought to encourage discussion of a third question&amp;nbsp;— what adverse side effects might there be. The following types of option were examined: reforestation, increasing ocean absorption of carbon dioxide (carbon sequestration) and screening out some sunlight. NAS also argued "Engineered countermeasures need to be evaluated but should not be implemented without broad understanding of the direct effects and the potential side effects, the ethical issues, and the risks.".&lt;ref name="nas_policy_implications"/&gt; In July 2011 a report by the [[United States Government Accountability Office]] on geoengineering found that "[c]limate engineering technologies do not now offer a viable response to global climate change."&lt;ref&gt;GAO (2011). Technical status, future directions, and potential responses. July 2011. [http://gao.gov/products/GAO-11-71 GAO-11-71]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbon dioxide removal====
{{Main|Carbon dioxide removal|Greenhouse gas remediation|Carbon sequestration}}
{{See also|Carbon air capture}}

[[Carbon dioxide removal]] has been proposed as a method of reducing the amount of radiative forcing. A variety of means of artificially capturing and storing carbon, as well as of enhancing natural sequestration processes, are being explored. The main natural process is [[photosynthesis]] by plants and single-celled organisms (see [[biosequestration]]). Artificial processes vary, and concerns have been expressed about the long-term effects of some of these processes.&lt;ref name=RoyalSociety&gt;The Royal Society, (2009) [http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=35151 "Geoengineering the climate: science, governance and uncertainty"]. Retrieved 2009-09-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is notable that the availability of cheap energy and appropriate sites for [[carbon capture and storage|geological storage]] of carbon may make [[carbon dioxide air capture]] viable commercially. It is, however, generally expected that carbon dioxide air capture may be uneconomic when compared to [[carbon capture and storage]] from major sources&amp;nbsp;— in particular, fossil fuel powered power stations, refineries, etc. As in the case of the US [[Kemper Project]] with carbon capture, costs of energy produced will grow significantly. However, captured CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be used to force more [[crude oil]] out of [[oil field]]s, as [[Statoil]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] have made plans to do.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212213143/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2006/03/08/afx2578203.html Statoil, Shell in plan to raise oil output by injecting {{CO2}} – report], [[AFX News]] via [[Forbes]], March 8, 2006, checked 2009-01-15&lt;/ref&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can also be used in commercial [[greenhouse]]s, giving an opportunity to kick-start the technology. Some attempts have been made to use [[algae]] to capture [[smokestack]] emissions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/erc/spotlights/alg-all.html |title=MIT Energy Research Council: Research Spotlight |publisher=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably the [[GreenFuel Technologies Corporation]], who have now shut down operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/greenfuel-technologies-closing-down-4670/ |title=GreenFuel Technologies Closing Down: Greentech Media |publisher=Greentechmedia.com |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solar radiation management====
{{Main|Solar radiation management}}
{{See also|Stratospheric aerosol injection (climate engineering)}}
The main purpose of solar radiation management seek to reflect sunlight and thus reduce global warming. The ability of stratospheric [[sulfate aerosols]] to create a [[global dimming]] effect has made them a possible candidate for use in [[climate engineering]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/84j11614488142u8/ |journal=Phil.

===Non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; greenhouse gases===
CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not the only GHG relevant to mitigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shindell |first=Drew |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6065/183 |title=Simultaneously Mitigating Near-Term Climate Change and Improving Human Health and Food Security &amp;#124; Science |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=2012-01-13 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and governments have acted to regulate the emissions of other GHGs emitted by human activities ([[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] GHGs). The emissions caps agreed to by most developed countries under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] regulate the emissions of almost all the anthropogenic GHGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

These gases are CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), the [[halocarbon|hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), and [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).

Stabilizing the atmospheric concentrations of the different anthropogenic GHGs requires an understanding of their different physical properties. Stabilization depends both on how quickly GHGs are added to the atmosphere and how fast they are removed. The rate of removal is measured by the atmospheric lifetime of the GHG in question (see the [[greenhouse gas#Global warming potential|main GHG article]] for a list). Here, the lifetime is defined as the time required for a given perturbation of the GHG in the atmosphere to be reduced to 37% of its initial amount.&lt;ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/&gt;
Methane has a relatively short atmospheric lifetime of about 12 years, while N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O's lifetime is about 110 years. For methane, a reduction of about 30% below current emission levels would lead to a stabilization in its atmospheric concentration, while for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, an emissions reduction of more than 50% would be required.&lt;ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/&gt;

[[Methane]] is a significantly more potent greenhouse gas than [[carbon dioxide]] in the amount of heat it can trap, especially in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Methane vs. Carbon Dioxide: A Greenhouse Gas Showdown|url= http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/|website= One Green Planet|accessdate= 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burning one molecule of methane generates one molecule of carbon dioxide, indicating there may be no net benefit in using gas as a fuel source.&lt;ref name="usclimatenetwork.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt; Reducing the amount of waste methane produced in the first place and moving away from use of gas as a fuel source will have a greater beneficial impact, as might other approaches to productive use of otherwise-wasted methane. In terms of prevention, vaccines are being developed in Australia to reduce the significant global warming contributions from [[methane]] released by livestock via [[flatulence]] and [[eructation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6431 Burp vaccine cuts greenhouse gas emissions] ''Rachel Nowak'' for NewScientist September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Another physical property of the anthropogenic GHGs relevant to mitigation is the different abilities of the gases to trap heat (in the form of [[infrared radiation]]). Some gases are more effective at trapping heat than others, e.g., SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is 22,200 times more effective a GHG than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on a per-kilogram basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Montreal Protocol is an international [[treaty]] that has successfully reduced emissions of [[ozone-depleting substance]]s (for example, [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFCs]]), which are also greenhouse gases.

===Transport===
{{Main|Sustainable transport}}
Transportation emissions account for roughly 1/4 of emissions worldwide, and are even more important in terms of impact in developed nations especially in North America and Australia. Many citizens of countries like the United States and Canada who drive personal cars often, see well over half of their climate change impact stemming from the emissions produced from their cars. Modes of mass transportation such as bus, light rail (metro, subway, etc.), and long-distance rail are far and away the most energy-efficient means of motorized transportation for passengers, able to use in many cases over twenty times less energy per person-distance than a personal automobile. Modern [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient technologies]], such as [[plug-in hybrid]] electric vehicles and [[carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral synthetic gasoline &amp; Jet fuel]] may also help to reduce the consumption of [[petroleum]], land use changes and emissions of [[carbon dioxide]]. Utilizing [[rail transport]], especially electric rail, over the far less efficient [[environmental impact of aviation|air transport]] and [[road transport|truck transport]]
significantly reduces emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Urban planning===
{{Main|Urban planning}}

Effective [[urban planning]] to reduce [[urban sprawl|sprawl]] aims to decrease Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT), lowering emissions from transportation. Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Between 1982 and 1997, the amount of land consumed for [[urban development]] in the United States increased by 47 percent while the nation's population grew by only 17 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.

At the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.

Approaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through "medium-density", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.&lt;!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book "Sustainability and Cities" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.--&gt;

Smarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.

====Building design====
{{Main|Sustainable architecture|Green building}}

Emissions from [[house|housing]] are substantial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/climatechange/stats/homeenvironment/ |title=Energy Saving Trust: Home and the environment |publisher=[[Energy Saving Trust]] |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

For institutions of higher learning in the United States, greenhouse gas emissions depend primarily on total area of buildings and secondarily on climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fetcher|first=Ned|title=Effects of climate and institution size on greenhouse gas emissions from colleges and universities in the United States|journal=Sustainability: The Journal of Record|date=December 2009|volume=2|issue=6|pages=362–67|doi=10.1089/SUS.2009.9820}}&lt;/ref&gt; If climate is not taken into account, annual greenhouse gas emissions due to energy consumed on campuses plus purchased electricity can be estimated with the formula, ''E=aS''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''a'' =0.001621 metric tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent/square foot or 0.0241 metric tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent/square meter and ''b''= 1.1354.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Colleges and Universities|url=http://www.wilkes.edu/pages/4243.asp|accessdate=2 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106105803/http://www.wilkes.edu/pages/4243.asp|archive-date=2011-01-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources. Existing buildings can be made more efficient through the use of insulation, high-efficiency appliances (particularly [[hot water heater]]s and [[furnaces]]), [[insulated glazing|double- or triple-glazed gas-filled windows]], external window shades, and building orientation and siting. Renewable heat sources such as [[geothermal heat pump|shallow geothermal]] and [[passive solar]] energy reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted. In addition to designing buildings which are more energy-efficient to heat, it is possible to design buildings that are more energy-efficient to cool by using lighter-coloured, more reflective materials in the development of urban areas (e.g. by painting roofs white) and planting trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Agriculture===
{{See also|Climate change and agriculture}}
According to the [[EPA]], agricultural [[soil management]] practices can lead to production and emission of [[nitrous oxide]] (N2O), a major [[greenhouse gas]] and air pollutant. Activities that can contribute to {{chem|N|2|O}} emissions include [[fertilizer]] usage, [[irrigation]], and [[tillage]]. The management of soils accounts for over half of the emissions from the Agriculture sector. Cattle livestocks account for one third of emissions, through methane emissions. Manure management and rice cultivation also produce gaseous emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources/agriculture.html|title=Agriculture: Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions|year=2015|publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Societal controls===
{{Main|Personal carbon credits}}

Another method being examined is to make carbon a new currency by introducing tradeable "[[personal carbon credits]]". The idea being it will encourage and motivate individuals to reduce their 'carbon footprint' by the way they live. Each citizen will receive a free annual quota of carbon that they can use to travel, buy food, and go about their business. It has been suggested that by using this concept it could actually solve two problems; pollution and poverty, old age pensioners will actually be better off because they fly less often, so they can cash in their quota at the end of the year to pay heating bills and so forth.{{citation needed|reason=previous source deadlink|date=April 2009}}

==Costs and benefits==
{{Main|Economics of climate change mitigation}}

===Costs===
The [[Stern Review]] proposes stabilising the concentration of greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere at a maximum of 550ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e by 2050. The Review estimates that this would mean cutting total greenhouse-gas emissions to three quarters of 2007 levels. The Review further estimates that the cost of these cuts would be in the range −1.0 to +3.5% of World [[GDP]], (i.e. [[Gross world product|GWP]]), with an average estimate of approximately 1%.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt; Stern has since revised his estimate to 2% of GWP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/26/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange |title=Cost of tackling global climate change has doubled, warns Stern |first= Juliette |last=Jowit |first2= Patrick |last2=Wintour |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 June 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the Gross World Product (GWP) at [[purchasing power parity|PPP]] was estimated at $74.5 trillion in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title= CIA World Factbook |publisher= US [[CIA]] |date= 18 Oct 2011
|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html
|accessdate= 21 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus 2% is approximately $1.5 trillion. The Review emphasises that these costs are contingent on steady reductions in the cost of low-carbon technologies. Mitigation costs will also vary according to how and when emissions are cut: early, well-planned action will minimise the costs.&lt;ref name="stern"&gt;Stern, N. (2006). ''Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change: Part III: The Economics of Stabilisation.'' HM Treasury, London: http://hm-treasury.gov.uk/sternreview_index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

One way of estimating the cost of reducing emissions is by considering the likely costs of potential technological and output changes. Policy makers can compare the [[marginal abatement costs]] of different methods to assess the cost and amount of possible abatement over time. The marginal abatement costs of the various measures will differ by country, by sector, and over time.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt;

===Benefits===

This was judged to be especially the case when combined with enhanced adaptation. By 2100, however, it was still judged likely that there would be significant [[effects of global warming]]. This was judged to be the case even with aggressive mitigation and significantly enhanced [[adaptive capacity]].

|doi=10.2277/0521568544|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wealth, as measured by per capita income (i.e., income per head of population), varies widely between different countries. Activities of the poor that involve emissions of GHGs are often associated with basic needs, such as [[heating]] to stay tolerably warm. In richer countries, emissions tend to be associated with things like [[car]]s, [[central heating]], etc. The impacts of cutting emissions could therefore have different impacts on human [[welfare economics|welfare]] according to wealth.

====Distributing emissions abatement costs====
There have been different proposals on how to allocate responsibility for cutting emissions (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–105):&lt;ref name=banuri/&gt;
*'''[[Egalitarianism]]''': this system interprets the problem as one where each person has equal rights to a global resource, i.e., polluting the atmosphere.
*'''Basic needs''': this system would have emissions allocated according to basic needs, as defined according to a minimum level of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.
*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the "polluter-pays principle", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:
**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;29).&lt;ref name=goldemberg&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-521-56854-8
|doi=10.2277/0521568544|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**''Comparable burdens and ability to pay'': with this approach, countries would reduce emissions based on comparable burdens and their ability to take on the costs of reduction. Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].
**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit from reducing their emissions.
**''Carbon inheritance'':&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Insurance companies should collect a carbon levy |journal=Nature |volume=549 |issue=7671 |pages=152-154 |first1=Anthony J. |last1=Webster |last2=Clarke |first2=Richard H. |year=2017 |doi=10.1038/549152a }}&lt;/ref&gt; Is the notion that we have inherited the (technological) benefits of past emissions, and those who benefit most from them should pay the most. An energy levy has been suggested as a proxy for technological development. Rather than allocating blame for historical emissions, an energy levy pays back the benefits these technologies have brought&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Insurance companies should collect a carbon levy |journal=Nature |volume=549 |issue=7671 |pages=152-154 |first1=Anthony J. |last1=Webster |last2=Clarke |first2=Richard H. |year=2017 |doi=10.1038/549152a }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Specific proposals====
*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;106),&lt;ref name=banuri/&gt; for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.
*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;106–107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.
*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;27).&lt;ref name=goldemberg/&gt; In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource. It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state's economy was dependent on that resource.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of these technologies aids mitigation and could result in substantial reductions in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Policies include targets for emissions reductions, increased use of renewable energy, and increased energy efficiency. It is often argued that the results of climate change are more damaging in poor nations, where infrastructures are weak and few social services exist. The [[Commitment to Development Index]] is one attempt to analyze rich country policies taken to reduce their disproportionate use of the global commons. Countries do well if their greenhouse gas emissions are falling, if their gas taxes are high, if they do not subsidize the fishing industry, if they have a low fossil fuel rate per capita, and if they control imports of illegally cut tropical timber.

===Kyoto Protocol===
{{Main|Kyoto Protocol}}

The main current international agreement on combating climate change is the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. On the 11th of December 1997 it was implemented by the 3rd conference of parties, which was coming together in kyoto, which came into force on 16 February 2005. The Kyoto Protocol is an [[wikt:amendment|amendment]] to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). [[List of Kyoto Protocol signatories|Countries that have ratified this protocol]] have committed to reduce their emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] and five other greenhouse gases, or engage in [[emissions trading]] if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases. For Kyoto reporting, governments are obliged to be told on the present state of the countries forests and the related ongoing processes.

; Views in the literature
There is disagreement among experts over whether or not the 2&amp;nbsp;°C target can be met.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, M., ''et al.'', Section 19.7.2: Limits to Mitigation, in: [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap19_FGDall.pdf Chapter 19: Emergent risks and key vulnerabilities] (archived [https://web.archive.org/web/20140701114626/http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap19_FGDall.pdf July 8 2014]), pp. 49–50, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG2 A|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Geden/Silke Beck: [http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n9/full/nclimate2309.html ''Renegotiating the global climate stabilization target''.] In: Nature Climate Change, 4, 2014, pp. 747–48&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to Anderson and Bows (2011),&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, K. &amp; Bows, A., 2011. [http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1934/20.full.pdf+html Beyond 'dangerous' climate change: emission scenarios for a new world]. Philos. Trans. Royal Society A.&lt;/ref&gt; "there is little to no chance" of meeting the target. On the other hand, according to Alcamo ''et al.'' (2013):&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alcamo|others|2013|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Policies adopted by parties to the UNFCCC are too weak to meet a 2 or 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C target. However, these targets might still be achievable if more stringent mitigation policies are adopted immediately.
*Cost-effective 2&amp;nbsp;°C scenarios project annual global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before the year 2020, with deep cuts in emissions thereafter, leading to a reduction in 2050 of 41% compared to 1990 levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alcamo|others|2013|pp=xiii–xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Discussion on other targets
Scientific analysis can provide information on the impacts of climate change and associated policies, such as reducing GHG emissions. However, deciding what policies are best requires value judgements.&lt;ref name="wg 2 ch19 dangerous climate change"/&gt; For example, limiting global warming to 1&amp;nbsp;°C relative to pre-industrial levels may help to reduce climate change damages more than a 2&amp;nbsp;°C limit.&lt;ref&gt;"Implication for Carbon Emissions Target," in: {{harvnb|Hansen|others|2013|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 1&amp;nbsp;°C limit may be more costly to achieve than a 2&amp;nbsp;°C limit.&lt;ref&gt;"4. Discussion and conclusions," in: {{harvnb|Luderer|others|2013|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some analysts, the 2&amp;nbsp;°C "guardrail" is inadequate for the needed degree and timeliness of mitigation.&lt;ref name="existing policies inadequate"&gt;*[http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/radical-emission-reduction-conference The Radical Emissions Reduction Conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119103001/http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/radical-emission-reduction-conference |date=2017-01-19 }}, 2013.

; Official long-term target of 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C
In 2015, two official UNFCCC scientific expert bodies came to the conclusion that, "in some regions and vulnerable ecosystems, high risks are projected even for warming above 1.5°C".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Encouraging use changes===

====Emissions tax====
{{See also|carbon tax|energy tax|fee and dividend}}

An emissions tax on greenhouse gas emissions requires individual emitters to pay a fee, charge or tax for every tonne of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"&gt;{{cite book

|accessdate=2010-03-18|display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most environmentally related taxes with implications for greenhouse gas emissions in OECD countries are levied on energy products and motor vehicles, rather than on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions directly.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt;

Emission taxes can be both cost-effective and environmentally effective.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt; Difficulties with emission taxes include their potential unpopularity, and the fact that they cannot guarantee a particular level of emissions reduction.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt; Emissions or energy taxes also often fall disproportionately on lower income classes. In developing countries, institutions may be insufficiently developed for the collection of emissions fees from a wide variety of sources.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt;

====Subsidies====
According to [[Mark Z. Jacobson]], a program of subsidization balanced against expected flood costs could pay for conversion to 100% renewable power by 2030.&lt;ref name="wws-review"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Jacobson |first1= M.Z. |year= 2009 |title= Review of solutions to global warming, air pollution, and energy security |url= http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/PDF%20files/ReviewSolGW09.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100424234910/http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/PDF%20files/ReviewSolGW09.pdf |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2010-04-24 |format= PDF |journal= Energy and Environmental Science |volume= 2 |issue= 2 |pages= 148–73 |doi= 10.1039/b809990c|citeseerx= 10.1.1.180.4676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobson, and his colleague Mark Delucchi, suggest that the cost to generate and transmit power in 2020 will be less than 4 cents per kilowatt hour (in 2007 dollars) for wind, about 4 cents for wave and hydroelectric, from 4 to 7 cents for geothermal, and 8 cents per kWh for solar, fossil, and nuclear power.&lt;ref name=wws&gt;{{cite journal|last1= [[Mark Z. Jacobson|Jacobson]]|first1= M.Z.|last2= Delucchi|first2= M.A.|year= 2009|title= A Plan to Power 100 Percent of the Planet with Renewables" (originally published as "A Path to Sustainable Energy by 2030")|url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-path-to-sustainable-energy-by-2030|journal= [[Scientific American]]|volume= 301|issue= 5 |pages= 58–65|pmid= 19873905|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1109-58|bibcode= 2009SciAm.301e..58J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Investment====
{{See also|Fossil fuel divestment}}

Another indirect method of encouraging uses of renewable energy, and pursue sustainability and environmental protection, is that of prompting investment in this area through legal means, something that is already being done at national level as well as in the field of international investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=Journal of World Energy Law and Business|date=2015|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=2695579|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbon emissions trading====
{{Main|Carbon emissions trading}}

With the creation of a [[market (economics)|market]] for [[carbon emissions trading|trading carbon dioxide emissions]] within the Kyoto Protocol, it is likely that London financial markets will be the centre for this potentially highly lucrative business; the [[NYSE|New York]] and [[Chicago]] stock markets may have a lower trade volume than expected as long as the US maintains its rejection of the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/focus/story/0,,1509761,00.html How high-pressure politics threatens action on climate] The Observer June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

However, emissions trading may delay the phase-out of fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;''StoryOfStuff.com'' (2009) [http://storyofstuff.com/capandtrade/ "The Story of Cap and Trade"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722034154/http://www.storyofstuff.com/capandtrade/ |date=2010-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the north-east United States, a successful cap and trade program has shown potential for this solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceprogress.org/2013/02/success-of-northeast-cap-and-trade-system-shows-market-based-climate-policy-is-well-within-reach/|title=Success of Northeast Cap-and-Trade System Shows Market-Based Climate Policy Is Well Within Reach|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission.htm Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS)] from ''ec.europa.eu''&lt;/ref&gt; is the largest multi-national, greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world. It commenced operation on 1 January 2005, and all 28 member states of the [[European Union]] participate in the scheme which has created a new market in carbon dioxide allowances estimated at 35&amp;nbsp;billion Euros (US$43&amp;nbsp;billion) per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/2570.jsp The $20,000,000,000,000 question] ''Robins, Nick'' for Opendemocracy&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] was the first (voluntary) emissions market, and is soon to be followed by Asia's first market ([[Asia Carbon Exchange]]). A total of 107 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent have been exchanged through projects in 2004, a 38% increase relative to 2003 (78 Mt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e).&lt;ref&gt;[http://carbonfinance.org/docs/CarbonMarketStudy2005.pdf State and Trends of the Carbon Market] International Emissions Trading Association 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty three [[multinational corporation]]s have come together in the [[G8 Climate Change Roundtable]], a business group formed at the January 2005 [[World Economic Forum]]. The group includes [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Toyota]], [[British Airways]], and [[BP]]. On 9 June 2005 the Group published a statement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf Statement of G8 Climate Change Roundtable] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508123035/http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf |date=May 8, 2013}} Convened by the World Economic Forum June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; stating that there was a need to act on climate change and claiming that market-based solutions can help. It called on governments to establish "clear, transparent, and consistent price signals" through "creation of a long-term policy framework" that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases.

The [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] is a proposed carbon trading scheme being created by nine North-eastern and Mid-Atlantic [[United States|American]] states; [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]]. The scheme was due to be developed by April 2005 but has not yet been completed.

===Implementation===
Implementation puts into effect climate change mitigation strategies and targets. These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon&lt;/ref&gt;

====Funding====
Implementation requires funding sources but is often beset by disputes over who should provide funds and under what conditions.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; A lack of funding can be a barrier to successful strategies as there are no formal arrangements to finance climate change development and implementation.&lt;ref name="IHDP"&gt;Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat. P, Klostermann.J.E.M (unpublished) Institutional governance barriers for the development and implementation of climate adaptation strategies, Working paper for the International Human Dimensions Programme (IHDP) conference "Earth System Governance: People, Places, and the Planet", December 2–4, Amsterdam, the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; Funding is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Mee. L. D, Dublin. H. T, Eberhard. A. A (2008) Evaluating the Global Environment Facility: A goodwill gesture or a serious attempt to deliver global benefits?, Global Environmental Change 18, 800–810&lt;/ref&gt;

====Problems====
There are numerous issues which result in a current perceived lack of implementation.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; It has been suggested that the main barriers to implementation are Uncertainty, Fragmentation, Institutional void, Short time horizon of policies and politicians and Missing motives and willingness to start adapting. The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.&lt;ref name="IHDP"/&gt; The issues that arise with a system which involves international government cooperation, such as [[emissions trading|cap and trade]], could potentially be improved with a polycentric approach where the rules are enforced by many small sections of authority as opposed to one overall enforcement agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www10.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/pe/2009/04268.pdf |title=A Polycentric Approach for Coping with Climate Change |publisher=World Bank |date=October 2009 |author=Elinor Ostrom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101164212/http://www10.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/pe/2009/04268.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-01 |series=Policy Research Working Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about metal requirement and/or availability for essential decarbonization technoloqies such as [[photovoltaics]], [[nuclear power]], and (plug-in hybrid) [[electric vehicle]]s have also been expressed as obstacles.&lt;ref name="Tokimatsu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tokimatsu|first1=Koji|last2=Wachtmeister|first2=Henrik|last3=McLellan|first3=Benjamin|last4=Davidsson|first4=Simon|last5=Murakami|first5=Shinsuke|last6=Höök|first6=Mikael|last7=Yasuoka|first7=Rieko|last8=Nishio|first8=Masahiro|title=Energy modeling approach to the global energy-mineral nexus: A first look at metal requirements and the 2 °C target|journal=Applied Energy|date=December 2017|volume=207|pages=494–509|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.05.151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occurrence====
Despite a perceived lack of occurrence, evidence of implementation is emerging internationally. Some examples of this are the initiation of NAPA's and of joint implementation. Many developing nations have made National Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPAs) which are frameworks to prioritize adaption needs.&lt;ref name="EMJ"&gt;Preston. B. L, Westaway. R. M, Yuen. E. Y (2004) Climate adaptation planning in practice: an evaluation of adaptation plans from three developed nations, European Management Journal, 22(3) 304–314&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of many of these is supported by GEF agencies.&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (2011) Report on the twentieth meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group, Subsidiary Body for Implementation, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt; Many developed countries are implementing 'first generation' institutional adaption plans particularly at the state and local government scale.&lt;ref name="EMJ"/&gt; There has also been a push towards joint implementation between countries by the UNFCCC as this has been suggested as a cost-effective way for objectives to be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (2011) Annual report of the Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Main|Climate change in the United States}}
Efforts to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions by the United States]] include [[energy policy of the United States|energy policies]] which encourage efficiency through programs like [[Energy Star]], [[Commercial Building Integration]], and the [[Industrial Technologies Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/index.html |title=Industrial Technologies Program: BestPractices |publisher=Eere.energy.gov |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November 1998, Vice President [[Al Gore]] symbolically signed the Kyoto Protocol, but he indicated participation by the developing nations was necessary prior its being submitted for ratification by the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/12/11/kyoto/ |date=1997-12-11 |title=Clinton Hails Global Warming Pact|work= All Politics|publisher= CNN|accessdate=2006-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Transportation Secretary [[Mary Peters (politician)|Mary Peters]], with White House approval, urged governors and dozens of members of the House of Representatives to block California's first-in-the-nation limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks, according to e-mails obtained by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/09/25/4099/ "How the White House Worked to Scuttle California's Climate Law"], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], September 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Climate Change Science Program|US Climate Change Science Program]] is a group of about twenty federal agencies and US Cabinet Departments, all working together to address global warming.

The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] pressured American scientists to suppress discussion of global warming, according to the testimony of the Union of Concerned Scientists to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee of the US House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Reuters, January 30, 2007, free archived version at http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0130-10.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202012017/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0130-10.htm |date=2007-02-02 }}, last visited Jan. 30, '07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Written testimony of Dr. Grifo before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the US House of Representatives on January 30, 2007, archived at {{cite web|url=http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113153-55829.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805213620/http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20070130113153-55829.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-05 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "High-quality science" was "struggling to get out," as the Bush administration pressured scientists to tailor their writings on global warming to fit the Bush administration's skepticism, in some cases at the behest of an ex-oil industry lobbyist. "Nearly half of all respondents perceived or personally experienced pressure to eliminate the words 'climate change,' 'global warming' or other similar terms from a variety of communications." Similarly, according to the testimony of senior officers of the [[Government Accountability Project]], the White House attempted to bury the report "National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change," produced by US scientists pursuant to US law.&lt;ref&gt;written testimony of Rick Piltz before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the US House of Representatives on January 30, 2007, archived at {{cite web |url=http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113813-92288.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070131202854/http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113813-92288.pdf |archivedate=2007-01-31 |df=}} last visited Jan. 30, 07&lt;/ref&gt; Some US scientists resigned their jobs rather than give in to White House pressure to underreport global warming.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;

In the absence of substantial federal action, state governments have adopted emissions-control laws such as the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] in the Northeast and the [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]] in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/science/earth/in-california-a-grand-experiment-to-rein-in-climate-change.html |work=The New York Times |first=Felicity |last=Barringer |title=In California, a Grand Experiment to Rein in Climate Change |date=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developing countries====
In order to reconcile [[economic development]] with mitigating carbon emissions, [[developing countries]] need particular support, both financial and technical. One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund&lt;ref&gt;[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.

An important point of contention, however, is how overseas development assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&amp;title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&amp;nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];
# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;
# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and
# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.
The main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

However, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.

In an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] "which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&amp;Cr=trade&amp;Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-governmental approaches==
While many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.

===Choices in personal actions and business operations===
Environmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]]. Common recommendations include lowering home heating and cooling usage, burning less gasoline, supporting renewable [[energy sources]], buying local products to reduce transportation, turning off unused devices, and various others.

A [[geophysicist]] at [[Utrecht University]] has urged similar institutions to hold the vanguard in voluntary mitigation, suggesting the use of communications technologies such as [[videoconferencing]] to reduce their dependence on long-haul flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Air travel and shipment====
In 2008, climate scientist [[Kevin Anderson (scientist)|Kevin Anderson]] raised concern about the growing effect of rapidly increasing global air transport on the climate in a paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|quote= (esp. slide 24 onward)}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that reversing this trend is necessary to reduce emissions.

Part of the difficulty is that when [[environmental impact of aviation|aviation emissions]] are made at high altitude, the climate impacts are much greater than otherwise. Others have been raising the related concerns of the increasing [[hypermobility (travel)|hypermobility]] of individuals, whether traveling for business or pleasure, involving frequent and often long distance air travel, as well as air shipment of goods.&lt;ref name="gossling"&gt;Gössling S, Ceron JP, Dubois G, Hall CM, Gössling IS, Upham P, [[Earthscan]] London (2009). Hypermobile travellers. and Implications for Carbon Dioxide Emissions Reduction. In: Climate Change and Aviation: Issues, Challenges and Solutions, London. The chapter: ''[https://alicante.academia.edu/documents/0076/1866/chap06_copy.pdf Chapter 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619151427/http://alicante.academia.edu/documents/0076/1866/chap06_copy.pdf |date=2010-06-19}}''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business opportunities and risks===
{{Main|Business action on climate change}}

On 9 May 2005 [[Jeff Immelt]], the [[chief executive]] of [[General Electric]] (GE), announced plans to reduce GE's global warming related emissions by one percent by 2012. "GE said that given its projected growth, those emissions would have risen by 40 percent without such action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7791657/ |title=Green Electric? GE unveils eco-strategy |publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2005 a group of leading [[airline]]s, [[airport]]s, and [[aerospace]] [[manufacturer]]s pledged to work together to reduce the negative [[environmental impact of aviation]], including limiting the impact of air travel on climate change by improving [[fuel efficiency]] and reducing carbon dioxide emissions of new aircraft by fifty percent per seat kilometre by 2020 from 2000 levels. The group aims to develop a common reporting system for carbon dioxide emissions per aircraft by the end of 2005, and pressed for the early inclusion of aviation in the [[European Union]]'s carbon emission trading scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/747d20ea-e1ff-11d9-bf18-00000e2511c8.html |title=Aviation groups set targets to limit their environmental impact |publisher=FT.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investor response===
{{Main|Fossil fuel divestment}}
Climate change is also a concern for large institutional investors who have a long term time horizon and potentially large exposure to the negative impacts of global warming because of the large geographic footprint of their multi-national holdings. SRI ([[Socially responsible investing]]) Funds allow investors to invest in funds that meet high ESG (environmental, social, governance) standards as such funds invest in companies that are aligned with these goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kiplinger.com/article/investing/T041-C016-S001-5-mutual-funds-for-socially-responsible-investors.html |title=5 Mutual Funds for Socially Responsible Investors |publisher=Kiplinger}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proxy firm]]s can be used to draft guidelines for [[investment manager]]s that take these concerns into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ussif.org/files/publications/institutional_climate.pdf |title=Investing to Curb Climate Change |publisher=USSIF |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal action===
{{See also|Duty to rescue}}

In some countries, those affected by climate change may be able to sue major producers. Attempts at litigation have been initiated by entire peoples such as Palau&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/video/video-paradise-lost/14421/|title=Video: Paradise lost? – Need to Know |publisher=PBS|quote=Palau suing the industrialized countries over global warming}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Inuit,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6908719/site/newsweek/ Inuit suing the US in regards to global warming] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825135526/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6908719/site/newsweek/ |date=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as non-governmental organizations such as the Sierra Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newson6.com/story/9138384/environmental-integrity-project-sierra-club-announce-plans-to-sue-epa-unless-it-revises-nitrogen-oxide-emissions-standard-curbs-nitrous-oxide?clienttype=printable|title=Environmental Integrity Project, Sierra Club Announce Plans to Sue EPA Unless It Revises Nitrogen Oxide Emissions Standard, Curbs Nitrous Oxide Pollution Linked to Global Warming – NewsOn6.com – Tulsa, OK – News, Weather, Video and Sports – KOTV.com -|publisher=|access-date=2013-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111204839/http://www.newson6.com/story/9138384/environmental-integrity-project-sierra-club-announce-plans-to-sue-epa-unless-it-revises-nitrogen-oxide-emissions-standard-curbs-nitrous-oxide?clienttype=printable|archive-date=2016-01-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although proving that particular weather events are due specifically to global warming may never be possible,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lorenz (1982): "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get"&lt;/ref&gt; methodologies have been developed to show the increased risk of such events caused by global warming.&lt;ref&gt;Stott, et al. (2004), "Human contribution to the European heatwave of 2003", Nature, Vol. 432, 2 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

For a legal action for [[negligence]] (or similar) to succeed, "Plaintiffs ... must show that, more probably than not, their individual injuries were caused by the risk factor in question, as opposed to any other cause. This has sometimes been translated to a requirement of a relative risk of at least two."&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Columbia J. of Env. Law, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Another route (though with little legal bite) is the [[World Heritage Convention]], if it can be shown that climate change is affecting [[World Heritage Site]]s like [[Mount Everest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heatisonline.org/contentserver/objecthandlers/index.cfm?id=4950&amp;method=full |title=Climate change 'ruining' Everest |publisher=Heatisonline.org |date=2004-11-17 |access-date=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2004/11/041117_climate-belize.shtml Climate change 'ruining' Belize] BBC November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides countries suing one another, there are also cases where people in a country have taken legal steps against their own government. Legal action for instance has been taken to try to force the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatelaw.org/cases Climate Justice] Ongoing Cases&lt;/ref&gt; and against the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] and [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation|OPIC]] for failing to assess environmental impacts (including global warming impacts) under [[NEPA]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

In the Netherlands and Belgium, organisations such as [[Urgenda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/24/dutch-government-ordered-cut-carbon-emissions-landmark-ruling|title=Dutch government ordered to cut carbon emissions in landmark ruling|first=Arthur Neslen The|last=Hague|date=24 June 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urgenda.nl/themas/klimaat-en-energie/klimaatzaak/|title=Klimaat en Energie – Thema's – Urgenda – Samen Sneller Duurzaam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tegenlicht.vpro.nl/afleveringen/2015-2016/de-klimaatzaak.html|title=VPRO Tegenlicht|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[vzw Klimaatzaak]] in Belgium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/binnenland/2.36678|title=Klimaatzaak|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://klimaatzaak.eu/nl/about/|title=Over ons – Klimaatzaak|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also sued their governments as they believe their governments aren't meeting the emission reductions they agreed to. Urgenda have already won their case against the Dutch government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

According to a 2004 study commissioned by [[Friends of the Earth]], [[ExxonMobil]], and its predecessors caused 4.7 to 5.3 percent of the world's man-made carbon dioxide emissions between 1882 and 2002. The group suggested that such studies could form the basis for eventual legal action.&lt;ref&gt;Press release (29 January 2004). [http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/exxonmobils_contribution_t_28012004.html Archived press release: Exxonmobil's contribution to global warming revealed]. Friends of the Earth Trust. Retrieved May 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Exxon]] received a subpoena. According to the ''Washington Post'' and confirmed by the company, the attorney general of New York, [[Eric Schneiderman]], opened an investigation into the possibility that the company had misled the public and investors about the risks of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/11/05/exxonmobil-under-investigation-for-misleading-the-public-about-climate-change/ |title=New York is investigating Exxon Mobil for allegedly misleading the public about climate change |publisher=The Washington Post |date=November 5, 2015 |access-date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A consumer-led response to climate change===

Low carbon investment and [[ethical banking]] has been suggested as a tactic to allow consumers to drive a low-carbon transition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A.J.Webster|title=A global consumer-led strategy to tackle climate change|date=July 2018|url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03364}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Roughly 5% of OECD disposable income is saved[https://data.oecd.org/hha/household-savings.htm], and could alternately be saved in low-carbon investment funds to substantially increase overall low-carbon investment. 

Voluntarily funded, low-carbon investment funds have been suggested as a way to provide revenue for adaptation costs in the post-fossil fuel era&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A.J.Webster|title=A global consumer-led strategy to tackle climate change|date=July 2018|url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03364}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is suggested that voluntary donations can be invested, rather than spent, and long-term returns used to pay for adaptation costs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4925">In [[rhetoric]], a '''climax''' ({{lang-grc-gre|κλῖμαξ}}, ''klîmax'', &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"staircase" or "ladder") is a [[figure of speech]] in which [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, or [[clause]]s are arranged in order of increasing importance.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 57&lt;br&gt;Baldick, 2008. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smyth | first = Herbert Weir | year = 1920 | title = Greek Grammar | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge MA | isbn = 0-674-36250-0 | page = 677}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its use with clauses, it is also sometimes known as '''[[auxesis (rhetoric)|auxesis]]''' (&lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"growth").&lt;ref&gt;Baldick, 2008. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
__NOTOC__
==Usage==
Climax is frequently used in [[persuasion]] (particularly [[advertising]]) to create [[false dilemma]]s and to focus attention on the positive aspects of the subject at hand. The initial inferior options make the final term seem still better by comparison than it would appear in isolation: "X is good, Y is better, Z is best" is a standard format. It can also be used in reverse to make the initial term seem better by comparison: "A isn't perfect but B is worse and C is worst."&lt;!--Rather use?: &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/techniques/language/figures_speech/auxesis.htm|title=Auxesis|website=changingminds.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://changingminds.org/techniques/language/figures_speech/auxesis.htm 1].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Rather use?: &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-use-the-simple-power-of-contrast-to-become-a-more-persuasive-online-marketer/|title=How to Use the Simple Power of Contrast to Become More Persuasive - Copyblogger|date=2007-04-30|work=Copyblogger|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-use-the-simple-power-of-contrast-to-become-a-more-persuasive-online-marketer/ 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* "There are three things that will endure: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love."&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians 13:13&lt;/ref&gt;
* "I think we've reached a point of great decision, not just for our nation, not only for all humanity, but for life upon the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wald |first=George |author-link=George Wald |title=A Generation in Search of a Future |date=4 March 1969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "...Lost, vaded, broken, dead within an hour."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Shakespeare |first=William |author-link=William Shakespeare |title=The Passionate Pilgrim, ''XIII'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Anticlimax==
An '''anticlimax''' or '''anti-climax''' is an abrupt descent (either deliberate or unintended) on the part of a speaker or writer from the dignity of idea which he appeared to be aiming at,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=123}} as in:

:"The English poet Herrick expressed the same sentiment when he suggested that we should gather rosebuds while we may. Your elbow is in the butter, sir."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=P.G. |last=Wodehouse |title=Much Obliged, Jeeves }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a relative term, anticlimax requires a greater or lesser climax to precede it in order to have proper effect. An anticlimax can be intentionally employed only for a jocular or satiric purpose. It frequently partakes of the nature of [[antithesis]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=123}} as in:

:"Die and endow a ''college'' or a ''cat''."

[[File:Clonal colony of Iris germanica.jpg|thumb|right|A clonal colony of ''[[Iris germanica]]''-note the [[Rhizome|rhizomatious]] stems by which the plant reproduces.]]
A '''clonal colony''' or '''genet''' is a group of [[genetics|genetically]] identical individuals, such as [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], or [[bacteria]], that have grown in a given location, all originating [[vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]], not [[Sexual reproduction|sexually]], from a single ancestor. In plants, an individual in such a population is referred to as a '''ramet'''. In [[fungi]], "individuals" typically refers to the visible [[fruiting bodies]] or [[mushroom]]s that develop from a common [[mycelium]] which, although spread over a large area, is otherwise hidden in the [[soil]]. Clonal [[colony (biology)|colonies]] are common in many plant [[species]]. Although many plants [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]] through the production of [[seed]], [[plant reproduction|reproduction]] occurs by underground [[stolon]]s or [[rhizome]]s in some plants. Above ground, these plants most often appear to be distinct individuals, but underground they remain interconnected and are all clones of the same plant. However, it is not always easy to recognize a clonal colony especially if it spreads underground and is also sexually reproducing.

==Methods of establishment==
* With most [[woody plant]]s, clonal colonies arise by wide-ranging [[root]]s that at intervals send up new [[shoot]]s, termed [[basal shoot|suckers]].  
* [[Tree]]s and [[shrub]]s with [[branch]]es that may tend to bend and rest on the ground, or which possess the ability to form [[aerial root|aerial roots]] can form colonies via [[layering]], or aerial rooting, e. g. [[willow]], [[blackberry]], [[Ficus|fig]], and [[banyan]]. 
* Some [[vine]]s naturally form [[adventitious]] roots on their [[plant stem|stems]] that take root in the soil when the stems contact the ground, e.g. [[Hedera|ivy]] and [[trumpet vine]].
* With other vines, rooting of the stem where nodes come into contact with soil may establish a clonal colony, e.g. [[Wisteria]].
* [[Fern]]s and many [[herbaceous]] [[flowering plant]]s often form clonal colonies via horizontal underground stems termed [[rhizome]]s, e.g. ostrich fern ''[[Matteuccia struthiopteris]]'' and [[goldenrod]].
* A number of herbaceous flowering plants form clonal colonies via horizontal surface stems termed [[stolon]]s, or runners; e.g. [[strawberry]] and many [[grass]]es.
* Non-woody plants with underground [[storage organ]]s such as [[bulb]]s and [[corm]]s can also form colonies, e.g. ''[[Narcissus (genus)|Narcissus]]'' and ''[[Crocus]]''.
* A few plant species can form colonies via adventitious [[plantlet]]s that form on leaves, e.g. ''[[Kalanchoe daigremontiana]]'' and ''[[Tolmiea menziesii]]''.
* A few plant species can form colonies via asexual seeds, termed [[apomixis]], e.g. [[dandelion]].

==Record colonies==
The only known natural example of [[King's Lomatia]] (''Lomatia tasmanica'') found growing in the wild is a clonal colony in [[Tasmania]] estimated to be 43,600 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exn.ca/Stories/1996/10/21/01.asp |title=Tasmanian bush could be oldest living organism |accessdate=2008-05-07 |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723041627/http://www.exn.ca/Stories/1996/10/21/01.asp |archivedate=2006-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A group of 47,000 [[Quaking Aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides'') trees (nicknamed "[[Pando (tree)|Pando]]") in the [[Wasatch Mountains]], [[Utah]], United States, has been shown to be a single clone connected by the root system. It is sometimes considered the world's [[largest organism]] by [[mass]], covering {{convert|106|acres}}, and also as amongst the world's oldest living organisms, at an estimated 80,000 years old.  It is possible that other unknown clonal colonies of trees rival or exceed its size and/ or age.

Another possible candidate for [[list of long-living organisms|oldest organism]] on [[earth]] is an underwater meadow of the [[marine botany|marine plant]] ''[[Posidonia oceanica]]'' in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], which could be up to 100,000 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiza-spotlight.com/node/76071 |title=Ibiza's Monster Marine Plant |accessdate=2008-05-07 |publisher=Ibiza Spotlight }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
When woody plants form clonal colonies, they often remain connected through the root system, sharing roots, water and [[plant nutrition|mineral nutrients]]. A few non-vining, woody plants that form clonal colonies are:
*[[Aspen]], Quaking, ''Populus tremuloides''
*[[Bayberry]], ''Myrica pensylvanica''
*[[Black locust]], ''Robinia pseudoacacia''
*[[Creosote bush]], ''Larrea tridentata'' 
*[[Staphylea|Bladdernut]], ''Staphylea'' species
*[[Blueberry]], ''Vaccinium'' species
*[[Devil's Club]] Oplopanax horridus
*[[Forsythia]], ''Forsythia'' species
*[[Hazelnut]], ''Corylus'' species
*[[Honey locust]], ''Gleditsia triacanthos''
*[[Kentucky coffeetree]], ''Gymnocladus dioicus''
*[[Kerria (plant)|Kerria]], ''Kerria japonica''
*[[Asimina triloba|Pawpaw]], ''Asimina triloba''
*[[Pando (tree)|Pando tree]], a clonal colony of a single male ''Populus tremuloides'', all determined to be part of a single living organism
*[[Populus|Poplar]]s, ''Populus'' species

A '''concordance''' is an alphabetical list of the principal words used in a book or body of work, listing every instance of each word with its immediate [[context (language use)#Verbal context|context]]. Only works of special importance have had concordances prepared for them, such as the [[Vedas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Maurice | last = Bloomfield| authorlink = Maurice Bloomfield | title = A Vedic Concordance| year  = 1990| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ| isbn = 81-208-0654-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bible]], [[Qur'an]] or the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[James Joyce]] or classical Latin and Greek authors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Roy | last = Wisbey | authorlink = Roy Wisbey | title = Concordance Making by Electronic Computer: Some Experiences with the Wiener Genesis| journal = The Modern Language Review | publisher = Modern Humanities Research Association | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 161–172 | date = April 1962 | doi=10.2307/3720960}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the time, difficulty, and expense involved in creating a concordance in the pre-[[computer]] era. 
[[File:Mordechai nathan hebrew latin concordance.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Mordecai Nathan's Hebrew-Latin Concordance of the Bible]]

A concordance is more than an index; additional material make producing them a labor-intensive process, even when assisted by computers, such as commentary, definitions, and topical cross-indexing.

In the precomputing era, [[search engine technology|search]] technology was unavailable, and a concordance offered readers of long works such as the Bible something comparable to search results for every word that they would have been likely to search for. Today, the ability to combine the result of queries concerning multiple terms (such as searching for words near other words) has reduced interest in concordance publishing. In addition, mathematical techniques such as [[latent semantic indexing]] have been proposed as a means of automatically identifying linguistic information based on word context.

A '''bilingual concordance''' is a concordance based on [[aligned parallel text]].

A '''topical concordance''' is a list of subjects that a book covers (usually The Bible), with the immediate context of the coverage of those subjects. Unlike a traditional concordance, the indexed word does not have to appear in the verse. The best-known topical concordance is [[Nave's Topical Bible]].

The first [[Bible concordance]] was compiled for the [[Vulgate]] Bible by [[Hugh of St Cher]] (d.1262), who employed 500 monks to assist him. In 1448, Rabbi Mordecai Nathan completed a concordance to the Hebrew Bible. It took him ten years. A concordance to the Greek New Testament was published in 1599 by [[Henri Estienne (elder)|Henry Stephens]], and the Septuagint was done a couple of years later by Conrad Kircher in 1602. The first concordance to the English Bible was published in 1550 by Mr Marbeck. According to Cruden, it did not employ the verse numbers devised by [[Robert Estienne|Robert Stephens]] in 1545, but "the pretty large concordance" of Mr Cotton did. Then followed [[Cruden's Concordance]] and [[Strong's Concordance]].

==Use in linguistics==
Concordances are frequently used in [[linguistics]], when studying a text. For example:
* comparing different usages of the same word
* analysing keywords
* analysing [[word frequencies]]
* finding and analysing phrases and [[idioms]]
* finding [[translation]]s of subsentential elements, e.g. [[terminology]], in [[Bitext#Bitexts and translation memories|bitexts and translation memories]]
* creating indexes and word lists (also useful for publishing)

Concordancing techniques are widely used in national [[text corpora]] such as [[American National Corpus]], [[British National Corpus]], and [[Corpus of Contemporary American English]] available on-line.  Stand-alone applications that employ concordancing techniques are known as [[Concordancer|concordancers]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexically.net/wordsmith/introduction.htm?gclid=COjFnvGKhakCFVJX4Qod-RqjjQ Introduction to WordSmith]&lt;/ref&gt; or more advanced [[corpus manager|corpus managers]]. Some of them have integrated [[Part of speech tagger|part-of-speech taggers]] and enable the user to create his/her own [[part of speech|POS]]-annotated corpora to conduct various type of searches adopted in corpus linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yatsko.zohosites.com/linguistic-toobox-a-concordancer.html Linguistic Toolbox]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inversion==

The reconstruction of the text of some of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] involved a concordance.

Access to some of the scrolls was governed by a "secrecy rule" that allowed only the original International Team or their designates to view the original materials. After the death of [[Roland de Vaux]] in 1971, his successors repeatedly refused to even allow the publication of photographs to other scholars. This restriction was circumvented by [[Martin Abegg]] in 1991, who used a computer to "invert" a concordance of the missing documents made in the 1950s which had come into the hands of scholars outside of the International Team, to obtain an approximate reconstruction of the original text of 17 of the documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Hawrysch |first= George |title= Dr. George Hawrysch's speech on concordance book launch |work= The Ukrainian Weekly, No. 31, Vol. LXX |publisher= Ukrainian National Association |date= 2002-08-04 |url= http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/2002/310217.shtml |accessdate= 2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Jillette |first= Penn |title= You May Already be a "Computer Expert" |url= http://pennandteller.com/sincity/penn-n-teller/pcc/deadsea.html |accessdate= 2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was soon followed by the release of the original text of the scrolls.

The '''Defence Scientific Information &amp; Documentation Centre''' (DESIDOC) is a division of the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO). Located in [[Delhi]], its main function is the collection, processing and dissemination of relevant technical information for DRDO scientists. The present director of DESIDOC is Ms. Alka Suri.

== History ==

DESIDOC started functioning in 1958 as Scientific Information Bureau (SIB). It was a division of the Defence Science Laboratory (DSL) which is now called Laser Science &amp; Technology Centre. The DRDO library which had its beginning in 1948 became a division of SIB in 1959. In 1967 SIB was reorganised with augmented activities and named Defence Scientific Information and Documentation Centre (DESIDOC). It still continued to function under the administrative control of DSL. DESIDOC became a self-accounting unit and one of the laboratories of DRDO on 29 July 1970.

The Centre was functioning in the main building of Metcalfe House, a landmark in Delhi and a national monument. In August 1988 it moved to its newly built five-storeyed building in the same Metcalfe House complex. Since it became a self-accounting unit, DESIDOC has been functioning as a central information resource for DRDO. It provides S&amp;T information, based on its library and other information resources, to the DRDO headquarters, and its various laboratories at various places in India.

== Functions ==

=== Library ===

DESIDOC maintains the Defence Science Library (DSL) is headed by Sh. V Senthil, Scientist E, a well-equipped library housing 262,000 documents. It also provides access to various databases, as well as newspaper archives and other reference material. Additionally, DESIDOC has taken up the initiative of digitizing complete research papers of DRDO scientists, as well as preparing presentation material and promotional material for DRDO scientists.

=== Publications ===

DESIDOC functions as the publication wing of DRDO, providing scientific and technical information via specialised publications, monographs, technical bulletins, online journals and popular science publications. These cover current developments in Indian Defence R&amp;D. The publications are unclassified and available free of charge online. Monographs and other publications are available on payment.

'''Delimiterless input''' is a special feature of some [[minicomputer]]s and all [[microcomputer]]s in which the computer can recognize and act upon a single character or keypress without requiring use of a "transmit" or "send" key.  Older mini and [[mainframe computer]]s generally operated on a line-at-a-time or screen-at-a-time basis.  The line was sent to the computer by pressing the return, enter, send or transmit key, depending on what the key was called.

==Line-at-a-time==
Editing of the typed-in line was done on the screen via the delete or backspace key, and the entire line was transmitted to the computer when the send key was pressed.

==Screen-at-a-time==
Mainframe computers such as IBM's [[System/370|370]] and the [[System 38]] used terminals such as the [[IBM 3270]] which transmitted an entire screen of information all at once as opposed to a line at a time.

==Efficiency gain==
Mini and mainframe computers tended to serve many users at one time, and using line-at-a-time or screen-at-a-time input is more efficient for the computer.  Most of the activity of a user of one of these machines is either reading output sent to them or waiting for input to be sent back to the running program, and thus other users could be served while the specific user was composing input.  Terminals connected to these machines had limited editing capability, and thus were sometimes referred to as [[dumb terminal]]s.

==Delimiterless input==
Minicomputers such as the [[PDP-11]], and microcomputers ("personal computers") such as the [[TRS-80]], [[Apple II]] and [[IBM-PC]] were able to implement delimiterless input as part of their design specification.  Microcomputers, generally having only one user connected to them, could afford to support the less efficient delimiterless input capability as keyboard input could be handled by less expensive circuitry than that used on more expensive machines.  This would then lead to the development of much more powerful [[computer game|games]] for personal computers.  While games existed even on some of the largest computers, most of them were written, same as any other program, to either operate on line-at-a-time or screen-at-a-time input.

{{canon Law}}
In the [[jurisprudence of canon law|jurisprudence]] of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], a '''dispensation''' is the exemption from the immediate obligation of law in certain cases.&lt;ref name=law284&gt;The Law of Christ Vol. I, pg. 284&lt;/ref&gt; Its object is to modify the hardship often arising from the rigorous application of general laws to particular cases, and its essence is to preserve the law by suspending its operation in such cases.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Dispensation |volume=8 |pages=313-315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Since [[law]]s aimed at the good of the entire community may not be suitable for certain cases or persons, the [[legislator]] has the right (sometimes even the duty) to dispense from{{refn|Unlike the English idiom "dispense with", the canonical idiom is "dispense from"|group=note}} the [[law]].&lt;ref name=law284/&gt;

Dispensation is not a permanent power or a special right as in [[privilege (canon law)|privilege]].&lt;ref name=law284/&gt; If the reason for the dispensation ceases entirely, then the dispensation also ceases entirely.&lt;ref name=law285&gt;The Law of Christ Vol. I, pg. 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P9.HTM Canon 93], 1983 Code of Canon Law, accessed June-5-2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NewAdvent.org [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05041a.htm "Dispensation"], accessed June-5-2013&lt;/ref&gt; If the immediate basis for the right is withdrawn, then the right ceases.&lt;ref name=law285/&gt;

===Validity, legality, "just and reasonable cause"===
There must be a "just and reasonable cause"&lt;ref name=can90&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P9.HTM Canon 90 §1], 1983 Code of Canon Law; accessed June-5-2013&lt;/ref&gt; for granting a dispensation. The judgement regarding what is "just and reasonable" is made based upon the particular situation and the importance of the law to be dispensed from.&lt;ref name=can90/&gt; If the cause is not "just and reasonable" then the dispensation is illegal and, if issued by someone other than the lawgiver of the law in question or his superior, it is also invalid.&lt;ref name=can90/&gt; If it is uncertain as to whether a sufficiently "just and reasonable cause" exists, the dispensation is both legal and valid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P9.HTM Canon 90 §2], 1983 Code of Canon Law; accessed June-5-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical legal theory]], the dispensing power is the corollary of the legislative. The dispensing power, like the legislative, was formerly invested in [[Ecumenical council|general councils]] and even in provincial [[synods]]. But in the west, with the gradual centralisation of authority in the [[Roman curia]], it became ultimately vested in the [[pope]] as the supreme lawgiver of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Despite frequent crises in the diplomatic relations between the [[Holy See]] and temporal governments in the later [[Middle Ages]], the authority of the papacy as the dispenser of [[Actual grace|grace]] and spiritual licences remained largely unchallenged. In the early thirteenth century, [[Pope Innocent III]] (1198–1216) fostered the extension of papal political power. He emphasised, "as had no pope before him, the pope's ''plenitudo potestatis'' ("fullness of power") within the Church." Since the Church comprised the whole of mankind, medieval jurists were accustomed to what we might call shared sovereignty, and freely accepted that the pope had a concurrent jurisdiction with temporal sovereigns.  The temporal princes could administer their own laws, but the princes of the Church, and especially the pope, administered the canon law (so far as it was subject to merely human control).

In the [[decretal]] ''Proposuit'', Innocent III proclaimed that the pope could, if circumstances demanded, dispense from canon law, ''de jure'', with his plenitude of power.  He based his view on ''princeps legibus solutus est'' ("the prince is not bound by the laws").  Because the pope was above the law, time or precedent did not limit his power, and he could dispense with any law.

Such a dispensation was not, strictly speaking, legislative, but rather a judicial, quasi-judicial, or executive act. It was also, of course, subject to the proviso that his jurisdiction to dispense with laws was limited to those laws which were within his jurisdiction or competence.  "[T]his principle would have been a commonplace to anyone who had studied in Bologna."

By this power of dispensation, the pope could release clergy and laity from the obligations of the canon law in all cases that were not contrary to ''[[Divine law|ius divinum]]'' and even in a few cases that were.  This power was most frequently invoked to enable laity to marry notwithstanding impediments of [[Affinity (law)|affinity]] or kinship, and to enable persons labouring under an irregularity (such as of [[bastardy]], servitude, or lack of age) to take orders or become regulars.

Dispensations awarded was classified into three categories:
*The first two categories, rules concerning the procedure of taking [[Holy Orders]], and dispensations concerning tenure of [[benefice]]s, applied only to clergy, and of release from [[religious vows]] for members of [[Catholic religious order]]s.
*The third category, matrimonial dispensations, i.e. regarding marriage, concerned only the laity since [[clerical celibacy|the clergy is celibate]].
*Beside the three main classes of dispensation, the [[Roman Curia]] was ready to grant miscellaneous positive concessions to applicants, from individuals to larger organisations, although the former is rare. This host of dispensations, [[faculty (instrument)|faculties]], and [[indult]]s included permission to eat flesh during [[Lent]], the celebration of offices in [[Chapel of ease|chapels of ease]] and private [[Oratory (worship)|oratories]], and the granting of academic degrees.  Those dispensations relating to academic degrees were mostly issued under the sanction of the canon law, as stated in the constitution of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] beginning ''Cum ex eo''.

==Contemporary use==
As of the early part of the twentieth century, the actual practice of the Roman Catholic Church is based upon the decisions of the [[Council of Trent]], which left the medieval theory intact while endeavouring to guard against its abuses. The proposal put forward by the Gallican and Spanish bishops to subordinate the papal power of dispensation to the consent of the Church in general council was rejected, and even the canons of the council of Trent itself, in so far as they affected reformation of morals or ecclesiastical discipline, were decreed “saving the authority of the Holy See” (Sess. xxv. cap. 21, de ref.). At the same time it was laid down in respect of all dispensations, whether papal or other, that they were to be granted only for just and urgent causes, or in view of some decided benefit to the Church (urgens justaque causa et major quandoque utilitas), and in all cases gratis. The payment of money for a dispensation was ipso facto to make the dispensation void (Sess. xxv. cap. 18, de ref.).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

There are several levels of authority in the Church that are competent to dispense the various demands of Canon Law.  Local [[ordinary (officer)|ordinaries]], for example, are competent to dispense the various [[canonical impediment]]s to the sacrament of marriage.  Some dispensations are reserved to the [[Holy See]], for example, from the impediment to ordination of [[apostasy]].

The power of dispensing lies with the original lawgiver, with his successors or with his superiors, and with those persons to whom they have delegated this right. Since there is no superior above the pope, he can therefore dispense from all [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical laws]]: universal laws introduced by himself, his predecessors or general councils, and particular laws enacted by plenary and provincial councils, bishops and similar prelates. As a general rule the [[pope]] delegates his powers to the various [[congregation (Roman Curia)|congregations]] of the [[Roman Curia]] which are charged with granting dispensations in matters within the sphere of their competence.&lt;ref name=whatis47&gt;"What is Canon Law?" pg. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papal dispensation===
Papal dispensation is a reserved right of the [[pope]] that allows for individuals to be exempted from a specific [[Canon Law]]. Dispensations are divided into two categories: general, and matrimonial. Matrimonial dispensations can be either to allow a marriage in the first place, or to dissolve one.  The authority for the pope to exempt an individual or situation from a law stems from his position as the Vicar of Christ, which implies divine authority and knowledge as well as jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05041a.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Dispensation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first marriage of [[Henry VIII of England]] to [[Catherine of Aragon]] required a papal dispensation as it breached canon law on [[Affinity (canon law)|Affinity]] because she was the widow of Henry's elder brother [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]].  This was obtained successfully, but when he later wished to divorce her, he was famously unable to get another one, causing his [[English Reformation|break with Rome]]. &lt;!-- cn --&gt;Their daughter [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], a fervent Catholic, would later apply for a secret dispensation absolving her of submitting to the basic rules of Protestant religion when pressured under the threat of death by her father.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--cn end--&gt;

In the earlier Middle Ages, especially the 11th to 12th centuries, the church had developed canon law on affinity and [[consanguinity]] (the first denoting a connection by marriage only, the second a genetic one) to cover very remote relationships, so that a very high proportion of marriages between the small and inter-related European elites needed expensive dispensations from either the Pope or a bishop.  This was recognised as an abuse, and later the relationships covered were reduced.  In 1059, the eleventh canon of the [[Council of Rome]] recognized the impediment of affinity as well as of consanguinity to extend to the seventh degree, the high point of the restrictions.  [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] in the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) limited both affinity and consanguinity needing dispensation to the fourth degree, and the [[Council of Trent]] (Sess. XXIV, c. iv, De Ref.) in the 16th century limited the juridical effect of extra-matrimonial intercourse to the second degree of affinity.

==Matrimonial dispensation==
A matrimonial dispensation is the relaxation in a particular case of an impediment prohibiting or annulling a marriage. It may be granted: (a) in favour of a contemplated marriage or to legitimize one already contracted; (b) in secret cases, or in public cases, or in both; (c) in foro interno only, or in foro externo (the latter includes also the former). Power of dispensing in foro interno is not always restricted to secret cases (casus occulti).
These expressions are by no means identical.

''The information in this section concerns [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] in the early 20th century. The canon law in question was considerably changed by the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)#Codification|1917 Code of Canon Law]] and the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] and should not be considered to reflect the present situation.''

=== General powers of dispensation ===
==== The Pope and his Curia ====
The Pope cannot dispense from impediments founded on [[Divine law]] — except, as above described, in the case of [[vows]], espousals and non-consummated marriages, or valid and consummated marriage of [[wikt:neophyte|neophyte]]s before [[baptism]]. In doubtful cases, however, he may decide authoritatively as to the objective value of the doubt. In respect of impediments arising from ecclesiastical law the pope has full dispensing power. Every such dispensation granted by him is valid, and when he acts from a sufficient motive it is also licit.

He is not, however, out of consideration for the public welfare, to exercise this power personally, unless in very exceptional cases, where certain specific impediments are in question. Such cases are error, violence, Holy orders, disparity of worship, public [[conjugicide]], [[consanguinity]] in the direct line or in the first degree (equal) of the collateral Line and the first degree of affinity (from lawful intercourse) in the direct line. As a rule the pope exercises his power of dispensation through the Roman Congregations and Tribunals.

Until around the 1900s, the [[Dataria]] was the most important channel for matrimonial dispensations when the impediment was public or about to become public within a short time. The [[Holy Office]], however, had exclusive control ''in foro externo'' over all impediments connected with or juridically bearing on matters of faith, e. g. disparity of worship, ''mixta religio'', Holy orders, etc. The dispensing power ''in foro interno'' lay with the [[Penitentiaria]], and in the case of pauperes or quasi-pauperes this same Congregation had dispensing power over public impediments in foro externo. The Penitentiaria held as pauperes for all countries outside of Italy those whose united capital, productive of a fixed revenue, did not exceed 5370 lire (about 1050 dollars); and as quasi-pauperes, those whose capital did not exceed 9396 lire (about 1850 dollars). It likewise had the power of promulgating general indults affecting public impediments, as for instance the indult of 15 November 1907. [[Propaganda Fide]] was charged with all dispensations, both in foro inferno and in foro externo, for countries under its jurisdiction, as was the Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs for all countries depending on it, e. g. Russia, Latin America and certain [[apostolic vicariate]]s and [[prefectures Apostolic]].

On 3 November 1908, the duties of these various Congregations received important modifications in consequence of the [[Apostolic Constitution]] "Sapienti", in which [[Pope Pius X]] reorganized the Roman Curia. Dispensing power from public impediments in the case of pauperes or quasi-pauperes was transferred from the Dataria and the Penitentiaria to a newly established [[Roman Congregation]] known as the [[Congregatio de Disciplinâ Sacramentorum]], the Penitentiaria retaining dispensing power over occult impediments in foro interno only. The Holy Office retained its faculties, but restricted expressly under three heads: (1) disparity of worship; (2) mixta religio; (3) the [[Pauline privilege]].

''[[Congregatio de Propaganda Fide]]'' remained the channel for securing dispensations for all countries under its jurisdiction, but being required for the sake of executive unity, to defer, in all matters concerning matrimony, to the various Congregations competent to act thereon, its function became that of intermediary. In America, the United States, Canada and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], and in Europe, the British Isles were withdrawn from Propaganda, and placed under the common law of countries with a hierarchy. The Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs lost all its powers; consequently the countries hitherto subject to it must address themselves either to the Holy Office or to the Congregatio de Disciplinâ Sacramentorum according to the nature of the impediment.

The powers of any Congregation are suspended during the vacancy of the [[Holy See]], except those of the [[Apostolic Penitentiary]] in the [[internal forum]] (''in foro interno''), which, during that time, are even increased. Though suspended, the powers of a Congregation may be used in cases of urgent necessity.

==== The diocesan bishops ====
We shall treat first of their fixed perpetual faculties, whether ordinary or delegated, afterwards of their habitual and temporary faculties. By virtue of their ordinary power (Jurisdiction) [[bishop]]s can dispense from those prohibent impediments of ecclesiastical law which are not reserved to the pope. The reserved impediments of this kind are espousals, the vow of perpetual [[chastity]], and vows taken in diocesan [[religious institute]]s, mixta religio, public display and solemn blessing at marriages within forbidden times, the [[vetitum]], or [[interdict]] laid on a marriage by the pope, or by the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] in a case of appeal. The bishop may also dispense from diriment impediments after the following manner: —

# By tacit consent of the Holy See he can dispense in foro interno from secret impediments from which the pope is wont to exercise his power of dispensing, in three cases: (a) in marriages already contracted and consummated, when urgent necessity arises (i. e. when the interested parties cannot be separated without scandal or endangering their souls, and there is no time to have recourse to the Holy See or to its delegate) — it is, however, necessary that such marriage shall have taken place in lawful form before the Church, and that one of the contracting parties at least shall have been ignorant of the impediment; (b) in marriages about to be contracted and which are called embarrassing (perplexi) cases, i. e. where everything being ready a delay would be defamatory or would cause scandal; (c) when there is a serious doubt of fact as to the existence of an impediment; in this case the dispensation seems to hold good, even though in course of time the impediment becomes certain, and even public. In cases where the law is doubtful no dispensation is necessary; but the bishop may, if he thinks proper, declare authentically the existence and sufficiency of such doubt.
# By virtue of a decree of the Congregation of the Inquisition or Holy Office (20 February 1888) diocesan bishops and other ordinaries (especially a [[Vicar Apostolic]], [[administrator Apostolic]] and [[Prefect Apostolic]], having jurisdiction over an allocated territory, also [[vicar-general]] ''in spiritualibus'' and a [[vicar capitular]]) may dispense in very urgent (''gravissimum'') danger of death from all diriment impediments (secret or public) of ecclesiastical law, except priesthood and affinity (from lawful intercourse) in the direct line. However, they can use this privilege only in favour of persons actually living in real concubinage or united by a merely civil marriage, and only when there is no time for recourse to the Holy See. They may also legitimize the children of such unions, except those born of adultery or sacrilege. In the decree of 1888 is also included the impediment of clandestinity. This decree permits therefore (at least until the Holy See shall have issued other instructions) to dispense, in the case of concubinage or civil marriage, with the presence of the priest and of the two witnesses required by the Decree "Ne temere" in urgent cases of marriage in extremis. Canonists do not agree as to whether bishops hold these faculties by virtue of their ordinary power or by general delegation of the law. It seems to us more probable that those just described under #1 belong to them as ordinaries, while those under #2 are delegated. They are, therefore, empowered to delegate the former; in order to subdelegate the latter they must be guided by the limits fixed by the decree of 1888 and its interpretation dated 9 June 1889. That is, if it is a question of habitual delegation parish priests only should receive it, and only for cases where there is no time for recourse to the bishop.

Besides the fixed perpetual faculties, bishops also receive from the Holy See habitual temporary indults for a certain period of time or for a limited number of cases. These faculties are granted by fixed "formulæ", in which the Holy See from time to time, or as occasion requires it, makes some slight modifications. These faculties call for a broad interpretation. Nevertheless, it is well to bear in mind, when interpreting them, the actual legislation of the Congregation whence they issue, so as not to extend their use beyond the places, persons, number of cases and impediments laid down in a given indult. Faculties thus delegated to a bishop do not in any way restrict his ordinary faculties; nor (in se) do the faculties issued by one Congregation affect those granted by another. When several specifically different impediments occur in the same case, and one of them exceeds the bishop's powers, he may not dispense from any of them.

Even when the bishop has faculties for each impediment taken separately he cannot (unless he possesses the faculty known as ''de cumulo'') use his various faculties simultaneously in a case where, all the impediments being public, one of them exceeds his ordinary faculties, it is not necessary for a bishop to delegate his faculties to his vicars-general; since 1897 they were always granted to the bishop as ordinary, therefore to the vicar-general also. With regard to other priests a decree of the holy Office (14 December 1898) declared that for the future temporary faculties may be always subdelegated unless the indult expressly states the contrary. These faculties are valid from the date when they were granted in the Roman Curia. In actual practice they do not expire, as a rule, at the death of the pope nor of the bishop to whom they were given, but pass on to those who take his place (the ''vicar capitular'', the administrator or succeeding bishop). Faculties granted for a fixed period of time, or a limited number of cases, cease when the period or number has been reached; but while awaiting their renewal the bishop, unless culpably negligent, may continue to use them provisionally. A bishop can use his habitual faculties only in favour of his own subjects. The matrimonial discipline of the Decree ''[[Ne temere]]'' (2 August 1907) contemplates as such all persons having a true canonical domicile, or continuously resident for one month within his territory, also vagi, or persons who have no domicile anywhere and can claim no continuous stay of one month. When a matrimonial impediment is common to both parties the bishop, in dispensing his own subject, dispenses also the other.

====Vicars capitular and vicars-general ====
A vicar capitular, or in his place a lawful administrator, enjoys all the dispensing powers possessed by the bishop in virtue of his ordinary jurisdiction or of delegation of the law; according to the actual discipline he enjoys even the habitual powers which had been granted the deceased bishop for a fixed period of time or for a limited number of cases, even if the indult should have been made out in the name of the Bishop of N. Considering the actual praxis of the Holy See, the same is true of particular indults (see below). The vicar-general has by virtue of his appointment all the ordinary powers of the bishop over prohibent impediments, but requires a special mandate to give him common-law faculties for diriment impediments. As for habitual temporary faculties, since they are now addressed to the ordinary, they belong also ipso facto to the vicar-general while he holds that office. He can also use particular indults when they are addressed to the ordinary, and when they are not so addressed the bishop can always subdelegate him, unless the contrary be expressly stated in the indult.

==== Parish priests and other ecclesiastics ====
A parish priest by common law can dispense only from an interdict laid on a marriage by him or by his predecessor. Some canonists of note accord him authority to dispense from secret impediments in what are called embarrassing (''perplexi'') cases, i. e. when there is no time for recourse to the bishop, but with the obligation of subsequent recourse ad cautelam, i. e. for greater security; a similar authority is attributed by them to confessors. This opinion seems yet gravely probable, though the Penitentiaria continues to grant among its habitual faculties a special authority for such cases and restricts somewhat its use.

===Particular indults of dispensation ===
When there is occasion to procure a dispensation that exceeds the powers of the ordinary, or when there are special reasons for direct recourse to the Holy See, procedure is by way of ''supplica'' (petition) and private [[rescript]]. The supplica need not necessarily be drawn up by the petitioner, nor even at his instance; it does not, however, become valid until he accepts it. Although, since the Constitution "Sapienti", all the faithful may have direct recourse to the Roman Congregations, the supplica is usually forwarded through the ordinary (of the person's birthplace or domicile, or since the Decree "Ne temere" the residence of one of the petitioners), who transmits it to the proper Congregation either by letter or through his accredited agent; but if there is question of sacramental secrecy, it is sent directly to the Penitentiaria, or handed to the bishop's agent under a sealed cover for transmission to the Penitentiaria. The supplica ought to give the names (family and Christian) of the petitioners (except in secret cases forwarded to the Penitentiaria), the name of the Ordinary forwarding it, or the name of the priest to whom, in secret cases, the rescript must be sent; the age of the parties, especially in dispensations affecting consanguinity and affinity; their religion, at 1east when one of them is not a Catholic; the nature, degree and number of all impediments (if recourse is had to the Congregatio de Disciplinâ Sacramentorum or to the Holy Office in a public impediment, and to the Penitentiaria at the same time in a secret one, it is necessary that the latter should know of the public impediment and that recourse has been had to the competent Congregation). The supplica must also contain the causes set forth for granting the dispensation and other circumstances specified in the Propaganda Fide Instruction of 9 May 1877 (it is no longer necessary, either for the validity or liceity of the dispensation, to observe the paragraph relating to incestuous intercourse, even when probably this very thing had been alleged as the only reason for granting the dispensation). When there is question of consanguinity in the second degree bordering on the first, the supplica ought to be written by the bishop's own hand. He ought also to sign the declaration of poverty made by the petitioners when the dispensation is sought from the Penitentiaria ''in formâ pauperum''; when he is in any way hindered from so doing he is bound to commission a priest to sign it in his name. A false declaration of poverty henceforth does not invalidate a dispensation in any case; but the authors of the false statement are bound in conscience to reimburse any amount unduly withheld (regulation for the Roman Curia of 12 June 1908). For further information on the many points already briefly described see the special canonical works, wherein are found all necessary directions as to what must be expressed so as to avoid nullity. When a supplica is affected (in a material point) by [[obreption]] or [[subreption]] it becomes necessary to ask for a so-called "reformatory decree" in case the favour asked has not yet been granted by the Curia, or for the letters known as "Perinde ac valere" if the favour has already been granted. If after all this a further material error is discovered, letters known as "Perinde ac valere super perinde ac valere" must be applied for.&lt;ref&gt;See Gasparri, "Tractatus de matrimonio" (2nd ed., Rome, 1892), I, no. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispensation rescripts are generally drawn up ''in formâ commissâ mixtâ'', i. e. they are entrusted to an executor who is thereby obliged to proceed to their execution, if he finds that the reasons are as alleged (''si vera sint exposita''). Canonists are divided as to whether rescripts in formâ commissâ mixtâ contain a favour granted from the moment of their being sent off, or to be granted when the execution actually takes place. Gasparri holds it as received practice that it suffices if the reasons alleged be actually true at the moment when the petition is presented. It is certain, however, that the executor required by Penitentiaria rescripts may safely fulfil his mission even if the pope should die before he had begun to execute it. The executor named for public impediments is usually the ordinary who forwards the supplica and for secret impediments an approved confessor chosen by the petitioner. Except when specially authorized, the person delegated cannot validly execute a dispensation before he has seen the original of the rescript. Therein it is usually prescribed that the reasons given by the petitioners must be verified. This verification, usually no longer a condition for valid execution, can be made, in the case of public impediments, extrajudicially or by subdelegation. In foro interno it can be made by the confessor in the very act of hearing the confessions of the parties. Should the inquiry disclose no substantial error, the executor proclaims the dispensation, i. e. he makes known, usually in writing, especially if he acts in foro externo, the decree which dispenses the petitioners; if the rescript authorizes him, he also legitimizes the children. Although the executor may subdelegate the preparatory acts, he may not, unless the rescript expressly says so, subdelegate the actual execution of the decree, unless he subdelegates to another ordinary. When the impediment is common to, and known to, both parties, execution ought to be made for both; wherefore, in a case in foro interno, the confessor of one of the parties hands over the rescript, after he has executed it, to the confessor of the other. The executor ought to observe with care the clauses enumerated in the decree, as some of them constitute conditions sine quâ non for the validity of the dispensation. As a rule, these clauses affecting validity may be recognized by the conditional conjunction or adverb of exclusion with which they begin (e. g. dummodo, "provided that"; et non aliter, "not otherwise"), or by an ablative absolute. When, however, a clause only prescribes a thing already of obligation by law it has merely the force of a reminder. In this matter also it is well to pay attention to the stylus curiœ, i. e. the legal diction of the Roman Congregations and Tribunals, and to consult authors of repute.

=== Causes for granting dispensations ===
Following the principles laid down for dispensations in general, a matrimonial dispensation granted without sufficient cause, even by the pope himself, would be illicit; the more difficult and numerous the impediments the more serious must be the motives for removing them. An unjustified dispensation, even if granted by the pope, is null and void, in a case affecting the Divine law; and if granted by other bishops or superiors in cases affecting ordinary ecclesiastical law. Moreover, as it is not supposable that the pope wishes to act illicitly, it follows that if he has been moved by false allegations to grant a dispensation, even in a matter of ordinary ecclesiastical law, such dispensation is invalid. Hence the necessity of distinguishing in dispensations between motive or determining causes (''causœ motivœ'') and impulsive or merely influencing causes (''causœ impulsivœ''). Except when the information given is false, still more when he acts spontaneously (''motu proprio'') and "with certain knowledge", the presumption always is that a superior is acting from just motives. It may be remarked that if the pope refuses to grant a dispensation on a certain ground, an inferior prelate, properly authorized to dispense, may grant the dispensation in the same case on other grounds which in his judgment are sufficient. Canonists do not agree as to whether he can grant it on the identical ground by reason of his divergent appreciation of the latter's force.

Among the sufficient causes for matrimonial dispensations we may distinguish canonical causes, i. e. classified and held as sufficient by the common law and canonical jurisprudence, and reasonable causes, i. e. not provided for nominally in the law, but deserving of equitable consideration in view of circumstances or particular cases. An Instruction issued by Propaganda Fide (9 May 1877) enumerated sixteen canonical causes. The "Formulary of the Dataria" (Rome, 1901) gave twenty-eight, which suffice, either alone or concurrently with others, and act as a norm for all sufficient causes; they are: smallness of place or places; smallness of place coupled with the fact that outside it a sufficient dowry cannot be had; lack of [[dowry]]; insufficiency of dowry for the bride; a larger dowry; an increase of dowry by one-third; cessation of [[family feud]]s; preservation of [[peace]]; conclusion of peace between princes or states; avoidance of lawsuits over an inheritance, a dowry or some important business transaction; the fact that a fiancée is an orphan or has the care of a family; the age of the fiancée over twenty-four; the difficulty of finding another partner, owing to the fewness of male acquaintance, or the difficulty the latter experience in coming to her home; the hope of safeguarding the faith of a Catholic relation; the danger of a denominationally mixed marriage; the hope of converting a non-Catholic party; the keeping of property in a family; the preservation of an illustrious or honourable family; the excellence and merits of the parties; defamation to be avoided, or scandal prevented; [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] already having taken place between the petitioners, or [[rape]]; the danger of a civil marriage; of marriage before a Protestant minister revalidation of a marriage that was null and void; finally, all reasonable causes judged such in the opinion of the pope (e. g. the public good), or special reasonable causes actuating the petitioners and made known to the pope, i. e. motives which, owing to the social status of the petitioners, it is opportune should remain unexplained out of respect for their reputation. These various causes have been stated in their briefest terms. To reach their exact force, some acquaintance is necessary with the ''stylus curiœ'' and the pertinent works of reputable authors, always avoiding exaggerated formalism. This list of causes is by no means exhaustive; the Holy See, in granting a dispensation, will consider any weighty circumstances that render the dispensation really justifiable.

===Costs of dispensations ===
The [[Council of Trent]] (Sess. XXIV, cap. v, De ref. matrim.) decreed that dispensations should be free of all charges. Diocesan chanceries are bound to conform to this law (many pontifical documents, and at times clauses in indults, remind them of it) and neither to exact nor accept anything but the modest contribution to the chancery expenses sanctioned by an Instruction approved by [[Innocent XI]] on 8 October 1678, and known as the Innocentian Tax (''[[Taxa Innocentiana]]''). Rosset holds that it is also lawful, when the diocese is poor, to demand payment of the expenses it incurs for dispensations. Sometimes the Holy See grants ampler freedom in this matter, but nearly always with the monition that all revenues from this source shall be employed for some good work, and not go to the diocesan curia as such. Henceforth every rescript requiring execution will state the sum which the diocesan curia is authorized to collect for its execution.

In the Roman Curia the expenses incurred by petitioners fall under four heads:
# expenses (''expensœ'') of carriage (postage, etc.), also a fee to the accredited agent, when one has been employed. This fee is fixed by the Congregation in question;
# a tax (''taxa'') to be used in defraying the expenses incurred by the Holy See in the organized administration of dispensations;
# the ''componendum'', or [[Charity (practice)|eleemosynary]] (alms) fine to be paid to the Congregation and applied by it to pious uses;
# an alms imposed on the petitioners and to be distributed by themselves in good works.

The moneys paid under the first two heads do not affect, strictly speaking, the gratuity of the dispensation. They constitute a just compensation for the expenses the petitioners occasion the Curia. As for the alms and the componendum, besides the fact that they do not profit the pope nor the members of the Curia personally, but are employed in pious uses, they are justifiable, either as a fine for the faults which, as a rule, give occasion for the dispensation, or as a check to restrain a too great frequency of petitions often based on frivolous grounds. And if the Tridentine prohibition be still urged, it may be truly said that the pope has the right to abrogate the decrees of councils, and is the best judge of the reasons that legitimize such abrogation. The custom of tax and componendum is neither uniform nor universal in the Roman Curia.

==Secular law equivalent==
Dispensation is the canonical equivalent of ''license''&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Edition; pg. 423&lt;/ref&gt; which, according to [[Black's Law Dictionary]], is the authorisation to do something which would normally be illegal if the competent authority had not granted permission.&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Edition; pg. 829&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology |methods}}

In [[anthropology]], [[folkloristics]], and the [[social sciences|social]] and [[behavioral sciences]], '''emic''' and '''etic''' refer to two kinds of [[field research]] done and viewpoints obtained:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.sil.org/~headlandt/ee-intro.htm |title=EE intro |publisher=SIL}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''emic,'' from within the [[social group]] (from the perspective of the subject) and ''etic,'' from outside (from the perspective of the observer).

==Definitions==
"The emic approach investigates how local people think" (Kottak, 2006): How they perceive and categorize the world, their rules for behavior, what has meaning for them, and how they imagine and explain things. "The etic (scientist-oriented) approach shifts the focus from local observations, categories, explanations, and interpretations to those of the anthropologist.  The etic approach realizes that members of a culture often are too involved in what they are doing..... to interpret their cultures impartially. When using the etic approach, the [[ethnographer]] emphasizes what he or she considers important."&lt;ref&gt;Kottak, Conrad (2006). ''Mirror for Humanity'', p. 47. McGraw-Hill, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-07-803490-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although emics and etics are sometimes regarded as inherently in conflict and one can be preferred to the exclusion of the other, the complementarity of emic and etic approaches to anthropological research has been widely recognized, especially in the areas of interest concerning the characteristics of human nature as well as the form and function of human social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Jingfeng, Xia (2013). ''An Anthropological Emic-Etic Perspective On Open Access Practices'' Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote | …Emic knowledge and interpretations are those existing within a culture, that are ‘determined by local custom, meaning, and belief’ (Ager and Loughry, 2004: n.p.) and best described by a 'native' of the culture. Etic knowledge refers to generalizations about human behavior that are considered universally true, and commonly links cultural practices to factors of interest to the researcher, such as economic or ecological conditions, that cultural insiders may not consider very relevant (Morris et al., 1999).}}
Emic and etic approaches of understanding behavior and personality fall under the study of cultural anthropology. [[Cultural anthropology]] states that people are shaped by their cultures and their subcultures, and we must account for this in the study of personality.  One way is looking at things through an emic approach. This approach "is culture specific because it focuses on a single culture and it is understood on its own terms."  As explained below, the term "emic" originated from the specific linguistic term "phonemic", from ''[[phoneme]]'', which is a language-specific way of abstracting [[speech sound]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Friedman | first1 = Howard S | first2 = Miriam W | last2 = Schustack | title = Personality: Classic Theories and Modern Research | place = Boston | publisher = Pearson Allyn &amp; Bacon | year = 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://psychology.geckos.sis.org.cn/2011/10/using-one-or-more-examples-explain-emic-and-etic-concepts-akane/ |title=Using one or more examples explain emic &amp; etic concepts |last=Akane |publisher=SIS |place=[[China|CN]] |date=October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121203103812/http://psychology.geckos.sis.org.cn/2011/10/using-one-or-more-examples-explain-emic-and-etic-concepts-akane/ |archivedate=2012-12-03 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*An 'emic' account is a description of behavior or a belief in terms meaningful (consciously or unconsciously) to the actor; that is, an emic account comes from a person within the culture.  Almost anything from within a culture can provide an emic account.
*An 'etic' account is a description of a [[behavior]] or belief by a social analyst or scientific observer (a student or scholar of anthropology or sociology, for example), in terms that can be applied across cultures; that is, an etic account attempts to be 'culturally neutral', limiting any ethnocentric, political, and/or cultural bias or alienation by the observer.
When these two approaches are combined, the “richest” view of a culture or society can be understood. On its own, an emic approach would struggle with applying overarching values to a single culture. The etic approach is helpful in enabling researchers to see more than one aspect of one culture, and in applying observations to cultures around the world.

==History==
The terms were coined in 1954 by linguist [[Kenneth Pike]], who argued that the tools developed for describing [[linguistics|linguistic]] behaviors could be adapted to the description of any human social behavior. As Pike noted, social scientists have long debated whether their knowledge is objective or subjective.  Pike's innovation was to turn away from an [[epistemological]] debate, and turn instead to a methodological solution. ''Emic'' and ''etic'' are derived from the [[Linguistics|linguistic]] terms [[phoneme|phonemic]] and [[phonetic]] respectively, which are in turn derived from Greek roots.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, H.G. &amp; Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones. with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of a truly objective description was discounted by Pike himself in his original work; he proposed the emic/etic dichotomy in anthropology as a way around philosophic issues about the very nature of [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The terms were also championed by [[anthropology|anthropologists]] [[Ward Goodenough]] and [[Marvin Harris]] with slightly different connotations from those used by Pike. Goodenough was primarily interested in understanding the culturally specific meaning of specific beliefs and practices; Harris was primarily interested in explaining human behavior.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Pike, Harris, and others have argued that cultural "insiders" and "outsiders" are equally capable of producing emic ''and'' etic accounts of their culture. Some researchers use "etic" to refer to objective or outsider accounts, and "emic" to refer to subjective or insider accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/~headlandt/ee-intro.htm|title=Thomas N. Headland: Controversies: Etic-Emic Introduction|website=Sil.org|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Mead]] was an anthropologist who studied the patterns of adolescence in Samoa. She discovered that the difficulties and the transitions that adolescents faced are culturally influenced. The hormones that are released during puberty can be defined using an etic framework, because [[adolescents]] globally have the same [[hormones]] being secreted. However, Mead concluded that how adolescents respond to these hormones is greatly influenced by their cultural norms. Through her studies, Mead found that simple classifications about behaviors and [[personality]] could not be used because peoples’ cultures influenced their behaviors in such a radical way.  Her studies helped create an emic approach of understanding behaviors and personality. Her research deduced that culture has a significant impact in shaping an individual’s personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/mead/field-sepik.html|title=Papua New Guinea: Sex and Temperament - Margaret Mead: Human Nature and the Power of Culture - Exhibitions - Library of Congress|work=loc.gov|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]], a Swiss [[psychoanalyst]], is a researcher who took an etic approach in his studies. Jung studied [[mythology]], [[religion]], ancient rituals, and [[dreams]] leading him to believe that there are [[archetypes]] that can be identified and used to categorize people’s behaviors. Archetypes are universal structures of the collective unconscious that refer to the inherent way people are predisposed to perceive and process information.  The main archetypes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/personalitydevelopment/tp/archetypes.htm|title=What Are Jung's 4 Major Archetypes?|author=Kendra Cherry|work=About.com Education|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Jung studied were the [[persona]] (how people choose to present themselves to the world), the [[anima and animus|animus]]/ anima (part of people experiencing the world in viewing the opposite sex, that guides how they select their romantic partner), and the [[shadow]] (dark side of personalities because people have a concept of evil. Well-adjusted people must integrate both good and bad parts of themselves). Jung looked at the role of the [[mother]] and deduced that all people have mothers and see their mothers in a similar way; they offer nurture and comfort. His studies also suggest that “infants have evolved to suck milk from the breast, it is also the case that all children have inborn tendencies to react in certain ways.” This way of looking at the mother is an etic way of applying a concept cross-culturally and universally.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Importance as regards personality==
Emic and etic approaches are important to understanding personality because problems can arise “when concepts, measures, and methods are carelessly transferred to other cultures in attempts to make cross- cultural generalizations about personality.” It is hard to apply certain generalizations of behavior to people who are so diverse and culturally different. One example of this is the F-scale (Macleod).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/authoritarian-personality.html|title=Theories of Personality|work=simplypsychology.org|accessdate=21 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024113220/http://www.simplypsychology.org/authoritarian-personality.html|archivedate=24 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]], which was created by [[Theodor Adorno]], is used to measure [[Authoritarian Personality]], which can, in turn, be used to predict prejudiced behaviors. This test, when applied to Americans accurately depicts [[prejudices]] towards black individuals. However, when a study was conducted in [[South Africa]] using the F-Scale, (Pettigrew and Friedman) &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; results did not predict any anti-Black prejudices. This study used emic approaches of study by conducting interviews with the locals and etic approaches by giving participants generalized personality tests.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="962">An '''extension agency''' is an organisation that practises [[Extension (semantics)|extension]], in the context of [[community development]]. An example is the ''[[Cooperative Extension Service]]'', which aims to assist individuals or groups in defining and achieving their goals in rural communities in the USA.
 
'''Extension agents''' are trained in the skills of extension, such as communication and group facilitation, and usually in technical areas of the sector they serve (for example agriculture, health, or safety). [[Agricultural extension]] agencies promote more profitable and sustainable farming, while '''health extension''' agencies promote improved health. 

Extension agents are represented by '''professional organisations''' such as the [http://www.apen.org.au/ Australasia-Pacific Extension Network] and publish in journals such as the [http://www.joe.org/ Journal of Extension].

'''''Far-fetched facts''''' is a book by German [[anthropologist]] [[Richard Rottenburg]] published in German as ''Weit hergeholte Fakten'' in 2002; the English translation was released in 2009. The book is an [[ethnography|ethnography-based]], though fictionalized, [[polyphonic]] account of a waterworks improvement project in Tanzania (called Ruritania in the books fictionalization). The book follows the different stages of the development project by looking closely at the interactions between a Northern development bank, experts of an international consulting firm and African project managers. It focuses thereby on technologies of inscription that enable the reconnaissance and [[operationalization]] of improvement measures to be taken, but also guide the overall interaction between the different stakeholders of the project. Showing these representational and managerial practices the book lays bare the necessary day-to-day production of objectivity and legitimacy in development projects, but also the intricacies and inconsistencies of daily translation processes, that often lead to the rather disappointing results of such development enterprises. Inspired by [[Organizational studies|organizational]] and [[science and technology studies]] “Far-fetched facts” provides an anthropological critique of the aid industry in Africa distinct from [[Postdevelopment theory|postdevelopment critique]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11256">'''Gene–environment correlation''' (or '''genotype–environment correlation''') is said to occur when exposure to environmental conditions depends on an individual's [[genotype]].

==Definition==
Gene–environment correlations (or rGE) is [[correlation]] of two [[Phenotypic trait|trait]]s, e.g. height and weight, which would mean that when one changes, so does the other. Gene–environment correlations can arise by both [[Causality|causal and non-causal]] mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Jaffee2007"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[:d:Q56061124|Jaffee SR]], [[:d:Q40284708|Price TS]]|journal= Molecular Psychiatry |title= Gene–environment correlations: a review of the evidence and implications for prevention of mental illness |year= 2007 |volume= 12 |issue= 5 |pages= 432–442 |pmid= 17453060 |doi= 10.1038/sj.mp.4001950 |pmc= 3703541 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of principal interest are those causal mechanisms which indicate genetic control over environmental exposure. Genetic variants influence environmental exposure indirectly via behavior. Three causal mechanisms giving rise to gene–environment correlations have been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Plomin R, DeFries JC, Loehlin JC |journal= Psychological Bulletin |volume= 84 |issue= 2 |pages= 309–322 |year= 1977 |title= Genotype–environment interaction and correlation in the analysis of human behavior |pmid = 557211 |doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.84.2.309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: (i) '''Passive''' gene–environment correlation refers to the association between the genotype a child inherits from his or her parents and the environment in which the child is raised. Parents create a home environment that is influenced by their own [[heritability|heritable]] characteristics. Biological parents also pass on genetic material to their children. When the children's genotype also influences their behavioral or cognitive outcomes, the result can be a [[spurious relationship]] between environment and outcome. For example, because parents who have histories of antisocial behavior (which is moderately [[heritability|heritable]]) are at elevated risk of abusing their children, a case can be made for saying that maltreatment may be a marker for genetic risk that parents transmit to children rather than a causal risk factor for children’s conduct problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DiLalla LF, Gottesman II|journal= Psychological Bulletin |volume= 109 |issue= 1 |pages= 125–129 |year= 1991 |title= Biological and genetic contributions to violence: Widom’s untold tale |pmid = 2006224 |doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.109.1.125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: (ii) '''Evocative''' (or reactive) gene–environment correlation happens when an individual's (heritable) behavior evokes an environmental response. For example, the association between marital conflict and depression may reflect the tensions that arise when engaging with a depressed spouse rather than a causal effect of marital conflict on risk for depression.

: (iii) '''Active''' gene–environment correlation occurs when an individual possesses a heritable inclination to select environmental exposure. For example, individuals who are characteristically extroverted may seek out very different social environments than those who are shy and withdrawn.

Gene–environment correlation can also arise from non-causal mechanisms, including evolutionary processes and behavioral 'contamination' of the environmental measure. Evolutionary processes, such as [[genetic drift]] and [[natural selection]], can cause allele frequencies to differ between populations. For example, exposure to malaria-bearing mosquitoes over many generations may have caused the higher allele frequency among certain ethnic groups for the sickle [[hemoglobin]] (HbS) allele, a [[recessive]] mutation that causes [[sickle-cell disease]] but confers resistance against [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aidoo M, Terlouw DJ, Kolczak MS, McElroy PD, ter Kuile FO, Kariuki S, Nahlen BL, Lal AA, Udhayakumar V |journal= Lancet |volume= 359 |issue= 9314 |pages= 1311–1312 |year= 2002 |title= Protective effects of the sickle cell gene against malaria morbidity and mortality |pmid = 11965279 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08273-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, HbS genotype has become associated with the malarial environment.

==Evidence==

=== Quantitative genetic studies ===
[[Twin studies|Twin and adoption studies]] have provided much of the evidence for gene–environment correlations by demonstrating that putative environmental measures are [[heritability|heritable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kendler KS, Baker JH|journal= Psychological Medicine |volume= 37 |issue= 5  |pages= 615–626 |year= 2007 |title= Genetic influences on measures of the environment: a systematic review |pmid = 17176502 |doi= 10.1017/S0033291706009524}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, studies of adult twins have shown that desirable and undesirable life events are moderately heritable as are specific life events and life circumstances, including divorce, the propensity to marry, marital quality and social support. Studies in which researchers have measured child-specific aspects of the environment have also shown that putative environmental factors, such as parental discipline or warmth, are moderately heritable. Television viewing, peer group orientations and social attitudes have all been shown to be moderately heritable. There is also a growing literature on the genetic factors influencing behaviors that constitute a risk to health, such as the consumption of alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs, and risk-taking behaviors. Like parental discipline, these health related behaviors are genetically influenced, but are thought to have environmentally mediated effects on disease. To the extent that researchers have attempted to determine why genes and environments are correlated, most evidence has pointed to the intervening effects of personality and behavioral characteristics.

Environments are heritable because genotype influences the behaviours that evoke, select, and modify features of the environment. Thus, environments less amenable to behavioural modification tend to be less heritable.&lt;ref name="Jaffee2007"/&gt; For example, negative life events that are beyond the control of the individual (e.g., the death of a loved one, losing one’s home in a natural disaster) have lower heritability than negative life events that may be dependent on an individual’s behaviour (e.g., getting a divorce, getting fired from a job). Similarly, personal life events (i.e., events that occur directly to an individual) are more highly heritable than network life events (i.e., events that occur to someone within an individual’s social network, thus affecting the individual indirectly).

=== Molecular genetic studies ===
Evidence for the existence of gene–environment correlations has recently started to accrue from [[Molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] investigations. The [[Collaborative Studies on Genetics of Alcoholism]] (COGA) group has reported that a single-nucleotide polymorphism in intron 7 of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A a2 receptor (rs279871; GABRA2) was associated with [[alcohol dependence]] and marital status. Individuals who had the high-risk GABRA2 variant (i.e., the variant associated with alcohol dependence) were less likely to be married, in part because they were at higher risk for [[antisocial personality disorder]] and were less likely to be motivated by a desire to please others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dick DM, Agrawal A, Schuckit MA, Bierut L, Hinrichs A, Fox L, Mullaney J, Cloninger CR, Hesselbrock V, ((Nurnberger JI Jr)), Almasy L, Foroud T, Porjesz B, Edenberg H, Begleiter H |journal= J Stud Alcohol |volume= 67 |issue= 2 |pages= 185–194 |year= 2006 |title= Marital status, alcohol dependence, and GABRA2: evidence for gene–environment correlation and interaction |pmid= 16562401 |doi=10.15288/jsa.2006.67.185}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also molecular evidence for passive gene–environment correlation. A recent study found that children were almost 2.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) if their mothers were divorced, separated, or never married. In this sample, however, mothers possessing the short allele of the [[dopamine receptor]] gene DRD2 were more likely to be divorced, separated, or never married. Moreover, their children were more likely to have ADHD. Therefore, part of the association between parental marital status and ADHD diagnosis among children in this sample is due to the [[confounding variable]] of maternal DRD2 genotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Waldman ID |journal= Development and Psychopathology |volume= 19 |pages= 1117–1128 |year= 2007 |title= Gene–environment interactions reexamined: Does mother’s marital stability interact with the dopamine receptor D2 gene in the etiology of childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder? |doi = 10.1017/S0954579407000570 |pmid = 17931438 |issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these studies also found evidence for [[gene–environment interaction]].

== Significance ==
Doctors want to know whether exposure to environmental risk causes disease. The fact that environmental exposures are heritable means that the relationship between environmental exposure and disease may be [[confounding|confounded]] by genotype. That is, the relationship may be [[Spurious relationship|spurious]] (not causal), because the same genetic factors might be influencing both exposure to environmental risk and disease. In such cases, measures aimed at reducing environmental exposure will not reduce the risk for disease. On the other hand, heritability of exposure to environmental conditions itself does not mean environmental factors are not responsible for disease and so exposure reduction would benefit individuals with genetic predisposition to risk behavior.

For example, a study of children born to twin sisters investigated whether the relationship between parental divorce and offspring alcohol and [[emotion]]al problems was causal or confounded by parental genotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=D'Onofrio BM, Turkheimer E, Emery RE, Maes HH, Silberg J, Eaves LJ | title= A children of twins study of parental divorce and offspring psychopathology | journal= Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | year= 2007 | volume= 48 | pages= 667–675 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01741.x | pmc= 2990346 | pmid= 17593147 | issue= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that the offspring of twin sisters who were discordant for divorce had equally high levels of emotional problems, suggesting that genetic factors which made twin siblings divorce-prone also increased their children’s risk for depression and anxiety. This finding suggests that preventing the parents’ divorce would have had little impact on offspring risk for emotional problems (although the findings for alcohol problems in the children were consistent with a causal role for divorce).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1957">A '''hydrogen turboexpander-generator''' or '''generator loaded expander for hydrogen gas''' is an axial flow [[turbine]] or [[Turboexpander|radial expander]] for [[energy recovery]] through which a high [[pressure]] [[hydrogen gas]] is expanded to produce work that is used to drive an [[electrical generator]]. It replaces the [[control valve]] or regulator where the pressure drops to the appropriate pressure for the low pressure network.

==Description==
Per stage 200 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] is handled with up to 15,000 [[kW]] power and a maximum [[expansion ratio]] of 14, the generator loaded expander for hydrogen gas is fitted with automatic [[thrust balance]], a [[dry gas seal]] and a [[programmable logic control]] with remote monitoring and diagnostics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geoilandgas.com/businesses/ge_oilandgas/en/literature/en/downloads/turbo_generators.pdf Turbo generators]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
The hydrogen turboexpander-generators are used for [[hydrogen pipeline transport]] in combination with [[hydrogen compressor]]s and for the recovery of energy in [[underground hydrogen storage]]. A variation are the compressor loaded [[turboexpander]]s which are used in the [[liquefaction of gases]] such as [[liquid hydrogen]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/pdfs/merit_review_2009/advanced_combustion/ace_16_wagner.pdf Achieving and demonstrating vehicle technologies engine fuel efficiency milestones-Pag.18]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5100">{{Redirect|HWV}}
The '''Händel-Werke-Verzeichnis''' (abbreviated as '''HWV''') is the '''Catalogue of Handel's Works'''. It was published in three volumes (in German) by [[Bernd Baselt]] between 1978 and 1986, and lists every piece of music known to have been written by [[George Frideric Handel]]. The catalogue also includes the first few bars of each piece and large amounts of factual information including manuscript sources, early prints, photographs, spurious works, etc. The catalogue does not include the full scores of Handel's works (for the full scores, see [[Händel-Gesellschaft]] and [[Hallische Händel-Ausgabe]]).

==Numbering==
The HWV thematic catalogue serves as the modern numbering system for Handel's compositions. For example, Handel's ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' is numbered as HWV 56.&lt;ref&gt;{{NewGrove2001|article=Handel, George Frideric|last=Hicks|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony Hicks|vol=x|pages=785}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HWV numbers range from 1 to 612, however they do not represent a global date-ordering of composition; i.e. HWV 1 is not Handel's first work, nor is HWV 612 his last. Instead, the HWV numbers group works into musical categories, and provide a good ordering of the date of composition within each category. The following table lists the categories and the HWV number ranges.

|}

There are gaps and anomalies in the HWV numbering system, so the above table is only useful as a guide (see the [[List of compositions by George Frideric Handel]] for more details).

The HWV numbers do not imply that Handel wrote exactly 612 works. The combination of unnumbered works, lost works, misattributed works, spurious works, variants (e.g. HWV 251 a–d), grouped works (e.g. HWV 229 1–7), and arrangements (e.g. HWV 482 1–4), all render meaningless the determination of the exact number of Handel's compositions.

The '''Indian Council of Social Science Research''' ('''ICSSR''') is the national body overseeing research in the [[social sciences]] in India. It was established in [[New Delhi]] in 1969.{{r|epw|page=3606}} It provides funding to scholars and to a network of twenty-seven [[research institutes]],{{r|epw|page=3606}} among them:

* the [[Centre for Development Studies]], Thiruvananthapuram
* the [[Centre for Policy Research]], New Delhi
* the [[Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta]]
* the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]], Delhi
* the Centre for Multi-Disciplinary Development Research
* the [[Centre for Women's Development Studies]], Delhi
* the [[Govind Ballabh Pant Social Science Institute]], Allahabad
* the Indian Institute Of Economics, Hyderabad
* the [[Institute of Public Enterprise]], Hyderabad
* the [[Institute for Social and Economic Change]], Bangalore
* the [[Institute for Studies in Industrial Development]], New Delhi
* the [[Madras Institute of Development Studies]].

A large proportion of its budget is spent on its own administration; in 1996–1997, this amounted to 23% of total expenditure.{{r|epw|page=3607}} It has been described as an "oversized, unimaginative and inefficient bureaucrac[y]".{{r|epw|page=3604}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15268">The '''Knowledge Based Software Assistant (KBSA)''' was a research program funded by the [[United States Air Force]]. The goal of the program was to apply concepts from [[artificial intelligence]] to the problem of designing and implementing [[computer software]]. Software would be described by models in very high level languages (essentially equivalent to [[First Order Logic|first order logic]]) and then [[rule of inference|transformation rules]] would transform the specification into efficient code. The air force hoped to be able to generate the software to control [[Weapon systems|weapons systems]] and other [[command and control]] systems using this method. As software was becoming ever more critical to USAF weapons systems it was realized that improving the quality and productivity of the software development process could have significant benefits for the military, as well as for [[Information Technology|information technology]] in other major US industries.

In the early 1980s the United States Air Force realized that they had received significant benefits from applying artificial intelligence technologies to solving expert problems such as the diagnosis of faults in aircraft. The air force commissioned a group of researchers from the [[artificial intelligence]] and [[formal methods]] communities to develop a report on how such technologies might be used to aid in the more general problem of software development.

The report described a vision for a new approach to software development. Rather than define specifications with diagrams and manually transform them to code as was the current process, the KBSA vision was to define specifications in very high level languages and then to use transformation rules to gradually refine the specification into efficient code on heterogeneous platforms.

Each step in the design and refinement of the system would be recorded as part of an integrated repository. In addition to the artifacts of software development the processes, the various definitions and transformations, would also be recorded in a way that they could be analyzed and also replayed later as needed. The idea was that each step would be a transformation that took into account various non-functional requirements for the implemented system. For example, requirements to use specific programming languages such as Ada or to harden code for real time mission critical fault tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=Cordell |author2=D. Luckham |author3=R. Balzer |author4=T. Cheatham |author5=C. Rich|title=Report on a Knowledge-Based Software Assistant|journal=Kestrel Institute|date=Aug 1983|volume=A996431|pages=78|url=ftp://ftp.kestrel.edu/pub/papers/green/KBSA.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The air force decided to fund further research on this vision through their [[Rome Air Development Center]] laboratory at [[Griffiss Air Force Base|Griffiss air force base]] in New York. The majority of the early research was conducted at the Kestrel Institute in Northern California (with [[Stanford University]]) and the [[Information Sciences Institute]] (ISI) in Southern California (with [[University of Southern California|USC]] and [[UCLA]]). The Kestrel Institute focused primarily on the provably correct transformation of logical models to efficient code. ISI focused primarily on the front end of the process on defining specifications that could map to logical formalisms but were in formats that were intuitive and familiar to systems analysts. In addition, Raytheon did a project to investigate informal requirements gathering and Honeywell and Harvard University did work on underlying frameworks, integration, and activity coordination.

Although not primarily funded by the KBSA program the [[MIT]] Programmer's Apprentice project also had many of the same goals and used the same techniques as KBSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rich|first=Charles|author2=Richard C. Waters |title=The Programmer's Apprentice Project: A Research Overview|journal=IEE Expert Special Issue on the Interactions between Expert Systems and Software Engineering|date=November 1987|url=ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-1004.pdf|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later stages of the KBSA program (starting in 1991) researchers developed prototypes that were used on medium to large scale software development problems. Also, in these later stages the emphasis shifted from  a pure KBSA approach to more general questions of how to use knowledge-based technology to supplement and augment existing and future [[Computer Aided Software Engineering|computer-aided software engineering]] (CASE) tools. In these later stages there was significant interaction between the KBSA community and the object-oriented and software engineering communities. For example, KBSA concepts and researchers played an important role in the mega-programming and user centered software engineering programs sponsored by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeBellis|first=Michael|author2=Christine Haapala |title=User-Centric Software Engineering|journal=IEEE Expert|date= February 1995|volume=10|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these later stages the program changed its name to Knowledge-Based Software Engineering (KBSE). The name change reflected the different research goal, no longer to create a totally new all encompassing tool that would cover the complete software life cycle but to gradually work knowledge-based technology into existing tools. Companies such as [[Andersen Consulting]] (one of the largest system integrators and at the time vendor of their own CASE tool) played a major role in the program in these later stages.

==Key concepts==

=== Transformation rules ===
The transformation rules that KBSA used were different than traditional rules for expert systems. Transformation rules matched against specification and implementation languages rather than against facts in the world. It was possible to specify transformations using patterns, wildcards, and recursion on both the right and left hand sides of a rule. The left hand expression would specify patterns in the existing knowledge base to search for. The right hand expression could specify a new pattern to transform the left hand side into. For example, transform a set theoretic data type into code using an Ada set library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Doug|title=Automating Software Design|year=1991|publisher=AAAI/MIT Press|isbn=978-0262620802|pages=483–514|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.54.6955&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=ps|editor=Michael Lowry, Robert McCartney|chapter=KIDS - A Knowledge-Based Software Development System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial purpose for transformation rules was to refine a high level logical specification into well designed code for a specific hardware and software platform. This was inspired by early work on theorem proving and automatic programming. However, researchers at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) developed the concept of ''evolution transformations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Lewis|author2=M.S. Feather |title=Using Evolution Transformations to Construct Specifications|journal=Automating Software Design|year=1991|pages=65–92|publisher=AAAI Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Rather than transforming a specification into  code an evolution transformation was meant to automate various stereotypical changes at the specification level, for example developing a new superclass by extracting various capabilities from an existing class that can be shared more generally. Evolution transformations were developed at approximately the same time as the emergence of the software patterns community and the two groups shared concepts and technology. Evolution transformations were essentially what is known as [[refactoring]] in the object-oriented software patterns community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Martin|title=Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code|year=1999|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=0201485672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Knowledge-based repository ===
A key concept of KBSA was that all artifacts: requirements, specifications, transformations, designs, code, process models, etc. were represented as objects in a [[Knowledge base|knowledge-based]] [[Repository (version control)|repository]]. The original KBSA report describes what was called a Wide Spectrum Language. The requirement was for a [[knowledge representation]] framework that could support the entire life cycle: requirements, specification, and code as well as the software process itself. The core representation for the knowledge base was meant to utilize the same framework although various layers could be added to support specific presentations and implementations.

These early knowledge-base frameworks were developed primarily by ISI and Kestrel building on top of Lisp and Lisp machine environments. The Kestrel environment was eventually turned into a commercial product called Refine which was developed and supported by a spin-off company from Kestrel called Reasoning Systems Incorporated.

The Refine language and environment also proved to be applicable to the problem of software reverse engineering: taking legacy code that is critical to the business but that lacks proper documentation and using tools to analyze it and transform it to a more maintainable form. With the growing concern of the [[Y2K problem]] reverse engineering was a major business concern for many large US corporations and it was a focus area for KBSA research in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boehm|first=Barry|author2=Prasanta Bose |title=KBSA Life Cycle Evaluation: Final Technical Report|journal=Contract No: F30602-96-C-0274|date=1998-08-15|volume=I|url=http://csse.usc.edu/csse/event/1999/ARR/volumeI.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2014|publisher=USC Center for Software Engineering|quote=As the program has proceeded toward its ultimate objectives, it has spawned a number of productivity-enhancing spinoffs such as the Refine-based software reengineering and testing tools}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Welty|first=Chris|title=Summary of KBSE-93: The Eighth Annual Knowledge-Based Software Engineering Conference|url=http://ase-conferences.org/ase/past/kbse-8.txt|work=ase-conferences.org|accessdate=4 January 2014|quote=REFINE/COBOL Object Modeling Workbench provides a set of reengineering tools, Refine is the language of the KBSA concept demo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was significant interaction between the KBSA communities and the [[Frame language]] and [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] communities. The early KBSA knowledge-bases were implemented in [[object-based]] languages rather than [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]]. Objects were represented as classes and sub-classes but it was not possible to define methods on the objects. In later versions of KBSA such as the Andersen Consulting Concept Demo the specification language was expanded to support message passing as well.

=== Intelligent Assistant ===
KBSA took a different approach than traditional expert systems when it came to how to solve problems and work with users. In the traditional expert system approach the user answers a series of interactive questions and the system provides a solution. The KBSA approach left the user in control. Where as an expert system tried to, to some extent replace and remove the need for the expert the intelligent assistant approach in KBSA sought to re-invent the process with technology. This led to a number of innovations at the user interface level.

An example of the collaboration between the object-oriented community and KBSA was the architecture used for KBSA user interfaces. KBSA systems utilized a model-view-controller (MVC) user interface. This was an idea incorporated from Smalltalk environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Dave|author2=A. Czuchry |title=The Knowledge-Based Requirements Assistant|journal=IEEE Expert|year=1988|volume=3|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MVC architecture was especially well suited to the KBSA user interface.  KBSA environments featured multiple heterogeneous views of the knowledge-base. It might be useful to look at an emerging model from the standpoint of entities and relations, object interactions, class hierarchies, dataflow, and many other possible views. The MVC architecture facilitated this. With the MVC architecture the underlying model was always the knowledge base which was a [[Metaobject|meta-model]] description of the specification and implementation languages. When an analyst made some change via a particular diagram (e.g. added a class to the class hierarchy) that change was made at the underlying model level and the various views of the model were all automatically updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Lewis|author2=David R. Harris |author3=Kevin M. Benner |author4=Martin S. Feather |title=Aries: The Requirements/Specification Facet for KBSA|journal=Rome Laboratory Final Technical Report|date=October 1992|volume=RL-TR-92-248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the benefits of using a transformation was that many aspects of the specification and implementation could be modified at once. For small scale prototypes the resulting diagrams were simple enough that basic layout algorithms combined with reliance on users to clean up diagrams was sufficient. However, when a transformation can radically redraw models with tens or even hundreds of nodes and links the constant updating of the various views becomes a task in itself. Researchers at Andersen Consulting incorporated work from the University of Illinois on graph theory to automatically update the various views associated with the knowledge base and to generate graphs that have minimal intersection of links and also take into account domain and user specific layout constraints.

Another concept used to provide intelligent assistance was automatic text generation. Early research at ISI investigated the feasibility of extracting formal specifications from informal natural language text documents. They determined that the approach was not viable. Natural language is by nature simply too ambiguous to serve as a good format for defining a system.  However, natural language generation was seen to be feasible as a way to generate textual descriptions that could be read by managers and non-technical personnel. This was especially appealing to the air force since by law they required all contractors to generate various reports that describe the system from different points of view. Researchers at ISI and later Cogentext and Andersen Consulting demonstrated the viability of the approach by using their own technology to generate the documentation required by their air force contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeBellis|first=Michael|author2=Kanth Miriyala |author3=Sudin Bhat |author4=William C.

{{Usul al-fiqh}}
In [[Islamic]] terminology, something which is '''''makruh''''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: مكروه, [[transliteration|transliterated]]: '''makrooh''' or ''makrūh'') is a disliked or offensive act (literally "detestable" or "abominable"&lt;ref name=aldin/&gt;). It is one of the [[Ahkam|five categories]] (''al-ahkam al-khamsa'') in Islamic law -- ''[[wajib]]/[[fard]]'' (obligatory), ''[[Mustahabb]]/mandub'' (recommended), ''[[mubah]]'' (neutral), ''makruh'' (disapproved), ''[[haram]]'' (forbidden).&lt;ref name=CampoEoI&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campo|first1=Juan Eduardo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|publisher=infobase|page=284|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;dq=Makruh+haram+halal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TEi8U_6ZGcqLyASr94KIDg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Makruh%20haram%20halal&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Though it is not ''[[haraam|haram]]'' (forbidden) or subject to punishment, a person who abstains from this act will be rewarded.&lt;ref name=aldin/&gt; [[Muslim]]s are encouraged to avoid such actions when or as possible. It is one of the degrees of approval (''[[ahkam]]'') in [[sharia|Islamic law]].

==Examples==

Examples of something considered ''Makruh'' are the use of a great amount of water for the pre-[[Salat|prayer]] [[Ritual purification|ablutions]] (ritual washings) known as the ''[[wudu]]'' and ''[[ghusl]]'', the consumption of [[garlic]] before attending the mosque or socializing with others,&lt;ref name=aldin&gt;{{cite book|last1=al-Dīn|first1=Mūʼil Yūsuf ʻIzz|title=Islamic Law: From Historical Foundations to Contemporary Practice|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQzVVL8zI0sC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Makruh+example&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dUS8U-mvMoWHyATB04GADQ&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Makruh%20example&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[divorce in Islam|divorce]].&lt;ref name=women-sonbol&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sonbol|editor1-first=Amira El Azhary|title=Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History|publisher=Syracuse University Press|page=265|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLUgscG6zFYC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;lpg=PA265&amp;dq=Makruh+divorce&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=akRWoNKBoP&amp;sig=oTDIqYZkPSSAjM96k2Adx2VhR90&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=q0a8U5GILNOUyASbxYK4BQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Makruh%20divorce&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a food which is considered ''Makruh'' for Muslims of the [[Hanafi]] [[Madh'hab]] is [[prawns]] (but only for Hanafi Madh'hab).&lt;ref&gt;Lawful to you is the pursuit of water game and its use for food, for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel; ….[5:96]..&lt;/ref&gt;  There are, however, shared attitudes within the Hanafi school of whether shrimp are considered water game and are thereby [[halal]]. Hanafis believe that you should refrain from it and eat something else if possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://spa.qibla.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=2990&amp;CATE=107|title=Ruling on Shrimp|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222206/http://spa.qibla.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=2990&amp;CATE=107|archivedate=2013-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of ''Makruh'' acts in Islam include [[Profanity|swearing]], talking while taking [[wudu]] for prayer, and slaughtering an animal for food where other animals of its kind can see.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

{{italic title}}
'''''Manna''''' is a 2003 [[science fiction]] essay by [[Marshall Brain]] that explores several issues in modern information technology and user interfaces, including some around [[transhumanism]].

==Plot summary==

The fictional story is set in 2050 and takes place in [[Cary, North Carolina]] before the narrator flies to [[Australia]].  The narrator starts at a minimum wage job at Burger-G before being laid-off, primarily due to the Manna, a computer management system, replacing people in the service industry.  He then takes a bus to a small government provided welfare dormitory where he meets a friend.  Soon after, he is visited by two girls who tell him that he's invited to live in Australia because his father bought stock in the Australia Project years prior.  The narrator then goes on to discover the many aspects of the Australia Project.

In the US, which has a libertarian economic system, most Americans are unemployable and live in cramped housing projects, where they are fed and kept safe like farm animals. Birth control medicine in the water prevents them from having children. In contrast, in Australia, everyone has access to the goods provided by automation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=White|first1=Mark|title='I wasn't interested in just following the rules': Data scientist Jeremy Howard and the 'next internet'|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/innovation/i-wasnt-interested-in-just-following-the-rules-data-scientist-jeremy-howard-and-the-next-internet-20160419-go9rps.html|accessdate=30 November 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
''Manna'' is meant to be a thought-provoking read or conceptual prototype rather than an entertaining novel (''see [[exploratory engineering]] for more on such writing'').  The novel shows two possible outcomes of the 'robotic revolution' in the near future: one outcome is a [[dystopia]] based around US capitalism and the other is a [[utopia]] based upon a communal and technological society in Australia.  Essentially, the two differ in that lower-class humans in the dystopic society have been left unmodified and are controlled by AI "managers" to the point of slavery, while humans in the utopian society more directly and efficiently participate in the management of the society as a whole and most or all willingly accept implanted AI aids.

Some technological and social themes explored :
* [[brain-computer interface]]
* [[enterprise resource planning]]
* [[class structure]]
* effect of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robot]]s on society
* proper and improper uses of technology
* the failings of capitalism to cope with technological development
* [[welfare economics]] and a [[basic income]]

Positions and assumptions presented in the novel include:
*Insertion of an AI management system between workers and decision makers results in a loss of upward mobility in a society due to the impossibility of workers ever becoming actual managers.
*The acceptance of nervous system modification and integration of human and machine consciousness into what is considered "human" is accordingly presented as a path to liberation and practical [[egalitarianism]].
*Capitalism is inherently hierarchical and cannot be easily reconciled with abundance, it will by definition move more resources into the hands of the property owners and destitute all others - the novel shares this assumption with classic [[Marxism]].
*Privacy is largely incompatible with human safety in a utopian environment.

The book can be read online for free (see link below).

== Early life ==
Mary Agnes Smith was born in [[Nottingham]] in February 1857, and emigrated to Australia at the age of 12, on The Southern Belle landing in [[Brisbane|Brisbane, Queensland]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64051912|title=A Versatile Lady.|last=Sowden|first=William|date=1924-12-23|work=Register (Adelaide, SA : 1901 – 1929)|access-date=2017-09-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married James Magyer at [[Burra, South Australia]] and as Mary Agnes Mayger, she and her husband were employed at [[Mount Gipps Station]], near [[Broken Hill]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mount Gipps was managed by [[George McCulloch (mine owner)|George McCulloch]], a founder of the [[Syndicate of Seven]] in 1883, and Director of the [[BHP|Broken Hill Mining Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45919529|title=The Broken Hill Mines|last=|first=|date=1925-12-15|work=Barrier Miner (Broken Hill, NSW : 1888 – 1954)|access-date=2017-09-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed in 1855.


Her first husband died at Sydney in 1892 and in 1893 she married George McCulloch in London.

== Art collection ==
During her marriage to George McCulloch the couple developed a significant collection of artworks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rbkclocalstudies.wordpress.com/2013/02/14/mrs-mccullochs-house/|title=Mrs McCulloch’s house|last=Walker|first=Dave|date=2013-02-14|website=The Library Time Machine|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1894 they built a house at No. 184 [[Queen's Gate|Queen's Gate, London]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/michie.html|title=Lost Hospitals of London|last=|first=|date=|website=ezitis.myzen.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which housed these works.

Following McCulloch's death in 1907,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Mary married third the Scottish artist [[James Coutts Michie]] in 1909&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; who had been an art adviser to the couple. An exhibition of the McCulloch Collection of Modern Art was shown at [[Burlington House]] in 1909, as the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] Winter Exhibition.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-malvern-hills.uk/other_history_art_mcc_painting.htm|title=Barnett Samuel Marks (Victorian painter)|website=www.the-malvern-hills.uk|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 her third husband died&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and a portion of the McCulloch collection was sold.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://1914-1918.invisionzone.com/forums/topic/55698-the-michie-hospital-queens-gate/|title=The Michie Hospital, Queen's Gate|website=Great War Forum|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 she bequeathed paintings to the Broken Hill Art Gallery and to the [[Art Gallery of South Australia]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; including a portrait of George McCulloch painted by James Coutts Michie.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Wartime service ==
During World War I Coutts Michie provided her home as a British [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] Hospital which was known as the Michie Hospital, or the Queen's Gate Hospital.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In retirement Coutts Michie lived in a house known as  'Broken Hill,' in [[Cobham, Surrey]]. She died on 29 November 1945 at the age of 88 years.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Media ethics''' is the subdivision of [[applied ethics]] dealing with the specific ethical principles and standards of [[mass media|media]], including [[broadcast media]], [[film]], [[theatre]], the [[arts]], [[print media]] and the internet. The field covers many varied and highly controversial topics, ranging from [[War correspondent|war journalism]] to [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] ad campaigns.

Media ethics involves promoting and defending values such as a universal respect for life and  the rule of law and legality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moldovan|first=Gratian|date=|title=Media Ethics in the Ideological Context of the Twentieth Century|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=13&amp;sid=b975b2a4-ca3c-4480-9425-5f5ed6a3ec10%40sessionmgr4006|journal=Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice|volume=6|pages=589–593|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature regarding the ways in which specifically the Internet impacts media ethics in journalism online is scarce, thereby complicating the idea for a universal code of media ethics.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deuze I, Yeshua II|first=Mark I, Daphna II|date=December 2001|title=Online Journalists Face New Ethical Dilemmas: Lessons From The Netherlands|url=|journal=Journal of Mass Media Ethics|volume=16|pages=273–292|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Media Ethics ==
Research and publications in the field of information ethics has been produced since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Froehlich|first=Thomas|date=December 2004|title=A Brief History of Information Ethics|url=http://bid.ub.edu/13froel2.htm|journal=Universitat de Barcelona. Facultat de Biblioteconomia i Documentació|volume=|pages=|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable figures include and Robert Hauptman (who focused his work specifically on censorship, privacy, access to information, balance in collection development, copyright, fair use, and codes of ethics), [[Rafael Capurro]], Barbara J. Kostrewski and Charles Oppenheim (who wrote the article "''“Ethics in Information Science”'' , discussing issues as confidentiality of information, bias in information provided to clients or consumers, the quality of data supplied by online vendors, etc).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the 1990s, the term "information ethics" began to be explored by various Computer Science and Information departments in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the late 1990s, textbooks such as Richard Severson's ''The Principles of Information Ethics'' and Marsha Cook Woodbury's ''Computer and Information Ethics'', and Deborah G. Johnson's ''Computer Ethics'' were published.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Areas of Media Ethics ==

Media ethics:  Issues of moral principles and values as applied to the conduct, roles, and *content of the mass media, in particular [[journalism ethics and standards]] and [[marketing ethics]];  also the field of study concerned with this topic. In relation to news coverage it includes issues such as [[impartiality]], [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], [[wikt:balance|balance]], [[bias]], privacy, and the [[public interest]]. More generally, it also includes [[stereotyping]], taste and decency, [[obscenity]], [[freedom of speech]], advertising practices such as [[product placement]], and legal issues such as [[defamation]]. On an institutional level it includes debates over [[media ownership]] and control, [[commercialization]], accountability, the relation of the media to the political system, issues arising from regulation (e.g. [[censorship]]) and [[deregulation]].

=== Ethics of journalism ===
{{main|Journalism ethics and standards}}
[[Image:Starlette.jpg|thumb|Photographers crowd around a starlet at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].]]

The ethics of journalism is one of the most well-defined branches of media ethics, primarily because it is frequently taught in
[[journalism schools|schools of journalism]]. Journalistic ethics tend to dominate media ethics, sometimes almost to the exclusion of other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040515000000*/http://smi.curtin.edu.au/netstudies/docs/allen/AllenNCW2001.doc|title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Topics covered by journalism ethics include:
* News manipulation. News can manipulate and be manipulated. Governments and corporations may attempt to manipulate news media; governments, for example, by [[censorship]], and corporations by share ownership. The methods of manipulation are subtle and many. Manipulation may be voluntary or involuntary. Those being manipulated may not be aware of this. See: [[news propaganda]].
* [[Truth]]. Truth may conflict with many other values.
** Public interest. Revelation of military secrets and other sensitive government information may be contrary to the [[public interest]], even if it is true. However, [[public interest]] is not a term which is easy to define.
** Privacy. Salacious details of the lives of public figures is a central content element in many media. Publication is not necessarily justified simply because the information is true. [[Privacy]] is also a [[rights|right]], and one which conflicts with [[free speech]]. See: [[paparazzi]].
** Fantasy. Fantasy is an element of entertainment, which is a legitimate goal of media content. Journalism may mix fantasy and truth, with resulting ethical dilemmas. See: [[National Enquirer]], [[Jayson Blair]] scandal, [[Adnan Hajj photographs controversy]].
** Taste. Photo journalists who cover war and disasters confront situations which may shock the sensitivities of their audiences. For example, human remains are rarely screened. The ethical issue is how far should one risk shocking an audience's sensitivities in order to correctly and fully report the truth. See [[photojournalism]].
* Conflict with the law. Journalistic ethics may conflict with the law over issues such as the protection of confidential [[news source]]s. There is also the question of the extent to which it is ethically acceptable to break the law in order to obtain news. For example, undercover reporters may be engaging in [[deception]], [[trespass]] and similar [[torts]] and crimes. See [[undercover journalism]], [[investigative journalism]].

=== Online Journalism ===
The Internet has shaped and redefined various ethical and moral issues for both online journalists and journalists  utilizing online resources.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

While some journalists continue to adhere to ethical principles of traditional journalism, many journalists believe that with the absence of a mutually agreed upon code of ethics specifically pertaining to internet ethics, and lack of literature dealing specifically with the ways in which the Internet impacts media ethics in journalism online, the online environment poses new threats to the profession.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== Core Issues of Media Ethics in Online Journalism ====
Some of the core issues of media ethics in online journalism include commercial pressures, accuracy and credibility (which include he issues dealing with hyperlinks), verification of facts, regulation, privacy, and news-gathering methods.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Ethics of entertainment media ===
Issues in the ethics of entertainment media include:
* The depiction of violence and sex, and the presence of [[strong language]]. Ethical guidelines and legislation in this area are common and many media (e.g. film, computer games) are subject to ratings systems and supervision by agencies. An extensive guide to international systems of enforcement can be found under [[motion picture rating system]].
* “Fluff or “Celebrity News”: Over the years, print media has been dying out so journalists began to report on what is referred to as “Celebrity News”, or “Fluff.” As more outlets adopt this topic to report on, people become dependent on them. According to Alden Weight, most people know not to completely trust these outlets due to ethical discrepancies, but the issue arises when people who are not as mature or educated find these reports to be completely true.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weight|first=Alden|date=Spring 2011|title=Making A Monkey Look Good: The Case For Consumer Ethics of Entertainment Media|url=|journal=Teaching Ethics|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{POV check inline}}
* [[Product placement]]. An increasingly common [[marketing]] tactic is the placement of products in entertainment media. The producers of such media may be paid high sums to display branded products. The practice is controversial and largely unregulated. Detailed article: [[product placement]].
* Advertising: Attraction and persuasion are currently found in modern journalism. It is found that these methods of advertising may alter an audience’s point of view of what is realistic and falsified information.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;
* [[Stereotypes]]. Both advertising and entertainment media make heavy use of [[stereotypes]]. Stereotypes may negatively affect people's perceptions of themselves or promote socially undesirable behavior. The stereotypical portrayals of [[men]], [[affluence]] and [[ethnic groups]] are examples of major areas of debate
***Women in Media: Entertainment media often exploits female bodies by objectifying and de-humanizing them. By doing so, the concept of female bodies being bought and sold becomes common.
***Media outlets usually use either images or imagery of female bodies to counter negative news that is provided throughout the day.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;
* Taste and [[taboos]]. Entertainment media often questions of our [[values]] for artistic and entertainment purposes. [[Normative ethics]] is often about moral values, and what kinds should be enforced and protected. In media ethics, these two sides come into conflict. In the name of art, media may deliberately attempt to break with existing norms and shock the audience. That poses ethical problems when the norms abandoned are closely associated with certain relevant moral values or obligations.  The extent to which this is acceptable is always a hotbed of ethical controversy. See: [[Turner Prize]], [[obscenity]], [[freedom of speech]], [[aesthetics]].

=== Media and democracy ===
In democratic countries, a special relationship exists between media and government. Although the freedom of the media may be [[constitution]]ally enshrined and have precise legal definition and enforcement, the exercise of that freedom by individual journalists is a matter of personal choice and ethics.
Modern democratic government subsists in [[Representation (politics)|representation]] of millions by hundreds. For the representatives to be [[accountability|accountable]], and for the process of government to be [[transparency (humanities)|transparent]], effective communication paths must exist to their [[Electoral district|constituents]]. Today these paths consist primarily of the mass media, to the extent that if [[press freedom]] disappeared, so would most political [[accountability]].
In this area, media ethics merges with issues of [[civil rights]] and [[politics]]. Issues include: 
* Subversion of [[media independence]] by financial interests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Moyers]], [http://www.thenation.com/article/media-and-democracy Media and Democracy], [[The Nation]] (Editorial), December 15, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* Government monitoring of media for intelligence gathering against its own people. See, for example, [[NSA call database]].
See: [[freedom of information]], [[media transparency]] [[Right to Information]].

=== Media integrity ===
Media integrity refers to the ability of a media outlet to serve the [[public interest]] and [[democratic process]], making it resilient to institutional [[corruption]] within the media system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wiki.lessig.org/Institutional_Corruption|title = Institutional Corruption|last = Lessig|first = Lawrence|website = wiki.lessig.org|access-date = 2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; economy of influence, conflicting dependence and political clientelism. Media integrity encompasses following qualities of a media outlet: 
* [[Editorial independence|independence]] from private or political interests
* [[Media transparency|transparency]] about own financial interests
* commitment to [[journalism ethics and standards]]
* responsiveness to citizens

The concept was devised particularly for the media systems in the region of [[Southeast Europe|South East Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://mediaobservatory.net/sites/default/files/media%20integrity%20matters_za%20web_FINAL.pdf|title = Media Integrity Matters: Reclaiming Public Service Values in Media and Journalism: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia|last =|first =|publisher = Peace Institute|year = 2014|isbn =|editor-last = Petković|editor-first = Brankica|location = Ljubljana|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the project [http://mediaobservatory.net/about South East European Media Observatory], gathering organisations which are part of the [http://seenpm.org/about-us/ South East European Network for Professionalization of Media (SEENPM)].

== Attempts to Develop a Universal Code of Media Ethics ==
Within the last two decades, numerous regional discussions have taken place in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia in order to create a universal code of ethics for the information society.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Capurro; Britz|first=Rafael; Johannes B.|date=2010|title=In Search of a Code of Global Information Ethics: The Road Travelled and New Horizons|url=http://www.communicationethics.net/journal/v7n2-3/v7n2-3_feat2.pdf|journal=Ethical Space: The International Journal of Communication Ethics|volume=7|pages=|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the core issues in developing a universal code for media ethics is the difficulty of finding a common ground between ethical principles from one culture to another.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Also, such codes may be interpreted differently according to various moral and legal standards.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== UNESCO INFOethics Congresses ===
The ethical facet of the global information society has been on the [[UNESCO]] (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) agenda since 1997, when the organization initiated their first INFOethics Congress.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The objective of this summit was to spark debate on the ethical dimension of the global information society.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The UNESCO INFOethics Congresses then met in 1998 and 2000, where specialists coming from a wide range of educational, scientific, and cultural environments addressed the ethical dimensions of global media and information.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== International Symposium on Information Ethics, Karlsuhe, 2004 ===
In 2004, the ICIE, or International Center for Information Ethics, organized the firs international symposium on information ethics in [[Karlsruhe|Karlsuhe, Germany]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Experts with varying scientific backgrounds such as computer science, [[information science]], [[media studies]], and economics, gathered from all over the world to discuss the internet from both an ethical and intercultural perspective.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== Contexts of media ethics ==

=== Media ethics and the laws ===

=== Media ethics and media economics ===
Media economics where things such as -- [[deregulation]] of media, [[concentration of media ownership]], [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] regulations in the U.S, media [[trade unions]] and labor issues, and other such worldwide regulating bodies, [[Citizen journalism|citizen media]] ([[Low-power broadcasting|low power FM]], [[community radio]]) -- have ethical implications......

=== Media ethics and public officials ===
The [[mass media|media]] has manipulated the way public officials conduct themselves through the advancement of technology. Constant television coverage displays the legislative proceedings; exposing faster than ever before, unjust rulings throughout the government process. [[Truth]] telling is crucial in media ethics as any opposition of [[truth]] telling is considered [[deception]]. Anything shown by the media whether print or video is considered to be original. When a statement is written in an article or a video is shown of a public official, it is the original “truthful” words of the individual official themselves.

=== Intercultural dimensions of media ethics ===
If values differ interculturally, the issue arises of the extent to which behaviour should be modified in the light of the values of specific cultures. Two examples of controversy from the field of media ethics:
* [[Google China|Google's self-censorship in China]].
* The [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] in Denmark, and subsequently worldwide.

== Meta-issues in media ethics ==
One theoretical question for media ethics is the extent to which media ethics is just another topical subdivision of [[applied ethics]], differing only in terms of case applications and raising no theoretical issues peculiar to itself. The oldest subdivisions of applied ethics are [[medical ethics]] and [[business ethics]]. Does media ethics have anything new to add other than interesting cases?

===Similarities between media ethics and other fields of applied ethics===

[[Privacy]] and [[honesty]] are issues extensively covered in medical ethical literature, as is
the principle of harm-avoidance. The trade-offs between economic goals and social values has been
covered extensively in [[business ethics]] (as well as medical and [[environmental ethics]]).

===Differences between media ethics and other fields of applied ethics===
The issues of [[freedom of speech]] and aesthetic values (taste) are primarily at home in media ethics. However a number of further issues distinguish media ethics as a field in its own right.

A theoretical issue peculiar to media ethics is the identity of ''observer'' and ''observed''. The press is one of the primary guardians in a democratic society of many of the freedoms, rights and duties discussed by other fields of applied ethics. In media ethics the ethical obligations of the guardians themselves comes more strongly into the foreground. Who guards the guardians? This question also arises in the field of [[legal ethics]].

A further self-referentiality or circular characteristic in media ethics is the questioning of its own values. Meta-issues can become identical with the subject matter of media ethics. This is most strongly seen when artistic elements are considered. [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] advertisements and [[Turner prize]] candidates are both examples of ethically questionable media uses which question their own
questioner.

Another characteristic of media ethics is the disparate nature of its goals. Ethical dilemmas emerge when goals conflict. The goals of media usage diverge sharply. Expressed in a consequentialist manner, media usage may be subject to pressures to maximize: economic profits, entertainment value, information provision, the upholding of democratic freedoms, the development of art and culture, fame and vanity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16895">The '''Merton thesis''' is an argument about the nature of early [[experimental science]] proposed by [[Robert K. Merton]]. Similar to [[Max Weber]]'s [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|famous claim]] on the link between [[Protestant work ethic]] and the [[capitalist economy]], Merton argued for a similar positive [[correlation]] between the rise of [[Protestant]] [[Pietism]] and early experimental science.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003&gt;Sztompka, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Merton thesis has resulted in continuous debates.&lt;ref name=cohen1990&gt;Cohen, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Although scholars are still debating it, Merton's 1936 [[doctoral dissertation]] (and two years later his first monograph by the same title) ''Science, Technology and Society in 17th-Century England'' raised important issues on the connections between religion and the rise of modern science, became a significant work in the realm of the [[sociology of science]] and continues to be cited in new scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/record/archives/vol20/vol20_iss2/record2002.13.html Merton Awarded Nation's Highest Science Honor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Merton further developed this thesis in other publications.

==Thesis==

The Merton thesis has two separate parts: firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and [[methodology]]; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in [[England]] in the 17th century, and the religious [[demography]] of the [[Royal Society]] (English scientists of that time were predominantly [[Puritans]] or other [[Protestants]]) can be explained by a [[correlation]] between Protestantism and the scientific values.&lt;ref name=gregory1998&gt;Gregory, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Merton focuses on English Puritanism and [[Spener|German Pietism]] as being responsible for the development of the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th and 18th centuries. He explains that the connection between [[religious affiliation]] and interest in science is a result of a significant synergy between the [[ascetic]] Protestant values and those of modern science.&lt;ref name=becker1992&gt;Becker, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify [[God|God's]] influence on the world and thus providing religious justification for scientific research.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003/&gt;

==Criticism==

The first part of Merton's thesis has been criticized for insufficient consideration of the roles of [[mathematics]] and the [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical philosophy]] in the scientific revolution. The second part has been criticized for the difficulty involved in defining who counts as a Protestant of the "right type" without making arbitrary distinctions. It is also criticized for failing to explain why non-Protestants do science (consider the [[List of Catholic scientists|Catholics]] [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], or [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]) and conversely why Protestants of the "right type" are not all interested in science.&lt;ref name=gregory1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=ferngren&gt;Ferngen, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=porter1992&gt;Porter &amp; Teich 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Merton, acknowledging the criticism, replied that the Puritan ethos was not necessary, although it did facilitate development of science.&lt;ref&gt;Heddendorf, 1986]&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted that when science had acquired institutional legitimacy, it no longer needed religion, eventually becoming a counterforce, leading to religious decline. Nonetheless, early on, in Merton's view religion was a major factor that allowed the  scientific revolution to occur.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003 /&gt; While the Merton thesis does not explain all the causes of the scientific revolution, it does illuminate possible reasons why England was one of its driving motors and the structure of the English scientific community.&lt;ref name=cohen1994&gt;Cohen, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==

In 1958, American sociologist [[Gerhard Lenski]]'s empirical inquiry into ''The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics, and Family Life'' in the [[Detroit]] area (Michigan) revealed, among other insights, that there were significant differences between [[Roman Catholic church|Catholics]] on the one hand and [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|(white) Protestants]] and [[Jews]] on the other hand with regard to economics and the sciences. Lenski's data supported the basic hypotheses of [[Max Weber]]'s work ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''. According to Lenski, the "contributions of Protestantism to material progress have been largely unintended by-products of certain distinctive Protestant traits. This was a central point in Weber's theory." Lenski noted that more than a hundred years prior to Weber, [[John Wesley]], one of the founders of the [[Methodist church]], had observed that "diligence and frugality" made Methodists wealthy. "In an early era, Protestant [[asceticism]] and dedication to work, as noted both by Wesley and Weber, seem to have been important patterns of action contributing to economic progress." However, Lenski said, asceticism was rare among modern Protestants, and the distinctive Protestant doctrine of "the calling" was largely forgotten. Instead, modern (white) Protestants and Jews had a high degree of "intellectual autonomy" that facilitated scientific and technical advance.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski (1963), ''The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics, and Family Life'', Revised Edition, Garden City, N.Y., pp. 350-352&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Lenski pointed out, Catholics developed an intellectual orientation which valued "obedience" to the teachings of their church above intellectual autonomy, which made them less inclined to enter scientific careers. Catholic sociologists&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. O'Dea (1958), ''The Catholic Dilemma: An Inquiry into the Intellectual Life'', New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank L. Christ and Gerard Sherry (Eds.) (1961), ''American Catholicism and the Intellectual Ideal'', New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; had come to the same conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski, ''The Religious Factor'', pp. 283-284&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenski traced these differences back to the [[Reformation]] and the Catholic church's reaction to it. In Lenski's view, the Reformation encouraged intellectual autonomy among Protestants, in particular the [[Anabaptists]], Puritans, Pietists, Methodists, and [[Presbyterian church|Presbyterians]]. In the Middle Ages, there had been tendencies toward intellectual autonomy, as exemplified in men like [[Erasmus]]. But after the Reformation, the Catholic leaders increasingly identified these tendencies with Protestantism and [[heresy]] and demanded that Catholics be obedient and faithful to ecclesiastical discipline. In Lenski's opinion, his study showed that these differences between Protestants and Catholics survived to the present day. As a consequence, "none of the predominantly and devoutly Catholic nations in the modern world can be classified as a ''leading'' industrial nation. Some Catholic nations – such as [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and [[Chile]] – are quite highly industrialized, but none of them are leaders in the technological and scientific fields, nor do they seem likely to become so. Recently [1963] some Brazilian Catholic social scientists compared their country's progress with that of the United States and concluded that the chief factor responsible for the differential rates of development is the religious heritage of the two nations."&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski, ''The Religious Factor'', pp. 347-349&lt;/ref&gt;

Puritans and Pietists both contributed to intellectual autonomy and provided intellectual tools and values important for science.&lt;ref name="gregory19982"&gt;Gregory, Andrew (1998). handouts for course 'The Scientific Revolution' at The [[Scientific Revolution]], [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/gregory/215/handouts/h14_srel.doc doc file online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513160014/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/gregory/215/handouts/h14_srel.doc |date=2006-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, pietism challenged the orthodoxy via new media and formats: Periodical journals gained importance versus the former pasquills and single thesis, traditional [[disputation]] was replaced by competitive debating, which tried to gain new knowledge instead of defending orthodox scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gierl, [[Pietismus und Aufklärung: theologische Polemik und die Kommunikationsreform der Wissenschaft am Ende des 17.

According to ''Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States'' by [[Harriet Zuckerman]], a review of American Nobel prizes awarded between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American [[Nobel Prizes|Nobel Prize]] laureates identified a [[Protestant]] background.&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United Statesh"&gt;[[Harriet Zuckerman]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HAHCzJfmD5IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Scientific+Elite:+Nobel+Laureates+in+the+United+States&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAGoVChMIxKistOqUxwIVzNUUCh0pGgC-#v=onepage&amp;q=Scientific%20Elite%3A%20Nobel%20Laureates%20in%20the%20United%20States&amp;f=false Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States]'' New York, The Free Pres, 1977 , p.68: Protestants turn up among the American-reared laureates in slightly greater proportion to their numbers in the general population.

According to ''100 Years of Nobel Prize (2005)'', a review of Nobel prizes awarded between 1901 and 2000, 65.4% of [[Nobel Prizes|Nobel Prize]] Laureates, [[List of Christian Nobel laureates|have identified Christianity]] in its various forms as their religious preference (423 prizes).&lt;ref name="Nobel prize"&gt;Baruch A.

While separating Roman Catholic from Protestants among Christians proved difficult in some cases, available information suggests that more Protestants were involved in the scientific categories and more Catholics were involved in the Literature and Peace categories.
Atheists, agnostics, and freethinkers comprise 10.5% of total Nobel Prize winners; but in the category of Literature, these preferences rise sharply to about 35%. A striking fact involving religion is the high number of Laureates of the Jewish faith – over 20% of total Nobel Prizes (138); including: 17% in Chemistry, 26% in Medicine and Physics, 40% in Economics and 11% in Peace and Literature each. The numbers are especially startling in light of the fact that only some 14 million people (0.02% of the world's population) are Jewish. By contrast, only 5 Nobel Laureates have been of the Muslim faith-0.8% of total number of Nobel prizes awarded – from a population base of about 1.2 billion (20% of the world's population).&lt;/ref&gt;  While 32% of Nobel prize winners have identified with Protestantism in its various forms (208 prizes),&lt;ref name="Nobel prize"/&gt; Protestants comprise 11.6–13% of the world's population but most{{how many|date=January 2018}} of those selecting the prize winners{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}.

'''Mi'kma'ki''' or '''Mi'gma'gi''' is the traditional and current territories of the [[Mi'kmaq]] people. It is shared by an [[Non-governmental organization|inter-Nation forum]] between Mi'kmaq [[First Nations]] and is divided into seven geographical and traditional districts, with an eighth representing [[Newfoundland (island)|Taqamkuk]] today. Mi'kma'ki is one of the confederate countries within [[Wabanaki Confederacy|Wabanaki]].

Each district was autonomous, headed by a ''[[Sachem|Sagamaw]]'', who would gather alongside [[Wampum]] readers and knowledge keepers called ''Putu's'', a women's council and the ''Kji Sagamaw'', or Grand Chief, to form the [[Grand Council (Mi'kmaq)|''Sante''' or ''Mi'kmawey Mawio'mi'']] (Grand Council).&lt;ref name="Diss"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McMillan|first1=Leslie Jane|title=Mi'kmawey Mawio'mi: Changing Roles of the Mi'kmaq Grand Council From the Early Seventeenth Century to the Present|date=December 1996|pages=219|url=http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq24981.pdf|accessdate=26 September 2017|publisher=Dalhousie University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seat of the Sante' Mawio'mi is at [[Chapel Island (Canada)|Mniku]] in [[Cape Breton Island|Unama'kik]] and still functions as the capital today in the [[Potlotek]] reserve.

Following contact, Mi'kma'ki was colonized by the French [[Acadia|Acadian]] and British [[Nova Scotia]] colonies and their competing claims for the land. Siding with the French, the Mi'kmaq fought alongside other Wabanaki troops during the [[French and Indian Wars|global wars between 1688-1763]]. The European powers divided Mi'kma'ki in the treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Paris (1763)]]. The British claimed Mi'kma'ki as their possession by conquest and the defeated Mi'kmaq signed the Peace and Friendship Treaties to end hostilities and encourage cooperation between the Wabanaki countries and the British and ensure the survival of the Mi'kmaq people whose numbers had dwindled to a few thousand from disease and starvation. The power held within Mi'kma'ki faded further after the Confederation of Canada united the colonies and Canada passed the [[Indian Act]], and the loss of autonomous governance. 

Today, the Sante' Mawio'mi functions solely as a spiritual and dialogue forum, with oversight held by the [[Government of Canada]] through Mi'kmaq First Nations instead of Mi'kma'ki and the Kji Sagamaw. The traditional lands' sovereignty has never been ceded by the Mi'kmaq,{{sfn|Paul|2000|p=160}} although legal arguments have been made that the Peace and Friendship treaties legitimized the takeover of the land by Britain.

==Governance==
[[File:Micmac camp.jpg|thumb|left|Mi'kmaq camp in [[Unama'kik]] in 1857]]

Traditionally each district had its own independent government. Those governments were composed of a chief and a council. The council included the band chiefs, elders and other important leaders. The role of the councils was similar to those of any independent government and included to edict laws, establish a justice system, divide the territory for hunting and fishing, make war and search for peace. 

The overarching [[Grand Council (Mi'kmaq)|Grand Council Sante Mawiomi]] was composed of the ''keptinaq'' (captains), the district chiefs. The Grand Council also included elders, ''putus'' (historians reading the belts) and a Council of women. The Grand Council was headed by a grand chief who was one of the district chiefs, generally the Unama'kik chief. Succession was hereditary. The seat of the Grand Council was generally on [[Cape Breton Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mi'kmaq |url=https://intercontinentalcry.org/indigenous-peoples/mikmaq/ |website=Intercontinental Cry |access-date=2 December 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3042">'''Multi-function material''' is a [[composite material]]. The traditional approach to the development of structures is to address the loadcarrying function and other functional requirements separately. Recently, however, there has been increased interest in the development of load-bearing materials and structures which have integral non-load-bearing functions, guided by recent discoveries about how multifunctional [[biological system]]s work.&lt;ref&gt;A review of recent research on mechanics of multifunctional composite, Journal of Composite Structures 92 (2010) 2793–2810&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
With conventional structural materials, it has been difficult to achieve simultaneous improvement in multiple structural functions, but the increasing use of [[composite material]]s has been driven in part by the potential for such improvements. The multi-functions can vary from mechanical to electrical and thermal functions. The most widely used composites have polymer matrix materials, which are typically poor conductors. Enhanced conductivity could be achieved with reinforcing the composite with [[carbon nanotubes]] for instance.&lt;ref&gt;"Sensors and actuators based on carbon nanotubes and their composite" J. Composites Science and Technology 68 (2008) 1227–1249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Challenges and opportunities in multifunctional nanocomposite structures for aerospace applications. MRS Bull 2007;32(4):324-34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
Among the many functions that can be attained are Electrical/thermal conductivity, Sensing and actuation, Energy harvesting/storage, Self-healing capability, Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and recyclability and biodegradability. See also [[Functionally graded material| Functionally graded materials (FGM)]] which are [[composite materials]] where the composition or the microstructure are locally varied so that a certain variation of the local material properties is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeaw.ac.at/esi/english/research/materials/comp/fgms.html O. Kolednik, Functionally Graded Materials, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820130401/http://www.oeaw.ac.at/esi/english/research/materials/comp/fgms.html |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, FGM can be designed for specific function and applications.

Many applications such as Re-configurable aircraft wings, shape-changing aerodynamic panels for flow control, Variable geometry engine exhausts, turbine blade, wind turbine configuration at different wind speed, Microelectromechanical systems (micro-switches), mechanical memory cells, valves, micropumps,Flexible direction panel position in solar cells,Innovative architecture (adaptive shape panels for roofs and windows), Flexible and foldable electronic devices and Optics (shape changing mirrors for active focusing in adaptive optical systems)

[[File:BassoonKeys.png |thumb|right|200px|The modern [[bassoon]] was only feasible as an instrument when the mechanical technology for creating precise key mechanisms was developed. In the 2010s, flutes, clarinets and many other woodwind instruments use similar key mechanisms.]]
'''Mechanical music technology''' is the use of any device, mechanism, machine or tool by a musician or composer to make or perform music; to [[musical composition|compose]], [[music notation|notate]], play back or [[sound recording|record]] songs or pieces; or to analyze or edit music. The earliest known applications of technology to music was prehistoric peoples' use of a tool to hand-drill holes in bones to make simple flutes. [[Ancient Egypt]]ians developed stringed instruments, such as [[harp]]s, [[lyre]]s and [[lute]]s, which required making thin strings and some type of peg system for adjusting the pitch of the strings. Ancient Egyptians also used wind instruments such as [[double clarinet]]s and percussion instruments such as [[cymbals]]. In [[Ancient Greece]], instruments included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the lyre. Numerous instruments are referred to in the Bible, including the [[horn (instrument)|horn]], pipe, lyre, harp, and [[bagpipe]]. During Biblical times, the cornet, flute, horn, organ, pipe, and trumpet were also used. During the [[Middle Ages]], hand-written [[music notation]] was developed to write down the notes of religious [[Plainchant]] melodies; this notation enabled the [[Catholic church]] to disseminate the same chant melodies across its entire empire.

During the [[Renaissance music]] era, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made it much easier to mass-produce music (which had previously been hand-copied). This helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. During the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] (1600–1750), technologies for keyboard instruments developed, which led to improvements in the designs of pipe organs and harpsichords, and the development of a new keyboard instrument in about 1700, the piano. In the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]] (1750–1820), [[Beethoven]] added new instruments to the orchestra to create new sounds, such as the [[piccolo]], [[contrabassoon]], [[trombone]]s, and [[Bass drum|untuned percussion]] in his [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]]. During the [[Romantic music]] era (c. 1810 to 1900), one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of relatively inexpensive [[sheet music]], which amateur middle class music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other instruments. In the 19th century, new instruments such as [[piston valve]]-equipped [[cornet]]s, saxophones, [[euphonium]]s, and [[Wagner tuba]]s were added to the orchestra. Many of the mechanical innovations developed for instruments in the 19th century, notably on the piano, brass and woodwinds continued to be used in the 20th and early 21st century.

Findings from [[paleolithic]] archaeology sites suggest that prehistoric people used carving and piercing tools to create instruments. Archeologists have found [[Paleolithic flutes]] carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced. The [[Divje Babe flute]], carved from a [[cave bear]] [[femur]], is thought to be at least 40,000 years old.

===References in the Bible===
{{Main article|History of music in the biblical period}}
[[File:David-harp.jpg|thumb|right|170px|"David with his harp", from the [[Paris Psalter]], c. 960, [[Constantinople]].]]

According to the [[Scriptures]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was the father of harpists and organists (Gen. 4:20–21). The harp was among the chief instruments and the favorite of [[David]], and it is referred to more than fifty times in the Bible. It was used at both joyful and mournful ceremonies, and its use was "raised to its highest perfection under David" (1 Sam. 16:23). Lockyer adds that "It was the sweet music of the harp that often dispossessed Saul of his melancholy (1 Sam. 16:14–23; 18:10–11).&lt;ref name=Lockyer&gt;Lockyer, Herbert Jr. ''All the Music of the Bible'', Hendrickson Publ. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} When the Jews were captive in Babylon they hung their harps up and refused to use them while in exile, earlier being part of the instruments used in the Temple (1 Kgs. 10:12). Another stringed instrument of the harp class, and one also used by the ancient Greeks, was the [[lyre]].  A similar instrument was the [[lute]], which had a large pear-shaped body, long neck, and fretted fingerboard with head screws for tuning. Coins displaying musical instruments, the [[Bar Kochba Revolt coinage]], were issued by the Jews during the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Second Jewish Revolt]] against the Roman Empire of 132–135 AD. 
[[File:Miriams Tanz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Miriam]] and women celebrate the crossing of the [[Red Sea]] with "timbrels" (small hand drums) (from the [[Tomić Psalter]]).]]In addition there was the [[psaltery]], another stringed instrument which is referred to almost thirty times in Scripture. According to [[Josephus]], it had twelve strings and was played with a [[quill]], not with the hand. Another writer suggested that it was like a guitar, but with a flat triangular form and strung from side to side.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|49}}

Among the wind instruments used in the biblical period were the [[cornet]], wood flute, [[Horn (instrument)|horn]], organ, [[pipe (instrument)|pipe]], and early trumpet.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|50}} There were also silver trumpets and the double [[oboe]]. Werner concludes that from the measurements taken of the trumpets on the [[Arch of Titus]] in Rome and from coins, that "the trumpets were very high pitched with thin body and shrill sound." He adds that in ''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'', a manual for military organization and strategy discovered among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], these trumpets "appear clearly capable of regulating their pitch pretty accurately, as they are supposed to blow rather complicated signals in unison."&lt;ref name=Werner&gt;Werner, Eric. ''The Sacred Bridge'', Columbia Univ. Press (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Whitcomb writes that the pair of silver trumpets were fashioned according to [[Torah|Mosaic law]] and were probably among the trophies which the [[Emperor Titus]] brought to Rome when he conquered Jerusalem. She adds that on the Arch raised to the victorious Titus, "there is a sculptured relief of these trumpets, showing their ancient form. (see photo)&lt;ref name=Whitcomb&gt;Whitcomb, Ida Prentice. ''Young People's Story of Music'', Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. (1928)&lt;/ref&gt;

The flute was commonly used for festal and mourning occasions, according to Whitcomb. "Even the poorest Hebrew was obliged to employ two flute-players to perform at his wife's funeral."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt; The [[shofar]] (the horn of a ram) is still used for special liturgical purposes such as the [[Jewish New Year]] services in orthodox communities. As such, it is not considered a musical instrument but an instrument of theological symbolism which has been intentionally kept to its primitive character. In ancient times it was used for warning of danger, to announce the new moon or beginning of [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], or to announce the death of a notable. "In its strictly ritual usage it carried the cries of the multitude to God," writes Werner.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|12}}

Among the percussion instruments were [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], [[cymbals]], [[sistrum]], [[tabret]], hand drums, and [[tambourines]]. The tabret, or timbrel, was a small hand-drum used for festive occasions, and was considered a woman's instrument. In modern times it was often used by the Salvation Army. According to the Bible, when the children of Israel came out of Egypt and [[The Exodus|crossed the Red Sea]], ''"[[Miriam]] took a timbrel in her hands; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dance."''&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
[[File:Hydraulis 001.jpg|thumb|The ''[[hydraulis]]'' or "water organ". Note the curved trumpet, called the ''bukanē'' by the Greeks and, later, ''cornu'' by the Romans.]]
In [[Ancient Greece]], instruments in all music can be divided into three categories,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; based on how sound is produced: string, wind, and percussion. The following were among the instruments used in the music of ancient Greece:

*the [[lyre]]: a strummed and occasionally [[plucked string instrument]], essentially a hand-held [[zither]] built on a tortoise-shell frame, generally with seven or more strings tuned to the notes of one of the modes. The lyre was used to accompany others or even oneself for recitation and song.
*the [[kithara]], also a strummed string instrument, more complicated than the [[lyre]]. It had a box-type frame with strings stretched from the cross-bar at the top to the [[sounding box]] at the bottom; it was held upright and played with a [[plectrum]]. The strings were tunable by adjusting wooden wedges along the cross-bar.
* the ''[[aulos]]'', usually double, consisting of two double-reed (like an oboe) pipes, not joined but generally played with a mouth-band to hold both pipes steadily between the player's lips. Modern reconstructions indicate that they produced a low, clarinet-like sound. There is some confusion about the exact nature of the instrument; alternate descriptions indicate single-reeds instead of double reeds.
* the [[Pan pipes]], also known as panflute and [[syrinx]] (Greek συριγξ), (so-called for the nymph who was changed into a reed in order to hide from [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]) is an ancient musical instrument based on the principle of the stopped pipe, consisting of a series of such pipes of gradually increasing length, tuned (by cutting) to a desired scale. Sound is produced by blowing across the top of the open pipe (like blowing across a bottle top).
* the [[hydraulis]], a keyboard instrument, the forerunner of the modern organ. As the name indicates, the instrument used water to supply a constant flow of pressure to the pipes. Two detailed descriptions have survived: that of Vitruvius &lt;ref&gt;''De Architectura'' x, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and Heron of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;''Pneumatica'', I, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptions deal primarily with the keyboard mechanism and with the device by which the instrument was supplied with air. A well-preserved model in pottery was found at Carthage in 1885. Essentially, the air to the pipes that produce the sound comes from a wind-chest connected by a pipe to a dome; air is pumped in to compress water, and the water rises in the dome, compressing the air, and causing a steady supply of air to the pipes.&lt;ref&gt;Williams.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Virgil makes numerous references to the trumpet. The lyre, kithara, aulos, hydraulis (water organ) and trumpet all found their way into the [[Ancient Roman music|music of ancient Rome]].

===Ancient Rome===
[[File:Musicians from Zliten mosaic.JPG|thumb|upright=1.7|Musicians in a detail from the [[Zliten mosaic]] (2nd century AD), originally shown as accompanying [[gladiator]] combat and wild-animal events in the arena: from left, the ''tuba'', ''hydraulis'' (water pipe organ), and two ''cornua'']]
The Romans may have borrowed the Greek method{{Ref|Ulrich and Pisk2}}{{Page needed|date=February 2010}} of 'enchiriadic notation' to record their music, if they used any notation at all. Four letters (in English notation 'A', 'G', 'F' and 'C') indicated a series of four succeeding tones. Rhythm signs, written above the letters, indicated the duration of each note. [[Roman art]] depicts various woodwinds, [[brass instrument|"brass"]], percussion and [[stringed instruments]].{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar313}}  Roman-style instruments are found in parts of the Empire where they did not originate, and indicate that music was among the aspects of Roman culture that spread throughout the provinces.

Roman instruments include:
*The [[Roman tuba|Roman ''tuba'']] was a long, straight bronze trumpet with a detachable, conical mouthpiece. Extant examples are about 1.3 metres long, and have a cylindrical bore from the mouthpiece to the point where the bell flares abruptly,{{Ref|Bonanni}} similar to the modern straight trumpet seen in presentations of 'period music'. Since there were no valves, the ''tuba'' was capable only of a single [[overtone]] series.{{Ref|Pierce}} In the military, it was used for "[[bugle call]]s". The ''tuba'' is also depicted in art such as [[Roman mosaic|mosaics]] accompanying games ''([[ludi]])'' and spectacle events.
*The ''[[cornu (horn)|cornu]]'' (Latin "horn") was a long tubular metal wind instrument that curved around the musician's body, shaped rather like an uppercase ''G''.  It had a conical bore (again like a French horn) and a conical mouthpiece. It may be hard to distinguish from the ''[[buccina]]''. The ''cornu'' was used for military signals and on parade.{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar314}} The ''[[cornicen]]'' was a military signal officer who translated orders into calls. Like the ''tuba'', the ''cornu'' also appears as accompaniment for public events and spectacle entertainments.
*The ''tibia'' (Greek ''[[aulos]] – αὐλός''), usually double, had two double-reed (as in a modern oboe) pipes, not joined but generally played with a mouth-band ''capistrum'' to hold both pipes steadily between the player's lips.{{Ref|Bonanni2}} 
*The ''[[askaules]]'' – a [[bagpipe]].
*Versions of the modern flute and [[panpipes]].
*The [[lyre]], borrowed from the Greeks, was not a [[harp]], but instead had a sounding body of wood or a tortoise shell covered with skin, and arms of animal horn or wood, with strings stretched from a cross bar to the sounding body.{{Ref|Bonanni3}}
*The ''[[cithara]]'' was the premier musical instrument of ancient Rome and was played both in popular and elevated forms of music. Larger and heavier than a lyre, the cithara was a loud, sweet and piercing instrument with precision tuning ability.
*The [[lute]] ([[pandura]] or [[monochord]]) was known by several names among the Greeks and Romans. In construction, the lute differs from the lyre in having fewer strings stretched over a solid neck or [[fingerboard|fret-board]], on which the strings can be [[fret|stopped]] to produce [[interval (music)|graduated]] notes. Each lute string is thereby capable of producing a greater range of notes than a lyre string.{{Ref|Higgins and Winnington-Ingram}} Although long-necked lutes are depicted in art from [[Mesopotamia]] as early as 2340–2198 BC, and also occur in Egyptian iconography, the lute in the Greco-Roman world was far less common than the lyre and cithara. The lute of the medieval West is thought to owe more to the Arab [[oud]], from which its name derives (''al ʿūd'').{{Ref|Spring}}
* The hydraulic pipe organ ''([[hydraulis]])'', which worked by water pressure, was "one of the most significant technical and musical achievements of antiquity".{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar316}} Essentially, the air to the pipes that produce the sound comes from a mechanism of a wind-chest connected by a pipe to a dome; air is pumped in to compress water, and the water rises in the dome, compressing the air and causing a steady supply to reach the pipes{{Ref|Williams}}{{Page needed|date=February 2010}} (also see [[Pipe organ#History]]). The ''hydraulis'' accompanied [[gladiator]] contests and events in the arena, as well as stage performances. 
*Variations of a hinged wooden or metal device called a [[scabellum]] used to beat time. Also, there were various rattles, bells and [[tambourine]]s.
*Drum and percussion instruments like [[timpani]] and castanets, the Egyptian sistrum, and brazen pans, served various musical and other purposes in ancient Rome, including backgrounds for rhythmic dance, celebratory rites like those of the Bacchantes and military uses. 
*The [[sistrum]] was a rattle consisting of rings strung across the cross-bars of a metal frame, which was often used for ritual purposes.
*''Cymbala'' (Lat. plural of ''cymbalum'', from the Greek ''kymbalon'') were small cymbals: metal discs with concave centres and turned rims, used in pairs which were clashed together.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Gregorian chant.gif|frame|A sample of notation for the [[Kyrie|Kýrie Eléison]] XI (Orbis Factor), which is from the ''[[Liber Usualis]]'', which originated in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, Willi. ''Gregorian Chant''. Indiana University Press, 1958. p. 417&lt;/ref&gt; [[Media:Kyrie XI (Orbis Factor) sample.ogg|Listen]] to it interpreted.]]
During the [[Medieval Music]] era (476 to 1400) the [[plainchant]] tunes used by monks for religious songs were primarily monophonic (a single melody line, with no harmony parts) and transmitted by oral tradition ("by ear"). The earliest Medieval music did not have any kind of notational system for writing down melodies. As Rome tried to centralize the various chants across vast distances of its empire, which stretched from Europe to North Africa, a form of music notation was needed to write down the melodies. So long as the church had to rely on teaching people chant melodies "by ear", it limited the number of people who could be taught. As well, when songs are learned by ear, variations and changes naturally slip in.

Various signs written above the chant texts, called ''[[neumes]]'' were introduced. These little signs indicated to the singer whether the melody went up in pitch or down in pitch. By the ninth century, it was firmly established as the primary method of musical notation. The next development in musical notation was "heighted neumes", in which neumes were carefully placed at different heights in relation to each other. This allowed the neumes to give a rough indication of the size of a given interval (e.g., a small interval like a tone or a large interval like a sixth) as well as the direction (up in pitch or down in pitch).

At first the little dots were just placed in the space about the words. However, this method made it hard to determine what pitch a song started on, or when a song was returning to the same pitch. This quickly led to one or two lines, each representing a particular note, being placed on the music with all of the neumes relating back to them, and being placed on or above the lines. The line or lines acted as a reference point to help the singer gauge which notes were higher or lower. At first, these lines had no particular meaning and instead had a letter placed at the beginning indicating which note was represented. However, the lines indicating middle C and the F a fifth below slowly became most common. The completion of the four-line staff is usually credited to [[Guido of Arezzo|Guido d' Arezzo]] (c. 1000–1050), one of the most important musical theorists of the Middle Ages. It should be noted that the neumatic notational system, even in its fully developed state, did not clearly define any kind of rhythm for the singing of notes. Singers were expected to be able to improvise the rhythm, using established traditions and norms.

[[File:Head of Christ1.jpg|thumb|140 px|[[Musical notation]] from a Catholic [[Missal]], c.1310–1320]]
Instruments used to perform medieval music include the early flute, which was made of wood and which did not have any metal keys or pads. Flutes of this era could be made as a side-blown or end-blown instrument; the wooden [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and the related instrument called the [[gemshorn]]; and the [[pan flute]]. Medieval music used many plucked [[string instrument]]s like the [[lute]], [[Mandore (instrument)|mandore]], [[gittern]] and [[psaltery]]. The [[hammered dulcimer|dulcimers]], similar in structure to the [[psaltery]] and [[zither]], were originally plucked, but became struck by hammers in the 14th century after the arrival of new technology that made metal strings possible.

The bowed [[Byzantine lyra|lyra]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was the first recorded European bowed string instrument. The [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh|Ibn Khurradadhbih]] of the 9th century (d. 911) cited the [[Byzantine lyra]] as a bowed instrument equivalent to the Arab [[rabāb]] and typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the ''urghun'' (organ), ''shilyani'' (probably a type of [[harp]] or [[lyre]]) and the ''salandj'' (probably a [[bagpipe]]).&lt;ref name=Kartomi124&gt;{{harvnb|Kartomi|(1990)|p=124.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hurdy-gurdy]] was a mechanical violin using a rosined wooden wheel attached to a crank to "bow" its strings. Instruments without sound boxes like the [[jaw harp]] were also popular in the time. Early versions of the organ, [[fiddle]] (or [[vielle]]), and [[trombone]] (called the [[sackbut]]) existed in the medieval era.

===Renaissance===
The [[Renaissance music]] era (c. 1400 to 1600) saw the development of many new technologies that affected the performance and distribution of songs and musical pieces. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was laboriously hand-copied). The increased availability of printed sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger geographic area. One limiting factor to the wider dissemination of musical styles was that [[monk]]s, [[nuns]], [[aristocrat]]s and professional musicians and singers were among the few people who could read music.

Mechanical plate engraving was developed in the late sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Four Hundred Years of Music Printing|last = King|first = A. Hyatt|publisher = Trustees of the British Museum|year = 1968|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Engraving|plate engraving]] had been used since the early fifteenth century for creating visual art and maps, it was not applied to music until 1581.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this method, a mirror image of a complete page of music was engraved onto a metal plate. Ink was then applied to the grooves, and the music print was transferred onto paper. Metal plates could be stored and reused, which made this method an attractive option for music engravers. Copper was the initial metal of choice for early plates, but by the eighteenth century [[pewter]] became the standard material due to its malleability and lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Early American Music Engraving and Printing|last = Wolfe|first = Richard J.|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = Urbana, IL|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many instruments originated during the Renaissance. Some instruments used during the Renaissance were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously in the medieval era. Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals who were part of [[guild]]s, which kept playing techniques secret. Some of the more common brass instruments that were played included:

*[[Slide trumpet]]: Similar to the trombone of today except that instead of a section of the body sliding, only a small part of the body near the mouthpiece and the mouthpiece itself is stationary.
*[[Cornett]]: Made of wood and was played like the recorder, but blown like a trumpet.
*Trumpet: Early trumpets from the Renaissance era had no valves, and were limited to the tones present in the [[overtone series]]. This limited the types of melodies that Renaissance trumpets could play. They were also made in different sizes.
*[[Sackbut]]: A different name for the trombone, which replaced the slide trumpet by the middle of the 15th century

Stringed instruments included:
*[[Viol]]: This hollow, wooden stringed instrument, developed in the 15th century, commonly had six strings. It was usually played with a bow.
*[[Lyre]]: Its construction is similar to a small [[harp]], although instead of being plucked, it is strummed with a plectrum (or "pick"). Its strings varied in quantity from four, seven, and ten, depending on the era. It was played with the right hand, while the left hand silenced the notes that were not desired. Some newer lyres were modified to be played with a bow.
*[[Hurdy-gurdy]]: (Also known as the "wheel fiddle"), in which the strings are sounded by a wheel which the strings pass over. Its functionality can be compared to that of a mechanical violin, in that its bow (wheel) is turned by a crank. Its distinctive sound is mainly because of its "drone strings" which provide a constant pitch similar in their sound to that of bagpipes.
*[[Gittern]] and [[Mandore (instrument)|mandore]]: these instruments were used throughout Europe. They were the forerunners of modern plucked string instruments including the [[mandolin]] and acoustic guitar.

Percussion instruments included:
*[[Tambourine]]: The tambourine is a frame drum equipped with jingles that produce a sound when the drum is struck.
*[[Jew's harp]]: An instrument that produces sound using shapes of the mouth and attempting to pronounce different vowels with ones mouth.

Woodwind instruments included:

*[[Shawm]]: A typical shawm is keyless and about a foot long, with seven finger holes and a thumb hole. The pipes were commonly made of wood and more expensive models had carvings and decorations on them. It was the most popular [[double reed]] instrument of the Renaissance period; it was commonly used in the streets with drums and trumpets because of its brilliant, piercing, and often deafening sound. To play the shawm a person puts the entire reed in their mouth, puffs out their cheeks, and blows into the pipe whilst breathing through their nose.

[[File:Barocke Blockflöten.png|thumb|right|Renaissance recorders]]
*[[Reed pipe]]: Made from a single short length of cane with a mouthpiece, four or five finger holes, and reed fashioned from it. The reed is made by cutting out a small tongue, but leaving the base attached. It is the early predecessor of the saxophone and the clarinet.
*[[Hornpipe (musical instrument)|Hornpipe]]: Same as reed pipe but with a bell at the end.
*[[Bagpipe]]/Bladderpipe: It used a bag made out of sheep or goat skin that would provide air pressure for a pipe. When its player takes a breath, the player only needs to squeeze the bag tucked underneath their arm to continue the tone. The mouth pipe has a simple round piece of leather hinged on to the bag end of the pipe and acts like a non-return valve.  The reed is located inside the long metal mouthpiece, known as a bocal.
*[[Panpipe]]: Designed to have sixteen wooden tubes with a stopper at one end and open on the other. Each tube is a different size (thereby producing a different tone), giving it a range of an octave and a half. The player can then place their lips against the desired tube and blow across it.
*[[Transverse flute]]: The transverse flute is similar to the modern flute with a mouth hole near the stoppered end and finger holes along the body. The player blows in the side and holds the flute to the right side.
*[[Recorder (instrument)|Recorder]]: It uses a whistle mouth piece, which is a beak shaped mouth piece, as its main source of sound production. It is usually made of wood, with seven finger holes and a thumb hole.

===Baroque===
During the [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] (ca. 1600–1750), technologies for keyboard instruments developed, which led to improvements in the designs of [[pipe organ]]s and [[harpsichord]]s, and to the development of the first pianos. During the Baroque period, organ builders developed new types of pipes and reeds that created new tonal colors (timbres and sounds). Organ builders fashioned new stops that imitated various instruments, such as the [[viol|viola da gamba]] stop. The Baroque period is often thought of as organ building's "golden age," as virtually every important refinement to the instrument was brought to a peak. Builders such as [[Arp Schnitger]], Jasper Johannsen, [[Zacharias Hildebrandt]] and [[Gottfried Silbermann]] constructed instruments that displayed both exquisite craftsmanship and beautiful sound. These organs featured well-balanced mechanical key actions, giving the organist precise control over the pipe speech. Schnitger's organs featured particularly distinctive reed timbres and large [[Pedal keyboard|Pedal]] and Rückpositiv divisions.

Harpsichord builders in the [[Southern Netherlands]] built instruments with two keyboard (two manuals) which could be used for [[transposition (music)|transposition]]. These Flemish instruments served as the model for Baroque-era harpsichord construction in other nations.  In France, the double keyboards were adapted to control different choirs (groups) of strings, making a more musically flexible instrument (e.g., the upper manual could be set to a quiet lute stop, while the lower manual could be set to a stop with multiple string choirs, for a louder sound; this enabled the harpsichorist to have two dynamics and tone colours from one instrument). Another approach that could be used on a two manual harpischord would be to use a coupler to make one manual play two choirs of strings (e.g., an 8' set of strings and a 16' set of strings an octave lower), so that this manual could be used for a loud solo sound, and then having another manual set to trigger only one manual, creating an [[accompaniment]] volume. Instruments from the peak of the French tradition, by makers such as the [[Blanchet (harpsichord makers)|Blanchet family]] and [[Pascal Taskin]], are among the most widely admired of all harpsichords, and are frequently used as models for the construction of modern instruments.  In England, the [[Kirkman (harpsichord makers)|Kirkman]] and [[Burkat Shudi|Shudi]] firms produced sophisticated harpsichords of great power and sonority.  German builders extended the sound repertoire of the instrument by adding [[eight foot pitch|sixteen foot]] choirs, adding to the lower register and [[eight foot pitch|two-foot]] choirs, which added to the upper register.

The piano was invented during the Baroque era by the expert harpsichord maker [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]] (1655–1731) of [[Padua]], Italy, who was employed by [[Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany]]. Cristofori invented the piano at some point before 1700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erlich|first=Cyril|title=The Piano: A History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA; Revised edition|year=1990|isbn=0-19-816171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cris/hd_cris.htm |title=The Piano: The Pianofortes of Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655–1731) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=2003 | author=Powers, Wendy |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the clavichord allowed expressive control of volume and sustain, it was too quiet for large performances. The harpsichord produced a sufficiently loud sound, but offered little expressive control over each note. The piano offered the best of both, combining loudness with dynamic control.

Cristofori's great success was solving, with no prior example, the fundamental mechanical problem of piano design: the hammer must strike the string, but not remain in contact with it (as a tangent remains in contact with a clavichord string) because this would [[Damping|damp]] the sound. Moreover, the hammer must return to its rest position without bouncing violently, and it must be possible to repeat the same note rapidly. Cristofori's piano [[Action (piano)|action]] was a model for the many approaches to piano actions that followed. Cristofori's early instruments were much louder and had more [[sustain]] than the clavichord. The [[harpsichord]] continued to be used in performances during the first 50 years of the piano's existence; however, after 1750, the harpsichord was gradually phased out of orchestras and small music groups.

===Classicism===

From about 1790 onward, the Mozart-era piano underwent tremendous changes that led to the modern form of the instrument. This revolution was in response to a preference by composers and pianists for a more powerful, sustained piano sound, and made possible by the ongoing [[Industrial Revolution]] with resources such as high-quality steel [[piano wire]] for [[Strings (music)|strings]], and precision [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] for the production of [[Cast iron|iron frames]]. Over time, the tonal range of the piano was also increased from the five [[octave]]s of Mozart's day to the 7-plus range found on modern pianos.
Early technological progress owed much to the firm of [[Broadwood and Sons|Broadwood]]. [[John Broadwood]] joined with another Scot, Robert Stodart, and a Dutchman, [[Americus Backers]], to design a piano in the harpsichord case—the origin of the "grand". They achieved this in about 1777. They quickly gained a reputation for the splendour and powerful tone of their instruments, with Broadwood constructing ones that were progressively larger, louder, and more robustly constructed.

They sent pianos to both [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], and were the first firm to build pianos with a range of more than five octaves: five octaves and a [[Interval (music)|fifth (interval)]] during the 1790s, six octaves by 1810 (Beethoven used the extra notes in his later works), and seven octaves by 1820. The [[Vienna|Viennese]] makers similarly followed these trends; however the two schools used different piano actions: Broadwoods were more robust, Viennese instruments were more sensitive.

The [[cornet]], a piston-valved brass instrument related to the trumpet, could not have been developed without the improvement of [[piston valve]]s by [[Heinrich Stölzel]] and [[Friedrich Blühmel]]. In the early 19th century these two instrument makers almost simultaneously invented the valves still used today. [[Beethoven]]'s instrumentation for orchestra added [[piccolo]], [[contrabassoon]], and [[trombone]]s to the triumphal finale of his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]] (1804–1808). A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver effects of "storm" and "sunshine" in the composer's dramatic [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth Symphony]]. Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned percussion in his [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]] expanded the sound of the orchestra.

===Romanticism===
During the [[Romantic music]] era (c. 1810 to 1900), one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of [[sheet music]], which amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or in [[chamber music]] groups, such as [[string quartet]]s. Since mass-market sheet music was relatively inexpensive, this enabled composers and songwriters to distribute their songs and musical pieces to a larger audience and over a larger geographic area. While the widespread dissemination of sheet music helped to spread musical styles across a larger area, the impact was nevertheless restricted to the socioeconomic segments that could read music, [[sightsinging|sing melodies from sheet music]] and own pianos and other musical instruments–namely the middle class and the upper class. Individuals from lower socioeconomic segments were only indirectly able to benefit from this wider dissemination of musical styles (i.e., by hearing new songs performed by professional musicians in [[brothel]]s or [[tavern]]s), as poor people could typically not read music or own pianos or other expensive instruments.

New instruments such as the saxophone began to appear in some 19th-century orchestra scores. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example [[Maurice Ravel]]'s orchestration of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'', the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's ''[[Boléro]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)#Orchestral suites extracted from Romeo and Juliet|Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2]]. The [[euphonium]] was used in a few late Romantic and works, usually playing parts marked "tenor tuba", including [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]''. The [[Wagner tuba]], a modified member of the horn family, appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and several other works by Strauss, [[Béla Bartók]], and others; it has a prominent role in [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7 in E Major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagner-tuba.com/ |title=The Wagner Tuba |publisher=The Wagner Tuba |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornet]]s appear in [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La Mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]'', and several orchestral works by [[Hector Berlioz]].

The piano continued to undergo technological developments in the Romantic era, up until the 1860s. By the 1820s, the center of piano building innovation had shifted to Paris, where the [[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]] firm manufactured pianos used by [[Frédéric Chopin]] and the Érard firm manufactured those used by [[Franz Liszt]]. In 1821, [[Sébastien Érard]] invented the double escapement [[Action (piano)|action]], which incorporated a ''repetition lever'' (also called the ''balancier'') that permitted repeating a note even if the key had not yet risen to its maximum vertical position. This facilitated rapid playing of repeated notes, a musical device exploited by Liszt. When the invention became public, as revised by [[Henri Herz]], the double escapement action gradually became standard in grand pianos, and is still incorporated into all grand pianos currently produced.

Other improvements of the piano mechanism included the use of thick felt hammer coverings instead of layered leather or cotton. Felt, which was first introduced by [[Jean-Henri Pape]] in 1826, was a more consistent material, permitting wider dynamic ranges as hammer weights and string tension increased. The [[Sostenuto|sostenuto pedal]], invented in 1844 by [[Jean-Louis Boisselot]] and copied by the [[Steinway &amp; Sons|Steinway]] firm in 1874, allowed a wider range of effects.

One innovation that helped create the powerful, loud sound of the modern piano was the use of a strong iron frame. Also called the "plate", the iron frame sits atop the [[Sound board (music)|soundboard]], and serves as the primary bulwark against the force of string [[Tension (physics)|tension]] that can exceed 20 tons in a grand piano. The single-piece [[cast iron]] frame was patented in 1825 in [[Boston]] by [[Alpheus Babcock]],&lt;ref name="isacoff"&gt;Isacoff (2012, 74)&lt;/ref&gt; combining the metal hitch pin plate (1821, claimed by Broadwood on behalf of Samuel Hervé) and resisting bars (Thom and Allen, 1820, but also claimed by Broadwood and Érard). The increased structural integrity of the iron frame allowed the use of thicker, tenser, and more numerous strings, which further increased the strength of the instrument's tone. In 1834, the Webster &amp; Horsfal firm of [[Birmingham]] brought out a form of piano wire made from [[cast steel]]; according to Dolge it was "so superior to the iron wire that the English firm soon had a monopoly."&lt;ref name="Dolge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dolge|first1=Alfred |title=Pianos and Their Makers: A Comprehensive History of the Piano Volume 1|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=0486228568|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvYgWaXfcIYC&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important advances included changes to the way the piano is strung, such as the use of a "choir" of three strings rather than two for all but the lowest notes, which made the piano louder and the implementation of an over-strung scale, in which the strings are placed in two separate planes, each with its own [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] height. The mechanical action structure of the [[upright piano]] was invented in London, England in 1826 by [[Robert Wornum]], and upright models became the most popular model, also amplifying the sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmieri, ed.|first=Robert|title=Encyclopedia of keyboard instruments, Volume 2|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-93796-2|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upright pianos were more compact than grand pianos, and less expensive, so the invention of the upright piano helped make the piano an even more important instrument in private homes (for amateur music-making); in schools; in rehearsal halls; and in some types of performance venues.

The approximation of the [[square root of 2]] is four [[sexagesimal]] figures, which is about six [[decimal]] figures. 1 + 24/60 + 51/60&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 10/60&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.41421296...&lt;ref&gt;[http://it.stlawu.edu/%7Edmelvill/mesomath/tablets/YBC7289.html Photograph, illustration, and description of the ''root(2)'' tablet from the Yale Babylonian Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Numerical analysis''' is the study of [[algorithm]]s that use numerical [[approximation]] (as opposed to general [[symbolic computation|symbolic manipulations]]) for the problems of [[mathematical analysis]] (as distinguished from [[discrete mathematics]]). Numerical analysis naturally finds application in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, but in the 21st&amp;nbsp;century also the life sciences, social sciences, medicine, business and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations. As an aspect of mathematics and [[computer science]] that generates, analyzes, and implements algorithms, the growth in power and the revolution in computing has raised the use of realistic mathematical models in science and engineering, and complex numerical analysis is required to provide solutions to these more involved models of the world. [[Ordinary differential equation]]s appear in [[celestial mechanics]] (planets, stars and galaxies); [[numerical linear algebra]] is important for data analysis; [[stochastic differential equation]]s and [[Markov chain]]s are essential in simulating living cells for medicine and biology.

Before the advent of modern computers, [[numerical method]]s often depended on hand [[interpolation]] in large printed tables. Since the mid 20th century, computers calculate the required functions instead. These same interpolation formulas nevertheless continue to be used as part of the software algorithms for solving [[differential equation]]s.

One of the earliest mathematical writings is a Babylonian tablet from the [[Yale Babylonian Collection]] ([[YBC 7289]]), which gives a [[sexagesimal]] numerical approximation of the [[square root of 2]], the length of the [[diagonal]] in a [[unit square]]. Being able to compute the sides of a triangle (and hence, being able to compute [[square root]]s) is extremely important, for instance, in [[astronomy]], [[carpentry]] and [[construction]].&lt;ref&gt;The New Zealand Qualification authority specifically mentions this skill in document 13004 version 2, dated 17 October 2003 titled [http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/units/pdf/13004.pdf CARPENTRY THEORY: Demonstrate knowledge of setting out a building]&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerical analysis continues this long tradition of practical mathematical calculations. Much like the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian]] approximation of the square root of 2, modern numerical analysis does not seek exact answers, because exact answers are often impossible to obtain in practice. Instead, much of numerical analysis is concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds on errors.

==General introduction==
The overall goal of the field of numerical analysis is the design and analysis of techniques to give approximate but accurate solutions to hard problems, the variety of which is suggested by the following:

* Advanced numerical methods are essential in making [[numerical weather prediction]] feasible.
* Computing the trajectory of a spacecraft requires the accurate numerical solution of a system of [[ordinary differential equation]]s.
* Car companies can improve the crash safety of their vehicles by using computer simulations of car crashes. Such simulations essentially consist of solving [[partial differential equation]]s numerically.
* [[Hedge fund]]s (private investment funds) use tools from all fields of numerical analysis to attempt to calculate the value of stocks and derivatives more precisely than other market participants.
* Airlines use sophisticated optimization algorithms to decide ticket prices, airplane and crew assignments and fuel needs. Historically, such algorithms were developed within the overlapping field of [[operations research]].
* Insurance companies use numerical programs for [[Actuary|actuarial]] analysis.

The rest of this section outlines several important themes of numerical analysis.

===History===

The field of numerical analysis predates the invention of modern computers by many centuries. [[Linear interpolation]] was already in use more than 2000 years ago. Many great mathematicians of the past were preoccupied by numerical analysis, as is obvious from the names of important algorithms like [[Newton's method]], [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrange interpolation polynomial]], [[Gaussian elimination]], or [[Euler's method]].

To facilitate computations by hand, large books were produced with formulas and tables of data such as interpolation points and function coefficients.  Using these tables, often calculated out to 16 decimal places or more for some functions, one could look up values to plug into the formulas given and achieve very good numerical estimates of some functions.  The canonical work in the field is the [[NIST]] publication edited by [[Abramowitz and Stegun]], a 1000-plus page book of a very large number of commonly used formulas and functions and their values at many points.  The function values are no longer very useful when a computer is available, but the large listing of formulas can still be very handy.

The [[mechanical calculator]] was also developed as a tool for hand computation. These calculators evolved into electronic computers in the 1940s, and it was then found that these computers were also useful for administrative purposes. But the invention of the computer also influenced the field of numerical analysis, since now longer and more complicated calculations could be done.

===Direct and iterative methods===

{| class="wikitable" style="float: right; width: 250px; margin-left: 1em;"
 |-
 |
'''Direct vs iterative methods'''

Consider the problem of solving

:3''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 = 28

for the unknown quantity ''x''.

{| style="margin:auto; text-align:right"
 |+ Direct method
 |-
 |  || 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 = 28.
 |-
 | ''Subtract 4'' || 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 24.
 |-
 | ''Divide by 3'' || ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;nbsp;8.
 |-
 | ''Take cube roots'' || ''x'' = &amp;nbsp;2.
 |}

For the iterative method, apply the [[bisection method]] to ''f''(''x'') = 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 24. The initial values are ''a'' = 0, ''b'' = 3, ''f''(''a'') = &amp;minus;24, ''f''(''b'') = 57.

{| style="margin:auto;" class="wikitable"
 |+ Iterative method
 |-
 ! ''a'' !! ''b'' !! mid !! ''f''(mid)
 |-
 | 0 || 3 || 1.5 || &amp;minus;13.875
 |-
 | 1.5 || 3 || 2.25 || 10.17...
 |-
 | 1.5 || 2.25 || 1.875 || &amp;minus;4.22...
 |-
 | 1.875 || 2.25 || 2.0625 || 2.32...
 |}

We conclude from this table that the solution is between 1.875 and 2.0625. The algorithm might return any number in that range with an error less than 0.2.

==== Discretization and numerical integration ====

[[Image:Schumacher (Ferrari) in practice at USGP 2005.jpg|right|125px]]
In a two-hour race, we have measured the speed of the car at three instants and recorded them in the following table.

{| style="margin:auto;" class="wikitable"
! Time
| 0:20 || 1:00 || 1:40
|-
! km/h
| 140  || 150  || 180
|}

A '''discretization''' would be to say that the speed of the car was constant from 0:00 to 0:40, then from 0:40 to 1:20 and finally from 1:20 to 2:00. For instance, the total distance traveled in the first 40 minutes is approximately {{math|size=100%|1=({{val|2|/|3|u=h}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;{{val|140|u=km/h}})&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|93.3|u=km}}}}. This would allow us to estimate the total distance traveled as {{val|93.3|u=km}} + {{val|100|u=km}} + {{val|120|u=km}} = {{val|313.3|u=km}}, which is an example of '''numerical integration''' (see below) using a [[Riemann sum]], because displacement is the [[integral]] of velocity.

'''Ill-conditioned problem''': Take the function {{math|size=100%|1=''f''(''x'') = 1/(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)}}. Note that ''f''(1.1) = 10 and ''f''(1.001) = 1000: a change in ''x'' of less than 0.1 turns into a change in ''f''(''x'') of nearly 1000. Evaluating ''f''(''x'') near ''x'' = 1 is an ill-conditioned problem.

'''Well-conditioned problem''': By contrast, evaluating the same function {{math|size=100%|1=''f''(''x'') = 1/(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)}} near ''x'' = 10 is a well-conditioned problem. For instance, ''f''(10) = 1/9 ≈ 0.111 and ''f''(11) = 0.1: a modest change in ''x'' leads to a modest change in ''f''(''x'').
|}

Direct methods compute the solution to a problem in a finite number of steps. These methods would give the precise answer if they were performed in [[Computer numbering formats|infinite precision arithmetic]]. Examples include [[Gaussian elimination]], the [[QR decomposition|QR factorization]] method for solving [[system of linear equations|systems of linear equations]], and the [[simplex method]] of [[linear programming]]. In practice, [[Floating point|finite precision]] is used and the result is an approximation of the true solution (assuming [[Numerically stable|stability]]).

In contrast to direct methods, [[iterative method]]s are not expected to terminate in a finite number of steps. Starting from an initial guess, iterative methods form successive approximations that [[Limit of a sequence|converge]] to the exact solution only in the limit. A convergence test, often involving [[Residual (numerical analysis)|the residual]], is specified in order to decide when a sufficiently accurate solution has (hopefully) been found. Even using infinite precision arithmetic these methods would not reach the solution within a finite number of steps (in general). Examples include [[Newton's method]], the [[bisection method]], and [[Jacobi iteration]]. In computational matrix algebra, iterative methods are generally needed for large problems.

Iterative methods are more common than direct methods in numerical analysis. Some methods are direct in principle but are usually used as though they were not, e.g. [[GMRES]] and the [[conjugate gradient method]]. For these methods the number of steps needed to obtain the exact solution is so large that an approximation is accepted in the same manner as for an iterative method.

===Discretization===

Furthermore, continuous problems must sometimes be replaced by a discrete problem whose solution is known to approximate that of the continuous problem; this process is called ''[[discretization]]''. For example, the solution of a [[differential equation]] is a [[function (mathematics)|function]]. This function must be represented by a finite amount of data, for instance by its value at a finite number of points at its domain, even though this domain is a [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]].

==Generation and propagation of errors==
The study of errors forms an important part of numerical analysis. There are several ways in which error can be introduced in the solution of the problem.

===Round-off===

[[Round-off error]]s arise because it is impossible to represent all [[real number]]s exactly on a machine with finite memory (which is what all practical [[digital computer]]s are).

===Truncation and discretization error===

[[Truncation error]]s are committed when an iterative method is terminated or a mathematical procedure is approximated, and the approximate solution differs from the exact solution. Similarly, discretization induces a [[discretization error]] because the solution of the discrete problem does not coincide with the solution of the continuous problem. For instance, in the iteration in the sidebar to compute the solution of &lt;math&gt;3x^3+4=28&lt;/math&gt;, after 10 or so iterations, we conclude that the root is roughly 1.99 (for example). We therefore have a truncation error of 0.01.

Once an error is generated, it will generally propagate through the calculation. For instance, we have already noted that the operation + on a calculator (or a computer) is inexact. It follows that a calculation of the type {{tmath|a+b+c+d+e}} is even more inexact.

What does it mean when we say that the truncation error is created when we approximate a mathematical procedure?  We know that to integrate a function exactly requires one to find the sum of infinite trapezoids.  But numerically one can find the sum of only finite trapezoids, and hence the approximation of the mathematical procedure.  Similarly, to differentiate a function, the differential element approaches zero but numerically we can only choose a finite value of the differential element.

===Numerical stability and well-posed problems===

[[Numerical stability]] is an important notion in numerical analysis. An algorithm is called ''numerically stable'' if an error, whatever its cause, does not grow to be much larger during the calculation. This happens if the problem is ''[[condition number|well-conditioned]]'', meaning that the solution changes by only a small amount if the problem data are changed by a small amount. To the contrary, if a problem is ''ill-conditioned'', then any small error in the data will grow to be a large error.

Both the original problem and the algorithm used to solve that problem can be ''well-conditioned'' and/or ''ill-conditioned'', and any combination is possible.

So an algorithm that solves a well-conditioned problem may be either numerically stable or numerically unstable. An art of numerical analysis is to find a stable algorithm for solving a well-posed mathematical problem. For instance, computing the square root of 2 (which is roughly 1.41421) is a well-posed problem. Many algorithms solve this problem by starting with an initial approximation ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, for instance ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.4, and then computing improved guesses ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. One such method is the famous [[Babylonian method]], which is given by ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''/2 + 1/''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. Another method, which we will call Method X, is given by ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;This is a [[fixed point iteration]] for the equation &lt;math&gt;x=(x^2-2)^2+x=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, whose solutions include &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;. The iterates always move to the right since &lt;math&gt;f(x)\geq x&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;x_1=1.4&lt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; converges and &lt;math&gt;x_1=1.42&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; diverges.&lt;/ref&gt; We have calculated a few iterations of each scheme in table form below, with initial guesses ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.4 and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.42.

Observe that the Babylonian method converges quickly regardless of the initial guess, whereas Method X converges extremely slowly with initial guess ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.4 and diverges for initial guess ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.42. Hence, the Babylonian method is numerically stable, while Method X is numerically unstable.
:'''Numerical stability''' is affected by the number of the significant digits the machine keeps on, if we use a machine that keeps only the four most significant decimal digits, a good example on loss of significance is given by these two equivalent functions
:&lt;math&gt; 
f(x)=x\left(\sqrt{x+1}-\sqrt{x}\right)
\text{ and } g(x)=\frac{x}{\sqrt{x+1}+\sqrt{x}}.
&lt;/math&gt;
:If we compare the results of
:: &lt;math&gt; f(500)=500 \left(\sqrt{501}-\sqrt{500} \right)=500 \left(22.38-22.36 \right)=500(0.02)=10&lt;/math&gt;
:and
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{alignat}{3}g(500)&amp;=\frac{500}{\sqrt{501}+\sqrt{500}}\\
      &amp;=\frac{500}{22.38+22.36}\\
      &amp;=\frac{500}{44.74}=11.17
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;
: by looking to the two results above, we realize that '''[[loss of significance]]''' (caused here by '''catastrophic cancelation''') has a huge effect on the results, even though both functions are equivalent, as shown below
:: &lt;math&gt; \begin{alignat}{4}
f(x)&amp;=x \left(\sqrt{x+1}-\sqrt{x} \right)\\
    &amp;=x \left(\sqrt{x+1}-\sqrt{x} \right)\frac{\sqrt{x+1}+\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{x+1}+\sqrt{x}}\\
    &amp;=x\frac{(\sqrt{x+1})^2-(\sqrt{x})^2}{\sqrt{x+1}+\sqrt{x}}\\
    &amp;=x\frac{x+1-x}{\sqrt{x+1}+\sqrt{x}}  \\

    &amp;=\frac {x}{\sqrt{x+1}+\sqrt{x}}  \\
    &amp;=g(x)

==Areas of study==

The field of numerical analysis includes many sub-disciplines. Some of the major ones are:

===Computing values of functions===

{| class="wikitable" style="float: right; width: 250px; clear: right; margin-left: 1em;"
 |
'''Interpolation''': We have observed the temperature to vary from 20 degrees Celsius at 1:00 to 14 degrees at 3:00. A linear interpolation of this data would conclude that it was 17 degrees at 2:00 and 18.5 degrees at 1:30pm.

'''Extrapolation''': If the [[gross domestic product]] of a country has been growing an average of 5% per year and was 100 billion dollars last year, we might extrapolate that it will be 105 billion dollars this year.

[[Image:Linear-regression.svg|right|100px|A line through 20 points]]

'''Regression''': In linear regression, given ''n'' points, we compute a line that passes as close as possible to those ''n'' points.

[[Image:LemonadeJuly2006.JPG|right|100px|How much for a glass of lemonade?]]

'''Optimization''': Say you sell lemonade at a [[lemonade stand]], and notice that at $1, you can sell 197 glasses of lemonade per day, and that for each increase of $0.01, you will sell one glass of lemonade less per day. If you could charge $1.485, you would maximize your profit, but due to the constraint of having to charge a whole cent amount, charging $1.48 or $1.49 per glass will both yield the maximum income of $220.52 per day.

[[Image:Wind-particle.png|right|Wind direction in blue, true trajectory in black, Euler method in red.]]

'''Differential equation''': If you set up 100 fans to blow air from one end of the room to the other and then you drop a feather into the wind, what happens? The feather will follow the air currents, which may be very complex. One approximation is to measure the speed at which the air is blowing near the feather every second, and advance the simulated feather as if it were moving in a straight line at that same speed for one second, before measuring the wind speed again. This is called the [[Euler method]] for solving an ordinary differential equation.

One of the simplest problems is the evaluation of a function at a given point. The most straightforward approach, of just plugging in the number in the formula is sometimes not very efficient. For polynomials, a better approach is using the [[Horner scheme]], since it reduces the necessary number of multiplications and additions. Generally, it is important to estimate and control [[round-off error]]s arising from the use of [[floating point]] arithmetic.

===Interpolation, extrapolation, and regression===

[[Interpolation]] solves the following problem: given the value of some unknown function at a number of points, what value does that function have at some other point between the given points?

[[Extrapolation]] is very similar to interpolation, except that now we want to find the value of the unknown function at a point which is outside the given points.

[[Regression analysis|Regression]] is also similar, but it takes into account that the data is imprecise. Given some points, and a measurement of the value of some function at these points (with an error), we want to determine the unknown function. The [[numerical methods for linear least squares|least squares]]-method is one popular way to achieve this.

===Solving equations and systems of equations===

Another fundamental problem is computing the solution of some given equation. Two cases are commonly distinguished, depending on whether the equation is linear or not. For instance, the equation &lt;math&gt;2x+5=3&lt;/math&gt; is linear while &lt;math&gt;2x^2+5=3&lt;/math&gt; is not.

Much effort has been put in the development of methods for solving [[systems of linear equations]]. Standard direct methods, i.e., methods that use some [[matrix decomposition]] are [[Gaussian elimination]], [[LU decomposition]], [[Cholesky decomposition]] for [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] (or [[hermitian matrix|hermitian]]) and [[positive-definite matrix]], and [[QR decomposition]] for non-square matrices. [[Iterative method]]s such as the [[Jacobi method]], [[Gauss–Seidel method]], [[successive over-relaxation]] and [[conjugate gradient method]] are usually preferred for large systems. General iterative methods can be developed using a [[matrix splitting]].

[[Root-finding algorithm]]s are used to solve nonlinear equations (they are so named since a root of a function is an argument for which the function yields zero). If the function is [[derivative|differentiable]] and the derivative is known, then [[Newton's method]] is a popular choice. [[Linearization]] is another technique for solving nonlinear equations.

===Solving eigenvalue or singular value problems===
Several important problems can be phrased in terms of [[eigenvalue decomposition]]s or [[singular value decomposition]]s. For instance, the [[image compression|spectral image compression]] algorithm&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.redwoods.cc.ca.us/instruct/darnold/maw/single.htm The Singular Value Decomposition and Its Applications in Image Compression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004041704/http://online.redwoods.cc.ca.us/instruct/darnold/maw/single.htm |date=4 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the singular value decomposition. The corresponding tool in statistics is called [[principal component analysis]].

===Optimization===
{{Main|Mathematical optimization}}

Optimization problems ask for the point at which a given function is maximized (or minimized). Often, the point also has to satisfy some [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s.

The field of optimization is further split in several subfields, depending on the form of the objective function and the constraint. For instance, [[linear programming]] deals with the case that both the objective function and the constraints are linear. A famous method in linear programming is the [[simplex method]].

The method of [[Lagrange multipliers]] can be used to reduce optimization problems with constraints to unconstrained optimization problems.

===Evaluating integrals===
{{Main|Numerical integration}}

Numerical integration, in some instances also known as numerical [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]], asks for the value of a definite [[integral]]. Popular methods use one of the [[Newton–Cotes formulas]] (like the midpoint rule or [[Simpson's rule]]) or [[Gaussian quadrature]]. These methods rely on a "divide and conquer" strategy, whereby an integral on a relatively large set is broken down into integrals on smaller sets. In higher dimensions, where these methods become prohibitively expensive in terms of computational effort, one may use [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] or [[quasi-Monte Carlo method]]s (see [[Monte Carlo integration]]), or, in modestly large dimensions, the method of [[sparse grid]]s.

===Differential equations===
{{main|Numerical ordinary differential equations|Numerical partial differential equations}}

Numerical analysis is also concerned with computing (in an approximate way) the solution of [[differential equation]]s, both ordinary differential equations and [[partial differential equation]]s.

Partial differential equations are solved by first discretizing the equation, bringing it into a finite-dimensional subspace. This can be done by a [[finite element method]], a [[finite difference]] method, or (particularly in engineering) a [[finite volume method]]. The theoretical justification of these methods often involves theorems from [[functional analysis]]. This reduces the problem to the solution of an algebraic equation.

==Software==
{{main|List of numerical analysis software|Comparison of numerical analysis software}}

Since the late twentieth century, most algorithms are implemented in a variety of programming languages. The [[Netlib]] repository contains various collections of software routines for numerical problems, mostly in [[Fortran]] and [[C (programming language)|C]]. Commercial products implementing many different numerical algorithms include the [[IMSL Numerical Libraries|IMSL]] and [[Numerical Algorithms Group|NAG]] libraries; a [[free software|free-software]] alternative is the [[GNU Scientific Library]].

There are several popular numerical computing applications such as [[MATLAB]], [[TK Solver]], [[S-PLUS]], and [[IDL (programming language)|IDL]] as well as free and open source alternatives such as [[FreeMat]], [[Scilab]], [[GNU Octave]] (similar to Matlab), and [[IT++]] (a C++ library). There are also programming languages such as [[R (programming language)|R]] (similar to S-PLUS) and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] with libraries such as [[NumPy]], [[SciPy]] and [[SymPy]]. Performance varies widely: while vector and matrix operations are usually fast, scalar loops may vary in speed by more than an order of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciviews.org/benchmark/ Speed comparison of various number crunching packages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005024002/http://www.sciviews.org/benchmark/ |date=5 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificweb.com/ncrunch/ncrunch5.pdf Comparison of mathematical programs for data analysis] Stefan Steinhaus, ScientificWeb.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[computer algebra system]]s such as [[Mathematica]] also benefit from the availability of [[arbitrary precision arithmetic]] which can provide more accurate results.

Also, any [[spreadsheet]] [[software]] can be used to solve simple problems relating to numerical analysis.

[[File:DHR 787 at Siliguri Shed 05-02-18 19.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway]] Locomotive No.787 after conversion to oil firing.]]
An '''oil burner engine''' is a [[steam engine]] that uses [[Fuel oil|oil]] as its fuel. The term is usually applied to a [[locomotive]] or [[ship]] engine that burns oil to heat water, to produce the steam which drives the [[piston]]s, or [[steam turbine|turbine]]s, from which the power is derived.

This is mechanically very different from [[diesel engine]]s, which use [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]], although they are sometimes [[colloquially]] referred to as oil burners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spinelli|first1=Mike|title=Diesel on the Range: Land Rover Flagship to Come in Oil-Burner|url=http://jalopnik.com/176359/diesel-on-the-range-land-rover-flagship-to-come-in-oil-burner|accessdate=2017-09-08|work=[[Jalopnik]]|date=2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early pioneer of this form of engine was [[James Holden (engineer)|James Holden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Marine Fuels |author= Cletus H. Jones|year=1985|publisher=[[ASTM International]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0803104251&amp;id=I8se_2fK9R0C&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=%22Oil+Burner%22+ship&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;sig=MneYYV9yjekEI24_G0_vQT8xRGA|isbn=0-8031-0425-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Steam Locomotives Really Work|author= Alan J.

In James Holden's system, steam was raised by burning coal before the oil fuel was turned on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lner.info/co/GER/locomotives.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion==
Some oil-burning engines were originally designed to be coal powered but were converted. When a coal-burning steam locomotive is converted to burn oil, various modifications are usual:{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
# the grate is covered with broken [[firebrick]] to act as a reservoir of heat.  If the oil flame is blown out (e.g. by a downdraft when entering a tunnel) the hot firebrick will re-ignite it
# the lower part of the inner [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] is lined with firebrick
# shorter [[superheater]] elements are fitted

The latter two changes are needed because oil firing produces higher temperatures than coal firing, and can cause rapid erosion of metal.  For a similar reason, the [[smokebox]] is sometimes painted with silver-coloured heat-resisting paint.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

'''Parametric Stereo''' (PS) is lossy audio compression algorithm and a feature and an Audio Object Type (AOT) defined and used in [[MPEG-4 Part 3]] (MPEG-4 Audio) to further enhance efficiency in low bandwidth stereo media. [[Advanced Audio Coding]] Low Complexity (AAC LC) combined with [[Spectral band replication|Spectral Band Replication]] (SBR) and Parametric Stereo (PS) was defined as '''[[HE-AAC]] v2'''. An HE-AAC v1 decoder will only give mono sound when decoding an HE-AAC v2 bitstream. Parametric Stereo performs sparse coding in the spatial domain, somewhat similar to what SBR does in the frequency domain.
==AAC HE v2==
An AAC HE v2 bitstream is obtained by downmixing the stereo audio to mono at the encoder along with 2-3 kbit/s of side info (the Parametric Stereo information) in order to describe the spatial intensity stereo generation and ambience regeneration at the decoder.  By having the Parametric Stereo side info along with the mono audio stream, the decoder (player) can regenerate a faithful spatial approximation of the original stereo panorama at very low bitrates.

==One channel==
Because only one audio channel is transmitted, along with the parametric side info, a 24 kbit/s coded audio signal with Parametric Stereo will be substantially improved in quality, compared to a discretely stereo coded audio signal coded with conventional means. Thus, the additional bitrate spent on the single mono channel (combined with some PS side info) will improve the perceived quality substantially of the audio compared to a standard stereo stream at similar bitrate.
==Constraints==
However, this technique is only useful at the lowest bitrates (approx. 16 - 48 kbit/s) to give a good stereo impression, so while it can improve perceived quality at very low bitrates, it generally does not achieve [[Transparency (data compression)|transparency]], since simulating the stereo dynamics of the audio with the technique is limited and generally deteriorates perceived quality regardless of the bitrate.

'''Philip David Radford''' (born January 2, 1976) is an American environmental, clean energy and [[democracy]] leader&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Grist.org]]|url=http://15years.grist.org/|title=15 Years: Lessons Learned|accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; who served as the youngest executive director of [[Greenpeace]] USA.&lt;ref name="The National Journal"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[The National Journal]]|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/greenpeace-leader-moving-on-at-38-20140422 |title=Greenpeace Leader Moving On at 38; Phil Radford has been the youngest executive director in the environmental group's 43-year history, but he's looking for even greener pastures|accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the founder and President of Progressive Power Lab, an organization that incubates companies and non-profits that build capacity for progressive organizations, including the Progressive Multiplier Fund&lt;ref name="Progressive Multiplier Fund"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Progressive Multiplier Fund|url=https://progressivemultiplier.fund/|title=Progressive Multiplier Fund|accessdate=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Membership Drive.&lt;ref name="MembershipDrive"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=MembershipDrive |url=http://www.membershipdrive.com/team/|title=Our Team|accessdate=2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford is a co-founder of the [[Democracy Initiative]], was founder and executive director of Power Shift, and is a board member of the Mertz Gilmore Foundation.&lt;ref name="Mertz Gilmore Foundation"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Mertz Gilmore Foundation|url= http://www.mertzgilmore.org/index.php/about/board|title=Board of Directors |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a background in grassroots organizing, [[corporate social responsibility]],&lt;ref name="SustMeme CSR &amp; Business"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=McClelland Media Ltd. |url= https://www.leaderboarded.com/csr-business|title= SustMeme CSR &amp; Business |accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[climate change]], and [[clean energy]].&lt;ref name="SustMeme Climate Change and Energy"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=McClelland Media Ltd. |url= https://www.leaderboarded.com/climate-change-energy |title= SustMeme Climate Change and Energy|accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford lives in Washington, D.C. with his wife Eileen.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/fashion/weddings/eileen-simpson-philip-radford-weddings.html?_r=0 |title= Weddings, Celebrations |accessdate=2013-07-20 |date=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radford's [[theory of change]] shifted from viewing governments as arbitrators between public and private interests on environmental issues, to finding that most governments are captured by industry. Rather than fighting first for new laws, which could be blocked by industries, he has focused on pressuring large companies to change their practices and enlisted them as allies in pushing for strong environmental protections.&lt;ref name="CleanTechIQ"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= CleanTechIQ |url= http://cleantechiq.com/2013/01/activists-invade-the-boardroom/|title= What Greenpeace's New Strategy Means for Investors|accessdate =2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[Greenpeace]] campaigns that convinced [[Apple, Inc.]] and similar companies to shift to 100% clean energy and lobby utilities and regulators to make that possible,&lt;ref name="Greenpeace"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace USA]]|url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/media-center/news-releases/Greenpeace-Executive-Director-Philip-Radford-to-Step-Down/|title=Greenpeace Executive Director Philip Radford to Step Down; Leaves legacy of corporate victories and organizational growth|accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite AV media |publisher=[[Business Insider]]|url= http://www.businessinsider.com/greenpeace-fortune-500-deforestation-global-warming-2014-6 |title=How A 'Bunch Of Commies' Are Forcing The Fortune 500 To Stop Destroying Rain Forests, Killing Too Many Fish, And Burning Coal and Oil|accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as work to protect both the [[Indonesian rainforest]] and the [[Bering Sea Canyons]].&lt;ref name="Environmental Leader"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Environmental Leader|url= http://www.environmentalleader.com/2013/05/31/whole-foods-safeway-trader-joes-top-sustainable-seafood-list/|title=Whole Foods, Safeway, Trader Joe's Top Sustainable Seafood List| accessdate =2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work= [[Huffington Post]]|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/philip-radford/a-breakthrough-in-how-we_b_3423516.html | title= A Breakthrough in How We Work to Protect Our Oceans | accessdate =2013-09-02 |first=Philip |last=Radford |date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford argues that the combination of creating industry champions and "outside pressure" focused on the government are the keys to passing new laws to protect the environment.&lt;ref name="CleanTechIQ"/&gt; However, Radford has also been a vocal leader calling for the United States to pass [[campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance reform]] and respect all Americans' voting rights to shift power in politics from corporations towards people and fulfill "the promise of American democracy." Radford is considered by many to be a modern-day transcendentalist, in that he is very focused on nature and the environment, and he is an advocate of democracy.&lt;ref name="C-SPAN"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[C-SPAN]] |url= http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/ProgressiveAgenda |title= Progressive Agenda |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[Huffington Post]] |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/philip-radford/if-you-want-to-breathe-cl_b_3600018.html|title= If You Want to Breathe Clean Air, Senate Reform and Democracy Matter |accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Radford received his B.A. from [[Washington University]] in St. Louis in 1998.&lt;ref name="Washington University"/&gt;

== Early activism ==
Radford began his environmental activism as a high school student at [[Oak Park and River Forest High School]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]], a Chicago suburb, volunteering for an [[environmental justice]] campaign to stop the building of trash incinerators in the West Side of Chicago near his family's Oak Park home.&lt;ref name="Oak Park and River Forest High School Tradition of Excellence Past Award Recipients"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Oak Park and River Forest High School]] |url= http://www.oprfhs.org/alumni/Past-Award-Recipients-TOE.cfm|title=Oak Park and River Forest High School Tradition of Excellence Past Award Recipients |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first job as a grassroots organizer came as a canvasser for Illinois [[PIRG]]. While studying political science and business at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], he directed campaign and canvass offices during summers for the [[Fund for Public Interest Research]] for clients including the [[Human Rights Campaign]], [[PIRGIM]], and [[Ohio PIRG]] and worked part-time during school for the [[Sierra Club]].&lt;ref name="Fund for the Public Interest"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Fund for the Public Interest]] |url=http://www.fundforthepublicinterest.org/jobs/alumni/profiles/phillip-d.-radford |title=Phillip D. Radford, Greenpeace, Executive Director |accessdate=2013-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601223141/http://fundforthepublicinterest.org/jobs/alumni/profiles/phillip-d.-radford |archivedate=June 1, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating college in 1998, Radford became a lead organizer at [[Green Corps]], the field school for environmental organizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.greencorps.org/page/career-placement |title= Career Placement: Growing the Movement |publisher=[[Green Corps]] |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Field director of Ozone Action ===

From 1999 to 2001 Radford was field director for Ozone Action, an organization dedicated to working on the atmospheric threats of global warming and ozone depletion. As field director, Radford planned and executed a number of grassroots campaigns, including a campaign during the 2000 presidential primaries, which was the initial impetus for Senator John McCain sponsoring the Climate Stewardship Act.&lt;ref name="Canvassing Works"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Canvassing Works |url= http://www.canvassingworks.org/canvassingworks/2006/09/alumni_update_p.html |title= Canvassing Works |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Living on Earth"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Living on Earth]] |url= http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=07-P13-00049&amp;segmentID=3 |title= McCain on Climate Change |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radford also managed the grassroots mobilization for the Global Warming Divestiture Campaign, which resulted in [[Ford]], [[General Motors]], [[Texaco]], and other companies ending their funding the [[Global Climate Coalition]], which spread misinformation about global warming.&lt;ref name="Industry Ignored Its Scientists on Climate"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=

=== Founder of Power Shift ===

In 2001, Radford founded Power Shift,&lt;ref name="Fund for the Public Interest"/&gt; a [[non-governmental organization]] dedicated to driving [[clean energy]] market breakthroughs and building the [[grassroots]] base to stop [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="Power Shift"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Volunteermatch.org |url= http://www.volunteermatch.org/search/org22033.jsp|title=Power Shift|accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As executive director of Power Shift, Radford worked closely with the cities of San Diego, Chula Vista, and Berkeley, California, as well as nine other municipalities, to secure investments for installation of solar energy systems and implementation of energy efficiency measures in municipal buildings.&lt;ref name="Fund for the Public Interest"/&gt;  Radford also helped to convince [[Citigroup]] to adopt innovative new means of financing clean energy infrastructure for wind and solar installations that made them affordable to average Americans.&lt;ref name="The National Journal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[Environmental News Service]|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jan2004/2004-01-23-09.asp|title= Citigroup Sets New Environmental Standards |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leading Greenpeace USA ==

In 2009, at the age of 33, Radford was selected as the youngest ever executive director of [[Greenpeace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Grist.org]]|url= http://grist.org/climate-energy/greenpeace-out-parting-shots-from-a-battle-hardened-climate-leader/#.Uuj53o8Zxb0.twitter|title= Greenpeace out: Parting shots from a battle hardened climate leader |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[The Guardian]] |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/29/interview-greenpeace-phil-radford|title= Greenpeace USA's Phil Radford|accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford's tenure at Greenpeace USA is best known for convincing over 100 corporations to change their environmental practices;&lt;ref name="Paper Giant Pledges to Leave the Poor Rainforest Alone.

In September 2013, Radford announced that he would step down on April 30, 2014, once he had completed five years of service as executive director.&lt;ref name="The National Journal"/&gt;

[[New York Times]] reporter [[Andrew Revkin]] referred to a Greenpeace campaign during Radford's tenure as "Activism at Its Best."&lt;ref name="dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/activism-at-its-best-greenpeaces-push-to-stop-the-pulping-of-rain-forests/|title= Activism at Its Best: Greenpeace's Push to Stop the Pulping of Rain Forests|accessdate=2013-07-19|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Andrew C.|last=Revkin|date=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/a-chat-with-greenpeaces-departing-u-s-chief-on-old-and-new-environmentalism/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|title=A Chat With Greenpeace's Departing U.S. Chief on Old and New Environmentalism |accessdate=2014-04-19|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Andrew C. |last=Revkin |date=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Jealous]], former president and chief executive officer of the [[NAACP]] as well as co-founder of the [[Democracy Initiative]] with Radford, described Radford at the helm of Greenpeace as "a modern movement building giant.  He has built powerful diverse coalitions to bolster the fights for the environment and voting rights. In the process he has shown himself to be unmatched in mobilizing everyday people to fund their movements directly." Environmental leader [[Bill McKibben]] stated: "During Radford's tenure, Greenpeace has been helping the whole [[environmental movement]] shift back towards its roots: local, connected, tough."&lt;ref name="Greenpeace"/&gt;

Before becoming executive director of Greenpeace USA, Radford served as the director of the organization's [[Grassroots]] Program.&lt;ref name="Grist.org"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Grist.org]]|url= 
http://grist.org/article/2009-04-14-greenpeaces-new-leader-talks/|title= Greenpeace's new leader talks up need for a green grassroots|accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that capacity, he directed and significantly grew the organization's street canvass and launched and directed the door-to-door canvasses, online-to-offline organizing team, social media team, the Greenpeace Student Network, and the Greenpeace Semester.&lt;ref name="Greenpeace USA"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/about/our-staff/phil-radford/|title= Phil Radford|accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Radford, the street and door-to-door canvassing programs grew to include nearly 400 canvassers in almost 20 cities across the country and was responsible for doubling the organization's budget.&lt;ref name="Greenpeace USA"/&gt;

==Changing corporate behavior==

===Global Climate Coalition===
Radford managed the grassroots efforts of a national [[divestment]]/[[disinvestment]] campaign,&lt;ref name="Meet Philip Radford, Executive Director of Greenpeace"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[How Stuff Works]]|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/conservation/conservationists/changemaker-phil-radford.htm|title=Meet Philip Radford, Executive Director of Greenpeace|accessdate=2013-08-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109143521/http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/conservation/conservationists/changemaker-phil-radford.htm|archivedate=November 9, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which forced [[Ford]], [[General Motors]], [[Texaco]], and other companies to stop funding the [[Global Climate Coalition]], which spread misinformation about global warming.&lt;ref name="Industry Ignored Its Scientists on Climate"/&gt; Soon thereafter, the GCC ended operations.&lt;ref name="RIP: Global Climate Coalition; Global Climate Coalition Ends Its Work; Voice for Industry Opposed Global Treaty"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Heat is Online|url=

===Citigroup===
In 2001, while running Power Shift, Radford launched a campaign to push Citibank to offer and promote Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEMs).&lt;ref name="Last Call"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[In These Times]] |url=http://iatp.org/news/last-call | title= Last Call: In Person with Ben Winters, Save the Ales|accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citi was "missing the opportunity to help stop global warming by phasing out fossil fuel investments and promoting clean energy now," Radford said. "The irony is that if Citi financed solar for people's homes, solar energy could be made immediately affordable for millions of Americans today."&lt;ref name=" Multinational Monitor, April 2002 - VOLUME 23 - NUMBER 4"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Multinational Monitor]] |url=http://multinationalmonitor.org/mm2002/02april/april02corp1.html | title= Citigroup: Bankrupting Democracy; The Cost of Living Richly Citigroup's Global Finance and Threats to the Environment |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Citigroup agreed to offer and promote EEMs for residential wind, energy efficiency, and solar installations that would make clean energy affordable for millions of Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Environmental News Service]]|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jan2004/2004-01-23-09.asp| title= Citigroup Sets New Environmental Standards |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kimberly-Clark===
Radford oversaw the grassroots mobilization efforts on the [[Kleercut]] Campaign in the United States and, later, the entire U.S. component of the global campaign when he became Greenpeace's executive director,&lt;ref name="Grist.org"/&gt; targeting Kimberly-Clark for sourcing 22% of its paper pulp from Canadian [[Boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s containing 200-year-old trees. The campaign included intervening in Kleenex commercial shoots,&lt;ref name="Kleenex Gets Punk'd"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZCym0DB7hA |title=Kleenex Gets Punk'd|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; convincing twenty-two universities and colleges to take action such as cancelling contracts,&lt;ref name=" About the Student Network"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/getinvolved/get-involved/student-network/a-brief-history-of-the-greenpe/|title= 2005–2009 – Kleercut-Free Campuses and Victory!|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1718476/exclusive-how-kimberly-clark-ditched-its-forest-destroying-reputation-and-embraced-greenpeac|title= Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; recruiting 500 companies to boycott Kimberly-Clark,&lt;ref name="Forest Friendly 500"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url=http://forestfriendly500.org |title= Forest Friendly 500 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 1,000 protests of the company, and more.&lt;ref name=" Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" More Than Tissues in a Box of Kleenex"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2008-02-16/business/36867371_1_kleenex-kimberly-clark-greenpeace-office |title=More Than Tissues in a Box of Kleenex |accessdate=2013-08-23 |first=Ylan Q. |last=Mui |date=February 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203055353/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2008-02-16/business/36867371_1_kleenex-kimberly-clark-greenpeace-office |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The result: On August 5, 2009, Kimberly-Clark announced that it would source 40% of its paper fiber from recycled content or other sustainable sources – a 71% increase from 2007 levels. The demand created by Kimberly-Clark for sustainably logged fiber was greater than the supply, enabling the company to convince logging companies to change their practices.&lt;ref name=" Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Greenpeace and Kimberly-Clark Settle Feud"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/05/greenpeace-and-kimberly-clark-settle-feud/?_r=0 |title=Greenpeace and Kimberly-Clark Settle Feud|accessdate=2013-08-23 |first=Leslie |last=Kaufman |date=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia Pulp and Paper===
From 2010 to 2013, Radford managed Greenpeace US team that persuaded major U.S. companies to cancel their contracts with [[Asia Pulp and Paper]] (APP) – the world's third largest paper company&lt;ref name=" Paper Producer to Stop Clearing of Indonesian Forests"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/business/energy-environment/06iht-forest06.html?_r=0 |title=Paper Producer to Stop Clearing of Indonesian Forests |accessdate=2013-08-26 |first=Sara |last=Schonhardt |date=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; – to push APP to stop destroying ancient forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[GreenBiz]] |url= http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2014/05/06/annie-leonard-story-stuff-will-direct-greenpeace |title='Story of Stuff' creator Annie Leonard will lead Greenpeace USA |accessdate=2014-05-06 |date=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace and its allies succeeded in convincing more than 100 corporate customers of APP to sever their ties with the company,&lt;ref name="Paper Giant Pledges to Leave the Poor Rainforest Alone.

On February 5, 2013, Asia Pulp and Paper announced a deforestation policy protecting Indonesian rainforests.&lt;ref name=" Paper Giant Pledges to Leave the Poor Rainforest Alone. Finally"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |url= https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/02/asia-pulp-paper-greenpeace-indonesia-rainforest |title= Paper Giant Pledges to Leave the Poor Rainforest Alone.

===Apple, Facebook, and cloud computing go 100% clean energy===
On April 21, 2011, Greenpeace released a report highlighting data centers, which consumed up to 2% of all global electricity and this amount was projected to increase. Radford stated "we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today."&lt;ref name="Dirty Data Report Card"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2011/Cool%20IT/dirty-data-report-greenpeace.pdf|title=Dirty Data Report Card|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business Insider]] reported that after [[Greenpeace USA]] campaigns, "tech giants like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Salesforce have promised to power their data centers with renewable energy, a pledge that led Duke Energy, the nation's largest power utility and one of the most flagrant emitters of CO2, to begin providing clean energy to win their business."&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt;

===Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate Palmolive, palm oil and Indonesian rainforests===

In 2014, deforestation in Indonesia, which accounts for .1% of the world's surface, caused 4% of global warming pollution. One of the major drivers of deforestation was clearing the forest to grow palm oil plantations.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt; Under Radford, the Greenpeace USA team persuaded [[Procter &amp; Gamble]],&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt; [[Colgate Palmolive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |publisher=Monga Bay | url= http://news.mongabay.com/2014/0606-greenpeace-tiger-challenge.html |title=Greenpeace rates companies' zero deforestation commitments |accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mondelez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |publisher=Confectionery News | url= http://www.confectionerynews.com/Ingredients/Mondelez-announces-palm-oil-action-plan |title=Mondelez Announces Palm Oil Action Plan | accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other major companies to demand sustainably grown palm oil.

===Major U.S. supermarkets===
Under Radford, Greenpeace ran a campaign targeting supermarket chains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/news-and-blogs/campaign-blog/protecting-our-oceans-one-supermarket-at-a-ti/blog/34215/ | title= Protecting our oceans, one supermarket at a time | accessdate =2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; – which sell 50% of all seafood in the U.S. – to convince them to stop selling threatened fish, adopt sustainable seafood policies, and lobby for policies such as [[marine reserve]]s to protect the oceans. Some retailers simply moved from being scored in a report;&lt;ref name="Carting Away the Oceans 7"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/Global/usa/planet3/PDFs/oceans/CATO%20VII.pdf |title= Carting Away the Oceans 7 |accessdate= 2013-09-02 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131021051042/http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/Global/usa/planet3/PDFs/oceans/CATO%20VII.pdf |archivedate= October 21, 2013 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; others like [[Costco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work= [[The New York Times]] |url= http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/costco-pulls-threatened-fish-from-stores/?_r=0 | title= Costco Pulls Threatened Fish from Stores| accessdate =2013-09-02 |date=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Trader Joe's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Triple Pundit|url= http://www.triplepundit.com/2010/03/trader-joes-greenpeace/| title= Trader Joe's to Adopt Sustainable Seafood Policy After Greenpeace Campaign| accessdate =2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; required public campaigns to change them.

A '''plasmodiocarp''' is a special form of [[fruit body|fruit bodies]] of [[slime mould]]s. It is produced if the [[plasmodium (life cycle)|plasmodium]] concentrates during the [[fructification]] and pull back into the venetion of the plasmodium, from which the fruit body is created. The fruit body traces the process of the venetion, whereby the structure of its subsurface becomes plainly strand-shaped, branched, net or ring-shaped. The production of plasmodiocarps can be generic, or can be also caused by the deranged development of [[Sporocarp (fungi)|sporocarp]]s or [[Aethalium|aethalia]].&lt;ref&gt;(in German) Heinrich Dörfelt, ''Wörterbuch der Mycologie'', volume 2, Spektrum, 2001, p.246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven L Stephenson; Stempen, Henry, ''Myxomycetes : a handbook of slime molds'', Timber Press, 200, p.165&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''regulatory capitalism''' suggests that the operation maintenance and development of the [[International political economy|global political economy]] increasingly depends on administrative rules outside the legislatures and the courts.

The general trend despite and beyond the process of [[liberalization]] is that of growth rather than decline of [[regulation]]. [[Deregulation]] may represent trends in some industries (notably finance), but more regulation is the general trend beyond that characterize modern and post-modern capitalism alike.&lt;ref&gt;[[Levi-Faur, David]], ''The Global Diffusion of Regulatory Capitalism'', The ANNALS of the [[American Academy of Political and Social Science]], March 2005, vol. 598, no. 1, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation in this interpretation is an instrument of organizations—states, business, civil and hybrid and is carried at all political arenas and levels.

The concept of regulatory capitalism serves as an alternative to concepts like [[financial capitalism]], [[welfare capitalism]], [[Casino Capitalism|casino capitalism]], [[developmental capitalism]], [[risk capitalism]], [[state capitalism]] and [[crony capitalism]] in an attempt to shed more light on capitalism as a polymorphous order.

The '''reliability theory of aging''' is an attempt to apply the principles of [[reliability theory]] to create a [[mathematical model]] of [[senescence]]. The theory was published in Russian by [[Leonid A. Gavrilov]] and Natalia S. Gavrilova as ''Biologiia prodolzhitelʹnosti zhizni'' in 1986, and in English translation as ''The Biology of Life Span: A Quantitative Approach'' in 1991.{{r|gav|rayl}}

One of the models suggested in the book is based on an analogy with the reliability theory. The underlying [[hypothesis]] is based on the (previously suggested) premise that humans are born in a highly defective state. This is then made worse by environmental and mutational damage; exceptionally high [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] due to the extremely high number of low-reliable components (e.., [[cell (biology)|cell]]s) allows the organism to survive for a while.{{r|ieee}}&lt;ref name=gg2001/&gt;

The theory suggests an explanation of two aging phenomena for higher organisms: the [[Gompertz law]] of exponential increase in mortality rates with age and the "late-life mortality plateau" (mortality deceleration compared to the Gompertz law at higher ages).&lt;ref name=gg2001&gt;Gavrilov, Gavrilova (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

The book criticizes a number of hypotheses known at the time, discusses drawbacks of the hypotheses put forth by the authors themselves, and concludes that regardless the suggested mathematical models, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown.&lt;ref&gt;"Conclusion" section of the book&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ronald William Prest Drever''' (26 October 1931 – 7 March 2017) was a Scottish experimental physicist. He was a professor emeritus at the [[California Institute of Technology]], co-founded the [[LIGO]] project, and was a co-inventor of the [[Pound–Drever–Hall technique]] for [[laser]] stabilisation, as well as the [[Hughes–Drever experiment]].   This work was instrumental in the [[First observation of gravitational waves|first detection]] of [[gravitational wave]]s in September 2015.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/12153127/British-scientist-who-played-key-role-in-gravitational-waves-research-is-suffering-from-dementia.html | title=British scientist who played key role in gravitational waves research is suffering from dementia | publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited | work=The Telegraph | date=12 February 2016 | accessdate=12 February 2016 | author=Knapton, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Gravitational Waves Exist: The Inside Story of How Scientists Finally Found Them|url = http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/gravitational-waves-exist-heres-how-scientists-finally-found-them|newspaper = [[The New Yorker]]|access-date = 2016-02-11|issn = 0028-792X|first = Nicola|last = Twilley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Abbott, B.P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102 |journal=[[Phys.

Drever died on 7 March 2017, aged 85,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39212305|title=Gravitational waves pioneer Ronald Drever dies|publisher=[[BBC]]|work=Jonathan Amos|date=8 March 2017|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; seven months before his colleagues [[Rainer Weiss]], [[Kip Thorne]], and [[Barry Barish]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their work on the observation of gravitational waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2017/press.html|title=Nobel Prize in Physics 2017 press release|publisher=nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally believed that he would have won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize]] in the place of [[Barry Barish]] had he not died before the [[Nobel Committee for Physics|Nobel Committee]] made their decision.

==Education==
Drever was educated at [[Glasgow Academy]] followed by [[University of Glasgow]] where he was awarded a bachelor's degree in 1953&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH26945&amp;type=P|title=The University of Glasgow Story: Ronald Drever|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205233911/http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH26945&amp;type=P|archivedate=2016-12-05|website=universitystory.gla.ac.uk|publisher=University of Glasgow|location=Glasgow|author=Anon|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a  [[PhD]] in 1959 for research on orbital electron capture using proportional counters.&lt;ref name=phd&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Ronald William Prest |last=Drever |title=Studies of orbital electron capture using proportional counters |publisher=University of Glasgow |date=1959 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/298416389 |oclc=298416389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and research==
After receiving his PhD from the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1959, Drever initiated the Glasgow project to detect gravitational waves in the sixties,&lt;ref name="JCG"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/11953833.Sir_John_Gunn_University_professor_who_specialised_in_science_research/?_r=0 | title=Gravitational Waves Detected, Confirming Einstein’s Theory | publisher=[[The Herald Scotland]]| work=The Herald Scotland | date=23 August 2002 | accessdate=28 December 2017 | author=Prof R G Moorhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which he established the University’s first dedicated gravitational wave research group in 1970.&lt;ref name="BEQ"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_566307_en.html?_r=0 | title=£500K BEQUEST MAKES SPLASH WITH GLASGOW GRAVITATIONAL WAVE SCIENTISTS | publisher=[[University of Glasgow]]| work=gla.ac.uk | date=28 December 2017 | accessdate=28 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same year Drever was recruited to form a gravitational wave program at [[Caltech]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-holes-einstein.html?_r=0 | title=Gravitational Waves Detected, Confirming Einstein’s Theory | publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]| work=New York Times | date=11 February 2016 | accessdate=12 February 2016 | author=OVERBYE, DENNIS , CORUM, JONATHAN  and DRAKEFORD, JASON}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 Drever left [[Glasgow]] to work full-time at [[Caltech]].&lt;ref name="BEX"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_566307_en.html?_r=0 | title=£500K BEQUEST MAKES SPLASH WITH GLASGOW GRAVITATIONAL WAVE SCIENTISTS | publisher=[[University of Glasgow]]| work=gla.ac.uk | date=28 December 2017 | accessdate=28 December 2017 | author=Prof R G Moorhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drever's contributions to the design and implementation of the LIGO interferometers were critically important to their ability to function in the extreme sensitivity realm required for detection of gravitational waves (10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; strain).

Drever's final work involved the development of magnetically levitated optical tables for seismic isolation of experimental apparatus.&lt;ref name="CIT"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/2076/1/AUGaipcp00.pdf | title= Measurements of Mechanical Q in Levitated Paramagnetic Crystals | publisher=Caltech|work=Amaldi Conference 2000 | date=2000 |author1=S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2790">[[Image:Hoyt_model.svg|right|thumb|400px|A basic version of the Sector model]]

The '''sector model''', also known as the '''Hoyt model''', is a model of urban [[land use]] proposed in 1939 by land economist [[Homer Hoyt]].&lt;ref name="Hoyt"&gt;Hoyt, H. (1939) ''The Structure and Growth of Residential Neighborhoods in American Cities'' Washington, Federal Housing Administration&lt;/ref&gt; It is a modification of the [[concentric zone model]] of [[city]] development. The benefits of the application of this model include the fact it allows for an outward progression of growth. As with all simple models of such complex phenomena, its validity is limited.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, P.J. (1962) "Calgary: A study in urban pattern", ''Economic Geography'', 38(4), pp.315-329&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application ==
This model applies to numerous British cities. Also, if it is turned 90 degrees counter-clockwise it fits the city of [[Mönchengladbach]] reasonably accurately. This may be because of the age of the cities when transportation was a key, as a general rule older cities follow the Hoyt model and more recent cities follow the Burgess (concentric zone) model.

==Limitations ==
The theory is based on early twentieth-century rail transport and does not make allowances for private cars that enable [[commuting]] from cheaper land outside city boundaries.&lt;ref name="Rodwin"&gt;Rodwin, L. (1950) "The Theory of Residential Growth and Structure", ''Appraisal Journal'', 18, pp.295-317&lt;/ref&gt;  This occurred in [[Calgary]] in the 1930s when many near-[[slums]] were established outside the city but close to the termini of the [[tram|street car]] lines.  These are now incorporated into the city boundary but are pockets of low cost housing in medium cost areas.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; The theory also does not take into account the new concepts of edge cities and boomburbs, which began to emerge in the 1980s, after the creation of the model. Since its creation, the traditional Central Business District has diminished in importance as many retail and office buildings have moved into the suburbs.
*Physical features - physical features may restrict or direct growth along certain wedges
*The growth of a sector can be limited by [[exurb|leapfrog]] land.
*the theory too lacks the idea based on land topography.

'''''Seeing Anthropology: Cultural Anthropology Through Film''''' by [[Karl G. Heider]] introduces [[cultural anthropology]] with the use of both text and [[audiovisual|audiovisual media]]. First published in 1997, the work uses the tools of the [[ethnographic film]] discipline to inform its audience of the various cultural anthropology topics.  Also, the text covers 14 different [[culture]]s in 17 chapters, which are also represented in 21 different short film clips ranging from two to twelve minutes.&lt;ref name=ehren&gt;

A '''sinus''' is a sac or cavity in any [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] or [[biological tissue|tissue]], or an abnormal cavity or passage caused by the destruction of tissue. In common usage, "sinus" usually refers to the [[paranasal sinus]]es, which are air cavities in the cranial bones, especially those near the [[Human nose|nose]] and connecting to it. Most individuals have four paired cavities located in the [[cranial bone]] or skull.

==Etymology==
''Sinus'' is  [[Latin]] for "bay", "pocket", "curve", or "bosom". In [[anatomy]], the term is used in various contexts.

The word "sinusitis" is used to indicate that one or more of the [[membrane]] linings found in the sinus cavities has become inflamed or infected. It is however distinct from a [[fistula]], which is a tract connecting two epithelial surfaces. If left untreated, infections occurring in the sinus cavities can affect the chest and lungs.

*** [[Medullary sinuses]] (space between the lymphatic cortex and efferent lymphatic drainage)

== Paranasal sinuses ==
{{Main|Paranasal sinuses}}
The four paired sinuses or air cavities can be referred to as:
*Ethmoid sinus cavities which are located between the eyes.
*Frontal sinus cavities which can be found above the eyes (more in the forehead region).
*Maxillary sinus cavities are located on either side of the nostrils (cheekbone areas).
*Sphenoid sinuses that are located behind the eyes and lie in the deeper recesses of the skull.

===Function===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
The presence of sinus cavities within the cranial bone (skull) is essential for the following reasons:
*Sinus cavities allow for voice resonance 
*They help filter and add moisture to any air that is inhaled through the nasal passages. On top of filtering and adding moisture to the air we inhale, they also help in the removal of unwanted particles from the sinus cavities.
* Sinus cavities lighten the overall weight of the skull.

===Sinusitis===
{{Main|Sinusitis}}
If one or more of the paired paranasal sinuses or air cavities becomes inflamed, it leads to an [[infection]] called [[sinusitis]].  The term "sinusitis" means an inflammation of one or more of the sinus cavities. This inflammation causes an increase in internal pressure within these areas.  The pressure is often experienced in the cheek area, eyes, nose, on one side of the head (temple areas), and can result in a severe headache.

When diagnosing a sinus infection, one can identify which sinus cavity the infection is located in by the term given to the cavity. Ethmoiditis refers to an infection in the ethmoid sinus cavity/ies, frontal sinusitis refers to an infection occurring in the frontal sinus cavity/ies, antritis is used to refer to an infection in the maxillary sinus cavity/ies whilst spenoiditis refers to an infection in the sphenoid sinus cavity/ies.

====Classification====
Sinusitis can be acute, chronic or recurrent.

*Acute: Any sinus infection which lasts for a maximum of three weeks can be referred to as acute sinusitis; with the affected individual displaying symptoms such as congestion, post nasal drip, halitosis, a runny nose as well as sinus pressure and pain in the affected areas.
*Chronic: This infection extends beyond the three-week period and if left untreated can persist for years. Certain causes of chronic sinusitis can be allergies that have been left untreated, bacterial or fungal infections within one or more of the sinus cavities or any allergic disorders which targets and increases the sensitivity of the [[mucous membrane]] linings which surround the sinus cavities and nasal passages. Symptoms of chronic sinusitis are debilitating headaches, green colored [[mucus]], severe nasal blockages or congestion and heavy pressure experienced in the cheek, forehead, temple and eye regions.
*Recurrent: This type of sinus infection is intermittent; a person usually experiences this type of infection numerous times throughout a year with period of complete relief being experienced for weeks or months in-between.

====Causes====
A sinus infection can have a number of causes. Untreated allergies are one of the main contributing factors to the development of sinus infections.  A person with a sinus infection often has nasal congestion with thick nasal secretions, fever, and cough (WebMD).  Patients can be treated by “reducing the swelling or inflammation in the nasal passages and sinuses, eliminating the infection, promoting drainage from the sinuses, and maintaining open sinuses” (WebMD).  Sinusitis can be treated with medications and can also be eliminated by surgery.

Another cause of sinus infections is a result of bacterial invasion within one or more of the sinus cavities.  Any bacteria that enter the nasal passages and sinus cavities through the air that is inhaled, are trapped by the mucus secreted by the mucous membranes surrounding these areas. These trapped particles can cause an irritation to these linings resulting in swelling and inflammation. “Bacteria that normally cause acute sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (WebMD). These microorganisms, along with Staphylococcus aureus and some anaerobes (bacteria that live without oxygen), are involved in chronic sinusitis. (WebMD)” Fungi can also cause chronic sinusitis.

Certain abnormalities or trauma related injuries to the nasal cavity can make it difficult for effective drainage of mucus from the sinus cavities. This mucus is then allowed to develop in these areas making the cavity an ideal area in which bacteria can both attach and thrive.

====Treatment outlook====
Sinusitis or sinus infections usually clear up if treated early and appropriately. Apart from complications, the outlook for acute bacterial sinusitis is good. People may develop chronic sinusitis or have recurrent attacks of acute sinusitis if they suffer with allergies or if they have any “structural or anatomical causes" which predispose them to developing sinus infections.

Viral sinus infections do not however respond well to conventional treatments such as antibiotics. When treating fungal sinusitis, an appropriate fungicide is usually administered.

'''Solidere s.a.l.''' is a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[société anonyme libanaise|joint-stock company]] in charge of [[urban planning|planning and redeveloping]] [[Beirut Central District]] following the conclusion, in 1990, of the devastating [[Lebanese Civil War]]. By agreement with the government, Solidere enjoys special powers of [[eminent domain]] as well as a limited regulatory authority codified in law, making the company a unique form of [[public-private partnership]].

Solidere was founded on 5 May 1994 under the authority of the Council of Development and Reconstruction and following the vision of then-[[Prime Minister of Lebanon|Prime Minister]] [[Rafik Hariri]]. Solidere was incorporated as a privately owned company listed on the stock exchange. The name stands for ''Société Libanaise pour le Développement et la Reconstruction du Centre-ville de Beyrouth'', [[French language|French]] for "The Lebanese Company for the Development and Reconstruction of Beirut Central District".

==Projects==
Solidere is widely credited as the most important force behind Beirut's reemergence, in recent years, as a bustling urban destination with a chance to earn back its prewar title of "Paris of the Middle East". Solidere's main functions are the supervision of the government-authorized reconstruction plan, financing and developing the [[infrastructure]], new construction and rehabilitation of war-torn structures, [[landscape architecture|urban landscaping]] and the management of property.&lt;ref name="YS"&gt;{{Cite book|edition=illustrated|publisher=Routledge| isbn=9780415411561|page=314|last=Elsheshtawy|first=Yasser|title=The evolving Arab city: tradition, modernity and urban development|series=Planning, history, and the environment series|accessdate=17 October 2009|year=2008|url= https://books.google.com/?id=BmsechJmz60C&amp;pg=PT97&amp;lpg=PT97&amp;dq=souk+al+tawileh#v=onepage&amp;q=tawileh&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solidere has worked to attract global retailers such as [[Virgin Megastores]] to Beirut Central District. Its most significant single project to date has been [[Beirut Souks]], a 100,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; retail center that was scheduled to open by 2008; it opened in 2009. Other projects that are central to the company's cultural strategy for the center are the [http://www.beirutexhibitioncenter.com/ Beirut Exhibition Center], add Saifi Village - Quartier des Arts, a residential neighbourhood with a high density of design shops and art galleries.

==Controversy and Challenges==

Solidere was founded after the government chose the framework of the public-private Real Estate Holding Company (REHCO) as the most viable option to reconstruct the central district, which was severely damaged and demolished, and emptied of its pre-war economic and demographic activity. Some research points out that the REHCO solution was the only viable option.&lt;ref&gt;Middle East Economic Consultants. Feasibility Study for Beirut Central District. Beirut. 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The practical nonexistence of a functional government after the war, and the near-impossibility to align all stakeholders, including property owners, into one unified and feasible vision, called for private resources to plan and execute a project of such scale and importance. Hariri's credibility as a business person and the speed and efficiency of submitting plans and investments models all played in favor of the REHCO model. It can be argued that without this large-scale intervention, the centre would have at best re-developed in a chaotic and uncoordinated manner, the way that other areas of the capital are experiencing.

The first axis of controversy relates to the mechanisms and masterplans of the reconstruction. Several opposition groups emerged to challenge the REHCO model and propose alternatives to it. Among those was a group of academics and urban planners who fueled a public debate about the goals and methods of reconstruction, especially the large-scale demolition and redesign, as outlined by an initial plan submitted by Dar Al Handassah. Other critical views saw the plan as disconnecting the centre from the rest of the city's fabric&lt;ref&gt;M. Davie. Discontinuités imposées au coeur de la ville: le project de reconstruction de Beyrouth. Edition
de la Maison des sciences de l'homme d'Aquitaine, Bordeaux, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and transforming it into an "island of modernity".&lt;ref&gt;Saree Makdisi, “Laying Claim to Beirut: Urban Narratives and Spatial Identity in the Age of Solidere,” Critical Inquiry 23/3 (1997), 661-705.&lt;/ref&gt; The contested plan was consequently changed, with the participation of some of the architects from the opposition groups to take into account some of the key points raised.

A modified plan emerged and was evaluated by the Engineer's Union, but it never approved by the public before being sent to government.

The second axis of controversy relates to the mechanism of property expropriation, deemed forced and enabled by Capital's pressure on the government and Hariri's influence as prime minister and the valuation of property, deemed inappropriately low. By law, the company had six months to secure the necessary cash subscriptions to balance out the land value. Were it not for that conservative valuation of land, the whole project would have collapsed when the government had no alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;H. Schmid.

==Finances==

{{Citations broken|section|date=November 2017}}
Its shares are listed on the Beirut Stock Exchange, and its [[Global Depository Receipt]]s trade on the London Stock Exchange. Its share price on the Beirut exchange has risen sharply in recent years, from about US$5 in early 2004 to a high of $39 in September 2008. Between 1995 and 2015, Solidere has approved more than $1B in dividends to its shareholders.

Solidere's 36,000 shareholders are mostly Lebanese , in addition to Arab nationals, banks, and Arab or international funds. There are two categories of shares: '''A''' held by previous property owners and '''B''' by new investors. Rafik Hariri's share in the company has been a controversial subject in the Lebanese political spectrum. Some rumors say that he owned a majority stake in Solidere before his assassination in 2005, and the Hariri family continues to be a principal shareholder today. However, the Hariri family rejected those rumors, saying that he owned only 6% of the company's shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2006/07/verbal_clashes.php|title=Verbal clashes|website= Ya Libnan|date= July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Solidere prohibits any shareholder from acquiring more than 10% of the company's capital, either directly or indirectly.{{citation needed| date= November 2017}}

A '''Tactical Engagement Simulation''' (TES) is a [[training]] system for using [[weapon]]s. [[Laser]] transmitters are used instead of bullets, larger rounds, or shorter-range guided weapons such as [[anti-tank missile]]s.  A laser transmitter is mounted on the weapon and aligned with the weapon's [[gun barrel|barrel]].  

[[Gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) is often used as the stimulated medium and this produces a wavelength of 904 nanometres, in the near infrared band outside the sensitivity of the human eye which is from about 400 to 700 nm (0.4 to 0.7 micrometres).  

In modern TES systems the laser transmission is coded so that in a [[field exercise]], individual weapons can be identified by exercise control (EXCON) and appropriate calculations made of gravity drop, [[warhead]] damage radius and so forth.  

Weapons as small as [[hand gun]]s can be part of a TES system as can larger weapons including [[tanks]] and large calibre guns.  In field exercises, the laser transmitters can trigger cartridge-based [[Weapon effects simulation]] (WES) devices mounted on potential targets such as tanks and other vehicles.  WES systems include [[pyrotechnic]] flash/bang and smoke devices that add realism to a field exercise.  

All these events are recorded on the exercise computer.  After-Action Review (AAR) can include comprehensive analysis of weapon firing, accuracy and warhead effects on the targets.  Such techniques have taken much speculation out of the assessment of field exercises and have resulted in more realistic training than used to be available other than by using (dangerous) live firing.

'''The Institute of World Politics''' ('''IWP''') is a [[graduate school]] of [[national security]], [[Military intelligence|intelligence]], and [[international relations|international affairs]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. It was founded in 1990 to develop leaders in the intelligence, [[national security]], and [[Diplomacy|diplomatic communities]], while teaching the ethical exercise of [[Power in international relations|statecraft]]. The curriculum exposes students to international realities, including history, political culture, current and potential threats, and the strategic role of ideas, values, and belief systems in world politics. It emphasizes various elements of statecraft, including: [[counterintelligence]]; [[counterpropaganda]]; [[economic warfare|economic statecraft]] and [[Military science|warfare]]; [[information operations]]; [[political warfare]]; strategic soft power; and [[public diplomacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2011/12/04/leaders-with-ginni-thomas-john-lenczowski-institute-of-world-politics/|title=Leaders with Ginni Thomas: John Lenczowski, Institute of World Politics|author=Ginni Thomas|date=4 December 2011|work=The Daily Caller}}&lt;/ref&gt; The faculty is composed almost entirely of senior scholar-practitioners from the relevant fields. IWP offers five [[Master of Arts]] degrees: M.A. in Statecraft and National Security Affairs, M.A. in Statecraft and International Affairs, M.A. in Strategic Intelligence Studies, M.A. in Strategic and International Studies (Professional), and Executive M.A. in National Security Affairs. It also offers Certificates of Graduate Study and continuing education courses.

==Founding and history==
IWP was founded in 1990 by [[John Lenczowski]], the former Director of European and [[the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Affairs]] at the [[United States National Security Council]] during the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration.&lt;ref name=humanevents&gt;Conservative Spotlight, "John Lenczowski's Institute of World Politics," ''Human Events'' Vol. 50 Issue 1 (1/14/1994): 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Lenczowski’s stated purpose for establishing the Institute was to develop a graduate school and curriculum that integrates “all the instruments of statecraft,” teaching students to apply them across the spectrum of conflict while remaining grounded in American [[United States Declaration of Independence|founding principles]] and the rule of [[public international law|international law]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenczowski, John (2011).

From 1991–2005, IWP maintained an affiliation with [[Boston University]].&lt;ref name=humanevents /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diplomatdc.wordpress.com/nssp/|title=NSSP|work=The DC World Affairs Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affiliation ended in 2006 as IWP attained independent and full accreditation by the [[Middle States Commission on Higher Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msche.org/institutions_view.asp?idinstitution=278|title=Middle States Commission on Higher Education|author=Info724 Ltd.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, IWP became one of 17 academic institutions that is qualified by the [[U.S. Army]] to host Senior Service Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/IPO/repository/SSC_Schools_%20Info_Catalog_AY12-13[1].pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International partners==
Qualifying students have the opportunity to participate in an intensive, four-week program of tutorials at the [[University of Oxford]] in England, as coordinated through the Washington International Studies Council.  Successful completion of the program counts toward four-credits of IWP coursework as a general elective. 
Study takes place on the campus of New College,   This unique program includes:
* An Oxford-themed seminar: weekly one-on-one tutorials with an Oxford don that include critique and discussion of student essays
* Access to various lectures by Oxford academics and leading figures in British politics
* The option to attend performances at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre (Stratford) and the Globe Theatre (London)
* Tours of museums in Oxford, London, and Cambridge.

==Students==
The 150 member student body is composed of approximately 65% recent graduates planning to pursue careers in national security, foreign policy, or intelligence; and about 35% mid-career professionals in those fields seeking additional knowledge and credentials.  Students have come to IWP from across the United States as well as approximately 60 countries, the United States armed forces, and United States Government.  Though many IWP students and professors hold security clearances, this is not a prerequisite for studying at IWP, as all coursework,  takes place at an unclassified level. A majority of IWP graduates gain employment in national security, foreign affairs, and intelligence agencies.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Campus==
The Institute of World Politics is located in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Its campus consists of two buildings, the Marlatt Mansion and Bently Hall, both of which contain classrooms and administrative offices. [[Donald E. Bently]] was a longtime Institute Board member and major financial supporter of The Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Philanthropist and entrepreneur Donald E. Bently honored at Reagan Ranch |url=https://www.iwp.edu/news_publications/detail/philanthropist-and-entrepreneur-donald-e-bently-honored-at-reagan-ranch |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bently Hall at the Institute is named for Bently, who purchased the Marlett Mansion and two other buildings that house the Institute campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Campus |url=https://www.iwp.edu/about/page/campus |website=www.iwp.edu |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute holds the private library of former [[CIA]] Director [[William Casey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwp.edu/student_services/page/welcome-to-the-institute-of-world-politics-library |title=Welcome to The Institute of World Politics Library » Current Students » The Institute of World Politics |publisher=Iwp.edu |date=2015-09-16 |accessdate=2016-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225173740/http://www.iwp.edu/student_services/page/welcome-to-the-institute-of-world-politics-library |archivedate=2016-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Security Council Foundation]] Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ascfusa.org/app/webroot/files/fckfiles/ASC%20Founders%20and%20Benefactors.pdf |title=The American Security Council Foundation |website=Ascfusa.org |accessdate=November 1, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041856/http://www.ascfusa.org/app/webroot/files/fckfiles/ASC%20Founders%20and%20Benefactors.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==

Don Bently purchased the Marlatt Mansion and two adjacent townhouses for the Institute. For the first 15 years, he rented the building to the Institute for $1.00 per year. He paid several million dollars to gut and completely renovate the townhouses and later donated them to the Institute. He also endowed the Donald E. Bently Chair of Political Economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IWP mourns the passing of longtime supporter Donald E. Bently |url=https://www.iwp.edu/news_publications/detail/iwp-mourns-the-passing-of-longtime-supporter-donald-e-bently |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute is a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit, tax-exempt educational institution, relying on private charitable donations and tuition. Tuition accounts for approximately 65% of annual operating expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwp.edu/docLib/20070808_IWP%2520Booklet%2520Back%2520Half.pdf |title=IPW Booklet |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526070640/http://www.iwp.edu/docLib/20070808_IWP%20Booklet%20Back%20Half.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UCMSA Universalis''' is a multicultural and multidisciplinary student association directly affiliated with the [[University College Maastricht]]. It is run by UCM students for UCM students and contributes to both academic and social life at UCM. The association is involved in the organisation of debates, poetry readings, open-mic nights, parties, charity fundraisers, student representation, and other events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Schools/UCM/TargetGroup/ProspectiveStudents1/EducationalProfile/TheAcademicCommunity.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205021009/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Schools/UCM/TargetGroup/ProspectiveStudents1/EducationalProfile/TheAcademicCommunity.htm |archivedate=2010-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a structure typical of [[Maastricht University]] ''study associations,'' it is run by a student board. The Universalis student board consists of a Social Board, an Academic Council, and an Independent Body. Board positions are traditionally a semester to two semesters long. Active members of the association are organised as committees which provide services for all students at the college. All new students automatically become a member upon enrollment at the college. 

== Organisation structure ==
There are currently six members on the UCMSA Universalis Social Board: President, Treasurer, Secretary, External Executive, Social Executive, and Acquisitions Executive.  Currently only the President is elected by Universalis members, the rest of the Board are selected by the previous Board and then officialised through a public vote in a General Assembly.  Board members serve for one or two semesters after which they can re-apply.&lt;ref&gt;Pot, E.; Pagán, B. UCMSA Universalis Charter, Notarised 3 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Social Board meetings are held once a week.  Universalis's committees and societies operate under the Social Board, who seek to financially and logistically facilitate all committee activities.

The Academic Council works in parallel with the Study Association Board, with five members: Chair, Treasurer, Secretary, Events Coordinator, and External. The Council represents students in working with the [[University College Maastricht]]'s Board of Studies, who are responsible for evaluating academic courses and affairs. They also organize Academic conferences, guest speakers, academic workshops, and student exchanges with sister colleges. The Academic Council is funded by the Social Board, but works in conjunction with the Social Board.

The Independent Body consists of three to five students elected by a general assembly with the goal of keeping the Social Board and Academic Council in accordance with the association's Statutes and Policy Manual. They also serve a functional role in General Assemblies and voting procedures.

== History ==
At the beginning of September 2002 [[University College Maastricht|UCM]]'s first students gathered in the back yard of the newly founded college. Several students formed an informal ''founding committee'' to get a student society started.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, G.; Pot, E.; Pagán, B.; Wiebe, P.; Josten, L.; Plenter, J., UCM Study Association Universalis: Annual Report 2002-2003&lt;/ref&gt; Because the diversity of [[University College Maastricht|UCM]]'s students and its curriculum, they decided  that [[Leonardo da Vinci|Da Vinci]]'s [[Homo Universalis]] was a suitable symbol for the student society's identity. It represents the juxtaposition of different interests in its members and of the diverse [[University College Maastricht|UCM]] student body. The founding committee decided to call the association ''Universalis'' and Brian Pagán designed the logo, a stylised version of the [[Vitruvian Man]]. The first unofficial Universalis general meeting was held on 19 September 2002. The organisation's structure was drawn up by the founding committee and the first board was elected. The organisation was registered with the Maastricht [[Chamber of Commerce]] and certified by a [[Civil law notary|notary]] on 3 December 2002, marking the official establishment of UCM Study Association Universalis.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, G.; Pot, E.; Pagán, B.; Wiebe, P.; Josten, L.; Plenter, J., UCM Study Association Universalis: Annual Report 2002-2003&lt;/ref&gt;

UCMSA Universalis joined University College Student Representatives of the Netherlands (UCSRN) in &lt;year&gt; and has been an active member since.
