'''''AdvertCity''''' is a [[business simulation]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[VoxelStorm]].  The game was released on 17 April 2015 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[OS X]].&lt;ref name="advertcityreleased"&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connor|first1=Alice|title=Advertising For The Megacorps: AdvertCity Released|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/04/18/advertising-for-the-megacorps-advercity-released/|accessdate=4 July 2015|work=Rock Paper Shotgun}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The player takes on the role of an advertising magnate in a [[dystopian]] future city with a [[cyberpunk]] aesthetic.

The game has had a mixed reception, gathering predominantly positive reviews from players&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=User reviews: Mostly Positive (12 reviews)|url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/365800/reviews/|website=Steam Community|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=User reviews: Positive (43 reviews)|url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/365800/reviews/|website=Steam Community|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but moderate reviews in the press.&lt;ref name="gizoramareview" /&gt; At the time of writing, the game does not yet have a Metacritic score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No score yet based on 1 Critic Awaiting 3 more reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/advertcity|website=Metacritic|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:AdvertCity screenshot cyberspace.png|thumb|[[Megacorporations]] seen in the [[cyberspace]] view.]]
Gameplay in AdvertCity involves selling advertising to client [[megacorporations]]; the player does this by moving around the city from a first person god-view perspective reminiscent of [[Black &amp; White (video game)|Black &amp; White]], selecting buildings and sites in [[cyberspace]] as targets for their advertising.  Advertising technologies are unlocked progressively depending on reputation with various megacorporations, and range from flyers to billboards and blimps.

A key mechanic in the game is the ability to switch between [[meatspace]] and [[cyberspace]] at any time,&lt;ref name="siliconera"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chris|first1=Priestman|title=Affect The Economy Of A Cyberpunk City With Advertisements In AdvertCity|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2015/05/10/affect-the-economy-of-a-cyberpunk-city-with-advertisements-in-advertcity/|accessdate=4 July 2015|work=Siliconera}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is required to perform different actions in each space and to orchestrate advertising effectively.

The goal of the game is to take over the city, and to do this the player must gain the trust of the various megacorporations they interact with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lambert|first1=Liam|title=Kickstarter of the Week: AdvertCity|url=http://www.gizorama.com/2014/preview/kickstarter-of-the-week-advertcity|accessdate=4 July 2015|work=Gizorama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has a [[roguelike]] save system&lt;ref name="siliconera" /&gt; to increase the level of challenge - there is only one savegame available, the player has no choice but to save their progress when exiting, and the player cannot reload to a previous state if they make a mistake.

==Development==
Development of the game began when an early version of the game was built in 7 days for the 2014 Cyberpunk Game Jam.&lt;ref name="rps1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Adam|title=Outpunned And Outgunned: AdvertCity|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/03/26/outpunned-and-outgunned-advertcity/|accessdate=4 July 2015|work=Rock Paper Shotgun}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberpunk Game Jam|url=http://itch.io/jam/cyberpunk-jam|website=itch.io|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After receiving positive feedback during the jam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AdvertCity by VoxelStorm for Cyberpunk Jam - itch.io|url=http://itch.io/jam/cyberpunk-jam/rate/4287|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the developers decided to continue work on the game to create a full-scale release.&lt;ref name="pcgamesn2"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Fraser |title=AdvertCity, the cyberpunk tycoon sim, launches on Steam tomorrow |url=http://www.pcgamesn.com/advertcity/advertcity-the-cyberpunk-tycoon-sim-launches-on-steam-tomorrow |accessdate=4 July 2015 |work=PCGamesN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game sought [[crowdfunding]] via [[Kickstarter]] on 25 March 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AdvertCity by VoxelStorm — Kickstarter|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/voxelstorm/advertcity|website=Kickstarter|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was fully funded on the second day of the campaign, going on be overfunded by 373%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AdvertCity by VoxelStorm :: Kicktraq|url=http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/voxelstorm/advertcity/#chart-daily|website=Kicktraq|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its conclusion.

AdvertCity was submitted to [[Steam Greenlight]] during its Kickstarter in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steam Greenlight :: AdvertCity|url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=245157825|website=Steam Greenlight|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually greenlit after an unusually long delay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Christiansen|first1=Peter|title=&amp;#91;Update: Greenlit] Stuck In Greenlight Limbo: AdvertCity|url=http://wraithkal.info/stuck-in-greenlight-limbo-advertcity/|work=Wraithkal's Indie Gaming Corner}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2015.

AdvertCity entered a period of closed [[beta testing]] during development after its kickstarter; the final release was announced on 17 April 2015, and by June it had appeared on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and several other stores.&lt;ref name="advertcityreleased" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pcgamesn2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IndieGameStand Blog – Check out IndieGameStand’s new release,...|url=http://blog.indiegamestand.com/post/121145428790/check-out-indiegamestands-new-release|accessdate=4 July 2015|work=IndieGameStand Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedural city generation===
Every city in the game is [[procedural generation|procedurally generated]].&lt;ref name="rps1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pcgamesn" /&gt;

The procedural city layout is positioned on top of a [[Scenery generator|procedurally generated landscape]], which it conforms to and evolves around.  The developers considered using the industry standard Siggraph 2001 paper by Parish and Muller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Müller|first1=Pascal|last2=Parish|first2=Yoav I. H.|title=Procedural modeling of cities|journal=SIGGRAPH|date=2001|volume=01|pages=301–308|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=383292|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a basis, including the subsequent work on tensor fields,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Guoning|last2=Esch|first2=Gregory|last3=Wonka|first3=Peter|last4=Muller|first4=Pascal|last5=Zhang|first5=Eugene|title=Interactive Procedural Street Modeling|url=http://www.sci.utah.edu/~chengu/street_sig08/street_sig08.pdf|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rejected the use of [[L-system]]s on the grounds of their design being unsuited to cities, which ''"don't grow like branches on a tree"''.
&lt;ref name="facepunch"&gt;{{cite web|title=AdvertCity"Facebook Simulator 2014, but with more cyberpunk!"|url=http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1379594&amp;p=44356114&amp;viewfull=1#post44356114|website=Facepunch|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system instead uses:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...maps calculated on a mix of realtime procedural projection and cached data about population layouts and terrain features (such as different terrain types, gradients, altitudes, population densities, whether the region should be considered urban or rural etc); the result is something that has the subtlety of the tensor field system, yet generates much larger cities than are feasible with the L-system at a far higher speed than possible with that design. The AdvertCity generator is an object-oriented system of roads, junctions and buildings that can be adjusted on the fly to interact with their immediate surroundings, so roads meet and cross at specific junctions, branch and fork (something not used in the L system design), and can also spontaneously degenerate from paved roads to footpaths etc as appropriate, due to terrain or other aspects of the landscape. Different classes of road or path can also have entirely different rules and code for how they react to different terrain types and other features, so it's possible to build a much more dynamic overall city map with those."&lt;ref name="facepunch" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Procedural descriptions===
Every building in the city has a procedurally generated description; these vary in content but usually mention the architectural style of the building and some information about its history as well as factual info about its current owners and tenants in-game and its population.

All megacorporations are also described with text that is procedurally generated and updated during gameplay as their situation changes; this describes their standing in the city, their relationships with other megacorps, their financial status and their sentiments towards the player.

===Soundtrack===
AdvertCity's official soundtrack is a full-length score, unusual in that it is presented in two "sides", one for meatspace and one for cyberspace,&lt;ref name="bandcamp"&gt;{{cite web|title=AdvertCity OST|url=https://voxelstorm.bandcamp.com/album/advertcity-ost|website=Bandcamp|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with each track on each side having a beatmatched equivalent on the other; when the player switches between meatspace and cyberspace, the music smoothly crossfades between the two soundtracks.  A bespoke sound engine was developed for this purpose, with EBU R128 2011 support and HDR capability.&lt;ref name="steamstore" /&gt;

===Distribution===
The game is available on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[OS X]].

==Reception==
From its initial alpha launch, AdvertCity drew comment widely about its stark and "hyper-stylized" aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glass|first1=Garrett|title=Kickstarter Weekly: AdvertCity and Still Alive|url=http://thekoalition.com/2014/kickstarter-weekly-advertcity-still-alive|accessdate=4 July 2015|work=The Koalition}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics frequently praised the dark [[neo-noir]] cyberpunk aesthetic of the game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liles |first1=Nathaniel |title=Weekenders Sunday News 8/10 |url=http://cliqist.com/2014/08/10/weekenders-sunday-news-810/ |accessdate=31 May 2015 |work=Cliquist |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531060736/http://cliqist.com/2014/08/10/weekenders-sunday-news-810/ |archivedate=May 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twinfinite"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Chaz|title=AdvertCity Review|url=http://www.twinfinite.net/2015/07/03/advertcity-review/|website=Twinfinite|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as its tone,&lt;ref name="gizoramareview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lambert|first1=Liam|title=Swings and Roundabouts™ – AdvertCity Review|url=http://www.gizorama.com/2015/review/swings-and-roundabouts-advertcity-review|accessdate=4 July 2015|work=Gizorama}}&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to the vision of cyberspace as Gibson-inspired.  Stylistically, reviewers appreciated the dystopian bleakness of the vision of the future in the game, mentioning that your adverts are the only splashes of colour on the cold and uniform city,&lt;ref name="pcgamesn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Fraser|title=Drown a cyberpunk city in adverts with AdvertCity |url=http://www.pcgamesn.com/indie/drown-cyberpunk-city-adverts-advertcity|work=PCGamesN}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the surreal building-linked conception of cyberspace.&lt;ref name=twentydollargamingreview&gt;{{cite web|title=Twenty Dollar Gaming: Episode 2: AdvertCity|url=http://twentydollargaming.com/episode-2-advertcity/|website=Twenty Dollar Gaming|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reviewers also praised the dark and cynical sense of humour throughout the game.&lt;ref name="gizoramareview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="twentydollargamingreview" /&gt;
Reviewers also expressed interest in the Oculus Rift support which was included in the game from the alpha stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duncan|first1=Alasdair|title=AdvertCity is the cyberpunk tycoon game I didn't know I wanted|url=http://www.destructoid.com/advercity-is-the-cyberpunk-tycoon-game-i-didn-t-know-i-wanted-272439.phtml|work=Destructoid}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One common complaint is the high level of difficulty and steep learning curve at the start of the game.&lt;ref name="gizoramareview" /&gt;  Reviewers also cited the disorientating nature of the interface and immutable fast pace of the game as a negative.&lt;ref name="twinfinite" /&gt;  The developers cited games such as [[Dwarf Fortress]] as an inspiration, which is well known for its steep learning curve and difficult interface.&lt;ref name="twentydollargamingreview" /&gt;

The game also drew praise for its high-performing engine, which enables the game to run on previous-generation hardware;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hawkins|first1=Charlie|title=CyberPunk Advertisement Tycoon Game&amp;nbsp;Discovered- Altered Confusion™ The Place to Alter your Gaming Confusion|url=http://www.alteredconfusion.com/home/2014/3/25/cyberpunk-advertisement-tycoon-game-discovered.html#entry34715518|accessdate=4 July 2015|work=Altered Confusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; the minimum system requirements for CPU on Steam are stated simply as "Anything made since 2004"&lt;ref name="steamstore"&gt;{{cite web|title=AdvertCity on Steam|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/365800|website=Steam|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the game supports [[Windows XP]] despite Microsoft having discontinued support for that operating system before development of AdvertCity began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Businesses-urged-to-ditch-XP/tabid/412/articleID/293539/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ|title=Businesses urged to ditch XP|date=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics praised the "cyber-jazz"&lt;ref name="gizoramareview" /&gt; soundtrack's "[[postrock]], jazz &amp; glitch"&lt;ref name="siliconera" /&gt; qualities and praised the way it dovetails with the gameplay and "backs your every move"&lt;ref name="twinfinite" /&gt; in the game.

'''Albert''' is an electoral [[Constituencies of Belize|constituency]] in the [[Belize District]] of [[Belize]].  

==History==
The Albert constituency was created for the [[British Honduras general election, 1961|1961 general election]] as part of a major nationwide redistricting.  Albert is named after the principal street (Albert Street) within its jurisdiction.

Albert Constituency is home to the headquarters of most of Belize's banks, Belize City's major stores, The Supreme Court of Belize City, The Bliss Center for the Performing Arts, The Belize City House of Culture, Battlefield Park, the Belize City Commercial Center, and several government offices.

==Location and geographic setting==
Albert, often referred to locally as Albert Division, is located entirely within the boundaries of [[Belize City]], and is one of 10 constituencies in the [[Belize District]] that fall within its city limits. Albert is considered the downtown area of Belize City and is located on the eastern part of the city's southside.

Albert is bounded by the [[Caribbean Sea]] to the east and south, Haulover Creek to the north, and the constituencies of [[Mesopotamia (Belize House constituency)|Mesopotamia]] and [[Queen's Square (Belize House constituency)|Queen's Square]] to the west. The historic [[Swing Bridge (Belize)|Belize City Swing Bridge]], which crosses Haulover Creek, connects Albert with the [[Fort George (Belize House constituency)|Fort George]] constituency. Albert is Belize's smallest constituency in terms of area.

==Politics==
In an era in which the [[People's United Party]] overwhelmingly dominated Belizean national politics, [[Philip Goldson]] of the [[National Independence Party (Belize)|National Independence Party]] first won Albert in 1965. He held the seat as a member of the NIP, then the [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|UDP]] and finally the [[National Alliance for Belizean Rights|NABR]] until his retirement in 1998. Goldson was the sole opposition member in the Belize House during much of the 1960s and early 1970s. 

In 1998 [[Mark Espat]] won the constituency for the PUP for the first time in 37 years, defeating the UDP's Tom Morrison. Espat was re-elected by comfortable margins until his retirement in 2012.

Albert is currently represented in the [[House of Representatives of Belize]] by the UDP's Tracy Taegar- Panton, who is Minister of State with responsibility for Investment,Trade and Commerce.

Started May 2007. Currently in a Phase III trial for Stage IV [[Melanoma]].

MVax’s Phase II response rate of 35% (CR + PR) in combination with low-dose IL-2 compares favorably to the Phase II results of other melanoma cancer vaccines such as Vical’s Allovectin-7 (11% CR + PR)&lt;ref name="Allovectin-7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vical.com/products/cancer_therapies/allovectin-7.htm |title=Allovectin-7 Phase II data |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312044640/http://www.vical.com/products/cancer_therapies/allovectin-7.htm |archivedate=2010-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and BioVex’s OncoVex (28% CR + PR),&lt;ref name="OncoVex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biovex.com/downloads/ASCO_melanoma_poster_2009.pdf|title=OncoVex Phase II data}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are given as stand alone therapy.

Due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]] and recent cancer vaccine failures in other companies like Favrille and Cell Genesys, Avax has had trouble attracting investors. In an effort to conserve cash, enrollment for the Phase III trial was suspended on March 26, 2009,&lt;ref name="Suspension"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1015441/000114420409016249/v143945_8k.htm|title=Enrollment Suspension}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the trial itself is still ongoing. However on December 16, 2009, the company obtained bridge financing in the amount of $1,400,000. This will be used to conduct an interim analysis of the Phase III data for MVax. CEO John Prendergast notes: "Recent and anticipated news by companies involved with cancer vaccines and immunotherapies has resulted in renewed interest in the sector by institutional investors, larger pharma, biotechnology companies and the medical and scientific communities at large.".&lt;ref name="News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avax-tech.com/news/2009/09_1216.php |title=December 16, 2009 news |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501232847/http://www.avax-tech.com/news/2009/09_1216.php |archivedate=2013-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Union Royale Belge des Sociétés de Football Association ASBL v Jean-Marc Bosman''''' (1995) C-415/93 (known as the '''Bosman ruling''')&lt;ref&gt;[1995] ECR I-4921&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1995 [[European Court of Justice]] decision concerning [[freedom of movement for workers]], [[freedom of association]], and [[direct effect]] of article 39&lt;ref name="article39"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12002E039:EN:HTML|title=Article 39, Treaty Establishing the European Community|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Publications Office of the European Union|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615143740/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri%3DCELEX%3A12002E039%3AEN%3AHTML|archive-date=2008-06-15|dead-url=yes|accessdate=27 August 2008|work=EUR-Lex}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now article 45 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]) of the [[Treaty of Rome|TEC]]. The case was an important decision on the free movement of labour and had a profound effect on the transfers of footballers within the [[European Union]] (EU).

The decision banned restrictions on foreign EU players within national leagues and allowed players in the EU to move to another club at the end of a contract without a [[Free transfer (association football)|transfer fee]] being paid.

The ruling was made in a consolidation of three separate legal cases, all involving Belgian player [[Jean-Marc Bosman]]:
* ''[[Belgian Football Association]] v Jean-Marc Bosman''
* ''[[R.F.C. de Liège]] v Jean-Marc Bosman and others''
* ''[[UEFA]] v Jean-Marc Bosman''

==Facts==
[[Jean-Marc Bosman]] was a player for [[R.F.C. de Liège|RFC Liège]] in the [[Belgian First Division]] in Belgium whose contract had expired in 1990. He wanted to change teams and move to [[USL Dunkerque|Dunkerque]], a French club. However, Dunkerque refused to meet his Belgian club's transfer fee demand, so Liège refused to release Bosman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/who-is-jeanmarc-bosman-1602219.html|title=Who is Jean-Marc Bosman?|last=Burton|first=Mark|date=21 September 1995|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, Bosman's wages were reduced as he was no longer a first-team player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3480363/Jean-Marc-Bosmans-fight-against-depression-and-alcoholism.html|title=Jean-Marc Bosman's fight against depression and alcoholism|last=Phillips|first=Martin|date=21 March 2011|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took his case to the [[European Court of Justice]] in Luxembourg and sued for [[restraint of trade]], citing [[FIFA]]'s rules regarding football, specifically Article 17.

==Judgment==
On 15 December 1995, the court ruled the system, as it was constituted, placed a restriction on the free movement of workers and was prohibited by Article 39(1) of the [[Treaty of Rome|EC Treaty]] (now Article 45 (1) of the [[Treaty on the functioning of the European Union]]). Bosman and all other EU footballers were given the right to a [[free transfer (soccer)|free transfer]] at the expiration of their contracts, with the caveat they were transferring from a club within one EU association to a club within another EU association.

{{Cquote|94. The provisions of the Treaty relating to freedom of movement for persons are intended to facilitate the pursuit by Community citizens of occupational activities of all kinds throughout the Community, and preclude measures which might place Community citizens at a disadvantage when they wish to pursue an economic activity in the territory of another Member State (see Case 143/87 ''[[Stanton v INASTI]]'' [1988] ECR 3877, paragraph 13, and Case C-370/90 ''[[The Queen v Immigration Appeal Tribunal and Surinder Singh]]'' [1992] ECR I-4265, paragraph 16).

95. In that context, nationals of Member States have in particular the right, which they derive directly from the Treaty, to leave their country of origin to enter the territory of another Member State and reside there in order there to pursue an economic activity (see, inter alia, Case C-363/89 ''[[Roux v Belgium]]'' [1991] ECR I-273, paragraph 9, and Singh, cited above, paragraph 17).

96. Provisions which preclude or deter a national of a Member State from leaving his country of origin in order to exercise his right to freedom of movement therefore constitute an obstacle to that freedom even if they apply without regard to the nationality of the workers concerned (see also Case C-10/90 ''[[Masgio v Bundesknappschaft]]'' [1991] ECR I-1119, paragraphs 18 and 19).

97. The Court has also stated, in Case 81/87 ''[[R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury|The Queen v HM Treasury and Commissioners of Inland Revenue ex parte Daily Mail and General Trust plc]]'' [1988] ECR 5483, paragraph 16, that even though the Treaty provisions relating to freedom of establishment are directed mainly to ensuring that foreign nationals and companies are treated in the host Member State in the same way as nationals of that State, they also prohibit the Member State of origin from hindering the establishment in another Member State of one of its nationals or of a company incorporated under its legislation which comes within the definition contained in Article 58. The rights guaranteed by Article 52 et seq. of the Treaty would be rendered meaningless if the Member State of origin could prohibit undertakings from leaving in order to establish themselves in another Member State. The same considerations apply, in relation to Article 48 of the Treaty, with regard to rules which impede the freedom of movement of nationals of one Member State wishing to engage in gainful employment in another Member State.

98. It is true that the transfer rules in issue in the main proceedings apply also to transfers of players between clubs belonging to different national associations within the same Member State and that similar rules govern transfers between clubs belonging to the same national association.

99. However, as has been pointed out by Mr Bosman, by the Danish Government and by the Advocate General in points 209 and 210 of his Opinion, those rules are likely to restrict the freedom of movement of players who wish to pursue their activity in another Member State by preventing or deterring them from leaving the clubs to which they belong even after the expiry of their contracts of employment with those clubs.

100. Since they provide that a professional footballer may not pursue his activity with a new club established in another Member State unless it has paid his former club a transfer fee agreed upon between the two clubs or determined in accordance with the regulations of the sporting associations, the said rules constitute an obstacle to freedom of movement for workers.

101. As the national court has rightly pointed out, that finding is not affected by the fact that the transfer rules adopted by [[UEFA]] in 1990 stipulate that the business relationship between the two clubs is to exert no influence on the activity of the player, who is to be free to play for his new club. The new club must still pay the fee in issue, under pain of penalties which may include its being struck off for debt, which prevents it just as effectively from signing up a player from a club in another Member State without paying that fee.

102. Nor is that conclusion negated by the case-law of the Court cited by URBSFA and UEFA, to the effect that Article 30 of the Treaty does not apply to measures which restrict or prohibit certain selling arrangements so long as they apply to all relevant traders operating within the national territory and so long as they affect in the same manner, in law and in fact, the marketing of domestic products and of those from other Member States (see Joined Cases C-267/91 and C-268/91 ''[[Keck and Mithouard]]'' [1993] ECR I-6097, paragraph 16).

103. It is sufficient to note that, although the rules in issue in the main proceedings apply also to transfers between clubs belonging to different national associations within the same Member State and are similar to those governing transfers between clubs belonging to the same national association, they still directly affect players'access to the employment market in other Member States and are thus capable of impeding freedom of movement for workers. They cannot, thus, be deemed comparable to the rules on selling arrangements for goods which in Keck and Mithouard were held to fall outside the ambit of Article 30 of the Treaty (see also, with regard to freedom to provide services, Case C-384/93 ''[[Alpine Investments v Minister van Financiën]]'' [1995] ECR I-1141, paragraphs 36 to 38).

104. Consequently, the transfer rules constitute an obstacle to freedom of movement for workers prohibited in principle by Article 48 of the Treaty. It could only be otherwise if those rules pursued a legitimate aim compatible with the Treaty and were justified by pressing reasons of public interest. But even if that were so, application of those rules would still have to be such as to ensure achievement of the aim in question and not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose (see, inter alia, the judgment in ''[[Kraus]]'', cited above, paragraph 32, and Case C-55/94 ''[[Gebhard v Consiglio dell'Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano|Gebhard]]'' [1995] ECR I-0000, paragraph 37).}}

==Significance==
Prior to the Bosman ruling, professional clubs in some parts of Europe (but not, for example, in Spain and France) were able to prevent players from joining a club in another country even if their contracts had expired. In the United Kingdom, Transfer Tribunals had been in place since 1981 to resolve disputes over fees between clubs when transferring players at the end of their contracts. The Bosman ruling meant that players could move to a new club at the end of their contract without their old club receiving a fee. Players can now agree a pre-contract with another club for a free transfer if the players' contract with their existing club has six months or less remaining.

The Bosman ruling also prohibited domestic football leagues in EU member states, and also [[UEFA]], from imposing quotas on foreign players to the extent that they discriminated against nationals of EU states. At that time, many leagues placed quotas restricting the number of non-nationals allowed on member teams. Also, UEFA had a rule that prohibited teams in its competitions, namely the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], from naming more than three "foreign" players in their squads for any game. After the ruling, quotas could still be imposed, but could only be used to restrict the number of non-EU players on each team.

===Players===
Since the ruling came into effect throughout the EU in 1995, several notable players in European football have benefited from the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/297921.stm | title=Bosman summer holiday | publisher=BBC Sport | date=16 March 1999 | accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[Edgar Davids]] became Europe's first high-profile player to benefit from the ruling when he moved from [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. In 1999, [[Steve McManaman]] became the most lucrative transfer at the time in British football, as "Britain's first high-profile Bosman departure",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/fourfourtwoview/archive/2009/01/06/how-money-took-over-football-in-1879.aspx | title=How money took over football… in 1879 | publisher=FourFourTwo | date=6 January 2009 | accessdate=13 December 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107212633/http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/fourfourtwoview/archive/2009/01/06/how-money-took-over-football-in-1879.aspx | archivedate=7 January 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; when he moved from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and the deal resulted in McManaman becoming the highest paid British player in history, from 1999 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/mar/04/newsstory.sport | title=Our man in Madrid | publisher=Guardian News and Media|work=The Observer | first=Amy | last=Raphael | date=4 March 2001 | accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Davids and McManaman, scores of other notable players became able to negotiate deals according to their market value when their contracts expired, a trend that continued into the 2000s and beyond.

===Clubs===
The ruling meant that clubs could no longer block a move or demand a fee, from the player or from the destination club, if the player left at the end of their contracts.

The Bosman ruling coincided directly with a new era of financial gains in football. In 2005, UEFA declared it was seeking to repair aspects of the ruling because it was believed to be the cause of the increasing rich-poor gap between elite and smaller clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4528822.stm | title=Uefa to discuss Bosman drawbacks | publisher=BBC Sport | date=15 December 2005 | accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance in EU law==
Bosman confirmed the "rule of reason" approach of the courts used in the important [[Rewe-Zentral_AG_v_Bundesmonopolverwaltung_für_Branntwein|Cassis de Dijon]] case as not only suitable for issues relating to movement of goods within the EU, but also for cases concerning the free movement of workers.
 
If free movement is indistinctly applied (i.e. not just against foreign nationals) it could be justified if...
# The measures used were in pursuit of a legitimate aim
#That aim was justified by pressing reasons of public interest

The case also alludes to the fact that ''Alpine Investments v Minister van Financiën'' provides a similar test for services, and ''Gebhard v Consiglio dell'Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano'' for establishment.

===Other cases===
The Bosman ruling was considered and distinguished in ''Lehtonen'' (2000), a similar case which involved a deadline imposed by [[International Basketball Federation|FIBA]] after which basketball teams could not include players who had played for another team in the same season, where it was found that such a restriction was lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996J0176:EN:NOT| title=Judgment of the Court (Sixth Chamber) of 13 April 2000 – Jyri Lehtonen and Castors Canada Dry Namur-Braine ASBL v Fédération royale belge des sociétés de basket-ball ASBL (FRBSB)|work=EUR-Lex | publisher=Publications Office of the European Union | date=13 April 2000 | accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bread crumbs''' or '''breadcrumbs''' (regional variants: breading, crispies) are sliced residue of dry [[bread]], used for breading or crumbing foods, topping [[casserole]]s, [[stuffing]] [[poultry]], [[thickening]] [[stew]]s, adding inexpensive bulk to [[soups]], [[meatloaf|meatloaves]] and similar foods, and making a crisp and crunchy covering for fried foods, especially [[breaded cutlet]]s like [[tonkatsu]] and [[schnitzel]].  The [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] variety of bread crumbs is called ''panko''.

Dry breadcrumbs are made from dry breads which have been baked or toasted to remove most remaining moisture, and may have a sandy or even powdery texture.  Bread crumbs are most easily produced by pulverizing slices of bread in a [[food processor]], using a steel blade to make coarse crumbs, or a grating blade to make fine crumbs. A [[grater]] or similar tool will also do.

===Fresh breadcrumbs===
The breads used to make soft or fresh bread crumbs are not quite as dry, so the crumbs are larger and produce a softer coating, crust, or stuffing. The ''crumb'' of ''bread crumb'' also refers to the texture of the soft, inner part of a bread loaf, as distinguished from the crust, or "skin".

=== Panko ===
[[File:Baked panko crusted pork with pineapple sauce over udon.jpg|left|thumb|Baked ''panko'' crusted [[pork]] with [[pineapple]] sauce over [[udon]]]]
{{Nihongo|'''''Panko'''''|パン粉}} is a variety of flaky bread crumb used in [[Japanese cuisine]] as a crunchy coating for [[frying|fried]] foods, such as ''[[tonkatsu]]''. ''Panko'' is made from bread baked by electrical current, which yields a bread without a crust, and then grinding the bread to create fine slivers of crumb.&lt;ref name="UpperCrust"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNU9TrbiRk |title=Panko Bread Crumbs: The Secrets Revealed |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a crisper, airier texture than most types of breading found in [[European cuisine|Western cuisine]] and resists absorbing oil or grease when fried, resulting in a lighter coating.  Outside [[Japan]], its use is becoming more popular in both Asian and non-Asian dishes: It is often used on seafood and is often available in [[Asian supermarket|Asian markets]], speciality stores, and, increasingly, in many large [[supermarket]]s.

''Panko'' is produced worldwide, particularly in Asian countries, including Japan, [[Korea]], [[Thailand]], [[China]], and [[Vietnam]].



==== Etymology ====

The Japanese first learned to make bread from the Europeans. The word ''panko'' is derived from ''pan'', the Portuguese/Spanish/Japanese word for bread, and ''-ko'', a Japanese suffix indicating "[[flour]]", "coating", "crumb", or "powder" (as in ''komeko'', "rice powder", ''sobako'', "[[buckwheat]] flour", and ''komugiko'', "[[wheat]] flour").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marshall |first=Jo |url=http://www.heraldnews.com/lifestyle/food/x2084588983/COOKCABULARY-Panko-is-a-crumby-ingredient |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122002748/http://www.heraldnews.com/lifestyle/food/x2084588983/COOKCABULARY-Panko-is-a-crumby-ingredient |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-11-22 |title=COOKCABULARY: Panko is a crumby ingredient - Fall River, MA |publisher=The Herald News |date=2010-10-05 |accessdate=2012-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breading==
[[File:Breading.jpg|thumb|Cornmeal breading]]
'''Breading''' (also known as '''crumbing''') is a dry [[grain]]-derived [[food coating]] for a piece of food made from bread crumbs or a breading mixture with seasonings. Breading can also refer to the process of applying a bread-like coating to a food. Breading is well suited for [[frying]] as it lends itself to creating a crisp coating around the food. Breading mixtures can be made of breadcrumb, [[flour]], [[cornmeal]], and [[seasoning]] that the item to be breaded is dredged in before cooking. If the item to be breaded is too dry for the coating to stick, the item may first be moistened with [[buttermilk]], raw [[egg (food)|egg]], [[egg wash]] or other liquid.

Breading contrasts with [[batter (cooking)|batter]], which is a grain-based liquid coating for food that produces a smoother and finer texture, but which can be softer overall.

==In popular culture==
In the fairy tale [[Hansel and Gretel]], breadcrumbs were used by Hansel and Gretel to track their footpath. However, the bread crumbs were eventually eaten by birds, subsequently leading them to become lost in the woods. The popularity of breadcrumbs in the fairy tale lead to the inspiration the name "[[Breadcrumb (navigation)|breadcrumb]]" as a navigation element that allows users to keep track of their locations within programs or documents.&lt;ref name="Mark Levene"&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Search Engines and Web Navigation|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0470526842|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=mDI72_9-bw0C&amp;pg=PA221|author=Mark Levene|edition=2nd|page=221|date=18 October 2010|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11948">{{refimprove|date=November 2017}}[[British Bangladeshi]]s are people who arrived from [[Bangladesh]] to the United Kingdom, and throughout the years have started to create new businesses throughout the country, especially in [[Brick Lane]], where there are many [[Cuisine of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi restaurants]]. Bangladeshis were the first to have started the curry industry in the UK, from small businesses. The [[curry]] is now regarded as Britain's [[National dish]].{{ref?|date=November 2017}} Many others also own supermarket stores specialising in Bangladeshi products, and also in the media, the main Bengali channels - [[Bangla TV]] and [[Channel S]].

==Curry industry==
{{British Bangladeshi}}
Today many of the Bangladeshi community are now part of the [[Curry]] Industry in Britain, more than 8 out of 10 Indian restaurants in the UK are owned by Bangladeshis.{{ref?|date=November 2017}}  The number of restaurants owned by Bangladeshis increased rapidly years after years. In 1946, there were 20 restaurants or small cafes which were owned by Bengalis; then in 1960 there were 300 owned; and by 1980, more than 3,000 have been created by them. Now, as of today there are 8,500 Indian restaurants, of which around 7,200 are Bangladeshi.{{ref?|date=November 2017}}  One of the main dishes in those restaurants, the [[chicken tikka masala]], is now regarded as Britain's national food dish. The curry industry is seen as a great success for Bangladeshis living in Britain, the industry which changed the culture of food in [[British cuisine]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jun/21/religion.bangladesh |title=From Bangladesh to Brick Lane  |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2002-07-21 | location=London | first=Audrey | last=Gillan | date=2002-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forumstar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/forum/2007/june/bangladeshish.htm |title=Bangladeshis: Moving with the times |publisher=The Daily Star - FORUM |accessdate=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicken tikka masala is now served in restaurants around the globe, and a UK survey claimed it is the country's most popular restaurant dish.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;[[John Lloyd (writer)|Lloyd, J]] &amp; [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|Mitchinson, J]]: "[[The Book of General Ignorance]]". Faber &amp; Faber, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; One in seven curries sold in the UK is a chicken tikka. The popularity of the dish led the British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook to proclaim it as Britain's true national dish,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In quotes: Robin Cook|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4128320.stm |accessdate=2007-05-31 | work=BBC News | date=2005-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Robin Cook's chicken tikka masala speech|url=https://www.theguardian.com/race/story/0,,657407,00.html|accessdate=2007-05-31 | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=2001-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former prime minister, [[Tony Blair]] also recognised it as the favourite dish, by eating at a Bangladeshi curry restaurant for his daughter's birthday.{{ref?|date=November 2017}} 

===Curry threat===
In April 2008, restaurants owned by Bangladeshis came under threat. Many of those who work in these businesses are recent immigrants legally brought in from outside the UK. The British government announced it would change immigration laws for these workers, blocking access for high skilled chefs from Bangladesh. The law demanded these workers speak fluent English, and have good formal [[wikt:qualification|qualifications]] in order to meet the requirements of society and work in Britain.

These laws have not only affected the Bangladeshis, but have hit other migrant workers from China and India. However, the legislation may have a particularly dramatic effect on Bangladeshis because so many of them rely heavily on the curry business. It has been estimated that 30% of their restaurant businesses are seriously threatened by these new laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newburytoday.co.uk/News/Article.aspx?articleID=7070 |title=Curry houses under threat |publisher=Newbury Today |accessdate=2008-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627073212/http://www.newburytoday.co.uk/News/Article.aspx?articleID=7070 |archivedate=2008-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 April 2008, 44,000 people gathered and protested in London, including Bangladeshis, Chinese and Indians and other groups who were unhappy with the changes to the law. They argued their contribution to the [[economy of the United Kingdom]] meant they deserved better treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7356990.stm |title=Curry houses under threat |publisher=Restaurants in migrant protest |accessdate=2008-04-20 | date=2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local business==
Many other Bangladeshis own grocery stores. [[Whitechapel]] has a thriving local street market which is located opposite the famous [[Royal London Hospital]], which is the largest hospital in Britain. The market offers many low-priced goods for the people working in the area and the local [[Bengali people|Bengali]] community. People will go there to grab a bargain every day from Monday to Saturday, which contains over 80 stalls selling many products and foods, everything from fresh fruit to fish, clothing, bedding, carpets, jewellery and electrical goods such as toys. The nearby [[East London Mosque]] ensures a steady stream of visitors and many stalls now sell Indian [[spices]] and exotic vegetables as well as great quality silks and [[saree]] fabric.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.click4bricklane.co.uk/15.html |title=All About Brick Lane, London's Bangla Town - Whitechapel Market |publisher=click 4 brick lane |accessdate=2008-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511194657/http://www.click4bricklane.co.uk/15.html |archivedate=2008-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brick Lane, other than curry being served, there are many Bengali staples available such as [[jack fruit]], [[betel nut]] and [[paan|paan leaves]] and frozen fish caught from the [[Surma River]]. Various [[travel agents]] offer many flights to Sylhet with the national airline, [[Biman Bangladesh Airlines]], for around £500 and a new airline called, [[Air Sylhet]] was created by British Bangladeshi diaspora, offering low cost flights between both countries.&lt;ref name=air&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airsylhetonline.com/ |title=Air Sylhet |publisher=Air Sylhet PLC |accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Bangladeshi business located in the [[East End]] seems to hark back to the city of Sylhet, for example the weekly Sylheter Dak - which has a UK circulation of around 7,000 a week; a shop called Sylhet Stores; a lawyers' office called Sylhet &amp; Co; and a Bangladeshi Welfare Association. There are also booming black market in [[Payment system|money transfer]], such as [[First Solution Money Transfer]] which in June 2007, the company went into [[liquidation]] owing nearly £2 million to the public who used their services.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=solution&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6271686.stm |title=Millions lost as firm goes bust |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2007-07-04 | date=2007-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seamark and Ibco, owned by millionaire [[Iqbal Ahmed]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sovereignty.org.uk/siteinfo/newsround/prawnpawn.html UK's appetite for Prawns is Fed by Brutality Abroad - The Observer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908000000/http://www.sovereignty.org.uk/siteinfo/newsround/prawnpawn.html |date=September 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sea2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seamark.co.uk/history.php |title=Seamark Group - History |publisher=Seamark |accessdate=2008-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123203013/http://www.seamark.co.uk/history.php |archivedate=2007-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taj Stores,&lt;ref name=tajtimeout&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/shopping/features/3712.html |title=London's best food shops |publisher=Time Out Group Ltd |author=Jenni Muir and Charmaine Mok |date=23 October 2007 |accessdate=2008-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210235537/http://www.timeout.com/london/shopping/features/3712.html# |archive-date=2008-12-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; First Bangladeshi Real Estates in UK called [http://www.mashaestates.com Masha Estates Ltd] and many others.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; 
[[Image:Taj Stores.JPG|thumb|200px|The International, Bangladeshi grocery store, Taj Stores]]
There also hundreds of fast food stores scattered across east London, owned by Bangladeshis. Mainly named as [[Perfect Fried Chicken]] or [[Halal Fried Chicken]] and many other names. These fast food shops are primarily found in the area of [[Stepney Green]].

== Media ==
People have gone beyond by working in media, where the first Bangladeshi channel abroad was created called [[Bangla TV]] in 1999,&lt;ref name=banglatv&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banglatv.co.uk/ |title=Bangla TV |publisher=Bangla TV London |accessdate=2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later another channel called [[Channel S]] in 2004, 19th October 2017 another channel launched called [[ ION TV UK ]] to asian community' reflects on the programs it broadcasts, with many talk shows offering advice from lawyers and [[barristers]] such as 'Legal Advice', talk shows, Bengali film and entertainment, an Islamic voice for the community, and much of the channel is broadcast in the community language, Sylheti - the only Bangladeshi channel to do so.&lt;ref name=CS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chsuk.tv/ |title=Channel S, working for the community |publisher=Channel S |accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel S had acquired the rights to broadcast the [[Baishakhi Mela]], and there has been bitter rivalry between both channels. Also Bangla news published from London are Weekly Surma, Notun Din, Jonomot, [http://www.amaderprotidin.com daily Amader Protidin], Probasha Protidin, Potrica etc. Other notable business companies include, NRB Media, Masha Estates Ltd, Purple i - an IT expert company providing solutions to many restaurants,&lt;ref name=purple&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pit.uk.com/about_us.html |title=Purple-i - about us |publisher=Purple-i technologies |accessdate=2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First Solution Money Transfer ==
{{main|First Solution Money Transfer}}
In July 2007, a British-based firm called 'First Solution Money Transfer' went into [[liquidation]]. Company chairman, Dr Fazal Mahmood, admitted the business owed hundreds of thousands of pounds to the public. The firm claimed it had lost control of the money it handled due to a lack of regulation in this fast-growing sector of the economy.

The company was heavily used by the Bangladeshi community to send money to relatives in Bangladesh. However, huge amounts of this cash were lost. The scandal provoked anger amongst the community. Dr Mahmood received death threats and his home was pelted with eggs. Local leaders asked tough questions about the business's management, and the MP [[George Galloway]] raised the matter in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].  It eventually emerged that the company had lost an estimated 1.7 million pounds of public money.&lt;ref name=solution/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcfazal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/07/03/towerhamlets_transfer_video_feature.shtml |title=First Solution's Last Stand  |publisher=BBC, BBC London |accessdate=2007-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=await&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/moneybox/7087663.stm |title=Money Box - First Solution |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2007-11-10 | date=2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16527">'''Business process outsourcing''' ('''BPO''') is a subset of [[outsourcing]] that involves the [[contract|contracting]] of the operations and responsibilities of a specific [[business process]] to a third-party [[service provider]]. Originally, this was associated with [[manufacturing]] firms, such as [[Coca-Cola]] that outsourced large segments of its [[supply chain]].&lt;ref&gt;Tas, J. &amp; Sunder, S. 2004, ''Financial Services Business Process Outsourcing'', Communications of the ACM, Vol 47, No. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

BPO is typically categorized into [[back office]] outsourcing, which includes ''internal business functions'' such as [[human resources]] or [[finance]] and [[accounting]], and [[front office]] outsourcing, which includes ''customer-related services'' such as [[contact centre (business)|contact centre]] (customer care) services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work = Forbes |title = Getting A Piece Of Business Process Outsourcing |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2015/06/22/getting-a-piece-of-business-process-outsourcing/#12b9f2c56f90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BPO that is contracted outside a company's country is called [[offshore outsourcing]]. BPO that is contracted to a company's neighbouring (or nearby) country is called [[nearshoring|nearshore outsourcing]].

Often the business processes are [[information technology]]-based, and are referred to as '''ITES-BPO''', where ITES stands for Information Technology Enabled Service.&lt;ref name="NellisParker2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. G. Nellis|author2=David Parker|title=Principles of Business Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a8RFUZHfz2gC&amp;pg=PA213|year=2006|publisher=Financial Times Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-273-69306-2|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Knowledge process outsourcing]] (KPO) and [[legal process outsourcing]] (LPO) are some of the sub-segments of business process outsourcing industry.

==Benefits==
The main advantage of any BPO is the way in which it helps increase a company's flexibility. However, several sources{{Which|date=August 2009}} have different ways in which they perceive organizational flexibility. In early 2000s BPO was all about cost efficiency, which allowed a certain level of flexibility at the time. Due to technological advances and changes in the industry (specifically the move to more service-based rather than product-based contracts), companies who choose to outsource their back-office increasingly look for time flexibility and direct quality control.&lt;ref&gt;Sagoo, Anoop. [http://www.cio.co.uk/article/3378334/how-it-is-reinvigorating-business-process-outsourcing/ "How IT is reinvigorating business process outsourcing"] CIO. 6 Sep 2012. Retrieved 25 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Business process outsourcing enhances the flexibility of an organization in different ways:

Most services provided by BPO vendors are offered on a fee-for-service basis, using business models such as Remote In-Sourcing or similar software development and outsourcing models.&lt;ref&gt;BPM Watch. "In-Sourcing Remotely: A Closer Look at an Emerging Outsourcing Trend" {{cite web |url=http://www.bpmwatch.com/columns/in-sourcing-a-closer-look-at-an-emerging-outsourcing-trend/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303212216/http://www.bpmwatch.com/columns/in-sourcing-a-closer-look-at-an-emerging-outsourcing-trend/ |archivedate=2013-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cio-asia.com/mgmt/outsourcing/boundaries-between-it-outsourcing-and-bpo-are-becoming-blurred-ovum/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025113103/http://www.cio-asia.com/mgmt/outsourcing/boundaries-between-it-outsourcing-and-bpo-are-becoming-blurred-ovum/ |archive-date=2014-10-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can help a company to become more flexible by transforming fixed into [[variable costs]].&lt;ref&gt;Willcocks, L., Hindle, J., Feeny, D. &amp; Lacity, M. 2004, ''IT and Business Process Outsourcing: The Knowledge Potential'', Information Systems Management, Vol. 21, pp 7–15&lt;/ref&gt; A variable cost structure helps a company responding to changes in required capacity and does not require a company to invest in assets, thereby making the company more flexible.&lt;ref&gt;Gilley, K.M., Rasheed, A. 2000. ''Making More by Doing Less: An Analysis of Outsourcing and its Effects on Firm Performance.'' Journal of Management, 26 (4): 763-790.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way in which BPO contributes to a company’s flexibility is that a company is able to focus on its [[core competencies]], without being burdened by the demands of bureaucratic restraints.&lt;ref&gt;Kakabadse, A., Kakabadse. N. 2002. ''Trends in Outsourcing: Contrasting USA and Europe.'' European Management Journal Vol. 20, No. 2: 189–198&lt;/ref&gt; Key employees are herewith released from performing non-core or administrative processes and can invest more time and energy in building the firm’s core businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Weerakkody, Vishanth, Currie, L. Wendy and Ekanayake, Yamaya. 2003.  ''Re-engineering business processes through application service providers – challenges, issues and complexities.'' Business Process Management Journal Vol. 9 No. 6: 776-794&lt;/ref&gt; The key lies in knowing which of the main value drivers to focus on – customer intimacy, product leadership, or operational excellence. Focusing more on one of these drivers may help a company create a competitive edge.&lt;ref&gt;Leavy, B. 2004. ''Outsourcing strategies: opportunities and risk.'' Strategy and Leadership, 32 (6) : 20-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third way in which BPO increases organizational flexibility is by increasing the speed of business processes. Supply chain management with the effective use of supply chain partners and business process outsourcing increases the speed of several business processes, such as the throughout in the case of a manufacturing company.&lt;ref&gt;Tas, Jeroen, Sunder, Shyam. 2004. ''Financial Services Business Process Outsourcing.'' COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM Vol. 47, No. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, flexibility is seen as a stage in the organizational life cycle: A company can maintain growth goals while avoiding standard business bottlenecks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.strategy-business.com/press/16635507/11153 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408061144/http://www.strategy-business.com/press/16635507/11153 |archive-date=2008-04-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; BPO therefore allows firms to retain their entrepreneurial speed and agility, which they would otherwise sacrifice in order to become efficient as they expanded. It avoids a premature internal transition from its informal entrepreneurial phase to a more bureaucratic mode of operation.&lt;ref&gt;(Leavy 2004, 20-25)&lt;/ref&gt;

A company may be able to grow at a faster pace as it will be less constrained by large capital expenditures for people or equipment that may take years to amortize, may become outdated or turn out to be a poor match for the company over time.

Although the above-mentioned arguments favour the view that BPO increases the flexibility of organizations, management needs to be careful with the implementation of it as there are issues, which work against these advantages. Among problems, which arise in practice are: A failure to meet service levels, unclear contractual issues, changing requirements and unforeseen charges, and a dependence on the BPO which reduces flexibility. Consequently, these challenges need to be considered before a company decides to engage in business process outsourcing.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, Vaughan, Fitzgerald, Guy. 1997. ''The IT outsourcing market place: vendors and their selection.'' Journal of Information Technology 12: 223-237&lt;/ref&gt;

A further issue is that in many cases there is little that differentiates the BPO providers other than size. They often provide similar services, have similar geographic footprints, leverage similar technology stacks, and have similar Quality Improvement approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Adsit, D. (2009)  Will a Toyota Emerge from the Pack of Me-Too BPO's?, ''In Queue'' {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalcallcenters.org/pubs/In_Queue/vol3no21.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410035351/http://www.nationalcallcenters.org/pubs/In_Queue/vol3no21.html |archivedate=2009-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats==
Risk is the major drawback with business process outsourcing. Outsourcing of an information system, for example, can cause security risks both from a communication and from a privacy perspective. For example, security of North American or European company data is more difficult to maintain when accessed or controlled in other countries.{{fact|date=September 2016}} From a knowledge perspective, a changing attitude in employees, underestimation of running costs and the major risk of losing independence, outsourcing leads to a different relationship between an organization and its contractor.&lt;ref&gt;Bunmi Cynthia Adeleye, Fenio Annansingh and Miguel Baptista Nunes. "Risk management practices in IS outsourcing: an investigation into commercial banks in Nigeria", International Journal of Information Management 24 (2004): 167-180.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Altinkemer, A. Chaturvedi and R. Gulati. "Information systems outsourcing: Issues and evidence", International Journal of Information Management 14- 4 (1994): 252- 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Risks and threats of outsourcing must therefore be managed, to achieve any benefits. In order to manage outsourcing in a structured way, maximising positive outcome, minimising risks and avoiding any threats, a [[business continuity management]] (BCM) model is set up. BCM consists of a set of steps, to successfully identify, manage and control the business processes that are, or can be outsourced.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes Gibb, and Steven Buchanan. "A framework for business continuity management", International Journal of Information Management 26- 2 (2006): 128- 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Analytical hierarchy process''' [[analytic hierarchy process|(AHP)]] is a framework of BPO focused on identifying potential outsourceable information systems.&lt;ref&gt;Chyan Yang and Jen-Bor Huang. "A decision model for IS outsourcing", International Journal of Information Management 20- 3 (2000): 225- 239.&lt;/ref&gt; L. Willcocks, M. Lacity and G. Fitzgerald identify several contracting problems companies face, ranging from unclear contract formatting, to a lack of understanding of technical IT processes.&lt;ref&gt;L. Willcocks, M. Lacity and G. Fitzgerald. "Information technology outsourcing in Europe and the USA: Assessment issues", International Journal of Information Management 15- 5 (1995): 333- 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological pressures===
Industry analysts have identified [[robotic process automation]] (RPA) software as a potential threat to the industry&lt;ref name="HfSThreat"&gt;{{Citation|title=Robotic Automation Emerges as a Threat to Traditional Low Cost Outsourcing|publisher=HfS Research|url=http://www.hfsresearch.com/Robotic-Automation-as-Threat-to-Traditional-Low-Cost-Outsourcing|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921062911/http://www.hfsresearch.com/Robotic-Automation-as-Threat-to-Traditional-Low-Cost-Outsourcing|archivedate=2015-09-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GartnerPredicts2014"&gt;{{Citation|title=Gartner Predicts 2014: Business and IT Services Are Facing the End of Outsourcing as We Know It|publisher=Gartner|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2656215/predicts--business-it-services}}&lt;/ref&gt; and speculate as to the likely long term impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Visions of the Future: The Next Decade in BPO|publisher=Outsource Magazine|url=http://outsourcemagazine.co.uk/visions-of-the-future-the-next-decade-in-bpo/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413032822/http://outsourcemagazine.co.uk/visions-of-the-future-the-next-decade-in-bpo/|archivedate=2015-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the short term, however, there is likely to be little impact as existing contracts run their course: it is only reasonable to expect demand for cost efficiency and innovation to result in transformative changes at the point of contract renewals. With the average length of a BPO contract being 5 years or more&lt;ref name="GartnerLength"&gt;{{Citation|title=Market Trends: Outsourcing Contracts, Worldwide|publisher=Gartner|url=http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?ref=g_search&amp;id=490855}}&lt;/ref&gt; - and many contracts being longer - this hypothesis will take some time to play out.

On the other hand, an academic study&lt;ref name="LSEXchanging"&gt;{{Citation|title=Robotic  Process Automation at Xchanging|publisher=London School of Economics|url=http://www.xchanging.com/system/files/dedicated-downloads/robotic-process-automation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by the [[London School of Economics]] was at pains to counter the so-called "myth" that ''RPA will bring back many jobs from offshore''. One possible argument behind such an assertion is that new technology provides new opportunities for increased quality, reliability, scalability and cost control, thus enabling BPO providers to increasingly compete on an outcomes based model rather than competing on cost alone. With the core offering potentially changing from a "lift and shift" approach based on fixed costs to a more qualitative, service based and outcomes-based model, there is perhaps a new opportunity to grow the BPO industry with a new offering.

==Industry size==
One estimate of the worldwide BPO market from the BPO Services Global Industry Almanac 2017, puts the size of the industry in 2016 at about US$140 billion.&lt;ref name="almanac"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itproportal.com/features/the-battle-of-the-bpo-titans-eastern-europe-vs-india/|title=The battle of the BPO titans: Eastern Europe vs. India|author=|date=|website=itproportal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

India, China and the Philippines are major powerhouses in the industry. In 2017, in India the BPO industry generated US$30 billion in revenue according to the national industry association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/enterprise-services-and-applications/india-holds-its-global-edge-in-bpm-sector-with-28billion-revenue/54474665|title=India holds its global edge in BPM sector with $28billion revenue|website=ETCIO.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BPO industry is a small segment of the total outsourcing industry in India.

[[File:FEMA - 37677 - Aerial of a Louisiana oil refinary repaired since Katrina.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Oil refinery in [[Louisiana]] - an example of chemical industry]]
The '''chemical industry''' comprises the [[company|companies]] that produce industrial [[chemical]]s. Central to the modern [[world economy]], it converts [[raw materials]] ([[oil]], [[natural gas]], [[air]], [[water]], [[metals]], and [[minerals]]) into more than 70,000 different [[Products Finishing|products]].

The [[plastics industry]] contains some overlap, as most chemical companies produce plastic as well as other chemicals.

==History==
Although chemicals were made and used throughout history, the birth of the heavy chemical industry (production of chemicals in large quantities for a variety of uses) coincided with the beginnings of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in general.

===Industrial Revolution===
One of the first chemicals to be produced in large amounts through industrial processes was [[sulphuric acid]]. In 1736, the pharmacist [[Joshua Ward]] developed a process for its production that involved heating saltpeter, allowing the sulfur to oxidize and combine with water. It was the first practical production of sulphuric acid on a large scale. [[John Roebuck]] and [[Samuel Garbett]] were the first to establish a large-scale factory in [[Prestonpans|Prestonpans, Scotland]], in 1749, which used leaden condensing chambers for the manufacture of sulfuric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Derry, Thomas Kingston |author2=Williams, Trevor I. | year = 1993 | title = A Short History of Technology: From the Earliest Times to A.D. 1900 | location = New York | publisher = Dover }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sulfuric Acid: Pumping Up the Volume | author = Kiefer, David M. | year = 2001 | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/journals/tcaw/10/i09/html/09chemch.html | accessdate = 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StRolloxChemical 1831.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Tennant]]'s St. Rollox Chemical Works in 1831, then the biggest chemical enterprise in the world.]]
In the early [[18th century]], cloth was bleached by treating it with stale [[urine]] or [[sour milk]] and exposing it to [[sunlight]] for long periods of time, which created a severe bottleneck in production. Sulfuric acid began to be used as a more efficient agent as well as [[lime (material)|lime]] by the middle of the century, but it was the discovery of [[bleaching powder]] by [[Charles Tennant]] that spurred the creation of the first great chemical industrial enterprise. His powder was made by reacting [[chlorine]] with dry [[slaked lime]] and proved to be a cheap and successful product. He opened a factory in [[Glasgow St Rollox (UK Parliament constituency)|St Rollox]], north of [[Glasgow]], and production went from just 52 tons in 1799 to almost 10,000 tons just five years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Chemical Industries In The UK|publisher = American Chemical Society|url=http://the-environment.org.uk/bristish_isles/history_chemical_industry_UK.html|accessdate = 2013-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Soda ash]] was used since ancient times in the production of [[glass]], [[textile]], [[soap]], and [[paper]], and the source of the [[potash]] had traditionally been [[wood]] ashes in [[Western Europe]]. By the 18th century, this source was becoming uneconomical due to deforestation, and the [[French Academy of Sciences]] offered a prize of 2400 [[French livre|livres]] for a method to produce alkali from sea salt ([[sodium chloride]]). The [[Leblanc process]] was patented in 1791 by [[Nicolas Leblanc]] who then built a Leblanc plant at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]].&lt;ref name="Aftalion11"&gt;{{Cite book | first = Fred | last = Aftalion | title = A History of the International Chemical Industry | location = Philadelphia | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1991 | pages = 11–13 | isbn = 0-8122-1297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was denied his prize money because of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name='Aftalion14'/&gt;

However, it was in Britain that the Leblanc process really took off.&lt;ref name='Aftalion14'&gt;{{Cite book | first = Fred | last = Aftalion | title = A History of the International Chemical Industry | location = Philadelphia | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1991 | pages = 14–16 | isbn = 0-8122-1297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Losh]] built the first soda works in Britain at the [[Losh, Wilson and Bell]] works on the [[River Tyne]] in 1816, but it remained on a small scale due to large [[tariff]]s on salt production until 1824. When these tariffs were repealed, the British soda industry was able to rapidly expand. [[James Muspratt]]'s chemical works in [[Liverpool]] and Charles Tennant's complex near [[Glasgow]] became the largest chemical production centres anywhere. By the 1870s, the British soda output of 200,000 tons annually exceeded that of all other nations in the world combined.

[[File:Ernest Solvay.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Ernest Solvay]], patented an improved industrial method for the manufacture of [[soda ash]].]]
These huge factories began to produce a greater diversity of chemicals as the [[Industrial Revolution]] matured. Originally, large quantities of alkaline waste were vented into the environment from the production of soda, provoking one of the [[Alkali Act 1863|first pieces of environmental legislation]] to be passed in 1863. This provided for close inspection of the factories and imposed heavy fines on those exceeding the limits on pollution. Methods were soon devised to make useful byproducts from the alkali.

The [[Solvay process]] was developed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] industrial chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] in 1861. In 1864, Solvay and his brother Alfred constructed a plant in the Belgian town of [[Charleroi]] and in 1874, they expanded into a larger plant in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France. The new process proved more economical and less polluting than the Leblanc method, and its use spread. In the same year, [[Ludwig Mond]] visited Solvay to acquire the rights to use his process, and he and [[John Tomlinson Brunner|John Brunner]] formed the firm of [[Brunner Mond|Brunner, Mond &amp; Co.]], and built a Solvay plant at [[Winnington]], England. Mond was instrumental in making the Solvay process a commercial success; he made several refinements between 1873 and 1880 that removed byproducts that could slow or halt the mass production of sodium carbonate through use of the process.

===Expansion and maturation===
The late [[19th century]] saw an explosion in both the quantity of production and the variety of chemicals that were manufactured. Large chemical industries also took shape in Germany and later in the United States.

[[File:BASF Werk Ludwigshafen 1866.JPG|thumb|right|The factories of the German firm [[BASF]], in 1866.]]
Production of artificial manufactured [[fertilizer]] for [[agriculture]] was pioneered by Sir [[John Lawes]] at his purpose-built [[Rothamsted Research]] facility. In the 1840s he established large works near [[London]] for the manufacture of [[Monocalcium phosphate|superphosphate of lime]]. Processes for the [[vulcanization of rubber]] were patented by [[Charles Goodyear]] in the United States and [[Thomas Hancock (inventor)|Thomas Hancock]] in England in the 1840s. The first synthetic dye was discovered by [[William Henry Perkin]] in [[London]]. He partly transformed [[aniline]] into a crude mixture which, when extracted with alcohol, produced a substance with an intense purple colour. He also developed the first synthetic perfumes. However, it was German industry that quickly began to dominate the field of synthetic dyes. The three major firms [[BASF]], [[Bayer AG|Bayer]] and [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] produced several hundred different dyes, and by 1913, the German industry produced almost 90 percent of the world supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aftalion|1991|p=104}}, {{Harvnb|Chandler|2004|p=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[Herbert Henry Dow|Herbert Henry Dow's]] use of electrochemistry to produce chemicals from [[brine]] was a commercial success that helped to promote the country's chemical industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bromineproduction.html|title=Electrolytic Production of Bromine - National Historic Chemical Landmark - American Chemical Society|website=American Chemical Society|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[petrochemical]] industry can be traced back to the oil works of [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] in Scotland and [[Abraham Pineo Gesner]] in Canada. The first plastic was invented by [[Alexander Parkes]], an English [[metallurgy|metallurgist]]. In 1856, he patented [[Parkesine]], a [[celluloid]] based on [[nitrocellulose]] treated with a variety of solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=UK Patent office|title=Patents for inventions|year=1857|publisher=UK Patent office|pages=255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nCoU-2tAx8C&amp;pg=PA255}}&lt;/ref&gt; This material, exhibited at the 1862 London International Exhibition, anticipated many of the modern aesthetic and utility uses of plastics. The industrial production of [[soap]] from vegetable oils was started by [[William Lever]] and his brother [[James Darcy Lever|James]] in 1885 in [[Lancashire]] based on a modern chemical process invented by William Hough Watson that used [[glycerin]] and [[vegetable oil]]s.&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;Jeannifer Filly Sumayku, [http://www.thepresidentpost.com/?p=2621 Unilever: Providing Enjoyable and Meaningful Life to Customers], ''The President Post, 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1920s, chemical firms consolidated into large [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s; [[IG Farben]] in Germany, [[Rhône-Poulenc]] in France and [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] in Britain. [[DuPont|Dupont]] became a major chemicals firm in the early 20th century in America.

Currently chemical production is a high-tech industry, where the competitiveness is more based on capacity in investment on research and development than the labour cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first=Gabriele |last= Centi|title=Resources and energy efficiency :the winning strategy for chemical industry |journal=La Chimica  l'Industria |publisher=Società Chimica Italiana|url=https://www.soc.chim.it/sites/default/files/chimind/pdf/2012_1_64_ca.pdf|issue=  1|date = January 2012|pages=64–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Polymers and plastics, especially [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[polyethylene terephthalate]], [[polystyrene]] and [[polycarbonate]] comprise about 80% of the industry’s output worldwide".&lt;ref name=Chemistry&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemistry in Daily Life|last=Singh|first=Kirpal|publisher=PHI Learning Private Limited|isbn=978-81-203-4617-8|date=July 2012|page=132|chapter=17.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These materials are often converted to [[fluoropolymer]] tubing products and used by the industry to transport highly corrosive materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fluorotherm.com/technical-information/materials-overview/ptfe-properties/|title=PTFE Properties|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Fluorotherm Polymers, Inc.|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemicals are used in a lot of different consumer goods, but they are also used in a lot of different other sectors; including agriculture manufacturing, construction, and service industries.&lt;ref name=Chemistry /&gt; Major industrial customers include rubber and [[plastic]] products, [[textile]]s, apparel, petroleum refining, [[paper chemicals|pulp and paper]], and primary metals. Chemicals are nearly a $3 trillion global enterprise, and the EU and U.S. chemical companies are the world's largest producers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Sales of the chemical business can be divided into a few broad categories, including basic chemicals (about 35 to 37 percent of the dollar output), life sciences (30 percent), specialty chemicals (20 to 25 percent) and consumer products (about 10 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Technofunc|title=Sectors of Chemical Industry|url=http://www.technofunc.com/index.php/domain-knowledge/chemicals-industry/item/sectors-of-chemical-industry|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic Chemicals &amp; Commodity Chemicals to Polymers and Specialty Chemicals===

[[File:Slovnaft - new polypropylene plant PP3.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|New polypropylene plant PP3 in the [[Slovnaft]] oil refinery ([[Bratislava]], Slovakia)]]
Basic chemicals, or "commodity chemicals" are a broad chemical category including polymers, bulk petrochemicals and intermediates, other derivatives and basic industrials, [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic chemicals]], and [[fertilizer]]s. Typical growth rates for basic chemicals are about 0.5 to 0.7 times GDP.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Product prices are generally less than fifty cents per pound.{Citation needed|date=May 2010}

'''Polymers''', the largest revenue segment at about 33 percent of the basic chemicals dollar value, includes all categories of [[plastics industry|plastics]] and man-made fibers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The major markets for plastics are [[packaging]], followed by home construction, containers, appliances, pipe, transportation, toys, and games. 
* The largest-volume polymer product, [[polyethylene]] (PE), is used mainly in packaging films and other markets such as milk bottles, containers, and pipe.
* [[Polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), another large-volume product, is principally used to make piping for construction markets as well as siding and, to a much smaller extent, transportation and packaging materials.
* [[Polypropylene]] (PP), similar in volume to PVC, is used in markets ranging from packaging, appliances, and containers to clothing and carpeting.
* [[Polystyrene]] (PS), another large-volume plastic, is used principally for appliances and packaging as well as toys and recreation.
* The leading [[synthetic fiber|man-made fibers]] include [[polyester]], [[nylon]], polypropylene, and [[Acrylic fiber|acrylics]], with applications including apparel, home furnishings, and other industrial and consumer use.
The principal raw materials for polymers are bulk petrochemicals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Chemicals in the bulk '''[[petrochemicals]]''' and intermediates are primarily made from [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG), [[natural gas]], and [[crude oil]]. Their sales volume is close to 30 percent of overall basic chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} 
Typical large-volume products include [[ethylene]], [[propylene]], [[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[xylenes]], [[methanol]], [[vinyl chloride monomer]] (VCM), [[styrene]], [[butadiene]], and [[ethylene oxide]]. These basic or commodity chemicals are the starting materials used to manufacture many [[polymer]]s and other more complex organic chemicals particularly those that are made for use in the [[specialty chemicals]] category (see below).

'''Other derivatives''' and basic industrials include [[synthetic rubber]], [[surfactant]]s, [[dye]]s and [[pigment]]s, [[turpentine]], [[resin]]s, [[carbon black]], [[explosive]]s, and rubber products and contribute about 20 percent of the basic chemicals' external sales.

'''[[inorganic chemistry|Inorganic chemicals]]''' (about 12 percent of the revenue output) make up the oldest of the chemical categories. Products include [[salt]], [[chlorine]], [[caustic soda]], [[soda ash]], acids (such as [[nitric acid]], [[phosphoric acid]], and [[sulfuric acid]]), [[titanium dioxide]], and [[hydrogen peroxide]].

'''[[Fertilizers]]''' are the smallest category (about 6 percent) and include [[phosphate]]s, [[ammonia]], and [[potash]] chemicals.

===Life sciences===
Life sciences (about 30 percent of the dollar output of the chemistry business) include differentiated chemical and biological substances, [[pharmaceutical]]s, diagnostics, [[veterinary medicine|animal health products]], [[vitamin]]s, and [[pesticides]]. While much smaller in volume than other chemical sectors, their products tend to have very high prices—over ten dollars per pound—growth rates of 1.5 to 6 times GDP, and research and development spending at 15 to 25 percent of sales. Life science products are usually produced with very high specifications and are closely scrutinized by government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration. Pesticides, also called "crop protection chemicals", are about 10 percent of this category and include [[herbicides]], [[insecticide]]s, and [[fungicide]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Specialty chemicals===
[[Specialty chemicals]] are a category of relatively high valued, rapidly growing chemicals with diverse end product markets. Typical growth rates are one to three times GDP with prices over a dollar per pound. They are generally characterized by their innovative aspects. Products are sold for what they can do rather than for what chemicals they contain. Products include electronic chemicals, [[industrial gases]], adhesives and sealants as well as coatings, industrial and institutional cleaning chemicals, and catalysts. In 2012, excluding fine chemicals, the $546 billion global speciality chemical market was 33% Paints, Coating and Surface Treatments, 27% Advanced Polymer, 14% Adhesives and Sealants, 13% additives and 13% pigments and inks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher==Marketline|title=Global Specialty Chemicals|url=http://2012e.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Global_Specialty_Chemicals_Profile.pdf|date=May 2012|accessdate=16 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115071331/http://2012e.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Global_Specialty_Chemicals_Profile.pdf|archivedate=15 November 2012|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Speciality chemicals]] are sold as effect or performance chemicals. Sometimes they are mixtures of formulations, unlike "[[fine chemicals]]," which are almost always single-molecule products.

===Consumer products===
Consumer products include direct product sale of chemicals such as [[soap]]s, [[detergent]]s, and [[cosmetics]]. Typical growth rates are 0.8 to 1.0 times GDP.

Consumers rarely if ever come into contact with basic chemicals but polymers and speciality chemicals are the materials that they will encounter everywhere in their everyday lives, such as in plastics, cleaning materials, cosmetics, paints &amp; coatings, electronic gadgets, automobiles and the materials used to construct their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher=MarketLine|title=Global Speciality Chemicals|url=http://2012e.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Global_Specialty_Chemicals_Profile.pdf|date=May 2012|access-date=2012-09-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115071331/http://2012e.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Global_Specialty_Chemicals_Profile.pdf|archivedate=2012-11-15|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These speciality products are marketed by chemical companies to the downstream manufacturing industries as [[pesticides]], [[Polymers|speciality polymers]], electronic chemicals, [[surfactants]], construction chemicals, Industrial Cleaners, [[flavours]] and [[fragrances]], speciality coatings, printing inks, water-soluble polymers, [[food additives]], [[paper chemicals]], oil field chemicals, plastic adhesives, [[adhesives]] and [[sealants]], [[Cosmetic ingredients|cosmetic chemicals]], [[Water treatment|water management chemicals]], [[catalysts]], textile chemicals. Chemical companies rarely supply these products directly to the consumer.

Every year, the [[American Chemistry Council]] tabulates the U.S. production volume of the top 100 chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-tTWNufb3wC&amp;pg=PA379&amp;lpg=PA379&amp;dq=Every+year,+the+American+Chemistry+Council+tabulates+the+U.S.+production+volume+of+the+top+100+chemicals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oghc5shhcD&amp;sig=-o3fTx4ZfLPxIGxuBcvCgg7sZXE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5nKWf2v3YAhWo44MKHa2mC38Q6AEIPTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Every%20year,%20the%20American%20Chemistry%20Council%20tabulates%20the%20U.S.%20production%20volume%20of%20the%20top%20100%20chemicals&amp;f=false|title=Chemistry|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2000, the aggregate production volume of the top 100 chemicals totalled 502 million tons, up from 397 million tons in 1990. 
Inorganic chemicals tend to be the largest volume, though much smaller in dollar revenue terms due to their low prices. The top 11 of the 100 chemicals in 2000 were [[sulfuric acid]] (44 million tons), [[nitrogen]] (34), [[ethylene]] (28), [[oxygen]] (27), [[Lime (material)|lime]] (22), [[ammonia]] (17), [[propylene]] (16), [[polyethylene]] (15), [[chlorine]] (13), [[phosphoric acid]] (13) and [[diammonium phosphate]]s (12).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-tTWNufb3wC&amp;pg=PA379&amp;lpg=PA379&amp;dq=The+top+11+of+the+100+chemicals+in+2000+were+sulfuric+acid+(44+million+tons),+nitrogen+(34),+ethylene+(28),+oxygen+(27),+lime+(22),+ammonia+(17),+propylene+(16),+polyethylene+(15),+chlorine+(13),+phosphoric+acid+(13)+and+diammonium+phosphates&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oghc5shn3D&amp;sig=D8nl9Hp1kPzKBtgFXCx7Rk5XXsY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjInJmS3P3YAhVp5IMKHdb7BW4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20top%2011%20of%20the%20100%20chemicals%20in%202000%20were%20sulfuric%20acid%20(44%20million%20tons),%20nitrogen%20(34),%20ethylene%20(28),%20oxygen%20(27),%20lime%20(22),%20ammonia%20(17),%20propylene%20(16),%20polyethylene%20(15),%20chlorine%20(13),%20phosphoric%20acid%20(13)%20and%20diammonium%20phosphates&amp;f=false|title=Chemistry|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Turbine generator systems1.png|thumb|This is a process diagram of a turbine generator. Engineers working to produce a sustainable process for use in the chemical industry need to know how to design a sustainable process in which the system can withstand or manipulate process-halting conditions such as heat, friction, pressure, emissions, and contaminants.]]

From the perspective of chemical engineers, the chemical industry involves the use of [[chemical process]]es such as [[chemical reaction]]s and [[refining]] methods to produce a wide variety of solid, liquid, and gaseous materials.  Most of these products serve to [[Manufacturing|manufacture]] other items, although a smaller number go directly to consumers.  [[Solvent]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[lye]], [[sodium carbonate|washing soda]], and [[portland cement]] provide a few examples of product used by consumers.

The industry includes manufacturers of [[inorganic]]- and [[Organic chemistry|organic]]-industrial chemicals, ceramic products, petrochemicals, agrochemicals,  polymers and rubber (elastomers), oleochemicals (oils, fats, and waxes), explosives, fragrances and flavors.  Examples of these products are shown in the Table below.

Although the [[pharmaceutical]] industry is often considered{{Who|date=November 2010}} a '''chemical industry ''', it has many different characteristics that puts it in a separate category.  Other closely related industries include [[petroleum]], [[glass]], [[paint]], [[ink]], [[sealant]], [[adhesive]], and [[food processing]] manufacturers.

Chemical processes such as chemical reactions operate in [[chemical plant]]s to form new substances in various types of reaction vessels.  In many cases the reactions take place in special corrosion-resistant equipment at elevated temperatures and pressures with the use of [[catalyst]]s. The products of these reactions are separated using a variety of techniques including [[distillation]] especially [[fractional distillation]], [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], [[crystallization]], [[adsorption]], [[filtration]], [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], and [[drying]].

The processes and product or products are usually tested during and after manufacture by dedicated instruments and on-site [[quality control]] [[Laboratory|laboratories]] to ensure safe operation and to assure that the product will meet required [[specification]]s. More organizations within the industry are implementing chemical compliance software to maintain quality products and [[manufacturing]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemical and Agrochemical Enterprise Quality Management Software|url=http://www.spartasystems.com/industries/other-industries/chemical-and-agrochemical/|publisher=Sparta Systems, Inc.|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The products are packaged and delivered by many methods, including pipelines, tank-cars, and tank-trucks (for both solids and liquids), cylinders, drums, bottles, and boxes.  Chemical companies often have a [[research-and-development]] laboratory for developing and testing products and processes.  These facilities may include pilot plants, and such research facilities may be located at a site separate from the production plant(s).

==World Chemical Production ==
[[File:Colonne distillazione.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Distillation columns]]
The scale of chemical manufacturing tends to be organized from largest in volume ([[petrochemical]]s and [[commodity chemicals]]), to [[specialty chemicals]], and the smallest, [[fine chemicals]].

The petrochemical and commodity chemical manufacturing units are on the whole single product continuous processing plants. Not all petrochemical or commodity chemical materials are made in one single location, but groups of related materials often are to induce industrial symbiosis as well as material, energy and utility efficiency and other economies of scale.

Those chemicals made on the largest of scales are made in a few manufacturing locations around the world, for example in [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]] along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] of the [[United States]], on [[Teesside]] in the [[Northeast of England]] in the [[United Kingdom]], and in [[Rotterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]]. The large scale manufacturing locations often have clusters of manufacturing units that share utilities and large scale infrastructure such as [[power stations]], [[Port|port facilities]], road and rail terminals. To demonstrate the clustering and integration mentioned above, some 50% of the United Kingdom's petrochemical and commodity chemicals are produced by the [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]] on [[Teesside]].
 
Specialty chemical and fine chemical manufacturing are mostly made in discrete batch processes. These manufacturers are often found in similar locations but in many cases they are to be found in multi sector business parks.

===Continents and Countries===
In the U.S. there are 170 major chemical companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6trCF6poRSQC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=In+the+U.S.+there+are+170+major+chemical+companies.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLyrPv3P3YAhUC7YMKHX3eD3IQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20the%20U.S.%20there%20are%20170%20major%20chemical%20companies.&amp;f=false|title=CHEMISTRY IN DAILY LIFE|last=SINGH|first=KIRPAL|date=2012-07-07|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=9788120346178|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;They operate internationally with more than 2,800 facilities outside the U.S. and 1,700 foreign subsidiaries or affiliates operating. The U.S. chemical output is $750 billion a year.  The U.S. industry records large trade surpluses and employs more than a million people in the United States alone. The chemical industry is also the second largest consumer of energy in manufacturing and spends over $5 billion annually on pollution abatement.

In Europe the chemical, plastics and rubber sectors are among the largest industrial sectors.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Together they generate about 3.2 million jobs in more than 60,000 companies. Since 2000 the chemical sector alone has represented 2/3 of the entire manufacturing trade surplus of the EU.

in 2012 The chemical sector accounted for 12% of the EU manufacturing industry's added value. Europe remains world’s biggest chemical trading region with 43% of the world’s exports and 37%of the world’s imports, although the latest data shows that Asia is catching up with 34% of the exports and 37% of imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=CEFIC|title=Facts and Figures 2012:The European chemicals industry in a worldwide perspective|url=http://www.cefic.org/Documents/FactsAndFigures/2012/Facts-and-Figures-2012-The-Brochure.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Europe still has a trading surplus with all regions of the world except Japan and China where in 2011 there was a chemical trade balance. Europe’s trade surplus with the rest of the world today amounts to 41.7 billion Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stan|last=Higgins|publisher=Chemical News|title=European Chemicals Industry:A review|url=http://www.nepic.co.uk/WebformFolder/IndiaChemicalNews_Issue3.pdf|date=April 2013|pages=18–20|access-date=2013-08-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723230317/http://www.nepic.co.uk/WebformFolder/IndiaChemicalNews_Issue3.pdf#|archive-date=2015-07-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the 20 years between 1991 and 2011 the European Chemical industry saw its sales increase 295 billion Euros to 539 billion Euros a picture of constant growth. Despite this the European industry’s share of the world chemical market has fallen from 36% to 20%. This has resulted from the huge increase production and sales in the emerging markets like India and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=CEFIC|title=Facts and Figures 2012:The European chemicals industry in a worldwide perspective|url=http://www.cefic.org/Documents/FactsAndFigures/2012/Facts-and-Figures-2012-The-Brochure.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2013|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data suggest that 95% of this impact is from China alone. In 2012 the data from the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC)shows that 5 European countries account for 71% of the EU's chemicals sales. These are Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=CEFIC|title=Facts and Figures 2012:The European chemicals industry in a worldwide perspective|url=http://www.cefic.org/Documents/FactsAndFigures/2012/Facts-and-Figures-2012-The-Brochure.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2013|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical industry has shown rapid growth for more than fifty years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The fastest-growing areas have involved the manufacture of synthetic [[organic polymer]]s used as [[plastics]], [[fibres]] and [[elastomers]]. Historically and presently the chemical industry has been concentrated in three areas of the world, Western Europe, North America and Japan (the Triad). The European Community remains the largest producer area followed by the US and Japan.

The traditional dominance of chemical production by the Triad countries is being challenged by changes in feedstock availability and price, labour cost, energy cost, differential rates of economic growth and environmental pressures. Instrumental in the changing structure of the global chemical industry has been the growth in China, India, Korea, the Middle East, South East Asia, Nigeria, and Brazil.

Just as companies emerge as the main producers of the chemical industry, we can also look on a more global scale to how industrialized countries rank, with regards to the billions of dollars worth of production a country or region could export.  Though the business of chemistry is worldwide in scope, the bulk of the world’s $3.7 trillion chemical output is accounted for by only a handful of industrialized nations. The United States alone produced $689 billion, 18.6 percent of the total world chemical output in 2008.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_acc/sec_directory.asp?CID=292&amp;DID=747|title=Global Business of Chemistry|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019103305/http://americanchemistry.com/s_acc/sec_directory.asp?CID=292&amp;DID=747#|archive-date=2010-10-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Bayldon "Chris" Barber''' (19 March 1921 – 8 July 2012) was a British Quaker businessman and was the Chairman of [[Oxfam]] from 1983 to 1989.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' Obituary 20 August 2012 Cited above – Sources.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Full name given in an announcement of a memorial meeting 13 October 2012, in [[The Friend (Quaker)|The Friend]] 24 August 2012 p.17&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Bootham School]], York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bootham School Register|place=York, England&lt;!--|publisher=Bootham Old Scholars Association--&gt;|publisher=BOSA|first=Jenny | last=Woodland |year=2011|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==War==
As a Quaker, 18-year-old Chris Barber, was opposed to war and chose to join the [[Friends Ambulance Unit]] before he was called up. He faced a [[Conscientious Objector]] Tribunal, refusing to seek favourable treatment by declaring himself a Quaker. He was, however, permitted to join the FAU, with whom he worked until 1947. His service included a period of war relief work in China.&lt;ref&gt;China: ''See'' items in list of Chris Barber's writings concerning China. ''See also'' [http://www.fauchinaconvoy.org FAU China Convoy Reunion Group website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Biscuits business==
When he returned, he trained as an accountant and joined the family firm, [[Jacob's|Jacob's Biscuits]], in 1949. By innovations, mergers and acquisitions, the firm grew to become [[Huntley &amp; Palmer]] then Associated Biscuits and he rose to be Finance Director.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Barber's employer, Associated Biscuits, is now called [[United Biscuits]]&lt;/ref&gt; He retired in 1980.

==Famine relief==
In 1980, he had joined the Board of Trustees of Oxfam. In 1983, he became its Chair, in which role, he served until 1989. "Oxfam grew dramatically&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what-we-do/about-us/history-of-oxfam Oxfam History timeline for the decade 1980 – 1989]

*1982. ''Bitter Pills'' published: We publish a new report on the relationship between pharmaceutical companies and poverty. It’s the latest in a series of books that helps bolster Oxfam’s reputation as a wide-ranging expert on development issues. (by [[Dianna Melrose]])
*1984. [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia|Famine in Ethiopia]]: Harrowing TV footage prompts unprecedented public support and a surge of interest in the crisis in Africa. Initiatives like [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] contribute to Oxfam's response, and our income doubles in a single year – to £51 million.
*1984. 'Hungry for Change': [[Jonathan Dimbleby]], [[Roy Hattersley]], [[Edward Heath|Ted Heath]] and [[Joanna Lumley]] help launch an initiative to raise funds and awareness for Oxfam's food work. Within a year, Oxfam has a network of more than 300 groups nationwide
*1985. Giant march on House of Commons: 20,000 supporters of Oxfam and other charities join the biggest ever lobby (at the time) on parliament to call for more aid, especially to Africa. One million people sign a petition in support. (For a contemporary account, ''see'' “Lobbyists attack aid record” by Seumas Milne in ''The Guardian'' (1959–2003); 23 October 1985; pg. 2.)
*1986. GADU gets going: It might not have the most glamorous name, but the launch of the Gender and Development Unit (or GADU) is definitely a landmark moment. GADU focuses money and attention on women’s development – a key element of Oxfam’s work to this day.
*1988. First [[Comic Relief|Red Nose Day]]: Oxfam sells the plastic noses that quickly become synonymous with the biannual festival of life-changing comedy. We've been closely linked with Comic Relief since it was born in 1985 – and we still proudly stock their superlative scarlet snouts.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in his role as chairman, Chris was keen to ensure that the extra donations were used well, not just to tackle famine but to ensure sustainable development thereafter. His was a wise and compassionate hand on the tiller.&lt;ref name="HenleyStd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.henleystandard.co.uk/news/news.php?id=1140260 |title=Henley on Thames – Quaker company director who became Oxfam chairman |publisher=Henleystandard.co.uk |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=23 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203223918/http://www.henleystandard.co.uk/news/news.php?id=1140260 |archivedate=3 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;"

He was a "hands-on" Chair and was deeply concerned with Oxfam's decision, in November 1985, to close its bank account at [[Barclays Bank]] because of Barclays involvement with the South African [[Apartheid]] regime. He travelled to South America, India and Sudan and sorted out a diplomatic disaster in Cambodia.&lt;ref name="TimesObit"&gt;''The Times'' Obituary- Cited above – Sources&lt;/ref&gt; Long after his retirement, he could be found, helping out, at the Oxfam bookshop in [[Henley-on-Thames|Henley]].&lt;ref name="HenleyStd"/&gt;

==Quaker activities==
Chris Barber and his wife, Anne&lt;ref&gt;Anne Satterthwaite Barber: testimony, Cited above – Sources. Anne lived 1 January 1923 to 12 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; had met at their Quaker schools in York.&lt;ref&gt;"Quaker schools in York" : presumably [[The Mount School, York]] (girls) and [[Bootham School]] (boys).&lt;/ref&gt; They married in January 1952.  Both were active in local, regional and national Quaker activities. Chris, among other roles, was Chairman of the Social Responsibility Council, 1970 – 1972; Clerk of Quaker Social Responsibility and education, 1979 – 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Description of contributors to ''A Quaker miscellany for Edward H. Milligan'', edited by David Blamires, Jeremy Greenwood and Alex Kerr, published by David Blamires (1985) {{ISBN|0-9510152-1-4}} p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; He served on [[Quaker Peace and Social Witness|Quaker Peace and Service Central Committee]] from 1993 to 1998&lt;ref&gt;QPS CC period of service – source – email from Friends House Library 30 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
The obituary in ''The Henley Standard'' said:&lt;blockquote&gt; ". . . he was known for organising treasure hunts on and around [[Rotherfield Peppard|Peppard Common]] and many other activities involving local families.

For several years he organised a [[hockey]] match at New Year on a field near the Dog in Peppard with 20 or 30 people, from small children to ageing grandparents, on each side and no referee! Fortunately, the games were all played in good spirit and there were no injuries. On one occasion, the match was played in deep snow.".&lt;ref name="HenleyStd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Dog, mentioned in relation to the hockey game, is a [[public house]].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7820">'''Creeping normality''' or '''[[Death by a thousand cuts (disambiguation)|death by a thousand cuts]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foster|first1=Mike | name-list-format = vanc |title=Soft commissions: Death by a thousand cuts|url=http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2014-07-11/soft-commissions-for-asset-managers-face-a-thousand-cuts|publisher=[[Efinancialnews.com]]|access-date=2015-10-30|date=2014-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the way a major change can be accepted as the normal situation if it happens slowly, in unnoticed increments. The change would be regarded as objectionable if it took place in a single step or short period. 

The phrase was coined by American scientist, [[Jared Diamond]], in his 2005 book, [[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]].  He had previously alluded to this theory while attempting to explain why in the course of long-term [[environmental degradation]], [[Easter Island]] natives would, seemingly irrationally, chop down the last tree:&lt;ref name=Diamond&gt;{{cite web |last1=Diamond |first1=Jared |authorlink1=Jared Diamond |title=Easter's End |url= http://discovermagazine.com/1995/aug/eastersend543|publisher=Discover magazine |access-date=2014-08-03 |date=1995-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|"I suspect, though, that the disaster happened not with a bang but with a whimper. After all, there are those hundreds of abandoned statues to consider. The forest the islanders depended on for rollers and rope didn't simply disappear one day--it vanished slowly, over decades."|sign=|source=}}

In his book, Diamond also refers to creeping normality as landscape amnesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fogg|first=Graham E.|last2=LaBolle|first2=Eric M. | name-list-format = vanc |date=14 March 2006|title=Motivation of synthesis, with an example on groundwater quality sustainability |journal=Water Resources Research|volume=42|pages=W03S05|via=Google Scholar | doi = 10.1029/2005WR004372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Other uses==
Creeping normality has been used to explain a number of different phenomenon, including the ones listed below: 

=== Obese and overweight maternity patients ===
The term has also been used several times in conjunction with the increase of maternity patients who present as [[Obesity|obese]] and [[overweight]]. In their research article, authors Wilkinson, Poad, and Stapleton suggest that as the number of clinically obese or overweight pregnant women increase, the negative stigmatization with being so decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkinson SA, Poad D, Stapleton H | title = Maternal overweight and obesity: a survey of clinicians' characteristics and attitudes, and their responses to their pregnant clients | journal = BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth | volume = 13 | pages = 117 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23692981 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2393-13-117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmeid, et al, states that as doctors see more women of an unhealthy weight, they are less likely to advise healthy weight gain goals during [[pregnancy]], out of fear of [[Social stigma of obesity|fat-shaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmied VA, Duff M, Dahlen HG, Mills AE, Kolt GS | title = 'Not waving but drowning': a study of the experiences and concerns of midwives and other health professionals caring for obese childbearing women | journal = Midwifery | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 424–30 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 20381222 | doi = 10.1016/j.midw.2010.02.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mills A, Schmied VA, Dahlen HG | title = 'Get alongside us', women's experiences of being overweight and pregnant in Sydney, Australia | journal = Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 309–21 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 22168548 | doi = 10.1111/j.1740-8709.2011.00386.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the shift in society to accept women of all body types has been so slow, physicians may not be aware that they are not addressing the [[Gestational age|gestational]] weight gain as soon as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller M, Hearn L, van der Pligt P, Wilcox J, Campbell KJ | title = Preventing maternal and early childhood obesity: the fetal flaw in Australian perinatal care | journal = Australian Journal of Primary Health | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–7 | date = 2014-06-06 | pmid = 24176286 | doi = 10.1071/PY13080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous survey was conducted from January to April, 2010, of obstetrics and gynecology residents. Of those surveyed, only "7.6 percent selected correct BMI ranges for each category, and only 5.8 percent selected correct gestational weight gain ranges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore Simas TA, Waring ME, Sullivan GM, Liao X, Rosal MC, Hardy JR, Berry RE | title = Institute of medicine 2009 gestational weight gain guideline knowledge: survey of obstetrics/gynecology and family medicine residents of the United States | journal = Birth | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 237–46 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24344704 | pmc = 3974574 | doi = 10.1111/birt.12061 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Family Businesses ===
Antheaume and Barbelivien described the creeping normality that destroys businesses, causing them to not see the subtle, negative shifts in the community around them. The authors state that owners of [[Family business|family businesses]] are more likely to notice the small changes than a large [[corporation]], however "detecting a problem is no guarantee of the ability to solve it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283300199_Why_do_family_businesses_die_An_investigation_through_the_work_of_an_ethnologist_and_geographer_on_the_collapse_of_human_societies |title=Why do family businesses die? An investigation through the work of an ethnologist and geographer on the collapse of human societies| vauthors = Antheaume N, Barbelivien D | website=Research Gate }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Cybercrime ===
In his thesis, Chon states that the increase in [[cybercrime]] fits the pattern for creeping normality. The number of websites involved in "[[Security hacker|hacking]] and cybercrime activities"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Chon K | date=June 2016|title=Cybercrime precursors: Towards a model of offender resources|url=|journal=Australian National University|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has increased at a slow and steady pace, mostly below society's awareness. 

=== IPS-Nathan Lecture Series ===
Peter Ho referred to creeping normality in his four-part [[Institute of Policy Studies (Singapore)|IPS]]-Nathan lecture series in spring of 2017. In regards to several issues that [[Singapore]] is facing, he claimed that "things get just a little bit worse each year than the year before, but not bad enough for anyone to notice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Challenges of Governance in a Complex World|last=Tan|first=Ariel|last2=Ho|first2=Peter | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company Pte Limited|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is through [[climate change]], where he stated that the country did not realize an increase of flooding was caused by rising temperatures, and not poor drainage as first suspected.

In microeconomics, '''diseconomies of scale''' are the cost disadvantages that [[business|firm]]s and governments accrue due to increase in firm size or output, resulting in production of [[Product (business)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] at increased [[average cost|per-unit cost]]s. This typically follows the [[Diminishing returns|law of diminishing returns]], where further increase in size of output will result in even greater increase in average cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.intelligenteconomist.com/economies-of-scale/|title=Economies of Scale {{!}} Intelligent Economist|date=2017-08-03|work=Intelligent Economist|access-date=2017-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is the opposite of [[economies of scale]]. In business,  diseconomies of scale are the factors that lead to an increase in average costs as a business grows beyond a certain size.
[[File:Economies-of-Scale.jpg|alt=economies of scale|thumb|350x350px|The rising part of the [[long run average cost|long-run average cost]] curve illustrates the effect of [https://www.intelligenteconomist.com/economies-of-scale/ diseconomies of scale]. The Long Run Average Cost (LRAC) curve plots the average cost of producing the lowest cost method. The Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) is the change in total cost attributable to a change in the output of one unit after the plant size has been adjusted to produce that rate of output at minimum LRAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.intelligenteconomist.com/economies-of-scale/|title=Economies of Scale {{!}} Intelligent Economist|date=2017-08-03|work=Intelligent Economist|access-date=2017-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Causes==

===Communication costs===
Ideally, all employees of a firm would have one-on-one communication with each other so they know exactly what the other workers are doing. A firm with a single worker does not require any communication between employees. A firm with two workers requires one communication channel, directly between those two workers. A firm with three workers requires three communication channels between employees (between employees A &amp; B, B &amp; C, and A &amp; C). Here is a chart of one-on-one communication channels required:

|}
The graph of all one-on-one channels is a [[complete graph]].

The number of one-on-one channels of communication grows more rapidly than the number of workers, thus increasing the time and costs of communication. At some point one-on-one communications between all workers becomes impractical; therefore only certain groups of employees will communicate with one another (e.g. within departments or within geographical locations). This reduces, but does not stop, the increase in unit costs; and also the organisation will incur some inefficiencies due to the reduced level of communication.

===Duplication of effort===
An organisation with just one person cannot have any duplication of effort between employees. If there are two employees, there could be some duplication of efforts, but this is likely to be minor, as each of the two will generally know what the other is working on. When organisations grow to thousands of workers, it is inevitable that someone, or even a team, will take on a function that is already being handled by another person or team. In colloquial terms, this is described as "one hand not knowing what the other hand is doing". [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], for example, developed two in-house [[CAD/CAM]] systems: CADANCE was designed by the GM Design Staff, while Fisher Graphics was created by the former Fisher Body division. These similar systems later needed to be combined into a single Corporate Graphics System, CGS, at great expense. A smaller firm would have had neither the money to allow such expensive parallel developments, nor the lack of communication and cooperation which precipitated this event. In addition to CGS, GM also used [[CADAM]], UNIGRAPHICS, [[CATIA]] and other off-the-shelf CAD/CAM systems, thus increasing the cost of translating designs from one system to another. This endeavor eventually became so unmanageable that they acquired (and then eventually sold off) [[Electronic Data Systems]] (EDS) in an effort to control the situation. Smaller firms typically choose a single off-the-shelf CAD/CAM system, with no need to combine or translate between systems.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Office politics===
"Office politics" is management behavior which a manager knows is counter to the best interest of the company, but is in his personal best interest. For example, a manager might intentionally promote an incompetent worker, knowing that the worker will never be able to compete for the manager's job. This type of behavior only makes sense in a company with multiple levels of management. The more levels there are, the more opportunity for this behavior. In a small company, such behavior could cause the company to go bankrupt, and thus cost the manager his job, so he would not make such a decision. In a large company, one manager would not have much effect on the overall health of the company, so such "office politics" are in the interest of individual managers.

===Top-heavy companies===
As an organisation increases in size, it becomes costly to keep control of a sprawling corporate empire, and this often results in bureaucracy as executives implement more and more levels of management. As firms increase in size, managers will initially provide a net benefit to the firm and increase productivity; however, as a firm grows and covers a larger geographical area and/or employs more people, a [[principal–agent problem]] arises, leading to lower productivity. To counter this, executives introduce standards and controls in order to maintain productivity, and this necessitates the hiring of more managers to apply these standards and controls, hence the proportion of managerial to working class begins to lean towards managerial and the company becomes "top-heavy". However, these additional managers are not providing additional output: they are spending their time implementing standards and carrying out supervision that is unnecessary in smaller firms, hence the cost-per-unit has increased.

==Other effects which reduce competitiveness of large firms==

These do not always increase the cost-per-unit, but do reduce the ability of a large firm to compete.

===Cannibalization===

A small firm only competes with other firms, but larger firms frequently find their own products are competing with each other. A [[Buick]] was just as likely to steal customers from another [[General Motors|GM]] make, such as an [[Oldsmobile]], as it was to steal customers from other companies. This may help to explain why Oldsmobiles were discontinued after 2004. This [[self-competition]] wastes resources that should be used to compete with other firms.

===Isolation of decision-makers from the results of their decisions===

If a single person makes and sells donuts and decides to try jalapeño flavoring, they would likely know on the same day whether their decision was good or not, based on the reaction of customers. A decision-maker at a huge company that makes donuts may not know for many months if such a decision worked out or not, especially if their research or marketing team fails to respond in a timely manner. By that time, the decision-makers may very well have moved on to another division or company and thus see no consequence from their decision. This lack of consequences can lead to poor decisions and cause an upward-sloping average cost curve.

===Slow response time===

In a reverse example, the smaller firm will know immediately if people begin to request other products, and be able to respond the next day. A large company would need to do research, create an assembly line, determine which distribution chains to use, plan an advertising campaign, etc., before any changes could be made. By this time, the smaller competitors may well have grabbed that market niche.

===Inertia (Unwillingness to change)===

This will be defined as the "we've always done it that way, so there's no need to ever change" attitude (see [[appeal to tradition]]). An old, successful company is far more likely to have this attitude than a new, struggling one. While "change for change's sake" is counter-productive, refusal to consider change, even when indicated, is likewise toxic to a company, as changes in the industry and market conditions will inevitably demand changes in the firm in order to remain successful. An example is [[Polaroid Corporation]]'s delay in moving into digital imaging, which adversely affected the company, ultimately leading to bankruptcy.

===Public and government opposition===

Such opposition is largely a function of the size of the firm. Behavior from [[Microsoft]], which would have been ignored from a smaller firm, was seen as an anti-competitive and monopolistic threat, due to Microsoft's size, thus bringing about government lawsuits.

===Large market share===

A small company with only a 1% market share could relatively easily double market share, and hence revenues, in a year. A large company with 50% market share will find it difficult to do so.

===Large market portfolio===

A small investment fund can potentially yield a higher return because it can concentrate its investments in a small number of good opportunities without driving up the purchase price as they buy in, and later sell them without driving down the sale price as they sell off. Conversely, a large investment fund must spread its investments among so many securities that its results tend to track those of the market as a whole. As the size of the market controlled grows, the results will be closer to market average.

===Inelasticity of supply===

A company which is heavily dependent on a resource supply of a fixed or relatively-fixed size will have trouble increasing production.  For instance, a timber company cannot increase production above the sustainable harvest rate of its land (although it can still increase production by acquiring more land).  Similarly, service companies are limited by available labor (and thus tend to concentrate in large, densely-populated metropolitan areas); [[STEM fields|STEM]] (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) professions are often-cited examples.

===Other effects related to size===

Large firms also tend to be old and in mature markets. Both of these have negative implications for future growth. Old firms tend to have a large retiree base, with high associated pension and health costs, and also tend to be [[unionized]], with associated higher labor costs and lower productivity{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. Mature markets tend to only offer the potential for small, incremental growth. (Everybody might go out and buy a new invention next year, but it is unlikely they will all buy cars next year, since most people already have them.)

===Impact on smaller firms===
While diseconomies of scale are typically associated with large mature firms, similar problems have been observed in the growth phase of small and medium-sized manufacturing companies. Mclean&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLean|first1=Timothy A.|title=Grow Your Factory, Grow Your Profits: Lean for Small and Medium Sized Manufacturing Enterprises|date=December 2014|publisher=Productivity Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4822-5585-0|url=http://txm.com.au/store/products/grow-factory-grow-profits-lean-small-medium-sized-manufacturing-enterprises}}&lt;/ref&gt; has observed that this can occur once the workforce exceeds around 20 employees. At this point business complexity grows more rapidly than revenue. The business experiences falling productivity, leading to rising variable costs along with rapidly rising overheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLean|first1=Timothy A|title=Lean for Small and Medium Sized Manufacturing Enterprises|url=http://txm.com.au/download-lean-manufacturing-small-medium-sized-enterprise-presentation|website=TXM Lean Solutions|ref=Slides 8-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
Solutions to the diseconomies of scale for large firms may involve splitting the company into smaller organisations. This can either happen by default when the company is in financial difficulties, sells off its profitable divisions and shuts down the rest; or can happen proactively, if the management is willing.

To avoid the negative effects of diseconomies of scale, a firm must stick to the lowest average output cost and try to recognise any external diseconomies of scale. Moreover, on reaching the lowest average cost, a firm must either expand to other countries to increase demand for its products, or seek new markets or produce new products that do not compete with its original products. However, neither of these actions will necessarily eliminate communications and management problems often associated with large organisations.

A systematic analysis and redesign of [[business processes]], in order to reduce complexity, can counter diseconomies of scale. (Of course, this phase of analysis and revamping in itself can be, and usually is, a diseconomy leading to hiring of new personnel and investment in new, competing systems.) This leads to increased productivity. Improved management systems and more effective control of labor and operations can lower overhead.

===Example===

Returning to the example of the large donut firm, each retail location could be allowed to operate relatively autonomously from the company headquarters.

For instance, the local management may decide on the following factors instead of relying on the central management:
# Employee decisions such as hiring, firing, promotions and wage scales, where the local management is directly involved and likely to have better understanding of each employee. For instance, employers may choose to offer higher wages and charge higher prices if they are in an affluent area.
# Purchasing decisions, with each location allowed to choose its own suppliers, which may or may not be owned by the corporation (wherever they find the best quality and prices).
# Research and marketing decisions. Each firm may decide to develop their own recipes or utilise different signature flavour unique to their locale. For instance, when fresh apple cider is available at bargain prices from local farmers in October, they may choose to market a cinnamon donut and hot apple cider combo.
While a single, large, centrally-controlled firm may have higher ability to innovate and develop or market new products more effectively than when its resources are divided, it may lack the flexibility to offer individual customizations. Allowing the different retail locations to make decisions independent of the central management may allow them to meet local consumers' demands more efficiently.

In addition, if the employees own a portion of the local business, employees will also have more vested interest in its success.

Note that all these changes will likely result in a substantial reduction in corporate headquarters staff and other support staff. For this reason, many businesses delay such a reorganization until it is too late to be effective. However, the whole company incurs reputation and legal risks arising from each unit.

==History==
{{main|History of ESPN}}
ESPN Inc. was founded in 1979 by [[Bill Rasmussen]] attempting to broadcast Connecticut sports over an "Entertainment and Sports Programming Network" cable channel. [[Getty Oil]], [[Anheuser-Busch]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] all got involved with the new cable channel. In 1984, American television network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] purchased a stake in the company. ABC merged with [[Capital Cities/ABC Inc.|Capital Cities Communications]]. The combined company was purchased by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 1996. In 2018, ESPN launched a new streaming service called ESPN+.

Shortly after being terminated as [[World Hockey Association]]'s [[Hartford Whalers|New England Whalers]] communications director, Rasmussen conceived in May 1978 of a plan to product Connecticut sports events for Connecticut cable systems.&lt;ref name="sbj"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ourand|first1=John|title=Champions: Bill Rasmussen, ESPN creator|url=https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2011/04/04/People-and-Pop-Culture/Rasmussen.aspx|accessdate=March 27, 2018|work=Sports Business Journal|publisher=American City Business Journals|date=April 4, 2011|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his son, Scott, they had move beyond that considering a national sports channel doable.&lt;ref name="sbj"/&gt; [[RCA]] had an underused satellite thus pushing for customers. Finding it cheaper to rent a satellite transponder full-time instead of 5 hours a day, they changed their plans to a national channel.&lt;ref name="idch"&gt;{{cite book|title=International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 56|date=2004|publisher=St. James Press|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/espn-inc-history/|accessdate=March 27, 2018|language=en|chapter=History of ESPN, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Rasmussen got the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] on February 7, 1979 in principal to grant ESPN broadcast rights for its sports. The next day at the Texas Cable Show, he was able to get cable companies on board. An advertising contract with Anheuser-Busch was in talk at that time. [[Getty Oil]] came on board as its major source of capital. In 1979, Rasummen purchased the first acre for ESPN's headquarters in Bristol, Conn.&lt;ref name="sbj"/&gt; With a reasonable payment program in July 1979, Rasmussen leased RCA's Satcom 1 transponder using his credit card. Anheuser-Busch became a major sponsor signing a $1.4 million ad contract, a record at the time. Getty Oil invested $10 million into ESPN getting a controlling stake in 1979.&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt;

On September 7, 1979, [[ESPN]] cable channel went on the air&lt;ref name="sbj"/&gt; with 24-hours of programming on the weekends and limited hours during the week. 625 cable system affiliates were signed up at launch and they had 1 million household subscribed total (out of 20 million households with cable). The channel's first game featured the Milwaukee Schlitzes and the Kentucky Bourbons [[Men's professional softball in the United States|slow-pitch world series softball]].&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt;

In 1980, the company was named in a Texas divorce filing. Ground breaking for its headquarters took place.&lt;ref name="sbj"/&gt; Full-time broadcasting began in September 1980. Additional programming at the time included weekly boxing matches.&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt;

NBC Sports President Chet Simmons was hired to help run the cable channel. Simmons and Rasmussen were at odds with Getty Oil executives siding with Simmons. At the end of 1980, Rasmussen was removed as company president by Getty Oil executive for ESPN, Stuart Evey, relegating him to a ceremonial role. Rasmussen left in 1981 and sold his remaining stock in 1984.&lt;ref name="sbj"/&gt;

Investing another $15 million into the company and no profits expected any time soon, Getty used management consultant McKinsey &amp; Co. to assess ESPN's future. McKinsey's lead consultant was Roger Werner, who figured with another $120 million and five years ESPN would become a profit maker. Werner soon was hired by ESPN as vice-president of finance, administration, and planning and developed a new business plan. Werner developed a new revenue source beyond advertising by initiating revolutionary affiliate fees paid by the cable operators by number of subscribers starting at 6 cents. Between CBS Cable folding in October 1982 and the new CEO, Bill Grimes, they convince most of the reluctant cable providers to pay. By 1985, the fee was 10 cents.&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt;

ESPN was the largest cable channel by the end of 1983 with 28.5 million households. Also in 1983, the company began distributing programming outside the US. ABC, Inc. purchased in January 1984 a 14% holding in the company followed by a June purchased of a controlling interest. Capital Cities Communications, Inc. bought ABC in early 1986 to form Capital Cities/ABC Inc. In 1988, Werner became ESPN's president and CEO.&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt;

===Multichannel===

ESPN started out expanding into other nations and additional channels. The ESPN International unit was formed in 1988 to start channels in other nations beginning with ESPN Latin America in 1989. In 1992, ESPN Asia was launched. ESPN partnered with [[TF1]] and [[Canal+]] for a made over [[Eurosport]] to enter Europe.&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt;

[[RJR Nabisco]] sold its 20 percent stake in ESPN to the [[Hearst Communications|Hearst Corporation]]. Werner resigned as CEO and president in October 1990 for another sports CEO job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Werner to Leave ESPN, Join Daniels' Firm |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-30/business/fi-542_1_bill-daniels |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=August 30, 1990 |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Bornstein]] replaced him in the CEO post moving up from the second position of executive vice-president in charge of programming and production.&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt;

With [[ABC Radio Network]], the company started [[ESPN Radio]] Network in 1991 with programming 16 hours per week. Ohlmeyer Communications' sports programming division was purchased in March 1993.&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt; ESPN launched [[ESPN2]] on October 1, 1993 at 7:30 PM. The channel at the time was targeting those age 18-34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Frager|first1=Ray |title=Whether you get it or not, ESPN2 has no tie to the tried and true |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-10-01/sports/1993274121_1_sportsnight-sportscenter-olbermann|accessdate=March 28, 2018|work=Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=October 1, 1993|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, ESPN acquired Creative Sports&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.espnfrontrow.com/2018/04/espn-remembers-dan-shoemaker/|title=ESPN remembers Dan Shoemaker - ESPN Front Row|date=2018-04-06|work=ESPN Front Row|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from Dow Jones an 80 percent stake in SportsTicker.&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt;

ESPN purchased for $175 million [[ESPN Classic|Classic Sports Network]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David |last=Whitford |title=The king of the sports deal |date=May 25, 2010 |url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/05/10/news/companies/greenberg_sports_deal_king.fortune/ |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522034442/http://money.cnn.com/2010/05/10/news/companies/greenberg_sports_deal_king.fortune/ |archivedate=May 22, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, ESPN acquired the North American Sports Network (NASN), later re-branded as [[ESPN America]] on February 1, 2009, Super Bowl Sunday.&lt;ref name="Times658043"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hancock | first = Ciaran | title = Ireland: TV3 grabs Setanta stake | work = [[The Times]] | date = 3 December 2006 | url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article658043.ece | accessdate = 2007-08-07  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN America"&gt;{{cite news |last=Welsh|first=James|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a131634/nasn-to-become-espn-america.html|title=NASN to become ESPN America|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=2 October 2008|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Disney purchased a 1/3 stake in [[BAMTech]] for $1 billion from [[MLB Advanced Media]] with the option to purchase a majority share, which it later exercised now owning 75% . Disney purchased the stake to first develop an ESPN subscription streaming service, later named [[ESPN+]]. The service would not include any current ESPN channel or its content, but tap BAMTech licensed rights and ESPN college rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Daniel|title=Walt Disney Co. buys stake in video streaming service BAMTech|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html|access-date=August 17, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]'s rules regarding foreign broadcasters, ESPN has been prohibited from acquiring majority ownership of any channel operating in Canada. Instead, ESPN partnered with several Canadian firms to form a privately held consortium named NetStar Communications in 1995, which then acquired the sports networks [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and [[Réseau des sports|RDS]]. These Canadian partners then sold their shares in 2001 to CTV Inc. (now [[Bell Media]]). ESPN continues to own 20 percent of what is now [[List of assets owned by Bell Media#CTV Specialty Television|CTV Specialty Television]] while Bell Media owns the remaining 80 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CTV can acquire TSN if it unloads Sportsnet | publisher=Globeandmail.com |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/ctv-can-acquire-tsn-if-it-unloads-sportsnet/article1038075/ |accessdate=March 20, 2017 |location=Toronto | date=March 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sports channels owned by the CTV Specialty Television subsidiary:
*[[The Sports Network|TSN]] – five feeds
*[[Réseau des sports|RDS]]

*[[RDS Info]]
*[[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]]

Through CTV Specialty Television, ESPN also has an indirect interest in several channels operated in partnership with [[Discovery Communications]], but ESPN is not believed to be directly involved with these operations.

In 2006, ESPN acquired the North American Sports Network (NASN), later re-branded as [[ESPN America]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="Times658043"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN America"/&gt; ESPN launched a [[BT Sport ESPN|domestic channel]] in the United Kingdom after acquiring a portion of the local rights package to the [[Premier League]] alongside [[Sky Sports]], replacing the collapsing [[Setanta Sports]]. The contract lasted from the 2009-10 season to the 2012-13 season.&lt;ref name="bbc-espnepl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8109954.stm|title=Setanta loses Premier TV rights|work=[[BBC News]]|date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN snaps up"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/656557/espn-snaps-up-premier-league-tv-packages|title=ESPN snaps up Premier League TV packages|work=[[ESPNsoccernet]]|date=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2012, the network had begun to lose many of its key sports rights, including the Premier League, to [[BT Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18430036|title=Premier League rights sold to BT and BSkyB for £3bn|work=BBC News|date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a405472/bt-poaches-premiership-rugby-rights-from-espn-sky.html|title=BT poaches Premiership Rugby rights from ESPN, Sky|work=Digital Spy|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a436090/bt-deals-further-blow-to-espn-with-new-rights-deals.html|title=BT deals further blow to ESPN with new rights deals|work=Digital Spy|date=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 25, 2013, ESPN reached a deal to sell its television business in the United Kingdom and Ireland, including ESPN America's programming rights, to BT Group. The ESPN channel in the United Kingdom was placed under the control of [[BT Sport]], while [[ESPN Classic (UK)|ESPN Classic]] and ESPN America were shut down.

'''Electrochemical engineering''' is the branch of chemical engineering dealing with the technological applications of electrochemical phenomena, such as electrosynthesis of chemicals, [[electrowinning]] and refining of metals,  flow batteries and [[fuel cells]], surface modification by electrodeposition, electrochemical separations and corrosion. This discipline is an overlap between [[electrochemistry]] and [[chemical engineering]].

According with the [[IUPAC]], the term ''electrochemical engineering'' is reserved for electricity intensive processes for industrial or energy storage applications, and should not be confused with ''applied electrochemistry'', which comprises small batteries, amperometric sensors, microfluidic devices, microelectrodes, solid-state devices, voltammetry at disc electrodes, etc. 

More than 6% of the electricity is consumed by large-scale electrochemical operations in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bebelis|first1=S.|last2=Bouzek|first2=K.|last3=Cornell|first3=A.|last4=Ferreira|first4=M.G.S.|last5=Kelsall|first5=G.H.|last6=Lapicque|first6=F.|last7=Ponce de León|first7=C.|last8=Rodrigo|first8=M.A.|last9=Walsh|first9=F.C.|title=Highlights during the development of electrochemical engineering|journal=Chemical Engineering Research and Design|date=October 2013|volume=91|issue=10|pages=1998–2020|doi=10.1016/j.cherd.2013.08.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
[[File:Electrochemical engineering (corrected).jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|This diagram shows the relationship between electrochemical engineering and other disciplines.]]

Electrochemical engineering combines the study of heterogeneous charge transfer at electrode/electrolyte interphases with the development of practical materials and processes. Fundamental  considerations include electrode materials and the kinetics of redox species. The development of the technology involves the study of the electrochemical reactors, their potential and current distribution, mass transport conditions, hydrodynamics, geometry and components as well as the quantification of its overall performance in terms of reaction yield, conversion efficiency, and energy efficiency. Industrial developments require further reactor and process design, fabrication methods, testing and product development.

Electrochemical engineering considers current distribution, fluid flow, mass transfer, and the kinetics of the electro reactions in order to design efficient electrochemical reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newman|first1=John|title=Engineering design of electrochemical systems|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry|date=1968|volume=60|issue=4|pages=12–27|doi=10.1021/ie50700a005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most electrochemical operations are performed in filter-press reactors with parallel plate electrodes or, less often, in stirred tanks with rotating cylinder electrodes. Fuel cell and flow battery stacks are types of filter-press reactors. Most of them are continuous operations.

==History==
[[File:Cell room of a chlorine-caustic soda plant.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Cell room of a chlor-alkali plant ca. 1920]]

This branch of engineering emerged gradually from chemical engineering as electrical power sources became available in the mid 19th century. [[Michael Faraday]] described his laws of electrolysis in 1833, relating for the first time the amount of electrical charge and converted mass. In 1886 [[Charles Martin Hall]] developed a cheap electrochemical process for the extraction of aluminium from its ore in molten salts, constituting the first true large-scale electrochemical industry. Later, [[Hamilton Castner]] improved the process aluminium manufacturing and devised the electrolysis of brine in large mercury cells for the production of chlorine and caustic soda, effectively founding the chlor-alkali industry with Karl Kellner in 1892. The next year, Paul L. Hulin patented filter-press type electrochemical cells in France. [[Charles Frederick Burgess]] developed the electrolytic refining of iron ca. 1904 and later ran a successful battery company. Burgess published one of the first texts on the field in 1920. During the first three decades of the 20th century, industrial electrochemistry followed an empirical approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Electrochemistry Books Published Before 1950|url=http://knowledge.electrochem.org/estir/old-books.htm|publisher=The Electrochemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the Second World War, interest focused towards the fundaments of electrochemical reactions. Among other developments, the [[potentiostat]] (1937) enabled such studies. A critical advance was provided by the work of [[Carl Wagner]] and [[Veniamin Levich]] in 1962 who linked the hydrodynamics of a flowing electrolyte towards a rotating disc electrode with the mass transport control of the electrochemical reaction through a rigorous mathematical treatment. The same year, Wagner described for the first time "The Scope of Electrochemical Engineering" as a separated discipline from a physicochemical perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wagner|first1=C.|title=The scope of electrochemical engineering|journal=Advances in Electrochemistry and Electrochemical Engineering|volume=2|year=1962|pages=1-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 60s and 70s Charles W. Tobias, who is regarded as the "father of electrochemical engineering" by the [[Electrochemical Society]], was concerned with ionic transport by diffusion, migration, and convection, exact solutions of potential and current distribution problems, conductance in heterogeneous media, quantitative description of processes in porous electrodes. Also in the 60s, [[John Newman (scientist)|John Newman]] pioneered the study of many of the physicochemical laws that govern electrochemical systems, demonstrating how complex electrochemical processes could be analysed mathematically to correctly formulate and solve problems associated with batteries, fuel cells, electrolyzers and related technologies. In Switzerland, Norbert Ibl contributed with experimental and theoretical studies of mass transfer and potential distribution in electrolyses, especially at porous electrodes. Fumio Hine carried out equivalent developments in Japan. Several individuals, including Kuhn, Kreysa, Rousar, Fleischmann, Alkire, Coeuret, Pletcher and Walsh established many other training centers and, with their colleagues, developed important experimental and theoretical methods of study. Currently, the main tasks of electrochemical engineering consist in the development of efficient, safe and sustainable technologies for the production of chemicals, metal recovery, remediation and decontamination technologies as well as the design of fuel cells, flow batteries and industrial electrochemical reactors.

The history of electrochemical engineering has been summarised by Wendt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wendt|first1=H.|last2=Kreysa|first2=G.|title=The Scope and History of Electrochemical Engineering|journal=Electrochemical Engineering|pages=1-7|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-03851-2_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lapicque,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lapicque|first1=F.|title=Electrochemical Engineering: An Overview of its Contributions and Promising Features|journal=Chemical Engineering Research and Design|date=2004|volume=82|issue=12|pages=1571–1574|doi=10.1205/cerd.82.12.1571.58046}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stankovic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stankovic|first1=V.|title=Electrochemical Engineering - its appearance, evolution and present status.

==Applications==

Electrochemical engineering is applied in industrial [[water electrolysis]], [[electrolysis]], electrosynthesis, electroplating, [[fuel cells]], [[flow batteries]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arenas|first1=L.F.|last2=Ponce de León|first2=C.|last3=Walsh|first3=F.C.|title=Engineering aspects of the design, construction and performance of modular redox flow batteries for energy storage|journal=Journal of Energy Storage|date=June 2017|volume=11|pages=119–153|doi=10.1016/j.est.2017.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; decontamination of industrial effluents, electrorefining, electrowinning, etc. The main example of an electrolysis based process is the [[Chloralkali process]] for production of caustic soda and chlorine. Other inorganic chemicals produced by electrolysis include:

* [[Chlorine]]

The '''EnergyGuide''' provides consumers in the United States information about the energy consumption, efficiency, and operating costs of appliances and consumer products. Clothes washers, dishwashers, refrigerators, freezers, televisions, water heaters, window air conditioners, mini split air conditioners,  central air conditioners, furnaces, boilers, heat pumps, and other electronic appliances are all required to have EnergyGuide labels.&lt;ref name=ftcfaq&gt;{{cite web|title=Shopping for Home Appliances?

Appliance energy labeling was mandated by the [[Energy Policy and Conservation Act]] of 1975, which directed the [[Federal Trade Commission]] to "develop and administer a mandatory energy labeling program covering major appliances, equipment, and lighting."&lt;ref name=aceee&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaidyanathan|first=Shruti|title=Overcoming Market Barriers and Using Market  Forces to Advance Energy Efficiency|year=2013|publisher=American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy|location=Washington, DC|url=http://www.cdfa.net/cdfa/cdfaweb.nsf/ord/aceeedc-barriers-forces-ee-report.html/$file/e136.pdf|author2=Nadel, Steven |author3=Amann, Jennifer |author4=Bell, Casey J. |author5=Chittum, Anna |author6=Farley, Kate |author7=Hayes, Sara |author8=Vigen, Michelle |author9= Young, Rachel  |accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first appliance labeling rule was established in 1979 and all products were required to carry the label starting in 1980.

[[Energy Star]] is a similar labeling program, but requires more stringent efficiency standards for an appliance to become qualified, and is not a required program, but rather a voluntary one.

EurOMA places a key focus for development and application of knowledge; excellence in manufacturing and service operations must be led by the development of new knowledge. The Association provides such a focus for identifying and disseminating the latest thinking and research as well as for exploring current issues in OM, thereby setting research agendas for the future.  The International Annual EurOMA Conference is a major forum for the presentation of new ideas and developments in the field.

Furthermore, EurOMA aims to support education in Operations Management by promoting a wide range of academic activities designed to advance the teaching and learning of Operations Management, including workshops, seminars, summer schools and forums.

The current EurOMA president is [http://www.dig.polimi.it/index.php?id=251 Raffaella Cagliano] of the Politecnico di Milano, who heads up the [http://www.euroma-online.org/r/default.asp?iId=GLKGM EurOMA board].

==Origins==
The Association was originally formed as a UK-based group (OMA) in 1984, and rapidly grew into Europe's leading professional association for Operations Management. The expanding European dimension led to the forming of the European Operations Management Association (EurOMA) in October 1993.  EurOMA is a professional non-profit association, and currently administered by EIASM, the [http://www.eiasm.org European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management].

==Activities==
*'''Annual conference:''' EurOMA hosts an annual conference that brings together Operations Management scholars from across the world. It also participates in joint events with its US partner organisation, the [http://www.poms.org Production and Operations Management Society] (POMS).
*'''Publications:''' The official journal of EurOMA is the [[International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management]] (IJOPM), which provides a communication medium for all those working in the operations management field, whether they work in academic institutions, in industry or in consultancy.  The content of the journal focuses on topics which have a substantial management (as opposed to technical) content.
*'''Education:''' EurOMA hosts many educational and training programs, including the EurOMA Summer School, the Annual Doctoral Workshop, and the Service Operations Management forum.
* '''Career development:''' EurOMA offers a placement service that advertises open positions to its members.

The '''Formosa Plastics Group Museum''' ({{zh|c=台塑企業文物館|p=Táisù Qǐyè Wénwùguǎn}}), located on the campus of [[Chang Gung University]], [[Guishan District]], [[Taoyuan City]], northern [[Taiwan]], was opened in 2004 to commemorate the 50th anniversary, where the history and culture of the leading Taiwanese company [[Formosa Plastics Group]] (FPG) is displayed. There are seven floors of display in the building, totaling 2,837 [[Pyeong|pings]] (9379 m²). [[Wang Yung-ching]], nicknamed ‘the God of Management’ by the Japanese, is the founder of the Formosa Plastics Group (FPG), and two floors of museum space are dedicated to his life and the achievements of his company. FPG, with a US$60&amp;nbsp;billion revenue, contributes over 12% of [[Taiwan]]’s GDP in 2007. The company employs over 94,000 people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpg.com.tw/html/eng/annu.asp FPG&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

=== 1st floor ===
In the center of the lobby is an 8.5-ton of [[Kauri pine]], which symbolizes energy and vitality. Kauri pine in the [[Māori language]] means “lord of trees”. Together with its long life span and hardness, the Kauri echoes the same impression toward FPG held by the general public in Taiwan.
The ground floor also features the company motto, the CIS ([[corporation identification system]]), the chronology, the briefing of business sectors in which FPG is involved

=== 2nd floor ===
The second floor features wax statues and a recreation of Taiwan during [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]]. Copies of governmental approval to Formosa Plastics Company, established in 1954, are also documented. The organization chart lists the 40 subsidiaries worldwide in the conglomerate.

=== 3rd floor ===
The third floor focuses on plastics and chemical fiber sectors. The company had the smallest output in the world at first, but now serves as one of the major [[PVC]] producers worldwide.
Plastic processing machines (e.g., extruder, injection molding, and miniature calendar) and the company’s first weaving machine are exhibited. Also on display are photographs witnessing the simultaneous surges of the company development and Taiwan’s economic success.

=== 4th floor ===
The 4th floor, Exhibition of Energy and Electronics Industry, features a large 13.6m × 6.6m (45&amp;nbsp;ft × 22&amp;nbsp;ft) 1/600 [[scale model]] of FPG’s MiaoLiao Complex. Visitors will walk on the [[glass floor]] to get a [[aerial view|bird’s-eye view]] of the 26 square kilometres (6,400 acres) of [[reclaimed land]] and a man-made 6 square kilometres (1,483 acres) industrial [[harbor]]. The actual reclaimed area is 8&amp;nbsp;km long and 4&amp;nbsp;km wide. The man-made harbor has a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of 24&amp;nbsp;m (78&amp;nbsp;ft). This scale model is lit with [[optical fiber]].

With the MaiLiao Project, which includes [[oil refinery|crude oil refinery]], [[naphtha]] [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]], [[olefin]], [[aromatic compound]], and the [[downstream (manufacturing)|downstream]] chemical raw materials, FPG successfully accomplished significant [[organic growth]] and extension from plastic manufacturing to [[petrochemical]] industry.

FPG entered the electronic business by making [[printed circuit boards]] (PCB) in 1983. The exhibition also illustrates how FPG extended the backward [[vertical integration]] by adding production of [[epoxy resin]] (1985), copper-clad laminates (1986), glass [[yarn]] (1987), glass fiber (1989), copper foil (1995), [[Epichlorohydrin|ECH]] and [[Bisphenol A|BPA]] (2001). It took two decades to make the vertical integration complete from oil refinery to PCB.

The MiaoLiao project positions FPG as a major manufacturer in the [[petrochemical industry]] and PCB-related material in the world.

An {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} [[silicon]] [[ingot]], made by [[Formosa Sumco Technology Corporation]], and an 8" [[DRAM]] [[wafer]], made by [[Nanya Technology Corporation]], are on the display.

=== 5th floor ===
The fifth floor introduces the group’s overseas and affiliated companies. Among the many exhibits, models of the first chemical ship and the largest 300,000 ton-oil tanker of the [[Formosa Marine Corporation]] are displayed. There is a [[SCANIA]] tractor, which allows children to experience daily work of the drivers.
Expansion into biotechnology represents the progressive innovation of Taiwan’s oldest conglomerate.

=== 6th floor ===
Wang Yung-ching contributes to society not just financially. He founded three universities and the largest non-profit private hospital in Taiwan before 1988. A subsidiary, [[Formosa Heavy Equipment]], rebuilt 16 elementary schools after the [[921 earthquake]], the most powerful quake in Taiwan in decades. All these are presented using [[scale model]]s.

=== Basement floor ===
A briefing room shows a documentary film for FPG and a virtual re-creation of the New Zealand [[Kauri, New Zealand|Kauri]] forest.

==Transportation==
The museum is accessible within walking distance south of [[National Taiwan Sport University Station]] of [[Taoyuan Airport MRT]].

'''Grupa Azoty ATT Polymers GmbH''' (''abridged name: Grupa Azoty ATT POLYMERS'') – one of the leading enterprises producing [[Nylon 6|polyamide 6]] (PA6) in [[Western Europe]]. Acquired by [[Grupa Azoty S.A.|Zakłady Azotowe w Tarnowie-Mościcach]] in 2009, currently a member of [[Grupa Azoty S.A.|Grupa Azoty]], leader in production of [[fertilizer]]s, [[List of building materials|construction materials]] and [[caprolactam]]. Grupa Azoty ATT POLYMERS is seated in [[Guben]], ([[Germany]]).

The company has its own laboratory and cooperates with a modern laboratory of the Grupa Azoty located in [[Tarnów]]. Its activity is focused on both development of existing products as well as on [[research]] on new products.

== History ==

In 1958, the authorities of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] decided to increase the volume of national production of [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic fibres]]. The main element of that plan was construction of the chemical complex in Guben. The first facilities of Chemiefaserwerk Guben were constructed in 1960 in the place of former arms factories Rheinmetall-Borsig; whereas in 1964, the trial production was commenced. In 1968, polyamide 6 was produced for the first time, which was used to produce carpet yarn. In years 1979–1980 the production possibilities were expanded within the field of PA6.

Upon [[German reunification]], the plants operated under the name of Chemiefaserwerk Guben GmbH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://museen.de/chemiefaserwerk-guben.html |title = Chemiefaserwerk |accessdate = 2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of multiple ownership changes in 1998, the company Plastomid Polymere GmbH was founded, which was a specialist in polyamide 6 production (20 thousand tons per year). Two years later, the [[Polymerisation]] reactors were modernised by their adjustment to two-stage production. Since then, in addition to new types of high-viscose granulate, it was possible to enter the foil market.
In 2005, the company changed its name to Unylon Polymers GmbH and increased the production powers to 47 thousand tons of PA6 per year.
As a result of the financial crisis, it was not possible to maintain the production profitability and bankruptcy proceedings were commenced in 2009. One of its elements was looking for an investor who would take over Unylon Polymers GmbH. In 2010, the plants were taken over in 100% by Zakłady Azotowe in Tarnów-Mościce S.A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://chemia.wnp.pl/azoty-tarnow-sa-juz-wlascicielem-niemieckiej-firmy-unylon-polymers,101754_1_0_0.html |title = Azoty Tarnów są już właścicielem niemieckiej firmy Unylon Polymers |accessdate = 2016-04-05| language = Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of a merger of two largest Polish chemical firms, the company has operated as Grupa Azoty ATT Polymers GmbH since 2013.

== Shareholding structure==

100% of shares is held by the Grupa Azoty, being the controlling shareholder of the major Polish plants of Great Chemical Synthesis ([[Zakłady Azotowe Kędzierzyn|Kędzierzyn-Koźle]], Police, [[Zakłady Azotowe Puławy|Puławy]] i [[Grupa Azoty S.A.|Tarnów]]).

== Management ==

The company is run by two managing directors: Gabriele Kell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriele-kell-6991794a |title = Gabriele Kell |accessdate = 2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jacek Dychtoń, whereas the members of the Supervisory Board are Andrzej Skolmowski, Małgorzata Malec and Witold Szczypiński.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://att.grupaazoty.com/pl/spolka/zarzadzanie |title= Zarządzanie |accessdate = 2016-04-05|language = Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==

Grupa Azoty ATT Polymers GmbH mainly specialises in polyamide 6 production. Its high viscosity allows for its application in, e.g. production of bi-oriented foil, which is used in work with foods. A product named Alphalon™ was distinguished at fairs PLASTPOL 2011 in [[Kielce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://archive-pl.com/pl/k/konstrukcjeinzynierskie.pl/2012-10-23_502433_33/Projektowanie_i_Konstrukcje_In%C5%BCynierskie/ |title = Projektowanie i Konstrukcje Inżynierskie |accessdate = 2016-04-05|language = Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The production abilities in Grupa Azoty ATT POLYMERS are estimated as 45 thousand tons per year. In 2014, Grupa Azoty gained the possibility to open the next factory of polyamide 6 in Tarnów as a part of Special Economic Zone in Kraków with production rate of 80 thousand tons per year. The synergy of these installations allows the company to produce ca. 170 thousand tons of PA6 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.chemiaibiznes.com.pl/aktualnosc/grupa-azoty-rozbudowuje-moce-produkcyjne-dla-poliamidu |title = Grupa Azoty rozbudowuje moce produkcyjne dla poliamidu |accessdate = 2016-04-05 |language = Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://krakow.wyborcza.pl/krakow/1,44425,17142807,Grupa_Azoty_kosztem_320_mln_zl_zbuduje_wytwornie_poliamidu.html?disableRedirects=true | title = Grupa Azoty kosztem 320 mln zł zbuduje wytwórnię poliamidu | accessdate = 2016-04-05 | language = Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Successes ==

In 2011, at XV International Fairs of Plastics and Rubber Processing PLASTPOL in Kielce, the company was distinguished for alphalon E36LN used to produce bi-oriented foil that can have direct contact with foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://eplastics.pl/artykuly/eplastics-news/9377/k2010-azoty-tarnow.html |title = Za Odrą jak w domu.

=== The case of the submarines ===
In 2004, Escom provides assistance to German Submarine Consortium (GSG) in defining the compensation incentives included in [[:pt:Caso dos submarinos|the sale of two submarines to Portugal]].

'''Hendrikus "Hendrik" Colijn '''(22 June 1869 – 18 September 1944) was a Dutch military officer, businessman and politician who served as [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] from 1925 to 1926 and again from 1933 to 1939.

==Early life==
He was born on 22 June 1869 in the [[Haarlemmermeer]] to Antonie Colijn and Anna Verkuijl, who had migrated to the newly created Haarlemmermeer polder from the [[Land of Heusden and Altena]] for religious reasons. He was the first of six children, all born in [[Haarlemmermeer]]. Colijn grew up in the [[Land of Altena]].

==Military service==

At the age of 16, he went to a military academy in [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]] for officer training, where he graduated as a 2nd lieutenant in 1892. On 18 September 1893, he married Helena Groenenberg (23 September 1867 – 14 February 1947).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/stamboom-de-kanter/I3715.php|title=Helena Groenenberg (1867-1947) » Stamboom De Kanter » Genealogie Online|first=C.N.|last=Cardinaal|website=Genealogie Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sent to the [[Dutch East Indies]]. During his 16 years in the Dutch East Indies, he spent ten years in the [[KNIL|Colonial Army]], serving in the [[Aceh War]] as the lieutenant of [[J. B. van Heutsz]], and six further years in the Colonial administration, having the same role towards van Heutsz when the latter became Governor General in 1904.

Colijn's letters to his wife from his period on Lombok reveal his participation in acts of brutality which by modern standards would be considered severe [[war crimes]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have seen a mother carrying a child of about 6 months old on her left arm, with a long lance in her right hand, who was running in our direction. One of our bullets killed the mother as well as the child. From now on we couldn't give any mercy, it was over. I did give orders to gather a group of 9 women and 3 children who asked for mercy and they were shot all together. It was not a pleasant job, but something else was impossible. Our soldiers tacked them with pleasure with their bayonets. It was horrible. I will stop reporting now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.iae.nl/users/arcengel/NedIndie/introengels.htm|title=Introduction to the History of the Dutch East Indies  Aad 'Arcengel' Engelfriet|first=Aad|last=Engelfriet|website=home.iae.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Political life==
After his return to the Netherlands in 1909, he was elected as an [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] Member of Parliament for the district Sneek (Before 1918, the Dutch voting system was the same as the British).

In 1911, he was appointed Minister of War&lt;ref name="age"&gt;{{cite news|title=Defense in two spheres - Holland's New Cabinet|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10973002/colijn_1939_intro/|newspaper= The Age|date=May 25, 1939|page=8|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = May 13, 2017 }} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and revised the Dutch [[Selective Service]] System. In May 1918 he acted as an intermediary between the British and [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] of Germany to arrange an armistice, resulting in the Kaiser getting refuge in The Netherlands.

==Business life==
In 1910 the Holland Dakota Landbouw Compagnie is established&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krantenbankzeeland.nl/issue/mco/1910-06-06/edition/0/page/7?query=Compagnie+van+Bet&amp;sort=relevanceKrantenbank|title=Middelburgsche Courant - 6 juni 1910 - pagina 7|website=Krantenbank Zeeland}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Hendrikus Colijn and his brother [[:nl:Arie Colijn]] as the primary share holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/6630263/_Anthonie_Colijn_1870-1932_._Boer_boerenvoorman_burgemeester_in_P.E._Werkman_en_R.E._van_der_Woude_red._Wie_in_de_politiek_gaat_is_weg_Protestantse_politici_en_de_christelijk-sociale_beweging_Hilversum_Verloren_2009_pp._151-176|title=‘Anthonie Colijn (1870-1932).

From 1914 to 1922 he served as CEO for the [[Bataafse Petroleum Maatschappij]] (BPM). In 1925, he also became CEO of [[Royal Dutch Shell]].

==Prime minister==
In 1922 he accepted the political leadership of the Anti-Revolutionary Party (Calvinist) from Dr. [[Abraham Kuyper]]. Already one year later he succeeded resigning minister [[Dirk Jan de Geer]] as [[Ministry of Finance (Netherlands)|Minister of Finance]].&lt;ref name="age" /&gt; In 1925 Colijn also became prime minister,&lt;ref name="age" /&gt; but a year later Colijn had to step down when the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] accepted a resolution by [[Gerrit Hendrik Kersten]] of the Protestant [[Reformed Political Party]] which called for diplomatic ties with the Vatican to be broken. This was unacceptable to the [[Roman Catholic State Party]] then in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [https://www.trouw.nl/home/vaticaan-moet-plaats-kennen~a203384d/ Vaticaan moet plaats kennen]; by [[Lousewies van der Laan]], [[Elly Plooij-van Gorsel]] and {{ill|Joke Swiebel|nl}}, ''[[Trouw]]'', 18 November 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Colijn then returned to the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]], and from 1927 to 1929, he served as head of the Dutch delegation to the [[League of Nations]] in Geneva. At the [[Dutch general election, 1929|elections of 1929]] he was elected for the House of Representatives, and immediately became [[Parliamentary leader]] of his party. This proved to be a success: at the [[Dutch general election, 1933|elections of 1933]] the ARP gained two seats, and Colijn became Prime Minister again.&lt;ref name="age" /&gt; From 1933&amp;ndash;1939 he served four more times as prime minister. During the 1930s his government faced the effects of the [[Great Depression in the Netherlands|Great Depression]], which took a heavy toll on the Netherlands. Colijn's government responded to the economic crisis with a very strict fiscal policy, which may have further weakened the Dutch economy. Colijn's decision to adhere to the [[Gold Standard]] until 1937, long after most of the trading partners of the Netherlands had dropped it, also played a role in lengthening the economic crisis. In 1939, his latest cabinet, with Protestant and liberal ministers but without Catholic ministers, lasted only three days before a government crisis.

==World War II and death==
After the Dutch defeat in the [[Battle of the Netherlands]] in 1940, he published an essay entitled "On the Border of Two Worlds",&lt;ref&gt;[http://resources21.kb.nl/gvn/EVDO02/pdf/EVDO02_NIOD05_0817.pdf DE GRENS V A N TWEE WERELDEN]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he called for accepting German leadership in Europe, immediately after the Royal House had fled to England, leaving him behind. His view was influenced by the tremendous show of force the German blitzkrieg had shown and the relative weakness of the Allied forces. Soon thereafter, he tried to organize political resistance but was arrested in June 1941 and taken to [[Berlin]] for interrogation. The Germans tried to have him confess that he had conspired with the British to invade the Netherlands to serve as an excuse for the German invasion.

Late in the war after the tide had turned against the Germans, according to a grandson, Himmler wanted to keep Colijn available as a possible intermediary with the British, as he had done earlier for [[Wilhelm II]]. The very fact that the [[Gestapo]] allowed the visit suggests that Himmler was already making contingency plans in case of a German loss. In March 1943 Colijn was put under house arrest in a remote mountain hotel in Ilmenau, where he died on 18 September 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlement.com/id/vg09lkz7m8z5/h_hendrik_colijn%7CParliamentary|title=Dr. H.

'''Humanistic capitalism''' is a concept that seeks to marry [[humanism]], specifically the safety and health needs of people and the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], with an embrace of market forces and a [[market-based economy]].

[[Muhammad Yunus]] describes Humanistic Capitalism as a socially conscious business world where investors are content to recoup their investments but do not expect additional dividends. [http://www.alliancemagazine.org/online/html/aojun07e.html]
The idea of humanistic capitalism is linked with the idea that fundamental changes must take place in [[economics]] today, as humanistic capitalism requires that there be a blending of the [[non-profit]] and [[for-profit]] sectors. If investors can accept the decrease in financial returns for those on a social level, humanistic capitalism will become a successful force in driving [[economic]] and [[social change]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Philanthropy]] is a fundamental concept to humanistic capitalism. While the idea of humanistic capitalism is still growing, over “72% percent of social entrepreneurs say that raising money is a problem,” and fundraising is a major issue to social entrepreneurs, who rely on [[philanthropy]] for support and funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliancemagazine.org/online/html/aojun07e.html Caroline Hartnell]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Businesses today==
There are also many businesses today that already combine the needs of the environment with the needs of people and the environment. SustainAbility,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sustainability.com/&lt;/ref&gt; a company established in 1987, defines their purpose as to “seek solutions to social and environmental challenges that deliver long term value,” and has worked on projects to “identify opportunities to innovate products and services with a reduced [[environmental footprint]].” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainability.com/consultingservices/clientexperience.asp?id=1046 Client Case Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

JEP Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanisticcapitalism.com/ JEP Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; promotes the philosophies of Humanistic Capitalism to create a kinder, gentler economic approach. The principles of Just Enough Profit (JEP) are used by companies to define what they stand for, how they treat their customers and employees, and how they serve humanity.

==Other views==
In Willis Harman's seminal paper "Humanistic Capitalism: Another Alternative" (Journal of Humanistic Psychology, Vol. 14, No. 1, Winter 1974) he writes "...corporations [must] assume an active responsibility for creating a healthy society and a habitable planet&amp;mdash;not as a gesture to improve corporate image or as a moralistically undertaken responsibility, but because it is the only reasonable long-run interpretation of "good business." In the end, good business policy must become one with good social policy."

Ira Rohter, a professor in the Political Science Department at the [[University of Hawaii]], promoted Humanistic Capitalism as a way to restore power to the people of [[Hawaii]] and their environment. He advocated that all growth be [[sustainable]], [[self-reliant]], and not only focused on profit, but the needs of people. Another key concept of humanistic capitalism, he added, is a [[democracy|democratic]] economy way based on “cooperation [and] openness” in order to meet the needs of Hawaii’s people and environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hawaii.edu/~irohter/AlternativeEconomyArticle.htm Ira Rohter]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7988">[[File:Localizaciones España Almería.svg|thumb|300px|Location of the province of Almeria (Spain).]]
The [[intensive agriculture]] of the [[province of Almeria]], [[Spain]], is a model of agricultural exploitation of high technical and economic yield based on the rational use of water, sanding, use of plastic [[greenhouse]]s, high technical training and high level of employment of Inputs, on the peculiar characteristics of the environment.

Although this area of Spain is sometimes known as the “market garden” of Europe, it is responsible for the hidden practice of the slave labour of thousands of migrant African migrant workers.

Another unknown fact is that for many years the discarded  plastic sheeting from the hundreds of square kilometres of greenhouses has been dumped on adjacent land. This plastic slowly breaks down into minute particles and ends up in the Mediterranean where it pollutes the waters and aquatic life and ironically gets into the human food chain.

==History==
[[File:Almeria-Invernaderos.jpg|thumb|300px|''Campo de Dalías'' satellite image and its "plastic sea" formed by greenhouses.]]
The first greenhouse was built in 1963 and the technique was extended by the ''Campo de Dalías'' or ''Poniente Almeriense'' and later by the ''Campo de Níjar'', in the east. The use of [[polyethylene]] as a substitute for glass had already been tested in the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Catalonia]] before. The plastic was spread over wooden posts or metal structures and secured by wire. The transparent plastic intensifies the heat and maintains the humidity. This allows harvests to be harvested one month earlier than in the open field and more ahead than in other regions, starting harvesting in December and allowing the plant growth of the autumn-winter plantings until March, doubling and sometimes tripling the number of harvests.

===Commercial evolution===
In February 2010 a new certification regulation of the N brand of [[AENOR]] for fruits and vegetables for fresh consumption came into force. This regulation describes the control system of the [[ISO]] 155 standard. This mark guarantees to customers that the products comply with quality protocols that include good agricultural practices, respect for the environment, traceability and social measures. The fulfillment of the norm covers almost all the requirements that the great European distribution demands to the producers of fruits and vegetables. These standards are homologated with the [[GLOBALGAP]] protocol.&lt;ref&gt;Diario La Voz de Almería: “Entra en vigor un nuevo reglamento de certificación”, Redaction, February 7, 2010, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data from EXTENDA (Andalusian Agency for Foreign Promotion), the value of exports of fruit and vegetables in 2012 amounted to 1,914.1 million euros, a growth of 9.7% compared to 2011. Fresh vegetables and vegetables contributed 1,665.5 million. There were 359 exporting companies, 222 regular. These sales accounted for 47.3% of the total of the autonomous community. Among the client countries are Germany, 29.7% of the total, France, 15%, the Netherlands, 13.1%, the United Kingdom, 11.3%, and Italy, 7.2%. They are followed by Poland, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark and Portugal. According to the same source, in the first six months of 2013 sales totaled 1,600 million euros, 14.6% more than the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Diario La Voz de Almería: “Almería suma la mitad de exportaciones andaluzas de frutas y hortalizas frescas”, by Antonio Fernández, August 26, 2013, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Between January and October 2013, the province exported more than 12.8 million kilos of live plants and cut flowers, 18.4% more than in the same period of 2012. The turnover amounted to almost 18.7 million euros, 56% more. Exports of ornamental plants accounted for more than 17.8 million euros, an increase of 59% over the same period in 2012. The main buyers are France, with 59.6% of the plants, Germany, with a 14.2%, and the Netherlands, with 10.6%. They are followed by Belgium, Portugal, Italy, United Kingdom, United States and Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;Diario La Voz de Almería: “Francia y Holanda, principales clientes de plantas ornamentales”, Redaction, January 13, 2014, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The specialization of farmers by a single product is increasingly observed, as is the concentration of gender marketing in a few large firms. The largest companies such as Agroponiente, Unica Group, CASI, Alhóndiga La Unión, Agroiris and Vicasol account for 35% of the market share in 2015.

==Integrated pest control==
In agriculture, integrated pest management (IPM) or integrated pest control (IPC) is understood as a strategy that uses a variety of complementary methods: physical, mechanical, chemical, biological, genetic, legal and cultural for control of pests. These methods are applied in three stages: prevention, observation and application. It is an ecological method that aims to reduce or eliminate the use of pesticides and minimize the impact on the environment. There is also talk about ecological pest management (EPM) and natural pest management.&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency, "Pesticides and Food: What Integrated Pest Management Means."&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 2015, 60% of the area devoted to horticultural crops in the province used biological pest control techniques. The percentages are higher in some fundamental crops like pepper, 100%, and tomato, 85%. In all, some 26600 hectares of protected horticulture use these techniques, when in 2006 they were only used in about 129.

The Regional Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of the Andalusian Government is launching a plan (Compromiso Verde or Green Commitment) in 2016 to expand the area to 100%. For the Regional Government, this is the model that should extend the distances with traditional crops and leave a definitive patent that Almeria produces with more quality, more traceability and more food security than any:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...guarantees the quality and improves the positioning of our products in international markets, increases the profitability of farms, enhances respect for the environment and minimizes the presence of insect vectors of viruses and favors the correct management of pests." (Carmen Ortiz Rivas, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Waste===
Analyzes of horticultural products indicate that only 0,6% of the samples show pesticide residues, when the European average is 2,8% (five times more).&lt;ref&gt;Diario La Voz de Almería: La Junta se marca el objetivo llegar al 100% de control biológico en Almería, por Antonio Fernández, de 9 de enero de 2016, pág. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseantonioarcos.es/2016/01/08/compromiso-verde-en-almeria/ José Antonio Arcos: Las hortalizas almerienses respetan más los LMRs que las europeas, de 8 de enero de 2016], consulted on February 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
Plastic waste from the greenhouses is reported to run off into the mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/08/spain-sperm-whale-death-swallowed-plastic Spanish sperm whale death linked to UK supermarket supplier's plastic]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ecowatch.com/europes-dirty-little-secret-moroccan-slaves-and-a-sea-of-plastic-1882131257.html Europe's Dirty Little Secret]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubin was awarded the Chamber's commerce award on six occasions for his contributions to the overall commercial relationship between Mexico and the US.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

He also represents the [[Republican Party (United States)|US Republican Party]] in Mexico.

In 2007, Rubin made public a survey of the Mexican public, which concluded that Mexico was one of the top nations for breach of copyright and trademark. He said that U.S. business was being hurt by the lack of enforcement in Mexico of [[intellectual property rights]] (IPR).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=piracy in informal markets|date=November 30, 2007|work=Reforma|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy reform ===
As President of the American Society, Rubin argued for [[energy]] reform in Mexico, saying that oil prices would raise and thousands of jobs were threatened. Working together with a number of energy companies from the U.S. he was able to give specific recommendations to government. Energy reform was thus enacted in Mexico, benefiting many U.S. businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/economia/reforma-energetica-mitigara-impacto-de-petroprecios-larry-rubin.html|title=Reforma energética mitigará impacto de petroprecios: Larry Rubin|website=www.elfinanciero.com.mx|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/empresas/mexico-tardara-10-anos-en-formar-talento-para-el-sector-energetico-rubin.html|title=México tardará 10 años en formar talento para el sector energético: Rubin|website=www.elfinanciero.com.mx|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Daish was born in [[Wellington]], New Zealand and grew up in the suburb of [[Roseneath, Wellington|Roseneath.]] While young, her family moved to New York for two years as her father had a job at the United Nations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/the-wellingtonian/3119501/The-Wellingtonian-interview-Lois-Daish|title=The Wellingtonian interview: Lois Daish|last=Romanos|first=Joseph|date=3 December 2009|newspaper=Stuff.co.nz|language=English|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early exposure to American food influenced her interest and taste in food in later years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 1960s, Daish cooked at the [[Downstage Theatre]], and later worked at a bohemian cafe, The Settlement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the 1970s, Daish wrote articles for a friend's newspaper in the western suburbs of Wellington; most were on town planning issues, but Daish convinced her friend to include a food column and she wrote food articles for the newspaper as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the 1980s, Daish owned several Wellington restaurants: Number 9 on Bowen St for four years, followed by the Mount Cook Café from 1984 to 1989, and then the Brooklyn Café &amp; Grill.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1984 she began writing a food column for the ''[[New Zealand Listener]]'' magazine. For the first ten years she wrote alternate weeks with [[Annabel Langbein]], and from 1994 she wrote the column every week.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pageandblackmore.co.nz/product/62996-NZListenerAGoodYear-9781869416904|title=NZ Listener: A Good Year by Lois Daish {{!}} Page &amp; Blackmore Booksellers|last=CircleSoft|website=Page &amp; Blackmore Booksellers|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She retired from the ''Listener'' in 2009.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.womensweekly.co.nz/latest/celebrity/nici-wickes-an-afternoon-with-my-hero-18782|title=Nici Wickes: An afternoon with my hero|newspaper=New Zealand Women’s Weekly|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, she was a founding member of the New Zealand Guild of Food Writers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=25731|title=Wellington.scoop.co.nz » New Zealand food writers honour Lois Daish|website=wellington.scoop.co.nz|language=en|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Kevin O'Leary''' (born 20 March 1961) is an Irish businessman and the Chief Executive Officer of [[Ryanair]]. He is one of Ireland's wealthiest businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/specials/rich_list/|title=Rich list | work=The Times | location=London | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Michael O'Leary was born 20 March 1961, the second in a family of six, in [[Kanturk]] in [[County Cork]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=48721542211 |title=Information on "Facebook" |publisher=Facebook.com |date=20 March 1961 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{disputed inline|date=July 2017}} He was educated at [[Clongowes Wood College]], [[County Kildare]]. In 1979, he began a four-year Bachelor in Economic and Social Studies programme at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. He graduated from Trinity in 1983 and then worked as a trainee with Stokes Kennedy Crowley (later known as [[KPMG]]), studying the Irish tax system. He left after two years in 1985, setting up profitable newsagents in [[Walkinstown]] and [[Terenure]], Dublin.

While at Stokes Kennedy Crowley, O'Leary had met [[Tony Ryan]], head of [[Guinness Peat Aviation]], a leasing company (GPA). Ryan was one of KPMG's clients and O'Leary advised Ryan on his personal income tax affairs. In 1987, Ryan hired O'Leary as his personal financial and tax advisor, where Ryan's main interest was in GPA. [[Ryanair]] was established around this time and originally followed a traditional business model, but quickly began to lose money. Subsequently O'Leary was sent to the USA to study the novel [[Southwest Airlines]] business model. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Ryanair career==
Under O'Leary's management, Ryanair further developed the [[low-cost carrier|low-cost model]] originated by [[Southwest Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matthew Maier, Business 2.0 Magazine staff writer |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/04/01/8372814/index.htm |title=A radical Fix for Airlines: Make Flying Free, '&amp;#39;'Forbes'&amp;#39;', 1 April 2006 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=31 March 2006 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Leary may have described the inauguration of the ancillary revenue movement during a 2001 interview in ''[[The Sunday Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Flying for Free on Ryanair", 13 May 2001, BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; "The other airlines are asking how they can put up fares. We are asking how we could get rid of them." 

The business model envisioned by O'Leary uses receipts from on board shopping, internet gaming, car hire and hotel bookings to replace the ticket revenue from selling airline seats. Savings are also made by negotiating discounts with airports for reduced landing fees. In many cases, regional airports have made no charges so as to secure flights that bring passengers and wealth into their area.

The deregulation of Ireland's major airports and a transformation of traditional full-service airlines are among his demands.&lt;ref name="rteeamon"&gt;RTÉ radio 10 February 2007, in "Conversations with Eamon Dunphy"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishpost.co.uk/news/story.asp?j=5286&amp;cat=news Irish Post: Ryanair chief hints of possible departure&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928014654/http://www.irishpost.co.uk/news/story.asp?j=5286&amp;cat=news |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, O'Leary unveiled plans to develop a ''Ryanair [[Israel]]'' to operate extensive flights to and from Israel and a large network of European cities. The plans include the establishment of a large hub in Israel.&lt;ref name="RyanairIsrael"&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli market beckons Ryanair|url=http://www.irishsun.com/index.php/sid/225083355|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=25 August 2014|publisher=''Irish Sun.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and reputation==
O'Leary has a reputation for loose talk in the airline industry and among its regulators. Many press articles have often described him as arrogant, and prone to making comments which he later contradicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ZEIT ONLINE GmbH, Hamburg, Germany |url=http://www.zeit.de/2004/29/Monti-Amt?page=4 |title=Die Festung wankt: Europas mächtige Wettbewerbshüter verurteilen Microsoft und stoppen Fusionen.

In 2007, he was forced to retract a claim that Ryanair had cut emissions of carbon dioxide by half over the previous five years; the claim should have been that emissions 'per passenger' had been cut by half.&lt;ref&gt;“Ryanair retracts emissions claim”, 29 January 2007, at [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6310571.stm  news.bbc.co.uk]; last accessed 19 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Leary has been reported to have impersonated a journalist in an attempt to find information passed on to a newspaper following a safety incident on a Ryanair flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duggan |first=Barry |url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&amp;si=498833&amp;issue_id=5125 |title=Ryanair staff were menacing: passenger – National News, Frontpage – Independent.ie |publisher=Unison.ie |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=2011-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108154700/http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&amp;si=498833&amp;issue_id=5125 |archivedate=8 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion he has apologised for personal attacks under threat of legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0508/1224269952195.html |title=Sat, May 08, 2010 – O'Leary in court apology to union official |publisher=The Irish Times |date=5 May 2010 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has been criticized by a judge for lying, who said he was lucky not to be found guilty of contempt of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0326/ryanair.html |title=Judge criticises Michael O'Leary for lying – RTÉ News |publisher=RTÉ.ie |date=26 March 2010 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, he called concerns about climate change "complete nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;See: [https://fd.nl/ondernemen/1196165/topman-ryanair-zorg-over-klimaatverandering-is-complete-onzin?s_cid=671 Topman Ryanair: Zorg over klimaatverandering is 'complete onzin'], Financieel Dagblad (a Dutch financial newspaper), 10 April 2017. Accessed on 10 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press conference discussing Ryanair's planned intercontinental service [[RyanAtlantic]], O'Leary jokingly described the airline's planned business class travel experience as featuring "whores and rum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=b5e_1214473286 |title=Free Oral Sex to Business Class Customers on Ryanair says CEO |publisher=LiveLeak.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 he said that his company is against any long-haul transatlantic services, stating that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The low-cost model only really works for short-haul flights [...] If we started flying farther afield, we'd have to do something stupid like introducing what I call a 'rich class' to make it pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/723867/Eindhoven-haven't-you-always-wanted-to-go.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Eindhoven: haven't you always wanted to go? | first=Adrian | last=Bridge | date=2 April 2002 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, more than a decade later, in 2013 he said, while at the [[Paris Air Show]], that he wanted to sell cheap flights from the U.S. to Europe for as low as 10 euros ($13) or $10, if conditions were right. He said that he needed a fleet of at least 30 twin-aisle aircraft and access to ports (e.g. major U.S. and European cities, in the airline industry there are so called slots or sometimes gates, often regulated by law, and without obtaining them it is impossible to have regular service to airports). Despite his claims in 2002, there were so called budget airliners in the past – for example [[Laker Airways]] flights from London to New York in the late 1970s or long-hauls at budget-fares on other continents like AirAsiaX in Malaysia and the Australian Jetstar Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ryanair-wants-launch-flights-between-us-europe-aims-jump-growth-rate-will-return-13-billion-1315549|title=Ryanair Wants To Launch Flights Between US And Europe, Aims For Jump In Growth Rate And Will Return $1.3 Billion To Shareholders: CEO Michael O’Leary|author=Nat Rudarakanchana|date=20 June 2013|work=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reacting to the decision to close European airspace in April 2010 over worries about the [[Volcanic ash|ash]] plume from [[2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull|an erupting Icelandic volcano]] he said "there was no ash cloud. It was mythical. It's become evident the airspace closure was completely unnecessary." One study concluded that serious structural damage to aircraft could have occurred if passenger planes had continued to fly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Connor |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/steve-connor-airspace-closure-due-to-ash-cloud-fears-was-right-move-2629069.html |title=Steve Connor: Airspace closure due to ash cloud fears 'was right move' – Analysis, Opinion |publisher=Independent.ie |date= 26 April 2011|accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists and the industry as a whole remain unconvinced, however.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

In May 2014 O'Leary was highly critical of a 24-hour strike by [[Aer Lingus]] [[Flight attendant|cabin crew]], staged on 30 May 2014. Aer Lingus, whose biggest shareholder at the time was O'Leary's company Ryanair, had to cancel 200 flights and disrupt travel plans for 200,000 people. O'Leary accused Aer Lingus of "mismanagement" of its employee relations, called for the sacking of a board member, and said the striking employees should be punished by having their discount travel incentives withdrawn for a year.&lt;ref name="AerLingus"&gt;{{cite news|title=Striking Aer Lingus cabin crew should be punished says airline shareholder|url=http://www.irishsun.com/index.php/sid/222467203/scat/aba4168066a10b8d/ht/Striking-Aer-Lingus-cabin-crew-should-be-punished-says-airline-shareholder|accessdate=31 May 2014|publisher=Irish Sun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Bilderberg Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bilderbergmeetings.org/participants2015.html|title=Participants - Bilderberg Meetings|work=bilderbergmeetings.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Leary was to attend the [[Bilderberg Group]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Secretive in Telfs-Buchen, Austria 11-14 in June this year|url=http://bilderbergmeetings.org/meeting_2015.html|work=bilderbergmeetings.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ryanair chief asked to join select conference reputed to truly govern international affairs|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/secretive-bilderberg-group-sets-sights-on-michael-o-leary-1.2119343|date=27 February 2015|accessdate=27 February 2015|first=Arthur|last=Beesley|publisher=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, he was offered the opportunity to buy a stake in the club but believed the potential benefits did not outweigh the risk and preferred to visit England to watch a few matches each season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ryanair snubs €25m Man Utd shirt deal offer |url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/ryanair-snubs-25m-man-utd-shirt-deal-offer-26782581.html |work=independent.ie |date=16 October 2011 |accessdate=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notably wore a Manchester City shirt when unveiling Ryanair's new destinations to and from Manchester Airport in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary announces 26 routes from Manchester Airport which could create up to 2,000 jobs |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/s/1426482_ryanair-chief-michael-oleary-announces-26-routes-from-manchester-airport-which-could-create-up-to-2000-jobs |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=12 July 2011 |accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015 he revealed in an interview in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' that he was offered and turned down, for family reasons, the starring role in ''[[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' reality game show before it was offered to and accepted by [[Alan Sugar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.evoke.ie/showbiz/michael-oleary-apprentice-star-rejection/|work=evoke.ie | title= Big softie!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6459">'''Milo Duçi''' (1870–1933) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] publisher, playwright, and entrepreneur. Born in [[Korçë]] (then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]), he lived for most of his life in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Elsie1"&gt;{{citation|pages=125–126|author=Robert Elsie|series=Historical Dictionaries of Europe| volume=75|title =Historical Dictionary of Albania|edition=2|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-8108-6188-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his uncle [[Loni Logori]] he succeeded as an entrepreneur and distinguished activist of the [[Albanians in Egypt|Albanian community in Egypt]].

Duçi, son of a powerful [[Cotton|cotton merchant]] from Korçë,&lt;ref name="Blumi2"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nTKaAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg= |page=84| author=Isa Blumi|title=Ottoman Refugees, 1878-1939: Migration in a Post-Imperial World|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic| year=2013 | location=London | isbn=9781472515360  |oclc=830369887 }}&lt;/ref&gt; settled in Egypt at the age of 23&lt;ref name="Asllani"&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.albeu.com/opinion/shqiptaret-e-egjiptit-dhe-veprimtaria-atdhetare-e-tyre/1538/| language=Albanian|title=Shqiptarët e egjiptit dhe veprimtaria atdhetare e tyre|trans-title=Albanians of Egypt and their patriotic activity|author=Uran Asllani|publisher=Gazeta Metropol| date=2006-06-05| quote=&lt;br&gt;Po në atë vit, Thoma Avrami dhe Milo Duçi, botuan gazetën e dytë shqiptare, me titull «Besa- besë».&lt;br&gt;Atdhetari tjetër Milo Duçi, rilindas i kolonisë së Egjiptit, shkrimtar, publicist, linguist, kishte lindur me 1870 dhe shumë i ri, 23 vjeçar u vendos në Egjipt...&lt;br&gt;Më vonë në vitet 1925-1926, ai botoi të përjavëshmen « Bisedimet ».}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a merchant himself.&lt;ref name="Skendi152153"/&gt; He was one of the founders of  "Vëllazëria" (Brotherhood) society, established in 1910 in [[Cairo]], and the [[Beni Suef]] branch of it with the support of the [[Khedive]] office.&lt;ref name="Blumi2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi152153"/&gt;

Duçi also started and directed several press organs of the Albanian diaspora in Egypt, mostly short-lived. These included the magazines ''Toska'' (The [[Tosks|Tosk]]) during 1901–02, ''Besa-Besë'' (Pledge for a pledge) during 1904–05 together with [[Thoma Avrami]], ''Besa'' ([[Besa (Albanian culture)|Besa]]) of 1905 which lasted for 6 issues and was printed by Al-Tawfik in Cairo,&lt;ref name="Blumi3"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h2-sAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq= | pages=131–132| author=Isa Blumi|title=Foundations of Modernity: Human Agency and the Imperial State|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=2012|series= Routledge studies in modern history|number=9|isbn=9780415884648 |oclc=607983304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and newspapers ''Shqipëria'' (Albania) from October 1906 to February 1907, a daily of Cairo with the last two issues coming out in [[Maghagha]],&lt;ref name="Blumi3"/&gt; and the weekly ''Bisedimet'' (The discussions) of 1925–26 with 60 issues in total, which would be the last Albanian-language newspaper in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Asllani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi152153"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skendi|first=Stavro|title=The Albanian national awakening|year=1967|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8QPWCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq= |isbn=9781400847761|pages=152–153.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote several articles regarding the necessity for a unified literary [[Albanian language]] and the cultural-literary development of the Albanian society. In 1922 he established the [[publishing company]] ''Shtëpia botonjëse shqiptare/Société Albanaise d'édition'' (Albanian Publishing House).&lt;ref name="Blumi1"&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NatgAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT236&amp;lpg= | title=Reinstating the Ottomans: Alternative Balkan Modernities, 1800-1912| author=Isa Blumi|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York| year=2011|isbn=9780230110182 |oclc=669751242}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also left his footprint as a playwright; some of his [[comedy|comedies]] were ''E Thëna'' (The saying), ''Gjaku'' (The blood), ''I biri i Begut'' ([[Bey]]'s son). He also wrote short stories and poetry in the local press in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| language= Albanian| url=http://www.gazetadita.al/kush-ishte-milo-duci/|title=Kush ishte Milo Duçi?|trans-title=Who was Milo Duçi?| publisher=Gazeta Dita| date=2015-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Albanian patriotic activity, Duçi was a successful entrepreneur. His family emerged as an important player in the economic development of Egypt's Delta region directed by [[Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]]'s office. By 1901, he started working with his well-connected uncle Loni Logori on projects that explicitly tied the commercial interest of the [[UK|British]] administration and the local landowners.&lt;ref name="Blumi2"/&gt; Beside British, he openly solicited [[Austro-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] support, despite of the distrust that many [[Eastern Orthodox]] south-Albanians had for the Austrian Geo-politics. ''Toska'''s initial failure did not dissuade the Austrian authorities to support him; in 1902 they sent him 120 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|krone]] for the subscription, ordering the newspaper to be shipped to [[Vienna]] from where it would get distributed to [[Ottoman Albania]].&lt;ref name="Blumi3"/&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;Through his uncle, Duçi would also get in touch with the Albanian [[émigré]] in [[Bucharest]], [[Italy]], [[Istanbul]], and [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name="Blumi2"/&gt; The French consul in [[Shkodër]] reported that Duçi collaborated with a defrocked [[Roman Catholicism in Albania|Catholic]] priest named Gaspar Jakova Merturi who secured funds from a claimant for the Albanian throne, Prince [[Albert Ghica]] of [[Romania]]. He also collaborated closely with the [[Arberesh]] journalist [[Anselmo Lorecchio]], editor of ''[[La Nazione Albanese]]''.&lt;ref name="Blumi3"/&gt;

'''Miniaturization''' ([[British English|Br.Eng.]]: ''Miniaturisation'') is the trend to manufacture ever smaller mechanical, optical and electronic products and devices. Examples include miniaturization of [[mobile phones]], [[computers]] and vehicle [[engine downsizing]]. In [[electronics]], [[Moore's law]], which was named after Intel co-founder [[Gordon Moore]],&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Society|last=Guston|first=David|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2010|isbn=9781412969871|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; predicted that the number of [[transistors]] on an  [[integrated circuit]] for minimum component cos[[AkjsfbA,FKSNZS,;LFKJASD/;.FJAS;LDFKJUAOLSDFASF|t doubles every 18 months.]]&lt;ref name="Moore1965paper"&gt;{{cite web|year=1965 |url=ftp://download.intel.com/museum/Moores_Law/Articles-Press_Releases/Gordon_Moore_1965_Article.pdf |title=Cramming more components onto integrated circuits |format=PDF |pages=4 |publisher=[[Electronics Magazine]] |accessdate=November 11, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218224945/http://download.intel.com/museum/Moores_Law/Articles-Press_Releases/Gordon_Moore_1965_Article.pdf |archivedate=February 18, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IntelInterview"&gt;{{cite web|year=2005 |url=ftp://download.intel.com/museum/Moores_Law/Video-Transcripts/Excepts_A_Conversation_with_Gordon_Moore.pdf |title=Excerpts from A Conversation with Gordon Moore: Moore’s Law |format=PDF |pages=1 |publisher=[[Intel Corporation]] |accessdate=May 2, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029060050/http://download.intel.com/museum/Moores_Law/Video-Transcripts/Excepts_A_Conversation_with_Gordon_Moore.pdf |archivedate=October 29, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AkjsfbA,FKSNZS,;LFKJASD/;.FJAS;LDFKJUAOLSDFASF|This enables processors to be built in smaller sizes.]] 

== History ==
The history of miniaturization is associated with the history of information technology based on the succession of switching devices, each smaller, faster, cheaper than its predecessor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nanostructuring Operations in Nanoscale Science and Engineering|last=Sharma|first=Karl|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.|year=2010|isbn=9780071626095|location=New York|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period referred to as the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], miniaturization was confined to two-dimensional electronic circuits used for the manipulation of information.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Micromechanisms and Microactuators|last=Ghosh|first=Amitabha|last2=Corves|first2=Burkhard|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9788132221432|location=Heidelberg|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This orientation is demonstrated in the use of vacuum tubes in the first general-purpose computers. The technology gave way to the transistor invented in the 1950s and then the integrated circuit approach developed afterward.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Gordon Moore described the development of miniaturization in 1975 during the International Electron Devices meeting, where he confirmed his earlier prediction that silicon integrated circuit would dominate electronics, underscoring that during the period such circuits were already high-performance devices and starting to become cheaper. This was made possible by a reliable manufacturing process, which involved the fabrication in a batch process. It employed [[Photolithography|photolithographic]], mechanical, and chemical processing steps to create multiple Cheetos are the best chips in the world   transistors on a single wafer of silicon.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Moore's Law: Four Decades of Innovation|last=Brock|first=David|last2=Moore|first2=Gordon|publisher=Chemical Heritage Press|year=2006|isbn=0941901416|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure of this process was its yield, which is the ratio of working devices to those with defects and, given a satisfactory yield, a smaller transistor means that more can be on a single wafer, making each one cheaper to produce.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  

== Development ==
Miniaturization became a trend in the last fifty years and came to cover not just electronic but also mechanical devices.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science in Popular Culture: A Reference Guide|last=Van Riper|first=A. Bowdoin|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=0313318220|location=Westport, CT|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, electronic companies are producing silicon integrated circuits or chips with switching transistors that have feature size as small as 130 [[Nanometre|nanometers]] (nm) and development is also underway for chips that are merely few nanometers in size through the [[nanotechnology]] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Futuristic Materials|last=Jha|first=B.B|last2=Galgali|first2=R.K.|last3=Misra|first3=Vibhuti|publisher=Allied Publishers|year=2004|isbn=8177646168|location=New Delhi|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus is to make components smaller to increase the number that can be integrated into a single wafer and this required critical innovations, which include increasing wafer size, the development of sophisticated metal connections between the chip's circuits, and improvement in the [[Polymer|polymers]] used for masks ([[Photoresist|photoresists]]) in the [[photolithography]] processes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These last two are the areas where miniaturization has moved into the nanometer range.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  

Miniaturization in electronics is advancing rapidly due to the comparative ease in miniaturizing electrons, which are its principal moving parts. The process for mechanical devices, on the other hand, is more complex due to the way the structural properties of its parts change as they shrink.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is said that the so-called [[Digital Revolution|Third Industrial Revolution]] is based on economically viable technologies that can shrink three-dimensional objects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:NIPO Software old Logo.jpg|thumb|150px|NIPO's previous logo]]
NIPO was founded in September 1945 as the Dutch Institute for Public Opinion by Wim de Jonge and Jan Stapel. In the 1970s, some people working for NIPO, that was considered then the leading market research company in the [[Netherlands]], started developing software for data collection and analysis. In 1999 NIPO was purchased by [[Taylor Nelson Sofres]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tns-nipo.com/pages/home.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the company started developing new platform called Nfield Web &amp; Mobile which will gradually replace the current NIPO Fieldwork System.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.niposoftware.com/news/Development-of-Nfield-Web---Mobile-has-started.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2012 NIPO Software integrated the NIPO Fieldwork System with the official [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] API’s. Through this integration it became possible to invite fans on those [[Social network]] fans pages to participate in research projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niposoftware.com/news/facebook-and-twitter-triggered-online-research.aspx?year=2012 "Conduct Facebook and Twitter triggered online research", March 14, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Overtime''' is the amount of time someone works beyond ''normal working hours''. The term is also used for the pay received for this time. Normal hours may be determined in several ways:
*by custom (what is considered healthy or reasonable by society),
*by practices of a given trade or profession,
*by legislation,
*by agreement between employers and workers or their representatives.

Most nations have overtime [[labour law]]s designed to dissuade or prevent employers from forcing their employees to work excessively long hours (such as the situation in the textile mills in the 1920s). These laws may take into account other considerations than humanitarian concerns, such as preserving the health of workers so that they may continue to be productive, or increasing the overall level of employment in the economy.  One common approach to regulating overtime is to require employers to pay workers at a higher hourly rate for overtime work. Companies may choose to pay workers higher overtime pay even if not obliged to do so by law, particularly if they believe that they face a [[backward bending supply curve of labour]].

Overtime pay rates can cause workers to work longer hours than they would at a flat hourly rate.  Overtime laws, attitudes toward overtime and [[hours of work]] vary greatly from country to country and between various sectors.

==Time off in lieu==
''Time off in lieu''; ''compensatory time''; or ''comp time'' refers to a type of work schedule arrangement that allows (or requires) workers to take time off instead of, or in addition to, receiving overtime pay. A worker may receive overtime pay plus equal time off for each hour worked on certain agreed days, such as [[public holidays]].

In the United States, such arrangements are currently legal in the public sector but not in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;See 29 U.S.C. 207(o)&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, non-exempt workers must receive at least one and one half times their normal hourly wage for every hour worked beyond 40 hours in a work week. For example, workers who clock 48 hours in one week would receive the pay equivalent to 52 hours of work (40 hours + 8 hours at 1.5 times the normal hourly wage). With comp time, the worker could (or would have to) forgo the 12 hours of overtime pay and instead take 8 paid hours off at some future date.{{clarify|date=March 2012}}{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In some other jurisdictions, such as Canada, employers might be required to pay the overtime at the higher rate (e.g. 1.5 times the normal rate), but also be allowed to require time off in lieu at the '''normal''' rate. Thus, an employee might work 48 hours in one week, and 32 hours the next week (assuming over 40 hours is overtime), and be paid an extra amount equivalent to 4 hours work (8 multiplied by 0.5).

In Australia, such arrangements both in the private and public sector are common.

In some cases, particularly when employees are represented by a [[labour union]], overtime may be paid at a higher rate than 1.5 times the hourly pay. In some factories, for example, if workers are required to work on a Sunday, they may be paid twice their regular rate (i.e., "double time").

==Overtime laws by jurisdiction==

===European Union===
[[Directive (European Union)|Directives]] issued by the [[European Union]] must be incorporated into law by member states.

Directives 93/104/EC (1993), 2000/34/EC (2000), which limited working hours, were consolidated into 2003/88/EC (2003). Employers and employees can agree to opt out, under certain circumstances.

The directives require:&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32003L0088&lt;/ref&gt;
* maximum average working week (including overtime) of 48 hours over a 17-week reference period
* minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours in every 24
* breaks when the working day exceeds 6 hours
* minimum weekly rest period of 24 hours plus the 11 hours daily rest period in every 7-day period
* minimum of 4 weeks paid annual leave
* night work restricted to an average of 8 hours in any 24-hour period

The directives apply to:
*all sectors of activity, both public and private
*Doctors in training used to work a maximum week of 58 hours until 2009. From 1 August 2009 their maximum working week fell to 48 hours.

Exemptions:
* Member States of the EC may exempt: managing executives or other persons with autonomous decision-making power; family workers; and workers officiating at religious ceremonies. These are workers whose working time is not measured or pre-determined or can be determined by the workers.
* Other categories can be exempted from the directive's key provisions provided compensatory rest or appropriate protection is granted. These include employees who work a long way from home, or whose activities require a permanent presence or continuity of service or production, or who work in sectors which have peaks of activity. Examples include off-shore workers, security guards, journalists, emergency workers, agricultural workers, tour guides, etc.

===Japan===

In Japan the {{nihongo|[[Labor Standards Act of 1947|Labour Standards Act]]|労働基準法}}  of 1947 provides for an eight-hour work day and 40-hour workweek with at least one day off per week. The act requires a premium of at least 25% over the ordinary hourly wage for any overtime work, 35% for any work on prescribed off days, and an additional 25% for any work between 10 pm and 5 am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=法定労働時間と割増賃金について教えてください。|url=http://www.mhlw.go.jp/bunya/roudoukijun/faq_kijyungyosei07.html|publisher=労働基準局監督課|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers must enter into an overtime agreement with a labour representative prior to any overtime work by employees, and this agreement must stipulate to the maximum number of overtime hours that an employee may work, which may be no more than 15 hours per week, 45 hours per month and 360 hours per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=時間外労働の 限度に関する基準|url=http://www.mhlw.go.jp/new-info/kobetu/roudou/gyousei/kantoku/dl/040324-4.pdf|publisher=厚生労働省・都道府県労働局・労働基準監督署|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

====Federal overtime law====
In the United States the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938 applies to employees in industries engaged in or producing goods for interstate commerce.  The FLSA establishes a standard [[work week]] of 40 hours for certain kinds of workers, and mandates payment for overtime hours to those workers of one and one-half times the workers' normal rate of pay for any time worked above 40 hours.  

The law creates two broad categories of employees, 
* those who are "exempt" from the regulation and 
* those who are "non-exempt". 

Employers are not required to pay exempt employees overtime but must do so for non-exempt employees. 

=====Exempt=====
[[Independent contractors]] are not considered employees and therefore are not protected by the FLSA.  Several factors determine whether a worker is an employee, who might be entitled to overtime compensation, or an independent contractor, who would not be so entitled. The employment agreement stating that a party is an independent contractor does not make it necessarily so. The nature of a job determines whether an employee is entitled to overtime pay, not employment status or the field of work.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wage and Hour Division Questions and Answers|url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/flsa/faq.htm|website=United States Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes of workers who are exempt from the regulation include 
* certain types of administrative, 
* professional, and 
* executive employees. 

To qualify as an administrative, professional, or executive employee and therefore not be entitled to overtime, three tests must be passed based on salary basis, duties, and salary level. The tests vary between administrative, professional, and executive employees based on their different duties and salary levels. There are many other classes of workers who may be exempt including outside salespeople, certain agricultural employees, certain live-in employees, and certain transportation employees. Employees can neither waive their FLSA protections nor abridge them by contract.

=====USA Protections=====
An employer may not retaliate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/can_my_employer_retaiate_against_me_for_seeking_to_get_overtime|title=Can My Employer Retaliate Against Me for Seeking To Get Overtime? - findUSlaw|author=|date=|website=finduslaw.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; against an employee for filing a complaint or instituting a proceeding based on the FLSA.  An employer that engages in any form of verifiable  retaliation would be liable under the [http://finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_uscode_chapter_8#16 Fair Labor Standards Act Section 216(b)]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} for equitable relief including reinstatement, promotion, payment of lost wages, and payment of liquidated damages. Acts of retaliation include terminating employment, disrupting the workplace, threats, acts of physical violence, and constructive discharge.

=====USA statistics=====
Out of approximately 120 million American workers, nearly 50 million are exempt from overtime laws (US Department of Labor, [[Wage and Hour Division]], 1998). In 2004, the United States was 7th out of 24 [[OECD]] countries in terms of annual working hours per worker. (See [[Working time]] for a complete listing.) In 2015, the [[United States Department of Labor]] proposed dramatic changes to certain exemptions from federal minimum wage and overtime requirements. These changes are anticipated to take effect in July 2016, but as of January 2016, still are pending final approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ceglowski|first1=Kevin|title=Changes to Minimum Wage and Overtime Exemptions Expected by July 2016|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/changes-to-minimum-wage-and-overtime-exemptions-expected-july-2016|accessdate=26 January 2016|work=The National Law Review|publisher=Poyner Spruill LLP|date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed changes include: setting the minimum salary level required for exemption for full-time salaried workers at $970 per week, or $50,440 annually (an increase  from the current $455 per week, or $23,660 annually) Increasing the total annual compensation required to exempt highly compensated employees to $122,148 annually (from the current $100,000 annually).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huntington|first1=R. Calder|title=New Overtime Rules: $970 Per Week Salary Proposed For White Collar Exemptions in 2016|journal=The [[National Law Review ]]|date=30  June 2015|publisher=Holland &amp; Hart LLP|issn=2161-3362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2004, President [[George W. Bush]] and the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] proposed changes to regulations governing implementation of the law.  According to one study, the changes would have had significant impact on the number of workers covered by overtime laws and have exempted several million additional workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/webfeatures_viewpoints_final_overtime_regulations (Economic Policy Institute)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201210846/http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/webfeatures_viewpoints_final_overtime_regulations |date=December 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush administration maintained that the practical impact on working Americans would be minimal and that the changes would help clarify an outdated regulation. In particular, the new rules would have allowed more companies to offer [[flextime]] to their workers in lieu of overtime. The definition of ''exempt employees'' (ineligible for overtime) is regularly tested in the courts.  A recent case is [[Encino Motorcars v. Navarro]], which addresses the question of whether automobile dealer service advisors are eligible for overtime.

A company may harm themselves by docking a salaried employee for disciplinary reasons.
::"Once pay is reduced using an hourly calculation,  ... the employee is considered nonexempt, and so is every other worker in that job group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=CFO |date=May 2001  |page=16 |title=Whitewashing Blue Collars  |author=Marie Leone}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Uber (company)]] is an example of a company that, in various jurisdictions, has encountered various [[Uber protests and legal actions|legal problems]] regarding exemptions. The New York Times noted in 2017 that "Despite their appeal, the apps have faced a wave of criticism, including concerns over wheelchair accessibility and driver pay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====California overtime law====
The state of [[California]]'s overtime laws differ from federal overtime laws in many respects, and they involve overlapping [[statutes]], [[regulations]], and [[precedents]] that govern the compensation of employees in California.  
* Governing federal law is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080516054443/http://finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8 Fair Labor Standards Act] (29 USC 201-219)
* California overtime law is codified in provisions of:
:*the [https://web.archive.org/web/20111227075026/http://finduslaw.com/california_labor_code California Labor Code] and in
:*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110815204045/http://finduslaw.com/industrial_welfare_commission_wage_orders Wage orders] of the [[Industrial Welfare Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/iwc.html|title=DIR - IWC Home Page|first=|last=DIR|date=|website=www.dir.ca.gov|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
California employers must comply with both, since there are two sources of applicable law (federal and state).

In California, based on [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233012/http://www.finduslaw.com/node/6/#55 California Labor Code 1171], only an [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233012/http://www.finduslaw.com/node/6/#55 employment relationship] is required for overtime rules to apply.  Under the California [http://finduslaw.com/industrial_welfare_commission_wage_orders Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders], an "employer" is "any person ... who directly or indirectly, or through an agent or any other person, employs or exercises control over wages, hours, or working conditions of any person." Under the [https://web.archive.org/web/20111227075026/http://finduslaw.com/california_labor_code California Labor Code], an "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233824/http://www.finduslaw.com/node/4/#16 employee]" is "[any] person, including aliens and minors, rendering actual service  in any business for an employer, whether gratuitously or for wages or pay, whether the wages or pay are measured by the standard of time, piece, task, commission, or other method of calculation, and whether the service is rendered on a commission, concessionaire, or other basis."  

=====California: who is covered=====
Independent contractors are not employees covered by overtime laws, so it is important to determine if a worker is an independent contractor or an employee. Under California law, workers are generally presumed to be employees, not Independent contractors. The proper classification of individuals as Independent contractors must, therefore, pass one or more of the various multi-part tests for determining eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scalaw.com/independent-contractors/|title=Independent Contractors|author=|date=|website=scalaw.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foremost, pursuant to California Labor Code Section 510, non-exempt employees must be compensated at one and a half times the regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in a workday, 40 hours in a workweek and the first eight hours of a seventh consecutive workday. Employees in California are entitled to double-time for working more than twelve hour workdays or more than eight hours on the seventh consecutive workday of a single workweek.  Under federal law there are only 40 hour weekly overtime limits. This eight hour overtime limit in California frequently gives rise to wage-and-hour litigation for violations of state, but not federal, labour laws.

For example, "comp time" schemes, where employers tell employees that since they worked 10 hours on Monday they can work 6 hours on Tuesday, are illegal because even though the employees are not working more than 40 hours for the purposes of overtime compensation under federal law, they are working more than 8 hours for purposes of California overtime law and rounding the 6- and 10-hour workdays to two 8-hour workdays would cheat the employee out of two hours of overtime pay.

Perhaps the biggest difference between California and federal overtime law relates to the [http://www.dir.ca.gov/glossary.asp?letter=A administrative exemption's] "primarily engaged" in duties that meet the test for the exemption requirement, such as duties that involve exercising independent discretion and judgment as set forth in the controversial [https://web.archive.org/web/20110629143550/http://www.dir.ca.gov/iwc/WageOrders2006/iwcarticle4.htmlWage Order No. 4]. Whereas under the Fair Labor Standards Act "primarily engaged" does not necessarily mean at least half, under California wage-and-hour laws, less than half of exempt duties automatically eliminates the overtime exemption.

California's Labor Code Section 510 was amended and Section 511.5 added in 2016 pursuant to the California Workplace Flexibility Act of 2016. Pursuant to these changes, non-exempt workers have additional options to agree to work beyond eight hours in a workday without triggering an overtime pay obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scalaw.com/overtime-pay/|title=Overtime Pay|author=|date=|website=scalaw.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pg166 bioreactor.jpg|thumb|200px|A pilot plant of a bioreactor]]
A '''pilot plant''' is a pre-commercial production system that employs new production technology and/or produces small volumes of new technology-based products, mainly for the purpose of learning about the new technology. The knowledge obtained is then used for [[design]] of full-scale production systems and commercial products, as well as for identification of further research objectives and support of investment decisions. Other (non-technical) purposes include gaining public support for new technologies and questioning government regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Hellsmark, Johan Frishammar, Patrik Söderholm, Håkan Ylinenpää, The role of pilot and demonstration plants in technology development and innovation policy, Research Policy, Volume 45, Issue 9, November 2016, Pages 1743-1761, ISSN 0048-7333, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2016.05.005.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilot plant is a relative term in the sense that pilot plants are typically smaller than full-scale production plants, but are built in a range of sizes.  Also, as pilot plants are intended for learning, they typically are more flexible, possibly at the expense of economy. Some pilot plants are built in [[laboratory|laboratories]] using stock lab equipment, while others require substantial engineering efforts, cost millions of dollars, and are custom-assembled and fabricated from process equipment, instrumentation and piping.   They can also be used to train personnel for a full-scale plant. Pilot plants tend to be smaller compared to demonstration plants.

==Terminology==

A word similar to pilot plant is [[pilot line]].&lt;ref&gt;Pilot Production in Key Enabling Technologies; Crossing the Valley of Death and boosting the industrial deployment of Key Enabling Technologies in Europe,  Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research TNO on behalf of the European Commission, DG GROW—Directorate General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SME, 2015. {{ISBN|978-92-79-52140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, pilot plants and pilot lines perform the same functions, but 'pilot plant' is used in the context of (bio)chemical and advanced materials production systems, whereas 'pilot line' is used for new technology in general.

==Risk management==
Pilot plants are used to reduce the risk associated with construction of large process plants. They do so in several ways:
*Computer simulations and semi-empirical methods are used to determine the limitations of the pilot scale system. These mathematical models are then tested in a physical pilot-scale plant. Various modeling methods are used for scale-up. These methods include:
**Chemical similitude studies
**Mathematical modeling
**Aspen Plus/Aspen HYSYS modeling
**Finite Elemental Analysis (FEA)
**Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
***These theoretical modeling methods return the following:
****Finalized mass and energy balances
****Optimized system design and capacity
****Equipment requirements 
****System limitations
****The basis for determining the cost to build the pilot module
*They are substantially less expensive to build than full-scale plants.  The [[business]] does not put as much [[Financial capital|capital]] at risk on a project that may be inefficient or unfeasible.  Further, design changes can be made more cheaply at the pilot scale and kinks in the process can be worked out before the large plant is constructed.
*They provide valuable [[data]] for design of the full-scale plant.  Scientific data about reactions, material properties, corrosiveness, for instance, may be available, but it is difficult to predict the behavior of a process of any complexity. Engineering data from other process may be available, but this data can not always be clearly applied to the process of interest.  Designers use data from the pilot plant to refine their design of the production scale facility.

If a system is well defined and the engineering [[parameter]]s are known, pilot plants are not used.  For instance, a business that wants to expand production capacity by building a new plant that does the same thing as an existing plant may choose to not use a pilot plant.

Additionally, advances in [[process simulation]] on computers have increased the confidence of process designers and reduced the need for pilot plants.  However, they are still used as even state-of-the-art simulation cannot accurately predict the behavior of complex systems.

==Scale dependence of plant properties==
As a system increases in size, system properties that depend on quantity of matter (with [[extensive properties]]) may change. The surface area to liquid ratio in a chemical plant is a good example of such a property. On a small chemical scale, in a flask, say, there is a relatively large surface area to liquid ratio. However, if the reaction in question is scaled up to fit in a 500-gallon tank, the surface area to liquid ratio becomes much smaller. As a result of this difference in surface area to liquid ratio, the exact nature of the thermodynamics and the reaction kinetics of the process change in a non-linear fashion. This is why a reaction in a beaker can behave vastly differently from the same reaction in a large-scale production process.

===Other factors===
Other factors that may change during the transformation to a production scale include:
*Reaction kinetics
*Chemical equilibrium
*Material properties
*Fluid dynamics
*Thermodynamics
*Equipment selection
*Agitation
*Uniformity / homogeneity

After data has been collected from operation of a pilot plant, a larger production-scale facility may be built. Alternatively, a demonstration plant, which is typically bigger than a pilot plant, but smaller than a full-scale production plant, may be built to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of the process. Businesses sometimes continue to operate the pilot plant in order to test ideas for new products, new feedstocks, or different operating conditions.  Alternatively, they may be operated as production facilities, augmenting production from the main plant.

Recent trends try to keep the size of the plant a small as possible to save costs. This approach is called [[miniplant]] technology. The [[flow chemistry]] takes up this trend and uses [[flow miniplant]] technology for small-scale manufacturing.

==Bench scale vs pilot vs demonstration==
The differences between bench scale, pilot scale and demonstration scale are strongly influenced by industry and application. Some industries use pilot plant and demonstration plant interchangeably. Some pilot plants are built as portable modules that can be easily transported as a contained unit. 
 
For batch processes, in the pharmaceutical industry for example, bench scale is typically conducted on samples 1–20&amp;nbsp;kg or less, whereas pilot scale testing is performed with samples of 20–100&amp;nbsp;kg. Demonstration scale is essentially operating the equipment at full commercial feed rates over extended time periods to prove operational stability.
 
For continuous processes, in the petroleum industry for example, bench scale systems are typically microreactor or CSTR systems with less than 1000 mL of catalyst, studying reactions and/or separations on a once-through basis. Pilot plants will typically have reactors with catalyst volume between 1 and 100 litres, and will often incorporate product separation and gas/liquid recycle with the goal of closing the mass balance. Demonstration plants, also referred to as semi-works plants, will study the viability of the process on a pre-commercial scale, with typical catalyst volumes in the 100 - 1000 litre range. The design of a demonstration scale plant for a continuous process will closely resemble that of the anticipated future commercial plant, albeit at a much lower throughput, and its goal is to study catalyst performance and operating lifetime over an extended period, while generating significant quantities of product for market testing.
 
In the development of new processes, the design and operation of the pilot and demonstration plant will often run in parallel with the design of the future commercial plant, and the results from pilot testing programs are key to optimizing the commercial plant flowsheet. It is common in cases where process technology has been successfully implemented that the savings at the commercial scale resulting from pilot testing will significantly outweigh the cost of the pilot plant itself.

==Steps to creating a custom pilot plant==
Custom pilot plants are commonly designed either for research or commercial purposes. They can range in size from a small system with no automation and low flow, to a highly automated system producing relatively large amounts of products in a day. No matter the size, the steps to designing and fabricating a working pilot plant are the same. They are:

# Pre-engineering - completing a process flow diagram (PFD), basic piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&amp;ID's) and initial equipment layouts. 
# Engineering modeling and optimization - 2D and 3D models are created, using a simulation software to model the process parameters and scale the chemical processes. These modeling software help determine system limitations, non-linear chemical and physical changes, and potential equipment sizing. Mass and energy balances, finalized P&amp;ID's and general arrangement drawings are produced. 
# Automation strategies for the system are developed (if needed). Controls system programming begins and will continue through fabrication and assembly
# Fabrication and assembly - after an optimized design has been determined, the custom pilot is fabricated and assembled. Pilot plants can either be assembled on-site or off-site as modular skids that will be constructed and tested in a controlled environment. 
# Testing - testing of completed systems, including system controls, is conducted to ensure proper system function. 
# Installation and startup - if constructed offsite, pilot skids are installed onsite. After all equipment is in place, full system startup is completed by integrating the system with existing plant utilities and controls. Full operation is tested and affirmed.
# Training - operator training is complete and full system documentation is handed over.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3128">'''Project management simulation''' is [[simulation]] used for [[project management]] training and analysis. 
Project management simulation is often used as [[training simulation]] for [[project manager]]s. In other cases it is used for [[what-if analysis]] and for supporting [[decision-making]] in real projects.
Frequently the simulation is conducted using [[software tool]]s.

==Training==
Project management simulation for training is an interactive learning activity, frequently practiced as a group exercise. The purpose  of the simulation is to impart to students the competencies (i.e. knowledge, skills, and attitudes) that will ultimately improve their performance.&lt;ref name="salas"&gt;Salas, E., Wildman, J. L., Piccolo, R. F. (2009). "Using simulation-based training to enhance management Education", Academy of Management Learning &amp; Education, 8, 559–573.&lt;/ref&gt;
It confronts trainees with the situations and problems that arise in real world projects. Trainees see the consequences of the decisions they make. They can track the evolution of the project parameters: [[Scope (project management)|scope]], costs, [[Schedule (project management)|schedule]], and quality, as well as human factors. The simulation provides an opportunity for learners to solve typical project problems, to make mistakes and analyze them. 
Pedagogic goals of project management simulation can be to teach how to:
* determine goal and objectives of a project; 
* [[Estimation (project management)|estimate]] cost; 
* plan [[Task (project management)|tasks]] of the project; 
* plan [[Resource (project management)|resources]] in a project; 
* use project management tools; 
* control the progress of a project; 
* make [[Project team|team]] decisions under stress; 
* react appropriately in typical project management situations 
Different studies&lt;ref name="salas" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nembhard, D., K. Yip and A. Shtub, "Comparing Competitive and Cooperative Strategies for Learning Project Management" April, 2009, [http://www.jee.org/2009/april/8.pdf ''International Journal of Engineering Education''], 181–192&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that using [[simulation-based training]] for training project managers is superior to other methods.

==Analysis==
Project management simulation is used to analyze real projects. The goal of the simulation is to show the user the different possible outcomes of his decisions, along with the probability that each outcome will occur. The simulation helps in reducing the project risk and in choosing the best project plan. 
In a typical simulation the project is first modeled into a software tool along with uncertain variables. A simulation is then run to check the different possible outcomes and their probability as a result of different inputs for the uncertain variables.

{{Marketing}}

'''Relationship marketing''' was first defined as a form of marketing developed from direct response marketing campaigns which emphasizes [[customer retention]] and [[customer satisfaction|satisfaction]], rather than a focus on sales transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/relationship-marketing.html|title=What is relationship marketing? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berry|first=Leonard L.|date=2002|title=Relationship Marketing of Services Perspectives from 1983 and 2000|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/j366v01n01_05|journal=Journal of Relationship Marketing|volume=1|issue=1|pages=59–77|doi=10.1300/j366v01n01_05|issn=1533-2667|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationship marketing differs from other forms of marketing in that it recognizes the long term value of [[customer relationship management|customer relationships]] and extends communication beyond [[Intrusiveness|intrusive]] [[advertising]] and sales promotional messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Relationship Marketing|last=PALMATIER|first=ROBERT|publisher=MARKETING SCIENCE INSTITUTE|year=|isbn=|editor-link=http://foster.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/rm-book.pdf|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the growth of the internet and [[mobile platform]]s, relationship marketing has continued to evolve as technology opens more collaborative and social communication channels. This includes tools for managing relationships with customers that goes beyond demographic and customer service data. Relationship marketing extends to include inbound marketing efforts, (a combination of [[search engine optimization|search optimization]] and strategic content), [[Public relations|PR]], social media and application development.

==Development==
Relationship marketing refers to an arrangement where both the buyer and seller have an interest in providing a more satisfying exchange. This approach tries to transcend the post purchase-exchange process with a customer to make richer contact by providing a more [[personalization|personalised]] purchase, and uses the experience to create stronger ties.Relationship marketing is different from other marketing techniques as it mainly focuses on long term relationship with customers.

From a [[Social anthropology|social anthropological]] perspective, relationship marketing theory and practice can be interpreted as [[Gift economy#Spheres of exchange and 'economic systems'|commodity exchange]] that instrumentalise features of [[Gift economy|gift exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;Rus, Andrej (2008).[http://www.drustvo-antropologov.si/AN/PDF/2008_1/Anthropological_Notebooks_XIV_1_Rus.pdf "'Gift vs. commoditiy' debate revisited". Anthropological Notebooks 14 (1): 81–102.]&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that marketers — consciously or intuitively — are recognizing the power contained in [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|'pre-modern' forms of exchange]] and have begun to use it. This perspective on marketing opens up fertile ground for future research, where marketing theory and practice can benefit from in-depth research of the principles governing [[Gift economy|gift exchange]].

According to Liam Alvey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berry|first=Leonard|title=Relationship Marketing|publisher=American Marketing Association, Chicago|year=1983|page=146|ISBN=0-87757-161-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; relationship marketing can be applied when there are competitive product alternatives for customers to choose from; and when there is an ongoing desire for the product or service.

Relationship marketing revolves around the concept of gaining loyal customers. Research conducted to developing relationship marketing suggests that firms can best do this through having one of the three value strategies; best price, best product, or best service. Firms can relay their relationship marketing message through [https://www.examples.com/business/value-statement.html value statements].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing The Core|last=Kerin|first=Roger|publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson|year=2018|isbn=978-1-259-71236-4|location=|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of relationship marketing has been facilitated by several generations of customer relationship management software that allow tracking and analyzing of each customer's preferences, activities, tastes, likes, dislikes, and complaints. For example, an automobile manufacturer maintaining a database of when and how repeat customers buy their products, the options they choose, the way they finance the purchase etc., is in a powerful position to develop one-to-one marketing offers and product benefits.

In web applications, the consumer shopping profile can be built as the person shops on the website. This information is then used to compute what can be his or her likely preferences in other categories. These predicted offerings can then be shown to the customer through cross-sell, email recommendation and other channels.

Relationship marketing has also migrated back into direct mail, allowing marketers to take advantage of the technological capabilities of digital, toner-based printing presses to produce unique, personalized pieces for each recipient through a technique called "[[variable data printing]]". Marketers can personalize documents by any information contained in their databases, including name, address, demographics, purchase history, and dozens (or even hundreds) of other variables. The result is a printed piece that (ideally) reflects the individual needs and preferences of each recipient, increasing the relevance of the piece and increasing the response rate.

==Scope==
Relationship marketing has also been strongly influenced by [[Business process reengineering|reengineering]]. According to (process) reengineering theory, organizations should be structured according to complete tasks and processes rather than functions. That is, [[cross-functional team]]s should be responsible for a whole process, from beginning to end, rather than having the work go from one functional department to another. Traditional marketing is said to use the functional (or 'silo') department approach. The legacy of this can still be seen in the traditional four P's of the [[marketing mix]]. [[Pricing]], [[product management]], [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]], and [[distribution (business)|placement]]. According to Gordon (1999), the marketing mix approach is too limited to provide a usable framework for assessing and developing customer relationships in many industries and should be replaced by the relationship marketing alternative model where the focus is on customers, relationships and interaction over time, rather than markets and products.

In contrast, relationship marketing is cross-functional marketing. It is organized around processes that involve all aspects of the organization. In fact, some commentators prefer to call relationship marketing "relationship management" in recognition of the fact that it involves much more than that which is normally included in marketing.

Because of its broad scope, relationship marketing can be effective in many contexts.  As well as being relevant to 'for profit' businesses, research indicates that relationship marketing can be useful for organizations in the voluntary sector&lt;ref&gt;Bussell, H., &amp; Forbes, D. (2006). Developing relationship marketing in the voluntary sector. Journal of Nonprofit &amp; Public Sector Marketing, 15(1–2), 151–174.&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;Gillett, A. G. (2015). REMARKOR: RELATIONSHIP MARKETING ORIENTATION ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE. Journal of Services Research, 15(1), 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillett, A.G. (2016). MULTIPLE RELATIONSHIPS WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS: THE SCOPE OF RELATIONSHIP MARKETING FOR PUBLIC SERVICES. Journal of Services Research, 16(2), pp. 1–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Christopher, Adrian Payne, and David Ballantyne&lt;ref name="Christopher M., Payne, A. and Ballantyne, D. 1991 264"&gt;{{cite book | title = Relationship Marketing | publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford | year = 1991 | page = 264 | author = Christopher M., Payne, A. and Ballantyne, D. | ISBN=0-7506-4839-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Cranfield School of Management]] claim that relationship marketing has the potential to forge a new synthesis between quality management, customer service management, and marketing.

==Approaches==

===Satisfaction===
Relationship marketing relies upon the communication and acquisition of consumer requirements solely from existing customers in a mutually beneficial exchange usually involving permission for contact by the customer through an "[[opt-in]]" system.&lt;ref name="gale_1"&gt;Gale, B.T., Chapman., R.W. (1994) ''Managing Customer Value: Creating Quality and Service That Customers Can See'' New York: Free Press&lt;/ref&gt; With particular relevance to [[customer satisfaction]] the relative price and quality of goods and services produced or sold through a company alongside customer service generally determine the amount of sales relative to that of competing companies. Although groups targeted through relationship marketing may be large, accuracy of communication and overall relevancy to the customer remains higher than that of direct marketing, but has less potential for generating new leads than direct marketing and is limited to [[Viral marketing]] for the acquisition of further customers.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Retention===
A principle of relationship marketing is the retention of customers through varying means to ensure repeated trade from preexisting customers by satisfying requirements above those of competing companies through a mutually beneficial relationship&lt;ref name="gale_1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gordon | first = Ian | title = Relationship Marketing: New Strategies, Techniques and Technologies to Win the Customers You Want and Keep Them Forever | publisher=John Wiley and Sons Publishers | year = 1999 | page = 336 | ISBN=0-471-64173-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is counterbalancing new customers and opportunities with current and existing customers as a means of [[profit maximization|maximizing profit]] and counteracting the "leaky bucket theory of business" in which new customers gained in older direct marketing oriented businesses were at the expense of or coincided with the loss of older customers.&lt;ref name="kotler_1"&gt;Kotler, Philip, Armstrong, Gary, Saunders, John and Wong, Veronica. (1999). "Principles of Marketing" 2nd ed. Prentice Hall Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kotler_2"&gt;Kotler, Philip, Armstrong, Gary, Saunders, John and Wong, Veronica. (1999)., p482&lt;/ref&gt; This process of "churning" is less economically viable than retaining all or the majority of customers using both direct and relationship management as lead generation via new customers requires more investment.&lt;ref name="kotler_3"&gt;Kotler, Philip, Armstrong, Gary, Saunders, John and Wong, Veronica. (1999)., p483&lt;/ref&gt;

Many companies in competing markets will redirect or allocate large amounts of resources or attention towards customer retention as in markets with increasing competition it may cost 5 times more to attract new customers than it would to retain current customers, as direct or "offensive" marketing requires much more extensive resources to cause defection from competitors.&lt;ref name="kotler_3" /&gt; However, it is suggested that because of the extensive classic [[marketing]] theories center on means of attracting customers and creating transactions rather than maintaining them, the majority usage of direct marketing used in the past is now gradually being used more alongside relationship marketing as its importance becomes more recognizable.&lt;ref name="kotler_3" /&gt;

It is claimed by [[Fred Reichheld|Reichheld]] and Sasser&lt;ref&gt;Reichheld, F. and Sasser, W. (1990) "Zero defects: quality comes to services", ''Harvard Business Review'', Sept–Oct, 1990, pp 105–111&lt;/ref&gt; that a 5% improvement in [[customer retention]] can cause an increase in profitability of between 25 and 85 percent (in terms of [[net present value]]) depending on the industry. However Carrol, P. and Reichheld, F.&lt;ref&gt;Carrol, P. and Reichheld, F. (1992) "The fallacy of customer retention", Journal of Retail Banking, vol 13, no 4, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; dispute these calculations, claiming they result from faulty cross-sectional analysis. Research by John Fleming and Jim Asplund indicates that engaged customers generate 1.7 times more revenue than normal customers, while having engaged employees and engaged customers returns a revenue gain of 3.4 times the norm.

According to Buchanan and Gilles,&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, R. and Gilles, C. (1990) "Value managed relationship: The key to customer retention and profitability", European Management Journal, vol 8, no 4, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; the increased profitability associated with customer retention efforts occurs because of several factors that occur once a relationship has been established with a customer.
* The cost of acquisition occurs only at the beginning of a relationship, so the longer the relationship, the lower the [[amortization|amortized]] cost.
* Account maintenance costs decline as a percentage of total costs (or as a percentage of revenue).
* Long-term customers tend to be less inclined to switch, and also tend to be less price sensitive. This can result in stable unit sales volume and increases in dollar-sales volume.
* Long-term customers may initiate free [[word of mouth]] promotions and referrals.
* Long-term customers are more likely to purchase ancillary products and high [[profit margin|margin]] supplemental products.
* Customers that stay with you tend to be satisfied with the relationship and are less likely to switch to competitors, making it difficult for competitors to enter the market or gain market share.
* Regular customers tend to be less expensive to service because they are familiar with the process, require less "education", and are consistent in their order placement.
* Increased customer retention and loyalty makes the employees' jobs easier and more satisfying. In turn, happy employees feed back into better customer satisfaction in a [[virtuous circle]].

Relationship marketers speak of the "relationship ladder of [[customer loyalty]]". It groups types of customers according to their level of loyalty. The ladder's first rung consists of "prospects", that is, people that have not purchased yet but are likely to in the future. This is followed by the successive rungs of "customer", "client", "supporter", "advocate", and "partner". The relationship marketer's objective is to "help" customers get as high up the ladder as possible. This usually involves providing more personalized service and providing service quality that exceeds expectations at each step.

Customer retention efforts involve considerations such as the following:
# Customer valuation – Gordon (1999) describes how to value customers and categorize them according to their financial and strategic value so that companies can decide where to invest for deeper relationships and which relationships need to be served differently or even terminated.
# Customer retention measurement – Dawkins and Reichheld (1990) calculated a company's "customer retention rate". This is simply the percentage of customers at the beginning of the year that are still customers by the end of the year. In accordance with this statistic, an increase in retention rate from 80% to 90% is associated with a doubling of the average life of a customer relationship from 5 to 10 years. This ratio can be used to make comparisons between products, between market segments, and over time.
# Determine reasons for defection – Look for the root causes, not mere symptoms. This involves probing for details when talking to former customers. Other techniques include the analysis of customers' complaints and competitive benchmarking (see [[competitor analysis]]).
# Develop and implement a corrective plan – This could involve actions to improve employee practices, using [[benchmarking]] to determine best corrective practices, visible endorsement of top management, adjustments to the company's reward and recognition systems, and the use of "recovery teams" to eliminate the causes of defections.

A technique to calculate the value to a firm of a sustained customer relationship has been developed. This calculation is typically called [[customer lifetime value]].

Retention strategies may also include building barriers to customer switching. This can be done by [[product bundling]] (combining several products or services into one "package" and offering them at a single price), [[cross-selling]] (selling related products to current customers), cross promotions (giving discounts or other [[sales promotion|promotional incentives]] to purchasers of related products), [[loyalty program]]s (giving incentives for frequent purchases), increasing switching costs (adding termination costs, such as mortgage termination fees), and integrating computer systems of multiple organizations (primarily in industrial marketing).

Many relationship marketers use a team-based approach. The rationale is that the more points of contact between the organization and customer, the stronger will be the bond, and the more secure the relationship.

==Application==

Relationship marketing and traditional (or transactional) marketing are not mutually exclusive and there is no need for a conflict between them. In practice, a relationship-oriented marketer still has choices, depending on the situation.  Most firms blend the two approaches to match their portfolio of products and services.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Many products have a service component to them and this service component has been getting larger in recent decades.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Internal marketing===
Relationship marketing stresses what it calls internal marketing, or using a marketing orientation within the organization itself. It is claimed that many of the relationship marketing attributes like collaboration, loyalty and trust determine what "internal customers" say and do. According to this theory, every employee, team, or department in the company is simultaneously a supplier and a customer of services and products. An employee obtains a service at a point in the [[value chain]] and then provides a service to another employee further along the value chain. If internal marketing is effective, every employee will both provide and receive exceptional service from and to other employees. It also helps employees understand the significance of their roles and how their roles relate to others'. If implemented well, it can also encourage every employee to see the process in terms of the customer's perception of value added, and the organization's strategic mission. Further it is claimed that an effective internal marketing program is a prerequisite for effective external marketing efforts.(George, W. 1990)

===The six markets model===
Christopher, Payne and Ballantyne (1991)&lt;ref name="Christopher M., Payne, A. and Ballantyne, D. 1991 264"/&gt; identify six markets which they claim are central to relationship marketing. They are: internal markets, supplier markets, recruitment markets, referral markets, influence markets, and customer markets.

[[Referral marketing]] is developing and implementing a marketing plan to stimulate referrals. Although it may take months before you see the effect of referral marketing, this is often the most effective part of an overall marketing plan and the best use of resources{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}.

Marketing to suppliers is aimed at ensuring a long-term conflict-free relationship in which all parties understand each other's needs and exceed each other's expectations. Such a strategy can reduce costs and improve quality.

[[Influencer marketing|Influence markets]] involve a wide range of sub-markets including: government regulators, standards bodies, lobbyists, stockholders, bankers, venture capitalists, financial analysts, stockbrokers, consumer associations, environmental associations, and labor associations. These activities are typically carried out by the [[public relations]] department, but relationship marketers feel that marketing to all six markets is the responsibility of everyone in the organization. Each market may require its own explicit strategies and a separate [[marketing mix]] for each.

===Live-in Marketing===

Live-in Marketing (LIM) is a variant of marketing and advertising in which the target consumer is allowed to sample or use a brands product in a relaxed atmosphere over a longer period of time. Much like product placement in film and television LIM was developed as a means to reach select target demographics in a non-invasive and much less garish manner than traditional advertising.

====History====

While LIM represents an entirely untapped avenue of marketing for both big and small brands alike it is not an all that novel an idea. With the rising popularity of experiential and event marketing&lt;ref&gt;Ad, Marketing Spending to rise 3.9% in 2008, Media Post, Erik Sass 16 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; in North America and Europe, as well as the relatively high ROI in terms of advertising dollars spent on experiential marketing compared to traditional big media advertising, industry analysts see LIM as a natural progression.

====Premise====

LIM functions around the premise that marketing or advertising agencies go out on behalf of the brand in question and find its target demographic. From that point forward avenues such as sponsorship or direct product placement and sampling are explored. Unlike traditional event marketing, LIM suggests that end-users will sample the product or service in a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere. The idea behind this technique is that the end-user will have as positive as possible an interaction with the given brand thereby leading to [[word-of-mouth]]&lt;ref&gt;EMI Strategic Insights Report : The Viral Impact of Events, Event Marketing Institute 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  communication and potential future purchase. If the success of traditional event and experiential marketing is shared with LIM, then it could indicate a lucrative and low-cost means of product promotion. However, this means of advertising is still in its infancy and more research is required to determine the true success of such campaigns. The first company to explicitly offer LIM services was Hostival Connect in late 2010.

The '''right to repeat performance''' is a [[consumer]] right of [[Legal remedy|remedy]] created under section 55 of the UK [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/contents Consumer Rights Act 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; which provides for a new right for a consumer to require a trader to perform a service again, if the trader is in breach of the agreed services contract or its implied terms, or to perform again such part of the service as is necessary in order to conform with the contract.

This right was created alongside a right to price reduction. The right to repeat performance takes priority unless performance cannot be repeated. A trader in breach of a services contract is obliged to repeat its performance within a reasonable time and without significant inconvenience to the consumer, and to bear any necessary costs in doing so.

It is possible to agree a contract which excludes the possibility of repeat performance.

This part of the Consumer Rights Act came into effect on 1 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;UK Government, [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-consumer-protection/2010-to-2015-government-policy-consumer-protection#appendix-8-consumer-rights-act-2015 2010 to 2015 government policy: consumer protection], accessed 24 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]' [[Public Bill Committee]], an amendment was proposed by [[Stella Creasy]] MP, shadow minister for Business, Innovation and Skills:

:"Where the quality of provision of services has been deemed to be hazardous or so poor as to cause the consumer to reasonably lose confidence in the trader’s ability to provide services which they would wish to purchase, the consumer may refuse a repeat performance and exercise their right to price reduction...."

This amendment was withdrawn on assurances that existing [[common law]] and statutory remedies provide protection for consumers from traders who would unnecessarily endanger their personal safety, and especially that consumers would not be obliged to allow them back into their homes ever again if they do not feel happy with that.&lt;ref&gt;They work for you, [https://www.theyworkforyou.com/pbc/2013-14/Consumer_Rights_Bill/11-0_2014-03-06a.2.0 Clause 55 - Right to repeat performance]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince '''Luigi Marcantonio Francesco Rodolfo Scipione Borghese''', commonly known as '''Scipione Borghese''' (11 September 1871, [[Migliarino]] – 18 November 1927, [[Florence]]), was an Italian aristocrat, industrialist, politician, explorer, mountain climber and racing driver belonging to the [[House of Borghese]].

He is best known for participating in (and winning) the [[Peking to Paris]] race in 1907, accompanied by the journalist [[Luigi Barzini Sr.]] and  Ettore Guizardi, the prince's chauffeur, who apparently did most of the driving.  Nevertheless, before 1907 he had already become known internationally as a traveller, explorer, diplomat and mountain climber.  In 1900 he had finished a journey in Asia from [[Beirut]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. His book ''In Asia: Siria, Eufrate, Babilonia'' (In Asia:  Syria, Euphrates, Babylon), published in 1903 and which proved a success, describes his journey from Beirut to Basra and the head of the Persian Gulf.  Subsequently he also completed a journey across China, recounted in another book.

Tall and abstemious, he was a man of few words, cold, with calm and measured manners, and with great self-control.  He was a [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|deputy]] of the [[Italian Radical Party|Partito Radicale]] in the [[Italian parliament]] of 1904 to 1913, fought bravely in the [[First World War]], and began important improvement works in the "[[Agro Romano]]".

==Family==
Borghese was the eldest son of Paolo, 9th Prince of Sulmona (1845–1920) and his wife Ilona, Countess Apponyi de Nagy-Appony. He was twice married, firstly to Anna Maria de Ferrari (23 March 1874 – 25 November 1924), daughter of Gaetano, duca di Ferrari by his wife Maria Annenkov, on 23 May 1895, and they had two daughters.  His second marriage to Teodora Martini on 8 August 1926 produced no issue.  He was succeeded in the title [[Prince of Sulmona]] by his brother Livio Borghese, 11th Prince of Sulmona (1874–1939), second son of the 9th Prince.

===Children===
# [http://www.geneall.net/I/per_page.php?id=584804 Santa Borghese] (1 November 1897 Île de France, Paris – 13 April 1997 Rome). She married on 4 July 1925 at Isola Borghese, Lago di Garda, Astorre Hercolani, 9º principe Hercolani. They have 7 children with an A beginning surname. 
# [http://www.geneall.net/I/per_page.php?id=584806 Livia Borghese] (4 March 1901 Île de France, Paris  – 14 December 1969 Bologna, nine months after the death of her husband); she married on 30 December 1930 at Isola Borghese, Lago di Garda, Alessandro, conte Cavazza (1895–1969), by whom she had three sons (the eldest apparently born in 1922, or eight years before her marriage), and several descendants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4282">'''Securities and Exchange Board of India (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012''' (also called '''AIF Regulations''') are a set of regulations introduced by [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] (SEBI) in 2012, to regulate [[pooled investment]] funds in [[India]], such as [[real estate]], [[private equity]] and [[hedge fund]]s.&lt;ref name=HinduPermts&gt;{{cite news|title=SEBI permits 123 alternative investment funds to operate in India|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/sebi-permits-123-alternative-investment-funds-to-operate-in-india/article6651625.ece|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=[[The Hindu Business Line]]|date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
These regulations apply to all pooled investment funds registered in India which received capital from Indian or foreign investors.&lt;ref name=HinduPermts/&gt; These were made to regulated funds that were not covered under the [[Securities and Exchange Board Of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996|SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996]];  SEBI (Custodian Of Securities) Regulations, 1996 and any other regulations of SEBI.&lt;ref name="S."&gt;{{cite book|author=Pratap Giri S.|title=Investment Banking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ua2tAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT233|accessdate=17 April 2015|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-1-259-05872-1|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was introduced to bring unregistered funds in India under the ambit of law. Prior to the introduction of this, many funds were operating in India that could not be classified as domestic [[venture capital]] funds (VCF), foreign venture capital investors (FVCI) or  foreign [[institutional investor]] (FII).&lt;ref name="S."/&gt; After introduction of these regulations in July 2012, 123 entities registered themselves by November 2014.&lt;ref name=HinduPermts/&gt;

The Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) have been categorised into three classes:

* ''Category I'': These funds receive incentives from the government, SEBI or other regulating agencies. These include [[Social venture capital|social venture fund]]s, [[Infrastructure debt|infrastructure fund]]s, [[Venture capital|venture capital fund]]s and [[SME finance|SME fund]]s.&lt;ref name=HinduPermts/&gt;
* ''Category II'': These funds are allowed to invest anywhere in any combination, but cannot take debts, except for day-to-day operation purposes. These include [[private equity]] funds and [[Bond fund|debt funds]].&lt;ref name=HinduPermts/&gt;&lt;ref name="S."/&gt;
* ''Category III'': Funds that make short-term investments and then sell, like [[hedge fund]]s, come under this.&lt;ref name=HinduPermts/&gt;

AIFs are usually marketed towards high-worth persons. The minimum investment from one person is {{Currency|10000000|INR}}. The minimum corpus of the funds is {{currency|200000000|INR}}. At any time, not more than 1000 investors are allowed. The initial contribution of the [[Investment management|fund manager]] or [[Corporate promoter|promoter]] should less than 2.5% or {{currency|50000000|INR}}, whichever is less.&lt;ref name=Dejargoned&gt;{{cite news|title=De-jargoned: Alternative investment funds|url=http://www.livemint.com/Money/WMWedyfbu45PPubMcUURyN/Dejargoned-Alternative-investment-funds.html|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=[[Live Mint]]|date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2015 Union budget of India]], it was announced that [[foreign direct investment]]s (FDI) would be allowed in AIFs. It was also announced that the tax liability will be shifted from the funds to the investors in Category I and Category II.&lt;ref name=FDi&gt;{{cite news|title=Govt to allow FDI in alternative investment funds|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/budget/govt-to-allow-fdi-in-alternative-investment-funds/article6946169.ece|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=[[The Hindu Business Line]]|date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuia was heavily involved in all major political changes and debates in American Samoa between 1961 and 2010.&lt;ref name=samoanews/&gt; He was in office more than a decade before the current American Samoa Fono building, completed in 1973, was constructed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashpo.org/walktour/09.html Executive Offices of the Governor American Samoa Government]&lt;/ref&gt; Following Tuia's death in 2010, the longest-serving member of the Fono is currently House Speaker [[Savali Talavou Ale]].&lt;ref name=samoanews2/&gt;

==Biography==
===Personal life===
Tuia was from the village of [[Pavaiai]].&lt;ref name=samoanews2/&gt; He was widely known by the name "Tua."

Tuia served as a [[sa'o]] in his village.&lt;ref name=samoanews2&gt;{{cite news |first=Fili |last=Sagapolutele |title=Territorial leaders bid farewell to Tuana’itau |url=http://www.samoanewsonline.com/viewstory.php?storyid=12628 |work=[[Samoa News]] |publisher= |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2010-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716000921/http://www.samoanewsonline.com/viewstory.php?storyid=12628 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a [[Legal practitioners|legal practitioner]], specializing in cases relating to [[Land registration|titles]] and land.&lt;ref name=samoanews2/&gt; He was also a [[businessman]] within American Samoa's [[construction industry]] in addition to his political career.&lt;ref name=samoanews/&gt;

===American Samoa House of Representatives===

Tuia, though virtually unknown in political circles,&lt;ref name=samoanews/&gt; was elected as the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] in 1961, on his first day in office as an elected representative.&lt;ref name=samoanews2/&gt; His election as Speaker surprised many observers, as Tuia, a political newcomer and first-term representative, knew few people outside Tualauta County.&lt;ref name=samoanews2/&gt; The book, ''Fono Jubilee'', which was published in 1998 and edited by Senator [[Fofo I.F. Sunia]], described the surprise at Tuia's selection as Speaker, "Few people ever heard of him which is why his election as Speaker came as a shock."&lt;ref name=samoanews/&gt; Tuia later served as Speaker on during several legislative sessions from 1967–68; 1978–1984; and 1987-1992.&lt;ref name=samoanews/&gt;

Tuia spent 30 years in the American Samoa House of Representatives, including 18 years as the Speaker of the House.&lt;ref name=samoanews/&gt; He chose not to seek re-election in 1992 to pursue a successful campaign for the American Samoan Senate.

===American Samoa Senate===
He was elected to the [[American Samoa Senate]] for Tualauta County in 1992.&lt;ref name=rnzi/&gt;&lt;ref name=samoanews2/&gt; His first term as Senator began in 1993&lt;ref name=samoanews&gt;{{cite news |first=Fili |last=Sagapolutele |title=Territory’s longest serving legislator, Senator Tuanaitau Tuia, passes away at 89 |url=http://www.samoanewsonline.com/viewstory.php?storyid=12283 |work=[[Samoa News]] |publisher= |date=2010-01-23 |accessdate=2010-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716000243/http://www.samoanewsonline.com/viewstory.php?storyid=12283 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he remained in that office until his death in 2010.&lt;ref name=rnzi/&gt;

Tuia was taken to [[Lyndon B. Johnson Tropical Medical Center]] and placed in the [[intensive-care unit]] on January 21, 2010.  He died at the hospital in [[Faga'alu]] on January 22, 2010, at the age of 89.&lt;ref name=rnzi/&gt;  He was survived by six children; grandchildren, including current  Rep. [[Galu Satele Jr.]];&lt;ref name=samoanews/&gt; and great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name=rnzi/&gt;

'''Zonta International''' is an international [[Fraternal and service organizations|service organization]] with the mission of advancing the status of women.&lt;ref name=Axelrod&gt;[[Alan Axelrod]], ''International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders'', New York: Facts on File, Inc., 1997, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first Zonta Club was founded in [[Buffalo, New York]], United States, in 1919 by a group of [[businesswomen]] under the leadership of [[Marian de Forest]]. It was organized along the lines of the [[Rotary Club]], with one woman from each business classification admitted to the local club and all members required to give 60% of their time to the "work under which they are classified". By 1923 clubs had been established in [[New York City]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Detroit]], [[Cleveland]], and [[Toledo, Ohio]]. The National President was Miss [[Harriet Ackroyd|Harriet A. Ackroyd]] of [[Utica, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Preuss, Arthur, ''A Dictionary of Secret and other Societies'', St. Louis: B. Herder Book Co., 1924; republished Detroit: Gale Reference Company, 1966; pp. 501-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Confederation of Zonta Clubs''' was formed in 1930. Originally conceived as a female equivalent of the [[Lions Clubs]] (an organization that, until 1987, was all-male), Zonta sponsors program to help women in the field of public affairs and policy making. It has [[consultative status]] with the [[Council of Europe]], the [[United Nations]] (UN), [[ILO]], and several UN agencies.&lt;ref name=Axelrod /&gt;

Currently, Zonta International is headquartered in [[Oak Brook, Illinois]]. The organization has more than 31,000 members in 65 countries.{{fact|date=August 2015}}

The organization's name derives from the [[Lakota language|Lakota]] ''zónta'' meaning "honest" or "trustworthy".{{fact|date=August 2015}}

==Educational programs and awards==
Zonta International seeks to provide opportunities for women through a number of educational programs and awards.

===Amelia Earhart Fellowship===
Established in 1938 in honor of famed pilot and Zontian [[Amelia Earhart]], the Amelia Earhart Fellowship is awarded annually to women pursuing Ph.D./doctoral degrees in aerospace-related sciences or aerospace-related engineering. The Fellowship of US$10,000, awarded to 35 Fellows around the globe each year, may be used at any university or college offering accredited post-graduate courses and degrees in these fields.

===Jane M. Klausman Women in Business Scholarship===
The Jane M. Klausman Women in Business Scholarship program helps women to pursue undergraduate and master's degrees in business management and to overcome gender barriers from the classroom to the boardroom. Since the program's inception, Zonta has awarded 357 scholarships to women from 47 countries.

===Young Women in Public Affairs Award Program===
Established in 1990 by Past International President Leneen Forde, the Young Women in Public Affairs Award honors young women aged from 16 to 19 who demonstrate a commitment to leadership in public policy, government and volunteer organizations. The program operates at the Zonta club, district/region and international levels. Zonta clubs provide awards for club recipients, and district/region and international awards are funded by the Zonta International Foundation. District recipients receive US$1,000, and ten international recipients are selected from the district/region recipients to receive awards of US$4,000 each.

===Z and Golden Z Clubs===
Established in 1948, the Z Club and Golden Z Club program is one of Zonta International's longest-running programs. Z clubs and Golden Z clubs help high-school, college and university students develop leadership skills, promote career exploration and encourage members to participate in community, school and international service projects.
