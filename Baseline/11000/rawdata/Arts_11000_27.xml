'''Anti-art''' is a loosely used term applied to an array of concepts and attitudes that reject prior definitions of art and question art in general. Somewhat paradoxically, anti-art tends to conduct this questioning and rejection from the vantage point of art.&lt;ref&gt;David Graver. ''The aesthetics of disturbance: anti-art in avant-garde drama''. University of Michigan Press, 1995, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is associated with the [[Dada]] movement and is generally accepted as attributable to [[Marcel Duchamp]] pre-[[World War I]] around 1914, when he began to use [[found object]]s as art. It was used to describe revolutionary forms of art. The term was used later by the Conceptual artists of the 1960s to describe the work of those who claimed to have retired altogether from the practice of art, from the production of works which could be sold.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt;&lt;ref name="20th-Century art book"&gt;{{cite book |last=...|first=contributors Rachel Barnes|title=The 20th-Century art book.|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|isbn=0714835420|page=505|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An expression of anti-art may or may not take traditional form or meet the criteria for being defined as a work of art according to conventional standards.&lt;ref name="Anti-Art_and_the_Concept_of_Art" &gt;Paul N. Humble. "Anti-Art and the Concept of Art". In: "A companion to art theory". Editors: Paul Smith and Carolyn Wilde, Wiley-Blackwell, 2002, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"&gt;Martin Puchner. "Poetry of the revolution: Marx, manifestos, and the avant-gardes". Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, works of anti-art may express an outright rejection of having conventionally defined criteria as a means of defining what art is, and what it is not. Anti-artworks may reject conventional artistic standards altogether,&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Atwood. "The Triumph of Anti-Art: Conceptual and Performance Art in the Formation of Post-Modernism". Afterimage, Sep 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; or focus criticism only on certain aspects of art, such as the art market and [[high culture#High art|high art]]. Some anti-artworks may reject individualism in art,&lt;ref name="Theory of the Avant-Garde1"&gt;Peter Bürger "Theory of the Avant-Garde". Trans. Michael Shaw. Minneapolis: Minnesota. 1984, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strategies of Fame1"&gt;An Paenhuysen. [http://www.imageandnarrative.be/tulseluper/paenhuysen.htm "Strategies of Fame: The anonymous career of a Belgian surrealist".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926050531/http://www.imageandnarrative.be/tulseluper/paenhuysen.htm |date=2008-09-26 }} In: "Opening Peter Greenaway's Tulse Luper Suitcases". Guest edited by: Gray Kochhar-Lindgren, Image and Narrative, Vol.VI, issue 2 (12.) August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas some may reject "universality" as an accepted factor in art. Additionally, some forms of anti-art reject art entirely, or reject the idea that art is a separate realm or specialization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sadie Plant]]. "The most radical gesture: the Situationist International in a postmodern age". Taylor &amp; Francis, 1992, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-artworks may also reject art based upon a consideration of art as being oppressive of a segment of the population.&lt;ref name="Art_Is_Like_Cancer"&gt;Interview of Roger Taylor by Stewart Home. [http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/pol/taylor.htm "Art Is Like Cancer".] Mute Magazine. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-art artworks may articulate a disagreement with the generally supposed notion of there being a separation between art and life. Indeed, anti-art artworks may voice a question as to whether "art" really exists or not.&lt;ref&gt;Paul N. Humble. "Anti-Art and the Concept of Art". In: "A companion to art theory". Editors: Paul Smith and Carolyn Wilde, Wiley-Blackwell, 2002. Page 244&lt;/ref&gt; "Anti-art" has been referred to as a "paradoxical neologism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aristos.org/whatart/lights.htm|title=The Lights Go On and Off - WHAT ART IS Online, February 2002|website=www.aristos.org|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that its obvious opposition to art has been observed concurring with staples of twentieth-century art or "modern art", in particular [[art movement]]s that have self-consciously sought to transgress traditions or institutions.&lt;ref&gt;"Ernst Van Alphen, a Clark scholar from the Netherlands, suggested that Modernism itself can be characterized as anti-art in that since the earliest gestures of Dada and Futurism, art is seen as transformative and productive, breaking with institutions rather than destructive of images." Source: http://www.berkshirefinearts.com/?page=article&amp;article_id=128&amp;catID=3&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-art itself is not a distinct art movement, however. This would tend to be indicated by the time it spans—longer than that usually spanned by art movements. Some art movements though, are labeled "anti-art". The [[Dada]] movement is generally considered the first anti-art movement; the term anti-art itself is said to have been coined by Dadaist [[Marcel Duchamp]] around 1914, and his [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]]s have been cited as early examples of anti-art objects.&lt;ref&gt;This is one dictionary definition of anti-art: ''"A loosely used term that has been applied to works or attitudes that debunk traditional concepts of art. The term is said to have been coined by Marcel Duchamp in about 1914, and his ready-mades can be cited as early examples of the genre. Dada was the first anti-art movement, and subsequently the denunciation of art became commonplace—almost de rigueur—among the avant-garde."'' Note the emphasis on the fact that most art adopts the same principles attributed to the concept of "anti-art". Source: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O5-antiart.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor W. Adorno]] in ''Aesthetic Theory'' (1970) stated that "...even the abolition of art is respectful of art because it takes the truth claim of art seriously".&lt;ref&gt;T.W. Adorno. "Aesthetic Theory". 1970, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-art has become generally accepted by the artworld to be art, although some people still reject Duchamp's readymades as art, for instance the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] group of artists,&lt;ref name=tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/anti-art "Glossary: Anti-art"], [[Tate]].

Anti-art can take the form of art or not.&lt;ref name="Anti-Art_and_the_Concept_of_Art"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt; It is posited that anti-art need not even take the form of art, in order to embody its function as anti-art. This point is disputed. Some of the forms of anti-art which are art strive to reveal the conventional limits of art by expanding its properties.&lt;ref name="What's Neo about the Neo-Avant-Garde1" &gt;Hal Foster. "What's Neo about the Neo-Avant-Garde?". October, Vol. 70, "The Duchamp Effect", Autumn, 1994. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some instances of anti-art are suggestive of a reduction to what might seem to be fundamental elements or building blocks of art. Examples of this sort of phenomenon might include [[monochrome painting]]s, empty frames, [[list of silent musical compositions|silence as music]], [[aleatoricism|chance art]]. Anti-art is also often seen to make use of highly innovative materials and techniques, and well beyond—to include hitherto unheard of elements in visual art. These types of anti-art can be [[readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]], [[found object]] art, [[détournement]], [[combine painting]]s, [[appropriation (art)]], [[happening]]s, [[performance art]], and [[body art]].&lt;ref name="What's Neo about the Neo-Avant-Garde1"/&gt;

Anti-art can involve the renouncement of making art entirely.&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt; This can be accomplished through an art strike and this can also be accomplished through [[revolution]]ary [[activism]].&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt; An aim of anti-art can be to undermine or understate individual creativity. This may be accomplished through the utilization of [[found art|readymades]].&lt;ref name="Theory of the Avant-Garde1"/&gt; Individual creativity can be further downplayed by the use of [[industrial process]]es in the making of art. ''Anti-artists'' may seek to undermine individual creativity by producing their artworks anonymously.&lt;ref name="Pop art1" &gt;Tilman Osterwold. "Pop art". Taschen, 2003, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; They may refuse to show their artworks. They may refuse public recognition.&lt;ref name="Strategies of Fame1"/&gt; Anti-artists may choose to work collectively, in order to place less emphasis on individual identity and individual creativity. This can be seen in the instance of [[happening]]s. This is sometimes the case with "supertemporal" artworks, which are by design impermanent. Anti-artists will sometimes destroy their works of art.&lt;ref name="Strategies of Fame1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Towards an Acognitive Culture1" &gt;[[Henry Flynt]] interviewed by [[Stewart Home]]. [http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/interviews/flynt.htm "Towards an Acognitive Culture".] New York 8 March 1989. Smile 11, London Summer 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Some artworks made by anti-artists are purposely created to be destroyed. This can be seen in [[auto-destructive art]].

[[André Malraux]] has developed a concept of anti-art quite different from that outlined above. For Malraux, anti-art began with the 'Salon' or 'Academic' art of the nineteenth century which rejected the basic ambition of art in favour of a semi-photographic illusionism (often prettified). Of Academic painting, Malraux writes, 'All true painters, all those for whom painting is a value, were nauseated by these pictures – "Portrait of a Great Surgeon Operating" and the like – because they saw in them not a form of painting, but the negation of painting'. For Malraux, anti-art is still very much with us, though in a different form. Its descendants are commercial cinema and television, and popular music and fiction. The 'Salon', Malraux writes, 'has been expelled from painting, but elsewhere it reigns supreme'.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure. André Malraux's Theory of Art''. Amsterdam, Rodopi, 2009. pp.275-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Anti-art is also a tendency in the theoretical understanding of art and [[fine art]].

The philosopher Roger Taylor puts forward that art is a bourgeois ideology that has its origins with capitalism in "Art, an Enemy of the People". Holding a strong anti-essentialist position he states also that art has not always existed and is not universal but peculiar to Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/pol/taylor.htm|title=philosopher Roger Taylor on why art is an enemy of the people|website=www.stewarthomesociety.org|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim that is factually inaccurate as proven by many substantial archaeological findings on the Asian and African continents.

''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' by Larry Shiner is an art history book which fundamentally questions our understanding of art.
"The modern system of art is not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old." (Shiner 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;3)
Shiner presents (fine) art as a social construction that has not always existed throughout human history and could also disappear in its turn.

==History==

===Pre World War I===
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] rejected the separation between performer and spectator, life and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;North West Arts Association (Great Britain), Alexander Schouvaloff. "Place for the arts". Seel House Press, 1970, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] posited that art was a consequence of the [[social class|class system]] and therefore concluded that, in a [[communism|communist]] society, there would only be people who engage in the making of art and no "artists".&lt;ref&gt;Larry Shiner. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]''. University of Chicago Press, 2003, pp. 234, 236, 245,&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sapeck-La Joconde fumant la pipe.jpg|thumb|Illustration of ''Le rire'' (1887). First shown 1883 at an "Incohérents" exhibition by Arthur Sapeck (Eugène Bataille).|200px]]
Arguably the first movement that deliberately set itself in opposition to established art were the [[Incoherents]] in late 19th. century Paris. Founded by [[Jules Lévy]] in 1882, the Incoherents organized charitable art exhibitions intended to be satirical and humoristic, they presented "...drawings by people who can't draw..."&lt;ref&gt;"''...dessins exécutés par des gens qui ne savent pas dessiner...''"&lt;/ref&gt; and held masked balls with artistic themes, all in the greater tradition of [[Montmartre]] cabaret culture. While short lived – the last Incoherent show took place in 1896 – the movement was popular for its entertainment value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artsincoherents.info/|title=Les arts Incohérents|language=French|accessdate=2009-05-06 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090501185839/http://www.artsincoherents.info/ |archivedate= 1 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their commitment to satire, irreverence and ridicule they produced a number of works that show remarkable formal similarities to creations of the avant-garde of the 20th century: ready-mades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radicalart.info/things/readymade/index.html|title=Les Expositions des Arts Incohérents |work=Readymades (at Radical Art, Amsterdam)|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; monochromes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radicalart.info/nothing/monochrome/Incoherents/index.html|title=Early monochrome painting: Les Incohérents. |work=Monochromes (at Radical Art, Amsterdam)|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; empty frames&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radicalart.info/nothing/space/frames/index.html|title=Mey-Sonier: Tableau d'à Venir, 1883|work=Empty frames (at Radical Art, Amsterdam)|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and silence as music.&lt;ref&gt;Alphonse Allais: Marche Funèbre Composée pour les Funérailles d'un Grand Homme Sourd, 1884.

Bremen: Institut Français, 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada and constructivism===

Beginning in Switzerland, during [[World War I]], much of [[Dada]], and some aspects of the art movements it inspired, such as [[Neo-Dada]], [[Nouveau réalisme]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Tinguely]]: Art is revolution. National-Zeitung, Basle, 13 October 1967. "All machines are art. Even old, abandoned, rusty machines for sifting stones. (...) A beautiful oil refinery or your Johanniterbrücke, which are supposed to be solely functional, are important additions to modern art. So, art is also: the achievements of engineers and technicians, even if they express themselves unconsciously or purely functionally. Art is everything. (Do you think art ought to be made only by 'artists'?) And: art is everywhere – at my grandmother's – in the most incredible kitsch or under a rotten plank."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fluxus]], is considered anti-art.&lt;ref&gt;"Art is dead. Long live Dada."—[[Walter Serner]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Dada is like your hopes: nothing, like your paradise: nothing, like your idols: nothing; like your heroes: nothing, like your artists: nothing, like your religions: nothing' -[[Francis Picabia]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dadaists rejected cultural and intellectual conformity in art and more broadly in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Richter |first=Hans |year=1965 |title=Dada: Art and Anti-art |location= New York and Toronto |publisher= Oxford University Press |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For everything that art stood for, Dada was to represent the opposite.

Where art was concerned with traditional [[aesthetics]], Dada ignored aesthetics completely. If art was to appeal to sensibilities, Dada was intended to offend. Through their rejection of traditional culture and aesthetics the Dadaists hoped to destroy traditional culture and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;"We had lost confidence in our culture. Everything had to be demolished. We would begin again after the "[[tabula rasa]]". At the Cabaret Voltaire we began by shocking common sense, public opinion, education, institutions, museums, good taste, in short, the whole prevailing order." — [[Marcel Janco]]&lt;/ref&gt; Because they were more politicized, the Berlin dadas were the most radically anti-art within Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Shiner. "[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]". University of Chicago Press, 2003, p. 254. "the Berlin [[dada]]s were more radical (compared to the other dadas), believing that the only way to reintegrate art and life was to place both at the service of the socialist revolution."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, in the Berlin group, [[The Central Council of Dada for the World Revolution|the Dadaist revolutionary central council]] outlined the Dadaist ideals of radical [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Central Council of Dada for the World Revolution|The Dadaist revolutionary central council]]. [http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/DadaSurrealism/DadaSurrReadings/DadaGrmny.pdf "What is Dadaism and what does it want in Germany?".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913093050/http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/DadaSurrealism/DadaSurrReadings/DadaGrmny.pdf |date=2008-09-13 }} Tract, 1919. "Dadaism demands: 1) The international revolutionary union of all creative and intellectual men and women on the basis of radical Communism; (...) The immediate expropriation of property (socialization) and the communal feeding of all (...) Introduction of the simultaneist poem as a Communist state prayer."&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1913 [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]] challenged individual creativity and redefined art as a nominal rather than an intrinsic object.&lt;ref&gt;Duchamp quoted by Arturo Schwarz."The Complete Works of Marcel Duchamp'. London, Thames and Hudson, 1969, p.33."For me there is something else in addition to yes, no or indifferent – that is, for instance – the absence of investigations of that type. ... I am against the word 'anti' because it's a bit like atheist, as compared to believer. And the atheist is just as much of a religious man as the believer is, and an anti-artist is just as much of an artist as the other artist. Anartist would be much better, if I could change it, instead of anti-artist. Anartist, meaning no artist at all. That would be my conception. I don't mind being an anartist ... What I have in mind is that art may be bad, good or indifferent, but, whatever adjective is used, we must call it art, and bad art is still art in the same way as a bad emotion is still an emotion."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duchamp quoted by [[Dalia Judovitz]]. "Unpacking Duchamp: Art in Transit". Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1995. "No, no the word 'anti' annoys me a little, because whether you are anti or for, it's two sides of the same thing. And I would like to be completely – I don't know what you say – nonexistent, instead of being for or against... The idea of the artist as a sort of superman is comparatively recent. This I was going against. In fact, since I've stopped my artistic activity, I feel that I'm against this attitude of reverence the world has. Art, etymologically speaking, means to 'make.'

Originating in [[Russia]] in 1919, [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]] rejected art in its entirety and as a specific activity creating a universal aesthetic&lt;ref&gt;Varvara Stepanova: Lecture on Constructivism, 22 December 1921. In: Peter Noever: Aleksandr M. Rodchenko - Varvara F. Stepanova. The Future Is Our Only Goal. Munich: Prestel, 1991, pp. 174-178. "From here, Constructivism proceeds to the negation of all art in its entirety, and calls into question the necessity of a specific activity of art as creator of a universal aesthetic."&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of practices directed towards social purposes, "useful" to everyday life, such as graphic design, advertising and photography. In 1921, exhibiting at the [[5x5=25|5x5=25 exhibition]], [[Alexander Rodchenko]] created monochromes and proclaimed the end of painting.&lt;ref&gt;"I reduced painting to its logical conclusion and exhibited three canvases: red, blue, and yellow. I affirmed: this is the end of painting." — [[Alexander Rodchenko]].&lt;/ref&gt; For artists of the Russian Revolution, Rodchenko's radical action was full of utopian possibility. It marked the end of art along with the end of bourgeois norms and practices. It cleared the way for the beginning of a new Russian life, a new mode of production, a new culture.&lt;ref&gt;Rodchenko, A. and V. Stepanova (1975) [1920] 'The Programme of the Productivist Group', in Benton and Benton (eds), pp. 91-2. "1. Down with art, long live technical science. 2. Religion is a lie. Art is a lie. 3. Destroy the last remaining attachment of human thought to art. ... 6. The collective art of today is constructive life."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surrealism===
Beginning in the early 1920s, many [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact. [[Surrealism]] as a political force developed unevenly around the world, in some places more emphasis being put on artistic practices, while in others political practises outweighed. In other places still, Surrealist praxis looked to overshadow both the arts and politics. Politically, [[Surrealism]] was ultra-leftist, [[communist]], or [[anarchist]]. The split from Dada has been characterised as a split between anarchists and communists, with the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] as communist. In 1925, the [[Bureau of Surrealist Research]] declared their affinity for revolutionary politics.&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration of January 27, 1925". [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1925Surrealism.html Modern History Sourcebook: A Surrealist Manifesto, 1925]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s many Surrealists had strongly identified themselves with communism.&lt;ref&gt;"Manifesto for a Free Revolutionary Art"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generation-online.org/c/fcSurrealism1.html]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; Breton and his comrades supported [[Leon Trotsky]] and his [[International Left Opposition]] for a while, though there was an openness to anarchism that manifested more fully after World War II.

Leader [[André Breton]] was explicit in his assertion that [[Surrealism]] was above all a revolutionary movement. [[André Breton|Breton]] believed the tenets of [[Surrealism]] could be applied in any circumstance of life, and is not merely restricted to the artistic realm.&lt;ref&gt;[[André Breton]]. "The [[Surrealist Manifesto|first manifesto]]". 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Breton|Breton]]'s followers, along with the [[Communist Party]], were working for the "liberation of man." However, Breton's group refused to prioritize the [[proletarian]] struggle over radical creation such that their struggles with the Party made the late 1920s a turbulent time for both. Many individuals closely associated with [[André Breton|Breton]], notably [[Louis Aragon]], left his group to work more closely with the Communists. In 1929, [[André Breton|Breton]] asked Surrealists to assess their "degree of moral competence", and theoretical refinements included in the second ''[[Surrealist Manifesto|manifeste du surréalisme]]'' excluded anyone reluctant to commit to collective action&lt;ref name="pompidou"&gt;[http://www.cnac-gp.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Surrealistart-EN/ENS-Surrealistart-EN.htm Surrealist Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918070327/http://www.cnac-gp.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Surrealistart-EN/ENS-Surrealistart-EN.htm |date=September 18, 2012 }} from [[Centre Pompidou]]. Accessed March 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of World War II the surrealist group led by André Breton decided to explicitly embrace anarchism. In 1952 Breton wrote "It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself."&lt;ref name="anarchosurrealism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libcom.org/history/1919-1950-the-politics-of-surrealism |title=1919–1950: The politics of Surrealism by Nick Heath |publisher=Libcom.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letterism and the Situationist International===
{{Situationists |expanded=Concepts}}

Founded in the mid-1940s in France by [[Isidore Isou]], the [[Lettrism|Letterists]] utilised material appropriated from other films, a technique which would subsequently be developed (under the title of '[[détournement]]') in [[Situationist International|Situationist]] films. They would also often supplement the film with live performance, or, through the 'film-debate', directly involve the audience itself in the total experience. The most radical of the [[Lettrism|Letterist]] films, Wolman's ''The Anticoncept'' and [[Guy Debord|Debord]]'s ''Howls for Sade'' abandoned images altogether.

In 1956, recalling the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually, the founder of [[Lettrism]], [[Isidore Isou]], developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. Related to this, and arising out of it, is excoördism, the current incarnation of the Isouian movement, defined as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

In 1960, [[Isidore Isou]] created supertemporal art: a device for inviting and enabling an audience to participate in the creation of a work of art. In its simplest form, this might involve nothing more than the inclusion of several blank pages in a book, for the reader to add his or her own contributions.

In Japan in the late 1950s, [[Group Kyushu]] was an edgy, experimental and rambunctious art group. They ripped and burned canvasses, stapled corrugated cardboard, nails, nuts, springs, metal drill shavings, and burlap to their works, assembled all kinds of unwieldy junk assemblages, and were best known for covering much of their work in tar. They also occasionally covered their work in urine and excrement. They tried to bring art closer to everyday life, by incorporating objects from daily life into their work, and also by exhibiting and performing their work outside on the street for everyone to see.

Other similar anti-art groups included [http://www.artfact.com/features/viewStyle.cfm?genreRef=K714FO8OVR Neo-Dada] (Neo-Dadaizumu Oganaizazu), [http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/g/gutai Gutai] ([[Gutai]] Bijutsu Kyokai), and Hi-Red-Center. Influenced in various ways by [[L'Art Informel]], these groups and their members worked to foreground material in their work: rather than seeing the art work as representing some remote referent, the material itself and the artists' interaction with it became the main point. The freeing up of gesture was another legacy of L'Art Informel, and the members of Group Kyushu took to it with great verve, throwing, dripping, and breaking material, sometimes destroying the work in the process.

Beginning in the 1950s in France, the [[Letterist International]] and after the [[Situationist International]] developed a [[dialectic]]al viewpoint, seeing their task as ''superseding'' art, abolishing the notion of art as a separate, specialized activity and transforming it so it became part of the fabric of everyday life. From the Situationist's viewpoint, art is [[revolution]]ary or it is nothing. In this way, the Situationists saw their efforts as completing the work of both Dada and [[surrealism]] while abolishing both.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Debord. [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/debord/8.htm " The Society of the Spectacle"]. Thesis 187 and 191. 1967. Translation by [[Ken Knabb]] in 2002."The ''positive'' significance of the modern decomposition and destruction of all art is that the language of communication has been lost. The ''negative'' implication of this development is that a common language can no longer take the form of the unilateral conclusions that characterized the art of historical societies — ''belated'' portrayals of ''someone else's'' dialogueless life which accepted this lack as inevitable — but must now be found in a praxis that unifies direct activity with its own appropriate language.
The point is to actually participate in the community of dialogue and the game with time that up till now have merely been ''represented'' by poetic and artistic works." "Dadaism and surrealism were the two currents that marked the end of modern art. Though they were only partially conscious of it, they were contemporaries of the last great offensive of the revolutionary proletarian movement, and the defeat of that movement, which left them trapped within the very artistic sphere whose decrepitude they had denounced, was the fundamental reason for their immobilization. Dadaism and surrealism were historically linked yet also opposed to each other. This opposition involved the most important and radical contributions of the two movements, but it also revealed the internal inadequacy of their one-sided critiques. Dadaism sought to ''abolish art without realizing it''; surrealism sought to ''realize art without abolishing it''. The critical position since developed by the ''situationists'' has shown that the abolition and realization of art are inseparable aspects of a single ''transcendence of art''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Internationale Situationist (no. 1, Paris, June 1958) "Art need no longer be an account of past sensations. It can become the direct organization of more highly evolved sensations. It is a question of producing ourselves, not things that enslave us."&lt;/ref&gt;
The situationists renounced the making of art entirely.&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt;

The members of the [[Situationist International]] liked to think they were probably the most radical,&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Kaufman. "The Columbia history of twentieth-century French thought". Editor: Lawrence D. Kritzman, Columbia University Press, 2007, p. 104. "In the view of some (including the principal protagonists of the movement themselves), Situationism was the century's finest and most radical form of subversion. It is claimed to have been at the heart of the events of May 1968, whose spirit it embodied, with its radical critique of all forms of alienation imposed by capitalist society (renamed the "society of spectacle" by the Situationists)".&lt;/ref&gt; politicized,&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt; well organized, and theoretically productive anti-art movement, reaching their apex with the student protests and [[general strike]] of [[May 1968 in France]], a view endorsed by others including the academic [[Martin Puchner]].&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt;

In 1959 [[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio]] proposed [[Industrial Painting]] as an "industrial-inflationist art"&lt;ref&gt;[[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio]]. [http://www.notbored.org/gallizio.html Manifesto of Industrial Painting: For a unitary applied art]. ''[[Notizie Arti Figurative]]'' No. 9 (1959). In French: ''[[Situationist International|Internationale Situationniste]]'' no.3 (1959). In English: [[Molly Klein]] translated the [[original]] Italian version into English (1997). "The machine may very well be the appropriate instrument for the creation of an industrial-inflationist art, based on the Anti-Patent; the new industrial culture will be strictly "Made Amongst People" or not at all! The time of the Scribes is over."(...) "When thousands of painters who today labor at the non-sense of detail will have the possibilities which machines offer, there will be no more giant stamps, called paintings to satisfy the investment of value, but thousands of kilometers of fabric offered in the streets, in markets, for barter, allowing millions of people to enjoy them and exciting the experience of arrangement."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Dada and later===
{{Main|Neo-Dada}}
Similar to Dada, in the 1960s, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an anti-art sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists used their minimal performances to blur the distinction between life and art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolf Vostell]], 1972 (Postcard). "[[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]] has qualified the object into art. I have qualified life into art."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Vautier]]. [http://radicalart.info/concept/ArtAgainstArt/Ben/index.html "Pas d'Art" (No art).] 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 [[Henry Flynt]] began to campaign for an anti-art position.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Oren (1993) Anti-Art as the End of Cultural History, [[Performing Arts Journal]], volume 15, issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Flynt wanted [[avant-garde]] [[art]] to become superseded by the terms of ''veramusement'' and ''brend'' – [[neologism]]s meaning approximately pure [[recreation]].

In 1963 [[George Maciunas]] advocated revolution, "living art, anti-art" and "non art reality to be grasped by all peoples".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Maciunas]]. [http://www.artnotart.com/fluxus/gmaciunas-manifesto.html Fluxus Manifesto], 1963. "Purge the world of bourgeois sickness, "intellectual", professional and commercialized culture, purge the world of dead art, imitation, artificial art, abstract art, illusionistic art, mathematical art, – purge the world of "Europanism"! [...] PROMOTE A REVOLUTIONARY FLOOD AND TIDE IN ART, [...] promote NON ART REALITY to be grasped by all peoples, not only critics, dilettantes and professionals ... FUSE the cadres of cultural, social &amp; political revolutionaries into united front &amp; action."&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Maciunas|Maciunas]] strived to uphold his stated aims of demonstrating the artist's 'non-professional status...his dispensability and inclusiveness' and that 'anything can be art and anyone can do it.'&lt;ref&gt;A 1965 Inventory list by Maciunas, quoted in Mr Fluxus, p88&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the Dada-influenced [[art group]] [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] declared that revolutionary art should be "an integral part of life, as in primitive society, and not an appendage to wealth".&lt;ref name="Ben Morea: art and anarchism"&gt;Hinderer, Eve. [http://www.16beavergroup.org/monday/archives/001031print.html Ben Morea: art and anarchism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425191200/http://www.16beavergroup.org/monday/archives/001031print.html |date=April 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Mask disrupted cultural events in New York by giving made up flyers of art events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks.&lt;ref name="The Assault on Culture 1"&gt;[[Stewart Home]]. [http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/sp/assault.htm "The Assault on Culture: Utopian currents from Lettrisme to Class War"]. Introduction to the Lithuanian edition. (Ist edition Aporia Press and Unpopular Books, London 1988.) {{ISBN|0-948518-88-X}}. "In the sixties Black Mask disrupted reified cultural events in New York by making up flyers giving the dates, times and location of art events and giving these out to the homeless with the lure of the free drink that was on offer to the bourgeoisie rather than the lumpen proletariat; I reused the ruse just as effectively in London in the 1990s to disrupt literary events."&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers|Motherfuckers]] were to grow out of a combination of Black Mask and another group called Angry Arts.

The BBC aired an interview with Duchamp conducted by Joan Bakewell in 1966 which expressed some of Duchamps more explicit Anti-Art ideas.
Duchamp compared art with religion, whereby he stated that he wished to do away with art the same way many have done away with religion. Duchamp goes on to explain to the interviewer that "the word art etymologically means to do", that art means activity of any kind, and that it is our society that creates "purely artificial" distinctions of being an artist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hn5f4u3PUVoC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq=bbc+1966+interview+duchamp+joan+bakewell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=H3EwaV7Wt5&amp;sig=btLMQ2GJA3YOwZIPQNU-Oe0KFRg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9bjcUJiqJaKN0wXCk4DAAw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Marcel Duchamp: Artist of the Century] edited by Rudolf E.

During the 1970s, [[King Mob]] was responsible for various attacks on art galleries. According to the philosopher Roger Taylor the concept of art is not universal but is an invention of bourgeois ideology helping to promote this social order. He compares it to a cancer that colonises other forms of life so that it becomes difficult to distinguish one from the other.&lt;ref name=Art_Is_Like_Cancer/&gt;

[[Stewart Home]] called for an Art Strike between 1990 and 1993. Unlike earlier art-strike proposals such as that of [[Gustav Metzger]] in the 1970s, it was not intended as an opportunity for artists to seize control of the means of distributing their own work, but rather as an exercise in propaganda and psychic warfare aimed at smashing the entire art world rather than just the gallery system. As [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] had done in the 1960s, [[Stewart Home]] disrupted cultural events in London in the 1990s by giving made up flyers of literary events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks.&lt;ref name="The Assault on Culture 1"/&gt;

The [[K Foundation]] was an art foundation that published a series of [[Situationist International|Situationist]]-inspired press adverts and extravagant subversions in the art world. Most notoriously, when their plans to use [[banknotes]] as part of a work of art fell through, they burnt a million [[pound sterling|pounds]] in cash.

[[Punk visual art|Punk]] has developed anti-art positions. Some "industrial music" bands describe their work as a form of "cultural terrorism" or as a form of "anti-art". The term is also used to describe other intentionally provocative art forms, such as [[nonsense verse]].

==As art==

Paradoxically, most forms of anti-art have gradually been completely accepted by the art establishment as normal and conventional forms of art.&lt;ref&gt;Paul N. Humble. "Anti-Art and the Concept of Art". In: "A companion to art theory". Editors: Paul Smith and Carolyn Wilde, Wiley-Blackwell, 2002, p. 246. "the readymade has been appropriated as a theoretical paradigm in much contemporary art-school theory."&lt;/ref&gt; Even the movements which rejected art with the most virulence are now collected by the most prestigious cultural institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gallix. [http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=20090416120529166 "The resurrection of Guy Debord".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704124307/http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=20090416120529166 |date=2009-07-04 }} ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 March 2009. "Guy-Ernest Debord would be spinning in his grave – had he not been cremated following his suicide in 1994. The arch-rebel who prided himself on fully deserving society's "universal hatred" has now officially been recognised as a "national treasure" in his homeland. The French government has duly stepped in to prevent Yale University from acquiring his personal archives (...) It's difficult to convey how bizarre it is to hear Christine Albanel – Sarkozy's minister of culture – describing the revolutionary Debord as 'one of the last great French intellectuals' of the second half of the 20th century."&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp's readymades are still regarded as anti-art by the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]],&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; who also say that anti-art has become conformist, and describe themselves as [[anti-anti-art]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuck on the Turner Prize"/&gt;

'''Applied aesthetics''' is the application of the branch of philosophy of aesthetics to cultural constructs.
{{TOC right}}

==Architecture and interior design==

Although structural integrity, cost, the nature of building materials, and the functional utility of the building contribute heavily to the design process, architects can still apply aesthetic considerations to buildings and related [[architecture|architectural]] structures. Common aesthetic design principles include ornamentation, edge delineation, texture, flow, solemnity, symmetry, color, granularity, the interaction of sunlight and shadows, transcendence, and harmony.

[[Interior design]]ers, being less constrained by structural concerns, have a wider variety of applications to appeal to aesthetics. They may employ color, color harmony, wallpaper, ornamentation, furnishings, fabrics, textures, lighting, various floor treatments, as well as adhere to aesthetic concepts such as [[feng shui]].

==Digital art==

A new art form struggling for acceptance is [[digital art]], a by-product of computer programming that raises new questions about what truly constitutes art.  Although paralleling many of the aesthetics in traditional media, digital art can additionally draw upon the aesthetic qualities of cross-media tactile relationships; interactivity; autonomous generativity; complexity and interdependence of relationships; suspense; and playfulness.

Artists working in this type of art are often forced to justify their use of a computer rather than a traditional medium, leading to, like the debate over Warhol's "Brillo Pad Boxes", a question of what constitutes art.

The criticisms of digital art are many. For example, graphics programs allow perfect shading to be achieved with little to no effort. In other types of programs, there is a sense that because of the variety of tools, filters, distortions, etc., that an artist has a veritable image factory at their disposal. The various criticisms ultimately come down to the issue of "what effort is the artist putting into their work?"

The 3d art community frequently references that while the programs they utilize render and shade the objects, their efforts are more akin to the sculptor or architect, presenting an aesthetically arranged, lighted, and textured scene. The users of the other programs such as Photoshop or Gimp point out that while they may have many tools at their disposal, the art itself must be that much more detailed and imaginative to stand out. In both cases there is the challenge of overcoming the barriers of limited technology and the lack of direct contact with one's medium.

==Education and social sciences==

Educators are also interested in how aesthetic designs influence the ways that students think and learn. Some historical figures like [[John Dewey]] have approached education through aesthetics. More recently, Elliot Eisner and jan jagodzinski have reopened the debate. Other researchers with [[postmodern]] or [[poststructural]] influences have done the same, these include Cleo H. Cherryholmes and [[Michel Foucault]]. Aesthetics in education has been linked to [[pragmatism]] as well as other areas of curriculum development and implementation.

See ''Understanding Curriculum," Chapter 11, Understanding Curriculum as Aesthetic Text, by William F. Pinar, William M. Reynolds, Patrick Slattery and Peter Taubman (1995) for more information.

==Fashion design==

[[Fashion design]]ers use a variety of techniques to allow people to express the truth about their unconscious minds by way of their clothing. To create wearable personality designers use fabric, cut, colour, scale, references to the past, texture, color harmony, distressing, transparency, insignia, accessories, beading and embroidery.
It is also used to find the average size of things, to make a product suitable for a high number of customers.

==Film, television, and video==

[[Film]] combines many diverse disciplines, each of which may have their own rules of aesthetics. The aesthetics of [[cinematography]] are closely related to still [[photography]], but the movement of the subject(s), or the camera and the intensities, colors, and placement of the [[lighting]] are highly important. [[Sound recording]], editing, and mixing are other, highly important areas of film, often closely related with the [[Film score|musical score]]. As in [[Theatre]], [[art direction]], in the design of the sets and shooting locations also applies, as well as [[costume design]] and [[makeup]]. All of these disciplines are closely inter-twined and must be brought together by the aesthetic sensibilities of the [[Film director|director]].

[[Montage sequence|Montage]], or editing is probably the one discipline unique to film, video, and television. The timing, rhythm and progression of shots form the ultimate composition of the film. This procedure is one of the most critical element of [[post production]], and incorporates sound editing and mixing, as well as the design and execution of digital [[special effects]].

In the case of a [[video installation]], the method of presentation becomes critical. The work may be screened on a simple [[video monitor|monitor]], projected on a wall or other surface, or incorporated into a larger sculptural installation. A video installation may also involve sound, with similar considerations to be made based on speaker design and placement, volume, and tone.

==Gastronomy==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2007}}
{{Original research|section|date=December 2007}}
Although [[culinary|food]] is a basic and frequently experienced commodity, careful attention to the aesthetic possibilities of foodstuffs can turn eating into [[gastronomy]]. Chefs inspire our aesthetic enjoyment through the visual sense using colour and arrangement; they inspire our senses of taste and smell using [[spices]], diversity/contrast, anticipation, seduction, and decoration/garnishes. In regard to [[drinking water]], there are formal criteria for aesthetic value including [[odour]], [[colour]], [[total dissolved solids]] and clarity. There are numerical standards in the [[United States|U.S.]] for aesthetic acceptability of these parameters.

Note, however, a use of a word translated to "culinary" in Adorno's aesthetics. Adorno distinguishes between technically accurate and "beautiful" musical interpretation, and an interpretation higher which brings out the "truth" in the musical text: interpretations more rehearsed, with more time for rehearsal, but which might sound strange to audiences pandered-to by popular conductors (perhaps in the way Glenn Gould enstranges the music of Beethoven).

Unfortunately for the ordinary reader of Adorno, this isn't something technical such as "original instruments". It is instead the work of art that doesn't pander to what the audience "wants"...its whims.

This is linked to a Marxist interpretation which instead of treating the audience as an all-powerful "customer" adopts a teacherly or even priestly stance "above" the mere audience, something only the most "snobbish" of French chefs would dare, proposing to teach it to like Higher Things.

There are rarefied forms of *haute* cuisine; but note that common sense usually has a horselaugh about precious Yuppies eating designer food which it withholds about concert-goers listening to Berg; your man in the street merely thinks the latter crowd to be odd jobs, and doesn't resent them, meaning that ethical judgements play a role in aesthetic judgements that specialists in ethics, and specialists in aesthetics, systematically disregard...but which artists such as Tolstoy regarded as central.

Based on Adorno's theory of the (merely) culinary as not being "art", this would seem to mean that it is a joke, for an Adornoite (if such a person exists meaningfully), to treat cooking as an art form or eating as art appreciation.

Monty Python would often reverberate with this sort of arcana in a strange way: in the Mr. Creosote passage of The Meaning of Life, an enormously fat man is persuaded by the fawning waiter to have one more sweet whereupon Mr. Creosote throws up all over the dining room. Note that the scene has more claims to be art, despite being nauseating, than designer food.

This MAY be an unconscious comment on any theory of art that blindly equates "fine dining" and a visit to the picture galleries, a sort of tourist equation in which picture galleries are overrun in fact by post-prandial Mr. Creosotes. Even the ordinary man in the street would say that the starving artist visiting the gallery has a "better" apprehension of the higher, more inner, more elusive aura of the art work than Mr. Creosote, which means that for some authors, including Adorno, there is a nexus between ethics (which nearly tracks aesthetics polyphonically, where we use "good" and "bad" in ethics to characterise people and their deeds, and in aesthetics to judge what to buy).

The possibility of a rejection of the culinary in art starts with Kant's theory of the sublime but does not end there; post Holocaust (with its Nazis playing Bach: with Adorno's questions about poetry after Auschwitz) the culinary, and whether the German officer enjoying a "fine" meal has much of anything to do with art, become important aesthetic questions.

A Marxist theory of art would probably conclude that the chef cannot be an artist, lacking autonomy and beholden to the customer, Mr. Creosote, in all regards.

==Humor==

{{Further|Humor|Jokes|Mathematical humor}}
There is a developed theory of the aesthetics of jokes and humor, including a mathematical and logical analysis.

==Industrial design==

[[Industrial Design]]: Designers need many aesthetic qualities to improve the marketability of manufactured products: smoothness, shininess/reflectivity, texture, pattern, curviness, color, simplicity, usability, velocity, symmetry, naturalness, and modernism.
The staff of the Design Aesthetics section focuses on design, appearance and the way people perceive products. Design aesthetics is interested in the appearance of products; the explanation and meaning of this appearance is studied mainly in terms of social and cultural factors. The distinctive focus of the section is research and education in the field of sensory modalities in relation to product design. These fields of attention generate design baggage that enables engineers to design products, systems, and services, and match them to the correct field of use.

==Information technology==

Aesthetics in [[information technology]] has focused upon the study of [[human-computer interaction]] and creating [[user-friendly]] devices and [[software applications]]. [[Software]] itself has aesthetic dimensions ("[[software aesthetics]]"), as do information-technology-mediated processes and experiences such as computer [[video games]] and [[virtual reality]] simulations. [[Digital culture]] is a distinct aesthetic to judge the appeal of digital environments such as [[Web browser]]s, [[website]]s, and icons, as well as visual and aural art produced exclusively with digital technologies. The notion of [[cyberspace]] has sometimes been linked to the concept of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].

Aesthetics in information technology do also apply to the act of designing [[software]] itself. Numerous [[programmers]] profess to experiencing a dimension of [[elegance]] in the functionality and structuring of software at the [[source code]] level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/front/node3.html Preface to the First Edition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a short, powerful expression that clearly expresses the intent of the code can be considered "beautiful" to the poor programmer charged with maintaining said code. This contrasts with code that is (as code all too often is) short, cryptic, unclear, and unnecessarily "clever". In-line documentation, while not strictly code, can be considered something a programmer would need to be good at in order to write beautiful code. Correctly done, documentation can accentuate the effect of beautiful code, when it is clear, concise, explains the intent of the programmer, and expands the understanding that one can gain by simply looking at the code. Comments that are redundant (only explain what the code already explains), cryptic, and overly long or short can detract from beautiful code. Aesthetics in programming can also have a practical level: Under the right conditions, elegant code can run faster and more efficiently, and (most importantly) be less prone to errors.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Knuth,  "Literate Programming", http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this would say that the need to justify "good design" by reference to "cost savings" means that "good design" isn't "art" insofar as art is autonomous, and many aestheticians would have to say that art emerges in applications only in excess of cost savings. In information technology, theorists of "user friendliness" have to justify their "user friendly" applications and often disregard basic statistics when most users like a system, but a significant minority hate it.

That is, they may discard the standard deviation of their data in order to sell a good design for the best price, and this has nothing to do with art insofar as art is a useful signifier (if you cost-justify everything you are a businessman and not an artist).

A folk phenomenon among real programmers is in fact their frequent hatred of practice described in books as best practice and good design. A Marxist theory of industrial "art" would ascribe this to alienation, in which subaltern programmers never produce code they own in any meaningful sense, with the problem that the same sort of alienation, soldiering, and bloody-mindedness appeared, it seems, in Soviet computing shops.

The most sophisticated writings on the topic of aesthetics are to be found in the late [[Edsger Dijkstra|Edsger Wybe Dijkstra's]] corpus of papers and notes on computing: in Dijkstra, the art is real, but Ying with respect to the Yang of applications; Dijkstra seemed to have refused any analysis of programming as other than applied mathematics and, strange to say, never pursued what Adorno (the midcentury theoretician of whom Dijkstra was apparently unaware) called a purely culinary elegance...despite the protests of others that his work was "hard to digest", in Adorno's words not very culinary.

Dijkstra's beauty refused the notion of accessibility as do many "artistic" works ancient and modern: it was hard as is the Grosse Fuge, Beethoven's syncopated and neo-primitive late movement. In fact, no aesthetician makes "user friendliness" canonical and necessary in a work of art, strange to say in an era when supposedly the masses rule through the market; for most art theorists, it is nice if the canaille can enjoy some pretty rondo of Mozart and whistle it on the street, but would deny that this property must be shared by the Masonic prelude and fugue or the Requiem mass.

This makes strange any claim that a programmer making his work "user friendly" to all comers is some sort of artist by virtue of that. For Dijsktra, truth was primary, and beauty the automatic result.

==Landscape design==

[[Landscape architecture|Landscape designers]] draw upon design elements such as axis, line, landform, horizontal and vertical planes, texture, and scale to create aesthetic variation within the landscape. They may additionally make use of aesthetic elements such as pools or fountains of water, plants, seasonal variance, stonework, fragrance, exterior lighting, statues, and lawns.

==Literature==

{{main|Literary merit}}
In [[poetry]], [[short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s and [[non-fiction]], authors use a variety of techniques to appeal to our aesthetic values. Depending on the type of writing an author may employ rhythm, illustrations, structure, time shifting, juxtaposition, dualism, imagery, fantasy, suspense, analysis, humor/cynicism, and thinking aloud.

==Maps==

Aesthetics in [[cartography]] relates to the visual experience of map reading and can take two forms: responses to the map itself as an aesthetic object (e.g., through detail, colour, and form) and also the subject of the map symbolised, often the landscape (e.g., a particular expression of terrain which forms an imagined visual experience of the aesthetic).

Cartographers make aesthetic judgments when designing maps to ensure that the content forms a clear expression of the theme(s). Antique maps are perhaps especially revered due to their aesthetic value, which may seem to be derived from their styles of ornamentation. As such, aesthetics are often wrongly considered to be a by-product of design. If it is taken that aesthetic judgments are produced within a certain social context, they are fundamental to the cartographer's symbolisation and as such are integral to the function of maps.

==Marketing==

As opposed to Industrial Design, which focuses on the aesthetic qualities of consumer products (see below), the use of aesthetics in marketing concerns itself with the "trade dress" of a product, such as its branding, its commercial representation, or the reputation of its producer. Marketing professionals may tickle the consumer's aesthetic appreciation of sassyness, [[sophistication]], color-harmony, stylishness, catchy jingles, slogans, craftsmanship, soothingness, attentiveness, authenticity, or the related perceived experiences associated with product consumption.

Marketing consists of intriguing the human mind to think in a direction where it would not have done so previously - or not without outside input. Human curiosity, self gain or mental adjustment is what drives marketing development itself.

==Mathematics==

{{Main|Mathematical beauty}}
{{Further|mathematical humor}}
The aesthetics of [[mathematics]] are often compared with music and poetry. Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] expressed his views on the indescribable beauty of mathematics when he said "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful." Math appeals to the "senses" of logic, order, novelty, elegance, and discovery. Some concepts in math with specific aesthetic application include sacred ratios in [[geometry]], the intuitiveness of axioms, the complexity and intrigue of fractals, the solidness and regularity of [[polyhedra]], and the [[serendipity]] of relating theorems across disciplines.  There is a developed aesthetic and theory of humor in [[mathematical humor]].

==Music==

{{main|Aesthetics of music}}
Some of the aesthetic elements expressed in [[music]] include lyricism, [[harmony]], hypnotism, emotiveness, temporal dynamics, volume dynamics, resonance, playfulness, color, subtlety, elatedness, depth, and mood (see [[musical development]]). Aesthetics in music are often believed to be highly sensitive to their context: what sounds good in modern [[rock music]] might sound terrible in the context of the early [[baroque music|baroque]] age.

==Neuroesthetics==

[[Cognitive science]] has also considered aesthetics, with the advent of [[neuroesthetics]], pioneered by [[Semir Zeki]], which seeks to explain the prominence of great art as an embodiment of biological principles of the brain, namely that great works of art capture the essence of things just as vision and the brain capture the essentials of the world from the ever-changing stream of sensory input. ''See also'' [[Vogelkop bowerbird]].

==Performing arts==

[[Theater|Performing arts]] appeal to our aesthetics of storytelling, grace, balance, class, timing, strength, shock, humor, costume, irony, beauty, drama, suspense, and sensuality. Whereas live stage performance is usually constrained by the physical reality at hand, film performance can further add the aesthetic elements of large-scale action, fantasy, and a complex interwoven musical [[film score|score]]. [[Performance art]] often consciously mixes the aesthetics of several forms. [[Role-playing games]] are sometimes seen as a performing art with an aesthetic structure of their own, called [[role-playing game theory|RPG theory]].

==Two-dimensional and plastic arts==

Aesthetic considerations within the [[visual arts]] are usually associated with the sense of [[visual perception|vision]]. A painting or sculpture, however, is also perceived spatially by recognized associations and context, and even to some extent by the senses of smell, hearing, and touch. The form of the work can be subject to an aesthetic as much as the content.

In painting, the aesthetic convention that we see a three-dimensional representation rather than a two-dimensional canvas is so well understood that most people do not realize that they are making an aesthetic interpretation. This notion is the basis of [[abstract impressionism]].

In the United States during the postwar period, the "push-pull" theories of [[Hans Hofmann]], positing a relation between color and perceived depth, strongly influenced a generation of prominent abstract painters, many of whom studied under Hofmann and were generally associated with [[abstract expressionism]]. Hofmann's general attitude toward abstraction as virtually a moral imperative for the serious painter was also extremely influential.

Some aesthetic effects available in visual arts include variation, juxtaposition, repetition, field effects, symmetry/asymmetry, perceived mass, subliminal structure, linear dynamics, tension and repose, pattern, contrast, perspective, 3 dimensionality, movement, rhythm, unity/Gestalt, matrixiality and proportion.

==Urban life==

[[Image:Clifton suspension bridge from hotwells 600.jpg|thumb|300px|Towns and cities have been planned with aesthetics in mind; here in [[Bristol]] (England), 19th century private sector development was designed to appear attractive.]]
Over half of mankind lives in cities; although it represents a lofty goal, [[urban planning|planning]] and achieving urban aesthetics ([[beautification]]) involves a good deal of historical luck, happenstance, and indirect gestalt. Nevertheless, aesthetically pleasing cities share certain traits: ethnic and cultural variety, numerous microclimates that promote a diversity of vegetation, sufficient public transportation, Public art and freedom of expression in the community in the forms of sculpture, [[graffiti]] and [[street art]], a range of build-out (or zoning) that creates both densely and sparsely populated areas, scenic neighboring geography (oceans or mountains), public spaces and events such as [[park]]s and [[parade]]s, musical variety through local radio or street musicians, and enforcement of laws that abate noise, crime, and pollution.

==Website Design==

Recent research suggests that the visual aesthetics of computer interface is a strong determinant of users’ satisfaction and pleasure. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses found that users’ perceptions consist of different main dimensions. Lavie and Tractinsky found two main dimension which they termed  “classical aesthetics”  and “expressive aesthetics”.&lt;ref&gt;Lavie, T., &amp; Tractinsky, N. (2004). Assessing Dimensions of Perceived Visual Aesthetics of Websites. International Journal of Human Computer Studies , 269-298.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''Classical Aesthetics'' - pertains to aesthetic notions that presided from antiquity until the 18th century. These notions emphasize orderly and clear design and are closely related to many of the 	design rules advocated by usability experts.
*''Expressive Aesthetics'' - created by the designers’ creativity and originality and by the ability to break design conventions.
While both dimensions of perceived aesthetic are drawn from a pool of aesthetic judgments, they are clearly distinguishable from each other. &lt;br /&gt;
In a recent study Moshagen and Thielsch found four core dimensions of website aesthetics:&lt;ref&gt;Moshagen, M. &amp; Thielsch, M. T. (2010). Facets of visual aesthetics. In: ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', 68 (10), 689-709.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Simplicity
* Diversity
* Colors
* Craftsmanship

Simplicity and diversity have repeatedly been treated as formal parameters of aesthetic objects throughout the history of empirical aesthetics. Colors are a very critical property of aesthetic objects. Craftsmanship addresses the skillful and coherent integration of the relevant design dimensions. While simplicity is highly correlated to classical aesthetics as mentioned by Lavie and Tractinsky, the other three factors could be treated as deeper differentiation of expressive aesthetics.

&lt;br /&gt;
'''Best practices for aesthetic Website Design'''&lt;br /&gt;
•	Create visual clues based on groupings; related items or links are grouped together while unrelated items are separated.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use headings and subheadings to allow visual scanning of content.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use headings, subheadings, font sizes, bold fonts and italic fonts in proportion to the importance of the item.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Align elements on a page so that they are all visually connected; size all elements on the page to create balance and unity; nothing should look out of place unless you have a specific reason for the effect.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Choose a font style that supports the site atmosphere and stick to it; limit styles to 2 at the most.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use images and photos for visual appeal and to communicate ideas.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use one set of design elements across your website.

'''Website Design Aesthetics and Credibility''' &lt;br /&gt;
Website design influences user’s perception of site credibility. One of the factors that influences whether users stay or go on a web page is the page aesthetics. Another reason may involve a user's judgment about the site's credibility. Findings indicate that when the same content is presented using different levels of aesthetic treatment, the content with a higher aesthetic treatment was judged as having higher credibility. We call this the amelioration effect of visual design and aesthetics on content credibility. Holmes suggests that this effect is operational within the first few seconds in which a user views a web page. Given the same content, a higher aesthetic treatment will increase perceived credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, J., &amp; Robins, D. (2008). Aesthetics and Credibility in Web Site Design. Information Processing and Management: an International Journal , 386-399.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Aurora Borealis''''' is an 1865 painting by [[Frederic Edwin Church]] of the [[aurora borealis]] and the Arctic expedition of [[Isaac Israel Hayes]]. The painting measures {{conv|142.3x212.2|cm}} and is now owned by the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].&lt;ref name=Smithson1&gt;{{cite web|title=Aurora Borealis|url=http://www.americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=4806|publisher=[[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Eos|title=Aurora Painting Pays Tribute to Civil War's End|last=Love|first=Jeffrey J.|publisher=American Geophysical Union|volume=96|doi=10.1029/2015EO035713| date=September 2015 |url=https://eos.org/features/aurora-painting-pays-tribute-to-civil-wars-end}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
''Aurora Borealis'' is based on two separate sketches.&lt;ref&gt;Truettner, W. H. (1970). "The Genesis of Frederic Edwin Church's Aurora Boreolis". ''Art Quarterly'', XXXI, Fall 1968, pp. 266–83.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first incident was an aurora witnessed by Church's pupil, the [[Arctic]] explorer [[Isaac Israel Hayes|Isaac I. Hayes]]. Hayes provided a sketch and description of the aurora borealis display he witnessed one January evening. Coinciding with Hayes' furthest northern movement into what he named Cape Leiber, the aurora borealis appeared over the peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Howat |first=John K. |title=Frederic Church|year=2005|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-10988-1 |pages=120–121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQh2gpT0KFIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing the event, Hayes wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The light grew by degrees more and more intense, and from irregular bursts it settled into an almost steady sheet of brightness... The exhibition, at first tame and quiet, became in the end startling in its brilliancy. The broad dome above me is all ablaze... The colour of the light was chiefly red, but this was not constant, and every hue mingled in the fierce display. Blue and yellow streamers were playing in the lurid fire; and, sometimes starting side by side from the wide expanse of the illuminated arch, they melt into each other, and throw a ghostly glare of green into the face and over the landscape. Again this green overrides the red; blue and orange clasp each other in their rapid flight; violet darts tear through a broad flush of yellow, and countless tongues of white flame, formed of these uniting streams, rush aloft and lick the skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayes|first=Issac Israel |title=The Open Polar Sea: A Narrative of a Voyage of Discovery Towards the North Pole, in the Schooner "United States" |year=1867|publisher=Sampson Low, Son and Marston|location=London|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ltY35Ap35moC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Description and influences ==

The iconography of the painting suggested personal and nationalistic references. The peak in the painting had been named after Church during Hayes's expedition. ''Aurora Borealis'' incorporated details of Hayes' ship, drawn from a sketch he brought back upon returning from his expedition. Contrasted with Church's earlier painting of the north, ''[[The Icebergs]]'' (1861), the intact ship highlights Hayes' achievement in navigating this space, as well as the state of the nation in navigating the contentious historical moment. Presenting the ship's safe passage through the dark Arctic environment, Church suggested optimism for the future; a tiny light shines out from the ship's window.&lt;ref name="Kinsey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinsey|first=Joni L.|title=History in Natural Sequence: The Civil War Polyptych of Frederic Edwin Church|year=1995|work=Redefining American History Painting, Patricia M.

Charles Millard describes Church's paintings as "large in scale and size, sharply horizontal in format" and "dramatic in subject, but yielding in execution, and tend[ing] to exploit both value contrast and continuous tonal transition." Church's works, including ''Aurora Borealis,'' were completed using small touches of pigment built together through thin applications, leaving the viewer unaware of fracture between strokes. These works are also built around the tones of "ochre, brown, gray going to blue or green, and green" at the expense of the full value of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Millard|first=Charles|title=American Style and Quality |journal=[[The Hudson Review]] |date=Spring 1978 |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=163–169 |jstor=3850161 |doi=10.2307/3850161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception and legacy ==
[[File:Frederic Edwin Church - Rainy Season in the Tropics - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Rainy Season in the Tropics'', 1866.]]

Created at the end of the [[American Civil War]], ''Aurora Borealis'' (1865) was believed to depict the portent of a simultaneously triumphant and desolate [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victory, its meaning amplified in relation to later works, including ''The After Glow'' (1867) and other works.&lt;ref name="Avery"&gt;{{cite book |last=Avery |first=Kevin J. |title=Treasures from Olana: Landscapes|year=2005|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-4430-6|pages=48–49, 71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9fTXgbL63XQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q=aurora&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Aurora Borealis'' (1865) was associated with ''Rainy Season in the Tropics'' (1866) for two reasons. First, the two paintings marked the completion of the arctic-tropical sequence created with ''[[The Heart of the Andes]]'' (1859) and ''The North'', also known as ''[[The Icebergs]]'' (1861). These pairings drew together popular attention on exploration of the arctic North and the tropical South. The second association between ''Aurora Borealis'' and ''Rainy Season in the Tropics'' was established through their compositions and "in their luminosity", where each suggested a "renewed optimism in natural and historic events".&lt;ref name="Kinsey"/&gt;

'''''Blood in the Face''''' is a 1991 [[documentary film]] about [[white supremacy]] groups in North America. It was directed by Anne Bohlen, [[Kevin Rafferty]] and [[James Ridgeway]]. It features many interviews with various white supremacist leaders, and archival footage of others.

==Production details==
''Blood in the Face'' was inspired by a nonfiction book by author James Ridgeway, who is also credited as one of the film's directors. This documentary was largely shot in [[Cohoctah Township, Michigan]]. It focuses on a gathering of [[neo-Nazi]]s, [[racist]]s, and [[conspiracy theorist]]s who expect [[people of color]] to ignite a [[Racial Holy War]] in the U.S.

Filmmakers Anne Bohlen and Kevin Rafferty take an intentionally leisurely, conversational tack with supremacists who have assembled for lectures and workshops on everything from getting their message out via home videos to moving all like-minded "[[Christian Identity|white Christians]]" to the Northwest, especially the [[Idaho Panhandle]].

According to the audio commentary on the [[Roger &amp; Me]] DVD, [[Academy Award]]-winning American filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] appears as an off-screen interviewer because he was originally contacted to arrange a meeting between the filmmakers and the supremacists since he had previously interviewed them for a magazine.  At the last minute, the filmmakers backed out of the interview and Moore stepped in to conduct it.  Moore is thanked in the end credits.

Michael Moore does appear on camera during one interview, and can be heard during another interview.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3276">The ''Chitrakathi'' is the name of an occupational caste whose traditional livelihood was to narrate stories aided with pictures sojourning various places.  
== History ==

The term ''Chitrakathi'' is the conjunction of two words: ''chitra'' meaning picture and ''katha'' meaning story. With this application, a Chitrakathi is the one who narrates stories with a visual aid. Thereby one can imagine the primitiveness of this art. In tribal's life there is a long-standing tradition of chitrakathi's paintings. Wall paintings of Saora, Gaund, Pradhan are extremely popular in India and abroad.  It’s an almost extinct art form practised by the Thakkar tribal community of Maharashtra. Chitrakathi artists are a community of migrating story tellers found all over Maharashra and some parts of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. They made a series of single sheets of paintings. All paintings belonging to one story were kept in a bundle called pothi. The Theme of Chitrakathi paintings include stories on local versions of Ramayana and [[Mahabharata]] and mythical themes. Use of brownish tones of stone colors gives a remarkable effect. Figures in paintings were generally stylized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gottesbild.com/blog/?p=1315|title=Chitrakathi Paintings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

"Chitra" means picture and "katha" means story and the exponent called Chitrakathi is the person who narrates the story with the aid of some visual support. "Broadly speaking,Chitrakatha is identified in three forms, Leather shadow puppets, Stringed wooden puppets and Picture stories. The latter only, now, is identified as 'Chitrakathi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Reviving-a-dying-art-form-with-visuals-of-another/articleshow/16361065.cms|title=Reviving a dying art form with visuals of another.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists use the term "Pothi" to set of pictures which contains 30 to 50 pages arranged in chronological order. These pages are unbound like pages of Ramayana and Mahabharata previously one artist used to keep 40 to 50 Pothis but today fortunately 15 to 20 Pothis are in good condition. Some pothis date back to 300 years whereas some 50 to 60 years old. The art of story telling may become extinct in less than a decade and half unless effective steps are taken by the government to preserve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konkanonline.com/art/chitrakathi.html|title=Chitrakathi.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artists and awards ==

Some prominent Chitrakathi artists are Jayashree Patankar, Alaka Bhandiwad, Indira Seshadri, Meenakshi Madan, Rajasri Manikandan, V Shanmughapriya, Shoba Rajagopalan, S Suresh and Vaishnavi Srikanth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Reviving-a-dying-art-form-with-visuals-of-another/articleshow/16361065.cms|title=Reviving a dying art form with visuals of another.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/01/02/stories/2003010200840300.htm|title=Impressions of myth and nature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Devil codex Gigas.jpg|thumbnail|right|The ''[[Codex Gigas]]'', 13th century, Bohemia.]]
A '''codex''' ({{IPAc-en|'|k|oʊ|d|ɛ|k|s}}) (from the [[Latin]] ''caudex'' for "trunk of a tree" or ''block of wood'', ''[[book]]''), plural ''codices'' ({{IPAc-en|'|k|ɒ|d|ɪ|s|iː|z}}), is a book constructed of a number of sheets of [[paper]], [[vellum]], [[papyrus]], or similar materials.  The term is now usually only used of [[manuscript]] books, with hand-written contents,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed: Codex: "a manuscript volume"&lt;/ref&gt; but describes the format that is now near-universal for printed books in the Western world.  The book is usually bound by stacking the pages and fixing one edge to a [[bookbinding]], which may just be thicker paper ([[paperback]] or [[softback]]), or with stiff boards, called a [[hardback]], or in elaborate historical examples a [[treasure binding]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

At least in the Western world, the main alternative to the paged codex format for a long document is the continuous [[scroll]], which was the dominant book form in the [[Classical antiquity|ancient world]].  Some codices are continuously folded like a [[concertina]], in particular the [[Maya codices|Maya]] and [[Aztec codices]], which are actually long sheets of paper or animal skin folded into pages.  These do not really meet most current definitions of the "codex" form, but are so called by convention.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] developed the form from wooden [[Wax tablet|writing tablets]]. The gradual replacement of the scroll by the codex has been called the most important advance in book making before the invention of [[Printing press|printing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The codex transformed the shape of the book itself, and offered a form that lasted until present day (and continues to be used alongside [[e-paper]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M., (2011). ''Books: A Living History'', London: Thames &amp; Hudson, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of the codex is often associated with the rise of [[Christianity]], which adopted the format for use with the [[Bible]] early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=38−67}}&lt;/ref&gt; First described by the [[1st-century]] CE Roman poet [[Martial]], who praised its convenient use, the codex achieved numerical parity with the scroll around 300 CE,&lt;ref name=Oxf&gt;"Codex" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York &amp; Oxford, 1991, p. 473. {{ISBN|0195046528}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had completely replaced it throughout what was by then a Christianized [[Greco-Roman world]] by the [[6th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:The War Scroll - Dead Sea Scroll.jpg|thumb|Codices largely replaced scrolls similar to this.]]
The codex provides considerable advantages over other book formats:
* Compactness
* Sturdiness
* Economic use of materials by using both sides ([[recto and verso]])
* Ease of reference (a codex accommodates [[random access]], as opposed to a scroll, which uses [[sequential access]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=45−53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change from rolls to codices roughly coincides with the transition from [[papyrus]] to [[parchment]] as the preferred writing material, but the two developments are unconnected. In fact, any combination of codices and scrolls with papyrus and parchment is technically feasible and common in the historical record.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The codex began to replace the [[scroll]] almost as soon as it was invented. In [[Egypt]], by the fifth century, the codex outnumbered the scroll by ten to one based on surviving examples. By the sixth century, the scroll had almost vanished as a medium for literature.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Colin H., and Skeat, T.C. (1987), ''The Birth of the Codex''. London: [[Oxford University Press]] for the [[British Academy]], p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically, even modern [[paperback]]s are codices, but publishers and scholars reserve the term for [[manuscript]] (hand-written) books produced from [[Late antiquity]] until the [[Middle Ages]]. The scholarly study of these manuscripts from the point of view of the [[bookbinding]] craft is called [[codicology]]. The study of ancient documents in general is called [[paleography]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==History==
[[File:Wachstafel rem.jpg|thumb|Reproduced Roman-style [[wax tablet]], from which the codex evolved.]]
The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used precursors made of reusable [[Wax tablet|wax-covered tablets of wood]] for taking notes and other informal writings. Two ancient [[polyptych]]s, a ''pentatych'' and ''octotych'', excavated at [[Herculaneum]] used a unique connecting system that presages later sewing on of thongs or cords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carratelli|first=Giovanni Pugliese|title= "L'instrvmentvm Scriptorivm Nei Monumenti Pompeiani Ed Ercolanesi." in Pompeiana. Raccolta di studi per il secondo centenario degli di Pompei.|year=1950|pages=166–78.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]] may have been the first Roman to reduce scrolls to bound pages in the form of a note-book, possibly even as a papyrus codex.&lt;ref&gt;During the [[Gallic Wars]]; Suet. ''Jul.'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#56.6 56.6]; cf. {{Citation|last=Roberts|first= Colin H.|last2=Skeat|first2=Theodore Cressy|author2-link=Theodore Cressy Skeat|title=The Birth of the Codex|place=Oxford|publisher = Oxford University Press|year=1983|page=18 sq.|isbn=0-19-726061-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 1st century AD, a kind of folded parchment notebook called ''pugillares membranei'' in Latin became commonly used for writing in the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Colin H|last2=Skeat|first2=TC|title=The Birth of the Codex|year=1983|publisher=British Academy|location= London|isbn=0-19-726061-6|pages=15–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodore Cressy Skeat]] theorized that this form of notebook was invented in Rome and then spread rapidly to the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skeat|first= T.C.|title=The Collected Biblical Writings of T.C. Skeat.|year=2004|publisher=E.J. Brill |location= Leiden|isbn=90-04-13920-6|page=45|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=td_OLXo4RvkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Collected+Biblical+Writings+of+T.C.+Skeat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20at%20least%20three%20cases&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Codices are described in certain works by the [[Classical Latin]] poet, [[Martial]]. He wrote a series of five [[couplet]]s meant to accompany gifts of literature that Romans exchanged during the festival of [[Saturnalia]]. Three of these books are specifically described by Martial as being in the form of a codex; the poet praises the compendiousness of the form (as opposed to the scroll), as well the convenience with which such a book can be read on a journey. In another poem by Martial, the poet advertises a new edition of his works, specifically noting that it is printed as a codex, taking less space than a scroll and more comfortable to hold in one hand. According to [[Theodore Cressy Skeat]], this might be the first recorded known case of an entire edition of a literary work (not just a single copy) being published in codex form, though it was likely an isolated case and was not a common practice until a much later time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skeat|first= T.C.|title=The Collected Biblical Writings of T.C. Skeat.|year=2004|publisher=E.J. Brill |location= Leiden|isbn=90-04-13920-6|pages=45–46|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=td_OLXo4RvkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Collected+Biblical+Writings+of+T.C.+Skeat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20at%20least%20three%20cases&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his discussion of one of the earliest parchment codices to survive from [[Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt, Eric Turner seems to challenge Skeat's notion when stating, “…its mere existence is evidence that this book form had a prehistory”, and that “early experiments with this book form may well have taken place outside of Egypt.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Eric|title=The Typology of the Early Codex|year=1977|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-7696-1 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early codices of parchment or papyrus appear to have been widely used as personal notebooks, for instance in recording copies of letters sent (Cicero ''Fam.'' 9.26.1). The [[parchment]] notebook pages were commonly washed or scraped for re-use (called a [[palimpsest]]) and consequently, writings in a codex were often considered informal and impermanent.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

As early as the early 2nd century, there is evidence that a codex—usually of [[papyrus]]—was the preferred format among [[Christianity|Christians]]. In the library of the [[Villa of the Papyri]], [[Herculaneum]] (buried in AD 79), all the texts (of Greek literature) are scrolls (see [[Herculaneum papyri]]). However, in the [[Nag Hammadi library]], hidden about AD 390, all texts (Gnostic Christian) are codices. Despite this comparison, a fragment of a non-Christian parchment codex of [[Demosthenes]]' ''De Falsa Legatione'' from [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri|Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt demonstrates that the surviving evidence is insufficient to conclude whether Christians played a major or central role in the development of early codices—or if they simply adopted the format to distinguish themselves from [[Jews]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The earliest surviving fragments from codices come from Egypt, and are variously dated (always tentatively) towards the end of the 1st century or in the first half of the 2nd. This group includes the [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], containing part of St John's Gospel, and perhaps dating from between 125 and 160.&lt;ref&gt;Turner ''The Typology of the Early Codex'', U Penn 1977, and Roberts &amp; Skeat ''The Birth of the Codex'' (Oxford University 1983). From Robert A Kraft (see link): "A fragment of a Latin parchment codex of an otherwise unknown historical text dating to about 100 CE was also found at Oxyrhynchus ([[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 30|P. Oxy. 30]]; see Roberts &amp; Skeat 28). Papyrus fragments of a "Treatise of the Empirical School" dated by its editor to the centuries 1–2 CE is also attested in the Berlin collection (inv. # 9015, Pack\2 # 2355)—Turner, Typology # 389, and Roberts &amp; Skeat 71, call it a "medical manual"".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ezra Codex Amiantinus.jpg|thumb|Early medieval bookcase containing about ten codices depicted in the [[Codex Amiatinus]] ({{circa}} 700).]]
In [[Western culture#Foundations|Western culture]], the codex gradually replaced the scroll. Between the 4th century, when the codex gained wide acceptance, and the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the [[8th century]], many works that were not converted from scroll to codex were lost. The codex improved on the scroll in several ways. It could be opened flat at any page for easier reading, pages could be written on both front and back ([[recto and verso]]), and the protection of durable covers made it more compact and easier to transport.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

The ancients stored codices with spines facing inward, and not always vertically. The spine could be used for the [[incipit]], before the concept of a proper title developed in medieval times. Though most early codices were made of [[papyrus]], papyrus was fragile and supplies from Egypt, the only place where papyrus grew and was made into paper, became scanty. The more durable [[parchment]] and [[vellum]] gained favor, despite the cost.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

[[File:Codex Mendoza folio 37r.jpg|Folio 37 recto|thumb|right|[[Aztec codices|Aztec codex]] of the early 16th c., [[Codex Mendoza]], showing tribute obligations of particular indigenous towns.]]
The codices of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]] (Mexico and Central America) had the same form as the European codex, but were instead made with long folded strips of either fig bark ([[amatl]]) or plant fibers, often with a layer of [[whitewash]] applied before writing. [[New World]] codices were written as late as the 16th century (see [[Maya codices]] and [[Aztec codices]]). Those written before the Spanish conquests seem all to have been single long sheets folded [[concertina]]-style, sometimes written on both sides of the local ''[[amatl]]'' paper. There are significant codices produced in the colonial era, with pictorial and alphabetic texts in Spanish or an indigenous language such as [[Nahuatl]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}

In [[East Asia]], the scroll remained standard for far longer than in the [[Mediterranean]] world. There were intermediate stages, such as scrolls folded [[concertina]]-style and pasted together at the back and books that were printed only on one side of the paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://idp.bl.uk/education/bookbinding/bookbinding.a4d [[International Dunhuang Project]]—Several intermediate Chinese bookbinding forms from the 10th century].&lt;/ref&gt; This replaced traditional Chinese writing mediums such as [[bamboo and wooden slips]], as well as [[History of silk|silk]] and paper scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|page=227|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of the codex in [[History of China|China]] began with folded-leaf [[pamphlet]]s in the [[9th century]], during the late [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907), improved by the 'butterfly' bindings of the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279), the wrapped back binding of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271-1368), the stitched binding of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] (1368-1644) and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (1644-1912), and finally the adoption of Western-style bookbinding in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"&gt;{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|pages=227–229|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial phase of this evolution, the accordion-folded palm-leaf-style book, most likely came from [[India]] and was introduced to China via [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist missionaries and scriptures]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt;

[[Judaism]] still retains the [[Torah]] scroll, at least for ceremonial use.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==From scrolls to codex==
[[File:Codex Aureus Sankt Emmeram.jpg|thumb|The cover of the [[Carolingian]] gospel book ''Codex Aureus of Sankt Emmeram'', produced ca. 870 AD at the [[Palace of Aachen]], during the reign of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles the Bald]].]]
Among the experiments of earlier centuries, scrolls were sometimes unrolled horizontally, as a succession of columns. (The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] are a famous example of this format.) This made it possible to fold the scroll as an accordion. The next step was then to cut the [[Folio (printing)|folios]], sew and glue them at their centers, making it easier to use the [[papyrus]] or [[vellum]] [[Recto and verso|recto-verso]] as with a modern book. Traditional bookbinders would call one of these assembled, trimmed and bound folios a ''codex'' to differentiate it from the ''case,'' which we now know as ''hard cover''. Binding the codex was clearly a different procedure from binding the case.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Preparing a codex==
{{see|Parchment}}
The first stage in creating a codex is to prepare the animal skin. The skin is washed with water and lime, but not together, and it has to soak in the lime for a couple of days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/making/ |title=The Making of a Medieval Book |publisher=The J. Paul Getty Trust |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hair is removed and the skin is dried by attaching it to a frame called a herse.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;Clemens, Raymond, and Timothy Graham. Introduction to Manuscript Studies. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The parchment maker attaches the skin at points around the circumference. The skin attaches to the herse by cords. To prevent tearing, the maker wraps the area of the skin attached to the cord around a pebble called a pippin.&lt;ref name="Intro" /&gt; After completing that, the maker uses a crescent shaped knife called a ''lunarium'' or ''lunellum'' to remove any remaining hairs. Once the skin completely dries, the maker gives it a deep clean and processes it into sheets. The number of sheets from a piece of skin depends on the size of the skin and the final product dimensions. For example, the average calfskin can provide three and half medium sheets of writing material. This can be doubled when folded into two conjoint leaves, also known as a ''bifolium''. Historians have found evidence of manuscripts where the scribe wrote down the medieval instructions now followed by modern membrane makers.&lt;ref name="daniel"&gt;Thompson, Daniel. "Medieval Parchment-Making." The Library 16, no. 4 (1935).&lt;/ref&gt; Defects can often be found in the membrane, whether from the original animal, human error during the preparation period, or from when the animal was killed. Defects can also appear during the writing process. Unless it is kept in perfect condition, defects can also appear later in the life of a manuscript.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

===Preparation of the pages for writing===
[[File:Codex Manesse 193r - Albrecht von Rapperswil.jpg|thumb|Manuscript, [[Codex Manesse]]. Most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baselines on which the text was entered.]]
First the membrane must be prepared. The first step is to set up the quires. The quire is a group of several sheets put together. Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham point out, in "Introduction to Manuscript Studies", that "the quire was the scribe’s basic writing unit throughout the Middle Ages":&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"Pricking is the process of making holes in a sheet of parchment (or membrane) in preparation of it ruling. The lines were then made by ruling between the prick marks...The process of entering ruled lines on the page to serve as a guide for entering text. Most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baselines on which the text was entered and with vertical bounding lines that marked the boundaries of the columns."&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Forming the quire===
From the Carolingian period and all the way up to the Middle Ages, different styles of folding the quire came about. For example, in mainland Europe throughout the Middle Ages, the quire was put into a system in which each side folded on to the same style. The hair side met the hair side and the flesh side to the flesh side. This was not the same style used in the British Isles, where the membrane was folded so that it turned out an eight-leaf quire, with single leaves in the third and sixth positions.&lt;ref name="Intro" /&gt; The next stage was tacking the quire. Tacking is when the scribe would hold together the leaves in quire with thread. Once threaded together, the scribe would then sew a line of parchment up the "spine" of the manuscript, as to protect the tacking.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

=== Racist chair controversy ===
In 2014, a photograph of Zhukova sitting on a chair designed as a mannequin of a black woman was featured on {{em|Buro 24/7}}, an online fashion publication. The photograph was widely criticized as racist. {{em|Buro 24/7}} cropped the chair from the photo and Zhukova apologised, describing the chair as artwork and as "commentary on gender and racial politics". Zhukova added, "I utterly abhor racism and would like to apologise to those offended by my participation in this shoot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chan|first1=Stephanie|title=Russian Fashion Editor Sits on a Black Person Posing as a Chair; Apologizes|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dasha-zhukova-sits-a-black-673059|accessdate=15 November 2014|issue=21 January 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216141032/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dasha-zhukova-sits-a-black-673059|archivedate=16 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Julee|title=Garage Magazine Editor-In-Chief Dasha Zhukova Sits On A 'Black Woman' Chair In Shocking Editorial|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/20/dasha-zhukova-black-woman-chair-buro-247-editorial_n_4633544.html|accessdate=15 November 2014|work=Huffington Post|date=20 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113222523/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/20/dasha-zhukova-black-woman-chair-buro-247-editorial_n_4633544.html|archivedate=13 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saul|first1=Heather|title=Editor apologises after Dasha Zhukova 'black woman mannequin' chair sparks racism row|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/dasha-zhukova-black-woman-mannequin-chair-sparks-racism-row-9074915.html|accessdate=17 November 2014|work=The Independent|date=21 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129213716/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/dasha-zhukova-black-woman-mannequin-chair-sparks-racism-row-9074915.html|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:DeadParrot.png|right|thumb|300px|Mr Praline ([[John Cleese]]) (right) attempts to return his dead Norwegian Blue parrot to the shopkeeper ([[Michael Palin]])]]

The "'''Dead Parrot Sketch'''", alternatively and originally known as the "'''Pet Shop Sketch'''" or "'''Parrot Sketch'''", is a [[Sketch comedy|sketch]] from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''. It was written by [[John Cleese]] and [[Graham Chapman]] and initially performed in the show's first series, in the eighth episode ("Full Frontal Nudity", which first aired 7 December 1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus: All the Words, Volume One | first1 = Graham | last1 = Chapman | first2 = John | last2 = Cleese | first3 = Terry | last3 = Gilliam | first4 = Eric | last4 = Idle | first5 = Terry | last5 = Jones | first6 = Michael | last6 = Palin | editor-first = Roger | editor-last = Wilmut | year = 1989 | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-679-72647-0 | page = 320 (Appendix)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The sketch portrays a conflict between disgruntled customer [[Mr Praline]] (played by Cleese) and a shopkeeper ([[Michael Palin]]), who argue whether or not a recently purchased "Norwegian Blue" [[parrot]] is dead. It pokes fun at the many [[euphemism]]s for death used in [[British culture]].

The "Dead Parrot" sketch was inspired by a "Car Salesman" sketch that Palin and Chapman had done in ''[[How to Irritate People]]''. In it, Palin played a [[car salesman]] who repeatedly refused to admit that there was anything wrong with his customer's (Chapman) car, even as it fell apart in front of him. That sketch was based on an actual incident between Palin and a car salesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The First 28&lt;s&gt;0&lt;/s&gt; Years of Monty Python |last=Johnson |first=Kim "Howard" |year=1999 |location=New York |publisher=Thomas Dunne Books |isbn=0-312-16933-7|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Monty Python Live at Aspen]]'', Palin said that this salesman "had an excuse for everything". John Cleese said on the same show that he and Chapman "believed that there was something very funny there, if we could find the right context for it". In early drafts of what would become the Dead Parrot Sketch, the frustrated customer was trying to return a faulty [[toaster]] to a shop. Chapman realised that it needed to be "madder", and came up with the parrot idea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/jman8132/grahmchapman jman8132 at sites.google]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Cleese and Palin have done many versions of the "Dead Parrot" sketch for various television shows, record albums, and live performances. "Dead Parrot" was voted the top [[alternative comedy]] sketch in a [[Radio Times]] poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4052641.stm |title=Python Dead Parrot is top sketch |accessdate=31 March 2007 |date=29 November 2004 |publisher=BBC  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{listen|filename=Parrot sketch.ogg|title=The Dead Parrot sketch performed on ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' in 1969|description=Listen to a clip from the sketch.}}

==Plot==
[[File:Dead Parrot O2 Arena.jpg|thumb|Dead Parrot sketch at [[Monty Python Live (Mostly)]] in 2014]]
Mr. Praline (Cleese) enters the pet shop to register a complaint about the dead Norwegian Blue parrot (parrots are not endemic to [[Norway]]) just as the shopkeeper (Palin) is preparing to close the establishment for lunch. Despite being told that the bird is deceased and that it had been nailed to its perch, the proprietor insists that it is "pining for the [[fjord]]s" or simply "stunned".&lt;ref name=AllTheWords-p104&gt;''All the Words: Volume One''. pp. 104-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the exasperated Praline attempts to wake up the parrot, the shopkeeper tries to make the bird move by hitting the cage, and Praline erupts into a rage after banging "Polly Parrot" on the counter. After listing several euphemisms for death ("is no more", "has ceased to be", "bereft of life, it rests in peace", and "this is an ex-parrot") he is told to go to the pet shop run by the shopkeeper's brother in [[Bolton]] for a refund. That proves difficult, however, as the proprietor of that store (who is really the shopkeeper, save for a fake moustache) claims this is [[Ipswich]], whereas the railway station attendant ([[Terry Jones]]) claims he is actually in Bolton after all.&lt;ref name=AllTheWords-p104/&gt;

Confronting the shopkeeper's "brother" for lying, the shopkeeper claims he was playing a prank on Praline by sending him to Ipswich, which was a [[palindrome]] for Bolton; Praline points out that the shopkeeper was wrong because a palindrome for Bolton would have been "Notlob". 

Just as Praline has decided that "this is getting too silly", Graham Chapman's no-nonsense [[The Colonel (Monty Python)|Colonel]] bursts in and orders the sketch stopped.&lt;ref name=AllTheWords-p104/&gt;

==Variations of the sketch==

In the 1971 film ''[[And Now For Something Completely Different]]'', the sketch ends with the shopkeeper explaining that he always wanted to be a [[lumberjack]] and, ignoring Mr Praline's protests of that being irrelevant, begins singing "[[The Lumberjack Song]]".

The ''[[Monty Python Live at Drury Lane]]'' album features a live version of the sketch, which is slightly different from the TV version. Praline's rant about the deceased parrot includes "He fucking snuffed it!"  Also, the sketch ends with the shopkeeper saying that he has a slug that does talk. Cleese, after a brief pause, says, "Right, I'll have that one, then!" According to Michael Palin's published diary, Palin changed his response in order to throw Cleese off. During this performance something occurs on stage that does not translate into audio, but causes the audience to break into hysterics upon Cleese's follow-up line "Now that's what I call a dead parrot".

The 1976 [[Monty Python Live at City Center]] performance ended with the slug lines, followed by:
:''Shopkeeper'': (long, long pause) ... Do you want to come back to my place?
:''Mr Praline'': I thought you'd never ask.

On the [[Rhino Records]]' compilation ''Dead Parrot Society'', a live performance from ''[[The Secret Policeman's Ball]]'' in 1976 has Palin cracking up while Cleese declares "Pining for the fjords? What kind of talk is that?" The audience cheers this bit of [[breaking character]], but Palin quickly composes himself and Cleese declares "Now, look! This is nothing to laugh at!" before proceeding with the sketch. This version is included in the book and CD set ''The Best British Stand-Up and Comedy Routines'', along with a transcript of the sketch and the [[Four Yorkshiremen sketch]].

In his appearance on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', Cleese appears as a pirate attempting to take over a spaceship during a "Pigs In Space" sketch. At the end of the sketch, he demands of the smart-mouthed talking parrot on his shoulder, "Do you want to be an ex-parrot?"

In 1989's ''[[The Secret Policeman's Biggest Ball]]'', a benefit for [[Amnesty International]], the sketch opens similarly, but ends very differently:
:''Mr Praline'': It's dead, that's what's wrong with it.
:''Shopkeeper'': So it is. 'Ere's your money back and a couple of holiday [[voucher]]s.
:''(audience goes wild)''
:''Mr Praline'': ''(looks completely flabbergasted)'' Well, you can't say [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] hasn't changed some things.

In a 1997 ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' performance of the sketch, Cleese added a line to the rant: "Its metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians!" In an interview on NPR's ''[[Fresh Air]]'', Palin attributed an almost dead audience to his seeing guests reverently mouthing the words of the sketch, rather than laughing at it. To end the sketch, Palin asked Cleese, "Do you want to come back to my place?" to which Cleese said, "I thought you'd never ask!"

In his published diary, [[Michael Palin]] recalls that during the filming of ''Monty Python's [[Life of Brian]]'' in [[Tunisia]], [[Spike Milligan]] (who happened to be there on holiday) regaled the Pythons with his own version of the Dead Parrot sketch, but changed "Norwegian Blue" to "Arctic Grey".

In a 2002 interview with [[Michael Parkinson]], John Cleese said that when he and Palin were performing the sketch on [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]], Palin made him laugh by saying, when asked if his slug could talk, "It mutters a bit" instead of "Not really." When Cleese eventually stopped laughing, he couldn't remember where they were in the sketch. He turned to the audience and asked them what the next line was, and people shouted it at him, causing him to wonder, "What is the point of this?" He also says that when he and Palin were asked to do the sketch for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' they sat down together to try to remember the lines, and when they got stuck they considered just going out and stopping somebody on the street to ask how it went, since everybody seemed to have it memorised.

[[Margaret Thatcher]] famously used the sketch in a speech at the [[Conservative Party Conference]] in 1990, referring to the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and their symbol being a dove, before ending the speech by commenting, "[[And Now for Something Completely Different|And now for something completely different]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ6TgaPJcR0 |title=Margaret Thatcher does the Dead Parrot Sketch |publisher=YouTube |date=5 February 2010 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' ran the front-page headline "This party is no more...it has ceased to be...this is an EX-party" for an article about a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] conference.

[[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] made a ''[[South Park]]'' version of the sketch depicting [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] angrily returning a dead [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] to [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s shop. Most of the lines are the same in the original sketch. It ends when [[Terry Gilliam]]'s animations play around with Cartman and everything is crushed by the giant foot.

Cleese and Palin acted out the sketch during the Python's reunion in [[The O2]] in July 2014, [[Monty Python Live (Mostly)]]. The sketch ended with the shopkeeper saying he has a selection of cheeses, transitioning into the [[Cheese Shop Sketch]]. The entire sketch ended like the City Centre performance, with the shopkeeper offering Mr Praline to come back to his place, and Mr Praline replying "I thought you'd never ask."
In their final performance on 20 July (which was broadcast live to many theatres all over the world), whilst listing the metaphors for the parrot's death, Cleese added the line "it had expired and gone to meet Dr. [[Graham Chapman|Chapman]]" after which both Cleese and Palin did a thumbs-up to the sky.

In the episode of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' from 13 November 2015, John Cleese is a guest on the show. At the end of the big furry hat segment (where Colbert and in this specific instance Cleese, create nonsensical rules), Cleese says, "Do you want to come back to my place?" and Stephen answers, "I thought you'd never ask."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwH04FeeVlQ&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further uses==
At [[Graham Chapman]]'s memorial service, John Cleese began his [[eulogy]] by reprising euphemisms from the sketch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHk9WC7fnQ | title=Graham Chapman's funeral | medium=Video | date=1989 | people=John Cleese, Eric Idle | location=London, England, United Kingdom | publisher=YouTube | accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 there was a follow up with their ''Live at Aspen'', with the supposed ashes of Chapman. Midway through the interview, [[Terry Gilliam]] put his feet up on the table and knocked the urn off, spilling the ashes and prompting a frantic, [[slapstick]] attempt to clean him up with a dustpan and brush, and subsequently a [[dustbuster]]. 

In an anniversary concert [[Jasper Carrott]] had allowed his fans to pick the material. He opened the performance by announcing this then saying "I've had some funny requests; somebody from Newark wanted me to do the dead parrot sketch". {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Part or all of the dead parrot sketch is quoted in several television programmes, among them the "Life of Python" sketch from ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' (a parody of the ''[[Friday Night, Saturday Morning]]'' debate on ''[[Life of Brian]]'') and "The Early Bird", an episode from the [[List of Death in Paradise episodes#Series 3 (2014)|third season]] of ''[[Death in Paradise (TV series)|Death in Paradise]]''.

==Precedents==
A joke dated {{circa}} AD 400, recently translated from Greek, shows similarities to the Parrot sketch. It was written by Hierocles and Philagrius and was included in a compilation of 265 jokes titled ''[[Philogelos]]: The Laugh Addict''. In the Greek version, a man complains to a slave-merchant that his new slave has died. The slave-merchant replies, "When he was with me, he never did any such thing!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3454319/Dead-Parrot-sketch-is-1600-years-old.html | title = Dead parrot sketch is 1600 years old: It's long been held that the old jokes are the best jokes - and Monty Python's Dead Parrot sketch is no different | first = Stephen | last = Adams | work = The Telegraph | date = 13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mark Twain]]'s humorous short story "A Nevada Funeral", two characters use a series of [[euphemism]]s for death including '[[Kick the bucket|kicked the bucket]]' and 'departed to that mysterious country from whose bourne no traveller returns'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Mark | last = Twain | author-link = Mark Twain | title = A Nevada Funeral  | work = North Otago Times | volume = XVIII | issue = 825 | page = 4 | date = 18 April 1873 | url = http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=NOT18730418.2.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, [[Tony Hancock]] and [[Sid James]] performed a similar sketch involving a dead tortoise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/arcarti/hancock-tortoise-1959 |title= Hancock tortoise 1959 |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, [[Benny Hill]] performed a sketch entitled "The Taxidermist" (written by [[Dave Freeman (British writer)|Dave Freeman]]) on ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'' in which he attempted to pass off a stuffed duck as a parrot (blaming its different appearance on "the steaming" and "the shrinkage"). [[John Cleese]] later admitted that he watched Hill's show during this period, but didn't recall this particular piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewisohn|first1=Mark|title=Funny Peculiar: The True Story of Benny Hill|date=2002|publisher=Sidgwick &amp; Jackson|location=London|isbn=0-330-39340-5|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s [[Freddie Davies|Freddie "Parrot Face" Davies]] included an obviously stuffed caged parrot as part of his stage routine, occasionally complaining that he had been swindled by the seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pm7zk |title= Blackpool: Big Night Out |publisher=BBC |date=6 January 2013 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dedalo Minosse International Prize for commissioning a building''' is promoted by ALA-Assoarchitetti, Italian association for professional [[Architects]].&lt;br /&gt;
This prize, was created in 1997 to emphasize the client's role as a fundamental partner of both the architect and the builder in generating high-quality work.

The name '''Dedalo Minosse''' derives from [[Daedalus]] and [[Minos]].&lt;br /&gt;
[[Daedalus]] is considered the first architect of [[greek mythology]], while [[Minos]] was the first client.

The Prize is awarded biennially by a jury that includes internationally renowned architects, writers, art historians, journalists, industry executives, and planning officials.&lt;br /&gt;
Additional prizes are awarded by ALA-Assoarchitetti and by Dedalo-Minosse patrons.

The presentation ceremony takes place in [[Teatro Olimpico]] in [[Vicenza]], northern [[Italy]], the city of architect [[Andrea Palladio]].

Eligibility is open to architects, engineers and clients from around the world, with separate recognition for established architects and those under 40 years of age.

The opposite is a [[prologue]]&amp;mdash;a piece of writing at the ''beginning'' of a work of literature or drama, usually used to open the story and capture interest.&lt;ref name="ProDevice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://literarydevices.net/epilogue/ | title=Literary Devices: Definition and Examples of Literary Terms: Prologue|date=2014| publisher=Literary Devices | work=Literary Devices Website | accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some genres, for example [[television programs]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[video games]], call the epilog an "outro" patterned on the use of "intro" for "introduction".

==In literature==
[[Image:Grandville, Autre Monde, Epilog.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Illustration from ''Un Autre Monde'' epilogue, by [[Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville|Grandville]].]]

An epilogue is the final [[chapter (books)|chapter]] at the end of a [[narrative|story]] that often serves to reveal the fates of the [[Character (arts)|character]]s. Some epilogues may feature [[Scene (drama)|scenes]] only tangentially related to the subject of the story. They can be used to hint at a sequel or wrap up all the loose ends. They can occur at a significant period of time after the main [[plot (narrative)|plot]] has ended. In some cases, the epilogue is used to allow the main character a chance to "speak freely".

An epilogue can continue in the same narrative style and perspective as the preceding story, although the form of an epilogue can occasionally be drastically different from the overall story. It can also be used as a [[sequel]].

==In film==
In [[film]]s, the final scenes may feature a montage of images or clips with a short explanation of what happens to the characters. A few examples of such films are ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'', ''[[American Graffiti]]'', ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2]]'', ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', ''[[Remember the Titans]]'', and ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]''.

There are many films which do not only include a few glimpses of the character's future, but also are based on an epilogue. Most epilogues in films are shown in a dramatic fashion, usually in silence, to commemorate an important happening, for example, the fate of a character in the film.

The epilogue of ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]'' shows a happy ending, an alternative to the actual ending. 

In many [[documentaries]] and [[biopics]], the epilogue is text-based, explaining what happened to the subjects after the events covered in the film.

==In video gaming==
In [[Video game|video gaming]], epilogues can occur at the end of the story, usually after the [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]] have rolled. An epilogue in a game functions similarly to an epilogue in [[film]] and [[literature]], providing closure to the end of a story.

However, the way in which an epilogue is interacted with in a video game can then determine how a story ends, in works of fiction that contain [[Types of fiction with multiple endings#Video games|multiple endings]]. For example, there are four possible endings to ''[[Spec Ops: The Line]]'', and three of the endings are chosen by what the player does in the epilogue.

In games that feature the [[Permadeath|permanent death]] of [[Player character|playable characters]], an epilogue can chronicle what has happened to the various characters that have survived the events of the game, depicting how their situation has changed after the story has come to a conclusion. For example, the 2015 video game ''[[Until Dawn]]'' features those who survived recounting their experiences to the Police after being rescued. This system can also be expanded on. In most games of the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series, relationships can be built between characters, allowing for unique outcomes to happen for characters depending on the actions of the player throughout the campaign.

A [[visual novel]] can also feature a type of epilogue, which will wrap up all of the scenarios encountered by a player, most often after the game has been fully completed by reaching all of the multiple endings; as is the case with ''[[Tsukihime]]'', featuring an epilogue that expands on the endings of all completable routes, as well as providing context for the rest of the game by explaining events in the prologue.

==In television==
For many years ''[[The Epilogue]]'', a reflective 5-minute [[sermonette]], was the last programme of the day broadcast on a Sunday evening by [[BBC]] radio and later television. The format was picked up by the independent broadcaster [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1956 and was adopted across its various franchises until 1988.

'''''Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, on Horseback''''' ({{lang-es|Gaspar de Guzmán, conde-duque de Olivares, a caballo}}) is an oil on canvas painting by Spanish painter [[Diego Velázquez]], made around the year 1636.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/gaspar-de-guzman-count-duke-of-olivares-on/ca958021-65b0-421a-aaf0-55994df10575 |title=Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, on Horseback |publisher=[[Museo Nacional del Prado]] |accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been in the [[Museo del Prado]] in Madrid since its inauguration in 1819.

The object of the work was to validate the power of [[Gaspar de Guzman]], Count of Olivares and Duke of Sanlúcar la Mayor, known as the Count-Duke of Olivares, the chief minister under [[Philip IV of Spain]], a Spanish nobleman and influential politician. In the style of Velázquez, this painting is an exception, as its design and color are more vigorous and pompous than his usual more somber portraits.

== Description ==
Olivares is portrayed on horseback, an honor usually reserved for monarchs and reflects the power he attained as ''[[favourite|valido]]'' or right hand of the king (equivalent to the current [[Prime Minister of Spain|prime minister]]'s office). The picture resembles equestrian portraits Velázquez had painted for the Hall of Realms of the [[Buen Retiro Palace]] but was not made for this series, but rather as displaying a particular custom of Olivares bound for home. It is not dated but stands at just after this series, around 1638, and was possibly painted after the [[Siege of Fuenterrabía (1638)|battle of Fuenterrabía]], a military success that was attributed to Olivares although he was not personally involved. The picture did not join the royal collection at the predecessor of the Prado Museum until a century later.

The Count-Duke looks at the viewer, making sure all can witness his feat. The figure is viewed from a low viewpoint and his torso is turned back, making it look more slender; Olivares had a massive body and was rather clumsy, as seen in the portraits that Velazquez had done before. The horse raises its front legs, performing a somersault or [[levade]] as it looks toward the battlefield. Drawing a diagonal from the hills that can be seen in the landscape, the composition provides energy to the portraiture; in this dynamism, the work reminds of [[Rubens]]. This equestrian portrait differs from those made for the royal family and is believed to have been suggested by Olivares; Velazquez had to take particular care, as Olivares was the highest political office of the court (after the king) and had supported him in his early days as a painter in Madrid.

The Count-Duke wears a wide-brimmed feathered hat and the band of the State; the hand holds a marshal's baton, which marks the direction of the battle. The armor he wears is possibly preserved in the [[Palace of Liria]] of Madrid (collection of the [[House of Alba]]).

The rich chromaticism and treatment of light give the scene a great vitality.

The battle in the distance is treated with small spots. The landscape is very schematic, as defined Velázquez, with no buildings or characters. Perhaps it is because the painter did not know the town of [[Hondarribia]], where the battle happened as described, although other sources believe the painting did not refer to any particular battle. The hills fade in green and blue tones, providing a feeling of remoteness, for it is said to have a very sharp aerial perspective.

The '''Herefordshire School''' is the name of a hypothetical group of master masons working in [[Herefordshire]] and [[Worcestershire]] (in England) during the 12th century. The name was coined by Polish-English scholar [[George Zarnecki]]. Their distinctive [[Romanesque sculpture|Romanesque]] sandstone and limestone carvings are to be found in several parish churches in the area, most notably [[Kilpeck]], but also [[Eardisley]], [[Shobdon]] and Castle Frome in Herefordshire, and [[Rock, Worcestershire]]. Their work draws on a variety of cultural sources for its religious and mystical images; Norman military figures, [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon animals]] and [[Celtic art|Celtic abstract patterns]] combine to create a unique and beautiful synthesis. Despite its overtly religious nature, Herefordshire School work also has a playful, occasionally bawdy approach.

'''''Higher Learning''''' is a 1995 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[John Singleton]] and starring an [[ensemble cast]]. The film follows the changing lives of three incoming freshmen at the fictional Columbus University: Malik Williams ([[Omar Epps]]), a black track star who struggles with academics; Kristen Connor ([[Kristy Swanson]]), a shy and naive girl; and Remy ([[Michael Rapaport]]), a lonely and confused man seemingly out of place in his new environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Violence Erupts in Opening Week of 'Higher Learning' |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 20, 1995 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-20/entertainment/ca-22364_1_higher-learning |accessdate=2012-06-03 |first=Richard |last=Natale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film also featured [[Tyra Banks]]' first performance in a theatrical film. [[Laurence Fishburne]] won an [[NAACP Image Award]] for "Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture"; [[Ice Cube]] was also nominated for the award. This was the last film appearance of [[Dedrick D. Gobert]], who was shot dead in 1994 prior to the film's release.

The exterior shots and outdoor scenes were shot on the campus of [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) while the interiors were shot at [[Sony Pictures Studios]].

==Plot==&lt;!--- Jan 2016: still a little long, at 831 words (vs 2131 words in Dec 2015), but then there are 3 converging storylines  ---&gt;  
At fictitious Columbus University, students Malik Williams, a black track athlete, Kristen Connor, a white woman, and Remy, a white young man, are starting their freshman year.

Kristen's roommate is Monet, a black student. Malik's roommate is Wayne, a white student. Both sets of roommates generally get along.  Monet and Malik attend a [[Dormitory|dorm]] party hosted by Fudge, an [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and militant senior. Remy, Fudge's roommate, is upset at the loud [[Hip hop music|rap music]] being played so late. He flags down an all-white campus security patrol to break up the party. Fudge is upset that lead Officer Bradley comes down hard on the black students, but allows the room down the hall to continue their loud "[[hillbilly]]" music. Kristen, while walking home, meets Taryn, a junior as well as an openly [[lesbian]] student. Taryn warns her about walking alone late at night and invites her to a student group.

Malik and Kristen's introductory [[political science]] class is taught by Professor Maurice Phipps, a conservative black man from the [[West Indies]]. Professor Phipps challenges the class to determine who they are for themselves and not let others categorize them.

Fudge and his friend Dreads play loud music, disrupting Remy's studying. When Remy complains, Fudge mocks and threatens him, causing Remy to move in with a new roommate, Jewish student David. Later, Remy loses at a video game to Malik, who further mocks him.

Frat boy Billy rapes a drunken Kristen. Monet finds Kristen crying on her bed, then fields a racially charged call from Billy. Angered, Monet turns to Fudge, who recruits his friends to confront him at a frat party. Kristen points out Billy to the black students, who pull him outside and force him to apologize to Monet (not knowing that he raped Kristen).

Kristen joins Taryn's student group on harmony between different races and cliques. With time, she eventually opens up to Taryn about her rape, with Taryn encouraging her to report it and attempting to console her. As days pass, Kristen slowly realizes her growing attraction to Taryn.

Remy has become more isolated.  He is invited for a drink by Scott Moss, a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] and [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[skinhead]], along with Scott's skinhead friends: Erik, James, and the weight-lifting, hulking Knocko.

Malik confronts Phipps about a paper, arguing for a better grade. When Phipps shows him the various spelling and grammar errors, Malik calls him a sellout for the "white establishment". Phipps angrily responds that the world owes Malik nothing and he must work for his own good to make a difference in the world. When Malik's teammates confront him for a poor performance at a track meet, he responds with Fudge's militant Afrocentric ideology. He walks away and flirts with fellow runner Deja. With time they become a couple, and Deja helps Malik with his essay and spelling errors.

Remy spends more time with Scott and his gang. Scott preaches his racist beliefs, and the troubled Remy is slowly being convinced that "the white man is endangered", agreeing to shave his head and join Scott's group.

After attending a rape awareness rally with Taryn, Kristen asks to spend the night. Taryn rebuffs her, wanting Kristen to be sure. Kristen eventually starts separate relationships with Wayne and Taryn, who are unaware that Kristen is sleeping with both of them.

Remy confronts Malik with racial slurs. Remy later pulls a handgun on Malik and David, hurling racial slurs at them both as he packs his belongings and drops out of the university. Again, Officer Bradley and the all-white campus security assume Malik is at fault, letting Remy escape. Malik decides to move in with Fudge and his like-minded black friends, while Remy moves in with Scott and the neo-Nazi skinheads.  After Malik and his black friends win a fistfight against Remy and his skinhead friends, Scott first tells Remy he should not drop out of school because they do not just need soldiers, but also educated people like lawyers to fight for their cause. However Remy, feeling punked by Malik, just wants to turn to violence. So after Remy insists that he is "for real", Scott sighs and shows Remy the sniper rifle. He challenges Remy to kill for the [[White people|white race]].

Kristen organizes a peace festival with Monet to calm down the students. Malik and Deja attend, and are caught in the frenzy when Remy opens fire from the rooftop of a nearby building. Two students are killed, including Deja, who dies in Malik's arms. Malik runs into the building and attacks Remy, trying to choke him to death when Officer Bradley and his campus guards intervene and beat Malik while letting Remy go. The campus guards finally approach Remy, who looks and apologizes to Malik for everything that he did and commits suicide.

A few days later, Malik and Phipps discuss his future at the university, with Phipps saying he trusts Malik's judgment. Later, Malik and Kristen are seen talking, for the first time, at an impromptu memorial site. Kristen feels guilty about the deaths because she started the Peace Fest, but Malik assuages her guilt.

As Phipps leaves his office, the final shot shows the United States flag fluttering in the wind as the caption "unlearn" appears over it, fading to the closing credits.

===Critical response {{anchor|Film Reviews|Critics}} ===
The film received mixed reviews. [[Roger Ebert]] commended John Singleton's direction of the film: "He sees with a clear eye and a strong will, and is not persuaded by fashionable ideologies. His movies are thought-provoking because he uses familiar kinds of characters and then asks hard questions about them." He awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=January 11, 1995 |authorlink=Roger Ebert |first=Roger |last=Ebert |title=Higher Learning |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950111/REVIEWS/501110301/1023 |via=RogerEbert.com |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time Out (company)|TimeOut Magazine]]'' wrote: "a stylish, intelligent film-maker, Singleton interweaves the threads of his demographic tapestry with assurance, passion and a welcome awareness of the complexities of the college community's contradictory impulses towards integration and separatism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/72021/higher_learning.html |title=Higher Learning Review |magazine=[[Time Out (company)|TimeOut Magazine]] |date=&lt;!--undated--&gt; |accessdate=2015-01-27 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;

''Reel Film Reviews'' wrote that the film is "consistently entertaining and well-acted all around. While it's not a perfect movie – Cube's character disappears for a 30-minute stretch and Singleton's approach often veers into heavy-handedness – it is nevertheless an intriguing look at the differences between races and how such differences can clash" and awarded it 3.5 stars out of 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''Hurry Sundown''''' is a 1967 American [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] produced and directed by [[Otto Preminger]], and starring [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Michael Caine]].&lt;ref name="Hurry Sundown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/4647/Hurry-Sundown/|title=Hurry Sundown|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplay by [[Horton Foote]] and Thomas C. Ryan is based on the 1965 novel of the same title by [[Katya Alpert Gilden|K.B. Gilden]], a [[pseudonym]] for the married couple Katya and Bert Gilden. It marked [[Faye Dunaway]]'s film debut.

==Plot==
In 1946, bigoted, draft-dodging Henry Warren and his wife Julie Ann, owners of a Northern canning plant, are determined to purchase a large tract of uncultivated farmland in rural [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Two plots remain beyond their grasp, one owned by Henry's cousin Rad McDowell and his wife Lou, the other by black farmer Reeve Scott, whose mother Rose had been Julie's mammy. Neither man is interested in selling his land, and they form a partnership to strengthen their claim to it, which infuriates Henry.

When Rose suddenly dies, Henry tries to persuade his wife to charge Reeve with illegal ownership of his property, but local teacher Vivian Thurlow searches the town's records and uncovers proof that Reeve legally registered the deed to his land. Julie, upset with Henry's treatment of their mentally challenged son, decides to leave him and drops her suit against Reeve.

With the help of [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen, Henry dynamites the [[levee]] above the farms, and Rad's oldest child drowns in the ensuing flood, much to Henry's dismay. Rather than admit defeat, Rad and Reeve decide to rebuild their decimated property with the assistance of their neighbors.

==Production==
Otto Preminger was shown the [[galley proof]] of the 1,046-page Gilden manuscript by his brother [[Ingo Preminger|Ingo]] and, fully expecting it to be another ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', purchased the film rights to the novel for $100,000 eight months prior to its publication. He initially intended to adapt it for a four-and-a-half-hour [[epic film]] that would be shown twice-a-day at what would be the highest price scale in the history of American film exhibition, with a top admission of $25 on Friday and Saturday nights. When the book sold a mere 300,000 copies, Preminger decided a less grandiose project might be in order.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, pp. 410–411&lt;/ref&gt;

Because he admired his screenplay for the [[Harper Lee]] novel ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', Preminger hired [[Horton Foote]] to adapt the Gilden book, which the author thought was "embarrassing," with "no genuine Southern flavor at all." His first instinct was to decline the offer, but he then decided he could do something with it, so Preminger installed him and his family in a house in [[London]], where the director was filming ''[[Bunny Lake Is Missing]]''. Foote completed his draft in three months, but Preminger was unhappy with it, feeling it was missing the melodrama and theatricality the story required. He paid Foote his full fee and dismissed him, although he later insisted on giving the writer screen credit, which Foote accepted. (In later years he admitted he never saw the film and never included it on his résumé.) Preminger replaced Foote with Thomas C. Ryan, who worked for him as his chief [[Publisher's reader|reader]] and was familiar with the type of material his employer found appealing.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, pp. 411–412&lt;/ref&gt;

Preminger wanted to shoot the entire film in Georgia, and in November and December 1965 he visited the state to scout locations, but a union dispute changed his plans. Because he would be filming during the oppressively hot and humid months of June through August, he planned to shoot at night as much as possible. The New York union, which had jurisdiction over Georgia, demanded crews be paid double for any filming after 4:00pm, an added expense Preminger knew would be prohibitive. [[Production designer]] [[Gene Callahan (production designer)|Gene Callahan]] suggested his home state of [[Louisiana]] might be a viable alternative, since the unions there were governed by the more liberal one in Chicago. [[Baton Rouge]] and its environs were selected, and Callahan's crew began planting cornfields, erecting shanties, and constructing a dam and [[reservoir]] containing 17.5 million gallons of water.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, p. 414&lt;/ref&gt;

From the start, Preminger and his cast and crew encountered strong resistance from the locals, who resented having a film featuring a biracial friendship made in their midst. Tires were slashed, some actors received telephoned death threats, and a burning cross appeared on one of the sets at 3am. The manager of the hotel where everyone was housed, the Bellemont Motor Hotel, advised Preminger [[mixed bathing]] would not be permitted in the swimming pools, but grudgingly agreed to designate one "interracial" when the director threatened to vacate the premises and not pay the bill. At one point a "crude bomb" was thrown into the desegregated pool, but no one was injured as it happened late at night.&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, Faye, and Sharkey, Betsey, ''Looking for Gatsby''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster 1998. {{ISBN|0-671-67526-5}}, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually armed state troopers were called in to guard the hotel wing where everyone was staying, making them feel as if they were under [[house arrest]]. Problems were encountered even in [[New Orleans]], when Michael Caine and Bobby Hooks were refused admission to [[Brennan's]] restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;Cain, Michael, ''What's It All About? The Autobiography.'' Random House, Australia, 1992. {{ISBN|0 09 182648 9}}, p 233&lt;/ref&gt;  Matters came to a head when a convoy of cars and trucks returning to the hotel through a heavily wooded area one evening became the target of a volley of [[sniper]] gunfire. [[Robert Hooks]] later recalled, "All of us were convinced that we were surrounded by some of the dumbest and meanest people on the face of the earth, to say nothing of being the most cowardly." &lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, pp. 414–417&lt;/ref&gt;

Midway through filming, Preminger had to replace cinematographer Loyal Griggs with [[Milton R. Krasner]] when Griggs seriously injured his back. He later banned screenwriter Ryan from the set for talking to [[Rex Reed]] for an article published in ''[[The New York Times]]''. In it Reed characterized the director as an autocrat who was losing his grip, quoted [[Michael Caine]] as saying, "He's only happy when everybody else is miserable," and claimed Griggs had been fired by Preminger "in a moment of uncontrolled fury." Griggs demanded and received a retraction from the ''Times''.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, pp. 423–424&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preminger, Otto, ''Preminger: An Autobiography''. New York: Doubleday 1977. {{ISBN|0-385-03480-6}}, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Preminger greatly regretted casting [[Faye Dunaway]], with whom he clashed on a regular basis. She felt the director didn't know "anything at all about the process of acting." She resented having him yell at her in public and commented, "Once I've been crossed, I'm not very conciliatory." After filming was completed, she sued Preminger to win her release from the five-film contract she had signed with him. An out-of-court settlement was reached in March 1968. Dunaway later admitted, "It cost me a lot of money to not work for Otto again . . . I regretted paying him [but] I thought he was awful."&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, Faye, and Sharkey, Betsey, ''Looking for Gatsby''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster 1998. {{ISBN|0-671-67526-5}}, pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, pp. 420–422&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The movie opened to unfavorable reviews from those who felt that Preminger was out of tune with the problems of the contemporary South. It was also criticized for its out-of-date racial stereotyping and tasteless attitude toward sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Fifty Worst Films of All Time|The Fifty Worst Films of All Time (and how they got that way)]]'' by Harry Medved, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Ebert of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' called the film "a frustrating case, not good but not particularly bad, with a smokescreen of controversy surrounding it and obscuring its real faults. The trouble with this film . . . is not that it's racist and tasteless, but that it's naive and dull."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19670529/REVIEWS/705290301/1023 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosley Crowther of ''The New York Times'' described the film as "pure [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]]" and "an offense to intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' observed "Obviously, ''Hurry Sundown'' was intended as a paean to racial justice, but Producer-Director Otto Preminger chooses strange ways to display his big brotherhood. One sequence shows Negro sharecroppers singing a white-eyed hallelujah number reminiscent of those '40s films that pretended to liberalize but patently patronized. Two hours of such cinematic clichés make the viewer intolerant of everyone in the film, regardless of race, creed or color."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941114,00.html ''Time'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Variety'' wrote that "Otto Preminger has created an outstanding, tasteful but hard-hitting, and handsomely-produced film . . . Told with a depth and frankness, the story develops its theme in a welcome, straight-forward way that is neither propaganda nor mere exploitation material."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117791843.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 ''Variety'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time Out London'' wrote that "The Preminger flair which made ''[[The Cardinal]]'' so enjoyable, despite its hackneyed script, seems to have deserted him in this lumbering melodrama, put together with the sort of crudely opportunistic style which alternates scenes of the rich folks parading in a stately mansion with shots of the poor sitting down to their humble fare while thumping mood music makes sure you get the point."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/72426/Hurry_Sundown.html ''Time Out London'' review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601164821/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/72426/Hurry_Sundown.html |date=2010-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Channel 4 noted "Preminger wears a liberal heart on his sleeve and then blows his nose on it as heavy-handed sentimentality and nobility dominate this story . . . God, sex, class, guilt, moralizing and Negro spirituals are all thrown into the stew, and you'll come away feeling that although it's worthy in its ideals, it could have done with a touch less overblown melodrama."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=104424&amp;section=review ''Channel 4 review]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Legion of Decency]] gave the film a "C", "Condemned" rating, citing the portrayal of Blacks and portrayal of sex.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Fifty Worst Films of All Time|The Fifty Worst Films of All Time (and how they got that way)]]'' by Harry Medved, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and nominations==
Faye Dunaway won the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles]] for her performances in this and ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=1967 BAFTA archives]&lt;/ref&gt; She was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress]] but lost to [[Katharine Ross]] in ''[[The Graduate]]''.

[[File:Index Librorum Prohibitorum 1.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' (Venice 1564)]]
The '''''Index librorum prohibitorum''''' ({{lang-en|List of Prohibited Books}}) was a list of publications deemed [[heresy|heretical]], or contrary to [[morality]] by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Sacred Congregation of the Index]] (a former [[Dicastery]] of the [[Roman Curia]]) and thus [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] were [[Book censorship|forbidden]] to read them.&lt;ref name="PFGrendler"/&gt;  

There were scattered attempts to censor individual books before the sixteenth century, notably the ninth-century ''Decretum Glasianum'', but none of these were either official or widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lenard |first1=Max |title=On the origin, development and demise of the ''Index librorum prohibitorum'' |journal=Journal of Access Services |date=2006 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=51–63 |doi=10.1300/J204v03n04_05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much later, a first version (the ''Pauline Index'') was promulgated by [[Pope Paul IV]] in 1559, which Paul F. Grendler believed marked "the turning-point for the freedom of enquiry in the Catholic world", and which lasted less than a year, being then replaced by what was called the ''Tridentine Index'' (because it was authorized at the [[Council of Trent]]), which relaxed aspects of the ''Pauline Index'' that had been criticized and had prevented its acceptance.&lt;ref name="PFGrendler"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jJnyxg3xxTEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Cambridge+History+of+Renaissance+Philosophy,+Charles+B.+Schmitt,&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FdZlU8HDFaXm7AbPkIHQBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Cambridge%20History%20of%20Renaissance%20Philosophy%2C%20Charles%20B.%20Schmitt%2C&amp;f=false Grendler, Paul F. "Printing and censorship" in ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy''], Charles B. Schmitt, ed. (Cambridge University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-52139748-3}}) pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th and final edition appeared in 1948, and the ''Index'' was formally abolished on 14 June 1966 by [[Pope Paul VI]].&lt;ref name=Hubert168&gt;''The Church in the Modern Age'', (Volume 10) by Hubert Jedin, John Dolan, Gabriel Adriányi 1981 {{ISBN|082450013X}}, page 168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kusukawa |first1=Sachiko |title=Galileo and Books |url=http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/starry/galbooks.html |website=Starry Messenger |language=EN |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the list was to protect the faith and morals of the faithful by preventing the reading of theologically, culturally, and politically disruptive books. Books thought to contain such errors included works by astronomers such as [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''[[Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae]]'', which was on the Index from 1621 to 1835, and by philosophers, like [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. The various editions of the ''Index'' also contained the rules of the Church relating to the reading, selling and pre-emptive censorship of books—editions and [[Bible translations|translations of the Bible]] that had not been approved by the Church could be banned.&lt;ref&gt;''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'', 1559, Regula Quarta ("Rule 4")&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Latin Church]] [[canon law (Roman Catholic Church)|canon law]] still recommends that works concerning sacred Scripture, theology, canon law, church history, and any writings which specially concern religion or morals, be submitted to the judgment of the local [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2P.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 827 §3]&lt;/ref&gt; The local ordinary consults someone whom he considers competent to give a judgment and, if that person gives the ''[[nihil obstat]]'' ("nothing forbids") the local ordinary grants the ''[[imprimatur]]'' ("let it be printed").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2P.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 830]&lt;/ref&gt; Members of [[religious institute]]s require the ''[[imprimi potest]]'' (it can be printed) of their major superior to publish books on matters of religion or morals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2P.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 832]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the scientific theories in works that were on early editions of the Index have long been routinely taught at Catholic universities worldwide; for example, the general prohibition of books advocating [[heliocentrism]] was only removed from the ''Index'' in 1758, but already in 1742 two Minims mathematicians had published an edition of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687) with commentaries and a preface stating that the work assumed heliocentrism and could not be explained without it.&lt;ref&gt;John L.Heilbron, ''Censorship of Astronomy in Italy after Galileo'' (in McMullin, Ernan ed., ''The Church and Galileo'', University of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame, 2005, p. 307, IN. {{ISBN|0-268-03483-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; The burning at the stake of [[Giordano Bruno]],&lt;ref&gt;Paula Findlen, [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080929/findlen "A Hungry Mind: Giordano Bruno, Philosopher and Heretic"], ''The Nation'', September 10, 2008.

==Background and history==
===European restrictions on the right to print===
[[File:Handtiegelpresse von 1811.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Printing press from 1811, [[Munich]], Germany.]]
The historical context in which the ''Index'' appeared involved the early restrictions on printing in Europe. The refinement of [[moveable type]] and the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] around 1440 changed the nature of book publishing, and the mechanism by which information could be disseminated to the public.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1962), The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man (1st ed.), University of Toronto Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-6041-9}} page 124&lt;/ref&gt;  Books, once rare and kept carefully in a small number of libraries, could be mass-produced and widely disseminated.

In the 16th century, both the churches and governments in most European countries attempted to regulate and control printing because it allowed for rapid and widespread circulation of ideas and information. The [[Protestant Reformation]] generated large quantities of polemical new writing by and within both the Catholic and Protestant camps, and religious subject-matter was typically the area most subject to control.  While governments and church encouraged printing in many ways, which allowed the dissemination of [[Bible]]s and government information, works of dissent and criticism could also circulate rapidly. As a consequence, governments established controls over printers across Europe, requiring them to have official licenses to trade and produce books.&lt;ref name="MacQueen 2007 34"&gt;{{Cite book |last=MacQueen |first=Hector L. |last2=Waelde |first2=Charlotte |last3=Laurie |first3=Graeme T. |title=Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |page=34 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC&amp;dq=contemporary+intellectual+property&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-0-19-926339-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 14"&gt;{{Cite book |last=de Sola Pool |first=Ithiel |title=Technologies of freedom |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1983 |page=14 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=BzLXGUxV4CkC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=36#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-674-87233-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early versions of the ''Index'' began to appear from 1529 to 1571. In the same time frame, in 1557 the [[English Crown]] aimed to stem the flow of dissent by chartering the [[Stationers' Company]]. The right to print was restricted to two universities and to the 21 existing printers in the [[city of London]], which had between them 53 [[printing presses]].

The French crown also tightly controlled printing, and the printer and writer [[Etienne Dolet]] was burned at the stake for atheism in 1546. The 1551 [[Edict of Châteaubriant]] comprehensively summarized censorship positions to date, and included provisions for unpacking and inspecting all books brought into France.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rabelais encyclopedia'' by Elizabeth A. Chesney 2004 {{ISBN|0-313-31034-3}} pages 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The printing press as an agent of change'' by Elizabeth L. Eisenstein 1980 {{ISBN|0-521-29955-1}} page 328&lt;/ref&gt; The 1557 [[Edict of Compiègne]] applied the death penalty to heretics and resulted in the burning of a noblewoman at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jean Knecht, ''The Rise and Fall of Renaissance France: 1483–1610'' 2001, {{ISBN|0-631-22729-6}} page 241&lt;/ref&gt; Printers were viewed as radical and rebellious, with 800 authors, printers and book dealers being incarcerated in the [[Bastille]] before it was stormed in 1789.&lt;ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 15"&gt;{{Cite book |last=de Sola Pool |first=Ithiel |title=Technologies of freedom |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1983 |page=15 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=BzLXGUxV4CkC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=36#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-674-87233-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, the prohibitions of church and state followed each other, e.g. [[René Descartes]] was placed on the Index in the 1660s and the French government prohibited the teaching of [[Cartesianism]] in schools in the 1670s.&lt;ref&gt;''A companion to Descartes'' by Janet Broughton, John Peter Carriero 2007 {{ISBN|1-4051-2154-8}} page&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Statute of Anne|Copyright Act 1710]] in Britain, and later copyright laws in France, eased this situation. However, historian Eckhard Höffner claims that copyright laws and their restrictions acted as a barrier to progress in those countries for over a century, since British publishers could print valuable knowledge in limited quantities for the sake of profit; while the German economy prospered in the same time frame since there were no restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,710976,00.html Der Spiegel August 18 2010 article: No Copyright Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Geschichte und Wesen des Urheberrechts'' (History and nature of copyright) by Eckhard Höffner, July 2010 (in German) {{ISBN|3-930893-16-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early indexes (1529–1571)===
[[File:Index 1557.jpg|thumb|160px|Title page of the first Papal Index, ''Index Auctorum et Librorum'', published in 1557 and then withdrawn.]]
The first list of the kind was not published in [[Rome]], but in Catholic [[Habsburg Netherlands|Netherlands]] (1529); [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] (1543) and [[Paris]] (1551) under the terms of the [[Edict of Châteaubriant]] followed this example. By mid-century, in the tense atmosphere of wars of religion in Germany and France, both Protestant and Catholic authorities reasoned that only control of the press, including a catalog of prohibited works, coordinated by ecclesiastic and governmental authorities could prevent the spread of heresy.&lt;ref name="Schmitt 1991:45"&gt;Schmitt 1991:45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Roman ''Index'' was printed in 1557 under the direction of [[Pope Paul IV]] (1555–1559), but then withdrawn for unclear reasons.&lt;ref name="Forbes 70"/&gt; In 1559, a new index was finally published, banning the entire works of some 550 authors in addition to the individual proscribed titles:&lt;ref name="Forbes 70"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=drKSeeGU_1oC&amp;pg=PA70 ''Studies in the History of Venice'' by Brown Horatio Robert Forbes p.70]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;They included everything by [[Pietro Aretino]], [[Machiavelli]], [[Erasmus]] and [[Rabelais]] (Schmitt 1991:45).&lt;/ref&gt; "The Pauline Index felt that the religious convictions of an author contaminated all his writing."&lt;ref name="Schmitt 1991:45"/&gt; The work of the censors was considered too severe and met with much opposition even in Catholic intellectual circles; after the [[Council of Trent]] had authorised a revised list prepared under [[Pope Pius IV]], the so-called ''Tridentine Index'' was promulgated in 1564; it remained the basis of all later lists until [[Pope Leo XIII]], in 1897, published his ''Index Leonianus''.

The [[blacklisting]] of some Protestant scholars even when writing on subjects a modern reader would consider outside the realm of [[dogma]] meant that, unless they obtained a [[dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]], obedient Catholic thinkers were denied access to works including: botanist [[Conrad Gesner]]'s ''[[Historiae animalium (Gesner)|Historiae animalium]]''; the botanical works of [[Otto Brunfels]]; those of the medical scholar [[Janus Cornarius]]; to [[Christoph Hegendorff]] or [[Johann Oldendorp]] on the theory of law; Protestant geographers and cosmographers like [[Jacob Ziegler]] or [[Sebastian Münster]]; as well as anything by Protestant theologians like [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]] or [[Philipp Melanchthon]].&lt;ref&gt;These authors are instanced by Schmitt 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the inclusions was the [[Libri Carolini]], a theological work from the 9th century court of [[Charlemagne]], which was published in 1549 by Bishop Jean du Tillet and which had already been on two other lists of prohibited books before being inserted into the Tridentine Index.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7rjenNXferEC&amp;pg=PA90 Paul Oskar Kristeller (editor), ''Itinerarium Italicum''] (Brill 1975 {{ISBN|978-90-0404259-9}}), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred Congregation of the Index (1571–1917)===
In 1571, a special [[congregation (Roman Curia)|congregation]] was created, the '''Sacred Congregation of the Index''', which had the specific task to investigate those writings that were denounced in [[Rome]] as being not exempt of errors, to update the list of Pope Pius IV regularly and also to make lists of required corrections in case a writing was not to be condemned absolutely but only in need of correction; it was then listed with a mitigating clause (e.g., ''donec corrigatur'' (forbidden until corrected) or ''donec expurgetur'' (forbidden until purged)).{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Several times a year, the congregation held meetings. During the meetings, they reviewed various works and documented those discussions. In between the meetings was when the works to be discussed were thoroughly examined, and each work was scrutinized by two people. At the meetings, they collectively decided whether or not the works should be included in the Index. Ultimately, the pope was the one who had to approve of works being added or removed from the Index. It was the documentation from the meetings of the congregation that aided the pope in making his decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heneghan |first1=Thomas |title=Secrets Behind The Forbidden Books |journal=America |date=2005 |volume=192 |issue=4 |url=http://americamagazine.org/issue/517/article/secrets-behindthe-forbidden-books |accessdate=27 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726125102/http://americamagazine.org/issue/517/article/secrets-behindthe-forbidden-books |archivedate=26 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galileo before the Holy Office.jpg|thumb|left|[[Galileo]] being condemned in 1633.]]
This sometimes resulted in very long lists of corrections, published in the ''Index Expurgatorius'', which was cited by [[Thomas James]] in 1627 as "an invaluable reference work to be used by the curators of the [[Bodleian library]] when listing those works particularly worthy of collecting".&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation |title=Encyclopedia on Censorship |first1=Jonathan |last1=Green |first2=Nicholas J. |last2=Karolides |page=257 |publisher=Facts on File, Inc |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bunHURgi7FcC&amp;pg=PA257}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Prohibitions made by other congregations (mostly the Holy Office) were simply passed on to the Congregation of the Index, where the final [[decree]]s were drafted and made public, after approval of the [[Pope]] (who always had the possibility to condemn an author personally—there are only a few examples of such condemnation, including those of [[Lamennais]] and [[George Hermes|Hermes]]).{{cn|date=June 2017}}

An update to the Index was made by Pope [[Leo XIII]], in the 1897 apostolic constitution [[Officiorum ac Munerum]], known as the "Index Leonianus".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03519d.htm Catholic encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent editions of the Index were more sophisticated; they graded authors according to their supposed degree of toxicity, and they marked specific passages for expurgation rather than condemning entire books.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. (2011). Books: A Living History. Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications. {{ISBN|978-1-60606-083-4}}, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition]] of the Roman Catholic Church later became the [[Holy Office]], and since 1965 has been called the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]]. The Congregation of the Index was merged with the Holy Office in 1917, by the Motu Proprio "Alloquentes Proxime" of Pope Benedict XV; the rules on the reading of books were again reelaborated in the new ''Codex Iuris Canonici''. From 1917 onward, the Holy Office (again) took care of the Index.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

===Holy Office (1917–1966)===
While individual books continued to be forbidden, the last edition of the Index to be published appeared in 1948. This 20th&lt;ref name=EB&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285220/Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum Encyclopædia Britannica: ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'']&lt;/ref&gt; edition contained 4,000 titles censored for various reasons: [[heresy]], moral deficiency, [[Human sexuality|sexual]] explicitness, and so on. That some [[Atheism|atheist]]s, such as [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]], were not included was due to the general ([[Council of Trent|Tridentine]]) rule that [[Heresy|heretical]] works (''i.e.'', works that contradict Catholic dogma) are [[ipso facto]] forbidden. Some important works are absent simply because nobody bothered to denounce them.&lt;ref&gt;"The works appearing on the Index are only those that ecclesiastical authority was asked to act upon" ([http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285220/Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum Encyclopædia Britannica: Index Librorum Prohibitorum).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many actions of the congregations were of a definite [[political]] content.&lt;ref&gt;"The entanglement of Church and state power in many cases led to overtly political titles being placed on the Index, titles which had little to do with immorality or attacks on the Catholic faith.  For example, a history of Bohemia, the Rervm Bohemica Antiqvi Scriptores Aliqvot ... by Marqvardi Freheri (published in 1602), was placed on the Index not for attacking the Church, but rather because it advocated the independence of Bohemia from the (Catholic) Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Likewise, The Prince by Machiavelli was placed in the Index in 1559 after it was blamed for widespread political corruption in France (Curry, 1999, p.5)" ([http://www.unc.edu/~dusto/dusto_prague_paper.pdf David Dusto, ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum: The History, Philosophy, and Impact of the Index of Prohibited Books'').] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020043824/http://www.unc.edu/~dusto/dusto_prague_paper.pdf |date=2012-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the significant listed works of the period was the Nazi philosopher [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s ''[[Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'' for scorning and rejecting "all dogmas of the Catholic Church, indeed the very fundamentals of the Christian religion".&lt;ref name="Richard Bonney pp. 122"/&gt;

===Abolition (1966)===
On 7 December 1965, Pope Paul VI issued the Motu Proprio ''[[Integrae servandae]]'' that reorganized the Holy Office as the ''Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul VI, Pope|date=1965-12-07|title=Integrae servandae|website=vatican.va|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19651207_integrae-servandae.html|accessdate=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Index was not listed as being a part of the newly constituted congregation's competence, leading to questioning whether it still was. This question was put to Cardinal [[Alfredo Ottaviani]], pro-prefect of the congregation, who responded in the negative.&lt;ref&gt;''L'Osservatore della Domenica'', 24 April 1966, pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cardinal also indicated in his response that there was going to be a change in the Index soon.

A June 1966 Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith [[Notification (Holy See)|notification]] announced that, while the ''Index'' maintained its moral force, in that it taught Christians to beware, as required by the natural law itself, of those writings that could endanger faith and morality, it no longer had the force of [[ecclesiastical positive law]] with the associated penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|date=1966-06-14|title=Notification regarding the abolition of the Index of books|website=vatican.va|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19660614_de-indicis-libr-prohib_en.html|access-date=2016-07-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307041622/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19660614_de-indicis-libr-prohib_en.html|archivedate=2014-03-07|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and impact==
===Censorship and enforcement===
The ''Index'' was not simply a reactive work. Roman Catholic [[author]]s had the opportunity to defend their writings and could prepare a new edition with necessary corrections or deletions, either to avoid or to limit a [[Ban (law)|ban]]. Pre-publication censorship was encouraged.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

The ''Index'' was enforceable within the [[Papal States]], but elsewhere only if adopted by the civil powers, as happened in several Italian states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rl96-_JKQvkC&amp;pg=PA236 Stephen G. Burnett, ''Christian Hebraism in the Reformation Era''] (Brill 2012 {{ISBN|978-9-00422248-9}}), p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas adopted their own lists of forbidden books. In the [[Holy Roman Empire]] book censorship, which preceded publication of the ''Index'', came under control of the Jesuits at the end of the 16th century, but had little effect, since the German princes within the empire set up their own systems.&lt;ref name=Febvre/&gt; In France it was French officials who decided what books were banned&lt;ref name=Febvre&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9opxcMjv4TUC&amp;pg=PA245 Lucien Febvre, Henri Jean Martin, ''The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing 1450–1800''] (Verso 1976 {{ISBN|978-1-85984108-2}}), pp. 245–246&lt;/ref&gt; and the Church's ''Index'' was not recognized.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W7ZKc_okFDkC&amp;pg=PA11 John Michael Lewis, ''Galileo in France''] (Peter Lang 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-82045768-0}}), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Spain had its own ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'', which corresponded largely to the Church's,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jJnyxg3xxTEC&amp;pg=PA48 C. B. Schmitt, Quentin Skinner, Eckhard Kessler, ''Renaissance Philosophy']' (Cambridge University Press 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-52139748-3}}), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; but also included a list of books that were allowed once the forbidden part (sometimes a single sentence) was removed or "expurgated".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HKcrSTBD0W8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bernardo de Sandoval, Archbishop of Toledo ''Index Librorum et Expurgatorium'' (Louis Sanchez Typography,  Madrid 1612) Regla XII ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued moral obligation===
On 14 June 1966, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith responded to inquiries it had received regarding the continued moral obligation concerning books that had been listed in the Index. The response spoke of the books as examples of books dangerous to faith and morals, all of which, not just those once included in the Index, should be avoided regardless of the absence of any written law against them. The Index, it said, retains its moral force "inasmuch as" (''quatenus'') it teaches the conscience of Christians to beware, as required by the natural law itself, of writings that can endanger faith and morals, but it (the Index of Forbidden Books) no longer has the force of ecclesiastical law with the associated censures.&lt;ref&gt;"Haec S. Congregatio pro Doctrina Fidei, facto verbo cum Beatissimo Patre, nuntiat Indicem suum vigorem moralem servare, quatenus Christifidelium conscientiam docet, ut ab illis scriptis, ipso iure naturali exigente, caveant, quae fidem ac bonos mores in discrimen adducere possint; eundem tamen non amplius vim legis ecclesiasticae habere cum adiectis censuris" (''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 58 (1966), p. 445).  Cf. [http://cctld.it/storia/informazione/index/notificatio_14_6_66.pdf Italian text published, together with the Latin, on ''L'Osservatore Romano'' of 15 June 1966])&lt;/ref&gt;

The congregation thus placed on the conscience of the individual Christian the responsibility to avoid all writings dangerous to faith and morals, while at the same time abolishing the previously existing ecclesiastical law and the relative censures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=35670 ''Post litteras apostolicas'']&lt;/ref&gt; without thereby declaring that the books that had once been listed in the various editions of the Index of Prohibited Books had become free of error and danger.

In a letter of 31 January 1985 to Cardinal [[Giuseppe Siri]], regarding the book ''[[The Poem of the Man-God]]'', Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (then Prefect of the Congregation, who later became [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), referred to the 1966 notification of the Congregation as follows: "After the dissolution of the Index, when some people thought the printing and distribution of the work was permitted, people were reminded again in ''L'Osservatore Romano'' (15 June 1966) that, as was published in the ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' (1966), the Index retains its moral force despite its dissolution. A decision against distributing and recommending a work, which has not been condemned lightly, may be reversed, but only after profound changes that neutralize the harm which such a publication could bring forth among the ordinary faithful."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/poem_of_the_man.htm Poem of the Man-God]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing judgments===

In the course of centuries, editions of the Index Librorum Prohibitorum saw deletions as well as additions of content. Thus writings by [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati]] were placed on the Index in 1849 but were removed by 1855, and [[Pope John Paul II]] mentioned Rosmini's work as a significant example of "a process of philosophical enquiry which was enriched by engaging the data of faith".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_14091998_fides-et-ratio_en.html Encyclical ''Fides et ratio''], 74&lt;/ref&gt; The 1758 edition of the Index removed the general prohibition of works advocating [[heliocentrism]] as a fact rather than a hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;McMullin, Ernan, ed. The Church and Galileo. Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-268-03483-4}}. pp. 307, 347&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the ideas that were part of the charges of heresy (along with many other purely religious ones) against [[Giordano Bruno]], who in 1600 was burned alive at the stake in [[Campo de' Fiori]] in [[Rome]], now form some of the foundations of modern [[cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2008/08/25/080825crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=all New Yorker Magazine, August 25, 2008: ''The Forbidden World'']&lt;/ref&gt;

With the changing standards by which items are judged as immoral and with books being produced in some countries at a rate of one every few minutes, the maintenance of any kind of Index would have proven almost impossible, in any case.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Shattuck 1997 ''Forbidden Knowledge: From Prometheus to Pornography'' {{ISBN|0-15-600551-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/18/books/the-last-word-how-many-books-are-too-many.html?pagewanted=1 New York Times: ''How Many Books are Too Many?''

[[Charles Darwin]]'s works were never included.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Martinez, professor of the philosophy of science at the Santa Croce Pontifical University in Rome, in speech reported on [http://www.cinews.ie/article.php?artid=5793 Catholic Ireland net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607000752/http://www.cinews.ie/article.php?artid=5793 |date=2009-06-07 }} Accessed 26 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

In many cases, an author's ''opera omnia'' (his complete works) were forbidden. Most of these were inserted in the Index at a time when the Index itself stated that the prohibition of someone's ''opera omnia'' did not cover works whose contents did not concern religion and were not forbidden by the general rules of the Index, but this explanation was omitted in the 1929 edition, an omission that was officially interpreted in 1940 as meaning that thenceforth "''opera omnia''" covered all the author's works without exception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tie0hkcrpg4C&amp;pg=PA36 Jesús Martínez de Bujanda, ''Index librorum prohibitorum: 1600–1966''] (Droz 2002 {{ISBN|2-600-00818-7}}), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal Ottaviani stated in April 1966 there was too much contemporary literature and the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith could not keep up with it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[L'Osservatore della Domenica]], 24 April 1966, pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''intellectual property infringement''' is the infringement or violation of an [[intellectual property right]]. There are several types of intellectual property rights, such as [[copyright]]s, [[patent]]s, and [[trademark]]s. Therefore, an intellectual property infringement may for instance be one of the following:

* [[Copyright infringement]]
* [[Patent infringement]]
* [[Trademark infringement]]

Techniques to detect (or deter) intellectual property infringement include:
* [[Fictitious entry]], such as:
** Fictitious dictionary entry. An example is ''[[Esquivalience]]'' included in the New Oxford American Dictionary (NOAD)
** [[Trap street]], a fictitious street included on a map for the purpose of "trapping" potential copyright violators of the map
* [[Watermark (disambiguation)|Watermarking]]

[[Designing around]] a patent may in some cases constitute a way to avoid infringing it.

'''Jewish [[folklore]]''' are [[legend]]s, [[music]], [[oral history]], [[proverb]]s, [[joke]]s, [[popular belief]]s, [[fairy tales]], [[narrative|stories]], [[tall tales]], and [[Folkways (sociology)|customs]] that are the [[tradition]]s of Judaism. [[Folklore|Folktales]] are characterized by the presence of unusual personages, by the sudden transformation of men into beasts and vice versa, or by other unnatural incidents. A number of [[Aggadah|haggadic stories]] bear folktale characteristics, especially those relating to [[Og]], King of Bashan, which have the same exaggerations as have the ''lügenmärchen'' of modern German folktales.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dennis, "Og," ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Myth, Magic, and Mysticism''&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Middle Ages==
There is considerable evidence of Jewish people bringing and helping the spread of Eastern folktales in Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Joseph Jacobs, "Folk-Tales", ''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; Besides these tales from foreign sources, Jews either collected or composed others which were told throughout the European [[ghetto]]s, and were collected in Yiddish in the "Maasebücher".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Numbers of the folktales contained in these collections were also published separately.&lt;ref&gt;See the earlier ones given by Moritz Steinschneider in ''Hebrew Books in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (Catalogus Librorum Hebræorum in Bibliotheca Bodleiana)'', Berlin, 1852-60)'', Nos. 3869-3942&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, difficult to call many of them folktales in the sense given above, since nothing fairy-like or supernormal occurs in them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Legends==
[[File:Golem and Loew.jpg|thumb|''[[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Rabi Loew]] and [[Golem]]'' by [[Mikolas Ales]] (1899).]]

There are a few definitely Jewish legends of the Middle Ages which partake of the character of folktales, such as those of [[Jewish pope Andreas|the Jewish pope Andreas]] and of the [[golem]], or that relating to the wall of the Rashi chapel, which moved backward in order to save the life of a poor woman who was in danger of being crushed by a passing carriage in the narrow way. Several of these legends were collected by {{Interlanguage link multi|Abraham Moses Tendlau|de|3=Abraham Tendlau}} (''Sagen und Legenden der Jüdischen Vorzeit'').&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurt a.M.: Kauffman, 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century many folk-tales were gathered among Jews or published from Hebrew manuscripts by {{Interlanguage link multi|Israël Lévi|fr}} in the ''Revue des Etudes Juives'', in the ''Revue des Traditions Populaires'', and in ''Melusine''; by [[Moses Gaster]] in ''Folk-Lore'' and in the reports of [[Montefiore College]]; and by [[Max Grunwald]] in ''Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft für Jüdische Volkskunde'';&lt;ref&gt;see Index to part vi., s.v. "Erzählungen"&lt;/ref&gt; by [[L. Wiener]] in the same periodical; and by [[Friedrich Salomon Krauss|F. S. Krauss]] in ''Urquell'', both series.

==Aggadah and folklore compilations==
* ''[[Legends of the Jews|The Legends of the Jews]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/default.htm |title=The Legends of the Jews by Louis Ginzberg |publisher=Philologos.org |date=2001-04-13 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Rabbi [[Louis Ginzberg]], is an original synthesis of a vast amount of aggadah from the [[Mishnah]], the two Talmuds and [[Midrash]]. Ginzberg had an encyclopedic knowledge of all rabbinic literature, and his masterwork included a massive array of aggadot. However he did not create an anthology which showed these aggadot distinctly.  Rather, he paraphrased them and rewrote them into one continuous narrative that covered five volumes, followed by two volumes of footnotes that give specific sources.
*The ''[[Ein Yaakov]]'' is a compilation of the aggadic material in the Babylonian Talmud together with commentary.
*''Sefer Ha-Aggadah'', "The Book of Legends" is a classic compilation of aggadah from the Mishnah, the two Talmuds and the Midrash literature. It was edited by [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] and [[Yehoshua Hana Ravnitzky]]. Bialik and Ravnitzky worked to compile a comprehensive and representative overview of aggadah; they spent three years compiling their work. When they found the same aggadah in multiple versions, from multiple sources, they usually selected the later form, the one found in the Babylonian Talmud. However they also presented a great some aggadot sequentially, giving the early form from the Jerusalem Talmud, and later versions from the Babylonian Talmud, and from a classic midrash compilation. In each case each every aggadah is given with its original source. In their original edition, they translated the Aramaic aggadot into modern Hebrew. Sefer Ha-Aggadah was first published in 1908-11 in [[Odessa]], Russia, then reprinted numerous times in [[Israel]]. In 1992 it was translated into English as "The Book of Legends", by William G, Braude.
* ''Mimekor Yisrael'', by [[Micha Josef Berdyczewski|Micha Josef (bin Gorion) Berdyczewski]]. Berdyczewski was interested in compiling the folklore and legends of the Jewish people, from the earliest times up until the dawn of the modern era. His collection included a large array of aggadot, although they were limited to those he considered within the domain of folklore.

The '''Keşlik Stele''' is a [[Neo-Hittite]] monument from northern [[Tyana]], near [[Niğde]] discovered in 1962 in southern [[Turkey]], which dates from the 8th century BC.

== Discovery ==
The stele was discovered by Vural Sezer in the ''Bayındır Yaylası'' summer pasture of the village of Keşlik, a plateau north of [[Altunhisar]] in [[Niğde Province]] and was installed in the Niğde Museum. The location of discovery was part of the [[Iron Age]] [[Luwian]] kingdom of [[Tuwana]]. According to the testimony of local landowner Abdullah Tanik about the find, it was discovered by Turkish archaeologist Aykut Çınaroğlu in a 1962 survey. The stele had probably fallen from a hill which rises 25 m above the surrounding fields, since a depression has been found there which could have contained the pedestal of a stele. The monument is now in the [[Niğde Archaeological Museum]] and has the inventory number 51.

== Description ==
The brown [[Basalt]] stele is 1.45 m high, 69&amp;nbsp;cm wide and about 27&amp;nbsp;cm thick. The upper surface is severely weathered and pock marked. The image depicts the weather god [[Tarhunzas]] facing right. He is dressed in a short kilt, a short-sleeved over-tunic with a wide belt, and thigh-high boots. His head is bearded and he has shoulder-length hair, covered by a horned helmet. His right hand is bent at his side and holds a cluster of grapes, while his left hand holds a bundle of corn ears. Thegrape cluster and the corn ears both grow up from the ground on either side of him.

In the space to the right, between the figure and the corn ears, [[John David Hawkins]] detected nine lines of an inscription, which probably continued on the side of the stele. Because of the poor state of preservation of the stele, it was not legible.

The image is very similar to the depiction of the weather god on the [[İvriz relief]]. As a result, the Keşlik stele is dated to the same time as it - the reig of King [[Warpalawas]] of Tuwana (740-705).

'''''Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley''''' is an [[oil painting]] on canvas completed by the French artist [[Paul Cézanne]] between 1882 and 1885. It depicts [[Montagne Sainte-Victoire]] and the valley of the [[Arc (Provence)|Arc River]], with Cézanne's hometown of [[Aix-en-Provence]] in the background. Once owned by the art collectors and patrons [[Henry Osborne Havemeyer|Henry]] and [[Louisine Havemeyer]], the painting was bequeathed to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]] after the latter's death in 1929.

== Description ==
The ''Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley'' was painted from 1882 to 1885, and was completed 21 years before Cézanne's artistic career finished.&lt;ref name="offline3"/&gt; Cézanne began working on [[Impressionism]] in his artworks in the late 19th century, nearing the end of his career, away from his post-impressionist former paintings. A later example of this can be seen in ''[[The Card Players]]''.&lt;ref name="offline1"/&gt; These mainly included still lifes and landscapes such as ''Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley''. His aim was "to make of Impressionism something solid and durable, like the art of museums."&lt;ref name="museums 1"&gt;"Paul Cézanne: Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley (29.100.64)". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000. Uploaded December 2008. Retrieved 30 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It was painted in the 'mature' period of Cézanne's work.&lt;ref name="web1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impressionistsgallery.co.uk/artists/Cezanne/1878-1890%20(1).html|title=Cezanne, 1878-1890 (20/1)|publisher=Impressionists Gallery|date=|accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley'' was a bequest to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by [[Henry Osborne Havemeyer]] and his wife [[Louisine Havemeyer|Louisine Waldron Elder Havemeyer]]. After Henry died in 1907, the work passed to Louisine; it was donated to the museum following her death in 1929 as part of the Havemeyer collection of 142 artworks.&lt;ref name="The Havemeyers Book 1"&gt;Weitzenhoffer, Frances. ''The Havemeyers: Impressionism Comes to America'' (Harry N. Abrams Publishers, New York). 1986. pp. 251—252.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting depicts the [[Montagne Sainte-Victoire]], which dominates the landscape of his native city of [[Aix-en-Provence]] (southern France). The city is visible in the distance, far back from the valley of the [[Arc (Provence)|Arc River]].&lt;ref name="doc1"&gt;Mont Sainte-Victoire. s885-i887. 2534  x  32'  s  inches. The H.  0.

The '''National Book Critics Circle''' ('''NBCC''') is an [[United States|American]] [[nonprofit organization]] ([[501(c) organization|501(c)(3)]]) with nearly 600 members. It is the [[professional association]] of American [[book review]] editors and critics, known primarily for the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]]s, a set of [[literary awards]] presented every March.

The organization was founded April 1974 in [[New York City]] by "[[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]], Nona Balakian, and Ivan Sandrof intending to extend the Algonquin round table to a national conversation".&lt;ref name=about&gt;
National Book Critics Circle ('''NBCC'''): About: [http://bookcritics.org/about/ "Thirty-five Years of Quality Writing and Criticism"]. Retrieved 2012-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was formally chartered October 1974 as a [[New York state]] non-profit corporation and the Advisory Board voted in November to establish annual literary awards.&lt;ref name=newsletter1975&gt;
[http://bookcritics.org/images/uploads/vol1no1march011975.pdf ''The National Book Critics Circle Journal'' 1:1, March 1, 1975], NBCC. Retrieved 2012-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the first newsletter three months later, President Ivan Sandrof proclaimed the primary purpose "to improve and maintain the standards of [[literary criticism]] in an era of diminishing and deteriorating values". At that time there were 140 members, with outreach to freelance critics planned for that year.&lt;ref name=newsletter1975/&gt;

NBCC first presented its Awards in January 1976 to books published during 1975 in four categories.&lt;ref name=newsletter1976&gt;
[http://bookcritics.org/images/uploads/vol2no1spring1976.pdf ''The National Book Critics Circle Journal'' 2:1, Spring 1976], NBCC. Retrieved 2012-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt;
Only active review editors and reviewers may be voting members; they elect the 24 Directors who formally make nominations and alone make final selections each year.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;&lt;ref name=members&gt;
[http://bookcritics.org/membership/ "Membership"] (no date), NBCC. Retrieved 2012-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fifth award category for books (Autobiography/Biography) was added for 1983 and divided in two for 2005. Since 2005 there are eight awards. Six National Book Critics Circle Awards recognize "best books" published in the United States during the preceding year in six categories: fiction, nonfiction, autobiography, biography, criticism, and poetry.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;
[http://www.bookcritics.org/faqs "Frequently Asked Questions"] (no date), NBCC. Retrieved 2012-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt;
Annually "the most accomplished reviewer" among its members is recognized by the [[National Book Critics Circle Award#Nona Balakian Citation for Excellence in Reviewing |Nona Balakian Citation for Excellence in Reviewing]] (from 1991).
The NBCC also recognizes no more than one person or organization for "exceptional contributions to books" with the [[National Book Critics Circle Award#Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award |Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award]] (from 1981 under more than one name).
&lt;!-- source: our article on the awards --&gt;
All eight awards are officially dated in the preceding year.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

As a professional association, NBCC also works to improve the quality of reviews and provides services to its members.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsletter1975/&gt;&lt;ref name=members/&gt;

'''Nicholas Matthews Condy''', or '''Nicholas Condy the Younger''' (1816 – 20 May 1851) was a British [[marine art|maritime painter]].

==Life==

===Birth and Education===

He was born in [[Union Street, Plymouth]] in 1816 to [[Nicholas Condy]] (1793–1857) and Ann Trevanion Condy (née Pyle; 1792–1860).  His father was a [[landscape art|painter of landscapes]], and they are often confused for each other. He went to the Mount Radford School in [[Exeter]] and later studied under The Reverend C Thomas of Lew Trenchard. Intended for a career in the [[British Army|Army]] or [[Royal Navy|Navy]], he instead became a professional [[marine painter]].

===Artistic career===

His work attracted the early admiration of [[George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont|the Earl of Egremont]], [[J M W Turner]]’s patron. Three of his sea-pieces were exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] from 1842 to 1845, which gave hopes of his becoming a distinguished artist.

===Death===

He lived in [[Plymouth]] until his sudden and premature death at the Grove, Plymouth, on 20 May 1851&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]], July to December 1851'', by Sylvanus Urban, John Bower Nichols and Son, London, 1851, p 101.&lt;/ref&gt; when aged only thirty-two.  He left a [[widow]], Flora Ross, the third daughter of Major John Lockhart Gallie, of the [[28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot|28th Regiment]] and a daughter, Harriet Charlotte Florence Pigott Condy (1846-1880) who married the painter [[Walter Duncan (painter)|Walter Duncan]] (1848-1932). After his death Flora married her cousin Samuel Charles Roby.

==Style and artistic achievement==

Condy used a detailed knowledge of ships acquired in his home town to paint accurate ship portraits, and his native [[Devon]] countryside is featured in such paintings as ''Ships off Devonport'' and ''The Post Office Packet Shelldrake off Falmouth'' (both in the [[National Maritime Museum]], London). He was a successful and established artist whose work is still sought after today.

'''''PROCESSIONS''''' was a mass participation artwork that took place in several British cities on 10 June 2018. The piece consisted of women and girls marching in cities and "forming a living portrait of women in the 21st century and a visual expression of equality, strength and cultural representation".&lt;ref name="1418now.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.1418now.org.uk/commissions/processions/|title=Processions - 14-18 NOW|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many men joined women in the subsequent marches.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44427627|title=Mass march celebrates women's suffrage|date=10 June 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One hundred textile banners created by female artists were carried during the four marches.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/arts/processions-how-to-march-like-a-suffragette-this-weekend-a3857011.html|title=How to march like a Suffragette this weekend|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece commemorated the 100th anniversary of the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], which granted [[suffrage]] to many British women.  It was one of a number of works commissioned by the British government's [[14-18 NOW]] project to mark the events of [[World War I]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="1418now.org.uk"/&gt;

Marches took place in Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh and London. The piece was produced by [[Artichoke (company)|Artichoke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/women-march-suffragette-right-vote-centenary-london-belfast-edinburgh-a8392376.html|title=Thousands march through major UK cities to celebrate centenary of women getting right to vote|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[Philosophy of education|teaching methodology]], process drama developed primarily from the work of [[Brian Way]], [[Dorothy Heathcote]] and [[Gavin Bolton]]&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1979) ''Towards a theory of drama in education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1984) ''Drama as education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1992) ''New Perspectives on Classroom Drama''. Nelson Thornes Ltd., London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. and Dorothy Heathcote (1995) ''Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education (Dimensions of Drama Series)''. Heinemann Drama.&lt;/ref&gt; and through the work of other leading [[drama]] practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Norah and Juliana Saxton (1987) ''Teaching Drama: A Mind of Many Wonders.'' Trans-Atlantic Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neelands, Jonothan and Tony Goode (2000) ''Structuring Drama Work: A handbook of available forms in theatre and drama''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Cecily (1995) ''Drama Worlds: A Framework for Process Drama (The Dimensions of Drama)''. Heinemann Drama.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, John (1992) ''The Process of Drama: Negotiating Art and Meaning.'' Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrice Baldwin|Baldwin, Patrice]] (1991) ''Stimulating drama: Cross curricular approaches to drama in the primary school.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecily O'Neill]] describes process drama being used to explore a problem, situation, theme or series of related ideas or themes through the use of the artistic medium of unscripted drama. Process drama was described by O'Mara (1999) as" a dynamic way of working that requires teachers to reflect-in-action",&lt;ref&gt;O'Mara, Joanne. 1999. Unravelling the Mystery: A Study of Reflection-in-Action in Process Drama Teaching.Thesis (PhD Doctorate), Griffith University, Brisbane. Accessible at: https://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/items/427f6837-6772-8177-ddc0-5a341ddb544d/1/ &lt;/ref&gt; constantly dealing with unique situations that require novel approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Schön, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; It has its roots in dramatic play, where normally developing children in every [[culture]] in the world will create their own imagined worlds, often with the co-participation of an [[empathy|empathetic]] adult (usually the parent) in role.

Process drama in school settings usually involves the whole class working with the teacher in role in a made-up [[scenario]].  When they are working in process drama, the students and teachers work together to create an imaginary dramatic world within which issues are considered and problems can be solved. In this world they work together to explore problems and issues such as, "How do communities deal with change?", "How do we accept other people into our community?" or themes such as environmental [[sustainability]], betrayal, truth and other [[ethical]] and moral issues. Sometimes the work may begin as light-hearted, but the teacher always layers more dramatic tension and complexity into the work as the teacher is aiming for a [[pedagogical]] outcome. Students learn to think beyond their own points of view and consider multiple perspectives on a topic through playing different roles. For instance, if the issue being discussed is logging a forest, they may play the [[Lumberjack|loggers]], people who live in the forest community and [[environmentalist]]s. Playing a range of positions encourages them to be able to recast themselves as the "other" and to consider life from that viewpoint, thereby creating complexity and enabling us to explore multiple dimensions of the topic.  Process drama does what the character [[Atticus Finch]] advocates: the ability to work for [[social justice]] comes from the ability to understand another perspective—to be able to try on someone else's shoes and walk around in them for a while. Process drama allows us to "try on" other people's shoes, to walk the paths they tread and to see how the world looks from their point of view.

Process drama is also suggested as a tool to promote literacy development through opportunities for dramatic play in early childhood settings within which children speak for a range of purposes in role.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Ping-Yun.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14784">'''Qingyang sachet''', also known as "'''chu chu'''" or '''"shua huo"''' (hidden stitch) is a [[folk custom]] of [[Qingyang]], [[Gansu]], China. Sachets are created from small pieces of silk, which are [[Embroidery|embroidered]] with colorful strings in a variety of patterns according to [[papercutting]] designs. The silk is then sewn into different shapes and filled with cotton and spices. Qingyang sachets symbolize blessing, auspiciousness, happiness, safety, peace, and avoidance of evil, disaster, [[illness]]es, and misfortune.&lt;ref name="wong"&gt;Wong, A. (2009, December 29). Qingyang sachet. Retrieved from https://web.archive.org/web/20100120112148/http://www.easthv.com/qingyang-sachet.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many sachets are also filled with [[cinnabar]], [[Acorus calamus|calamus]], [[Artemisia vulgaris|wormwood]], and [[chrysanthemum]], and they are commonly used as [[air freshener]]s, [[insect repellent]], and protection against evil spirits.&lt;ref name="sachets"&gt;Sachets. (2014). Retrieved from https://festival.si.edu/2014/china/through-the-seasons/sachets/smithsonian&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Historically sachet has also gone by the names of purse, "xiangnang," "peiwei," and "rongchou". In Qingyang, however, it is commonly known as "chu chu" or "shua huo" "Chu" originally referred to the original method of using bone needles for [[sewing]], but later referred to the sachet itself, which is made of cloth. In local Qingyang culture, it may also be called purse or “shua huo zi.”&lt;ref name="wong" /&gt;

Historians differ on the exact origins of the sachet. One account dates it around 2300 BC. Another accredits the sachet to the mythological doctor [[Qibo]] and to a passage in the [[Huangdi Neijing]], which has been dated between the late [[Warring States period]] (475-221 BCE) and the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE-220 CE).&lt;ref name="wong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huangdi"&gt;The Su Wen of the Huangdi Neijing (Inner Classic of the Yellow Emperor). (2018, January 3). Retrieved from https://www.wdl.org/en/item/3044/&lt;/ref&gt; More rooted in tangible history, the sachet appeared in the Warring States period as distinctive decorations worn as a clothing accessory as well as [[mosquito]] repellent. The origins of the “fragrant sachet” has been assigned to rural Chinese women during the Han dynasty. During this time, an account appeared in the [[Book of Rites]], compiled by [[Dai Sheng]], which described the popularity of perfumed and embroidered brocade sachets, especially among young people who wore these sachets around their wrists, necks, and waists. They were also popular in the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618-906) and [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960-1279) dynasties, but were mainly luxuries for the wealthy and powerful. Qingyang’s male officials and women from elite families wore sachets filled with [[traditional Chinese medicine]] rather than perfume. Sachets would later be used as tokens of love and affection in the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1661).&lt;ref name="cctv"&gt;Celebrating the sachet in Qingyang. (2009, May 30). Retrieved from http://english.cctv.com/20090530/100797.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wentong"&gt;Wentong, G. (2017, July 21). Qingyang sachets impress world with fragrance, needlework. Retrieved from http://www.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/html1/culture/arts/1707/5051-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest existing sachet is approximately 800 years old. In 2001 people excavated stone [[pagoda]]s from the Song dynasty in Qingyang. They found a sachet embroidered with plums and lotus flowers, its pattern still clear despite the passage of time. Thus the sachet earned the name “Longevity Sachet.”&lt;ref name="wong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wentong" /&gt;

In 2002, China Folklore Society named Qingyang City "the Hometown of Embroidery Sachets." In 2006, China's State Council included Qingyang sachets in the first official batch of "National Intangible Cultural Heritage," promoting the sachets as the cultural brand of foreign exchange of Qingyang City.&lt;ref name="han" /&gt;

Today the sachet is seen most commonly at the [[Dragon Boat Festival]], in which the making and wearing of "chu chu" is a local custom. Festival goers and locals use sachets filled with herbal medicine to pray for their health while many children wear them in hopes of increasing their intelligence, peace, and health.
Many popular mainstream sachets are created by Qingyang Lingyun Clothing Co., Ltd., with Zhang Zhifeng as chairperson, who is an inheritor of sachet-making. The company employs 200 people and creates 40 million yuan worth of clothing and sachets annually. The company purchases sachets from rural women, processes them, and then resells the sachets to the public.&lt;ref name="wentong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guoqing"&gt;Guoqing, G. (2014, May 26).

==Types==
There are four main ways to construct a sachet, involving unique needlework, attaching accessories, and the sachet's overall shape:&lt;ref name="wong" /&gt;
#'''Chu chu''': This sachet entails hiding the needles while embroidering, thus creating a sachet without visible stitching.
#'''Spool''': This sachet is made with many colors and is designed in the shape of [[Zongzi]] (a pyramid-shaped mass of glutinous rice wrapped in leaves).
#'''3D:''' These sachets can be complicated, with accessories dangling from one or all sides of the sachet. There are up to 400 formats of the 3D sachet.
#'''Plain embroidery''': This sachet is simple, focusing mainly on the embroidery itself than the sachet's construction.

==Common symbols and patterns==
Qingyang sachets often exhibit repeated symbols and patterns, reflecting Qingyang's past and present traditions, beliefs, and religion. Sachets are typically embroidered with flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="cctv" /&gt; Since ancient times, Qingyang’s dominant philosophical strongholds have been [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]], and their various tenants appear symbolically and thematically in the designs of sachets. Important Confucianist ideals are [[filial piety]], strength-borrowing (achieving one’s objectives through the strength of others), the Five Bonds (ruler to ruled, father to son, husband to wife, elder brother to younger brother, and friend to friend), and the doctrine of the “mean” and “neutralization” (being impartial and in harmonious portion while dealing with the everyday). Taoism, on the other hand, places emphasis on [[quietism (philosophy)|quietism]], effortless action, and [[immortality]]. The main philosophy that emerges from these two traditions is that man is an integral part of nature and should therefore follow natural laws, which dominates the symbolism adorning Qingyang sachets. In addition, many symbols retain Buddhist ideals also circulated in the region, such as the golden fish and [[swastika]].&lt;ref name="wong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="han"&gt;Han, X. (2018). Confucianism and Taoism embodied in the patterns on the sachets of Qingyang, China. ''Advances in Social Science, Education, and Humanities Research, 205''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sachets typically consist of one of four patterns: shape-oriented, meaning-oriented, [[homophone]]-oriented, and heterogeneous patterns. Shared-oriented patterns include patterns that have shared-shapes (shapes intertwined or side-by-side), shape(s)-inside-shape(s) (an image within an image), and combined-shapes (two images melded together, typically an animal and a human). Shape-oriented patterns use easily recognizable images from local traditions to convey a story or idea. Meaning-oriented patterns convey a specific meaning and thus a specific purpose, such as praying for one's sons. Homophone-oriented patterns display various images, which represent words that share similar pronunciations as homophones. This allows for [[word play]]. Heterogeneous patterns consist of varying images and symbols versus a limited set of only few, as seen in the other three patterns.&lt;ref name="han" /&gt;

Researchers and sachet [[artisan]]s have compiled a various symbols and patterns common to Qingyang sachets, many of which are cataloged below.

*'''[[Bagua]]''': This image derives from Taoist cosmology, consisting of combinations of three whole or broken lines.&lt;ref name="han" /&gt; 
*'''"Boy-fish"''': This pattern is one of combined-shapes, featuring the head of boy melded with the body of fish. The use of animals to express human desires and aspirations most likely derives from totem worship in ancient China. The boy-fish represents the ancient Chinese worship of the abilities of fish, including prolificacy and swimming. Improving oneself with the abilities of other animals is in line with the Confucian ideal of "being good at making use of materials," and the combination of fish and human represents the Confucian value of "harmony between man and nature."&lt;ref name="han" /&gt;
*'''Cranes under pine trees''': This pattern symbolizes [[longevity]], a Taoist ideal.&lt;ref name="wentong" /&gt;
*'''Dragon and phoenix''': This auspicious pattern depicts both dragons and phoenixes, representing prosperity and good luck.&lt;ref name="wentong" /&gt;
*'''Fish''': The totem of the Pre [[Zhou dynasty]], originating from North Bin. A single fish can also represent a [[penis]] while double fish may represent [[vulva|vulvae]], thus also signifying the worship of [[Nüwa]], the Chinese goddess of creation. Fish may also represent maternity and ancient fertility worship.&lt;ref name="cctv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="han" /&gt;
*'''"Fish-lotus-boy"''': A typical image used to express love, the fish-lotus-boy depicts procreation with a fish swimming through a lotus flower. The fish represents the male while the lotus represents the female, with a depiction of a boy who has been created through this process. This image indirectly expresses the desire for male offspring as well as "filial piety."&lt;ref name="han" /&gt;
*'''Frog''': The frog signifies continuing matrilineal worship and the worship of Nüwa. Because the Chinese symbol for frog has similar pronunciation as the Chinese symbol for baby, frogs also appear in sachets that are blessings for a newborn.&lt;ref name="cctv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="han" /&gt;
*'''Golden fish''': This image originates in [[Culture of Buddhism|Buddhist culture]], typically appearing as a pair of golden fishes. It is one of the eight auspicious symbols or [[Ashtamangala]]. It represents happiness, impulsiveness, fertility, profusion, freedom, conjugal harmony, and loyalty. [[Culture of Buddhism|Buddhist culture]].&lt;ref name="han" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dundruk, K. (2018, April 27). 8 Auspicious Symbols of Tibetan Buddhism. ''Tibet Vista''. Retrieved from https://www.tibettravel.org/tibetan-buddhism/8-auspicious-symbols-of-tibetan-buddhism.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Heart, gold ingot, and butterfly''': These images typically appear on brightly-colored sachets, which result from and symbolize a woman's wisdom.&lt;ref name="wentong" /&gt;
*'''"Immortals-turtles-peach"''': This pattern is typical of sachets used to pray for longevity. The traditional Chinese character for longevity (壽) is placed in the center with two turtles each carrying four immortals placed symmetrically around the character. Atop the character is a peach. The image of the [[Eight Immortals]] invokes ancient Chinese idol worship and prayer for immortal life. Both turtles and peaches are metaphors for longevity in Taoist fairytales. These images represent the Taoist ideal of "Nourishing of life."&lt;ref name="han" /&gt;
*'''"Lotus-boy"''': A combination of a lotus and a virgin boy, this image is typical of those conveying praying for sons. It represents the desire for offspring, per the Confucian saying of “having no male heir is the gravest of the three cardinal offenses against filial piety.” Lotuses also have many seeds (“籽”in Chinese). The character 籽 (seed) is pronounced “zi," which has the same pronunciation as "son" (子). Because males inherit property in a patriarchal clan system, praying for one's sons over one's daughters embodies the patriarchal local folk cultural ideals of “valuing the male child only” and “carrying on the family line.” In addition, "lotus" (莲), pronounced as "lian,"has a similar pronunciation as "one after the other" (连), meaning praying for honorable sons one after the other.&lt;ref name="han" /&gt;
*'''[[Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus flower]]''': This Buddhist image represents the universe. A white lotus signifies purity while a yellow lotus denotes spiritual ascension. A lotus may also represent vulvae.&lt;ref name="han" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, K. (2017, April 28). The secret meaning of the lotus flower. ''Town &amp; Country''. Retrieved from https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a9550430/lotus-flower-meaning/&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mandarin ducks playing on water''': This pattern symbolizes a devoted couple living in peace and harmony.&lt;ref name="wentong" /&gt;
*'''"Rooster-fish-maize"''': This pattern includes two roosters, two fish, and two pieces of maize cobs, a type homophone-oriented pattern. "Rooster" (鸡) is pronounced as "ji"similar to 吉 (auspicious omen). "Fish" (鱼) and "maize" (玉米) are both pronounced "yu," similar to 余 (affluence). These homophones refer to the desire for auspicious and a prosperous life, including a good harvest with a grain surplus and a higher social status, in line with the Confucian ideal of "engaged in social life."&lt;ref name="han" /&gt;
*'''"Six-happy-babies"''': This is a typical shared-shaped pattern, formed by two baby girls and a baby boy joined by their arms, legs, and torsos. This represents the wish for more offspring and is consistent with the Confucian ideal of harmony.&lt;ref name="han" /&gt;
*'''Snake''': An image representing continuing matrilineal worship and the worship of Nüwa.&lt;ref name="han" /&gt;
*'''Swastika''': An image from Buddhism, used to represent auspiciousness.&lt;ref name="han" /&gt;
*'''[[Taijitu]]''': An image from Chinese philosophy, used to represent auspiciousness.&lt;ref name="han" /&gt; 
*'''Tiger''': A [[totem]] of “the Western toad family”, the original inhabitants of Qingyang district. Tigers also signify subduing and warding off evil spirits, accounting for their popularity.&lt;ref name="cctv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="han" /&gt;
*"'''Tweeted-totter-snakes"''': This shape-inside-shape pattern depicts a tortoise in the middle of two snakes. This image signifies the Confucian doctrine of "Mean" and neutralization as well as the theme of "seeking longevity" in Chinese culture. The snakes and tortoise also represent Confucian "harmony" and the "power of team" while the distinction between the primary (the tortoise, the center of the pattern) and the secondary (the snakes) represents Confucian "hierarchy."&lt;ref name="han" /&gt;

The '''Rental Car Rally''' is a 36-hour city-to-city road rally that takes place &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; on public roads several times a year in different cities, with a different route each time. Founded in 2008 by the organizers of Wiimbledon and Street Wars, RCR sees an annual entry of about 30 cars per rally, with each team required to compete in a themed costume of their choosing, so long as the costume includes their vehicle. The rally is not a serious race in the traditional sense of competitive rally driving,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=Complex.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; though teams win by merit of their costumes and low mileage. Organizers emphasize that Rental Car Rally is a road trip and not a race.

==History==
Drawing inspiration from the ''[[Cannonball Run (film)|Cannonball Run]]'' films, ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'', the ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]'' cartoons as well as the [[Gumball 3000]], the Rental Car Rally was born as a more reasonable alternative to for those wanting to participate in a rally but who may not have the time and money required to complete in events such as the Bullrun and the Gumball 3000.

The first Rental Car Rally took place on August 15–17, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route required that participants drive from New York to Montreal, attend a party and drive back to NYC.

==Rally==

===2008 NYC to Montreal===
The inaugural rally featured 74 cars and 189 participants, and traveled from Long Island City, Queens to Montreal, Canada. Drivers were required to stop at 5 checkpoints along the route (which necessitated that mostly local roads were used) and collect evidence of their passing through them. 3 cars never made it to Montreal due to mechanical problems and 1 team - Jake's Clown Car - did not make it back from Montreal due to an accident in which no one was injured. The winner drove a van converted to resemble an emergency blood delivery vehicle.

'''''Saint Sebastian''''' is an early sculpture by the Italian artist [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]. Executed in 1617 and 1618, it features the Christian martyr [[Saint Sebastian]] pinned to a tree, his flesh filled with arrows. It is smaller than life size. The sculpture is part of the [[Carmen Cervera]]'s private collection and is currently shown in the [[Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza]] in Madrid.&lt;ref name="wittkower-232"&gt;Wittkower 1955, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7806">Beginning in the 1970s, with the popularity of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' series, a variety of independent bookstores specializing in science fiction, fantasy, horror, and related genres (often mystery, comics, games, and/or collectibles), began opening.&lt;ref name="bdp1008"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ken |last=Bullock |work=The Berkeley Daily Planet |title=The Other Change of Hobbit is Living in South Berkeley |url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2010-08-10/article/36052?headline=The-Other-Change-of-Hobbit-Thrives-in-South-Berkeley |date=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first were [[Bakka-Phoenix Bookstore]] in Toronto and [[A Change of Hobbit]] in Southern California, both established in 1972.

The Treasury '''Section of Painting and Sculpture''' (later known as the  '''Section of Fine Arts'''), commonly known as the Section, was established in 1934 and administered by the Procurement Division of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]].  It continued until 1943,&lt;ref&gt; Park, Marlene and Gerald E. Markowitz, ‘’Democratic Vistas: Post Offices and Public Art in the New Deal’’, Temple University Press, Philadelphia, 1984 p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; ending with the death of its director, [[Edward Bruce (New Deal)|Edward Bruce]].

== Overview ==
Like the [[Works Progress Administration]], the Section was part of a government project aimed at providing work for Americans throughout the [[Great Depression]] during the 1930s. The Section's main function was to select high quality art to decorate public buildings in the form of [[murals]], making art accessible to all people. Because post offices were usually visited by everyone, they were the places selected to display these projects.  Commissioned artists were provided with the guidelines and themes for each project, and scenes of local interest and events were generally represented.  The muralist movement was inspired by the [[Mexican murals|Mexican muralists]], but Section murals did not portray the harsh social or economic realities of the time. Rather, they celebrated historical events and courageous acts. Many of these murals have disappeared, or fallen into disrepair, others have been restored thanks to renewed interest in their historical and artistic significance.&lt;ref name="Raynor"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Raynor, Patricia | work=Enroute | volume=6 | number=4 | date=October–December 1997 | title=Off The Wall: New Deal Post Office Murals | url=http://postalmuseum.si.edu/research/articles-from-enroute/off-the-wall.html | publisher=[[National Postal Museum]], [[Smithsonian Institution]], USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painters of these murals include [[Ralf Henricksen]], [[Henrietta Shore]] and [[Suzanne Scheuer]].

In existence during the [[Great Depression]] in the [[United States]], the Section of Painting and Sculpture was a [[public art]] program administered by the Procurement Division of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] as part of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]].  Like other New Deal public art programs, the Section (as it was commonly called) was designed to increase employment among artists, but it was unusual in awarding commissions competitively, based on artistic talent.  In total, the Section commissioned more than 1,300 murals and 300 sculptures, many of which were placed in [[post office]]s throughout the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?programId=8996&amp;channelId=-17423&amp;ooid=18893&amp;contentId=18963&amp;pageTypeId=8199&amp;contentType=GSA_BASIC&amp;programPage=%2Fep%2Fprogram%2FgsaBasic.jsp&amp;P=WPB GSA: Federal Art Programs] summary prepared by the [[General Services Administration]]. Retrieved May 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
The Section was created in 1934 and led by [[Edward Bruce (New Deal)|Edward Bruce]].  Bruce had also led the Treasury Department's [[Public Works of Art Project]], the first federal art program, created in 1933 after the American painter [[George Biddle]] suggested the idea to President Roosevelt.  Other federal art programs followed, including the [[Federal Art Project]] (created in 1935 by the [[Works Progress Administration]], an independently operating federal agency) and the [[Treasury Relief Art Project]] (created in 1935 with funds granted by the WPA to the Treasury Department).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpamurals.com/history.html  History of New Deal Art Projects]. Retrieved May 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Section of Painting and Sculpture was renamed as the Section of Fine Arts in 1939 and operated until 1942.

The Section’s primary objective was to "secure suitable art of the best quality available for the embellishment of public buildings." Artworks created under the Section of Fine Arts were site-specific murals and sculptures for newly constructed federal buildings and post offices.  1% of the costs of each new federal building was set aside to fund the program.&lt;ref name="Raynor" /&gt;

==Art==
Unlike the other New Deal art programs, the Section awarded commissions through competitions and paid artists a lump sum for their work.  Competitions were open to all artists, regardless of economic status, and artists' proposals were reviewed without identifying the name of the artist who had made the submission.&lt;ref name="Raynor" /&gt;  

The Section sought entries that reflected local interests and events, and the Section encouraged the artists to think of the communities, not the Section, as the artists' "patron."&lt;ref name="Raynor" /&gt;  Indeed, artists awarded commissions were encouraged to visit the community to ensure that their murals reflected the community.  Although many of the artists did not make such visits, it was common for artists to correspond with the town (as well as the Post Office Department and the Section). Some local communities rejected the approved designs, and the artists would work to respond to these concerns and save their commissions.&lt;ref name="Raynor" /&gt;

The program also encouraged artists to reflect the building’s function. For example, the [[William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building]], constructed in the early 1930s as the headquarters for the U.S. Post Office Department and one of the first buildings to receive works of art under this program, contains 25 murals created with support from the Section intended to depict the history of mail delivery and the settlement of the [[Western United States|American West]]. These murals have been the subject of complaints about stereotypes of women, Native Americans, African Americans, and rural Americans, which were addressed by the [[General Services Administration]].&lt;ref name="GSA Clinton Art"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.gsa.gov/m/vpb/01028/art.html |title=Where's the Art |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=[[General Services Administration]] |access-date=2015-06-19 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618235716/http://m.gsa.gov/m/vpb/01028/art.html |archive-date=2015-06-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
In 1939, under the [[Reorganization Act of 1939|Reorganization Act]], all Treasury Department and WPA arts programs were incorporated into the [[Federal Works Agency]], but the outbreak of [[World War II]] and other factors were soon to end the programs. Edward Bruce died of a heart attack in January 1943. By the end of 1943, all of the New Deal art programs had been shut down.

'''Sexual attraction''' is [[Attractiveness|attraction]] on the basis of [[sexual desire]] or the quality of arousing such interest.&lt;ref name="Sexual attraction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual attraction| publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|accessdate=December 16, 2011|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sexual+attraction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexual attraction2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual attraction| publisher=[[Reference.com]]|accessdate=December 16, 2011|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexual+attraction}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Sexual attractiveness''' or '''sex appeal''' is an individual's ability to attract the [[Human sexuality|sexual]] or [[erotic]] interests of other people, and is a factor in [[sexual selection]] or [[mate choice]]. The attraction can be to the [[physical attraction|physical]] or other qualities or traits of a person, or to such qualities in the context where they appear. The attraction may be to a person's [[aesthetics]] or movements or to their voice or smell, besides other factors. The attraction may be enhanced by a person's adornments, clothing, perfume or [[hair style|style]]. It can be influenced by [[individual]] [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], or cultural factors, or to other, more amorphous qualities. Sexual attraction is also a response to another person that depends on a combination of the person possessing the traits and on the criteria of the person who is attracted.

Though attempts have been made to devise objective criteria of sexual attractiveness and measure it as [[individual capital|one of several bodily forms of]] [[capital asset]] (''see [[erotic capital]]''), a person's sexual attractiveness is to a large extent a subjective measure dependent on another person's interest, perception, and [[sexual orientation]]. For example, a [[Homosexuality|gay or lesbian person]] would typically find a person of the [[Same-sex attraction|same sex]] to be more attractive than one of the other sex. A [[bisexuality|bisexual person]] would find either sex to be attractive. [[Asexuality]] refers to those who do not experience sexual attraction for either sex, though they may have romantic attraction (homoromantic, biromantic or heteroromantic) or a non-directed libido.&lt;ref name=asexualityarchive&gt;{{cite web|title=Things That Are Not Asexuality|url=http://www.asexualityarchive.com/things-that-are-not-asexuality/|website=Asexuality Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Interpersonal attraction]] includes factors such as [[propinquity|physical or psychological similarity]], [[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|familiarity]] or possessing a preponderance of [[Koinophilia#Physical attractiveness|common or familiar features]], [[similarity (psychology)|similarity]], [[Interpersonal compatibility|complementarity]], [[reciprocal liking]], and [[reinforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, R., Perlman, D., and Brehm, S.S. Intimate Relationships, 4th Edition, McGrawHill Companies.{{page needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of a person's physical and other qualities to create a sexual interest in others is the basis of their use in [[sex in advertising|advertising]], [[Sex in film|film]], and other visual media, as well as in [[Model (person)|modeling]] and other occupations.

In evolutionary terms, the [[ovulatory shift hypothesis]] posits that female humans exhibit different sexual behaviours and desires at points in their [[menstrual cycle]], as a means to ensure that they attract a high quality mate to copulate with during their most [[Fertile window|fertile]] time. Hormone levels throughout the menstrual cycle affect a woman's overt behaviours, influencing the way a woman presents herself to others during stages of her menstrual cycle, in attempt to attract high quality mates the closer the woman is to [[ovulation]].&lt;ref name="Pillsworth"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pillsworth|first1=Elizabeth G.|last2=Haselton|first2=Martie G.|last3=Buss|first3=David M.|title=Ovulatory Shifts in Female Sexual Desire|journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=February 2004|volume=41|issue=1|pages=55–65|doi=10.1080/00224490409552213|pmid=15216424|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulatoryshifts.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and biological factors==
[[Human sexuality]] has many aspects. In [[biology]], sexuality describes the reproductive mechanism and the basic biological drive that exists in all sexually reproducing species and can encompass [[sexual intercourse]] and sexual contact in all its forms. There are also emotional and physical aspects of sexuality. These relate to the bond between individuals, which may be expressed through profound feelings or emotions. [[Sociology|Sociologically]], it can cover the [[Culture|cultural]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Law|legal]] aspects; [[philosophy|philosophically]], it can span the [[morality|moral]], [[ethics|ethical]], [[theology|theological]], [[spirituality|spiritual]], and [[religion|religious]] aspects.

Which aspects of a person's sexuality attract another is influenced by [[cultural]] factors; it has varied over time as well as personal factors. Influencing factors may be determined more locally among sub-cultures, across [[sexual field]]s, or simply by the preferences of the [[individual]]. These preferences come about as a result of a complex variety of [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], and cultural factors.

A person's [[physical appearance]] has a critical impact on their sexual attractiveness. This involves the impact one's appearance has on the [[sense]]s, especially in the beginning of a relationship:

* [[Visual perception]] (the symmetry of [[Facial symmetry|the face]], [[physical attractiveness]], [[Human skin|health]], and how they act or move, for example, while dancing);
* [[Hearing (sense)|Audition]] (how the other's [[human voice|voice]] and movements [[sound]]);
* [[Olfaction]] (how the other smells, naturally or artificially; the wrong smell may be repellent).

As with other animals, [[pheromone]]s may have an impact, though less significantly in the case of humans. Theoretically, the "wrong" pheromone may cause someone to be disliked, even when they would otherwise appear attractive. Frequently, a pleasant-smelling [[perfume]] is used to encourage the member of the opposite sex to more deeply inhale the [[air]] surrounding its wearer,{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} increasing the [[probability]] that the individual's pheromones will be inhaled. The importance of pheromones in human relationships is probably limited and is widely disputed,{{unreliable source?|date=December 2012}}&lt;ref name="disputed"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_206.html | title = Will pheromones make you irresistible to the opposite sex? | work = The Straight Dope | accessdate = November 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it appears to have some scientific basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=0007F9B4-B6D4-1C60-B882809EC588ED9F&amp;sc=I100322 | title = First Evidence of a Human Response to Pheromones | work = ScientificAmerican.com | accessdate = November 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people exhibit high levels of [[sexual fetishism]] and are [[sexually stimulated]] by other stimuli not normally associated with [[sexual arousal]]. The degree to which such fetishism exists or has existed in different cultures is controversial.

Pheromones have been determined to play a role in sexual attraction between people. They influence gonadal hormone secretion, for example, follicle maturation in the ovaries in females and testosterone and sperm production in males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at/institutes/urbanethology/resources/articles/articles/publications/226-2005-humanPheromones-sexAttraction.pdf |title=doi:10.1016/j.ejogrb.2004.08.010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High anxiety==
{{primary sources|section|date=December 2012}}
Research conducted by Donald G. Dutton and Arthur P. Aron in the 1970s aimed to find the relation between sexual attraction and high anxiety conditions. In doing so, 85 male participants were contacted by an attractive female interviewer at either a fear-arousing suspension bridge or a normal bridge. Conclusively, it was shown that the male participants who were asked to by the female interviewer to perform the [[thematic apperception test]] (TAT) on the fear-arousing bridge, wrote more sexual content in the stories and attempted, with greater effort, to contact the interviewer after the experiment than those participants who performed the TAT on the normal bridge. In another test, a male participant, chosen from a group of 80, was given anticipated shocks. With him was an attractive female confederate, who was also being shocked. The experiment showed that the male's sexual imagery in the TAT was much higher when self shock was anticipated and not when the female confederate shock was anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dutton|first=Donald G|author2=Arthur P. Aron |title=Some evidence for heightened sexual attraction under conditions of high anxiety|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1974|volume=30|issue=4|doi=10.1037/h0037031|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/30/4/510/|pages=510–7|pmid=4455773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enhancement ==
People consciously or subconsciously enhance their sexual attractiveness or sex appeal for a number of reasons. It may be to attract someone with whom they can form a deeper relationship, for [[companionship]], [[procreation]], or an [[intimate relationship]], besides other possible purposes. It can be part of a [[courtship]] process. This can involve physical aspects or interactive processes whereby people find and attract potential partners, and maintain a relationship. These processes, which involve attracting a partner and maintaining sexual interest, can include [[flirting]], which can be used to attract the sexual attention of another to encourage romance or sexual relations, and can involve [[body language]], conversation, joking, or brief physical contact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html SIRC Guide to Flirting. What Social Science can tell you about flirting and how to do it.] Retrieved October 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex and sexuality differences ==
Men have been found to have a greater interest in [[Casual sex|uncommitted sex]] compared to women.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. M., &amp; Shmitt, D. P. (1993). Sexual strategies theory: A contextual evolutionary analysis of human mating. ‘’Psychological Review’’: 100, 204-232.&lt;/ref&gt; Some research shows this interest to be more sociological than biological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conley | first1 = T. D. | year = 2011 | title = Perceived proposer personality characteristics and gender differences in acceptance of casual sex offers | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 100 | issue = 2| pages = 309–29| doi=10.1037/a0022152 | pmid=21171789}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men have a greater interest in visual sexual stimuli than women. However,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = B.J. | last2 = Symons | first2 = D. | year = 1990 | title = Sex differences in sexual fantasy: An evolutionary psychological approach | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 527–555 | doi=10.1080/00224499009551579}}&lt;/ref&gt; additional trends have been found with a greater sensitivity to [[Social status|partner status]] in women choosing a [[sexual partner]] and men placing a greater emphasis on [[physical attractiveness]] in a potential mate, as well as a significantly greater tendency toward sexual [[jealousy]] in men and emotional jealousy in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiederman | first1 = M. W. | last2 = Allgeier | first2 = E. R. | year = 1992 | title = Gender differences in mate selection criteria: Sociobiological or socioeconomic explanation? | url = | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 115–124 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(92)90021-u}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey, Gaulin, Agyei, and Gladue (1994) analyzed whether these results varied according to [[sexual orientation]]. In general, they found biological sex played a bigger role in the psychology of sexual attraction than orientation. However, there were some differences between homosexual and heterosexual women and men on these factors. While gay and straight men showed similar psychological interest in casual sex on markers of [[Sociosexual orientation|sociosexuality]], gay men showed a larger number of partners in behaviour expressing this interest (proposed to be due to a difference in opportunity). Self-identified lesbian women showed a significantly greater interest in visual sexual stimuli than heterosexual women and judged partner status to be less important in [[Romance (love)|romantic partnerships]]. Heterosexual men had a significantly greater preference for younger partners than homosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bailey | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Gaulin | first2 = S. | last3 = Agyei | first3 = Y. | last4 = Gladue | first4 = B. | year = 1994 | title = Effects of gender and sexual orientation on evolutionarily relevant aspects of human mating psychology | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 66 | issue = 6| pages = 1081–1093 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.6.1081 | pmid=8046578}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who identify as [[Asexuality|asexual]] may not be sexually attracted to anyone. [[Gray asexuality]] includes those who only experience sexual attraction under certain circumstances; for example, exclusively after an emotional bond has been formed. This tends to vary from person to person.

== Sexual preferences and hormones ==
The [[ovulatory shift hypothesis]] refers to the idea that female humans tend to exhibit different sexual behaviours and desires at points in their cycle, as an evolutionarily adaptive means to ensure that a high quality male is chosen to copulate with during the most fertile period of the cycle.&lt;ref name="Pillsworth" /&gt; It is thought that, due to the length of time and the parental investment involved for a woman to reproduce, changes in female psychology during menstrual periods would help them make critical decisions in mating selection. For example, it has been suggested that women's sexual preferences shift toward more masculine physical characteristics during peak phases of fertility. In such, a symmetrical and masculine face outwardly indicates the reproductive value of a prospective mate.&lt;ref name="Gangestad1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gangestad|first1=S. W.|last2=Thornhill|first2=R.|title=Menstrual cycle variation in women's preferences for the scent of symmetrical men|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=22 May 1998|volume=265|issue=1399|pages=927–933|doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0380|pmid=9633114|url=http://www.mta.ca/~raiken/Courses/3401/Labs/Lab%20Papers/sym2.pdf|pmc=1689051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gangestad1998"/&gt;

===Ovulation and female sexual preferences===

There is evidence that women's mate preferences differ across the [[ovarian cycle]]. A meta analysis, investigating 50 studies about whether women's mate preferences for good gene-related male traits changed across the ovarian cycle found that women's preferences change across their cycle: Women show the greatest preference for good gene male traits at their most fertile window.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Gildersleeve | first=Kelly | last2=Haselton | first2=Martie G | date=2014 | title=Do Women's Mate Preferences Change Across the Ovulatory Cycle: A Meta Analytic Review | url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/gildersleeve%20et%20al.%20sex%20roles%202013.pdf | journal=Psychological Bulletin | doi=10.1037/a0035438 | pmid=24564172 | volume=140 | issue=5 | pages=1205–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female sexual preference for male face shapes has been shown to vary with the probability of conception. Findings showed that during a 'high conception' stage of the menstrual cycle, women were more attracted to men with less feminine/more masculine faces for short-term relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penton-Voak|first1=I. S.|last2=Perrett|first2=D. I.|last3=Castles|first3=D. L.|last4=Kobayashi|first4=T|last5=Burt|first5=D. M.|title=Menstrual cycle alters face preference|journal=Nature|date=June 1999|volume=399|issue=6738|pages=741–742|bibcode=1999Natur.399..741P|doi=10.1038/21557|pmid=10391238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike men, women's sexual arousal has been found to be generic—it is non-specific to either men or women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rieger|first=Gerulf|date=2015|title=Sexual arousal and masculinity-femininity of women|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|doi=10.1037/pspp0000077|pmid=26501187|volume=111|issue=2|pages=265–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aforementioned research suggests that there may be a possibility that female sexual arousal becomes more sex-specific during the most fertile points of the menstrual cycle.

In males, a masculine face has been positively correlated with fewer respiratory diseases and, as a consequence, masculine features offer a marker of [[health]] and [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thornhill|first1=Randy|last2=Gangestad|first2=Steven W.|title=Facial sexual dimorphism, developmental stability, and susceptibility to disease in men and women|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=March 2006|volume=27|issue=2|pages=131–144|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.06.001|url=http://facelab.org/bcjones/Teaching/files/Thornhill_2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preference for masculine faces is only recorded in short-term mate choices. It is therefore suggested that females are attracted to masculine faces only during [[ovulation]] as masculinity reflects a high level of fitness, used to ensure reproductive success. Whilst such preferences may be of lesser importance today, the evolutionary explanation offers reasoning as to why such effects are recorded.

As well as masculinity, females are more sensitive to the scent of males who display high levels of developmental stability.&lt;ref name="Gangestad1998"/&gt; An individual's developmental stability is a measurement of fluctuating asymmetry, defined as their level of deviation from perfect bilateral symmetry. In a comparison of female college students, the results indicated that those normally cycling were more receptive to the scent of shirts worn by symmetrical men when nearing peak fertility in their ovulatory cycle. The same women reported no such preference for the scent of symmetrical men when re-tested during non-fertile stages of the menstrual cycle. Those using the [[Oral contraceptive pill|contraceptive pill]], and therefore not following regular cyclical patterns, reported no such preference.&lt;ref name="Gangestad1998"/&gt;

As with masculine faces, the ability to determine symmetry via scent was likely designed by [[natural selection]] to increase the probability of reproductive success through mating with a male offering strong [[genetics]]. This is evidenced in research focusing on traits of symmetrical males, who consistently record higher levels of IQ, coordination, social dominance, and consequently, greater reproductive fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Dongen|first1=Stefan|last2=Gangestad|first2=Steven W.|title=Human fluctuating asymmetry in relation to health and quality: a meta-analysis|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=November 2011|volume=32|issue=6|pages=380–398|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2011.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pound|first1=N.|last2=Lawson|first2=D. W.|last3=Toma|first3=A. M.|last4=Richmond|first4=S.|last5=Zhurov|first5=A. I.|last6=Penton-Voak|first6=I. S.|title=Facial fluctuating asymmetry is not associated with childhood ill-health in a large British cohort study|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=13 August 2014|volume=281|issue=1792|pages=20141639–20141639|doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.1639|pmid=25122232|pmc=4150332}}&lt;/ref&gt; As symmetry appears to reflect an abundance of desirable traits held by the male in question, it is self-evident that such males are more desirable to females who are seeking high quality mates. In such, during ovulation, females show a strong preference for symmetrical males as they are reaching peak fertility. As it would be advantageous for asymmetrical men to release a scent similar to that produced by symmetrical males, the female signal used to detect symmetry is presumed to be an honest one (asymmetrical males cannot fake it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zahavi|first1=Amotz|title=Mate selection—A selection for a handicap|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=September 1975|volume=53|issue=1|pages=205–214|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3|pmid=1195756|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21959410_Mate_Selection-A_Selection_for_a_Handicap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this, females have different behavioural preferences towards men during stages in their cycles. It has been found that women have a preference towards more masculine voices during the late-follicular, fertile phase of the menstrual cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feinberg|first=D. R|last2=Jones|first2=B. C.|last3=Law Smith|first3=M. J.|last4=Moore|first4=F. R.|last5=DeBruine|first5=L. M.|last6=Cornwell|first6=R. E.|last7=Hillier|first7=S. G.|last8=Perrett|first8=D. I.|date=2006-02-01|title=Menstrual cycle, trait estrogen level, and masculinity preferences in the human voice|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X05001704|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=49|issue=2|pages=215–222|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2005.07.004|pmid=16055126}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are particularly sensitive towards [[voice pitch]] and apparent [[Vocal tract|vocal-tract]] length, which are [[testosterone]]-related traits. This effect has been found to be most significant in women who are less feminine (those with low E3G levels), in comparison to women with higher E3G levels. It has been suggested that this difference in preference is because feminine women (those with high E3G levels) are more successful at obtaining investment. It is not necessary for these women to change their mating preferences during their cycles. More masculine women may make these changes to enhance their chances of achieving investment.

Women have been found to report greater sexual attraction to men other than their own partners when near ovulation compared with the luteal phase. Women whose partners have high developmental stability have greater attraction to men other than their partners when fertile. This can be interpreted as women possessing an adaptation to be attracted to men possessing markers of genetic fitness, therefore sexual attraction depends on the qualities of her partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gangestad |first1=S.

===Ovulation and ornamentation===

Hormone levels throughout the menstrual cycle affect a woman's behaviour in preferences and in their overt behaviours. The [[Biological ornament|ornamentation]] effect is a phenomenon influenced by a stage of the menstrual cycle which refers to the way a woman presents herself to others, in a way to attract potential sexual partners. Studies have found that the closer women were to [[Ovulation cycle|ovulation]], the more provocatively they dress and the more attractive they are rated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haselton|first=Martie G.|last2=Mortezaie|first2=Mina|last3=Pillsworth|first3=Elizabeth G.|last4=Bleske-Rechek|first4=April|last5=Frederick|first5=David A.|date=2007-01-01|title=Ovulatory shifts in human female ornamentation: Near ovulation, women dress to impress|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X06002509|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=51|issue=1|pages=40–45|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.07.007|pmid=17045994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the function in animals, it is probable that this ornamentation is to attract potential partners and that a woman's motivations may vary across her cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bullivant|first=Susan B.|last2=Sellergren|first2=Sarah A.|last3=Stern|first3=Kathleen|last4=Spencer|first4=Natasha A.|last5=Jacob|first5=Suma|last6=Mennella|first6=Julie A.|last7=McClintock|first7=Martha K.|date=2004-02-01|title=Women's sexual experience during the menstrual cycle: identification of the sexual phase by noninvasive measurement of luteinizing hormone|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=41|issue=1|pages=82–93|doi=10.1080/00224490409552216|issn=0022-4499|pmid=15216427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into this relationship has discovered that women who were to attend a [[Nightclub|discothèque]] and rated their clothing as 'sexy' and 'bold,' also stated that their intention for the evening was to flirt and find a partner to go home with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grammer|first=Karl|last2=Renninger|first2=LeeAnn|last3=Fischer|first3=Bettina|date=2004-02-01|title=Disco clothing, female sexual motivation, and relationship status: is she dressed to impress?|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=41|issue=1|pages=66–74|doi=10.1080/00224490409552214|issn=0022-4499|pmid=15216425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although direct causation cannot be stated, this research suggests that there is a direct link between a woman's ornamentation and her motivation to attract mates.

It is possible that women are sensitive to the changes in their physical attractiveness throughout their cycles, such that at their most fertile stages their levels of attractiveness are increased. Consequently, they choose to display their increased levels of attractiveness through this method of ornamentation.&lt;ref name="Haselton 509–518"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haselton|first=Martie G.|last2=Gangestad|first2=Steven W.|date=2006-04-01|title=Conditional expression of women's desires and men's mate guarding across the ovulatory cycle|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=49|issue=4|pages=509–518|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2005.10.006|issn=0018-506X|pmid=16403409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During periods of hormonal imbalance, women exhibit a peak in sexual activity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = D. B. | last2 = Gold | first2 = A. R. | last3 = Burt | first3 = B.

Research has also found that menstrual cycles affect sexual behaviour frequency in pre-[[menopausal]] women. For example, women who had weekly sexual intercourse with men had menstrual cycles with the average duration of 29 days, while women with less frequent sexual interactions tended to have more extreme cycle lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cutler|first1=Winnifred, B.|last2=Garcia|first2=Celso, R.|last3=Freiger|first3=Abba|title=Sexual Behaviour Frequency and menstrual cycle length in mature premenopausal women|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|date=December 1978|volume=4|issue=4|pages=297–309|pmid=523588|doi=10.1016/0306-4530(79)90014-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male response to ovulation===
Changes in hormones during a female's cycles affect the way she behaves and the way males behave towards her. Research has found that men are a lot more attentive and loving towards their partners when they are in the most [[Fertility|fertile]] phase of their cycles, in comparison to when they are in the [[luteal]] phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pillsworth|first=Elizabeth G.|last2=Haselton|first2=Martie G.|date=2006-07-01|title=Male sexual attractiveness predicts differential ovulatory shifts in female extra-pair attraction and male mate retention|url=http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(05)00093-0/abstract|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|language=English|volume=27|issue=4|pages=247–258|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.10.002|issn=1090-5138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men become increasingly [[Sexual jealousy|jealous and possessive]] over their partners during this stage.&lt;ref name="Gangestad 975–982"/&gt; It is highly likely that these changes in male behaviour is a result of the female partner's increased desire to seek and flirt with other males. Therefore, these behavioural [[adaptation]]s have developed as a form of [[mate guarding]], which increases the male's likelihood of maintaining the relationship and increasing chances of reproductive success.

'''''Sky and Water I''''' is a [[woodcut]] print by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[M. C. Escher]] first printed in June 1938.

The basis of this print is a regular division of the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] consisting of [[birds]] and [[fish]]. Both prints have the  [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] series of these [[elements of art|elements]]—fitting into each other like the pieces of a [[jigsaw puzzle]]—in the middle, transitional portion of the prints. In this central layer the pictorial elements are equal: birds and fish are alternately foreground or background, depending on whether the eye concentrates on light or dark elements. The birds take on an increasing [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensionality]] in the upward direction, and the fish, in the downward direction. But as the fish progress upward and the birds downward they gradually lose their shapes to become a uniform background of sky and water, respectively.

According to Escher: "In the horizontal center strip there are birds and fish equivalent to each other. We associate flying with sky, and so for each of the black birds the sky in which it is flying is formed by the four white fish which encircle it. Similarly swimming makes us think of water, and therefore the four black birds that surround a fish become the water in which it swims."

This print has been used in [[physics]], [[geology]], [[chemistry]], and in [[psychology]] for the study of [[visual perception]]. In the pictures a number of [[visual]] elements unite into a simple visual representation, but separately each forms a point of departure for the elucidation of a [[theory]] in one of these disciplines.

M.C Escher, ''Sky and Water I'' best exemplify figure ground-reversal.

'''''Suffer little children to come unto me''''' is a painting attributed to the Dutch painter [[Rembrandt]]. The subject of the portrait is the [[teaching of Jesus about little children]] and it is estimated that Rembrandt painted it in Leiden in the 1620s.&lt;ref name=Volkskrant&gt;[https://www.volkskrant.nl/cultuur-media/kunsthandelaar-jan-six-ontdekt-weer-een-nieuwe-rembrandt~b7ca0af1/ Art dealer Jan Six discovers another Rembrandt] in the Volkskrant, 14 september 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rembrandt Lempertz-1029-1174-Old-Masters-and-19th-Century-Netherlandish-School-mid-17th-century-Let-the-Little-Children-C 8e28048ba4.jpg|thumb|The painting as it looked in 2014 before restoration activities began]]
The painting was recently discovered by Dutch art dealer Jan Six. He is a direct descendant of [[Jan Six]], a 17th-century burgher who sat for one of Rembrandt’s most important paintings, ''[[Portrait of Jan Six]]''. He asked an invester to buy it at Lempertz auction for €1,525,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artkurio.com/blog/2014/05/21/rembrandt-discovery-at-auction Netherlandish School, "Let the Little Children Come to Me"], oil on canvas, 122 x 104 cm Sold for €1,525,000 at Lempertz, Lot 1174, on 17th of May 2014 Estimate: 15,000 - 18,000 Euro&lt;/ref&gt;

Six recently reattributed another painting to Rembrandt, ''[[Portrait of a Young Gentleman]]''. This painting, which he discovered earlier, is dated to the 1620s and grouped under the growing list of paintings in Rembrandt's oeuvre known as his "juvenalia". It was kept secret pending investigation and restoration and was meant to be announced and introduced to the public at the opening of a Rembrandt exhibition at the [[Museum De Lakenhal]] in Leiden, scheduled to open 1 November 2019, but rumors prevented insiders from keeping it secret.&lt;ref name=Volkskrant/&gt; The painting had previously been known and rejected by experts, though all were in agreement as to the large amount of overpainting and it was during removal of this overpaint that convincing details were revealed such as the color purple used for clothing. The subject and arrangement of figures was inspired by a 1619 work by [[Pieter Lastman]] (formerly in Frederiksborg, lost in 1859 fire) and later formed the inspiration for another work previously attributed to Rembrandt and now listed as circa 1652 by his pupil [[Nicolaes Maes]]:
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The painting includes a selfportrait of the young Rembrandt, a portrait of his mother, and other motifs known through his history paintings:

'''Superimposition''' is the placement of one thing over another, typically so that both are still evident.

==Graphics==
In [[graphics]], superimposition is the placement of an [[image]] or video on top of an already-existing image or video, usually to add to the overall image effect, but also sometimes to conceal something (such as when a different face is superimposed over the original face in a [[photograph]]). 

==Cartography==
This technique is used in [[cartography]] to produce [[photomapping|photomaps]] by superimposing grid lines, [[contour line]]s and other linear or textual mapping features over [[aerial photograph]]s.

==2D images==
Superimposition of two-dimensional images containing correlated periodic grid structures may produce [[moiré pattern]]s. Superimposition of two correlated layers comprising parallel lines or curves may give rise [[line moiré]] patterns. The movement of one of the layers results in a faster movement of the line moiré superimposition image. Such optical acceleration is known as [[moiré speedup]] (check for the formulas of optical speedup for curved patterns). When superimposing two identical layers comprising randomly spaced parallel lines, at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random line moiré patterns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://switzernet.com/people/emin-gabrielyan/070227-random-line-moire |title=Aperiodic random line moiré |website=Switzernet.com |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely line Glass patterns (after [[Leon Glass]], 1969) appear. Similarly, when superimposing two identical layers of randomly scattered dots at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random dot Glass patterns, namely random dot moiré,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://switzernet.com/people/emin-gabrielyan/070212-random-moire |title=Examples of random moiré |website=Switzernet.com |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; appears. When one of the layers embeds complex shapes, such as sequences of symbols forming a text, and another layer contains parallel lines or curves, the superimposition image may give rise to magnified shapes, called [[shape moiré]] patterns.

==Audio==
Superimposition (SI) during sound recording and reproduction (commonly called [[overdubbing]]) is the process of adding new sounds over existing without completely erasing or masking the existing sound. Some [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorders]] of the mid 20th century provided crude superimposition facilities that were implemented by killing the high-frequency AC feed to the erase head while recording as normal via the read-write head.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5335">'''Symphony No. 3''' is an [[orchestra]]l composition in two movements by the American composer [[Christopher Rouse (composer)|Christopher Rouse]].  The work was jointly commissioned by the [[St. Louis Symphony]], the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra]], and the [[Singapore Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun"&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Tim |authorlink=Tim Smith (journalist) |title=BSO gives East Coast premiere of sensational symphony by Christopher Rouse |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=November 9, 2012 |url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/classicalmusic/2012/11/bso_gives_east_coast_premiere.html |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was completed February 3, 2011 and premiered May 5, 2011 by the Saint Louis Symphony under [[David Robertson (conductor)|David Robertson]] at [[Powell Hall]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;[[Christopher Rouse (composer)|Rouse, Christopher]].

==Composition==
Rouse conceived the Symphony No. 3 as a reworking of [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Symphony No. 2 (Prokofiev)|Symphony No. 2 in D minor]] (itself a homage to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)|final Piano Sonata]]), though there are relatively few musical quotes from the work.&lt;ref name="KWMU"&gt;{{cite web |last=Edwards |first=Mary |title=St. Louis Symphony Extra - an interview with Christopher Rouse |work=[[KWMU]] |date=May 11, 2011 |url=http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/st-louis-symphony-extra-interview-christopher-rouse |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, as Rouse wrote in the program notes, he used the "unusual form of Prokofiev's Symphony No. 2" to "[furnish] the old bottle into which I have tried to pour new wine."&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;  The symphony has a duration of approximately 25 minutes and is composed in two movements; the first is a "savage and aggressive" homage to the symphony of "iron and steel" and the second is a theme with five variations.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KWMU" /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The symphony is scored for [[piccolo]], two [[Western concert flute|flutes]], two [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], two [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn]]s, four [[trumpet]]s, four [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], two [[Pedal harp|harps]], [[timpani]], percussion (three players), and [[String section|strings]] ([[violin]]s I &amp; II, [[viola]]s, [[violoncello]]s, and [[double bass]]es).&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
[[Tim Smith (journalist)|Tim Smith]] of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' said the work built up "startling energy" and added that it "makes a substantial addition to the orchestral repertoire. It leaves you almost reeling — in a good way — from an assault on the senses."&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun" /&gt;  Reviewing the world premiere, Chuck Lavazzi of ''[[KDHX]]'' called the symphony "a fiercely challenging work that demands remarkable stamina and skill from every member of the orchestra. In that last respect it reminded me as much of [[Béla Bartók|Bartok]]’s [[Concerto for Orchestra (Bartók)|Concerto for Orchestra]] as it did of the Prokofiev work. An aggressive mix of wild cacophony and surprising lyricism, the piece was clearly not received with enthusiasm by everyone, but my wife and I both found it bracing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lavazzi |first=Chuck |title=Concert review: Rousing Rouse and opulent Orff with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra and Chorus at Powell Hall, Thursday through Sunday, May 5 - 8 |work=[[KDHX]] |date=May 6, 2011 |url=http://kdhx.org/music/reviews/rousing-rouse-and-opulent-orff-with-the-st-louis-symphony-orchestra-and-chorus-at-powell-hall-thursday-through-sunday-may-5-8 |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joshua Kosman of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' similarly described the piece as "a phenomenal score, as vivid and beautiful as anything this composer has ever done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kosman |first=Joshua |title=Cabrillo Fest review: Rouse premiere a revelation |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=August 5, 2013 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Cabrillo-Fest-review-Rouse-premiere-a-revelation-4706090.php |accessdate=May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Book of Other People''''' is a collection of [[short stories]], published in 2008 by [[Penguin Books]]. Selected and edited by [[Zadie Smith]], it contains 23 short stories by 23 different authors, among them [[Nick Hornby]], [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]], [[Colm Tóibín]], [[Jonathan Safran Foer]], [[Dave Eggers]], as well as Smith herself. The collection, as evidenced by the title, focuses on character; the authors were simply asked to "make somebody up".&lt;!--I didn't know how to use a template to cite an editor and a preface.--&gt;&lt;ref name="tboop"&gt;[[Zadie Smith|Smith, Zadie]]. Preface. ''The Book of Other People''. By Zadie Smith, ed. [[New York City]]: [[Penguin Books]], 2008. vii–ix. “''The Book of Other People'' is about character. The instruction was simple: ''make somebody up''.”&lt;/ref&gt; It being a "charity anthology," the contributors to ''The Book of Other People'' were not compensated for their writing, and the book's proceeds were given to [[826NYC]], a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting students with their creative writing skills.&lt;ref name="the-guardian"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/generalfiction/0,,2208906,00.html |title= The joy of brief encounters |accessdate=2008-04-16 |author= |date=11 November 2007 |work= [[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=Alex | last=Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
One of the central requirements for the authors was that each contribution had to bear the character's name as its title.&lt;ref name="tboop"/&gt; Though the editor, Smith, originally wanted each of the characters to have both [[given name|first]] and [[surname|last names]], several of the authors did not include surnames, and that rule was eventually dropped.&lt;ref name="the-guardian"/&gt; Indeed, several of the stories—such as "Puppy," "The Liar," and "The Monster"—do not have true names at all.

==Critical reception==
''The Book of Other People'' was generally well received by critics, who praised the authors' characterization; one wrote, "[they] create satisfying characters as memorable as any in their novels,"&lt;ref name="usa-today"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2008-01-23-other-people-smith_N.htm |title= Imagination takes over 'The Book of Other People |accessdate=2008-04-16 |author=David Daley |date=24 January 2008 |work= [[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another that "[v]ariety&amp;nbsp;... is certainly on display."&lt;ref name="wash-post"/&gt;

Several of the stories were specifically commended, among them Danticat's "Lélé" and Tóibín's "Donal Webster", which were said to "unfold, like elaborate origami flowers, into complex portraits."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/books/08kaku.html |title= One by One, Narratives Reflecting Life’s Mosaic |accessdate=2008-04-16 |author=Michiko Kakutani |date=8 January 2008 |work= [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all were received well—one reviewer wrote that "[o]ther tales in this volume feel overly pat or mechanically perfunctory," and another that "a few of the contributions are bright but empty."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="times-online"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/fiction/article2871427.ece |title= The Book of Other People edited by Zadie Smith |accessdate=2008-04-16 |author=Sophie Harrison |date=18 November 2007| work=[[The Times]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Middle Years''''' is an incomplete book of autobiography by [[Henry James]], posthumously published in 1917. The book covers the early years of James' residence in Europe and his meetings with writers such as [[George Eliot]], [[Alfred Tennyson]], and [[James Russell Lowell]].

==Summary and themes==
The seven chapters of this fragment show promise as a record of James' young manhood in Europe. He met many of the leading writers of the day, though his opinions of them were not always flattering. Tennyson he found rather dull and commonplace, not at all the fine mind he expected. The [[poetry|poet's]] reading of ''Locksley Hall'' left James unimpressed.

George Eliot appealed much more to James with her interesting conversation and alert consideration of ideas. James tells a story of how he helped summon a doctor when George Eliot's injured stepson required urgent medical aid. He compliments the novelist on how carefully she attended to the young man.

James also has much to say about the London of his first impressions: the rooms he stayed in, the Londoners he talked with on the streets, the theaters and museums he visited. The fragment concludes with a remembrance of Lady Waterford, a painter who possessed "that combination of rare beauty and rare talent which the [[Victorian era|Victorian age]] had for many years not ceased to acclaim."

'''''The Rommelpot Player''''' is a painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Frans Hals]], painted in 1618-1620 and now in the [[Kimbell Art Museum]]. It is considered the best of several versions of a [[Rommelpot]] player by Frans Hals.

==Painting ==
Fifteen versions of this painting were documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1910, who wrote:
"The Rommelpot- Player. In the centre is a man turned 
three-quarters left. He faces the spectator and laughs heartily. He is in 
dark clothes with a broad brimmed felt hat. His left forearm encircles 
the rommelpot (or bagpipes) ; in his right hand is a little stick with which 
he plays on it. Six laughing children surround him. The biggest boy, 
behind him to the right, claps his hands with delight. The other five 
children are to the left. Four of them are placed so that their heads make 
a diagonal line down to the left. The second boy from the top has a 
slouch hat. The fifth child, a girl, stands to the left behind this boy. In 
the background peasants look in at a door. 

Variants of this composition exist. Thus, the girl on the extreme left 
looks at the spectator and not up at the player in the picture of the Paul 
Giersberg sale. Another time, the girl is replaced by a boy who looks up 
at the player in the picture of the Paul Mersch sale while the second 
child from the bottom, a little girl, who usually looks up at the player, is 
facing the spectator. 

A recognised original of this composition cannot now be traced. There 
are a number of replicas which at best date from the time of Frans Hals, 
while some perhaps come from his studio. As the figures are of life size 
in several replicas, it is to be inferred that the original was also of life size. 

The rommelpot-player alone as a half-length figures in a picture in the 
Hamburg Kunsthalle ; signed in Gothic letters, "Fhals"; panel, 10 inches 
by 9 inches; acquired with the Hudtwalker-Wesselhoeft collection, 1888; 
reproduced in Bode's work on the Wesselhoeft collection. 

The chief replicas of the whole composition are : 

# In the collection of Carl von Hollitscher, Berlin ; panel, 19 1/2 inches by 15 inches; exhibited at Berlin, 1890, No. 82; here the girl looks at the spectator. 
# In the Holscher-Stumpf collection, Berlin; canvas, 26 1/2 inches by 19 1/2 inches ; here the second child from the bottom looks at the spectator. 
# In the Amalienstift, Dessau, 1877 catalogue, No. 109; panel. 
# (B. 96). In the collection of Herr Goldschmidt, junior, Frankfort-on-Main ; panel, 15 1/2 inches by 12 1/2 inches ; in the sales : Gsell, Vienna, March 14, 1872, No. 38; and Schorer, Groot Bentveld, April 26, 1892, No. 32 (6000 florins, Goedhart). 
# In the collection of Sir F. Cook, Bart., Richmond ; canvas, 47 inches by 32 1/2 inches ; exhibited at the Guildhall, London, 1903, No. 173 ; here the girl looks at the spectator. 
# (B. 154). In the collection of the Earl of Pembroke, Wilton House, No. 29 ; here the girl looks at the spectator. 
# Mentioned in the inventory of the goods of J. van de Cappelle, dated January 4, 1680 ; see Oud Holland, x. 34, No. 99. 
# In the sale : H. van der Vugt, Amsterdam, April 27, 1745 (Hoet, n. 164), No. 103 or No. 104 in the original catalogue (55 florins, Pieter Yver), measuring 43 inches by 30 inches. 
# In the sales : Madame Lenglier, Paris, March 10, 1788 (370 francs) ; Destouches, Paris, March 21, 1794 ; panel, 21 1/2 inches by 17 inches. Engraved by Hubert in the Galerie Lebrun. The engraver has erred with the hands of the figure on the right behind the player. In the picture the boy strikes his right fist into his open left hand. In the print the hands become a confused knot of folds. Here the girl looks at the player. 
# "A Merry Rommelpot-Player and two Laughing Children." This was in the sales : P. M. Kesler, C. Apostool, and others, Amsterdam, May 13, 1844, No. 37 (50 florins, Roos) ; and J. A. A. de Lelie and others, Amsterdam, July 29, 1845, No. 78. 
# In the sale : J. van der Veen, Amsterdam, April 14, 1851, No. 112. 
# (B. 27). In the sale : Neville D. Goldsmid of The Hague, Paris, May 4, 1876, No. 43 measuring 40 inches by 32 inches. It came from the Tholen collection, Emden. 
# (B. 61 ; M. 223). In the sales: Count Mniszech, Paris, April 9, 1902, No. 126 (35,000 francs); and H. J. A. Eyre and others, London, December 9, 1905, No. 59 measuring 40 inches by 33 inches. Here the girl looks at the player. 
# In the sale : Paul Giersberg of Wesel, Cologne, April 16, 1907 No. 33. Here the girl looks at the spectator. 
# In the sale : Paul Mersch, Paris, May 8, 1908, No. 39. Here there are only five children ; the second from the bottom, a girl, looks at the spectator.

The '''Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990''' ('''VARA'''), {{UnitedStatesCode|17|106A}}, is a [[United States]] law granting certain rights to artists.

VARA was the first federal [[United States Copyright law|copyright]] legislation to grant protection to ''[[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]]''. Under VARA, works of art that meet certain requirements afford their authors additional rights in the works, regardless of any subsequent physical ownership of the work itself, or regardless of who holds the copyright to the work. For instance, a painter may insist on proper attribution of his painting, and in some instances may sue the owner of the physical painting for destroying the painting even if the owner of the painting lawfully owned it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703447004575449793518169052|title=When Creator and Owner Clash|first=Daniel|last=Grant|date=31 August 2010|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although federal law had not acknowledged moral rights before this act, some state legislatures and judicial decisions created limited moral-rights protection. The [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] required the protection of these rights by signatory states, and it was in response that the U.S. Congress passed the VARA.

==Exclusive rights under VARA==
VARA exclusively grants authors of works that fall under the protection of the Act the following rights
*right to claim authorship
*right to prevent the use of one's name on any work the author did not create
*right to prevent use of one's name on any work that has been distorted, mutilated, or modified in a way that would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation
*right to prevent distortion, mutilation, or modification that would prejudice the author's honor or reputation

Additionally, authors of works of "recognized stature" may prohibit intentional or grossly negligent destruction of a work. Exceptions to VARA require a waiver from the author in writing. To date, "recognized stature" has managed to elude a precise definition. VARA allows authors to waive their rights, something generally not permitted in France and many European countries whose laws were the originators of the moral rights of artists concept.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Sherman. Note: THE VISUAL ARTISTS RIGHTS ACT OF 1990: AMERICAN ARTISTS BURNED AGAIN. 17 Cardozo L. Rev. 373 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In most instances, the rights granted under VARA persist for the life of the author (or the last surviving author, for creators of joint works).

===Covered works===
VARA provides its protection only to [[paintings]], [[drawings]], [[Printmaking|prints]], [[sculptures]], [[Photograph|still photographic images]] produced for exhibition only, and existing in single copies or in limited editions of 200 or fewer copies, signed and numbered by the artist. The requirements for protection do not implicate aesthetic taste or value.

==Application and effect==
VARA's application is limited to visual works that fall within a narrowly defined category. However, for works that do fall within the category of protected works, VARA imposes substantial restrictions on any modification or removal of those works. Purchasers of the works must obtain written waivers from the author if they wish to exercise any of the exclusive rights under VARA.

This has particularly been an issue for those that commission public sculptures. Absent a waiver, artists could effectively veto decisions to remove their structures from their benefactor's land. In a 2006 decision involving public sculptures that were removed from the park for which they were created, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] ruled that VARA does not protect location as a component of site-specific work.  VARA covered works can be moved as long as the move does not constitute "destruction, distortion, or mutilation."&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc.'', 459 F.3d 128 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|1st Circuit]] 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of works==
*[[Tilted Arc]], a well-known artwork by [[Richard Serra]], was removed from public display prior to the enactment of VARA.
*[[Kent Twitchell]]'s [[Ed Ruscha]] [[mural]] was painted over without his approval.  Twitchell agreed to the largest settlement ever under VARA for $1.1 million against the U.S. government and 12 defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/13/us/5pointz-graffiti-artists-award-trnd/index.html|title=Judge awards $6.7 million to graffiti artists whose work was destroyed to build condos|last=CNN|first=Laura Ly,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/06/27/417204222/what-right-do-muralists-have-to-the-buildings-they-paint-on|title=What Right Do Muralists Have To The Buildings They Paint On?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On February 12, 2018, a federal judge cited VARA in awarding $6.7 million to 21 graffiti artists at the [[5 Pointz]] open-air graffiti museum whose works were destroyed by the developer who owned the property on which the graffiti had been painted. The building owner tore the building down to rebuild condos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/nyregion/5pointz-graffiti-judgment.html|title=Graffiti Artists Awarded $6.7 Million for Destroyed 5Pointz Murals|last=Feuer|first=Alan|date=2018-02-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/nyregion/5pointz-graffiti-jury.html|title=Brooklyn Jury Finds 5Pointz Developer Illegally Destroyed Graffiti|last=Feuer|first=Alan|date=2017-11-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/426658/judge-rules-developer-must-pay-5pointz-graffiti-artists-6-7m/|title=Judge Rules Developer Must Pay 5Pointz Graffiti Artists $6.7M|date=2018-02-12|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
