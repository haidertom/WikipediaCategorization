      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21025">'''Agroscope''' is the Swiss Confederation’s centre of excellence for agricultural research, and is affiliated with the Federal Office for Agriculture, which in turn is subordinate to the [[Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research]]. Agroscope makes an important contribution to a sustainable agriculture and food sector as well as to an intact environment, thereby contributing to an improved quality of life.

== Goals ==

Agroscope researches along the entire value chain of the agriculture and food sector. Its aims are a competitive and multifunctional agricultural sector, high-quality food for a healthy diet, and an intact environment. The Research Station gears its work to the needs of the recipients of its services.

== History ==

'''History until 1850'''

The importance in many regions of the Swiss Plateau was dominated for centuries by the three-field technique. This three-span rotation was divided as follows:

**1st Year: Winter wheat
**2nd Year: Summer grain (usually oats or barley)
**3rd Year: fallow

In each field possessed the farmer his individual acre. It was not a working association of farmers, but of a village community. The three-field did not let an intensive livestock. The common grazing on the fallow, the unfertilized Allmend and the stubble fields, and the lack of winter feeding offered only a meager food. For centuries, forest trees were debranched for winter feed. Agriculture froze in the three-field.

For agriculture, the 18th Century, means the dawn of a new, better era. Young country gentlemen took the management of their estates into their own hands and sought to agriculture, especially livestock raising and promote. The chains of the three-field  technique were broken. They began with the stall-feeding, careful storage of manure, and built on the former fields potatoes and clover. The common land was parceled out and divided among the peasants. A new goal came to the fore, namely, to keep enough cattle to supply their own country with enough manure. In the midst of these developments, the French Revolution broke out. The world was open for innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:13-15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''First stations for education an controlling (1850–1880)'''

During the second half of the 19th century, humans had to adapt to the requirements of an industrialized community. Completely new technologies changed their lives and natural sciences offered completely different explanations for life procedures and agricultural production than before.

In the 19th century Switzerland therefore starts to install local agricultural institutes. With the new Federal Constitution of 1848 the modern welfare state begins to develop. In the Fifties the first, however very modest [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] were paid to farmers.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lehmann, Josef 2003:19-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Till the middle of the 19th century people had to cultivate their bread grain by themselves. For the authorities, the major task of agriculture was the self-sufficiency of states with grain. Only until 1860, larger quantities of grain were imported from the Danube countries and from overseas.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lehmann, Josef 2003:27&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The birth of the research stations (1874–1914)'''

The Federal Government's first step towards agricultural research stations was the development of ETH Zurich, where the first two federal agricultural experimental stations were established in 1878: the Swiss Federal Seed Control Station and the Swiss Federal Agricultural Chemistry Experimental Station. Both stations grew very quickly. The Seed Control Station in particular developed into a world-renowned institute. Its founder, Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler led it expertly and successfully for 42 years. The topics studied included fertilisers and feedstuffs, soils, milk, wines, farm fertilisers etc.. A focal point was the further development of analysis methods.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lehmann, Josef 2003:29&lt;/ref&gt; This provided the starting point for the subsequent founding of the Reckenholz location of the present-day Agroscope Reckenholz-Tänikon Research Station (ART). However, the second location, Tänikon TG, was only opened in 1970, at that time as a research station for rural economics and agricultural engineering.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Popp, Hans 2001:4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th century, the vines of West Switzerland were devastated by disease. This marked the establishment of the Vaud Vine Research Station in 1886 and ultimately also the Swiss Federal Research Station in Changins, which resulted from the amalgamation of the Swiss Federal Research Station for Agricultural Chemistry (founded in 1886), the Swiss Federal Seed Control Laboratory (founded in 1898) and the Swiss Federal Vine Research Station (founded in 1915). The Experimental Station for Fruit Production, Viticulture and Horticulture in Wädenswil had already existed since 1890. The Federal Government took over this station in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Popp, Hans 2001:4-5&lt;/ref&gt;  These two locations, Changins and Wädenswil, merged more than a hundred years later to form the Agroscope Changins-Wädenswil Research Station (ACW).

At the end of the 19th century the Federal Government built a new experimental station, including a vegetation building and an experimental cheese dairy, in Liebefeld, Bern. The buildings became operational in 1901. Liebefeld thus became the location for the following three stations: the "Experimental Station for Agricultural Chemistry", the "Swiss Dairy Farming Experimental Station" and the estate farm for permits for the sale of agricultural supplies with head office.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Popp, Hans 2001:4-5&lt;/ref&gt; This head office of the Swiss agricultural experimental and test stations resulted in the Farm Animal Research Station. It moved its location to Posieux FR in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Sieber, Robert; Rüegg, Max 2002:5&lt;/ref&gt;  The Liebefeld and Posieux locations merged exactly one hundred years after their foundation to form the Agroscope Liebefeld-Posieux Research Station (ALP).

In 1874 the Federal Government decided to build the Federal Foal Centre in Thun for breeding Freiberger stallions. In 1927 ten mares were added, and the foal centre became the Swiss Federal Stud. Since 1998 it has been called the Swiss National Stud. Since 2009 it has belonged to the ALP-Haras unit, together with Agroscope Liebefeld-Posieux (ALP).&lt;ref&gt;cf. Website Agroscope: Gestüt&lt;/ref&gt;

This laid the foundation for Agroscope's present three agricultural research stations.

'''First World War (1914–1918)'''
 
As on 1 August 1914 the First World War broke out, Switzerland was totally unprepared: inadequate food production in their own country and the supplies from the country interrupted. Switzerland imported at that time about 85% of the cereal demand.

These bottlenecks particularly in the food supply during the First World War broke out in agricultural research, big changes. The priorities of research, more and more placed on agriculture and issues of grassland and livestock took place in the background.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:37-39&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Between the World Wars (1919–1938) '''

After the end of World War  people wanted as soon as possible  return to a free market. This had disastrous consequences for agriculture. During the First World War, the prices of agricultural commodities were increased significantly, later collapsed brutally.

The importance of cereal crops for food security had been detected and forget the bad experiences at the beginning of World War II. Thus, the Federal Council tried shortly after the war to domestic cereal production by an import monopoly, combined with the acquisition of the domestic crop at a guaranteed price to support and protect against the fluctuations of the global market.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1920 the two  research stations "Swiss seed Investigation and Research" and "Swiss agricultural chemistry research institution" were combined. As of this date was also the new name: Swiss Federal Agricultural Research Institute Zurich – Oerlikon (ELVA).&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:53&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Second World War (1939–1945)'''
 
In an effort to learn from past mistakes and, if possible not to repeat them, people responded pretty quickly, as the political events of the situation in Europe got worse more and more. In time the war preventions measures were initiated. At the beginning of World War I all wartime measures were taken from case to case out of nothing and had to be put out, one was prepared when the war began in 1939 in various relationships significantly better.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of war, the Laboratory provided primarily in the service of the adaptation and reproduction of the agricultural production. End of September 1943, the federal government acquired the good Reckenholz on the northern border of  Zurich-Affoltern.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:70-71&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Post-war years and the impact of the growing battle (1946–1960)'''

Thanks to the American Marshall Plan enormous sums of money flowed into the western Europe. This allowed the so-called "post-war economic miracle." The two to three decades after the  war are known as an increasing time of euphoria and increased modernization.  Agriculture also was included in an unprecedented structural change, her face changed dramatically.

In 1947, the force during the war price controls lifted and the free competition replaced the official price control again.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:83-85&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Time since 1960'''
 
The Farm Act of 1951 underlined the idea that you can avoid by a generous promotion of agriculture, the overproduction of meat and milk,  but proved to be deceptive. The situation, particularly in the dairy industry, coined the debates and actions of the agricultural policy in those years. In the European Community (EC) was the overproduction a big problem.

During this period, they put the focus of research attention to the development of friendly production methods and improving the quality of the crop.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:101-102&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New concepts in agricultural politics (since 1996)'''

The major problems with the current agricultural policy and the changing values of society in terms of environmental awareness and quality of life called urgently for new approaches in the agricultural policy. On 1 January 1 1999, the new farm bill with the main objectives "more market, more ecology” was put into force. It had become clear that the company long term  was only an environmentally friendly, animal-friendly and tolerant of sustainability-oriented mode of production. The target was clear: a comprehensive, environmentally sound and resource efficient land management, which complies with the care and preservation of our cultural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

A milestone to this is the so-called Integrated Production (IP). On the basis of different research and development projects at the Agroscope Changins-Wädenswil Research Station ACW in the Seventies and Sixties the Integrated Plant Protection – and further on the Integrated Production for Switzerland – was introduced, taking into account integrated pest control. Today, IP in Switzerland equals very often the production after the so-called ÖLN (“ecological performance record”) or SUISSE GARANTIE.

Regarding to a constantly growing world population and a threatening climate change the agricultural research has big challenges to overcome. The Agroscope research for agriculture, nutrition and environment is therefore an investment into our future.

== Famous People ==
'''Jakob Gujer (1716–1785)'''

A simple farmer who came as Kleinjogg from Kazereutihoff to great fame, and so was he probably the most famous Swiss farmer. {{ill|Jakob Gujer|de}} alias "Chlyjogg" became famous by the Zurich city doctor Hans Caspar Hirzel, who published, in 1761, a small book called the "Economy of a peasant philosopher". Chlyjogg was born in 1716 in Wermatswil, where inherited a farm, that managed with great success by new methods devised by him. 1769 he took over the domain “Katzenrütti” near the Reckenholz yards. 
The farm consisted of approximately 68 acres and meadows . Chlyjogg continued testing the methods invented in Wermatswil. 
He tested the application of gypsum and began to stall-feeding, to get more manure. Many important personalities such as Goethe and Duke Karl August of Weimar, visited the Katzenrüttihof. Other famous contemporaries such as Rousseau and Pestalozzi have acknowledged the successful of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler (1842–1935)'''

*Founder of the first Swiss seed and Laboratory Investigation
[[Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler]] was born on 11 August in Safnern, in the Bernese Seeland, as the son of a farmer. In 1870 he joined the agricultural school Rütti. In 1875, he graduated as Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Leipzig. Later he founded a private seed control station in the Mattenhof in Bern. In 1876, he moved to Zurich in order to habilitated in the agricultural department of the Polytechnic. Under Stebler leadership, the seed control station also developed for the international seed trade recognized as a leading institution. 1889 to 1916 he headed the editorial board of the Swiss agricultural newspaper "The Green". On June 3, 1903, he was made an honorary member of the Highland Agricultural Society of Scotland in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernst August Grete (1848–1919)'''

*Member of the Board of Directors of the first Swiss agricultural chemistry research station
Ernst August Grete was born 29 September 1848 in Celle (Hannover). He devoted himself to the university in Göttingen to the study of classical philology and later moved into the educational seminar. After his philological studies, he joined the scientific side. In 1878 he was manager of the chemical test station at the agricultural department of the Federal Polytechnic in Zurich. There he worked for more than 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:35&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermann Müller-Thurgau (1850–1927)'''

*The first director of Wädenswil and father of the world's first scientifically-based new vine breed
[[Hermann Müller (Thurgau)|Hermann Müller]] was born in Tägerwilen on Lake Constance. He studied natural sciences at ETH Zurich. In 1874 he was awarded a PhD in Würzburg, Germany, and later became director of the Institute for Plant Physiology at the Geisenheim Research Station, Germany. In 1890 he became the first director of Wädenswil, the present-day Agroscope Changins-Wädenswil Research Station (ACW), and was a pioneer in the field of vine cultivation. He is considered the father of the Müller-Thurgau vine, which was crossed in 1882 and is the world's first scientifically-based new vine breed. With its success it displaced the old varieties, such as Elbling and Räuschling, and up until today has remained the most successful specifically cultivated vine variety: More than 41,000 ha are cultivated worldwide, which corresponds to almost three times the total vine area of Switzerland. It is most widespread in Germany; in German-speaking Switzerland it is still the most important white wine variety today. For a long time this vine variety was thought to be a crossing between Riesling and Silvaner. In 1998 an Austrian research team discovered, on the basis of molecular-genetic tests, that the crossing partners were not Riesling x Silvaner, but Riesling x Madeleine Royal. How this «mix-up» could have occurred has never been discovered. However, this fact has given new impetus to the vine variety's second name, Müller-Thurgau.

'''Albert Volkart (1873–1951)'''

*First Director of the Swiss agricultural experimental station Zurich-Oerlikon
*The great pioneer of Swiss agriculture {{ill|Albert Volkart|de}} , was born in 1873 in Zurich. In 1891 he began his studies at the agricultural department of the Polytechnic in Zurich. After the final examination in 1894, he joined as an assistant to Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler in this institution, where he was later an assistant and management board, where he worked for 35 years. Volkart dealt extensively with issues of plant protection. In 1917, Volkart replaced the retired CEO of Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler seeds Investigation and Research, and three years later, he became head of the Swiss agricultural experimental station Zurich-Oerlikon. In 1925 he became professor of Agronomy at the ETH.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich Traugott Wahlen (1899–1985)'''

*Director of the Federal Agricultural Research Institute Zurich-Oerlikon
[[Friedrich Traugott Wahlen]] was born in 1899 in Gmeis Mirchel in the Emmental. As a small child he wanted to be a farmer. In 1917 he began his study of agriculture at the Polytechnic in Zurich. He acted in several roles:

**1929-1943: Executive Board of the Swiss agricultural experimental station Zurich-Oerlikon
**1938-1945: Member in the Federal War Food Office
**1942-1949: Council of the Canton of Zurich
**1943-1949: Professor of Agronomy at the agricultural department of the ETH

In 1949 he was appointed to the FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization), first to Washington and then in 1951, to Rome, where he presided as director of the Department of Agriculture from 1950 to 1952 and  was chief of the technical assistance program. In 1958 he was appointed Deputy Director-General of  the FAO. On 11 December 1958, the Federal Assembly elected him to the Federal Council, where he first  was the Minister of Justice and Police, later he led the Ministry of the Department of Economic and then was the Foreign Minister by the Political Department. Until the 1965 elections  he was a Federal Council.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:62-63&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudolf Koblet (1904–1983)'''

*Executive Board of the Swiss Federal Agricultural Research Institute Zurich-Oerlikon
*A polymath of the agricultural crop
On 13 February 1904 {{ill|Rudolf Koblet|de}} was born in Heiterthal, not far from Kollbrunn in Tösstal. He attended the Industrial School in Winterthur and in 1923 began with his studies at the Department of Agriculture of the ETH. In 1926 he graduated with a diploma as an engineer-agronomist. After a stay in France he went to Canada where he acquired, besides the work as "farm help" in various Canadian farms,  specialized knowledge, as a volunteer in the Seed Branch in Ottawa, in the field of control seeds. In 1929 he joined the line for seed control in Oerlikon. With his work "On the germination Pinus strobus with particular reference to the origin of the seed," he earned his doctorate in 1932 Dr.sc.techn. ETH.  In 1949 he became head of the Department of Agronomy at the ETH.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudolf Salzmann (1912–1992)'''

*Director of the Swiss Federal Agricultural Research Station for Agronomy Zurich- Reckenholz
*Planner and builder of the Research Institute Reckenholz
{{ill|Rudolf Salzmann|de}} was born on 2 January 1912 in Bern. In the years 1930 to 1933, he completed his agriculture studies at the ETH. He oversaw the procurement of seed in the war food office under Frederick Traugott elections and then took a slightly later point in agricultural chemistry from the Swiss Federal Institute Liebefeld, where he worked on the agronomic aspects and problems of the institution. In 1944, he was transferred to the agricultural experimental station Oerlikon. His election as successor to Director Koblet took place on November 1, 195, when he took responsibility for both academic work and for the organizational and administrative issues.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:98-99&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''artist's impression''' or '''artist's interpretation''' is the representation of an object or a scene created by an artist, when no other accurate representation is available. It could be an image, a sound, a video or a model. Artist's impressions are often created to represent concepts and objects that cannot be seen by the naked eye; that are very big, very small, in the past, in the future, fictional, or otherwise abstract in other ways. For example, in architecture, artists' impressions are used to showcase the design of planned buildings and associated landscape.&lt;ref name="BobMargaret2004"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Bob Giddings | author2=Margaret Horne | title=Artists' Impressions in Architectural Design | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekhXDjNF2bkC&amp;pg=PA1 | accessdate=24 May 2013 | date=9 March 2004 | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn=978-0-203-36246-4 | pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists' impressions are particularly prominent in [[space art]].&lt;ref name="NASA's Space Art Program"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newatlas.com/how-are-planets-painted/42763/ |title=Artist's Impression: How to Paint a Planet |last=Powell |first=Dominic |date=2016-04-16 |website=New Atlas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Attachment theory''' is a psychological model attempting to describe the dynamics of long-term and short-term [[interpersonal relationship]]s between humans. "Attachment theory is not formulated as a general theory of relationships; it addresses only a specific facet":{{sfn|Waters|Corcoran|Anafarta|2005|p=81}} how human beings respond within relationships when hurt, separated from loved ones, or perceiving a threat.{{sfn|Waters|Corcoran|Anafarta|2005|pp=80–84}} 

Provided any caregiver, all infants become attached--however individual differences in the quality of the relationships remain significant. 

In infants, attachment as a motivational and behavioral system directs the child to seek proximity with a familiar caregiver when they are alarmed, with expectation  they will receive protection and emotional support. 

[[John Bowlby]] believed that the tendency for primate infants to develop attachments to familiar caregivers was the result of evolutionary pressures, since attachment behavior would facilitate the infant's survival in the face of dangers such as predation or exposure to the elements.&lt;ref name=landa2013&gt;{{citation|last1=Landa|first1=S|last2=Duschinsky|first2=R|title=Crittenden's dynamic–maturational model of attachment and adaptation|journal=Review of General Psychology|volume=17|issue=3|year=2013|pages=326–338|doi=10.1037/a0032102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important tenet of attachment theory is an infant needs to develop a relationship with at least one [[primary caregiver]] for the child's successful social and emotional development, and in particular for learning how to regulate their feelings. Any caregiver is likely to become the principal attachment figure if they provide most of the child care and related social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=J|year=1993|title=John Bowlby &amp; Attachment Theory|series=Makers of modern psychotherapy|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-07729-X|ref=harv|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of a sensitive and responsive caregiver, the infant will use the caregiver as a "safe base" from which to explore. 

This relationship can be [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]], as in the mother-child dyad often studied in Western culture, or it can involve a community of caregivers (siblings/extended family/teachers) as can be seen in areas of Africa and South America.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cultural Nature of Human Development.|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vicedo|first=Marga|date=February 14, 2017|title=Putting attachment in its place: Disciplinary and cultural contexts|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17405629.2017.1289838|journal=European Journal of Developmental Psychology|volume=14|pages=684–699|via=|doi=10.1080/17405629.2017.1289838}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Attachment Reconsidered Cultural Perspectives on a Western Theory|last=Quinn and Mageo|first=Naomi and Jeannette Marie|publisher=Palgrave McMillan|year=2013|isbn=978-1-137-38674-8|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

It should be recognized "even sensitive caregivers get it right only about fifty per cent of the time. Their communications are either out of sync, or mismatched. There are times when parents feel tired or distracted. The telephone rings or there is breakfast to prepare. In other words, attuned interactions rupture quite frequently. But the hallmark of a sensitive caregiver is that the ruptures are managed and repaired."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Howe |first=David |date=2011 |title=Attachment across the lifecourse: A brief introduction |location=London |publisher=Palgrave |isbn=978-0-230-34476-1 |oclc=945766768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attachments between infants and caregivers form even if this caregiver is not sensitive and responsive in [[social interaction]]s with them.&lt;ref name="Umemura"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Umemura |first1=Tomo |last2=Jacobvitz |first2=Deborah |last3=Messina |first3=Serena |last4=Hazan |first4=Nancy |date=February 2013 |title=Do toddlers prefer the primary caregiver or the parent with whom they feel more secure? |journal=Infant Behavior &amp; Development |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=102–114 |pmid=23268105 |doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2012.10.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves as best they can within such relationships. 

Based on her established [[Strange situation|Strange Situation Protocol]], research by [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Mary Ainsworth]] in the 1960s and 1970s found children will have different patterns of attachment depending on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.&lt;ref name="Bretherton/Mul"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Bretherton I, Munholland KA |title= Internal Working Models in Attachment Relationships: A Construct Revisited|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|year=1999|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |location=New York|publisher= Guilford Press|isbn= 1-57230-087-6|pages=89–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Four different attachment classifications have been identified in children: [[secure attachment]], anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. 

'''Secure attachment''' is when children feel they can rely on their caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best attachment style. 

'''Anxious-ambivalent attachment''' is when the infant feels separation anxiety when separated from the caregiver and does not feel reassured when the caregiver returns to the infant. 

'''Anxious-avoidant attachment''' is when the infant avoids their parents. 

'''Disorganized attachment''' is when there is a lack of attachment behavior.

In the 1980s, the theory was extended to [[attachment in adults]]. Attachment applies to adults when adults feel close attachment to their parents, their romantic and platonic partners and their friends.

Attachment theory has become the dominant theory used today in the study of infant and toddler behavior and in the fields of infant mental health, treatment of children, and related fields.

==Infant attachment==

[[Image:Mozambique024.jpg|thumb|alt=A young mother smiles up at the camera. On her back is her baby gazing at the camera with an expression of lively interest.|right|The attachment system serves to achieve or maintain proximity to the attachment figure. In close physical proximity this system is not activated, and the infant can direct its attention to the outside world.]]

Within attachment theory, ''attachment'' means "a biological instinct in which proximity to an attachment figure is sought when the child senses or perceives threat or discomfort. Attachment behaviour anticipates a response by the attachment figure which will remove threat or discomfort".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prior|first1=V|last2=Glaser|first2=D|year=2006|title=Understanding Attachment and Attachment Disorders: Theory, Evidence and Practice|series=Child and Adolescent Mental Health, RCPRTU|location=London and Philadelphia|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=9781843102458|ref=harv|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bowlby J | year = 1960 | title = 'Separation Anxiety' | url = | journal = [[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]] | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 89–113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such bonds may be reciprocal between two adults, but between a child and a caregiver these bonds are based on the child's need for safety, security and protection, paramount in infancy and childhood. 

[[John Bowlby]] begins by noting organisms at different levels of the phylogenetic scale regulate instinctive behavior in distinct ways, ranging from primitive reflex-like "fixed action patterns" to complex plan hierarchies with subgoals and strong learning components. In the most complex organisms, instinctive behaviors may be "goal-corrected" with continual on-course adjustments (such as a bird of prey adjusting its flight to the movements of the prey). 

The concept of cybernetically controlled behavioral systems organized as plan hierarchies (Miller, Galanter, and Pribram, 1960) thus came to replace Freud's concept of drive and instinct. Such systems regulate behaviors in ways that need not be rigidly innate, but—depending on the organism—can adapt in greater or lesser degrees to changes in environmental circumstances, provided these do not deviate much from the organism's environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Such flexible organisms pay a price, however, because adaptable behavioral systems can more easily be subverted from their optimal path of development. 

For humans, Bowlby speculates, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness probably resembles present-day hunter-gatherer societies for the purpose of survival, and, ultimately, genetic replication.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=15}} 

Attachment theory is not an exhaustive description of human relationships, nor is it synonymous with love and affection, although these may indicate bonds exist.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=15}} Some infants direct attachment behaviour (proximity seeking) toward more than one attachment figure almost as soon as they start to show discrimination between caregivers; most come to do so during their second year. These figures are arranged hierarchically, with the principal attachment figure at the top.{{sfn|Bowlby|1982|p=304–05}} 

The set-goal of the attachment behavioural system is to maintain the accessibility and availability of the attachment figure.&lt;ref name=kobmad&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Kobak R, Madsen S |year=2008|title= Disruption in Attachment Bonds|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=23–47|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cultures use multiple forms of attachment including the [[Dyadic developmental psychotherapy|dyadic]] model most prominent in Western cultures and [[allomothering]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

'''Alarm''' is the term used for activation of the attachment behavioural system caused by fear of danger. 

'''Anxiety''' is the anticipation or fear of being cut off from the attachment figure. If the figure is unavailable or unresponsive, separation distress occurs.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=16}} 

In infants, physical separation can cause anxiety and anger, followed by sadness and despair. By age three or four, physical separation is no longer such a threat to the child's bond with the attachment figure. Threats to security in older children and adults arise from prolonged absence, breakdowns in communication, emotional unavailability, or signs of rejection or [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment]].&lt;ref name=kobmad/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social and Personality Development Sixth Edition|last=Shaffer|first=David R.|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behaviours===
[[File:Kaitlyn reads a book..jpg|thumb|right|alt=A baby leans at a table staring at a picture book with intense concentration.|Insecure attachment patterns can compromise exploration and the achievement of self-confidence. A securely attached baby is free to concentrate on their environment.]]
The attachment behavioural system serves to achieve or maintain proximity to the attachment figure.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=17}} 

Pre-attachment behaviours occur in the first six months of life. During the first phase (the first eight weeks), infants smile, babble, and cry to attract the attention of potential caregivers. Although infants of this age learn to discriminate between caregivers, these behaviours are directed at anyone in the vicinity. 

During the second phase (two to six months), the infant discriminates between familiar and unfamiliar adults, becoming more responsive toward the caregiver; following and clinging are added to the range of behaviours. The infant's behaviour toward the caregiver becomes organized on a goal-directed basis to achieve the conditions that make it feel secure.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=19}} 

By the end of the first year, the infant is able to display a range of attachment behaviours designed to maintain proximity. These manifest as protesting the caregiver's departure, greeting the caregiver's return, clinging when frightened, and following when able.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karen|first=R|year=1998|title=Becoming Attached: First Relationships and How They Shape Our Capacity to Love|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford and New York|isbn=0195115015|ref=harv|pages=90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the development of locomotion, the infant begins to use the caregiver or caregivers as a "safe base" from which to explore.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=19}} Infant exploration is greater when the caregiver is present because the infant's attachment system is relaxed and it is free to explore. If the caregiver is inaccessible or unresponsive, attachment behaviour is more strongly exhibited.&lt;ref name="ainsworth 67"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ainsworth M |title=Infancy in Uganda: Infant Care and the Growth of Love|year=1967|isbn=0-8018-0010-2 |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety, fear, illness, and fatigue will cause a child to increase attachment behaviours.{{sfn|Karen|1998|p=97}}

After the second year, as the child begins to see the caregiver as an independent person, a more complex and goal-corrected partnership is formed.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=19–20}} Children begin to notice others' goals and feelings and plan their actions accordingly. For example, whereas babies cry because of pain, two-year-olds cry to summon their caregiver, and if that does not work, cry louder, shout, or follow.

===Tenets===
Common attachment behaviours and emotions, displayed in most social primates including humans, are [[Adaption|adaptive]]. The long-term evolution of these species has involved selection for social behaviors that make individual or group survival more likely. The commonly observed attachment behaviour of toddlers staying near familiar people would have had safety advantages in the environment of early adaptation, and has similar advantages today. Bowlby saw the environment of early adaptation as similar to current [[hunter-gatherer]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bowlby|first=J|year=1971|origyear=1969|title=Attachment and Loss|edition=Pelican|volume=Vol. 1. Attachment|location=London|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9780140212761|ref=harv|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a survival advantage in the capacity to sense possibly dangerous conditions such as unfamiliarity, being alone, or rapid approach. According to Bowlby, proximity-seeking to the attachment figure in the face of threat is the "set-goal" of the attachment behavioural system.
[[Image:FemkeD2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A young father lies on his back on a quilt on the floor. He holds his baby daughter up above him with his arms straight and his hands round her ribcage. The baby has her arms and legs stretched out and arches her back smiling directly at the camera.|Early experiences with caregivers gradually give rise to a system of thoughts, memories, beliefs, expectations, emotions, and behaviours about the self and others.]]

Bowlby's original account of a [[Critical period|sensitivity period]] during which attachments can form of between six months and two to three years has been modified by later researchers. These researchers have shown there is indeed a sensitive period during which attachments will form if possible, but the time frame is broader and the effect less fixed and irreversible than first proposed. 

With further research, authors discussing attachment theory have come to appreciate social development is affected by later as well as earlier relationships. Early steps in attachment take place most easily if the infant has one caregiver, or the occasional care of a small number of other people. According to Bowlby, almost from the beginning, many children have more than one figure toward whom they direct attachment behaviour. These figures are not treated alike; there is a strong bias for a child to direct attachment behaviour mainly toward one particular person. Bowlby used the term "monotropy" to describe this bias.{{sfn|Bowlby|1982|p=309}} Researchers and theorists have abandoned this concept insofar as it may be taken to mean the relationship with the special figure differs ''qualitatively'' from that of other figures. Rather, current thinking postulates definite hierarchies of relationships.&lt;ref name="Rutter 95"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Rutter, Michael|year=1995|title=Clinical Implications of Attachment Concepts: Retrospect and Prospect|journal=Journal of Child Psychology &amp; Psychiatry|volume=36|pages=549–71 |pmid=7650083|issue = 4|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1995.tb02314.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Main"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| author=Main M|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|title=Epilogue: Attachment Theory: Eighteen Points with Suggestions for Future Studies|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |year=1999|pages=845–87|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|quote=although there is general agreement an infant or adult will have only a few attachment figures at most, many attachment theorists and researchers believe infants form 'attachment hierarchies' in which some figures are primary, others secondary, and so on. This position can be presented in a stronger form, in which a particular figure is believed continually to take top place ("monotropy")&amp;nbsp;... questions surrounding monotropy and attachment hierarchies remain unsettled|isbn=1-57230-087-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early experiences with caregivers gradually give rise to a system of thoughts, memories, beliefs, expectations, emotions, and behaviours about the self and others. This system, called the "internal working model of social relationships", continues to develop with time and experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mercer|first=J|title=Understanding Attachment: Parenting, child care, and emotional development|year=2006|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0275982173|oclc=61115448|lccn=2005019272|ref=harv|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Internal models regulate, interpret, and predict attachment-related behaviour in the self and the attachment figure. As they develop in line with environmental and developmental changes, they incorporate the capacity to reflect and communicate about past and future attachment relationships.&lt;ref name="Bretherton/Mul"/&gt; They enable the child to handle new types of social interactions; knowing, for example, an infant should be treated differently from an older child, or that interactions with teachers and parents share characteristics. This internal working model continues to develop through adulthood, helping cope with friendships, marriage, and parenthood, all of which involve different behaviours and feelings.{{sfn|Mercer|2006|p=39–40}}&lt;ref name="Bowlby 73"&gt;{{cite book|author= Bowlby J|year=1973|title=Separation: Anger and Anxiety|series= Attachment and loss. Vol. 2 |location=London| publisher=Hogarth |isbn=0-7126-6621-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The development of attachment is a transactional process. Specific attachment behaviours begin with predictable, apparently innate, behaviours in infancy. They change with age in ways determined partly by experiences and partly by situational factors.{{sfn|Bowlby|1971|p=414–21}} As attachment behaviours change with age, they do so in ways shaped by relationships. A child's behaviour when reunited with a caregiver is determined not only by how the caregiver has treated the child before, but on the history of effects the child has had on the caregiver.{{sfn|Bowlby|1971|p=394–395}}&lt;ref name="ainsworth 69"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Ainsworth MD|title = Object relations, dependency, and attachment: a theoretical review of the infant-mother relationship|journal = Child Development|volume = 40|issue = 4|pages = 969–1025|date=December 1969|pmid = 5360395|doi = 10.2307/1127008|publisher = Blackwell Publishing| jstor =1127008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural differences ===
In Western culture child-rearing, there is a focus on single attachment to primarily the mother. This dyadic model is not the only strategy of attachment producing a secure and emotionally adept child. Having a single, dependably responsive and sensitive caregiver (namely the mother) does not guarantee the ultimate success of the child. Results from Israeli, Dutch and east African studies show children with multiple caregivers grow up not only feeling secure, but developed "more enhanced capacities to view the world from multiple perspectives."&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mothers and Others-The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding|last=Hrdy|first=Sarah Blaffer|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-674-03299-6|location=United States of America|pages=130, 131, 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence can be more readily found in hunter-gatherer communities rather than Western day-care contexts.

In hunter-gatherer communities, in the past and present, mothers are the primary caregivers but share the maternal responsibility of ensuring the child's survival with a variety of different [[Allomothering|allomothers]]. So while the mother is important, she is not the only opportunity for relational attachment a child can make. Several group members (with or without blood relation) contribute to the task of bringing up a child, sharing the parenting role and therefore can be sources of multiple attachment. There is evidence of this communal parenting throughout history that "would have significant implications for the evolution of multiple attachment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Attachment Reconsidered: Cultural Perspectives on a Western Theory|last=Quinn|first=Naomi|last2=Mageo|first2=Jeannette Marie|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2013|isbn=978-1-137-38672-4|location=United States of America|pages=73, 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "non-metropolis" India (where "dual income nuclear families" are more the norm / dyadic mother relationship is), where a family normally consists of 3 generations (and if lucky 4: grandparents, parents &amp; child / children, and maybe great-grandparents too), the child / children by default have four / six caregivers from whom to select for their "attachment figure". And a child's "uncles and aunts" (father's siblings and their spouses) also contribute to the child's psycho-social enrichment.

Although it has been debated for years, and there are tedious differences amongst cultures, research shows that the three basic aspects of Attachment Theory are in fact universal. &lt;ref&gt;van IJzendoorn MH, Sagi-Schwartz A. Cross-cultural patterns of attachment: Universal and contextual dimensions. In: Cassidy J, Shaver PR, editors. Handbook of attachment: Theory, research, and clinical applications. 2nd. New York, NY: Guilford Press; 2008. pp. 880–905.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hypotheses are: 1)that secure attachment is the most desirable state, and the most prevalent. 2) maternal sensitivity influences infant attachment patterns and 3) specific infant attachments predict later social and cognitive competence. &lt;ref&gt; van IJzendoorn MH, Sagi-Schwartz A. Cross-cultural patterns of attachment: Universal and contextual dimensions. In: Cassidy J, Shaver PR, editors. Handbook of attachment: Theory, research, and clinical applications. 2nd. New York, NY: Guilford Press; 2008. pp. 880–905.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attachment classification in children: The Strange Situation Protocol==
The most common and empirically supported method for assessing attachment in infants (11 months–17 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by [[Mary Ainsworth]] as a result of her careful in-depth observations of infants with their mothers in Baltimore, USA (see below).&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S."&gt;Ainsworth, M.D.S., Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S. (1978).  Patterns of attachment: A psychological study of the strange situation. Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; The Strange Situation Protocol is a research tool that was not intended for diagnostic purposes. While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the psychiatric diagnosis '[[Reactive attachment disorder|Reactive Attachment Disorder]] (RAD)'. The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure. The idea that insecure attachments are synonymous with RAD is, in fact, not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the research literature. This is not to suggest that the concept of RAD is without merit, but rather that the clinical and research conceptualizations of insecure attachment and [[attachment disorder]] are not synonymous.

The 'Strange Situation' is a laboratory procedure used to assess infants' pattern of attachment to their caregiver by introducing an unexpected threat, two brief separations from the mother followed by reunion. In the procedure, the mother and infant are placed in an unfamiliar playroom equipped with toys while a researcher films the procedure through a one-way mirror. The procedure consists of eight sequential episodes in which the infant experiences both separation from and reunion with the mother as well as the presence of an unfamiliar person (the Stranger).&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S."/&gt; The protocol is conducted in the following format unless modifications are otherwise noted by a particular researcher:

*Episode 1: Mother (or other familiar caregiver), Baby, Experimenter (30 seconds)
*Episode 2: Mother, Baby (3 mins)
*Episode 3: Mother, Baby, Stranger (3 mins)
*Episode 4: Stranger, Baby (3 mins or less)
*Episode 5: Mother, Baby (3 mins)
*Episode 6: Baby Alone (3 mins or less)
*Episode 7: Stranger, Baby (3 mins or less)
*Episode 8: Mother, Baby (3 mins)

Mainly on the basis of their reunion behaviour (although other behaviors are taken into account) in the Strange Situation Paradigm (Ainsworth et al., 1978; see below), infants can be categorized into three 'organized' attachment categories: Group B (later called 'secure'), Group A (later called 'anxious avoidant'), and Group C (later called 'anxious ambivalent'). There are subclassifications for each group (see below).

Beginning in 1970, a series of expansions were added to Ainsworth's original patterns. They include the following: B4 (1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=S.|title=The development of the concept of the object as related to infant-mother attachment.|journal=Child Development|date=1970|volume=41|pages=291–311|doi=10.2307/1127033}}&lt;/ref&gt; A/C (1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crittenden|first1=P.|title=Social networks, quality of parenting, and child development.|journal=Child Development|date=1985|volume=56|pages=1299–1313|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1985.tb00198.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radke-Yarrow|first1=M.|last2=Cummings|first2=E.M.|last3=Kuczynski|first3=L.|last4=Chapman|first4=M.|title=Patterns of attachment in two and three year olds in normal families and families with parental depression|journal=Child Development|date=1985|volume=56|issue=4|pages=884–893|pmid=4042751|doi=10.2307/1130100}}&lt;/ref&gt; D/disorganized (1986), B5 (1988, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Main|first1=M.|last2=Cassidy|first2=J.|title=Categories of response to reunion with the parent at age six: predictability from infant attachment classifications stable across a one-month period.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1988|volume=24|pages=415–426|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.24.3.415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crittenden|first1=P.M.|title=Quality of attachment in the preschool years.|journal=Development and Psychopathology|date=1992|volume=4|pages=209–241|doi=10.1017/s0954579400000110}}&lt;/ref&gt; A+, C+, &amp; Depressed (1992, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crittenden|first1=P.

Each of these patterns reflects a different kind of attachment relationship of the infant with the mother/caregiver. An infant may have a different pattern of attachment to each parent as well as to alternate caregivers. Pattern of attachment is thus not a part of the infant, but is characteristic of the protective and comforting quality of a specific relationship. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioral patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Snyder | first1 = R. | last2 = Shapiro | first2 = S. | last3 = Treleaven | first3 = D. | year = 2012 | title = Attachment Theory and Mindfulness | url = | journal = Journal of Child &amp; Family Studies | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 709–717 | doi=10.1007/s10826-011-9522-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attachment patterns==

"The strength of a child's attachment behaviour in a given circumstance does not indicate the 'strength' of the attachment bond. Some insecure children will routinely display very pronounced attachment behaviours, while many secure children find that there is no great need to engage in either intense or frequent shows of attachment behaviour."&lt;ref&gt;Howe, D. (2011) Attachment across the lifecourse, London: Palgrave, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;  “Individuals with different attachment styles have different beliefs about romantic love period, availability, trust capability of love partners and love readiness.” &lt;ref&gt;Honari, B., &amp; Saremi, A. A. (2015). The Study of Relationship between Attachment Styles and Obsessive Love Style. Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 165, 152-159. doi:10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.12.617&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secure attachment===
{{Main|Secure attachment}}

A toddler who is securely attached to his or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create securely attached children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Schacter|Schacter, D.L.]] et al. (2009). Psychology, Second Edition. New York: Worth Publishers. pp.441&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional Ainsworth et al. (1978) coding of the Strange Situation, secure infants are denoted as "Group B" infants and they are further subclassified as B1, B2, B3, and B4.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S."/&gt; Although these subgroupings refer to different stylistic responses to the comings and goings of the caregiver, they were not given specific labels by Ainsworth and colleagues, although their descriptive behaviors led others (including students of Ainsworth) to devise a relatively "loose" terminology for these subgroups. B1's have been referred to as "secure-reserved", B2's as 'secure-inhibited', B3's as "secure-balanced", and B4's as "secure-reactive". In academic publications however, the classification of infants (if subgroups are denoted) is typically simply "B1" or "B2" although more theoretical and review-oriented papers surrounding attachment theory may use the above terminology.

Securely attached children are best able to explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in how to cope with the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment can be seen as the most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.&lt;ref name="Aronoff, J. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aronoff | first1 = J | year = 2012 | title = Parental Nurturance in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample: Theory, Coding, and Scores | url = | journal = Cross-Cultural Research | volume = 46 | issue = 4| pages = 315–347 | doi=10.1177/1069397112450851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anxious-ambivalent attachment===
Anxious-ambivalent attachment is also misnamed as "resistant attachment".&lt;ref name="Ainsworth,1978a"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Ainsworth MD, Blehar M, Waters E, Wall S |year=1978|title=Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation|publisher= Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location =Hillsdale NJ|isbn=0-89859-461-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a child with an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when his mother returns.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S."/&gt; The anxious-ambivalent strategy is a response to unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solomon | first1 = J. | last2 = George | first2 = C. | last3 = De Jong | first3 = A. | year = 1995 | title = Children classified as controlling at age six: Evidence of disorganized representational strategies and aggression at home and at school | url = | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 447–447 | doi=10.1017/s0954579400006623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P. (1999) 'Danger and development: the organization of self-protective strategies' in Atypical Attachment in Infancy and Early Childhood Among Children at Developmental Risk ed. Joan I. Vondra &amp; Douglas Barnett, Oxford: Blackwell pp.&amp;nbsp;145–171&lt;/ref&gt;

The C1 (ambivalent resistant) subtype is coded when "resistant behavior is particularly conspicuous. The mixture of seeking and yet resisting contact and interaction has an unmistakably angry quality and indeed an angry tone may characterize behavior in the preseparation episodes".&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt;

Regarding the C2 (ambivalent passive) subtype, Ainsworth et al. wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps the most conspicuous characteristic of C2 infants is their passivity. Their exploratory behavior is limited throughout the SS and their interactive behaviors are relatively lacking in active initiation. Nevertheless, in the reunion episodes they obviously want proximity to and contact with their mothers, even though they tend to use signalling rather than active approach, and protest against being put down rather than actively resisting release&amp;nbsp;... In general the C2 baby is not as conspicuously angry as the C1 baby.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Research done by McCarthy and Taylor (1999), found that children with abusive childhood experiences were more likely to develop ambivalent attachments. The study also found that children with ambivalent attachments were more likely to experience difficulties in maintaining intimate relationships as adults.&lt;ref name="mccarthy1999avoidant"&gt;{{cite news|title = Avoidant/ambivalent attachment style as a mediator between abusive childhood experiences and adult relationship difficulties|last1 = McCarthy|	first1 = Gerard|last2 = Taylor|first2 = Alan|journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|volume = 40|number = 3|pages = 465–477|year = 1999|doi = 10.1111/1469-7610.00463|ref = mccarthy1999avoidant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anxious-avoidant attachment===

An infant with an anxious-avoidant pattern of attachment will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ainsworth | first1 = M.

Infants are depicted as anxious-avoidant when there is:&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;conspicuous avoidance of the mother in the reunion episodes which is likely to consist of ignoring her altogether, although there may be some pointed looking away, turning away, or moving away&amp;nbsp;... If there is a greeting when the mother enters, it tends to be a mere look or a smile&amp;nbsp;... Either the baby does not approach his mother upon reunion, or they approach in "abortive" fashions with the baby going past the mother, or it tends to only occur after much coaxing&amp;nbsp;... If picked up, the baby shows little or no contact-maintaining behavior; he tends not to cuddle in; he looks away and he may squirm to get down.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ainsworth's narrative records showed that infants avoided the caregiver in the stressful Strange Situation Procedure when they had a history of experiencing rebuff of attachment behaviour. The infant's needs were frequently not met and the infant had come to believe that communication of emotional needs had no influence on the caregiver. 

Ainsworth's student [[Mary Main]] theorized that avoidant behaviour in the Strange Situation Procedure should be regarded as "a conditional strategy, which paradoxically permits whatever proximity is possible under conditions of maternal rejection" by de-emphasising attachment needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Main M | year = 1979 | title = The "ultimate" causation of some infant attachment phenomena | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 640–643 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00064992}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Main proposed that avoidance has two functions for an infant whose caregiver is consistently unresponsive to their needs. Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver—avoiding a situation in which the child is overwhelmed with emotion ("disorganized distress"), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.&lt;ref&gt;Main, M. (1977a) Analysis of a peculiar form of reunion behaviour seen in some day-care children. In R. Webb (ed.) Social Development in Childhood (pp.&amp;nbsp;33–78), Baltimore: Johns Hopkins&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{Anchor|disorganized attachment}}Disorganized/disoriented attachment===
Ainsworth herself was the first to find difficulties in fitting all infant behaviour into the three classifications used in her Baltimore study. Ainsworth and colleagues sometimes observed "tense movements such as hunching the shoulders, putting the hands behind the neck and tensely cocking the head, and so on. It was our clear impression that such tension movements signified stress, both because they tended to occur chiefly in the separation episodes and because they tended to be prodromal to crying. Indeed, our hypothesis is that they occur when a child is attempting to control crying, for they tend to vanish if and when crying breaks through."&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, M.D., Blehar, M, Waters, E, &amp; Wall, S. (1978) Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation, Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, p.282&lt;/ref&gt; Such observations also appeared in the doctoral theses of Ainsworth's students. Crittenden, for example, noted that one abused infant in her doctoral sample was classed as secure (B) by her undergraduate coders because her strange situation behavior was "without either avoidance or ambivalence, she did show stress-related stereotypic headcocking throughout the strange situation. This pervasive behavior, however, was the only clue to the extent of her stress".&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P.M. (1983) 'Mother and Infant Patterns of Attachment' Unpublished PhD Dissertation, University of Virginia, May 1983, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1983, Crittenden offered A/C and other new organized classifications (see below). Drawing on records of behaviours discrepant with the A, B and C classifications, a fourth classification was added by Ainsworth's colleague [[Mary Main]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Mary |last1=Main |first2=Judith |last2=Solomon |year=1990 |chapter=Procedures for Identifying Infants as Disorganized/Disoriented during the Ainsworth Strange Situation |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzHIfiCXE8EC&amp;pg=PA121 |pages=121–60 |editor1-first=Mark T. |editor1-last=Greenberg |editor2-first=Dante |editor2-last=Cicchetti |editor3-first=E. Mark |editor3-last=Cummings |title=Attachment in the Preschool Years: Theory, Research, and Intervention |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-30630-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Strange Situation, the attachment system is expected to be activated by the departure and return of the caregiver. If the behaviour of the infant does not appear to the observer to be coordinated in a smooth way across episodes to achieve either proximity or some relative proximity with the caregiver, then it is considered 'disorganized' as it indicates a disruption or flooding of the attachment system (e.g. by fear). Infant behaviours in the Strange Situation Protocol coded as disorganized/disoriented include overt displays of fear; contradictory behaviours or affects occurring simultaneously or sequentially; stereotypic, asymmetric, misdirected or jerky movements; or freezing and apparent dissociation. Lyons-Ruth has urged, however, that it should be more widely "recognized that 52% of disorganized infants continue to approach the caregiver, seek comfort, and cease their distress without clear ambivalent or avoidant behavior".&lt;ref&gt;Karlen Lyons-Ruth, Jean-Francois Bureau, M. Ann Easterbrooks, Ingrid Obsuth, Kate Hennighausen &amp; Lauriane Vulliez-Coady (2013) Parsing the construct of maternal insensitivity: distinct longitudinal pathways associated with early maternal withdrawal, Attachment &amp; Human
Development, 15:5–6, 562–582&lt;/ref&gt;

There is rapidly growing interest in disorganized attachment from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kochanska | first1 = Grazyna | last2 = Kim | first2 = Sanghag | year = 2013 | title = Early Attachment Organization With Both Parents and Future Behavior Problems: From Infancy to Middle Childhood | journal = Child Development | volume = 84 | issue = 1| pages = 283–296 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01852.x | pmid=23005703 | pmc=3530645}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticized by some for being too encompassing, including Ainsworth herself.&lt;ref&gt;Svanberg, P.O. (2009). Promoting a secure attachment through early assessment and interventions. In J. Barlow &amp; P.O. Svanberg (Eds.) Keeping the Baby in Mind, (pp.&amp;nbsp;100–114), London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as "open-ended, in the sense that subcategories may be distinguished", as she worried that too many different forms of behaviour might be treated as if they were the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, M. (1990). 'Epilogue' in Attachment in the Preschool Years, ed. M.T. Greenberg, D. Ciccheti &amp; E.M. Cummings. Chicago, IL: Chicago University Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;463–488&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger).&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, J. &amp; George, C. (1999a) The place of disorganization in attachment theory. In Judith Solomon &amp; Carol George (Eds) Attachment Disorganization (pp&amp;nbsp;3–32), p.27, NY: Guilford&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Crittenden argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that "even disorganized attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent".&lt;ref&gt;Sroufe, A. Egeland, B., Carlson, E. &amp; Collins, W.A. (2005) The Development of the person: the Minnesota study of risk and adaptation from birth to adulthood, NY: Guilford Press, p.245&lt;/ref&gt; However, "the presumption that many indices of 'disorganization' are aspects of organized patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganization, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children's capacity for response."&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P. (1999) 'Danger and development: the organization of self-protective strategies' in Atypical Attachment in Infancy and Early Childhood Among Children at Developmental Risk ed. Joan I. Vondra &amp; Douglas Barnett, Oxford: Blackwell pp.&amp;nbsp;159–160&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "Children placed in care, especially more than once, often have intrusions. In videos of the Strange Situation Procedure, they tend to occur when a rejected/neglected child approaches the stranger in an intrusion of desire for comfort, then loses muscular control and falls to the floor, overwhelmed by the intruding fear of the unknown, potentially dangerous, strange person."&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P. &amp; Landini, A (2011) Assessing Adult Attachment: A Dynamic-Maturational Approach to Discourse Analysis, NY: W.W.

=== Categorization differences across cultures ===
Across different cultures deviations from the Strange Situation Protocol have been observed.  A Japanese study in 1986 (Takahashi) studied 60 Japanese mother-infant pairs and compared them with Ainsworth's distributional pattern. Although the ranges for securely attached and insecurely attached had no significant differences in proportions, the Japanese insecure group consisted of only resistant children with no children categorized as avoidant.  This may be because the Japanese child rearing philosophy stressed close mother infant bonds than in Western cultures.  In Northern Germany, Grossmann et al. (Grossmann, Huber, &amp; Wartner, 1981; Grossmann, Spangler, Suess, &amp; Unzner, 1985) replicated the Ainsworth Strange Situation with 46 mother infant pairs and found a different distributions of attachment classifications with a high number of avoidant infants: 52% avoidant, 34% secure, and 13% resistant (Grossmann et al., 1985).  Another study in Israel found there was a high frequency of an ambivalent pattern which according to Grossman et al. (1985) could be attributed a greater parental push toward children's independence. Although it has been debated for years, and there are tedious differences amongst cultures, research shows that the three basic aspects of Attachment Theory are in fact universal. &lt;ref&gt;van IJzendoorn MH, Sagi-Schwartz A.

New York, NY: Guilford Press; 2008. pp. 880–905.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hypotheses are: 1)that secure attachment is the most desirable state, and the most prevalent. 2) maternal sensitivity influences infant attachment patterns and 3) specific infant attachments predict later social and cognitive competence. &lt;ref&gt; van IJzendoorn MH, Sagi-Schwartz A.

=== Later patterns and the dynamic-maturational model ===
Techniques have been developed to allow verbal ascertainment of the child's state of mind with respect to attachment. An example is the "stem story", in which a child is given the beginning of a story that raises attachment issues and asked to complete it. For older children, adolescents and adults, semi-structured interviews are used in which the manner of relaying content may be as significant as the content itself.&lt;ref name="Schaffer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Schaffer R|year=2007|title=Introducing Child Psychology|publisher= Blackwell|location=Oxford|pages=83–121|isbn=0-631-21628-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are no substantially validated measures of attachment for middle childhood or early adolescence (approximately 7 to 13 years of age).&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |year=2005 |volume=44 |issue=11 |pages=1206–19 |title=Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with reactive attachment disorder of infancy and early childhood |vauthors=Boris NW, Zeanah CH |others=Work Group on Quality Issues |pmid=16239871 |url=http://www.aacap.org/galleries/PracticeParameters/rad.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=September 13, 2009 |doi=10.1097/01.chi.0000177056.41655.ce |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824051123/http://www.aacap.org/galleries/PracticeParameters/rad.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some studies of older children have identified further attachment classifications. Main and Cassidy observed that disorganized behavior in infancy can develop into a child using caregiving-controlling or punitive behaviour in order to manage a helpless or dangerously unpredictable caregiver. In these cases, the child's behaviour is organized, but the behaviour is treated by researchers as a form of 'disorganization' (D) since the hierarchy in the family is no longer organized according to parenting authority.&lt;ref&gt;Main, M. &amp; Cassidy, J. (1988) Categories of response to reunion with the parent at age 6.
Developmental Psychology 24(3): 415–426&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patricia McKinsey Crittenden]] has elaborated classifications of further forms of avoidant and ambivalent attachment behaviour. These include the caregiving and punitive behaviours also identified by Main and Cassidy (termed A3 and C3 respectively), but also other patterns such as compulsive compliance with the wishes of a threatening parent (A4).&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P.M. (2008) Raising Parents: Attachment, Parenting and Child Safety, London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Crittenden's ideas developed from Bowlby's proposal that "given certain adverse circumstances during childhood, the selective exclusion of information of certain sorts may be adaptive. Yet, when during adolescence and adulthood the situation changes, the persistent exclusion of the same forms of information may become maladaptive".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bowlby|first=J|year=1980|title=Loss|location=London|publisher=Penguin|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crittenden proposed that the basic components of human experience of danger are two kinds of information:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strathearn | first1 = L. | last2 = Fonagy | first2 = P. | last3 = Amico | first3 = J.A. | last4 = Montague | first4 = P.R. | year = 2009 | title = Adult attachment predicts mother's brain and peripheral oxytocin response to infant cues | url = | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 34 | issue = 13| pages = 2655–2666 | doi=10.1038/npp.2009.103 | pmid=19710635 | pmc=3041266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1.	'Affective information' – the emotions provoked by the potential for danger, such as anger or fear. Crittenden terms this "affective information". In childhood this information would include emotions provoked by the unexplained absence of an attachment figure. Where an infant is faced with insensitive or rejecting parenting, one strategy for maintaining the availability of their attachment figure is to try to exclude from consciousness or from expressed behaviour any emotional information that might result in rejection.

2.	Causal or other sequentially-ordered knowledge about the potential for safety or danger. In childhood this would include knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven. If knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven is subject to segregation, then the infant can try to keep the attention of their caregiver through clingy or aggressive behaviour, or alternating combinations of the two. Such behaviour may increase the availability of an attachment figure who otherwise displays inconsistent or misleading responses to the infant's attachment behaviours, suggesting the unreliability of protection and safety.&lt;ref name=landa2013/&gt;

Crittenden proposes that both kinds of information can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a 'strategy' to maintain the availability of an attachment figure (See section above on Disorganized/disoriented attachment for distinction of "Types"): "Type A strategies were hypothesized to be based on reducing perception of threat to reduce the disposition to respond. Type C was hypothesized to be based on heightening perception of threat to increase the disposition to respond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crittenden | first1 = P. | last2 = Newman | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = Comparing models of borderline personality disorder: Mothers' experience, self-protective strategies, and dispositional representations | url = | journal = Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 433–451 [435] | doi=10.1177/1359104510368209 | pmid=20603429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Type A strategies split off emotional information about feeling threatened and type C strategies split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about how and why the attachment figure is available. By contrast, type B strategies effectively utilise both kinds of information without much distortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crittenden | first1 = P.M. | year = 1992 | title = Children's strategies for coping with adverse home environments | url = | journal = Child Abuse &amp; Neglect | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 329–343 | doi=10.1016/0145-2134(92)90043-q | pmid=1617468}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and can develop a secure attachment to their caregiver since they trust that their needs and communications will be heeded.

===Significance of patterns===
Research based on data from longitudinal studies, such as the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care]] and the Minnesota Study of Risk and Adaption from Birth to Adulthood, and from cross-sectional studies, consistently shows associations between early attachment classifications and peer relationships as to both quantity and quality. Lyons-Ruth, for example, found that "for each additional withdrawing behavior displayed by mothers in relation to their infant's attachment cues in the Strange Situation Procedure, the likelihood of clinical referral by service providers was increased by 50%."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lyons-Ruth | first1 = Karlen | last2 = Jean- | last3 = Bureau | first3 = Francois | last4 = Easterbrooks | first4 = M.

There is an extensive body of research demonstrating a significant association between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains.&lt;ref name=PPP&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Pearce JW, Pezzot-Pearce TD |title=Psychotherapy of abused and neglected children|publisher=Guilford press|edition=2nd|location=New York and London|year=2007|isbn=978-1-59385-213-9|pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, but it is a liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood.{{sfn|Karen|1998|p=248–66}} Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment.&lt;ref name="Schaffer"/&gt; Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function.&lt;ref name=bercasapp&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2008|vauthors=Berlin LJ, Cassidy J, Appleyard K |title=The Influence of Early Attachments on Other Relationships|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=333–47|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.&lt;ref name="Schaffer"/&gt;

Studies have suggested that infants with a high-risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may express attachment security differently from infants with a low-risk for ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haltigan|first=JD|author2=Ekas NV|author3= Seifer R|author4= Messinger DS|title=Attachment security in infants at-risk for autism spectrum disorders.|journal=Attachment security in infants at-risk for autism spectrum disorders|date=July 2011|volume=41|issue=7|pages=962–967|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=7&amp;sid=4ee26e89-71a6-4d34-930d-cfd04877e6fa%40sessionmgr11&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=cmedm&amp;AN=20859669|accessdate=1 December 2011|doi=10.1007/s10803-010-1107-7|pmid=20859669|pmc=4486071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral problems and social competence in insecure children increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in quality of parenting and the degree of risk in the family environment.&lt;ref name=bercasapp/&gt;

Some authors have questioned the idea that a [[wikt:taxonomy|taxonomy]] of categories representing a qualitative difference in attachment relationships can be developed. Examination of data from 1,139 15-month-olds showed that variation in attachment patterns was continuous rather than grouped.&lt;ref name="FraSpe"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fraley RC, Spieker SJ |title = Are infant attachment patterns continuously or categorically distributed?

However, it has relatively little relevance for attachment theory itself, which "neither requires nor predicts discrete patterns of attachment."&lt;ref name="WatBea"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Waters E, Beauchaine TP |title = Are there really patterns of attachment? Comment on Fraley and Spieker (2003)|journal = Developmental Psychology|volume = 39|issue = 3|pages = 417–22; discussion 423–9|date=May 2003|pmid = 12760512 |doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.39.3.417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that gender differences in attachment patterns of [[Adaption|adaptive]] significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a very high risk environment. [[Adrenarche]] is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.&lt;ref name=delguid&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sex, attachment, and the development of reproductive strategies|author=Del Giudice M|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|year=2009|volume=32|pages=1–67|doi=10.1017/S0140525X09000016|pmid=19210806|issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in attachment during childhood and adolescence==
Childhood and adolescence allows the development of an internal working model useful for forming attachments. This internal working model is related to the individual's state of mind which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on childhood and adolescent experience. The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those who rely more on the individual's state of mind alone in forming new attachments.

Age, cognitive growth, and continued social experience advance the development and complexity of the internal working model. Attachment-related behaviours lose some characteristics typical of the infant-toddler period and take on age-related tendencies. The preschool period involves the use of negotiation and bargaining.&lt;ref name= "Waters"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Waters E, Kondo-Ikemura K, Posada G, Richters J |year=1991|title=Learning to love: Mechanisms and milestones|journal= Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology|volume= 23|issue=Self–Processes and Development|veditors=Gunnar M, Sroufe T |location= Hillsdale, NJ|publisher=Erlbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, four-year-olds are not distressed by separation if they and their caregiver have already negotiated a shared plan for the separation and reunion.&lt;ref name=marbrit&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Marvin RS, Britner PA |year=2008|title= Normative Development: The Ontogeny of Attachment|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=269–94|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Children marbles.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Three children aged about six years are in a group on the ground, a boy and girl kneeling and another boy seated cross-legged. The two kneeling children hold marbles. There are other marbles in a bag on the ground. They appear to be negotiating over the marbles. The third child is watching.|Peers become important in middle childhood and have an influence distinct from that of parents.]]

Ideally, these social skills become incorporated into the internal working model to be used with other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship.&lt;ref name= "Waters"/&gt; By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact—or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed—is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7–11), there may be a shift toward mutual [[coregulation]] of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.&lt;ref name= "Waters"/&gt;

The attachment system used by adolescences is seen as a "safety regulating system" whose main function is to promote physical and psychological safety. There are 2 different events that can trigger the attachment system. Those triggers include, the presence of a potential danger or stress, internal and external, and a threat of accessibility and or availability of an attachment figure. The ultimate goal of the attachment system is security, so during a time of danger or inaccessibility the behavioral system accepts felt security in the context of the availability of protection. By adolescences we are able to find security through a variety of things, such as food, exercise, and social media. &lt;ref&gt;Kerns, Kathryn A., and Rhonda A. Richardson. Attachment in Middle Childhood. Guilford Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Felt security can be achieved through a number of ways, and often without the physical presence of the attachment figure. Higher levels of maturity allows adolescences teens to more capably interact with their environment on their own because the environment is perceived as less threatening. Adolescences teens will also see an increase in cognitive, emotional and behavioral maturity that dictates whether or not teens are less likely to experience conditions that activate their need for an attachment figure. For example, when teenagers get sick and stay home from school, surely they want their parents to be home so they can take care of them, but they are also able to stay home by themselves without experiencing serious amounts of distress. &lt;ref&gt;McElhaney, Kathleen Boykin, et al. “Attachment and Autonomy During Adolescence.” Wiley Online Library, Wiley-Blackwell, 30 Oct. 2009, onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/9780470479193.adlpsy001012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are the attachment style differences during adolescences. &lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Harry, and B. Bradford Brown. “Primary Attachment to Parents and Peers during Adolescence: Differences by Attachment Style.” Journal of Youth and Adolescence, vol. 30, no. 6, 2001, pp. 653–674., doi:10.1023/a:1012200511045.&lt;/ref&gt;
Secure adolescences are expected to hold their mothers at a higher rate than all other support figures, including father, boy and girlfriends, and best friends.
Insecure adolescences identify more strongly with their peers than their parents as their primary attachment figures. Their friends are seen as a significantly strong source of attachment support.
Dismissing adolescences rate their parents as a less significant source of attachment support and would consider themselves as their primary attachment figure.
Preoccupied adolescences would rate their parents a their primary source of attachment support and would consider themselves as a much less significant source of attachment support.

==Attachment in adults==
{{Main|Attachment in adults}}{{See also|Attachment measures}}
Attachment theory was extended to adult [[romantic relationship]]s in the late 1980s by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver. Four styles of attachment have been identified in adults: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant. These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganized/disoriented.

'''Securely attached''' adults tend to have positive views of themselves, their partners and their relationships. They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Feeling sure has to do with a persons perception of control, feelings of competence, and a belief that they posses the ability to meet the challenges that they will face in the future. With adults, attachments in general, are more cumulative and much more multifaceted than earlier attachments. There are more exchanges of support within someones inner circle relationships or secure relationships, such as respect, confiding, reassurance, sick care, talking about one's health, and talking about things that could Corry or upset them. these types of exchanges provide adults with a secure base that they are able to depend on on a daily basis. &lt;ref&gt;Sperling, Michael B., and William H. Berman. Attachment in Adults: Clinical and Developmental Perspectives. Guilford Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anxious-preoccupied''' adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They tend to be less trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. the anxiety that adults feel prevent the establishment of satisfactory defense exclusion. Thus, it is possible that individuals that have been anxiously attached to their attachment figure or figures have not been able to develop sufficient defenses against separation anxiety. Because their lack of preparation these individuals will then overreact to the anticipation of separation or the actual separation from their attachment figure. The anxiety comes from an individuals intense and/or unstable relationship   that live the anxious or preoccupied individual in relatively defenseless. &lt;ref&gt;Sperling, Michael B., and William H. Berman. Attachment in Adults: Clinical and Developmental Perspectives. Guilford Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Adults with this attachment style tend to look way to far into things, whether that's a text message or a face-to-face conversation. Their thought and actions can lead to a painful cycle of self-fulfilling prophecies and even self-sabotage. They often seek a dismissive-avoidant partner. &lt;ref&gt;Rivera, Chelsea. “Avoidant Attachment: The Advanced Guide.” Depression Alliance, 29 May 2018, www.depressionalliance.org/avoidant-attachment/.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dismissive-avoidant''' adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with conflict by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Adults lack the interest of forming close relationships and maintaining emotional closeness with the people around them. They have a great amount of distrust in others but at the same time possess a positive model of self, they would prefer to invest in their own ego skills. Because of their distrust they cannot be convinced that other people have the ability to deliver emotional support. They try to create high levels of self-esteem by investing disproportionately in their abilities or accomplishments. These adults maintain their positive views of self, based on their personal achievements and competence rather than searching for and feeling acceptance from others. These adults will explicitly reject or minimize the importance of emotional attachment and passively avoid relationships when they feel as though they are becoming too close. They strive for self-reliance and independence. When it comes to the opinions of others about themselves, they are very indifferent and are relatively hesitant to positive feedback from their peers. Dismissive avoidance can also be explained as the result of defensive deactivation of the attachment system to avoid potential rejection, or genuine disregard for interpersonal closeness. &lt;ref&gt;Carvallo, Mauricio, and Shira Gabriel. “No Man Is an Island: The Need to Belong and Dismissing Avoidant Attachment Style.” PsycEXTRA Dataset, 2006, doi:10.1037/e511092014-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fearful-avoidant''' adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust their partners and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.&lt;ref name="Hazan, Shaver, 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR |title = Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume = 52|issue = 3|pages = 511–24|date=March 1987|pmid = 3572722|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1990"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR |year=1990|title= Love and work: An attachment theoretical perspective|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 59|pages= 270–80|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.270|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1994"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR |year=1994|title= Attachment as an organizational framework for research on close relationships|journal= Psychological Inquiry|volume= 5|pages= 1–22|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BarthoHoro"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bartholomew K, Horowitz LM |title = Attachment styles among young adults: a test of a four-category model|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume = 61|issue = 2|pages = 226–44|date=August 1991|pmid = 1920064|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexually, securely attached individuals are less likely to be involved in one-night stands or sexual activity outside of the primary relationship, and more likely to report mutual initiation and enjoyment of sex. 

Dismissive-avoidant individuals tend to report activities reflecting low psychological intimacy (one-night sex, extra-dyadic sex, sex without love), as well as less enjoyment of physical contact. Research has demonstrated that for both sexes, insecure-ambivalent attachment was related to enjoyment of holding and caressing, but not of more clearly sexual behaviors.  

Relationally, insecure individuals tend to be partnered with insecure individuals, and secure individuals with secure individuals. Insecure relationships tend to be enduring but less emotionally satisfying compared to the relationship(s) of two securely attached individuals.  

Attachment styles are activated from the first date onwards and impact relationship dynamics and how a relationship ends. Secure attachment has been shown to allow for better conflict resolution in a relationship and for one's ability to exit an unsatisfying relationship compared to other attachment types.  Secure individuals authentic high self-esteem and positive view of others allows for this as they are confident that they will find another relationship.  Secure attachment has also shown to allow for the successful processing of relational losses (e.g. death, rejection, infidelity, abandonment etc.)  Attachment has also been show to impact caregiving behavior in relationships, too (Shaver &amp; Cassidy, 2018)

The organization of mental working models is more stable while the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment fluctuates more. Some authors have suggested that adults do not hold a single set of working models. Instead, on one level they have a set of rules and assumptions about attachment relationships in general. On another level they hold information about specific relationships or relationship events. Information at different levels need not be consistent. Individuals can therefore hold different internal working models for different relationships.&lt;ref name="Pietro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rholes, Simpson, 2004"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Rholes WS, Simpson JA |year=2004|title= Attachment theory: Basic concepts and contemporary questions|veditors=Rholes WS, Simpson JA |isbn=1-59385-047-6|encyclopedia= Adult Attachment: Theory, Research, and Clinical Implications|pages= 3–14|location= New York|publisher= Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of different measures of adult attachment, the most common being self-report questionnaires and coded interviews based on the [[Attachment measures#Adult Attachment Interview .28AAI.29|Adult Attachment Interview]]. The various measures were developed primarily as research tools, for different purposes and addressing different domains, for example romantic relationships, platonic relationships, parental relationships or peer relationships. Some classify an adult's state of mind with respect to attachment and attachment patterns by reference to childhood experiences, while others assess relationship behaviours and security regarding parents and peers.&lt;ref name=crofrasha&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2008|vauthors=Crowell JA, Fraley RC, Shaver PR |title=Measurement of Individual Differences in Adolescent and Adult Attachment|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=599–634|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of attachment theory}}
{{see also|Maternal deprivation}}

===Maternal deprivation===
The early thinking of the [[Object relations theory|object relations school]] of [[psychoanalysis]], particularly [[Melanie Klein]], influenced Bowlby. However, he profoundly disagreed with the prevalent psychoanalytic belief that infants' responses relate to their internal fantasy life rather than real-life events. As Bowlby formulated his concepts, he was influenced by case studies on disturbed and delinquent children, such as those of [[William Goldfarb]] published in 1943 and 1945.&lt;ref name= "Bowlby 51 quote"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Maternal Care and Mental Health |year=1951 |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=355–533 |location=Geneva |publisher=World Health Organization |quote=Each put his finger on the child's inability to make relationships as being the central feature from which all other disturbances sprang, and on the history of institutionalization or, as in the case quoted, of the child's being shifted about from one foster-mother to another as being its cause |last=Bowlby |first=John |pmid=14821768 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/issues/172381/ |pmc=2554008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref name="Bowlby 44"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Bowlby J|year=1944|title=Forty-four juvenile thieves: Their characters and home life|journal= International Journal of Psychoanalysis|volume=25 |issue=19–52 |pages=107–27|quote= sometimes referred to by Bowlby's colleagues as "Ali Bowlby and the Forty Thieves"}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Prayer Time in the Nursery--Five Points House of Industry.png|right|280px|thumb|alt=Two rows of little boys, about 20 in total, kneel before their beds in the dormitory of a residential nursery.

He and Bowlby collaborated in making the 1952 documentary film ''A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital'' which was instrumental in a campaign to alter hospital restrictions on visits by parents.&lt;ref name= "Schwartz"&gt;{{cite book|author= Schwartz J|title= Cassandra's Daughter: A History of Psychoanalysis|year=1999|page=225 |publisher= Viking/Allen Lane |location=New York|isbn= 0-670-88623-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1951 monograph for the [[World Health Organization]], [[Maternal deprivation|''Maternal Care and Mental Health'']], Bowlby put forward the hypothesis that "the infant and young child should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment", the lack of which may have significant and irreversible mental health consequences. This was also published as ''Child Care and the Growth of Love'' for public consumption. The central proposition was influential but highly controversial.&lt;ref name="WHO 62"&gt;{{cite book|contribution= Preface|title=Deprivation of Maternal Care: A Reassessment of its Effects|location=Geneva|publisher= World Health Organization|series= Public Health Papers|year=1962|issue= No. 14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there was limited empirical data and no comprehensive theory to account for such a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bowlby J|year=1988|title=A Secure Base: Clinical Applications of Attachment Theory|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415006406|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Bowlby's theory sparked considerable interest in the nature of early relationships, giving a strong impetus to, (in the words of Mary Ainsworth), a "great body of research" in an extremely difficult, complex area.&lt;ref name="WHO 62"/&gt; Bowlby's work (and Robertson's films) caused a virtual revolution in hospital visiting by parents, hospital provision for children's play, educational and social needs and the use of residential nurseries. Over time, orphanages were abandoned in favour of foster care or family-style homes in most developed countries.&lt;ref name=rut&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author= Rutter M|year=2008|title= Implications of Attachment Theory and Research for Child Care Policies|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=958–74|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the publication of ''Maternal Care and Mental Health'', Bowlby sought new understanding from the fields of evolutionary biology, ethology, [[developmental psychology]], [[cognitive science]] and control systems theory. He formulated the innovative proposition that mechanisms underlying an infant's emotional tie to the caregiver(s) emerged as a result of [[evolutionary pressure]]. He set out to develop a theory of motivation and behaviour control built on science rather than Freud's psychic energy model. Bowlby argued that with attachment theory he had made good the "deficiencies of the data and the lack of theory to link alleged cause and effect" of ''Maternal Care and Mental Health''.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 86"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bowlby J|date=December 1986 |title= Citation Classic, ''Maternal Care and Mental Health''|url= http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1986/A1986F063100001.pdf|format=PDF|volume=50|issue= 18|publisher=Current Contents|accessdate = July 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Szymon i Krystian 003.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A young mother kneels in a garden with her two children.

====Ethology====
Bowlby's attention was first drawn to [[ethology]] when he read [[Konrad Lorenz]]'s 1952 publication in draft form (although Lorenz had published earlier work).&lt;ref name="lorenz 37"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Lorenz KZ|year = 1937|title = The companion in the bird's world|journal = The Auk|volume = 54|issue = 3|pages = 245–73|doi=10.2307/4078077|jstor = 4078077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important influences were ethologists [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and [[Robert Hinde]].{{sfn|Holmes|1993|p=62}} Bowlby subsequently collaborated with Hinde.&lt;ref name="3 vans"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Bowlby J |year = 2007|title = John Bowlby and ethology: An annotated interview with Robert Hinde|journal = Attachment &amp; Human Development|volume = 9|issue = 4|pages = 321–35|doi = 10.1080/14616730601149809|pmid = 17852051}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 Bowlby stated "the time is ripe for a unification of psychoanalytic concepts with those of ethology, and to pursue the rich vein of research which this union suggests."&lt;ref name="bowlby 53"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bowlby J |title=Critical Phases in the Development of Social Responses in Man and Other Animals |year=1953 |journal=New Biology| volume=14|pages=25–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Konrad Lorenz had examined the phenomenon of "[[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]]", a behaviour characteristic of some birds and mammals which involves rapid learning of recognition by the young, of a [[wikt:conspecific|conspecific]] or comparable object. After recognition comes a tendency to follow.

Certain types of learning are possible, respective to each applicable type of learning, only within a limited age range known as a [[critical period]]. Bowlby's concepts included the idea that attachment involved learning from experience during a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment. However, he considered that attachment behaviour was best explained as instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowlby|first=J|title=Attachment and Loss|edition=2nd|volume=Vol. 1.

====Psychoanalysis====
[[Image:Evacuation of Schoolchildren in Japan.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Several lines of school children march diagonally from top right to bottom left. Each carries a bag or bundle and each raises their right arm in the air in a [[salute]]. Adults stand in a line across the bottom right hand corner making the same gesture.|Evacuation of smiling Japanese school children in [[World War II]] from the book ''Road to Catastrophe'']]
[[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytic]] concepts influenced Bowlby's view of attachment, in particular, the observations by [[Anna Freud]] and [[Dorothy Burlingham]] of young children separated from familiar caregivers during World War II.&lt;ref name="anna"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Freud A, Burlingham DT |title=War and children|year=1943 |isbn=978-0-8371-6942-2|publisher=Medical War Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bowlby rejected psychoanalytical explanations for early infant bonds including "[[Drive theory (psychoanalysis)|drive theory]]" in which the motivation for attachment derives from gratification of hunger and libidinal drives. He called this the "[[Cupboard Love|cupboard-love]]" theory of relationships. In his view it failed to see attachment as a psychological bond in its own right rather than an instinct derived from feeding or sexuality.{{sfn|Holmes|1993|p=62–63}} Based on ideas of primary attachment and [[Neo-Darwinism]], Bowlby identified what he saw as fundamental flaws in psychoanalysis: the overemphasis of internal dangers rather than external threat, and the view of the development of personality via linear ''phases'' with [[regression (psychology)|''regression'']] to fixed points accounting for psychological distress. Bowlby instead posited that several lines of development were possible, the outcome of which depended on the interaction between the organism and the environment. In attachment this would mean that although a developing child has a propensity to form attachments, the nature of those attachments depends on the environment to which the child is exposed.{{sfn|Holmes|1993|p=64–65}}

From early in the development of attachment theory there was criticism of the theory's lack of congruence with various branches of psychoanalysis. Bowlby's decisions left him open to criticism from well-established thinkers working on similar problems.&lt;ref name="Steele"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Steele H, Steele M |year=1998|title= Attachment and psychoanalysis: Time for a reunion|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages= 92–119|doi= 10.1111/1467-9507.00053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cass 98"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Cassidy J|year=1998|title=Commentary on Steele and Steele: Attachment and object relations theories and the concept of independent behavioral systems|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages= 120–26|doi= 10.1111/1467-9507.00054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele 98"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Steele H, Steele M |year= 1998|title= Debate: Attachment and psychoanalysis: Time for a reunion|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages=92–119 |doi=10.1111/1467-9507.00053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internal working model====
The philosopher [[Kenneth Craik]] had noted the ability of thought to predict events. He stressed the survival value of natural selection for this ability. A key component of attachment theory is the attachment behavior system. where certain behaviors have a predictable outcome (i.e. proximity) and serve as self-preservation method (i.e. protection). &lt;ref&gt; Cassidy, Jude, et al. “Contributions of Attachment Theory and Research: A Framework for Future Research, Translation, and Policy.” Development and Psychopathology, vol. 25, no. 4pt2, 2013, pp. 1415–1434., doi:10.1017/s0954579413000692.&lt;/ref&gt; All taking place outside of an individuals awareness,  This [[Internal Working Model of Attachment|internal working model]] allows a person to try out alternatives mentally, using knowledge of the past while responding to the present and future. Bowlby applied Craik's ideas to attachment, when other psychologists were applying these concepts to adult perception and cognition.&lt;ref name="JLaird"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johnson-Laird PN |year=1983|isbn=0-674-56881-8 |pages=179–87|title= Mental models| location= Cambridge, MA |publisher= Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infants absorb all sorts of complex social-emotional information from the social interactions that they observe. They notice the helpful and hindering behaviors of one person to another. From these observations they develop expectations of how two characters should behave, known as a "secure base script." These scripts provide as a template of how attachment related events should unfold and they are the building blocks of ones internal working models. &lt;ref&gt; Cassidy, Jude, et al. “Contributions of Attachment Theory and Research: A Framework for Future Research, Translation, and Policy.” Development and Psychopathology, vol. 25, no. 4pt2, 2013, pp. 1415–1434., doi:10.1017/s0954579413000692.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[infant]]'s internal working model is developed in response to the infant's experience based internal working models of self, and environment, with emphasis on the caregiving environment and the outcomes of his or her proximity-seeking behaviors. Theoretically, secure child and adult script, would allow for an attachment situation where one person successfully utilizes another as a secure base from which to explore and as a safe haven in times of distress. In contrast, insecure individuals would create attachment situations with more complications. &lt;ref&gt; Cassidy, Jude, et al. “Contributions of Attachment Theory and Research: A Framework for Future Research, Translation, and Policy.” Development and Psychopathology, vol. 25, no. 4pt2, 2013, pp. 1415–1434., doi:10.1017/s0954579413000692.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, If the caregiver is accepting of these proximity-seeking behaviors and grants access, the infant develops a secure organization; if the caregiver consistently denies the infant access, an avoidant organization develops; and if the caregiver inconsistently grants access, an ambivalent organization develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Main | first1 = M. | last2 = Kaplan | first2 = N. | last3 = Cassidy | first3 = J. | year = 1985 | title = Security in Infancy, Childhood, and Adulthood: A Move to the Level of Representation | url = | journal = Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 66–104 | doi=10.2307/3333827}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retrospect, internal working models are constant with and reflect the primary relationship with our caregivers. Childhood attachment has a direct impact on our adult relationships.

A [[parent]]'s internal working model that is operative in the attachment relationship with her infant can be accessed by examining the parent's mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lieberman|first=AF|year=1997|chapter=Toddlers' internalization of maternal attributions as a factor in quality of attachment|editors=Atkinson, Leslie; Zucker, Kenneth J|title=Attachment and psychopathology|location=New York, NY, US|publisher=Guilford Press|pages=277–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeanah | first1 = CH | last2 = Keener | first2 = MA | last3 = Anders | first3 = TF | year = 1986 | title = Adolescent mothers' prenatal fantasies and working models of their infants | url = | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 49 | issue = 3| pages = 193–203 | doi=10.1080/00332747.1986.11024321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has demonstrated that the quality of maternal attributions as markers of maternal mental representations can be associated with particular forms of maternal psychopathology and can be altered in a relative short time-period by targeted psychotherapeutic intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schechter | first1 = DS | last2 = Moser | first2 = DA | last3 = Reliford | first3 = A | last4 = McCaw | first4 = JE | last5 = Coates | first5 = SW | last6 = Turner | first6 = JB | last7 = Rusconi | first7 = S | last8 = Willheim | first8 = E | year = 2015 | title = Negative and distorted attributions towards child, self, and primary attachment figure, among posttraumatically stressed mothers: What changes with Clinical Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Sessions (CAVES)? | url = | journal = Child Psychiatry and Human Development | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 10–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developments====

In the 1970s, problems with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) rather than as a type of behaviour with organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life.&lt;ref name="Sroufe, Waters, 1977"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sroufe LA, Waters E |year=1977|title= Attachment as an organizational construct|journal= Child Development|volume= 48 |pages=1184–99|doi=10.2307/1128475|issue=4|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|jstor=1128475}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way of thinking saw the secure base concept as central to attachment theory's logic, coherence, and status as an organizational construct.&lt;ref name="WatCum"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Waters E, Cummings EM |title = A secure base from which to explore close relationships|journal = Child Development|volume = 71|issue = 1|pages = 164–72|year = 2000|pmid = 10836570|doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined.&lt;ref name="Tronick"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tronick EZ, Morelli GA, Ivey PK |year=1992|title=The Efe forager infant and toddler's pattern of social relationships: Multiple and simultaneous|journal= Developmental Psychology|volume= 28|pages=568–77|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.4.568|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm.[[Image:Khmerchildren.jpg|thumb|right|alt=On the right a young boy of Asiatic appearance with a pudding basin haircut, leans over a baby lying on its back on the left. The boy and baby are touching noses. The baby gazes up at the boy with an expression of intense interest.|Research indicates that attachment pattern distributions are consistent across cultures, although the manner in which attachment is expressed may differ.]]Selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies.&lt;ref name=ijzsag&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=van IJzendoorn MH, Sagi-Schwartz A |year=2008|title= Cross-Cultural Patterns of Attachment; Universal and Contextual Dimensions|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=880–905|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken; for example [[Kisii people|Gusii]] infants are greeted with a handshake rather than a hug. Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact. There are also differences in the distribution of insecure patterns based on cultural differences in child-rearing practices.&lt;ref name=ijzsag/&gt; The scholar [[Michael Rutter]] in 1974 studied the importance of distinguishing between the consequences of attachment deprivation upon intellectual retardation in children and lack of development in the emotional growth in children.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rutter (1974). ''The Qualities of Mothering''. New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; Rutter's conclusion was that a careful delineation of maternal attributes needed to be identified and differentiated for progress in the field to continue.

The biggest challenge to the notion of the universality of attachment theory came from studies conducted in Japan where the concept of ''[[amae]]'' plays a prominent role in describing family relationships. Arguments revolved around the appropriateness of the use of the Strange Situation procedure where ''amae'' is practiced. Ultimately research tended to confirm the universality hypothesis of attachment theory.&lt;ref name=ijzsag/&gt; Most recently a 2007 study conducted in [[Sapporo]] in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main and Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.&lt;ref name="Behrens"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Behrens KY, Hesse E, Main M |title = Mothers' attachment status as determined by the Adult Attachment Interview predicts their 6-year-olds' reunion responses: a study conducted in Japan|journal = Developmental Psychology|volume = 43|issue = 6|pages = 1553–67|date=November 2007|pmid = 18020832|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "MainCass"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Main M, Cassidy J |year=1988|title=Categories of response to reunion with the parent at age 6: Predictable from infant attachment classifications and stable over a 1-month period|journal= Developmental Psychology|volume= 24|pages= 415–26|doi= 10.1037/0012-1649.24.3.415|issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics in the 1990s such as [[Judith Rich Harris|J. R. Harris]], [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Jerome Kagan]] were generally concerned with the concept of infant determinism ([[nature versus nurture]]), stressing the effects of later experience on personality.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Nurture Assumption]]: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do|pages=1–4|isbn=978-0-684-84409-1 |author=Harris JR|year=1998|location=New York|publisher=Free Press |authorlink=Judith Rich Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pinker"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-14-027605-3|author=Pinker S|title=[[The Blank Slate]]: The Modern Denial of Human Nature|pages=372–99|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|year=2002 |authorlink=Steven Pinker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kagan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kagan J|year=1994|isbn=978-0-674-89033-6 |title=Three Seductive Ideas|location= Cambridge, MA|pages=83–150|publisher= Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on the work on [[temperament]] of [[Stella Chess]], Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was far more important than the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's temperament.&lt;ref name=vbv/&gt; Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups.

Psychoanalysis has recognized the formative nature of a child's early environment including the issue of childhood trauma.

One focus of attachment research has been the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences. Concern with the effects of child care was intense during the so-called "day care wars" of the late-20th century, during which some authors stressed the deleterious effects of day care.&lt;ref name="belsky"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Belsky J, Rovine MJ |title = Nonmaternal care in the first year of life and the security of infant-parent attachment|journal = Child Development|volume = 59|issue = 1|pages = 157–67|date=February 1988|pmid = 3342709|doi = 10.2307/1130397|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|jstor = 1130397}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues, including the need for relationship-building by the assignment of a child to a specific care-giver. Although only high-quality child care settings are likely to provide this, more infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than in the past.{{sfn|Mercer|2006|p=160–63}} A [[natural experiment]] permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families after the end of the [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by [[Michael Rutter]], followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Rutter M|date=January–February 2002| title = Nature, nurture, and development: From evangelism through science toward policy and practice| journal = Child Development| volume = 73| issue = 1| pages = 1–21| pmid = 14717240|doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.&lt;ref name=PPP/&gt;

This social change has made it more difficult for childless people to adopt infants in their own countries. There has been an increase in the number of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources in first-world countries.

 The quality of caregiving received at infancy and childhood directly affects an individuals neurological systems systems which controls stress regulation.&lt;ref name=foxhane/&gt;In psychophysiological research on attachment, the two main areas studied have been [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic response]]s, such as heart rate or respiration, and the activity of the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]].  a system that is responsible for the body's reaction to stress . &lt;ref&gt; Adam EK, Klimes-Dougan B, Gunnar MR.

Recent improvements involving methods of research, have enabled researchers to further investigate the neural correlates of attachment in humans. These advances include identifying key brain structures, neural circuits, neurotransmitter systems, and neuropeptides are all involved in attachment system functioning and can tell us more about a certain individual, even predict their behavior. &lt;ref&gt;Coan JA.

The neural correlates of maternal and romantic love. NeuroImage. 2004;21:1155–1166.&lt;/ref&gt;Another issue is the role of inherited genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of [[Polymorphism (biology)#Genetic polymorphism|polymorphism]] of the gene coding for the [[Dopamine receptor D2|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[dopamine receptor]] has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[serotonin receptor]] with avoidant attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gillath O, Shaver PR, Baek JM, Chun DS |title=Genetic correlates of adult attachment style |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=34 |issue=10 |pages=1396–405 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18687882 |doi=10.1177/0146167208321484 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies show that attachment in adulthood is simultaneously related to biomarkers of immunity.

==Practical applications==
As a theory of [[Developmental psychology|socioemotional development]], attachment theory has implications and practical applications in social policy, decisions about the care and welfare of children and mental health.

===Child care policies===
Social policies concerning the care of children were the driving force in Bowlby's development of attachment theory. The difficulty lies in applying attachment concepts to policy and practice.&lt;ref name=rut08&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Rutter M|title=Implications of Attachment Theory and Research for Child Care Policies|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|year=2008|location=New York and London|publisher=Guilford Press|pages=958–74|isbn=978-1-60623-028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 [[C.H. Zeanah]] and colleagues stated, "Supporting early child-parent relationships is an increasingly prominent goal of mental health practitioners, community-based service providers and policy makers&amp;nbsp;... Attachment theory and research have generated important findings concerning early child development and spurred the creation of programs to support early child-parent relationships."&lt;ref name="BZL"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Berlin L, Zeanah CH, Lieberman AF |title=Prevention and Intervention Programs for Supporting Early Attachment Security|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|year=2008|location=New York and London|publisher=Guilford Press|pages=745–61|isbn=978-1-60623-028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing that early child parent relationships is crucial for child development. You would assume that individuals would be educated on child development and the importance of the early parent-child relationship. However, our current education system is more concerned with sex education rather than healthy relationship tactics and skills needed to parent in a sensitive, responsive manner.  If  Researchers and educators could work together and develop future-parent curriculum for the high school and university levels, It would benefit society as a whole. With the dynamic nature of social and economic environments,  many families struggle balancing work and family responsibilities. Finding quality childcare while at work or school is another issue for many families.NIHD recent study convey that top notch day care contributes to secure attachment relationships in children. &lt;ref&gt; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network.

Westport, CT: Praeger; 2007. pp. 332–346.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations should implement more flexible work arrangements that recognize child care as essential for all its employees. This includes re-examination of parental leave policies. Too many parents are forced to return to work too soon post childbirth because of company policy or financial necessity. No matter the reason this inhibits early parent child bonding.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, Jude, et al. “Contributions of Attachment Theory and Research: A Framework for Future Research, Translation, and Policy.” Development and Psychopathology, vol. 25, no. 4pt2, 2013, pp. 1415–1434., doi:10.1017/s0954579413000692.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, there should be increased attention to the training and screening of childcare workers. In his article reviewing Attachment Theory, Sweeney suggested, among several policy implications, “legislative initiatives reflecting higher standards for credentialing and licensing childcare workers, requiring education in child development and attachment theory, and at least a two-year associate's degree course as well as salary increases and increased stature for childcare positions” &lt;ref&gt; Sweeney GM. Why childhood attachment matters: Implications for personal happiness, families and public policy. In: Loveless S, Homan T, editors. The family in the new millennium. Westport, CT: Praeger; 2007. pp. 332–346.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Historically, attachment theory had significant policy implications for hospitalized or institutionalized children, and those in poor quality daycare.{{sfn|Karen|1998|p=252–58}} Controversy remains over whether non-maternal care, particularly in group settings, has deleterious effects on social development. It is plain from research that poor quality care carries risks but that those who experience good quality alternative care cope well although it is difficult to provide good quality, individualized care in group settings.&lt;ref name=rut08/&gt;

Attachment theory has implications in [[Residence in English family law|residence]] and [[Contact (law)|contact]] disputes,{{sfn|Karen|1998|p=252–58}} and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus focusing on the quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. [[Michael Rutter|Rutter]] noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships.&lt;ref name=rut99&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Rutter M, O'Connor TG |title=Implications of Attachment Theory for Child Care Policies|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|year=1999|location=New York|publisher=Guilford Press|pages=823–44|isbn=1-57230-087-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along with the impact of step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.&lt;ref name=rut08/&gt;

Attachment theory can also inform decisions made in [[social work]], especially in [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic social work]] ([[Microsociology|Petru Stefaroi]]),&lt;ref name="Stefaroi"&gt;Stefaroi, P.

Many researchers in the field were strongly influenced by it.&lt;ref name=rut08/&gt;

===Clinical practice in children===
Although attachment theory has become a major scientific theory of [[Developmental psychology|socioemotional development]] with one of the widest research lines in modern psychology, it has, until recently, been less used in clinical practice.
[[Image:Father and child, Dhaka.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A young father dressed in a pink cotton shirt holds his child and gazes at the camera looking proud but tired. The little girl, wearing a sleeveless dress, sits on her father's arm and frowns directly at the camera.|Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives.]]The attachment theory focused on the attention of the child when the mother is there and the responses that the child shows when the mother leaves, which indicated the attachment and bonding of the mother and the child. The attention therapy is the done while the child is being restrained by the therapists and the responses displayed were noted. The tests were done to show the responses of the child.

This may be partly due to lack of attention paid to clinical application by Bowlby himself and partly due to broader meanings of the word 'attachment' used amongst practitioners. It may also be partly due to the mistaken association of attachment theory with the [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] interventions misleadingly known as "[[attachment therapy]]".&lt;ref name="Ziv"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Ziv Y| title=Attachment-Based Intervention programs: Implications for Attachment Theory and Research|encyclopedia= Enhancing Early Attachments: Theory, Research, Intervention and Policy |series= Duke series in child development and public policy |veditors=Berlin LJ, Ziv Y, Amaya-Jackson L, Greenberg MT |year=2005|publisher= Guilford Press | location=New York and London|isbn= 1-59385-470-6|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevention and treatment====
{{Main|Attachment-based therapy (children)}}
In 1988, Bowlby published a series of lectures indicating how attachment theory and research could be used in understanding and treating child and family disorders. His focus for bringing about change was the parents' internal working models, parenting behaviours and the parents' relationship with the therapeutic intervenor.&lt;ref name=berlinetal&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Prevention and Intervention Programs for Supporting Early Attachment Security|pages=745–61|vauthors=Berlin LJ, Zeanah CH, Lieberman AF |veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |year=2008|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York and London|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing research has led to a number of individual treatments and prevention and intervention programmes.&lt;ref name=berlinetal/&gt; In regards to personal development, children from all the age groups were tested to show the effectiveness of the theory that is being theorized by Bowlby. They range from individual therapy to public health programmes to interventions designed for foster caregivers. For infants and younger children, the focus is on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=231–32}}&lt;ref name="BakermansKranenburg ''et al.'' (2003)"&gt;{{cite early childhood |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=129 |pages=195–215 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.2.195 |pmid=12696839 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An assessment of the attachment status or caregiving responses of the caregiver is invariably included, as attachment is a two-way process involving attachment behaviour and caregiver response. Some programmes are aimed at foster carers because the attachment behaviours of infants or children with attachment difficulties often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses. Modern prevention and intervention programmes have proven successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoffman |first1=Kent T. |last2=Marvin |first2=Robert S. |last3=Cooper |first3=Glen |last4=Powell |first4=Bert | display-authors=etal |date=December 2006 |title=Changing toddlers' and preschoolers' attachment classifications: the Circle of Security intervention |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=1017–1026 |pmid=17154732 |doi=10.1037/0022-006x.74.6.1017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reactive attachment disorder and attachment disorder====
{{Main|Reactive attachment disorder|Attachment disorder}}
One atypical attachment pattern is considered to be an actual disorder, known as ''reactive attachment disorder'' or RAD, which is a recognized psychiatric diagnosis ([[ICD-10]] F94.1/2 and [[DSM-IV-TR]] 313.89). Against common misconception, this is not the same as 'disorganized attachment'. The essential feature of reactive attachment disorder is markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts that begins before age five years, associated with gross pathological care. There are two subtypes, one reflecting a disinhibited attachment pattern, the other an inhibited pattern. RAD is not a description of insecure attachment styles, however problematic those styles may be; instead, it denotes a lack of age-appropriate attachment behaviours that may appear to resemble a clinical disorder.&lt;ref name="Thompson (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thompson RA |title=The legacy of early attachments |journal=Child Development |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=145–52 |year=2000 |pmid=10836568 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "reactive attachment disorder" is now popularly applied to perceived behavioural difficulties that fall outside the DSM or ICD criteria, particularly on the Web and in connection with the pseudo-scientific attachment therapy, "true" RAD is thought to be rare.&lt;ref name="chaffin"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chaffin M, Hanson R, Saunders BE |title=Report of the APSAC task force on attachment therapy, reactive attachment disorder, and attachment problems|journal=Child Maltreatment |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=76–89 |year=2006 |pmid=16382093 |doi=10.1177/1077559505283699|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Attachment disorder" is an ambiguous term, which may be used to refer to reactive attachment disorder or to the more problematical insecure attachment styles (although none of these are clinical disorders). It may also be used to refer to proposed new classification systems put forward by theorists in the field,{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=223–25}} and is used within attachment therapy as a form of unvalidated diagnosis.&lt;ref name="chaffin"/&gt; One of the proposed new classifications, "secure base distortion" has been found to be associated with caregiver traumatization.&lt;ref name=schecter&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schechter DS, Willheim E |title=Disturbances of attachment and parental psychopathology in early childhood |journal=Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=665–86 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19486844 |doi=10.1016/j.chc.2009.03.001 |pmc=2690512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical practice in adults and families===

As attachment theory offers a broad, far-reaching view of human functioning, it can enrich a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment.&lt;ref name="Slade 2008"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author= Slade A|year=2008|title= Attachment Theory and Research: Implications for the theory and practice of individual psychotherapy with adults|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=762–82|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of psychoanalysis-based therapy for adults—within [[relational psychoanalysis]] and other approaches—also incorporate attachment theory and patterns.&lt;ref name="Slade 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sable"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sable P|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7657-0284-5|title= Attachment &amp; Adult Psychotherapy|location= Northvale, NJ|publisher= Aaronson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AuT technologies share many common traits, which justify the common notation.

And they all require unprecedented levels of safety (e.g., [[automobile safety]]) and security,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/01/worried-about-cybersecurity-and-the-connected-car-theres-a-bill-for-that/|title=Worried about cybersecurity and the connected car?

As an example, the [[autonomous car]] both addresses the main existing safety issues and creates new issues. It is expected to be much safer than existing vehicles, by eliminating the single most dangerous element{{snd}}the driver. The US's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates 94 percent of US accidents were the result of [[human error]] and poor decision-making, including speeding and impaired driving,&lt;ref name="moral dilemma"/&gt; and the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School claims that "Some ninety percent of motor vehicle crashes are caused at least in part by human error".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2013/12/human-error-cause-vehicle-crashes |title=Human error as a cause of vehicle crashes |author=Bryant Walker Smith |date=December 18, 2013 |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; So while safety standards like the [[ISO 26262]] specify the required safety, there is still a burden on the industry to demonstrate acceptable safety.

While car accidents claim every year 35,000 lives in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812348 |title=Quick Facts 2015 |work=[[US DOT]] |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1.25&amp;nbsp;million worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gho/road_safety/mortality/en/|title=Road traffic deaths|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; some{{Who|date=August 2017}} believe that even "a car that's 10 times as safe, which means 3,500 people die on the roads each year [in the US alone]" would not be accepted by the public.&lt;ref name="moral dilemma"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/02/20/the-big-moral-dilemma-facing-self-driving-cars/ |title=The big moral dilemma facing self-driving cars |author=Steven Overly |quote="[..] Would we accept that?" asks John Hanson, a spokesman for the Toyota Research Institute, which is developing the automaker's self-driving technology. |date=February 20, 2017 |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptable level may be closer to the current figures on [[aviation accidents and incidents]], with under a thousand worldwide deaths in most years&lt;ref&gt;"Death Rate per Year".

This underscores the unprecedented nature of the safety requirements that will need to be met for cars, with similar levels of safety expected for other Autonomous Things.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14357">The '''basic needs''' approach is one of the major approaches to the measurement of [[absolute poverty]] in developing countries.  It attempts to define the absolute minimum resources necessary for long-term [[physical well-being]], usually in terms of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption goods]].  The [[poverty line]] is then defined as the amount of [[income]] required to satisfy those needs. The 'basic needs' approach was introduced by the International Labour Organization's World Employment Conference in 1976.&lt;ref name="ILO_WEC1976"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/documents/genericdocument/wcms_193047.pdf|format=PDF|title=The World Employment Programme at ILO|access-date=2013-06-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319063854/http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/documents/genericdocument/wcms_193047.pdf|archive-date=2014-03-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ILO1976"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The World Employment Conference: The Enthronement of Basic Needs|author=Richard Jolly|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7679.1976.tb00338.x|journal=Development Policy Review|volume=A9|number=2|pages=31–44|date=October 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Perhaps the high point of the WEP was the World Employment Conference of 1976, which proposed the satisfaction of basic human needs as the overriding objective of national and international development policy. The basic needs approach to development was endorsed by governments and workers’ and employers’ organizations from all over the world. It influenced the programmes and policies of major multilateral and bilateral development agencies, and was the precursor to the human development approach."&lt;ref name="ILO_WEC1976" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ILO1976" /&gt;

A traditional list of immediate "basic needs" is [[food]] (including [[water]]), [[Shelter (building)|shelter]] and [[clothing]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-930390-94-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Denton, John A. |title=Society and the official world: a reintroduction to sociology |publisher=General Hall |location=Dix Hills, N.Y |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-930390-94-5 |oclc= |doi= |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many modern lists emphasize the minimum level of consumption of 'basic needs' of not just food, water, clothing and shelter, but also [[sanitation]], [[education]], [[healthcare]], and [[internet]].  Different agencies use different lists.

The basic needs approach has been described as consumption-oriented, giving the impression "that poverty elimination is all too easy."&lt;ref name=basicneeds1978&gt;{{cite journal|title=Basic Needs and its Critics|author=Dharam Ghai|journal=Institute of Development Studies|volume=9|number=4|pages=16–18|date=June 1978|doi=10.1111/j.1759-5436.1978.mp9004004.x|url=http://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/123456789/10859}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amartya Sen]] focused on 'capabilities' rather than consumption.

In the [[Economic development|development]] discourse, the basic needs model focuses on the measurement of what is believed to be an eradicable level of [[poverty]].  [[Social development|Development programs]] following the basic needs approach do not invest in [[productivity|economically productive]] activities that will help a [[society]] carry its own weight in the future, rather it focuses on allowing the society to consume just enough to rise above the poverty line and meet its basic needs. These programs focus more on subsistence than fairness.  Nevertheless, in terms of "measurement", the basic needs or absolute approach is important.  The 1995 world summit on social development in Copenhagen had, as one of its principal declarations that all nations of the world should develop measures of both absolute and [[relative poverty]] and should gear national policies to "eradicate absolute poverty by a target date specified by each country in its national context."&lt;ref name="urlUnited Nations Division for Sustainable Development- Sustainable Development Issues - Poverty"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/sdissues/poverty/poverty_decisions|title=United Nations Division for Sustainable Development-Sustainable Development Issues - Poverty|accessdate=2008-06-20|publisher=United Nations| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726160118/http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/sdissues/poverty/poverty_decisions| archivedate= 26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==

Professor Chris Sarlo, an [[economist]] at [[Nipissing University]] in [[North Bay, Ontario]], [[Canada]] and a senior fellow of the [[Fraser Institute]], uses [[Statistics Canada]]'s socio-economic databases, particularly the ''Survey of Household Spending'' to determine the cost of a list of household necessities.  The list includes [[food]], shelter, [[clothing]], [[health care]], [[Hygiene|personal care]], [[furniture|essential furnishings]], [[transportation]] and [[communication]], [[laundry]], [[home insurance]], and miscellaneous; it assumes that education is provided freely to all residents of Canada.  This is calculated for various communities across Canada and adjusted for family size.  With this information, he determines the proportion of Canadian households that have insufficient income to afford those necessities. Based on his basic needs [[poverty threshold]], the poverty rate in Canada, the poverty rate has declined from about 12% of Canadian households to about 5% since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fraserinstitute.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=3443 Poverty in Canada: 2006 Update] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521081014/https://www.fraserinstitute.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=3443 |date=May 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in sharp contrast to the results of Statistic Canada, Conference Board of Canada, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and UNESCO reports using the relative poverty measure considered to the most useful for advanced industrial nations like Canada, which Sarlo rejects.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;In 1992 Sarlo argued that the difference between absolute and relative poverty thresholds is artificial since "what is considered to be a necessity depends to some extent on the conditions in the larger society in which one is a member (Sarlo 1992: 19)." In 1992 and again in 2001 Sarlo clarified that the basic needs poverty line is not absolute but relative, since the poverty threshold must be "connected to the society in which people live" but that an "aspect of poverty remains timeless" (Sarlo 2001:11). This is the "irreducible core of necessities invariant through time:"..."water, food, shelter and clothing (Sarlo 1992: 19)" which remains the same through time but the "quantity and quality" are relative to one's society.&lt;/ref&gt;

OECD and UNICEF rate Canada's poverty rate much higher using a relative poverty threshold. Statistics Canada's LICO, which Sarlo also rejects, also result in higher poverty rates. According to a 2008 report by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the rate of poverty in Canada, is among the highest of the OECD member nations, the world's wealthiest industrialized nations.&lt;ref name=OECD2008&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)|year=2008|title=Growing unequal? Income distribution and poverty in OECD countries|location=Paris, France}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no official government definition and therefore, measure, for [[poverty]] in Canada. However, Dennis Raphael, author of ''Poverty in Canada: Implications for Health and Quality of Life''&lt;ref name=povincanada&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cspi.org/books/poverty_canada|author=DennisRaphael Foreword by Rob Rainer and Jack Layton|title=Poverty in Canada: Implications for Health and Quality of Life|publisher=Canadian Scholars Press|date=13 April 2007|isbn=978-1551303239|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=povincanada2011&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cspi.org/books/poverty_canada|author=DennisRaphael Foreword by Rob Rainer and [[Jack Layton]]|title=Poverty in Canada: Implications for Health and Quality of Life|publisher=Canadian Scholars Press|year=2011|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that the [[United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP), the [[UNICEF|United Nations Children’s Fund]] (UNICEF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Canadian poverty researchers&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The Conference Board of Canada "uses the OECD’s relative measure of child poverty, which calculates the proportion of children living in households where disposable income is less than 50 per cent of the median in each country." The Conference Board 2013 cautioned that Canada’s high poverty rate, ranks among the worst of the 17 countries they compared.

==The Philippines==

The Municipality of [[Rosario, Batangas]], [[Philippines]] implemented its Aksyon ng Bayan Rosario 2001 And Beyond Human and Ecological Security Plan using this concept as a core strategy through the ''Minimum Basic Needs Approach to Improved Quality of Life - Community-Based Information System (MBN-CBIS)'' prescribed by the Philippine Government.  This approach helped the municipal government identify priority families and communities for intervention, as well as rationalize the allocation of its social development funds.

==United States==

In the United States, the equivalent measures are called ''self-sufficiency standards'' or ''living income standards''.  Unlike the [[federal poverty level]] (FPL), which is calculated from a single, national variable (cost of food), these models assume that different households have different needs, based on factors such as the number and age of children in the household, and the cost of housing in the particular area (usually a county) that they live in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wowonline.org/pdf/SSS-FAQ.pdf The Self-Sufficiency Standard: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers]&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the principles of basic needs, these measurements do not include any extra money for entertainment, savings, debt payment, or unusual or avoidable expenses, such as vehicle repairs.  It assumes that adults will be working and pay taxes; it also includes costs of all government, charitable, and family subsidies, such as free medical care through [[Medicaid]], free food from the USDA [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] program or a [[food bank]], or free [[childcare]] from a grandparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wowonline.org/ourprograms/fess/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820005813/http://www.wowonline.org/ourprograms/fess/ |archivedate=2008-08-20 |df= }} Family Economic Self-Sufficiency by Diana Pearce at Wider Opportunities for Women&lt;/ref&gt;  All of these costs are ignored by the official FPL measurement, but included in a self-sufficiency standard.

Minimum expenses vary by region.  For housing, child care, food, transportation, health care, and other necessary expenses, plus net taxes, a family in middle-class [[Warren County, Pennsylvania|Warren County]] in northwestern [[Pennsylvania]] of one adult and two children (one preschooler, one school-aged) needed a minimum income of $30,269 to pay its own way in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wowonline.org/ourprograms/fess/state-resources/SSS/The%20Self-Sufficiency%20Standard%20for%20Pennsylvania%202006.pdf The Self-Sufficiency Standard for Pennsylvania 2006] by Diana Pearce, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Child care]] is the largest expense in this budget, followed by housing, taxes, and food.  The same family, living in the wealthy [[King County, Washington|Seattle region]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] would need to earn $48,269 to be self-sufficient while remaining in that location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wowonline.org/ourprograms/fess/state-resources/documents/WASSSfullreport6-29-07.pdf The Self-Sufficiency Standard for Washington 2006] by Diana Pearce, Ph.D&lt;/ref&gt; These figures contrast sharply with the FPL for that year, which was just $16,600 for any three-person household.

The [[New York University]] Large Scale Emergency Readiness Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/ccpr/laser/planc.html Large Scale Emergency Readiness Project]&lt;/ref&gt; applies [[agent-based modelling]] to simulate the effects of a large-scale [[disaster]].  Their initial project focused on modelling a 1998 Brazilian food-poisoning incident involving 8,000 injuries and 16 deaths.

Blast casualty prediction is routinely performed in the planning of [[military operations]].  For example, a [[cruise missile]] attack was considered by the United States in 1998 for [[Tarnak Farms]] in order to kill [[Osama bin Laden]]. However, not enough was known about the [[collateral damage]] effects of cruise missiles on [[Hut (dwelling)|mud huts]].   At the time there were estimated to be 100 women and children in the area, and in order to spare these civilians, the attack was not approved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghost Wars]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cisgenesis''' is a product designation for a category of [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] plants. A variety of [[classification scheme]]s have been proposed&lt;ref name=Nielsen03&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nielsen | first1 = K. M. | title = Transgenic organisms—time for conceptual diversification? | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 227–228 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12610561 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0303-227}}&lt;/ref&gt; that order [[genetically modified organism]]s based on the nature of introduced genotypical changes, rather than the process of genetic engineering.

Cisgenesis (from "same" and "beginning") is one term for organisms that have been engineered using a process in which genes are artificially transferred between organisms that could otherwise be conventionally bred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisgenesis.com/content/view/2/25/lang,english/ Cisgenesis definitions] cisgenesis.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schubert06&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Schubert | first1 = D.| last2 = Williams | first2 = D.| title = 'Cisgenic' as a product designation| journal = Nature Biotechnology| volume = 24| issue = 11| pages = 1327–9| year = 2006| pmid = 17093469| doi = 10.1038/nbt1106-1327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in [[transgenesis]], [[genes]] are only transferred between closely related organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=MacKenzie D |title=How the humble potato could feed the world |journal=New Scientist |volume= |issue=2667 |pages=30–33 |date=2 August 2008 |doi= |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19926671.600-how-the-humble-potato-could-feed-the-world.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while future technologies may allow genomes to be directly edited within an individual organism, currently nucleic acid sequences must be isolated and introduced using the same technologies that are used to produce transgenic organisms. The term was first introduced in 2000 by Henk J. Schouten and Henk Jochemsen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jochemsen H |year=2000|title=Toetsen en begrenzen: een ethische en politieke beoordeling van de moderne biotechnologie |isbn=9072016327}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004 a PhD thesis by Jan Schaart of [[Wageningen University]] in 2004, discussing making [[strawberry|strawberries]] less susceptible to ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]''.

In [[Europe]], currently, this process is governed by the same laws as transgenesis but researchers at Wageningen University in the [[Netherlands]] feel that this should be changed and regulated in the same way as conventionally [[plant breeding#Classical plant breeding|bred plants]]. However, other scientists, writing in [[Nature Biotechnology]], have disagreed.&lt;ref name=Schubert06/&gt; In 2012 the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) issued a report with their risk assessment of cisgenic and intragenic plants. They compared the hazards associated with plants produced by cisgenesis and intragenesis with those obtained either by conventional plant breeding techniques or transgenesis. The EFSA concluded that "similar hazards can be associated with cisgenic and conventionally bred plants, while novel hazards can be associated with intragenic and transgenic plants."&lt;ref&gt;Staff (2012) [https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2561 Scientific opinion addressing the safety assessment of plants developed through cisgenesis and intragenesis] EFSA Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms, Parma, Italy, Retrieved 1 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Cisgenesis has been applied to transfer of natural resistance genes to the devastating disease ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'' in potato&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Park T-H |author2=Vleeshouwers VGAA |author3=Jacobsen E |title=Molecular breeding for resistance to ''Phytophthora infestans'' (Mont.) de Bary in potato (''Solanum tuberosum L.''): a perspective of cisgenesis |journal=Plant Breeding |volume=128 |issue=2 |pages=109–117 |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0523.2008.01619.x |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Apple scab|scab]] (''[[Venturia inaequalis]]'') in apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vanblaere T, Flachowsky H, Gessler C, Broggini GA |title=Molecular characterization of cisgenic lines of apple 'Gala' carrying the Rvi6 scab resistance gene |journal=Plant Biotechnol.

Cisgenesis and transgenesis use artificial [[Horizontal gene transfer|gene transfer]], which results in less extensive change to an organism's genome than [[mutagenesis]], which was widely used before genetic engineering was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Schouten | first1 = H.| last2 = Krens | first2 = F.| last3 = Jacobsen | first3 = E.| title = Do cisgenic plants warrant less stringent oversight?| journal = Nature Biotechnology| volume = 24| issue = 7| pages = 753| year = 2006| pmid = 16841052| doi = 10.1038/nbt0706-753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people believe that cisgenesis should not face as much regulatory oversight as [[genetic modification]] created through transgenesis as it is possible, if not practical, to transfer alleles among closely related species even by traditional crossing. The primary biological advantage of cisgenesis is that it does not disrupt favorable heterozygous states, particularly in asexually propagated crops such as potato, which do not breed true to seed. One application of cisgenesis is to create [[potato blight|blight]] resistant potato plants by transferring known resistance loci wild genotypes into modern, high yielding varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Jacobsen | first1 = E.| last2 = Schouten | first2 = H.

The Dutch government has proposed to exclude cisgenic plants from the European GMO Regulation, in view of the safety of cisgenic plants compared to classically bred plants, and their contribution to durable food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/ministeries/ienm/documenten-en-publicaties/brieven/2014/01/07/brief-aan-eurocommissaris-d-d-18-december-2013-over-nieuwe-veredelingstechnieken-in-de-biotechnologie.html|title=

'''Cognitive neuropsychiatry''' is a growing multidisciplinary field arising out of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[neuropsychiatry]] that aims to understand [[mental illness]] and [[psychopathology]] in terms of models of normal psychological function. A concern with the neural substrates of
impaired cognitive mechanisms links cognitive neuropsychiatry to the basic neuroscience. Alternatively, CNP provides a way of uncovering normal psychological processes by studying the effects of their change or impairment.

The term "cognitive neuropsychiatry" was coined by [[Hadyn Ellis|Prof Hadyn Ellis]] ([[Cardiff University]] ) in a paper "The cognitive neuropsychiatric origins of the Capgras delusion", presented at the International Symposium on the Neuropsychology of Schizophrenia, Institute of Psychiatry, London (Coltheart, 2007).

Although clinically useful, current syndrome classifications (e.g. DSM-IV; ICD-10) have no empirical basis as models of normal cognitive processes. No neuropsychological accounts of how the brain 'works' would ever be complete without a cognitive level of analysis. CNP moves beyond diagnosis and classification to offer a cognitive explanation for established psychiatric behaviours, regardless of whether the symptoms are due to recognised brain pathology or to dysfunction in brain areas or networks without structural lesions.

CNP has been influential, not least because of its early success in explaining some previously bizarre  psychiatric delusions, most notably the [[Capgras delusion]], [[Fregoli delusion]] and other [[delusional misidentification syndrome]]s. The Capgras delusion is "explained as the interruption in the covert route to face recognition, namely affective responses to familiar stimuli, localized in the dorsal route of vision from striate cortex to limbic system. According to standard molecular hypotheses, acute delusions are the result of a dysregulated activity of some neuromodulators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sirgiovanni|first1=Elisabetta|title=Mechanistic Approach to Psychiatric Classification|journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences|date=2009|volume=2|issue=2|pages=45–49|url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-C09-02.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the study of cognitive neuropsychiatry has shown to intersect with the study of philosophy. This intersection revolves around a reconsideration of the mind-body relationship and the contemplation of moral issues that can arise by fields such as neuropsychopathology. For example, it has been under consideration whether or not Parkinson's patients should be held morally accountable for their physical actions. This discussion and study has taken place due to the discovery that under certain circumstances, Parkinson's patients can initiate and control their own movement. Examples such as this are cause for difficult judgement calls, i.e. "about who is mad and who is bad" (Stein 1999). Cognitive neuropsychiatry has also explored the difference between implicit and explicit cognition, especially in catatonic patients. For more information on the bridge between neuropsychiatry and philosophy see (e.g., Stein, Dan (1999). Philosophy, Psychiatry, &amp; Psychology).

'''Computer-aided engineering''' ('''CAE''') is the broad usage of [[computer software]] to aid in [[engineering]] analysis tasks.  It includes {{nowrap|[[finite element analysis]] (FEA)}}, {{nowrap|[[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD)}}, {{nowrap|[[multibody dynamics]] (MBD)}}, [[durability]] and [[optimization]].

== Overview ==
Computer Softwares used to analyse CAD geometry tools that have been developed to support these activities are considered CAE tools. CAE tools are being used, for example, to analyse the robustness and performance of components and assemblies. The term encompasses simulation, [[verification and validation|validation]], and [[Process optimisation|optimisation]] of products and manufacturing tools. In the future, CAE systems will be major providers of information to help support design teams in decision making.  Computer-aided engineering is used in many fields such as automotive, aviation, space, and shipbuilding industries.&lt;ref name=saracoglu /&gt;

In regard to [[information network]]s, CAE systems are individually considered a single [[node (networking)|node]] on a total information network and each node may interact with other nodes on the network.

CAE systems can provide support to businesses. This is achieved by the use of reference architectures and their ability to place information views on the business process. Reference architecture is the basis from which information model, especially product and manufacturing models.

The term CAE has also been used by some in the past to describe the use of computer technology within engineering in a broader sense than just engineering analysis. It was in this context that the term was coined by  '''Jason Lemon''', founder of [[SDRC]] in the late 1970s. This definition is however better known today by the terms [[CAx]] and [[Product Lifecycle Management|PLM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marks|first1=Peter|title=2007: In Remembrance of Dr. Jason A. Lemon, CAE pioneer|url=http://gfxspeak.com/2011/07/08/in-remembrance-of-dr-jason-a-lemon-cae-pioneer/|website=gfxspeak.com|accessdate=2 Jul 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CAE fields and phases ==
CAE areas covered include:
*[[Stress analysis]] on components and assemblies using [[Finite Element Analysis]] (FEA);
*Thermal and fluid flow analysis [[Computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD);
*[[Multibody dynamics]] (MBD) and [[Kinematics]];
*Analysis tools for process simulation for operations such as [[casting]], [[molding (process)|molding]], and die press forming.
*[[Multidisciplinary design optimization|Optimization]] of the product or process.

In general, there are three phases in any computer-aided engineering task:
*Pre-processing &amp;ndash; defining the model and environmental factors to be applied to it. (typically a finite element model, but facet, [[voxel]] and thin sheet methods are also used)
*Analysis solver (usually performed on high powered computers)
*Post-processing of results (using visualization tools)

This cycle is iterated, often many times, either manually or with the use of [[Multidisciplinary design optimization#Commercial MDO Tools|commercial optimization software]].

==CAE in the automotive industry==
CAE tools are very widely used in the [[automotive industry]]. In fact, their use has enabled the automakers to reduce product development cost and time while improving the safety, comfort, and durability of the vehicles they produce. The predictive capability of CAE tools has progressed to the point where much of the design verification is now done using computer simulations (diagnosis) rather than physical [[prototype]] testing. CAE dependability is based upon all proper assumptions as inputs and must identify critical inputs (BJ). Even though there have been many advances in CAE, and it is widely used in the engineering field, physical testing is still a must. It is used for verification and [[Finite element updating|model updating]], to accurately define loads and boundary conditions and for final prototype sign-off.

==The future of CAE in the product development process==
Even though CAE has built a strong reputation as a verification, troubleshooting and analysis tool, there is still a perception that sufficiently accurate results come rather late in the [[design cycle]] to really drive the design. This can be expected to become a problem as modern products become ever more complex. They include [[smart system]]s, which leads to an increased need for multi-physics analysis including [[Control System|controls]], and contain new lightweight materials, to which engineers are often less familiar. CAE software companies and manufacturers are constantly looking for tools and process improvements to change this situation. On the software side, they are constantly looking to develop more powerful solvers, better use computer resources and include engineering knowledge in pre- and post-processing. On the process side, they try to achieve a better alignment between 3D CAE, 1D System Simulation and physical testing. This should increase modeling realism and calculation speed. On top of that, they try to better integrate CAE in the overall [[Product lifecycle|product lifecycle management]]. In this way, they can connect product design with product use, which is an absolute must for smart products. Such an enhanced engineering process is also referred to as [[predictive engineering analytics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van der Auweraer|first1=Herman|last2=Anthonis|first2=Jan|last3=De Bruyne|first3=Stijn|last4=Leuridan|first4=Jan|title=Virtual engineering at work: the challenges for designing mechatronic products|journal=Engineering with computers|date=2012|volume=29|issue=3|pages=389–408|doi=10.1007/s00366-012-0286-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seong Wook Cho|last2=Seung Wook Kim|last3=Jin-Pyo Park|last4=Sang Wook Yang|last5=Young Choi|title=Engineering collaboration framework with CAE analysis data|journal=International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing|date=2011|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39340">In 1975 the Japanese government added a new chapter to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties (1950) to provide for "traditional techniques or craftsmanship that are indispensable to the preservation of cultural property and for which preservation measures shall be taken". Preservation techniques are selected in relation to both [[Tangible Cultural Properties of Japan|tangible]] and [[Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan|intangible]] cultural properties and a holder or preservation body is recognized for each technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/natlaws/media/pdf/japan/japan_law_protectionproperty_entno.pdf |title=Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties (1950, last amendment 2007) |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunkachō"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/pdf/h21_chapter_06.pdf |title=Preservation and Utilization of Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |page=41 |accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Architectural Preservation in Japan |author=Larsen, Knut Einar |publisher=[[ICOMOS]] International Wood Committee |year=1994 |pages=40f |ISBN=82-519-1432-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of the {{nihongo|Selected Conservation Techniques|選定保存技術}}, the government provides funding for and conducts programmes relating to documentation, training, development, promotion and public education. Recognition is thus made and measures taken to combat some of the most serious conservation issues, namely the lack of specialist craftsmen, the loss of knowledge of traditional techniques, and the availability of suitable tools and materials. These issues are of particular relevance in Japan due to the sophistication and inherent susceptibility of much of its art and architecture.&lt;ref name="Bunkachō"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larsen"/&gt;

In [[applied mathematics]], a '''damping matrix''' is a matrix corresponding to any of certain systems of linear ordinary differential equations.  

A '''damping [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]''' is defined as follows.  If the system has ''n'' [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and is under application of ''m'' [[damping]] [[force]]s.

Each [[force]] can be expressed as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;f_{Di}=c_{i1} \dot{u_1}+c_{i2} \dot{u_2}+\cdots+c_{in} \dot{u_n}=\sum_{j=1}^n c_{i,j}\dot{u_j} &lt;/math&gt;

It yields in [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] form;

: &lt;math&gt;F_D=C \dot{U} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''C is the [[damping]] matrix''' composed by the damping coefficients:

: &lt;math&gt;C=(c_{i,j})_{1\le i\le n,1\le j\le m} &lt;/math&gt;

'''''Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes''''' is the third non-fiction book by American author and journalist [[Charles Seife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000O76NFK|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|title =Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes by Charles Seife|accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Decoding+the+universe%3B+how+the+new+science+of+information+is...-a0164405845|publisher=[[thefreelibrary.com]]|title =Decoding the Universe by Charles Seife|accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rhapsodyinbooks.wordpress.com/2009/04/27/review-of-decoding-the-universe-by-charles-seife/|publisher=rhapsodyinbooks.wordpress.com|title = Review of "Decoding the Universe" by Charles Seife|date=April 27, 2009 |first=|last=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was initially published on January 30, 2007 by Viking.

==Synopsis==
In this book Seife concentrates on the [[information theory]], discussing various issues, such as decoherence and probability, relativity and [[quantum mechanics]], works of [[Alan Turing|Turing]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], entropy and superposition, etc.

==Review==
{{quote|The cosmos, as Seife depicts it, is a great big information swap meet. Objects enormous and minuscule are always encountering other objects and being affected by them in such a way that they “gather information” — not consciously, of course, but in the way that the mercury collected information about my boiling syrup. A pool ball that’s hit by another pool ball receives information about the speed and direction of the ball that hit it. [[Subatomic particles]] do the same. Of course, subatomic particles do a lot of things that are much more baffling than this, like existing in two different places at the same time until someone or something tries to locate them. But, as Seife argues, information still lies at the root of all this. “Decoding the Universe” offers a history of the development of information theory, too, beginning with the [[cryptographers]] of World War II.}}

'''Epigraphy''' ({{lang-grc|ἐπιγραφή}}, "inscription") is the study of inscriptions or epigraphs as [[writing]]; it is the science of identifying [[grapheme]]s, clarifying their meanings, classifying their uses according to dates and cultural contexts, and drawing conclusions about the writing and the writers. Specifically excluded from epigraphy are the historical significance of an epigraph as a [[document]] and the artistic value of a [[literature|literary]] composition.

A person using the methods of epigraphy is called an ''epigrapher'' or ''epigraphist''. For example, the [[Behistun inscription]] is an official [[document]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] engraved on native rock at a location in [[Iran]]. Epigraphists are responsible for reconstructing, translating, and dating the trilingual inscription and finding any relevant circumstances. It is the work of [[historian]]s, however, to determine and interpret the events recorded by the inscription as document. Often, epigraphy and history are competences practised by the same person.

An epigraph is any sort of text, from a single grapheme (such as marks on a pot that abbreviate the name of the merchant who shipped commodities in the pot) to a lengthy document (such as a treatise, a work of literature, or a [[hagiography|hagiographic]] prescription). Epigraphy overlaps other competences such as [[numismatics]] or [[palaeography]]. When compared to books, most inscriptions are short. The media and the forms of the graphemes are diverse: [[engraving]]s in stone or metal, scratches on rock, impressions in wax, [[Repoussé and chasing|embossing]] on cast metal, [[cameo (carving)|cameo]] or [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] on precious stones, painting on [[ceramic]] or in [[fresco]]. Typically the material is durable, but the durability might be an accident of circumstance, such as the baking of a [[clay tablet]] in a conflagration.

==Scope==
Epigraphy is a primary tool of [[archaeology]] when dealing with literate cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://f-origin.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/31/files/2014/09/Open-Access-Epigraphy.pdf |title=OPEN-ACCESS EPIGRAPHY.

The study of ancient [[handwriting]], usually in ink, is a separate field, [[palaeography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://people.umass.edu/eng3/fcd/documents/Brown_WhatIsPalaeography.pdf |title=What is Palaeography? |first=Julian |last=Brown |access-date=21 September 2018 |publisher=[[UMassAmherst]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of the writing, the subject of epigraphy, is a matter quite separate from the nature of the text, which is studied in itself. Texts inscribed in stone are usually for public view and so they are essentially different from the written texts of each culture.  Not all inscribed texts are public, however: in [[Mycenaean Greece]] the deciphered texts of "[[Linear B]]" were revealed to be largely used for economic and administrative record keeping. Informal inscribed texts are "[[Graffito (archaeology)|graffiti]]" in its original sense.

==History==
[[File:Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|The high medieval [[Prüfening dedicatory inscription]], composed in [[Latin]] and stamped in [[Roman square capitals]]]]

The science of epigraphy has been developing steadily since the 16th century. Principles of epigraphy vary culture by culture, and the infant science in European hands concentrated on Latin inscriptions at first. Individual contributions have been made by epigraphers such as [[Georg Fabricius]] (1516–1571); [[Stefano Antonio Morcelli]] (1737–1822); [[August Wilhelm Zumpt]] (1815–1877); [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817–1903); [[Emil Hübner]] (1834–1901); [[Franz Cumont]] (1868–1947); [[Louis Robert (historian)|Louis Robert]] (1904–1985).

The ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', begun by Mommsen and other scholars, has been published in Berlin since 1863, with wartime interruptions. It is the largest and most extensive collection of Latin inscriptions. New [[Book|fascicles]] are still produced as the recovery of inscriptions continues. The ''Corpus'' is arranged geographically: all inscriptions from Rome are contained in volume 6. This volume has the greatest number of inscriptions; volume 6, part 8, fascicle 3 was just recently published (2000). Specialists depend on such on-going series of volumes in which newly discovered inscriptions are published, often in Latin, not unlike the biologists' ''[[Zoological Record]]''— the raw material of history.

Greek epigraphy has unfolded in the hands of a different team, with different [[text corpus|corpora]]. There are two. The first is ''Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum'' of which four volumes came out, again at Berlin, 1825-1877. This marked a first attempt at a comprehensive publication of Greek inscriptions copied from all over the Greek-speaking world. Only advanced students still consult it, for better editions of the texts have superseded it. The second, modern corpus is ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' arranged geographically under categories: decrees, catalogues, honorary titles, funeral inscriptions, various, all presented in Latin, to preserve the international neutrality of the field of [[classics]].

Other such series include the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Etruscarum]]'' (Etruscan inscriptions), ''Corpus Inscriptionum Crucesignatorum Terrae Sanctae'' (Crusaders' inscriptions), ''Corpus Inscriptionum Insularum Celticarum'' (Celtic inscriptions), ''Corpus Inscriptionum Iranicarum'' (Iranian inscriptions), "Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia" and "Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period" (Sumerian and Akkadian inscriptions) and so forth.

Egyptian hieroglyphs were solved using the [[Rosetta Stone]], which was a multilingual stele in Classical Greek, Demotic Egyptian and Classical Egyptian hieroglyphs. The work was done by the French scholar, [[Jean-François Champollion]], and the British scientist [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]].

The interpretation of [[Maya hieroglyphs]] was lost as a result of the Spanish Conquest of Central America. However, recent work by Maya epigraphers and linguists has yielded a considerable amount of information on this complex writing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael D.

====Materials====
Inscriptions were commonly incised on stone, marble, metal, [[terracotta]], or wood (though this last material has hardly ever survived, except in [[Egypt]]). In Egypt and [[Mesopotamia]] hard stones were frequently used for the purpose, and the inscriptions are therefore well preserved and easy to read. In [[Greece]] the favourite material, especially in [[Athens]], was white marble, which takes an admirably clear lettering, but is liable to weathering of the surface if exposed, and to wear if rebuilt into pavements or similar structures. Many other kinds of stone, both hard and soft, were often used, especially crystalline [[limestone]]s, which do not easily take a smooth surface, and which, therefore, are often difficult to decipher, owing to accidental marks or roughness of the material.&lt;ref name="EBr1"&gt;The following sections are based on specialist work consulted from the following sources: {{aut|[[Ernest Arthur Gardner]]}}'s article on "Epigraphy and Inscriptions", in Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

The metal most commonly used for inscriptions was [[bronze]]: flat tablets of this were often made for affixing to the walls of temples and other buildings. Occasionally such tablets were made of [[silver]] or [[gold]]; and inscriptions were often incised on vessels made of any of these metals. Inscriptions on metal were nearly always incised, not cast. An important class of inscriptions are the legends on coins; these were struck from the [[die (manufacturing)|die]]. (cf. [[numismatics]].) Clay was very extensively used for inscriptions in Mesopotamia and in [[Crete]]. In this case the symbols were incised or impressed on specially prepared tablets when the clay was soft, and it was subsequently hardened by fire. In Greece, many inscriptions on vases were painted before firing, in that case often having reference to the scenes represented, or incised after firing; potsherds (''[[ostraka]]'') were often used as a cheap writing material. Inscriptions were also often impressed from a mould upon wet clay before firing, in the case of tiles, [[amphora]] handles, etc., and in these cases often supply valuable information as to the buildings to which they belong or the place from which they took their origin.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

The ''tools'' used for making inscriptions varied with the material; most of them were some kind of [[chisel]], usually with a square blade; early inscriptions were sometimes made on hard rock by successive blows with a [[punch (tool)|punch]] or pointed [[hammer]]. Sometimes a circular punch was used for '''''O''''' or a letter of which ''O'' formed a part.

====Styles of cutting====
Early inscriptions, which are often amateur work, are frequently very irregular in their cutting. But in almost all examples of later work, the inscriptions are evidently cut by professionals, and there are definite styles and methods belonging to various places and periods. In Egypt, for instance, the [[hieroglyphs]] are carefully and delicately cut in early times, and in later periods become more careless and conventional. In Greece, the best work was done in the 5th and 4th centuries BC in Athens; the letters were all exact and regular in shape, with no adventitious ornaments, and were, especially in the 5th century, usually exactly aligned with the letters above and below, as well as those on each side. At that time all the strokes were made of equal thickness, but in the 4th century BC and later there came in the custom of holding the chisel obliquely to the surface, thus producing a wedge-shaped stroke. A similar custom in Mesopotamia gave rise to the so-called ''[[cuneiform]]'' system. On metal inscriptions in Greece this same effect appears earlier than stone or marble. In the 3rd century and later it becomes common to introduce ''[[Apex (diacritic)|apices]]'' or ornamental ends to the strokes, a custom which prevails to the present day in our ordinary capital letters. The custom of making different strokes and different parts of curves of varying thickness became common in [[Latin Inscriptions|Roman inscriptions]], which developed a monumental style of their own, varying from period to period. Inscriptions can often be approximately dated by the style of the cutting as well as by the shapes of the letters; skill in doing this can only be acquired by a careful and minute study of originals and facsimiles. (cf. [[dating methodologies in archaeology]].)

Inscriptions vary greatly in size according to the position where they were intended to be read, their purpose, and the skill of the cutter. Some inscriptions are of great length, the longest, a statement of accounts of the temple at [[Delos]], under Athenian administration, being nearly half as long as a book of [[Thucydides]]; and many other inscriptions approach this in length.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Symbols and forms of writing===
{{SpecialChars}}
{{see also|History of writing}}
Most of the forms of writing known to us originated in some system of picture-writing (cf. also [[pictography]], which developed into a hieroglyphic system. Such systems appear to have originated independently in different parts of the world — in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Crete]], among the [[Hittites]] and in [[China]] and [[Americas|America]]. The evidence for all of these is mainly to be found in inscriptions. The development from [[Ideographs]] (or direct representation of an object or idea) to symbols of phonetic value, and so to [[syllabaries]] or alphabets, took place in many different systems to various degrees. But the first people to invent a completely alphabetic system of writing were the [[Phoenicians]], from whom the [[Greeks]] borrowed (some scholars believe, but with no proving) it with certain modifications and improvements. From the Greeks was derived the [[Latin language|Latin]], and from the two all the alphabets of European peoples. It is still a matter of dispute whether the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] was derived from the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]].

[[File:Rökstenen 1.JPG|thumb|An inscription using [[cipher runes]], the [[Elder Futhark]], and the [[Younger Futhark]], on the 9th-century [[Rök Runestone]] in Sweden]]
The hieroglyphic symbols naturally tended to be conventionalised and simplified for convenience of cutting, in accordance with the materials and tools employed. In many cases they developed from a pictorial to a linear form. It is possible that some of these linear forms may not be derived from hieroglyphs, but from purely conventional geometrical forms. such as widely used at all periods and places as owners' or [[Stone mason|masons]]' marks. The tendency of linear forms to become wedge-shaped is most conspicuous in [[cuneiform]], but as has been noticed, the same tendency occurs in Greek inscriptions incised on bronze.

In the north of [[Europe]] the [[Ogham]] [[Ogham inscription|inscriptions]] are alphabetic, and are apparently an independent invention on arbitrary lines, like the [[Morse code]]; but [[Runes]], which were extensively used in the same region, are derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] or the [[Latin alphabet]]s.

In most alphabetic systems there are also found in inscriptions certain symbols which are not strictly alphabetic or phonetic in character. The commonest of these are the various systems of numerals that are used in different times and places. It is impossible here to give any full description of these different systems; but a brief account may be given of the principles underlying them. Most of them are based upon a [[decimal|decimal system]], doubtless owing to the habit of counting on the fingers. In some cases the symbols are simple and obvious, as in the Cretan script, where circles (or ''rhombi''), dots and lines are used for hundreds, tens and units, each being repeated as often as necessary; and a similar system for the lower denominations is used at [[Epidaurus]] in the 4th century BC. In [[Athens]] the usual system was to indicate each denomination by its initial, '''M''' for Μύριοι (10,000), '''X''' for χίλιοι (1,000), '''H''' for εκατόν (100), '''Δ''' for δέκα (10), '''π''' for πεντε (5) and '''I''' for units. The other Greek system followed that derived from the Phoenicians, using the letters of the alphabet in their conventional order from one to nine, 10 to 90 and 100 to 900; in this arrangement obsolete letters were retained in their original places so as to give the requisite number of 27 symbols. The [[Roman numeral|Roman]] system of numerals — M, D, C, L, X, V, I (for 1,000, 500, 100, 50, 10, 5 and 1) is generally supposed to have arisen from the adaptation of those symbols in the Greek alphabet which the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] did not want; an alternative theory is that it is simplified from a series of [[ideograph]]s representing the spread hand, the fingers and so on.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

[[File:Crete - law of Gortyn - boustrophedon.JPG|thumb&lt;!--autosize to fit handheld devices--&gt;|left|Ancient Greek [[boustrophedon]] inscription, [[Gortyn code]], Crete, 5th century BC]]

Apart from numerals, the use of initials in the place of complete words was not common in early times. It became, however, very frequent in Roman inscriptions, which sometimes are made up almost entirely of such abbreviations and can only be understood by those familiar with the formulae. A list of the commonest of these will be found under [[list of classical abbreviations]]. [[Compendia]] or [[monogram]]s also occur in later Greek and Roman times, and become very common and very difficult to interpret in early [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Byzantine]] inscriptions.

Some kind of punctuation is often found in inscriptions of all kinds. In Greek inscriptions a vertical line or a dot, or dots, sometimes indicates the separation between sentences or words, but words are seldom separated by spaces as in modern printing, so that the text is continuous and no division of words exists.This is particularly the case with Greek inscriptions of the best period. In Roman inscriptions it was usual to separate the words by dots. In certain inscriptions a cross ([[File:Greek cross.svg|15px]]) was used to indicate the beginning of an inscription, especially when its direction was erratic. Christian inscriptions sometimes begin with a cross, which doubtless had a symbolic meaning; and a leaf or other device was often placed at the end.

The direction of the writing varies greatly in different places and times. The letters or symbols may be arranged vertically below one another, and read from top to bottom, or horizontally, either from right to left or from left to right; they may also be arranged in a kind of pattern — in which case their order may be indeterminate, or in a wandering or curved line, or left to right and right to left alternately (''[[boustrophedon]]'', or as an [[ox]] in [[ploughing]]). Most [[Semitic alphabets]], including Phoenician, read from right to left; and the earliest Greek inscriptions follow the same direction. But the direction from left to right became regular in Greece after the 6th century BC, and consequently is adopted by the Romans and in all European systems. The individual letters or symbols usually face in the same direction as the writing, as a whole.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Position or place===

The position or place of inscriptions depends greatly upon their purpose or intention. When they have a direct relation to the sculptures, reliefs or paintings with which they are associated, they often form a kind of pattern to fill the background or vacant spaces between the figures; but sometimes, especially in Mesopotamian statues or reliefs, they are cut right across the figures without any regard to the artistic effect. In late Greek or Roman work it is usual to cut any inscription relative to a statue or relief upon the basis on which this is mounted; but short inscriptions such as dedications or artists' signatures are often placed in some inconspicuous position upon the work itself. In the case of painted vases, the inscriptions relative to the subject represented are usually painted; but dedications and other inscriptions are often incised after the vase has been fired.

In Egypt, inscriptions were often inscribed or painted upon inner walls of tombs, whether they referred to religious belief or ritual, or to the honours and possessions of the deceased; they were intended for his benefit and convenience rather than for the information of others, so as to perpetuate his familiar surroundings, not to make him live in the memory of his successors. The information which we derive from such inscriptions is invaluable to us; but such was not the intention with which they were made. On the other hand, inscriptions which were intended to be seen by the public and to perpetuate a record of events, or to supply useful information, were usually placed in places of common resort, above all in temples and sacred precincts. Sometimes they were cut on convenient rock faces, sometimes upon the walls of temples or other buildings. Most frequently the slabs of marble (''[[stelae]]''), stone metal or other material upon which the inscriptions were incised were set up in convenient positions to be read, in any places of public resort. This was the method of publication of all laws, decrees and official notices, of treaties and contracts, of honours to officials or private citizens, of religious dedications and prescriptions of ritual. Inscribed [[tombstone]]s were set up over graves, which were usually placed along the chief roads leading out of a town, the most familiar example being the sacred way from Athens to [[Eleusis]]. Inscriptions commemorative of victories or other great events were only in exceptional cases erected upon the spot; more often such memorials were set up in some great religious centre such as [[Delphi]] or [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. But boundary stones were necessarily placed on the line which they defined.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Chief periods and nationalities===
[[File:Cypriot syllabic inscription 600-500BC.jpg|thumb]]
The study of inscriptions supplies an important contribution to the history of many lands and peoples. In some cases, as in Egypt and Mesopotamia, it forms almost the only source of information in the absence of literary records; in others, as in Greece and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], it offers a most valuable supplement and comment to what is otherwise recorded.

Both Egyptian and Mesopotamian inscriptions go back to an extremely early date; it is at present uncertain which is the earlier, but both show, before 3500 BC and possibly much earlier, a complete, organised system of writing which implies many centuries of development behind it. The Egyptian hieroglyphic system, as used in inscriptions, continued without any essential change of character until Roman times, though various systems of [[hieratic]] modification were used at different times. On the famous [[Rosetta Stone]], in the [[British Museum]], which first gave the clue to the interpretation of Egyptian writing, hieroglyphic, hieratic and Greek versions of the same decree are given side by side. Its date is 195 BC. The Mesopotamian linear symbols developed mainly for technical reasons, into a wedge-shaped or cuneiform system, which was adopted in modified forms and applied to different languages through some thousands of years, [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], [[Assyria]]n and [[Old Persian|Persian]], until it was superseded, after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], by Greek. An independent hieroglyphic system, which also developed into various linear scripts, existed in Crete during the [[Middle Minoan|Middle]] and [[Late Minoan]] periods, from about 3000, probably, to the fall of [[Knossos]], about 1500 BC. The Hittite hieroglyphs correspond to the period of the Hittite empire in northern [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Asia Minor]] from about 2000 to 800 BC; from it, according to one theory, arose the [[Cypriot syllabary]], which continued in use until the 4th century BC or later.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

The earliest Phoenician inscriptions known date from about the 10th century BC, and the alphabet remained in use down to the 3rd century BC. Some believe this  was modified and adopted by the Greeks at an uncertain date; the earliest Greek inscriptions are generally dated in the 7th century BC.

In early times each Greek State had its own alphabet; but in the year 403 BC (the [[archon]]ship of [[Eucleides]]) the [[Ionic Greek|Ionian alphabet]], which is the one used now for Greek capital letters, was officially adopted by [[Athens]], and soon became universal in Greece. From the various Greek alphabets the different local [[Italian alphabet]]s, including the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], were derived with various modifications. The [[Roman alphabet]] was among these, being based on the [[Archaic Greek alphabets|alphabet]] of [[Caere]], a [[Chalcis|Chalcidian]] colony. There are a few very early Roman inscriptions; but they do not become common until the 3rd century BC; from that time the letters took much the same forms as they preserve to the present day.

The custom of putting inscriptions in Greek and in Latin on buildings and other monuments continued through [[medieval]] times, and is still customary, classical forms being frequently imitated. The latest dated inscription in the ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae|Greek Corpus]]'' records the building of a bridge in [[Sicily]] in AD 1121. The series of Byzantine inscriptions continues practically without interruption to the present day; and Latin retains its use as a universal language in religious, public and private inscriptions.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Methods of dating===
{{main article|Dating methodologies in archaeology}}
It is often possible to date an inscription approximately by the style of the lettering, or even by the alphabet used. Thus at Athens the [[Ionic alphabet]] was adopted in place of the early [[Attic Greek|Attic alphabet]] in the archonship of [[Eucleides]], 403 BC, according to a decree proposed by [[Archinus]].{{r|fragment}} But the change was already in process in private inscriptions, and even in official documents Ionic forms are sometimes found earlier. Inscriptions are dated in various ways, mostly by giving the name of a king, magistrate or priest. In the case of kings, they only give an approximate date, unless the year of his reign is given also. But in the case of most independent cities, the date is given by the name of an annual magistrate, and thus the year is precisely indicated. At Athens, the name used was that of the [[Eponymous]] [[Archon]], and as an almost complete list of these has been drawn up from inscriptions and other sources, this means of dating is quite satisfactory. The custom of dating by [[Olympiads]], which is familiar to us from later Greek and Roman writers, was rarely used in early Greece, except in connection with athletic victories. Many inscriptions are dated from various local eras, often based upon historical events, such as the foundation of a town or festival, the organisation of a province, or even a visit of an [[emperor]]. The number of these eras in later times, especially in Asia Minor, becomes very bewildering. In Attic decrees, and some others, it was also usual to give the day of the month.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

In Greek inscription of the Roman period the year of the emperor is defined by the number of his [[consulate]], or other indications or titles, as in the corresponding Latin inscriptions. In later times, the dating is commonly by "Indiction"; but as this only gives the number of the year within the 15-year period, but leaves that period undefined, such dating is very inconvenient except for merely temporary use. In the [[Eastern Empire]] the date from the creation of the world (5509 BC) is sometimes given; but the date of the Christian era is hardly ever used.

[[File:Roman-mosaic-know-thyself.jpg|thumb| Inscription on a Roman [[mosaic]] from excavations in the [[Appian Way]], [[Rome]]. The Greek motto ''gnōthi sauton'' ("know thyself", ''nosce te ipsum'') combines with the image to convey the famous warning: ''Respice post te; hominem te esse memento; [[memento mori]]'' (Look behind; remember that you are mortal; remember death)]]

===Purpose of inscriptions===
Inscriptions may be roughly divided into two main classes: those in which the inscription was subservient to the use or purpose of the object on which it was inscribed, or at any rate had a direct relation to that object — for example, the name of the owner or the record of dedication to a god — and those in which the inscription existed independently for its own sake, or for the sake of the information which it recorded, and the object on which it was inscribed was either made for the purpose, as a slab of marble or plate of bronze, or was made use of, as in the case of a convenient wall or the surface of a rock, or even a [[potsherd]]. The walls of buildings are often covered with such inscriptions, especially if they are in a conspicuous or convenient position, and so offer an obvious means of publicity.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

For us, accustomed as we are to a vast mass of books, newspapers and other printed or digital documents, it is difficult to realise the extensive use and great convenience assigned to inscriptions in ancient times. Not only were public announcements of all sorts, such as we should make known by [[advertisements]] or [[posters]], thus placed before the public, but all kinds of records and enactments — [[codes of law]] and political decrees; regulations for all matters, civil and religious; accounts and contracts, public and private; treaties between states; records of public and private benefactions and dedications, and all matters of administration; honours to the living and to the memory of the dead. Many of these were intended to preserve for all time the records which they contained; but others must have been of only temporary interest. It seems, therefore, the more remarkable that they should have been incised on permanent material such as bronze, marble or stone — and incised in the first instance, with a care and perfection of technique which have led to their survival to the present day, so as to preserve for us invaluable evidence as to the life and institutions of the people who made them. Temporary and permanent value are therefore often combined in the same inscription. For instance, any Athenian citizen, visiting the [[Acropolis]] or the [[Agora]], could satisfy themselves at first hand as to treaties or decrees of the people, public accounts or state income and expenditure. And at the same time these documents preserved for all time much history, both social and political.&lt;ref name=InternationalDictionary&gt;{{cite book |author1=Trudy, Robert |author2=Sharon, Ring |author3=Salkin, Boda |year=1996 |title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe |location= |publisher=Routledge |pages= 66 |isbn=978-1-884964-02-2 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative inscriptions===
[[File:Periander Pio-Clementino Inv276.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bust of [[Periander]] bearing the inscription "Periander, son of [[Cypselus]], [[Corinth]]ian". Marble, Roman copy after a Greek original by [[Kresilas]], 4th century]]
Inscriptions having a direct relation to the object, or representation, on which they are inscribed, vary greatly in their contents. Those relating to [[picture]] or [[relief]] chronicles of the victories or exploits of kings, as in Egypt and Mesopotamia, serve as a record of the events, and help to interpret the scenes. Such inscriptions are not common in Greek or Roman work; but frequently, especially in early Greek times, and on vases, the names of persons and even of objects are written beside them for the purpose of identification, and sometimes a speech issues from the mouth of the figure. On the carved wooden chest of [[Cypselus]], of about 600 BC [[hexameter]] verses were written, curving about among figures, and giving a description of each scene. The bases of statues and reliefs often had inscriptions cut upon them for identification and record. This was particularly the case with honorary statues and tombstones. In other cases, where there is an evident relation between the artistic representation and the inscription, the figures are subordinate and seem merely to illustrate the text, as when a treaty between Athens and [[Samos]] has a relief at its head representing the [[goddess]] [[Athena]] and [[Hera]] clasping hands, as representatives of their respective cities. In other cases, the arms or device of a city is carved on an inscription, almost like a seal on a document. In all these cases the figures and the inscription are part of a common design, whether carried out by the same hand or not. But in the case of owners' marks or names cut on vases or other objects, or of the dedication of such objects, the inscription is not necessarily contemporary; it may indeed be misleading, as in the case, mentioned with disapproval by [[Cicero]], of using again old Greek statues and placing new dedicatory inscriptions on them in Roman times, a sort of "recycling": for instance, one of the statues of Athenian knights of the 5th century BC placed at the entrance of the Acropolis, had a later inscription cut on its base to make it serve as an equestrian statue of [[Germanicus]], probably in 18 AD when he visited Athens. In Egypt and Mesopotamia also it is not unusual to find the name of a later king of official cut upon an earlier work.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the [[Cicero]] reference cf. {{cite book |author=Margherita Guarducci   |authorlink=Margherita Guarducci |year=1995 |title=Epigrafia greca |location=Rome |publisher=Ist. Poligrafico dello Stato |pages= 87ff |isbn= |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent inscriptions===
The majority of inscriptions are of independent value and interest, the object on which they are cut being either provided for the purpose or utilised as convenient and suitable. Such inscriptions may be classified as ''(a) Religious'' and ''(b) Political and Social''. The distinction between the two is not always easy to draw; for in almost all ancient civilisations religion was a part of the established service of the State, and was under public control, or at least was closely bound up with political administration. It follows that many inscriptions relating to religious matters take the form of political decrees or state documents, and therefore might, especially as far as form is concerned, be included in either category; but it is usually possible to classify them according to their contents and intention.

====Temples, their foundation and administration====
A [[temple]] was often a kind of religious corporation under the control of the State; and its accounts and details of administration were made public at frequent intervals, usually annually, by means of inscriptions, exhibited to public view in its precinct. Many such inscriptions have been found, and supply a great deal of information that can be obtained from no other source. Some great temples, such as that of [[Apollo]] on the island of [[Delos]], held great amounts of property, both real and portable, the latter taking the form either of more or less precious offerings dedicated in the temple and its surrounding buildings, or of coined money. The inscriptions accordingly record gifts and acquisitions of landed property, leases and assignments, payments of rent and fines for default, loans and interest and many other business transactions suitable to a great landed proprietor or to a bank. They therefore throw much light upon the social and economic conditions of ancient life, such as are nowhere else recorded. Again, the lists of offerings dedicated in the temple and other buildings enable us to realise almost visually the appearance of their contents. These are described as being on the floor, on the walls, on shelves or in cases; they consisted of vases and other objects suitable for use in the temple service; ornaments and jewels; statuettes, mostly in gold and silver; weapons and tools; coined money; and [[bullion]], mostly melted down from old offerings. The detailed care that was taken in this last case, to ensure that the full weight of these objects was preserved, whether made into a new vessel or not, is recorded in other inscriptions. These elaborate inventories were checked and revised by each successive board of administrators, and gave the best possible security against any robbery or [[peculation]]. In addition to such general lists, there are also innumerable records of various gifts and acquisitions, whether of land and houses, or of movable property of all sorts. Buildings and repairs are also recorded, sometimes by the State, sometimes by individuals, whose piety and generosity are suitably honoured. In form, these are often hardly to be distinguished from public works of a secular character, which must be mentioned later.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2006"/&gt;

The inscriptions on or belonging to special dedications are often of great historical interest — there need only be quoted the inscription on the famous [[Serpent Column]], once at [[Delphi]] and now in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], with the list of the Greek States which took part in the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian War]]; and that relating to the Roman arms dedicated by [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] at [[Dodona]] after his victories. Most of the great temples being of immemorial sanctity, it is hardly to be expected that any records of their foundation should be found in inscriptions. But on the other hand we have many accounts of the dedication of new temples, either by states or communities or by private individuals. In almost all such cases it was necessary to obtain sanction for the foundation from the State; thus the inscription often takes the form of a decree of the people authorising the foundation of the temple and often giving some privileges to the founder or founders.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Priests and other officials====
[[File:KaranisSouthTempleGreekInscr.jpg|thumb|Greek inscription at the south temple, [[Karanis|Kom Aushim (Karanis)]], [[Faiyum]], [[Egypt]]]]
Inscriptions give much information as to priests and other religious officials. There are in the first place lists of priests, some of them covering long periods and even going back to mythical times; there are also lists of treasures and administrators, who were usually lay officials appointed for the purpose, either by election or by lot. The duties and privileges of priests are recorded in many inscriptions, and vary considerably from place to place. It is recorded, for instance, what portions of a victim at any sacrifice were to be received by the priest. In any important temple this must evidently have been far more than the priest or his family could consume, and accordingly it must have been sold, and so constituted a considerable source of income. Consequently, a [[priesthood]] was an office well paid and much sought after; and we actually find in later Greek times, especially in Asia Minor, that priesthoods were frequently sold, under proper guarantees and with due sureties as to the duties being carried out. Sometimes a fee to the priest had to be paid in cash; in some cases a priest or priestess was allowed to take up a collection on certain days. On the other hand, the duties of a priest are often recorded; he had to see to the cleaning and care of the temple and its contents, to provide flowers and garlands for decorations and to supply the regular daily service. Sacrifices on great occasions were usually provided by the State, as also were important repairs; but in some cases a priest undertook these on his own account, and was honoured accordingly — for instance, by being allowed to inscribe his name in the restored temple.

Besides priests, we find many other officials of various ranks attached to temples and recorded in inscriptions. Some of these, especially those who were concerned with buildings or constructions, or with the inventories of temple treasures and the accounts of administration, were lay officials appointed by the State, as in the case of political officers. But many others had specialised sacerdotal functions; for instance, in many places there were ''[[manteis]]'' or prophets, often of special families with hereditary skills in [[divination]]; at [[Eleusis]] we find records of the [[hierophant]], the torch-bearer, and others who took part in the celebration of the mysteries. At Olympia, in later Greek times, we find a remarkable list of officials, that is: three priests, three libation pourers, two prophets, three custodians (of keys), a flute-player, an interpreter, a priest for the daily sacrifice, a secretary, a wine-pourer, three dancers at libations, a woodman (to supply wood for the sacrifices), and a steward and cook — the last no sinecure, in view of the numerous sacrificial feasts.

There were also many more menial offices in the service of temples which were carried out by slaves. Such slaves were often presented to the temple or acquired in some other way. There is a whole class of inscriptions, found on many sites, in which the sale of slaves to a temple or to the god of a temple is recorded. It is often difficult to know whether such slaves were intended for the service of a temple, or, on the other hand, such service was either purely formal or was not required at all, the sale to the temple being intended as fictitious, so as to enable a slave to acquire his own freedom and at the same time to secure the protection of the god in his free status.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Ritual====
[[File:Votive relief Asklepios BM809.jpg|thumb|Votive relief for the cure of a bad leg, inscription from the shrine of [[Asclepius]] at [[Milos]], [[Ægean Sea]].]]

The ritual appropriate to different divinities and temples varied greatly from place to place; and it was, therefore, necessary or desirable to set up notices in all public places of worship for the information and guidance of worshippers. The commonest and most essential act of worship was sacrifice; an example of the simplest form of prescription is to be seen in the inscription on the relief from [[Thasos]] in the [[Louvre]]:— "To the [[Nymphs]] and to Apollo the leader of the Nymphs, the worshipper may, if he so choose, sacrifice a male and a female victim. It is not permissible to offer a sheep or a pig. No [[paean]] is sung. To the [[Graces]] it is not permissible to offer a goat or a pig."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Louvre%20Ma%20696&amp;object=Sculpture Louvre Ma 696 (Sculpture)], ''Relief Plaques from Thasos''; see also classification on [http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/4DLink3/4DACTION/LSAGwebDisplayInscription?searchTerm=Relief&amp;searchType=browse&amp;searchField=object&amp;returnList=0&amp;sequence=0&amp;thisListPosition=8 Poinikastas:"Thasos, inscriptions"] - IG vol. xii.8 no. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is to be noticed that this order of service contains a prohibition as well as a prescription. Such prohibitions are frequent, and often relate to the need of ceremonial purity in all worshippers entering a sacred precinct. They must for a certain time have abstained from certain prescribed means of pollution, varying from place to place. The officials are sometimes ordered to erect notices giving information on this point; for instance, at the precinct of [[Alectrona]] at [[Ialysus]], it was prescribed that "no horse, ass, mule, nor any other animal with a bushy tail should enter, and that nobody should bring such animals in or wear shoes or any article produced from pigs. There is also a fine for driving in sheep."&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt; Other precincts were protected in a more general manner from any invasion or violation. It was prohibited to cut wood or to remove earth and stones, or to drive any beasts into some precincts; the right of erecting booths was either restricted or denied altogether. Sometimes more detailed prescriptions are given for the whole organisation of a festival; thus, at [[Andania]], in [[Messenia]], the arrangements for the celebration of the local [[Eleusinia]], the dress of the participants, the officials and policing, are very fully described. Similarly, in the Hall of the Iobacchi, at Athens, the order of proceedings, the officers and the characters in the sacred play, and various administrative details are ordered.&lt;ref name="GEpi"&gt;Cf. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ECc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;dq=hall+of+the+Iobacchi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bUASHSU5ET&amp;sig=7bVtQ6GblyM1sojunQokSFuWsp0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bddVUd6wKafI0QWx2YGABA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hall%20of%20the%20Iobacchi&amp;f=false ''An Introduction to Greek Epigraphy''], Cambridge University Press - (undated, no author cited)Googlebook; see also [https://books.google.com/books?id=tTUFC3S-7r4C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=hall+of+the+Iobacchi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LWja_v4xvP&amp;sig=d2eJ6F9VifPiDz35NlU7PXqzFbg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bddVUd6wKafI0QWx2YGABA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hall%20of%20the%20Iobacchi&amp;f=false ''Ancient Athens''], Haskell House Publ., 1902 (no author cited) Googlebook&lt;/ref&gt;

When there is any doubt about any ritual or procedure, divination is often resorted to, and the results of such divination are recorded in inscriptions as a guidance for the future; it was also a common practice to consult Delphi or some other [[oracle]] in doubtful or difficult cases; there the exact method of procedure is sometimes recorded, as well as the response of the oracle. Forms of worship are often prescribed or recorded, especially hymns, which are sometimes inscribed together with their musical notation. The performance of songs or hymns and dances are also matters of constant reference, especially in connection with lyrical or musical contests; the victorious band or performer often dedicated the prize in honour of the god. A special form of contest was that in dramatic performances, of which many records have survived, both from Athens and from many other parts of the Greek world. The regulation of athletic festivals, and the records of victors in their contests, also form a numerous class of inscriptions. As regards mysteries, though there are numerous regulations affecting the arrangement of celebrations and the conduct of those participating, there is, as was to be expected, very little concerning the actual performances.

Another interesting phase of Greek religion known to us mainly from inscriptions is offered by the shrines of healing. The most notable of these is the precinct of [[Asclepius]] at [[Epidaurus]]. Here have been found, on large slabs of inscription, compiled, in all probability, from earlier documents, lists of the cures effected by Apollo and Asclepius. The cures are of the most varied kinds, from painful diseases or surgical cases to a lost boy and a broken cup. The formula is in almost all cases the same: the consultant come to Epidaurus, sleeps in the ''[[Epidaurus|abaton]]'', has dreams or sees visions, and comes out whole. In later times, when such faith-healing had probably become less efficacious, elaborate prescriptions of diet and hygiene are recorded.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2006"/&gt;

A special form of prayer consists of curses, which were often buried in the ground, probably with the intent to reach the infernal gods. Such curses often give the reason for their being made, usually some injury done to the author of the curse; sometimes they devote the offender to the infernal gods.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Private associations for religious purposes====
Another elements in Greek religion which is known to us almost exclusively by means of inscriptions, is to be found in the religious associations that existed in many Greek cities, apart from the organisation of state religion, though sometimes recognised by it. These associations had each its own regulations, which were duly recorded in inscriptions; they varied greatly both in purpose and in character. Many of them had a definitely religious purpose, in the worship of certain gods; sometimes an alien community was given special permission to worship its own god or gods in its own way. Other associations were more social in character and served as clubs, or as burial societies. A remarkable feature about such associations is that the lists of members of many of them include the names of women and of slaves, thus contrasting with the civic basis of established religion in Greece, and anticipating a religion in which "there can be neither [[Jew]] nor [[Greek people|Greek]], there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female."&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#3:28|Galatians 3:28]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and social===

====Codes of law and regulations====
Ancient writers state that the earliest laws of Athens were inscribed upon tablets of wood, put together in a pyramidal shape. These, owing to their material, have perished; but we have some very early [[codes of law]] preserved on stone, notably at [[Gortyna]] in Crete. Here an inscription of great length is incised on the slabs of a theatre-shaped structure in 12 columns of 50 lines each; it is mainly concerned with the law of inheritance, adoption, etc. Doubtless similar inscriptions were set up in many places in Greece. An interesting series of inscriptions deals with the conditions under which colonists were sent out from various cities, and the measures that were taken to secure their rights as citizens. A bronze tablet records in some detail the arrangements of this sort made when [[Locrians]] established a colony in [[Naupactus]]; another inscription relates to the Athenian colonisation of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], in the 6th century BC.

====Decrees of people and rulers, later of kings and emperors====
A very large number of inscriptions are in the form of decrees of various cities and peoples, even when their subject matter suggests that they should be classified under other headings. Almost all legislative and many administrative measures take this form; often a decree prescribes how and where the inscription should be set up. The formulae and preambles of such decrees vary considerably from place to place, and from period to period. Those of Athens are by far the most exactly known, owing to the immense number that have been discovered; and they are so strictly stereotyped that can be classified with the precision of algebraic formulae, and often dated to within a few years by this test alone. Very full lists for this purpose have been drawn up by epigraphist Wilhelm Larfeld, in his work on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. his classic work (downloadable) [https://archive.org/details/griechischeepigr00larf ''Griechische Epigraphik'' (1914)] at [[University of Toronto]] - Robarts Library, eBook.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usual to record the year (by the name of the eponymous archon), the day of the month and of the [[prytany]] (or presiding commission according to tribes), various secretaries, the presiding officials and the proposer of the decree. It is also stated whether the resolution is passed by the senate ([[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule]]) or the assembly of the people ([[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]]), or both. The circumstances or the reason of the resolution are then given, and finally the decision itself. Some other cities followed Athens in the form of their decrees, with such local variations as were required; others were more independent in their development, and different magistracies or forms of government had various results. In the [[Hellenistic Age]], and later, the forms of independent government were, to a great extent, kept up, though little real power remained with the people. On the other hand, it is common thing to find letters from kings, and later from [[Roman emperors]], inscribed and set up in public places.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Public accounts, treasure lists, building inscriptions====
It was customary to inscribe on stone all records of the receipt, custody and expenditure of public money or treasure, so that citizens could verify for themselves the safety and due control of the State in all financial matters. As in the case of temple accounts, it was usual for each temporary board of officials to render to their successors an account of their stewardship, and of the resources and treasures which they handed over. In all cases of public works, the expenditure was ordered by the State, and detailed reports were drawn up and inscribed on stone at intervals while the work was being carried out. In many cases there is a detailed specification of building work which makes it possible, not only to realise all the technical details and processes employed, but also the whole plan and structure of a building. A notable instance is the [[arsenal]] of [[Philon]] at the [[Peiraeus]] which has been completely reconstructed on paper by architects from the building specification.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phil"&gt;Built under the administration of [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]], {{cite book|author=Smith, Sir William, ed.|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology|chapter=Philon, A very eminent architect at Athens|year=1859|volume=vol. III|location=Boston|publisher=Little, Brown, and Company|page= 314|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314}}. E. A. Gardner, ''op.cit.'' p. 557, observes that it "is perhaps known to us more in detail than any other lost monument of antiquity." It was to hold the rigging of the [[galley]]s; and was so contrived that all its contents were visible from a central hall, and so liable to the inspection of the Athenian [[democracy]]. Philon's arsenal was destroyed by the forces of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in the [[First Mithridatic War#Sulla's siege of Athens, summer 87-early 86 BC|Roman conquest of Athens in 86 BC]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the [[Erechtheum]], we have not only a detailed report on the unfinished state of the building in 409 BC, but also accounts of the expenditure and payments to the workmen employed in finishing it. Similar accounts have been preserved of the building of the [[Parthenon]], spread over 15 years; in the case of both the Parthenon and the Erechtheum, there are included the payments made to those who made the sculptures.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Jenkins   |title=Greek Architecture And Its Sculpture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLego4eAgZUC|accessdate=29 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02388-8|pages=118–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jeffrey M. Hurwit   |title=The Athenian Acropolis: History, Mythology, and Archeology from the Neolithic Era to the Present |year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-42834-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval and military expenditure is also fully accounted for; among other information there are records of the [[galley]]-slips at the different harbours of the Piraeus, and of the ships of the Athenian navy, with their names and condition. In short, there is no department of state economy and financial administration that is not abundantly illustrated by the record of inscriptions.&lt;ref name="Phil"/&gt; A set of records of high historical value are the ''"tribute lists"'', recording the quota paid to Athens by her [[Members of the Delian League|subject allies]] during the 5th century BC. These throw much light on her relations with them at various periods.(Cf. [[Delian League]]).

[[File:Stele with an ephebic list NAMA 1484 (DerHexer).JPG|thumb|[[Stele]] with an [[ephebos|ephebic]] list, Athens, 4th century BC]]

====Ephebic inscriptions====
An institution as to which our knowledge is mainly derived from inscriptions is the [[ephebos|ephebic system]] at Athens. There are not only records of lists of [[ephebos|ephebi]] and of their guardians and instructors, but also decrees in honour of their services, especially in taking their due part in religious and other ceremonies, and resolutions of the ephebi themselves in honour of their officials. It is possible to trace in the inscriptions, which range over several centuries, how what was originally a system of physical and military training for Athenian youths from age of 18 to 20, with outpost and police duties, was gradually transformed. In later times there were added to the instructors in military exercises others who gave lectures on what we should now call arts and science subjects; so that in the Hellenistic and Roman times, when youths from all parts of the civilised world flocked to Athens as an intellectual centre, the ephebic system became a kind of cosmopolitan university.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=O. W. Reinmuth   |title=The Ephebic Inscriptions of the Fourth Century B.C. |url= |accessdate= |year=1971 |publisher=Leiden Brill |isbn= |pages= ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treaties and political and commercial agreements; arbitration, etc.====
In addition to inscriptions which are concerned with the internal affairs of various cities, there are many others recording treaties or other agreements of an international character between various cities and states. These were incised on bronze or stone, and set up in places of public resort in the cities concerned, or in common religious centres such as Olympia and Delphi. The simplest form of treaty is merely an alliance for a certain term of years, usually with some penalty for any breach of the conditions. Often an oath was prescribed, to be taken by representatives on each side; it was also not unusual to appeal to the god in whose temple the treaty was exhibited. In other cases a list of gods by whom the two parties must swear is prescribed. Commercial clauses were sometimes added to treaties of alliance, and commercial treaties are also found, agreeing as to the export and import of merchandise and other things. In later days, especially in the time of the Hellenistic kings, treaties tend to become more complicated and detailed in their provisions.&lt;ref name="GEpi"/&gt;

Another series of records of great historical interest is concerned with arbitration between various states on various questions, mainly concerned with frontiers. In cases of dispute it was not uncommon for the two disputants to appoint a third party as arbitrator. Sometimes this third party was another State, sometimes a specified number of individuals. Thus, in a frontier dispute between Corinth and [[Epidaurus]], 151 citizens of [[Megara]] were appointed by name to arbitrate, and when the decision was disputed, 31 from among them revised and confirmed it. In all such cases it was the custom for a full record to be preserved on stone and set up in the places concerned. In this case the initiative in referring the matter to arbitration came from the [[Achaean League]].&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Proxenia decrees====
A very large class of inscriptions deals with the institution of ''[[proxenia]]''. According to this a citizen of any State might be appointed ''proxenos'' of another State; his duties would then be to offer help and hospitality to any citizen of that other State who might be visiting his city, and to assist him in any dispute or in securing his legal rights. The office has been compared to the modern appointment of [[consul (representative)|consul]]s, with the essential difference that the ''proxenos'' is always a citizen of the state in which he resides, not of that whose citizens and interests he assists. The decrees upon this matter frequently record the appointment of a ''proxenos'', and the conferring on him of certain benefits and privileges in return for his services; they also contain resolutions of thanks from the city served by the ''proxenos'', and record honours consequently conferred upon him.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=Enrica Culasso Gastaldi   |title=Le prossenie ateniesi del IV secolo a.C.: gli onorati asiatici (Fonti e studi di storia antica, 10) |url= |accessdate= |year=2004 |location=Alessandria |publisher=Edizioni dell'Orso |isbn= |pages= ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Honours and privileges given to individuals====
This class of inscription is in form not unlike the last, except that honours recorded are given for all sorts of services, private and public, to the State and to individuals. A frequent addition is an invitation to dine in the [[Prytaneum]] at Athens. Some are inscribed on the bases of statues set up to the recipient. In early times these inscriptions are usually brief and simple. The bust of [[Pericles]] on the Acropolis held nothing but the names of Pericles himself and of the sculptor [[Kresilas]]. Later it became usual to give, in some detail, the reasons for the honours awarded; and in Hellenistic and Roman times, these became more and more detailed and fulsome in laudatory detail.

====Signatures of artists====
[[File:Sophilos me grafsen inscription Lebes BM 1971.11-1.1.jpg|thumb|Black-figure [[dinos]] with stand, Attic, c. 570 BC. Signed by [[Sophilos]]: ΣΟΦΙΛΟΣ [...] ΜΕΓΡΑΦΣΕΝ, "Sophilos drew me"]]

These inscriptions are of special interest as throwing much light upon the history of art. The artist's name was usually, especially in earlier times, carved upon the base of the pedestal of a statue, and consequently was easily separated from it if the statue was carried off or destroyed. A case where both statue and pedestal are preserved is offered by the ''[[Victory]]'', signed on its pedestal by [[Paeonius]] at Olympia. Occasionally, and more frequently in later times, the artist's signature was carved upon some portion of the statue itself. But in later copies of well-known works, it has to be considered whether the name is that of the original artist or of the copyist who reproduced his work. (see for example, [[#FN1|the statue of Hercules/Heracles]] below)

A special class of artists' signatures is offered by the names signed by [[Attic vase|Attic]] and other vase painters upon their vases. These have been made the basis of a minute [[Pottery of ancient Greece|historical and stylistic study]] of the work of these painters, and unsigned vases also have been grouped with the signed ones, so as to make an exact and detailed record of this branch of Greek artistic production.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'', {{cite book|author=Joseph Veach Noble   |title=The Techniques of Painted Attic Pottery |url= |accessdate= |year=1988 |location=New York |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0500050477 |pages=}}; {{cite book|author=Martin Robinson   |title=The Art of Vase-Painting in Classical Athens |url= |accessdate= |year=1992 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521338813 |pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical records====
The great majority of these fall into one of the classes already referred to. But there are some instances in which an inscription is set up merely as a record. For instance, a victor in athletic or other contests may set up a list of his victories. The most famous historical record is the [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|autobiographical account of the deeds and administration]] of [[Augustus]], which was reproduced and set up in many places; it is generally known as the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]], because the most complete copy of it was found at [[Ancyra]]. The [[Marmor Parium]] at [[Oxford]], found in [[Paros]], is a chronological record of Greek history, probably made for educational purposes, and valuable as giving the traditional dates of events from the earliest time down.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author1=P. Botteri |author2=G. Fangi |title=The Ancyra Project: the Temple of Augustus and Rome |url= |accessdate= |year=2003 |location=Ankara |publisher=ISPRS Archives, volume XXXIV part 5/W12 Commission V |isbn= |pages=84–88}}; see also ''[https://archive.org/details/parianchronicle00robegoog The Parian chronicle, or The chronicle of the Arundelian marbles; with a dissertation concerning its authenticity]'' by [[Joseph Robertson (clergyman)|Joseph Robertson]] 1788, from the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tombs and epitaphs====
This is by far the most numerous class of inscriptions, both Greek and Latin. In early times there is often no record beyond the name of the deceased in Athens, often with the name of his father and his [[deme]]. Sometimes a word or two of conventional praise is added, such as "a good and wise man". Occasionally the circumstances of death are alluded to, especially if it took place in battle or at sea. Such [[epitaph]]s were frequently in [[metrical form]], usually either [[hexameter]] or [[elegiacs]]. Many of them have been collected, and they form an interesting addition to the Greek anthology. In later times it becomes usual to give more elaborate praise of the deceased; but this is hardly ever so detailed and fulsome as on more modern tombstones. The age and other facts about the deceased are occasionally given, but not nearly so often as on Latin tombstones, which offer valuable statistical information in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'' the interesting ''[[Epitaph of Seikilos]]'' by C. V. Palisca &amp; J. P. Burkholder, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin inscriptions==
{{See also|Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|List of classical abbreviations}}
[[File:Aquileia Basilica - Ausgrabungen Mosaik 5.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica of Aquileia]], 4th-century mosaic with Latin inscription: ''IANUARI DEDEI DONO P * DCCCLXX'' (Januarius paid for 870 square feet of mosaic)]]

[[Latin language|Latin]] inscriptions may be classified on much the same lines as Greek; but certain broad distinctions may be drawn at the outset. They are generally more standardised as to form and as to content, not only in Rome and Italy, but also throughout the [[provinces of the Roman Empire]]. One of the chief difficulties in deciphering [[Latin Inscriptions]] lies in the very extensive use of [[List of classical abbreviations|initials and abbreviations]]. These are of great number and variety, and while some of them can be easily interpreted as belonging to well-known formulae, others offer considerable difficulty, especially to the inexperienced student.&lt;ref&gt;A mere list of such initials and abbreviations occupies 68 pages in [[René Cagnat]]'s ''Cours d'épigraphie Latine'' (repr. 1923). A selection is included in [[Wikipedia]]'s "[[List of classical abbreviations]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Often the same initial may have many different meanings according to the context. Some common formulae such as '''V.S.L.M.''' (''votum solvit libens merito''), or '''H.M.H.N.S.''' (''hoc monumentum heredem non sequetur'') offer little difficulty, but there are many which are not so obvious and leave room for conjecture. Often the only way to determine the meaning is to search through a list of initials, such as those given by modern Latin epigraphists, until a formula is found which fits the context.

Most of what has been said about Greek inscriptions applies to Roman also. The commonest materials in this case also are stone, marble and bronze; but a more extensive use is made of stamped bricks and tiles, which are often of historical value as identifying and dating a building or other construction. The same applies to leaden water pipes which frequently bear dates and names of officials. Terracotta lamps also frequently have their makers' names and other information stamped upon them. Arms, and especially shields, sometimes bear the name and corps of their owners. Leaden discs were also used to serve the same purpose as modern identification discs. Inscriptions are also found on sling bullets — Roman as well as Greek; there are also numerous classes of ''[[tesserae]]'' or tickets of admission to theatres or other shows.

As regards the contents of inscriptions, there must evidently be a considerable difference between records of a number of independent city states and an empire including almost all the civilised world; but municipalities maintained much of their independent traditions in Roman times, and consequently their inscriptions often follow the old formulas.

The classification of Roman inscriptions may, therefore, follow the same lines as the Greek, except that certain categories are absent, and that some others, not found in Greek, are of considerable importance.

===Religious===

====Dedications and foundations of temples, etc.====
[[File:RMW - Weiheplakette Victoria.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Votive plaque for ''Victoria'', set by Flavius Primus, curator of the [[Turma]] [[Maximinus Thrax|Maximini]]&lt;ref&gt;It reads: ''Victo(riae) Fl(avius) P/rimus cur(ator) / tur(mae) Maxi/mini''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

These are very numerous; and the custom of placing the name of the dedicator in a conspicuous place on the building was prevalent, especially in the case of dedications by emperors or officials, or by public bodies. Restoration or repair was often recorded in the same manner. In the case of small objects the dedication is usually simple in form; it usually contains the name of the god or other recipient and of the donor, and a common formula is '''D.D.''' (''dedit, donavit'') often with additions such as '''L.M.''' (''libens merito''). Such dedications are often the result of a vow, and '''V.S.''' (''votum solvit'') is therefore often added. Bequests made under the wills of rich citizens are frequently recorded by inscriptions; these might either be for religious or for social purposes.

====Priests and officials====
A priesthood was frequently a political office and consequently is mentioned along with political honours in the list of a man's distinctions. The priesthoods that a man had held are usually mentioned first in inscriptions before his civil offices and distinctions. Religious offices, as well as civil, were restricted to certain classes, the highest to those of senatorial rank, the next to those of [[Equestrian order|equestrian status]]; many minor offices, both in Rome and in the provinces, are enumerated in their due order.

====Regulations as to religion and cult====
Among the most interesting of these is the ancient song and accompanying dance performed by the priests known as the [[Arval Brothers]]. This is, however, not in the form of a ritual prescription, but a detailed record of the due performance of the rite. An important class of documents is the series of calendars that have been found in Rome and in the various Italian towns. These give notice of religious festivals and anniversaries, and also of the days available for various purposes.

====Colleges====
The various collegese for religious purposes were very numerous. Many of them, both in Rome and Italy, and in provincial municipalities, were of the nature of priesthoods. Some were regarded as offices of high distinction and were open only to men of senatorial rank; among these were the [[Augurs]], the [[Fetiales]], the [[Salii]]; also the [[Sodales Augustales|Sodales Divorum Augustorum]] in imperial times. The records of these colleges sometimes give no information beyond the names of members, but these are often of considerable interest. [[Haruspices]] and [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#Luperci|Luperci]] were of equestrian rank.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Political and social===

====Codes of law and regulations====
Our information as to these is not mainly drawn from inscriptions and, therefore, they need not here be considered. On the other hand, the word ''lex'' (law) is usually applied to all decrees of the senate or other bodies, whether of legislative or of administrative character. It is therefore, best to consider all together under the heading of public decrees.

====Laws and plebiscites, senatus consulta, decrees of magistrates or later of emperors====
A certain number of these dating from republican times are of considerable interest. One of the earliest relates to the prohibition of [[Bacchanalia|bacchanalian orgies]] in Italy; it takes the form of a message from the magistrates, stating the authority on which they acted. Laws all follow a fixed formula, according to the body which has passed them. First there is a statement that the legislative body was consulted by the appropriate magistrate in due form; then follows the text of the law; and finally the sanction, the statement that the law was passed. In decrees of the senate the formula differs somewhat. They begin with a preamble giving the names of the consulting magistrates, the place and conditions of the meeting; then comes the subject submitted for decision, ending with the formula '''QDERFP''' (''quid de ea re fieri placeret''); then comes the decision of the senate, opening with '''DERIC''' (''de ea re ita censuerunt''). '''C.''' is added at the end, to indicate that the decree was passed. In imperial times, the emperor sometimes addressed a speech to the senate, advising them to pass certain resolutions, or else, especially in later times, gave orders or instructions directly, either on his own initiative or in response to questions or references. The number and variety of such orders is such that no classification of them can be given here. One of the most famous is the edict of [[Diocletian]], [[Edict on Maximum Prices|fixing the prices of all commodities]]. Copies of this in Greek as well as in Latin have been found in various parts of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=E.R. Graser   |title=An Economic Survey of Ancient Rome Volume V: Rome and Italy of the Empire |editor=T. Frank |url= |accessdate= |year=1940 |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press — esp. "A text and translation of the Edict of Diocletian" |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Records of buildings, etc.====
[[File:Hans lutz Pfk bozen.jpg|thumb|German inscription recording the building of [[Bozen]]-Bolzano's Parish Church ([[South Tyrol]]) by Hans Lutz of Schussenried, from the early 16th century (1501–1519)]]
A very large number of inscriptions record the construction or repair of public buildings by private individuals, by magistrates, Roman or provincial, and by emperors. In addition to the dedication of temples, we find inscriptions recording the construction of [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]]s, roads, especially on [[milestone]]s, baths, [[basilica]]s, [[portico]]s and many other works of public utility. In inscriptions of early period often nothing is given but the name of the person who built or restored the edifice and a statement that he had done so. But later it was usual to give more detail as to the motive of the building, the name of the emperor or a magistrate giving the date, the authority for the building and the names and distinctions of the builders; then follows a description of the building, the source of the expenditure (e.g., '''S.P.''', ''sua pecunia'') and finally the appropriate verb for the work done, whether building, restoring, enlarging or otherwise improving. Other details are sometimes added, such as the name of the man under whose direction the work was done.

====Military documents====
[[File:AMG - Ziegel Cohors III.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Brick stamp with military record: "C(ohors) III BR(acaraugustanorum)", from [[Bavaria]].]]

These vary greatly in content, and are among the most important documents concerning the administration of the Roman Empire. "They are numerous and of all sorts — tombstones of every degree, lists of soldiers' burial clubs, certificates of discharge from service, schedules of time-expired men, dedications of altars, records of building or of engineering works accomplished. The facts directly commemorated are rarely important."&lt;ref name="Haverf"&gt;{{aut|Francis Haverfield}}, "Roman Authority" in {{aut|S. R. Driver, D. G. Hogarth, F. L. Griffith}}, ''et al.'' ''Authority and Archaeology, Sacred and Profane: Essays On the Relation of Monuments to Biblical and Classical Literature'', Ulan Press (repr. 2012), p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; But when the information from hundreds of such inscriptions is collected together, "you can trace the whole policy of the Imperial Government in the matter of recruiting, to what extent and till what date legionaries were raised in Italy; what contingents for various branches of the service were drawn from the provinces, and which provinces provided most; how far provincials garrisoned their own countries, and which of them, like the British recruits, were sent as a measure of precaution to serve elsewhere; or, finally, at what epoch the empire grew weak enough to require the enlistment of barbarians from beyond its frontiers."&lt;ref name="Haverf"/&gt;

====Treaties and agreements====
There were many treaties between Rome and other states in [[Roman Republic|republican times]]; but we do not, as a rule, owe our knowledge of these to inscriptions, which are very rare in this earlier period. In imperial times, to which most Latin inscriptions belong, international relations were subject to the universal domination of Rome, and consequently the documents relating to them are concerned with reference to the central authority, and often take the form of orders from the emperor.
&lt;span id="FN1"&gt;

====Proxeny====
{{See also|Patronage in ancient Rome}}
This custom belonged to Greece. What most nearly corresponded to it in Roman times was the adoption of some distinguished Roman as its ''[[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]]'', by a city or state. The relation was then recorded, usually on a bronze tablet placed in some conspicuous position in the town concerned. The patron probably also kept a copy in his house, or had a portable tablet which would ensure his recognition and reception.

====Honorary====
Honorary inscriptions are extremely common in all parts of the Roman world. Sometimes they are placed on the bases of statues, sometimes in documents set up to record some particular benefaction or the construction of some public work. The offices held by the person commemorated, and the distinctions conferred upon him are enumerated in a regularly established order (''[[cursus honorum]]''), either beginning with the lower and proceeding step by step to the higher, or in reverse order with the highest first. Religious and priestly offices are usually mentioned before civil and political ones. These might be exercised either in Rome itself, or in the various municipalities of the empire. There was also a distinction drawn between offices that might be held only by persons of senatorial rank, those that were assigned to persons of equestrian rank, and those of a less distinguished kind. It follows that when only a portion of an inscription has been found, it is often possible to restore the whole in accordance with the accepted order.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Signatures of artists====
When these are attached to statues, it is sometimes doubtful whether the name is that of the man who actually made the statue, or of the master whose work it reproduces. Thus there are two well-known copies of a statue of [[Hercules]] by [[Lysippus]], of which one is said to be the work of Lysippus, and the other states that it was [[#FN1|made by Glycon (see images)]]. Another kind of artist's or artificer's signature that is commoner in Roman times is to be found in the signatures of potters upon lamps and various kinds of vessels; they are usually impressed on the mould and stand out in relief on the terracotta or other material. These are of interest as giving much information as to the commercial spread of various kinds of handicrafts, and also as to the conditions under which they were manufactured.

====Historical records====
Many of these inscriptions might well be assigned to one of the categories already considered. But there are some which were expressly made to commemorate an important event, or to preserve a record. Among the most interesting is the inscription of the ''[[Rostral column|Columna Rostrata]]'' in Rome, which records the great naval victory of [[Gaius Duilius]] over the [[Carthaginians]]; this, however, is not the original, but a later and somewhat modified version. A document of high importance is a summary of the life and achievements of Augustus, already mentioned, and known as the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]]. The various sets of [[Fasti]] constituted a record of the names of consuls, and other magistrates or high officials, and also of the triumphs accorded to conquering generals.

====Inscriptions on tombs====
[[Image:Scipio-tomb.jpg|thumb|left|The [[tomb]] of [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus]], erected around 150 BC, contains an [[Old Latin]] inscription in [[Saturnian Metre]].]]
These are probably the most numerous of all classes of inscriptions; and though many of them are of no great individual interest, they convey, when taken collectively, much valuable information as to the distribution and transference of population, as to trades and professions, as to health and longevity, and as to many other conditions of ancient life. The most interesting early series is that on the tombs of the [[Scipio (cognomen)|Scipios]] at Rome, recording, mostly in [[Saturnian Metre]], the exploits and distinctions of the various members of that family.&lt;ref name="Cour"&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=Edward Courtney   |title=MUSA LAPIDARIA: A Selection of Latin Verse Inscriptions |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |location=Atlanta |publisher=Scholars Press |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the end of the republic and the beginning of the empire, it became customary to head a tombstone with the letters '''D.M.''' or '''D.M.S.''' (''Dis Manibus sacrum''), thus consecrating the tomb to the deceased as having become members of the [[Manes|body of ghosts or spirits of the dead]]. These are followed by the name of the deceased, usually with his father's name and his tribe, by his honours and distinctions, sometimes by a record of his age. The inscription often concludes with '''H.I.''' (''Hic iacet''), or some similar formula, and also, frequently, with a statement of boundaries and a prohibition of violation or further use — for instance, '''H.M.H.N.S.''' (''hoc monumentum heredem non sequetur'', this monument is not to pass to the heir). The person who has erected the monument and his relation to the deceased are often stated; or if a man has prepared the tomb in his lifetime, this also may be stated, '''V.S.F.''' (''vivus sibi fecit''). But there is an immense variety in the information that either a man himself or his friend may wish to record.&lt;ref name="Cour"/&gt;

====Milestones and boundaries====
Milestones (''[[Miliarium#Milestones and markers|miliaria]]'') have already been referred to, and may be regarded as records of the building of roads. Boundary stones (''[[Boundary marker|termini]]'') are frequently found, both of public and private property. A well-known instance is offered by those set up by the commissioners called '''III. viri A.I.A.''' (''agris iudicandis adsignandis'') in the time of the [[Gracchi]].&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

Latin inscriptions are the meeting point of [[Roman history]] and several arts. These are arts of expression or composition, writing in the strictly physical sense, and design or arrangement. The history is [[Roman history]] in its largest sense, involving men and women in many of their affairs, such as life and death, government, law, religious worship — all as illustrated above. The related fields one has to enter in order to fully appreciate the epigraphical study, are many: beside all aspects of Roman history, such more restricted but still large fields as ancient jewelry, [[Etruscology]], Italic and Latin [[philology]], ancient pottery, comparative [[palaeography]], Roman nomenclature, [[Latin verse]], [[lexicography]] (including inconsistencies of spelling, the early lack of a standard orthography0, Roman architecture and [[prosopography]], and the pronunciation of Greek as revealed by the rendering of Greek words in Latin inscriptions and of Latin words in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Arthur E. Gordon, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ywI6SDUggk4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true ''Latin Epigraphy''], [[University of California Press]], 1983, Introd., pp.3-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Selfish gene theory||Selfish gene (disambiguation)}}
{{evolutionary biology}}

The '''gene-centered view of evolution''', '''gene's eye view''', '''gene selection theory''', or '''selfish gene theory''' holds that adaptive [[evolution]] occurs through the differential survival of competing [[gene]]s, increasing the [[allele frequency]] of those [[allele]]s whose [[phenotypic trait]] effects successfully promote their own propagation, with gene defined as "not just one single physical bit of DNA [but] all replicas of a particular bit of DNA distributed throughout the world".&lt;ref name="selfishgene" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Haig |first=David |authorlink=David Haig (biologist) |date=2012-07-01 |title=The strategic gene |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-012-9315-5 |journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=461–479 |doi=10.1007/s10539-012-9315-5 |issn=0169-3867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gardner |first=Andy |title=The Strategic Revolution |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867416311308 |journal=Cell |volume=166 |issue=6 |pages=1345–1348 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proponents of this viewpoint argue that, since [[heritability|heritable]] information is passed from generation to generation almost exclusively by [[DNA]], [[natural selection]] and evolution are best considered from the perspective of genes.

Proponents of the gene-centered viewpoint argue that it permits understanding of diverse phenomena such as [[altruism in animals|altruism]] and [[intragenomic conflict]] that are otherwise difficult to explain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins| date=January 1979 |title=Twelve Misunderstandings of Kin Selection |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1979.tb00682.x/full |journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie |volume=51 |pages=184–200 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1979.tb00682.x |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ågren |first=J.

The gene-centered view of evolution is a synthesis of the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]], the [[particulate inheritance theory]], and the [[Lamarckism|non-transmission of acquired characters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-19932-0_3 |title=Life’s dual nature: a way out of the impasse of the gene-centred 'versus' complex systems controversy on life |last=Tiège |first=Alexis De |last2=Tanghe |first2=Koen B. |last3=Braeckman |first3=Johan |authorlink3=Johan Braeckman |last4=Peer |first4=Yves Van de |date=2015 |work=Evolutionary Biology: Biodiversification from Genotype to Phenotype |publisher=Springer, Cham |isbn=9783319199313 |location= |pages=35–52  |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-19932-0_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Crow |first=James F. |date=2001-02-15 |title=The beanbag lives on |url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/35057409 |journal=Nature |volume=409 |issue=6822 |pages=771–771 |doi=10.1038/35057409}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that those [[allele]]s whose phenotypic effects successfully promote their own propagation will be favorably selected relative to their competitor alleles within the population. This process produces adaptations for the benefit of alleles that promote the reproductive success of the [[organism]], or of other organisms containing the same allele ([[kin altruism]] and [[green-beard effect]]s), or even its own propagation relative to the other [[gene]]s within the same organism ([[Selfish genetic element|selfish genes]] and [[intragenomic conflict]]).

The gene-centered perspective can be traced to the philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] who wrote, in his book, ‘Creative Evolution’ (1907)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'Évolution créatrice (Creative Evolution)|last=Bergson|first=Henri|authorlink=Henri Bergson |publisher=|year=1907|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

‘Life is like a current passing from germ to germ through the medium of a developed organism. It is as if the organism itself were only an excrescence, a bud caused to sprout by the former endeavouring to continue itself in a new germ’.

The gene-centered view of [[evolution]] is a model for the evolution of social characteristics such as selfishness and altruism.

===Acquired characteristics===
The formulation of the [[central dogma of molecular biology]] was summarized by [[Maynard Smith]]:

{{quote|If the central dogma is true, and if it is also true that nucleic acids are the only means whereby information is transmitted between generations, this has crucial implications for evolution. It would imply that all evolutionary novelty requires changes in nucleic acids, and that these changes &amp;ndash; mutations &amp;ndash; are essentially accidental and non-adaptive in nature. Changes elsewhere &amp;ndash; in the egg cytoplasm, in materials transmitted through the placenta, in the mother's milk &amp;ndash; might alter the development of the child, but, unless the changes were in nucleic acids, they would have no long-term evolutionary effects.|Maynard Smith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=John Maynard Smith | last=Maynard Smith | first=J. | year=1998 | title=Evolutionary Genetics | edition=2nd | publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK | pages=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Williams' 1966 book ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'',

{{quote|[t]he essence of the genetical theory of natural selection is a statistical bias in the relative rates of survival of alternatives (genes, individuals, etc.). The effectiveness of such bias in producing adaptation is contingent on the maintenance of certain quantitative relationships among the operative factors. One necessary condition is that the selected entity must have a high degree of permanence and a low rate of endogenous change, relative to the degree of bias (differences in selection coefficients).|Williams,&lt;ref name="williams66"/&gt; 1966, pp. 22&amp;ndash;23}}

Williams argued that "[t]he natural selection of [[phenotype]]s cannot in itself produce cumulative change, because phenotypes are extremely temporary manifestations." Each phenotype is the unique product of the interaction between genome and environment. It does not matter how fit and fertile a phenotype is, it will eventually be destroyed and will never be duplicated.

Since 1954, it has been known that [[DNA]] is the main physical substrate to genetic information, and it is capable of high-fidelity [[DNA replication|replication]] through many generations. So, a particular gene coded in a [[nucleobase]] sequence of a lineage of replicated DNA molecules can have a high permanence and a low rate of endogenous change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/documents/ThirdCulture/h-Ch.1.html|title=A package of information|last=Williams|first=George C.| authorlink=George C. Williams (biologist) |date=1995|website=Edge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In normal sexual reproduction, an entire [[genome]] is the unique combination of father's and mother's chromosomes produced at the moment of fertilization. It is generally destroyed with its organism, because "[[meiosis]] and [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] destroy genotypes as surely as death."&lt;ref name="williams66"/&gt; Only half of it is transmitted to each descendant due to [[Mendelian inheritance#Mendel.27s law of segregation|independent segregation]].

And the high prevalence of horizontal gene transfer in [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] means that genomic combinations of these asexually reproducing groups are also transient in evolutionary time: "The traditional view, that prokaryotic evolution can be understood primarily in terms of clonal divergence and periodic selection, must be augmented to embrace gene exchange as a creative force."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gogarten|first=J.

The gene as an informational entity persists for an evolutionarily significant span of time through a lineage of many physical copies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In his book ''[[River out of Eden]]'', Dawkins coins the phrase ''[[God's utility function]]'' to explain his view on genes as units of selection. He uses this phrase as a synonym of the "[[meaning of life]]" or the "purpose of life". By rephrasing the word ''purpose'' in terms of what [[economists]] call a [[utility function]], meaning "that which is maximized", Dawkins attempts to [[reverse engineering|reverse-engineer]] the purpose in the mind of the Divine Engineer of Nature, or the ''utility function of god''. Finally, Dawkins argues that it is a mistake to assume that an [[ecosystem]] or a [[species]] as a whole exists for a purpose. He writes that it is incorrect to suppose that individual organisms lead a meaningful life either; in nature, only genes have a utility function – to perpetuate their own existence with indifference to great sufferings inflicted upon the organisms they build, exploit and discard.

===Organisms as vehicles===

Genes are usually packed together inside a genome, which is itself contained inside an organism. Genes group together into genomes because "genetic replication makes use of energy and substrates that are supplied by the metabolic economy in much greater quantities than would be possible without a genetic division of labour."&lt;ref name="haig97"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=David Haig (biologist) | last=Haig | first=D. | year=1997 | chapter=The Social Gene | editor1-first=J. R. | editor1-last=Krebs | editor1-link=John Krebs, Baron Krebs | editor2-first=N. B. | editor2-last=Davies | editor2-link=Nicholas Barry Davies |title=Behavioural Ecology | publisher=Blackwell Scientific, UK | pages=284–304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They build vehicles to promote their mutual interests of jumping into the next generation of vehicles. As Dawkins puts it, organisms are the "[[The Selfish Gene#Crude analogy|survival machine]]s" of genes.&lt;ref name="selfishgene"/&gt;

The phenotypic effect of a particular gene is contingent on its environment, including the fellow genes constituting with it the total genome. A gene never has a fixed effect, so how is it possible to speak of a gene for long legs? It is because of the phenotypic ''differences'' between alleles. One may say that one allele, all other things being equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.

"A gene can have multiple phenotypic effects, each of which may be of positive, negative or neutral value. It is the net selective value of a gene's phenotypic effect that determines the fate of the gene."&lt;ref name="cronin91"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Helena Cronin | last=Cronin | first=H. | year=1991 | title=The Ant and the Peacock | publisher=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK | isbn=0-521-32937-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a gene can cause its bearer to have greater reproductive success at a young age, but also cause a greater likelihood of death at a later age. If the benefit outweighs the harm, averaged out over the individuals and environments in which the gene happens to occur, then phenotypes containing the gene will generally be positively selected and thus the abundance of that gene in the population will increase.

Even so, it becomes necessary to model the genes in combination with their vehicle as well as in combination with the vehicle's environment.

==Selfish-gene theory==
The selfish-gene theory of natural selection can be restated as follows:&lt;ref name="cronin91"/&gt;

{{quote|Genes do not present themselves naked to the scrutiny of natural selection, instead they present their phenotypic effects. [...] Differences in genes give rise to differences in these phenotypic effects. Natural selection acts on the phenotypic differences and thereby on genes. Thus genes come to be represented in successive generations in proportion to the selective value of their phenotypic effects.|Cronin, 1991, p. 60}}

The result is that "the prevalent genes in a sexual population must be those that, as a mean condition, through a large number of genotypes in a large number of situations, have had the most favourable phenotypic effects for their own replication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink=George C. Williams (biologist) | last=Williams | first=G. C. | year=1985 | title=A defense of reductionism in evolutionary biology | journal=Oxford Surveys in Evolutionary Biology | volume=2 | pages=1–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, we expect [[Selfish genetic element|selfish genes]] ("selfish" meaning that it promotes its own survival without necessarily promoting the survival of the organism, group or even species). This theory implies that [[adaptation]]s are the phenotypic effects of genes to maximize their representation in future generations. An adaptation is maintained by selection if it promotes genetic survival directly, or else some subordinate goal that ultimately contributes to successful reproduction.

===Individual altruism and genetic egoism===

The gene is a unit of hereditary information that exists in many physical copies in the world, and which particular physical copy will be replicated and originate new copies does not matter from the gene's point of view.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=George C. Williams (biologist) | last=Williams | first=G. C. | year=1992 | title=Natural Selection: Domains, Levels and Challenges | publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK | isbn=0-19-506932-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A selfish gene could be favored by selection by producing altruism among organisms containing it. The idea is summarized as follows:

{{quote|If a gene copy confers a benefit ''B'' on another vehicle at cost ''C'' to its own vehicle, its costly action is strategically beneficial if ''pB &gt; C'', where ''p'' is the probability that a copy of the gene is present in the vehicle that benefits. Actions with substantial costs therefore require significant values of ''p''. Two kinds of factors ensure high values of ''p'': relatedness (kinship) and recognition (green beards).|Haig,&lt;ref name="haig97"/&gt; 1997, p. 288}}

A gene in a [[somatic (biology)|somatic]] cell of an individual may forego replication to promote the transmission of its copies in the germ line cells. It ensures the high value of ''p = 1'' due to their constant contact and their common origin from the [[zygote]].

The [[kin selection]] theory predicts that a gene may promote the recognition of kinship by historical continuity: a mammalian mother learns to identify her own offspring in the act of giving birth; a male preferentially directs resources to the offspring of mothers with whom he has copulated; the other chicks in a nest are siblings; and so on. The expected altruism between kin is calibrated by the value of ''p'', also known as the [[coefficient of relationship|coefficient of relatedness]]. For instance, an individual has a ''p = 1/2'' in relation to his brother, and ''p = 1/8'' to his cousin, so we would expect, ''[[ceteris paribus]]'', greater altruism among brothers than among cousins. In this vein, geneticist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] famously joked, "Would I lay down my life to save my brother? No, but I would to save two brothers or eight cousins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Clark | first=Ronald W. |authorlink=Ronald W. Clark |year=1968 | title=JBS: The Life and Work of J. B. S. Haldane | isbn=0-340-04444-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, examining the human propensity for altruism, kin selection theory seems incapable of explaining cross-familiar, cross-racial and even cross-species acts of kindness. &lt;!-- A far more expansive explanation for altruism is rooted in the [[green-beard effect]].--&gt;

===Green-beard effect===

[[Green-beard effect]]s gained their name from a thought-experiment of Richard Dawkins,&lt;ref name="selfishgene"/&gt; who considered the possibility of a gene that caused its possessors to develop a green beard and to be nice to other green-bearded individuals. Since then, "green-beard effect" has come to refer to forms of genetic self-recognition in which a gene in one individual might direct benefits to other individuals that possess the gene. Such genes would be ''especially selfish'', benefiting themselves regardless of the fates of their vehicles. After Dawkins predicted them, green-beard genes have been discovered in nature, such as ''Gp-9'' in fire ants (''Solenopsis invicta''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krieger|first=Michael J.

===All kinds of altruism===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}

====Kindness====

On the other hand, a single trait, group reciprocal kindness, is capable of explaining the vast majority of altruism that is generally accepted as "good" by modern societies. Imagine a green-bearding behavioral trait whose recognition does not depend on the recognition of some external feature such as beard color, but relies on recognition of the behavior itself. Imagine now that the behavior is altruistic. The success of such a trait in sufficiently intelligent and undeceived organisms is implicit. Moreover, the existence of such a trait predicts a tendency for kindness to unrelated organisms that are apparently kind, even if the organisms are of a completely different species. Moreover, the gene need not be exactly the same, so long as the effect is similar. Multiple versions of the gene—or even [[meme]]—would have virtually the same effect in a sort of [[symbiotic]] green-bearding cycle of altruism.

====Deceit====

Whenever recognition plays a role in evolution, so does deception. Just like the harmless lizard that has evolved a pattern that mimics its poisonous cousin and therefore tricks predators, the selfish creature may pretend to be kind by "growing a green beard" (whatever that green beard may be). Thus green-bearding and the selfish-gene theory also give rise to an explanation for the evolution of lies and deceit, characteristics that do not benefit the population as a whole.

==Intragenomic conflict==
{{Main|Intragenomic conflict}}

As genes are capable of producing individual altruism, they are capable of producing conflict among genes inside the genome of one individual. This phenomenon is called [[intragenomic conflict]] and arises when one gene promotes its own replication in detriment to other genes in the genome. The classic example is segregation distorter genes that cheat during [[meiosis]] or [[gametogenesis]] and end up in more than half of the functional [[gamete]]s. These genes can persist in a population even when their transmission results in reduced [[fertility]]. Egbert Leigh compared the genome to "a parliament of genes: each acts in its own self-interest, but if its acts hurt the others, they will combine together to suppress it" to explain the relative low occurrence of intragenomic conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Leigh | first=Egbert Giles | year=1971 | title=Adaptation and Diversity | publisher=Cooper, San Francisco, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Price equation==
{{main|Price equation}}

The [[Price equation]] is a [[covariance]] equation that is a mathematical description of [[evolution]] and [[natural selection]]. The Price equation was derived by [[George R. Price]], working in [[London]] to rederive [[W. D. Hamilton]]'s work on [[kin selection]].

==Advocates==
Besides [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], other [[biologist]]s and [[philosopher]]s have expanded and refined the selfish-gene theory, such as [[John Maynard Smith]], [[George R. Price]], [[Robert Trivers]], [[David Haig (biologist)|David Haig]], [[Helena Cronin]], [[David Hull]], [[Philip Kitcher]], and [[Daniel C. Dennett]].

==Criticisms==
The gene-centric view has been opposed by [[Ernst Mayr]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]], [[David Sloan Wilson]], and philosopher [[Elliott Sober]]. An alternative, [[multilevel selection]] (MLS), has been advocated by [[E. O. Wilson]], David Sloan Wilson, Sober, Richard E. Michod,&lt;ref name="Philosophy 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shelton |first1=Deborah E. |last2=Michod |first2=Richard E. |title=Philosophical foundations for the hierarchy of life |journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy |date=3 April 2009 |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=391–403 |doi=10.1007/s10539-009-9160-3 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-009-9160-3 |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Samir Okasha]].&lt;ref name="Philosophy 2010"/&gt;

Writing in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', Gould has characterized the gene-centered perspective as confusing book-keeping with [[causality]]. Gould views selection as working on many levels, and has called attention to a hierarchical perspective of selection. Gould also called the claims of ''Selfish Gene'' "strict [[adaptationism]]", "ultra-Darwinism", and "Darwinian [[fundamentalism]]", describing them as excessively "[[reductionist]]". He saw the theory as leading to a simplistic "algorithmic" theory of evolution, or even to the re-introduction of a [[teleology|teleological principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=June 12, 1997 |title=Darwinian Fundamentalism |first=Stephen Jay |last=Gould |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/jun/12/darwinian-fundamentalism/ |work=The New York Review of Books |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayr went so far as to say "Dawkins' basic theory of the gene being the object of evolution is totally non-Darwinian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/mayr/mayr_print.html | title=Ernst Mayr: What evolution is | date=31 October 2001 | accessdate=21 July 2010 | publisher=Edge Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gould also addressed the issue of selfish genes in his essay "Caring groups and selfish genes".&lt;ref name="onselfishgenesinpandasthumb"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould | last=Gould | first=S. J. | year=1990 | chapter=Caring Groups and Selfish Genes | title=[[The Panda's Thumb (book)|The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History]] | publisher=Penguin Books, London, UK | pages=72–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould acknowledged that Dawkins was not imputing conscious action to genes, but simply using a shorthand metaphor commonly found in evolutionary writings. To Gould, the fatal flaw was that "no matter how much power Dawkins wishes to assign to genes, there is one thing that he cannot give them – direct visibility to natural selection."&lt;ref name="onselfishgenesinpandasthumb"/&gt; Rather, the unit of selection is the phenotype, not the genotype, because it is phenotypes that interact with the environment at the natural-selection interface. So, in [[Kim Sterelny]]'s summation of Gould's view, "gene differences do not cause evolutionary changes in populations, they register those changes."&lt;ref name="DawkinsvsGould"&gt;{{cite book | last=Sterelny | first=K. | authorlink=Kim Sterelny | year=2007 | title=[[Dawkins vs. Gould]]: Survival of the Fittest | publisher=Icon Books, Cambridge, UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Dawkins replied to this criticism in a later book, ''The Extended Phenotype'', that Gould confused particulate genetics with particulate embryology, stating that genes do "blend", as far as their effects on developing phenotypes are concerned, but that they do not blend as they replicate and recombine down the generations.&lt;ref name="extendedphenotype"/&gt;

Since Gould's death in 2002, [[Niles Eldredge]] has continued with counter-arguments to gene-centered natural selection.&lt;ref name="Eldredge2004"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Niles Eldredge | last=Eldredge | first=N. | year=2004 | title=Why We Do It: Rethinking Sex and The Selfish Gene | publisher=W. W. Norton, New York, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eldredge notes that in Dawkins' book ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'', which was published just before Eldredge's book, "Richard Dawkins comments on what he sees as the main difference between his position and that of the late Stephen Jay Gould. He concludes that it is his own vision that genes play a causal role in evolution," while Gould (and Eldredge) "sees genes as passive recorders of what worked better than what".&lt;ref name="Eldredge2004p233"&gt;Eldredge (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;233&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary}} 
'''Gracility''' is slenderness, the condition of being '''gracile''', which means slender.

It derives from the Latin adjective ''gracilis'' ([[Masculine (grammar)|masculine]] or [[Feminine (grammar)|feminine]]), or ''gracile'' ([[Grammatical gender|neuter]])&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Mason D., Jenkins, Thornton; “Latin for Today, Book 2”; Pub: Ginn and Co., Ltd. (1934) &lt;/ref&gt; which in either form means slender, and when transferred for example to discourse, takes the sense of "without ornament", "simple", or various similar [[connotation]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn0-02-522580-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Simpson, D. G. |title=Cassell's Latin dictionary: Latin-English, English-Latin |publisher=Cassell |location=London |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=0-02-522580-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his famous "Glossary of Botanic Terms", B. D. Jackson speaks dismissively&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Benjamin Daydon; "A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent" 4th Ed. 1928; Pub: Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, W.C.2&lt;/ref&gt; of an entry in earlier dictionary of A. A. Crozier&lt;ref&gt;Crozier, Arthur Alger; “A Dictionary of Botanical Terms”, Pub.: Henry Holt &amp; Co  1893. &lt;/ref&gt; as follows: ''Gracilis (Lat.), slender. Crozier has the needless word "gracile"''. However, his objection would be hard to sustain in current usage; apart from the fact that "gracile" is a natural and convenient term, it is hardly a [[neologism]]; the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&lt;ref name=OED&gt;Little, William; Fowler H.W.; Coulson J.; Onions, C.T. (Ed.):  "Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principals". Pub.: Oxford at the Clarendon Press (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; gives the source date for that usage as 1623. 

In the same entry for ''Gracile'', the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary remarks: ''Recently misused (through association with '''grace''') for Gracefully slender.'' This misuse is unfortunate at least, because the terms ''gracile'' and ''grace'' are completely unrelated: the etymological root of ''grace'' is the Latin word ''gratia'' from ''gratus'', meaning pleasing&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; and nothing to do with slenderness or thinness.    

== In biology ==
In biology, the term is in common use, whether as English or Latin:
* The term ''gracile''&amp;mdash;and its opposite, [[Robustness (morphology)|''robust'']]&amp;mdash;occur in discussion of the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of various [[hominids]] for example.
* The ''[[gracile fasciculus]]'' is a particular bundle of axon fibres in the spinal cord 
* The [[gracile nucleus]] is a particular structure of [[neuron]]s in the [[medulla oblongata]] 
* "[[GRACILE syndrome]]", is associated with a [[BCS1L]] [[mutation]] 

In [[Biological classification|biological taxonomy]], '''''gracile''''' is the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] or [[Specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] for various species. Where the gender is appropriate, the form is '''''gracilis'''''. Examples include:
* ''[[Campylobacter]] gracilis, a species of bacterium implicated in foodborne disease
* ''[[Ctenochasma]] gracile'', a late [[Jurassic]] [[pterosaur]]
* ''[[Eriophorum gracile]]'', a species of [[sedge]], [[Cyperaceae]]
* ''[[Euglena gracilis]]'', a unicellular flagellate protist
* ''[[Hydrophis]] gracilis'', a species of sea snakes
* ''[[Melampodium]] gracile'', a flowering plant species
* ''[[Moeritherium]] gracile'', an [[Eocene]] [[mammal]] species 

The same root appears in the names of some genera and higher [[Taxon|taxa]]:
* ''[[Gracilaria]]''  is a genus of red algae in the order ''Gracilariales''
* ''[[Gracillaria]]'' is a genus of [[leaf miner]] moths in the [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] ''[[Gracillarioidea]]''

==See also==
* [[Buckling]], for the slenderness ratio in engineering
* [[Grace (disambiguation)]]
* [[Gracilis (disambiguation)]], a Latin adjective in several species names{{spaced ndash}} as remarked above, the meanings are the same as for gracile, except for their grammatical gender
* [[Robustness (morphology)]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2046">'''The Harvard Five''' was a group of architects that settled in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]] in the 1940s: [[John M. Johansen]], [[Marcel Breuer]], [[Landis Gores]], [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Eliot Noyes]].  Marcel Breuer was an instructor at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], while Gores, Johansen, Johnson and Noyes were students there.&lt;ref&gt;"The Harvard Five in New Canaan", William D. Earls AIA, W. W Norton and Co., 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-393-73183-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were all influenced by [[Walter Gropius]], who founded the [[Bauhaus]] in 1919, and thereafter became head of the architecture program at [[Harvard]].

The small town of New Canaan is nationally recognized for its many examples of [[modern architecture]]. Approximately 100 modern homes were built in town, including Johnson's [[Glass House]] and the [[Landis Gores House]], and about 20 have been torn down.  Four are now listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]]: the [[Landis Gores House]], the [[Richard and Geraldine Hodgson House]], the [[Philip Johnson Glass House]], and the [[Noyes House (New Canaan, Connecticut)|Noyes House]].

Other notable architects lived in New Canaan and designed residences for themselves and clients there, including [[John Black Lee]], [[Hugh Smallen]], [[Victor Christ-Janer]], [[Alan Goldberg (architect)|Alan Goldberg]],&lt;ref name=gurliacci&gt;[http://www.fairfieldcountybusinessjournal.com/archive/010906/topstory1.html "Architect for All Seasons,"]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by David Gurliacci, Fairfield County Business Journal, January 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Carl Koch (architect)|Carl Koch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/northeast-region/new-canaan-ct/architects/carl-koch.html |title=Carl Koch |publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation |accessdate=15 November 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9035">'''Hypermobile''' travelers are "highly mobile individuals" who take "frequent trips, often over great distances." They "account for a large share of the overall kilometres travelled, especially by air."&lt;ref name="gossling"/&gt; These people contribute significantly to the overall amount of [[airmiles]] flown within a given society.&lt;ref&gt;Høyer, K. G. and Næss, P. (2001). Sustainable Tourism or Sustainable Mobility? The Norwegian Case. ''Journal of Sustainable Tourism'', 8, 147-160. ''[http://www.informaworld.com/index/908038833.pdf]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Although concerns over hypermobility apply to several modes of transport, the [[environmental impact of aviation]] and especially its [[greenhouse gas emissions]] have brought particular focus on flying.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson K, Bows A (2008).  Reframing the climate change challenge in light of post-2000 emission trends. ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences]]'' (366:1882, p.3863-3882).

(Presentation slides): Reframing climate change: from long-term targets to emission pathways. ''[http://transitionculture.org/wp-content/uploads/kevin-anderson-2.ppt]''&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons for this focus is that these emissions, because they are made at high altitude, have a climate impact that is commonly estimated to be 2.7 higher than the same emissions if made at ground-level.&lt;ref&gt;Peeters, P. &amp; Williams, V. 2009. Calculating emissions and radiative forcing. P.76 in: Gössling, S. &amp; Upham, P (Eds.), 2009. ''Climate change and aviation: Issues, challenges and solutions''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the amount of time people have spent in motion has remained constant since 1950, the shift from feet and bicycles to cars and planes has increased the speed of travel fivefold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olis.oecd.org/olis/1999doc.nsf/63c71d2d4054d0fdc125685d0053aee4/c125685b002f5004c125686b005cb510/$FILE/00071363.PDF#page=95|pages=118|author=John Adams|title=Proceedings from the Ottawa Workshop - OECD|date=19 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This results in the twin effects of wider and shallower regions of social activity around each person (further exacerbated by electronic communication which can be seen as a form of virtual mobility), and a degradation of the social and physical environment brought about by the high speed traffic (as theorised by urban designer [[Donald Appleyard]]).

The changes are brought about locally due to the use of cars and motorways, and internationally by aeroplanes.  Some of the social threats of hypermobility include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/558292.stm|title=Hypermobility: The road to ruin|date=11 December 1999|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology''' is a biomedical and genomics research institute located in New York, NY. It is housed within the [[Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai]]. Its aim is to generate and integrate many layers of biological, clinical, and environmental data in order to characterize and understand complex human diseases on a network level, and to use that data to advance information-driven medicine and to better diagnose and treat patients at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v30/n8/full/nbt.2331.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==

The institute’s primary goal is to improve patient care by building predictive models to better characterize disease. These models are constructed with multiple layers of biological data, including gene expression, metabolite, DNA, and protein information, and are combined with phenotypic and clinical data, predictive modeling, and probabilistic analysis to try to elucidate the complex mechanisms of disease.&lt;ref name="bio-itworld"&gt;http://www.bio-itworld.com/BioIT_Article.aspx?id=108466&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is called multiscale biology. To achieve this goal, scientists at the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology have outfitted facilities such as the Genomics Core with new technologies to generate many types of biological information and have placed an emphasis on hiring staff with bioinformatics expertise to analyze big data.&lt;ref name="genomeweb"&gt;http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/qa-mount-sinais-milind-mahajan-running-clia-certified-genomics-core-facility&lt;/ref&gt; Institute founding director [[Eric Schadt]] has said that this approach — along with the institute’s connection to both a hospital and medical school — is expected to lead to improved and more personalized diagnoses, assessments of risk, and treatment plans for patients.&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;

== History ==

The institute was formed in 2011. Eric Schadt was named as founding director of the new institute.&lt;ref name="bio-itworld" /&gt;

The Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology is slated to receive more than $100 million in funding in its first several years, allocated from a $1 billion capital campaign run by Mount Sinai School of Medicine.&lt;ref name="bio-itworld" /&gt;

Originally called the Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology, it was renamed in 2012 when philanthropist Carl Icahn pledged $200 million to its parent organization, the [[Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/carl-icahn-to-give-200-million-to-mount-sinai-school.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology received certification for the first [[CLIA]]-approved next-generation sequencing lab in New York City.&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="genomeweb" /&gt;

Institute faculty [[Andrew Kasarskis]], Michael Linderman, George Diaz, Ali Bashir, and Randi Zinberg taught the first class in which Mount Sinai medical students were able to fully sequence and analyze their own genomes.&lt;ref&gt;http://nygenome.org/blog/mount-sinais-genomic-training-doctors-gets-personal&lt;/ref&gt;

Institute member Joel Dudley was named one of the 100 most creative people in business in a 2014 list compiled by Fast Company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fastcompany.com/3029509/most-creative-people-2014/joel-dudley&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine said it chose Dudley "for splicing information with quality medical care."

In 2014 the institute, in collaboration with Sage Bionetworks, announced a new project aiming to genotype up to 1 million people with the goal of identifying the rare biological mechanisms that keep people healthy when they have genetic variants that should cause disease.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6187/970.full&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://resilienceproject.me/&lt;/ref&gt; The Resilience Project will scan the genomes of healthy people age 30 and older who contribute their DNA to the effort with an initial focus on 127 diseases. Scientists anticipate that finding protective mechanisms for Mendelian diseases will be more straightforward than finding ones for complex or multifactorial diseases.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/genetic-heroes-may-be-key-to-treating-debilitating-diseases/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/unexpected-heroes-resilience-project-2014-5&lt;/ref&gt; Based on an analysis of publicly available data from 600,000 human genomes, scientists involved in the Resilience Project estimate that one person in 15,000 has a mechanism protecting against disease-causing genetic variants.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/searching-for-the-genes-that-prevent-disease/371256/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Research at the institute falls into six broad disease areas:&lt;ref&gt;http://icahn.mssm.edu/departments-and-institutes/genomics&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Alzheimer's disease]]
* [[Cancer]]
* [[Asthma]] and [[allergies]]
* [[Infectious disease]]
* Psychiatric genomics
* [[Human microbiome]]

Scientists from the institute published a paper in Nature Genetics in 2012 demonstrating the ability to derive enough information from non-DNA sources to identify individuals whose supposedly anonymized biological data is stored in large research databases.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v44/n5/full/ng.2248.html&lt;/ref&gt; The authors reported that measuring RNA levels in tissue allowed them to infer a genetic barcode that could be used to match other materials to that same individual. This was noteworthy as validation of existing concerns among genomics scientists that it may not be possible to prevent the identification of an individual from genetic data even when that data is meant to be anonymous.

In a PLoS Biology paper, institute founding director Eric Schadt led a research team that utilized six different types of data (metabolite concentration, gene expression, DNA variation, DNA-protein binding, protein-metabolite interaction, and protein-protein interaction) to reconstruct networks involved in cell regulation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001301&lt;/ref&gt;

Data scientist Jeffrey Hammerbacher from [[Cloudera]] joined the institute in 2012 as an assistant professor. In an interview with [[Charlie Rose]] he said that his goal is to establish scalable infrastructure for data storage and analysis and to use that foundation to integrate genomic data with existing health records and improve the quality of health care.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/12840&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, institute scientists published a paper in the journal Cell reporting findings from a network-based study of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The researchers constructed gene regulatory networks and discovered a neural structure involved in a pathway associated with onset of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(13)00387-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute has established a research program to use predictive network modeling for personalized cancer therapy. Scientists in the program combine DNA, RNA, copy number variation, and other data from individual patients, and test some of the detected mutations in fly models. The goal is to find the driver mutations of each patient’s data and recommend specific treatments based on that information. By March 2013, the program had worked on seven cases with more planned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nygenome.org/blog/mount-sinai-cancer-tumor-study-seeks-nail-moving-targets&lt;/ref&gt; One of the cases, that of Stephanie Lee, was publicized in an article in Esquire reporting on how the scientists implanted tumor cells into a fly and then found an existing medication that knocked out the tumor in the models.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esquire.com/features/patient-zero-1213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/war-widow-finds-purpose-following-stage-4-cancer-diagnosis/&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the institute will work with Mount Sinai’s rare disorder clinic to study how single-gene diseases interact with other biomolecular processes by measuring and analyzing molecular, cellular, and tissue networks along with environmental response information.&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;

In January 2014, scientists from the institute’s Division of Psychiatric Genomics including [[Pamela Sklar]] published two papers in the journal Nature that explored the genetic complexity of schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v506/n7487/full/nature12929.html De novo mutations in schizophrenia implicate synaptic networks | Nature]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v506/n7487/full/nature12975.html A polygenic burden of rare disruptive mutations in schizophrenia | Nature]&lt;/ref&gt; The exome sequencing studies of populations in Bulgaria and Sweden revealed that the disorder is likely caused by a lot of rare genetic mutations rather than a few common mutations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bio-itworld.com/2014/1/22/maddening-genetics-schizophrenia.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/schizophrenia-could-be-caused-by-a-wide-variety-of-dna-mutations-rather-than-one-gene-9078284.html&lt;/ref&gt; The projects also established the world’s largest database on schizophrenia.

An '''interpretant''', in [[semiotics]], is the effect of a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] on someone who reads or comprehends it. The concept of "interpretant" is part of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]'s "triadic" theory of the sign. For Peirce, the interpretant is an element that allows taking a ''representamen'' for the sign of an ''object'', and is also the "effect" of the process of ''semeiosis'' or signification.

Peirce delineates three types of interpretants: the immediate, the dynamical, and the final or normal.

==Immediate Interpretant==
"The Immediate Interpretant consists in the Quality of the Impression that a sign is fit to produce, not to any actual reaction." (Letter to William James, CP 8.315, 1909)

==Dynamical Interpretant==
"[The] Dynamical Interpretant consists in direct effect actually produced by a Sign upon an Interpreter of it. [---] [The] Dynamical Interpretant is that which is experienced in each act of Interpretation and is different in each from that of the other... [it] is a single actual event." (Letter to Lady Welby, SS 110-1, 1909)

==Final or Normal Interpretant==
"[The] Final Interpretant is [...] the effect the Sign would produce in any mind upon which the circumstances should permit it to work out its full effect. [---] ...[It] is the one Interpretative result to which every Interpreter is destined to come if the Sign is sufficiently considered. [---] The Final Interpretant is that toward which the actual tends." (Letter to Lady Welby, SS 110-1, 1909)

A '''kerb crawler''' (or [[curb (road)|curb]] crawler) is a person who drives around areas known for [[street prostitution]] [[soliciting]] [[prostitution|prostitutes]] for [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. The act is known as "kerb crawling" because the person will typically drive very slowly along the [[kerb (road)|kerbside]]. 

Where prostitution is illegal, kerb crawlers are widely regarded as a [[public nuisance]]: they help keep street prostitutes in business in [[red-light district]]s and often [[solicit]] [[pedestrian]]s who are not prostitutes for sex. As a result, kerb-crawling is illegal in many [[jurisdiction]]s.

[[Sting operation]]s in which [[undercover police]] wait for kerb crawlers to [[proposition]] them are a common method for tackling kerb crawling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hill |first1=Amelia |title=The policewomen who pose as prostitutes to trap kerb crawlers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/dec/15/ukcrime.gender |website=The Guardian |accessdate=29 November 2018 |language=en |date=15 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerb crawling is illegal in [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prostitution laws around the world |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/128029/at-a-glance-prostitution-laws/ |website=Global News |accessdate=29 November 2018 |language=en |date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref name="cps" /&gt; the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=US Federal and State Prostitution Laws and Related Punishments |url=https://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000119 |website=prostitution.procon.org |publisher=ProCon.org |accessdate=29 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cook |first1=Ian |title=Research Projects |url=https://research.northumbria.ac.uk/urbanfutures/research-projects/prostitution |website=Imagining Urban Futures |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prostitution in India and it's legal analysis |url=http://www.lawyersclubindia.com/articles/Prostitution-in-India-and-it-s-legal-analysis--9151.asp |website=Lawyers Club India |accessdate=29 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police may also collect [[Vehicle registration plate|licence-plate number]]s of vehicles that appear to be kerb crawling and may contact their [[Vehicle registration|registered]] owners. 

Following the recommendations of the 1984 [[Criminal Law Revision Committee]] report ''Prostitution on the Street'', the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Sexual Offences Act 1985]] introduced an offence of kerb crawling to persistently solicit women for the purposes of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexual Offences Act 1985 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/44/pdfs/ukpga_19850044_en.pdf |website=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=29 November 2018 |quote=Section 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vulnerable"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hubbard |first1=Phil |last2=Scoular |first2=Jane |editor1-last=Canter |editor1-first=D |editor2-last=Ioannou |editor2-first=M |editor3-last=Youngs |editor3-first=D |title=Safer Sex in the City: The Experience and Management of Street Prostitution |date=2010 |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=0754626156 |pages=135-153 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1057567710373119 |language=en |chapter=Making the vulnerable more vulnerable?

==John schools==
{{main|John school}}
A John school is a form of educational intervention aimed at clients of [[prostitution|prostitutes]], who are informally known as 'johns' in North America. John schools are usually a [[diversion program]] for people - almost exclusively men - arrested for [[solicitation|soliciting]] the services of a prostitute, or another related offense. This often acts as an alternative to criminal prosecutions. However, in some jurisdictions, courts may sentence men to attend a john school program as a condition of probation.

Whether the John school is a [[diversion program]] or a sentencing condition, the client will often pay a fee to enroll. The fee frequently covers the cost of the program and sometimes contributes to programs to aid prostitutes, or community projects within [[red light districts]]. John schools often last for one day. Their focus is often on the experiences and harms of prostitution, such as the violence associated with [[prostitution]], the [[sexually transmitted disease]] risks of prostitution, and the effects of prostitution on families and communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perc.ca/PEN/1998-11/s-boddy.html "John School Helps Break the Cycle of Prostitution"] by Sharon Boddy, ''Peace and Environment News'', November 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0519,hunter,63812,5.html "School for Johns"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918062417/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0519%2Chunter%2C63812%2C5.html |date=2007-09-18 }} by Aina Hunter, ''[[Village Voice]]'', May 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}
A '''legal case''' is a dispute between opposing parties resolved by a [[court]], or by some equivalent legal process. A legal case may be either [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[criminal law]]. In each legal case there is an [[Plaintiff|accuser]] and one or more [[defendant]]s.

==Civil case==
A civil case, more commonly known as a [[lawsuit]] or [[Controversy (law)|controversy]], begins when a [[plaintiff]] [[file (legal)|files]] a document called a [[complaint]] with a court, informing the court of the wrong that the plaintiff has allegedly suffered because of the [[defendant]], and requesting a [[judicial remedy|remedy]]. The remedy sought may be money, an [[injunction]], which requires the defendant to perform or refrain from performing some action, or a [[declaratory judgment]], which determines that the plaintiff has certain legal rights. The remedy will be prescribed by the court if the plaintiff wins the case. A civil case can also be arbitrated through [[arbitration]], which may result in a faster settlement, with lower costs, than could be obtained by going through a trial. 

The plaintiff must make a genuine effort to inform the defendant of the case through [[service of process]], by which the plaintiff delivers to the defendant the same documents that the plaintiff filed with the court.

At any point during the case, the parties can agree to a [[settlement (law)|settlement]], which will end the case, although in some circumstances, such as in [[class action]]s, a settlement requires court approval in order to be binding.

===Family case===
Cases involving separation including asset division, support (a.k.a. maintenance or alimony), and matters related to children are handled differently in different jurisdictions. Often, the court's procedure for dealing with family cases is very similar to that of a civil case (it requires service and disclosure, and will issue judgments).

Divorce and separation from a spouse is one of the most stressful situations, as rated by the [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale#Adults|Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale]], and so family proceedings are increasingly being "divorced" from the often very formal and impersonal process of civil proceedings, and given special treatment.

==Criminal case==
{{Main article|Criminal case}}
[[File:CanadianCriminalCases.jpg|thumb|Canadian criminal cases]]
A [[criminal case]], in [[common law (legal system)|common law]] jurisdictions, begins when a person suspected of a crime is [[indictment|indicted]] by a grand jury or otherwise charged with the offense by a government official called a [[prosecutor]] or [[district attorney]].

A criminal case may in some jurisdictions be settled before a [[Trial (law)|trial]] through a [[plea bargain]]. Typically, in a plea bargain, the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge than that which was originally brought by the grand jury or prosecuter. A defendant who goes to trial risks greater penalties than would normally be imposed through a plea bargain.

==Common elements==
Legal cases, whether criminal or civil, are premised on the idea that a dispute will be fairly resolved when a [[legal procedure]] exists by which the dispute can be brought to a factfinder not otherwise involved in the case, who can evaluate [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to determine the truth with respect to claims of guilt, innocence, liability, or lack of fault. Details of the procedure may depend on both the kind of case and the kind of system in which the case is brought - whether, for example, it is an [[inquisitorial system]] or a solo

===Designation and citation===
&lt;!--Linked from [[Tochigi patricide case]]--&gt;
{{main|Case citation}}
In most systems, the governing body responsible for overseeing the courts assigns a unique number/letter combination or similar designation to each case in order to track the various disputes that are or have been before it. The outcome of the case is recorded, and can later be reviewed by obtaining a copy of the documents associated with the designation previously assigned to the case.

However, it is often more convenient to refer to cases{{spaced ndash}}particularly landmark and other notable cases{{spaced ndash}}by a title of the form ''Claimant [[wikt:v.|v]] Defendant'' (e.g. ''[[Arkell v Pressdram]]'').  Where a legal proceeding does not have formally designated adverse parties, a form such as ''[[In re]]'', ''Re'' or ''In the matter of'' is used (e.g. ''[[In re Gault]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford University Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities |url=http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/publications/oscola.php |publisher=Hart Publishers |edition=4 |year=2012 |isbn=9781849463676}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "v" separating the parties is an abbreviation of the Latin [[wikt:versus|versus]], but, when spoken in [[Commonwealth countries]], it is normally rendered as "[[wikt:and|and]]" or "[[wikt:against|against]]" (as in, for example, [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'').  Where it is considered necessary to protect the anonymity of a [[natural person]], some cases may have one or both parties replaced by a standard pseudonym ([[John Doe|Jane Roe]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'') or by an initial (''[[D v D]]'').  In titles such as ''[[R v Adams]]'', however, the initial "R" is usually an abbreviation for the Latin [[King|Rex]] or [[Queen regnant|Regina]], i.e. for [[the Crown]]. (For an explanation of other terms that may appear in case titles, see the [[Glossary of legal terms]].)

'''MarBEF Data System''' (Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning) was a project of the [[European Union]]'s [[Network of Excellence]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://cordis.europa.eu/fp6/instr_noe.htm Network of Excellence]''&lt;/ref&gt; which served as a platform to integrate and disseminate knowledge and expertise on marine [[biodiversity]], with informative links to researchers, industry, stakeholders and the general public. The program was funded by the EU and formally ended in 2009.&lt;ref name="marbeone"/&gt; The data system's online '''Register of Resources''' (RoR) includes the details of over 1,000 European [[marine biology]] experts and their affiliated institutions and publications.&lt;ref name="EuroMarine"/&gt;

MarBEF consisted of 94 [[Europe|European]] marine institutes and the work done was published in 415 scientific articles.&lt;ref name="clamereu"/&gt; While the initial MarBEF project has ended, work continues through numerous projects within the MarBEF "umbrella" including, the '''European Ocean Biogeographic Information System''', the '''European Register of Marine Species''', the '''''European Marine Gazetteer''''', and includes a related '''Marine Biodiversity''' Wiki and '''MarBEF Open Archive'''.&lt;ref name="EuroMarine"/&gt;

==Organization history==
===Founding===
The program was funded by the [[European Union]] (EU), with [[Euro|€]]8,707,000 coming from the [[European Commission]] and having a total cost of €8,782,025.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/pdf/project_summaries/fp6/marine_environment/marbef.pdf|title=MarBEF|publisher=European Commission: Marine &amp; Coastal Research|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was a framework for marine entities, intended to integrate and disseminate the knowledge on [[marine biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marbef.org/modules.php?name=Description Overview of MarBEF goals]&lt;/ref&gt; It was funded by the [[Sixth Framework Programme]] of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marbef.org MarBEF website]&lt;/ref&gt; MarBEF consisted of 94 [[Europe|European]] marine institutes from 24 countries and was coordinated by the Dutch Institute for Ecology (NIOO).&lt;ref name="EC"/&gt; 

To accomplish its goals MarBEF participated in and/or supported multiple conferences and [[Academic conference|workshops]] to educate and strengthen collaboration between members of the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurocoml.org/news/archive-news/coml-marbef-eurocoml-modelling-workshop|title=CoML-MarBEF-EuroCoML modelling workshop|publisher=European Census of Marine Life|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marine-biodiversity.org/endorsing/|title=Endorsing Organisations|publisher=World Conference on Marine Biodiversity|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent years and end===
{{expand section|date=March 2015}}
The program formally ended in 2009.&lt;ref name="marbeone"/&gt;
While the initial MarBEF project has ended, work continues through numerous projects within the MarBEF "umbrella" including, the European Ocean Biogeographic Information System, the European Register of Marine Species, the ''European Marine Gazetteer'', and includes a related Marine Biodiversity [[Wiki]] and MarBEF Open Archive.&lt;ref name="EuroMarine"/&gt; 

==Related projects==

{{expand section|date=March 2015}}
This project continued after the end of MarBEF in 2009.&lt;ref name="EuroMarine"/&gt; 

===''European Marine Gazetteer''===
''European Marine Gazetteer'' was the MarBEF database of geographic co ck(names, information, maps), made available for download by the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marbef.org/data/gazetteer.php?p=browser European Marine Gazetteer webpage] &lt;/ref&gt;

===European Register of Marine Species (ERMS)===
The European Register of Marine Species (commonly known by the [[acronym]] ERMS) is an authoritative [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] list of species occurring in the European [[marine environment]]. The ERMS was founded in 1998 by grant from the EU's ''[http://cordis.europa.eu/mast/ Marine Science and Technology Programme]'' and the project covers species of the [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] [[Animalia]], [[Plantae]], [[Fungi]] and [[Protoctista]] occurring in the marine environment over a wide geographic range. The marine area within the scope of the ERMS includes the [[continental shelf]] seas of Europe as well as the [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean]] shelf, [[Baltic Sea]]s and [[deep-sea]] areas.&lt;ref name="ERMS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marbef.org/data/erms.php|title=The European Register of Marine Species|publisher=MarBEF|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database contains the records of tens of thousands of marine species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marbef.org/data/aphia.php?p=stats|title=Statistics|publisher=MarBEF|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;ERMS executive committee
The executive committee of the project includes: Dr. Mark Costello (Chief editor) of the [[University of Auckland]], Prof. Philippe Bouchet of the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle]], Prof. Geoff Boxshall of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], and Mr. Ward Appeltans from [[UNESCO]]'s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.&lt;ref name="ERMS"/&gt;

====World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS)====
{{Main|World Register of Marine Species}}
The [[World Register of Marine Species]] grew out of the ERMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinespecies.org/about.php|title=About|publisher=World Register of Marine Species|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily funded by the [[European Union]] and hosted by the [[Flanders Marine Institute]] in [[Ostend]], Belgium.  WoRMS has established formal agreements with several other biodiversity projects, including the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]] and the [[Encyclopedia of Life]]. In 2008, WoRMS stated that it hoped to have an up-to-date record of all marine species completed by 2010, the year in which the [[Census of Marine Life]] was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14206-how-many-species-live-in-the-sea.html|title=How many species live in the sea? |date=2008-06-25 |author=Catherine Brahic|publisher=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moral Development''' focuses on the emergence, change, and understanding of [[morality]] from infancy through adulthood. Morality develops across a lifetime and is influenced by an individual's experiences and their behavior when faced with moral issues through different periods' physical and cognitive development. In short, morality concerns an individual's growing sense of what is right and wrong; it is for this reason that young children have different moral judgement and character than that of a grown adult. Morality in itself is often a synonym for "rightness" or "goodness". It refers to a certain code of conduct that is derived from one's culture, religion or personal philosophy that guides one's actions, behaviors and thoughts.  

Notions of morality development have been developed over centuries, the earliest came from philosophers like [[Confucius]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], who all took a more humanist perspective and focused on the development of the conscience and sense of virtue. In the modern day, empirical research has explored morality through a moral psychology lens by theorists like [[Sigmund Freud]] and its relation to cognitive development by theorists like [[Jean Piaget]], [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], [[B. F. Skinner]], [[Carol Gilligan]] and Judith Smetana.  

The interest in morality spans many disciplines (e.g., [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[biology]], and [[political science]]) and specializations within psychology (e.g., [[Social psychology|social]], [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]], and [[Cultural psychology|cultural]]). In order to investigate how individuals understand morality, it is essential to consider their beliefs, emotions, attitudes, and behaviors that contribute to their moral understanding. Additionally, researchers in the field of moral development consider the role of peers and parents in facilitating moral development, the role of conscience and values, socialization and cultural influences, empathy and altruism, and positive development, in order to understand what factors impact morality of an individual more completely.

==Historical background and foundational theories ==

'''Freud: Morality and the Superego:''' The founder of psychoanalysis, [[Sigmund Freud]], proposed the existence of a tension between the needs of society and the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Eli. ''Freud, Women, and Morality: The Psychology of Good and Evil''. New York: Basic Books, 1988. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Freud, moral development proceeds when the individual's selfish desires are repressed and replaced by the values of important socializing agents in one's life (for instance, one's parents).

'''B.F. Skinner's Behavioral Theory:''' A proponent of behaviorism, [[B. F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner]] similarly focused on socialization as the primary force behind moral development&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Driscoll, Marcy Perkins. ''Psychology of Learning for Instruction''. Pearson, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;. In contrast to Freud's notion of a struggle between internal and external forces, Skinner focused on the power of external forces (reinforcement contingencies) to shape an individual's development.

'''Piaget's Theory of Moral Development''' : While both Freud and Skinner focused on the external forces that bear on morality (parents in the case of Freud, and behavioral contingencies in the case of Skinner), [[Jean Piaget]] (1965) focused on the individual's construction, construal, and interpretation of morality from a social-cognitive and social-emotional perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, Jean, Ved P. Varma, and Phillip Williams. ''Piaget, Psychology and Education: Papers in Honour of Jean Piaget''. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;To understand adult morality, Piaget believed that it was necessary to study both how morality manifests in the child's world as well as the factors that contribute to the emergence of central moral concepts such as welfare, justice, and rights. Interviewing children using the Clinical Interview Method, Piaget (1965) found that young children were focused on authority mandates, and that with age children become autonomous, evaluating actions from a set of independent principles of morality. Piaget characterizes the development of morality of children through observing children while playing games to see if rules are followed.
[[File:Jean Piaget in Ann Arbor.png|thumb|212x212px|[[Jean Piaget]].]]

'''Social Domain Theory:''' Eliot Turiel  argued for a social domain approach to social cognition, delineating how individuals differentiate moral (fairness, equality, justice), societal (conventions, group functioning, traditions), and psychological (personal, individual prerogative) concepts from early in development throughout the lifespan&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, Elliot. ''The Culture of Morality: Social Development, Context, and Conflict''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. Internet resource.&lt;/ref&gt;. Over the past 40 years, research findings have supported this model, demonstrating how children, adolescents, and adults differentiate moral rules from conventional rules, identify the personal domain as a nonregulated domain, and evaluate multifaceted (or complex) situations that involve more than one domain. This research has been conducted in a wide range of countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Nigeria, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, U.K., U.S., Virgin Islands) and with rural and urban children, for low and high income communities, and traditional and modern cultures. Turiel's social domain theory showed that children were actually younger in developing moral standards than past psychologists predicted.

'''Kohlberg: Moral Reasoning'':''''' [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] was inspired by the works of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohlberg, Lawrence. ''The Philosophy of Moral Development: Moral Stages and the Idea of Justice''. San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1981. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the past 20 years, researchers have expanded the field of moral development, applying moral judgment, reasoning, and emotion attribution to topics such as prejudice, aggression, theory of mind, emotions, empathy, peer relationships, and parent-child interactions. The Handbook of Moral Development (2006), edited by Melanie Killen and Judith Smetana, provides a wide range of information about these topics covered in moral development today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Smetana, J.G. (Eds.) (2006). Handbook of moral development. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;One of the main objectives was to provide a sense of the current state of the field of moral development

==Cognition and intentionality==

A hallmark of moral understanding is intentionality which can be defined as an attribution of the target’s intentions towards another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Killen|first=Melanie|last2=Rizzo|first2=Michael T.|date=2014|title=Morality, Intentionality, and Intergroup Attitudes |journal=Behaviour|volume=151|issue=2–3|pages=337–359|doi=10.1163/1568539X-00003132 |pmc=4336952|pmid=25717199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Five components make up people's concept of intentionality: an action is considered intentional if a personal has (a) a desire for an outcome, (b) a belief that the action will lead to the outcome, (c) an intention to perform the action, (d) skill to perform the action, and (e) awareness while performing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://research.clps.brown.edu/SocCogSci/Projects/intentionality.html|title=Intentionality {{!}} Malle Lab|website=research.clps.brown.edu|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research on children's [[theory of mind]], ToM, has focused on when children understand others' intentions (Wellman &amp; Lui, 2004&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, H. M., &amp; Liu, D. (2004). Scaling of theory-of-mind tasks. ''Child Development'', 75, 502-517.&lt;/ref&gt;). The moral concept of one's intentionality develops with experience in the world. Yuill (1984) presented evidence that comprehension of one's intentions plays a role in moral judgment, even in young children.&lt;ref&gt;Yuill, N. (1984). Young children's coordination of motive and outcome in judgments of satisfaction and morality. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 2, 73-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Killen, Mulvey, Richardson, Jampol, and [[Amanda Woodward|Woodward]] (2011) present evidence that with developing false belief competence (ToM), children are capable of using information about one’s intentions when making moral judgments about the acceptability of acts and punishments, recognizing that accidental transgressors, who do not hold negative intentions, should not be held accountable for negative outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Mulvey, K. L., Richardson, C., Jampol, N., &amp; Woodward, A. (2011). The accidental transgressor: Testing theory of mind and morality knowledge in young children. ''Cognition'', 119, 197-215.&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, children who lacked false belief competence were more likely to attribute blame to an accidental transgressor than children with demonstrated false belief competence. In addition to evidence from a social cognitive perspective, behavioral evidence suggests that even three-year-olds have the capacity to take into account a person's intention and apply this information when responding to situations. Vaish, Carpenter, and [[Michael Tomasello|Tomasello]] (2010), for instance, present evidence that three-year-olds are more willing to help a neutral or helpful person than a harmful person.&lt;ref&gt;Vaish, A., Carpenter, M., &amp; Tomasello, M. (2010). Young children selectively avoid helping people with harmful intentions. ''Child Development'', 81, 1661-1669.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the ability to identify one’s intentionality, mental state understanding plays a crucial role in identifying victimization. While obvious distress cues (e.g. crying) allow even three year olds to identify victims of harm (Zelazo, Helwig, &amp; Lau, 1996&lt;ref&gt;Zelazo, P. D., Helwig, C. C., &amp; Lau, A. (1996). Intention, act, and outcome in behavioral prediction and moral judgment. ''Child Development'', 67, 2478-2492.&lt;/ref&gt;), it is not until around six years of age that children are able to appreciate that a person may be an unwilling victim of harm even in the absence of obvious distress (Shaw &amp; Wainryb, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, L. A., &amp; Wainryb, C. (2006). When victims don't cry: Children's understandings of victimization, compliance, and subversion. ''Child Development'', 77, 1050-1062.&lt;/ref&gt; In their study, Shaw and Wainryb (2006) discovered that children older than six interpret compliance, resistance, and subversion to illegitimate requests (e.g., clean my locker) from the perspective of a victim. That is, they judge that victims who resist illegitimate requests will feel better than victims who comply.

==Emotions==

Moral questions tend to be emotionally charged issues which evoke strong affective responses. Consequently, emotions likely play an important role in moral development. However, there is currently little consensus among theorists on how emotions influence moral development. [[Psychoanalytic theory]], founded by Freud, emphasizes the role of guilt in repressing primal drives. Research on [[prosocial behavior]] has focused on how emotions motivate individuals to engage in moral or altruistic acts. Social-cognitive development theories have recently begun to examine how emotions influence moral judgments. Intuitionist theorists assert that moral judgments can be reduced to immediate, instinctive emotional responses elicited by moral dilemmas.

Research on socioemotional development and prosocial development has identified several "moral emotions" which are believed to motivate moral behavior and influence moral development (Eisenberg, 2000 for a review).&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N. (2000). Emotion, Regulation, and Moral Development. ''Annual Review of Psychology'', 51,665–697.&lt;/ref&gt; These moral emotions are said to be linked to moral development because they are evidence and reflective of an individual’s set of moral values, which must have undergone through the process of internalization in the first place (Kochanska &amp; Thompson, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kochanska|first=Grazyna|last2=Aksan|first2=Nazan|date=2006-12-01|title=Children's Conscience and Self-Regulation|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00421.x|journal=Journal of Personality|language=en|volume=74|issue=6|pages=1587–1618|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00421.x|issn=1467-6494}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifestation of these moral emotions can occur at two separate timings: either before or after the execution of a moral or immoral act. A moral emotion that precedes an action is referred to as an anticipatory emotion, and a moral emotion that follows an action is referred to as a consequential emotion (Tangney, Stuewig, &amp; Mashek, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tangney|first=June Price|last2=Stuewig|first2=Jeff|last3=Mashek|first3=Debra J.|date=2006-12-06|title=Moral Emotions and Moral Behavior|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=58|issue=1|pages=345–372|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145|issn=0066-4308|pmc=3083636}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary emotions consistently linked with moral development are [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[empathy]], and [[sympathy]]. Guilt has been defined as "an agitation-based emotion or painful feeling of regret that is aroused when the actor actually causes, anticipates causing, or is associated with an aversive event" (Fergusen &amp; Stegge, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson T. J. &amp; Stegge H. (1998). Measuring guilt in children: a rose by any other name still has thorns. In Guilt and Children, ed. J Bybee, pp. 19–74. San Diego: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; Shame is often used synonymously with guilt, but implies a more passive and dejected response to a perceived wrong. Guilt and shame are considered "self-conscious" emotions, because they are of primary importance to an individual's self-evaluation. Moreover, there exists a bigger difference between guilt and shame that goes beyond the type of feelings that they may provoke within an individual. This difference lies in the fact that these two moral emotions do not weigh the same in terms of their impact on moral behaviors. Studies on the effects of guilt and shame on moral behaviors has shown that guilt has a larger ability to dissuade an individual from making immoral choices whereas shame did not seem to have any deterring effect on immoral behaviors. However, it should be noted that different types of behaviors in different types of population, under different circumstances might not generate the same outcomes (Tangney, Stuewig, &amp; Mashek, 2007). In contrast to guilt and shame, empathy and sympathy are considered other-oriented moral emotions. Empathy is commonly defined as an affective response produced by the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state which mirrors the other's affective state. Similarly, sympathy is defined as an emotional response produced by the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state which does not mirror the other's affect, but instead causes one to express concern or sorrow for the other (Eisenberg, 2000).

The relation between moral action and moral emotions has been extensively researched. Very young children have been found to express feelings of care, and empathy towards others, showing concerns for other's well being (Eisenberg, Spinard, &amp; Sadovsky, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., Spinard, T. L., &amp; Sadovsky, A. (2006). Empathy-related responding in children. In M. Killen &amp; J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 517-549). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has consistently demonstrated that when empathy is induced in an individual, he or she is more likely to engage in subsequent prosocial behavior (Batson 1998;&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (1998). Altruism and prosocial behavior. In The Handbook of Social Psychology, ed. DT Gilbert, ST Fiske, G Lindzey, 2:282–316. Boston: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenberg, 200 for review). Additionally, other research has examined emotions of shame and guilt in relation to children's empathic and prosocial behavior (Zahn-Waxler &amp; Robinson, 1995).

While emotions serve as information for children in their interpretations about moral consequences of acts, the role of emotions in children's moral judgments has only recently been investigated. Some approaches to studying emotions in moral judgments come from the perspective that emotions are automatic intuitions that define morality (Greene, 2001;&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J. (2001). An fMRI Investigation of Emotional Engagement in Moral Judgment. ''Science'', 293 (5537), 2105-2108. {{doi|10.1126/science.1062872}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haidt, 2001&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2001). The emotional dog and its rational tail: A social intuitionist approach to moral judgment. ''Psychological Review'', 108, 814-834.&lt;/ref&gt;). Other approaches place emphasis on the role of emotions as evaluative feedback that help children interpret acts and consequences (Turiel &amp; Killen, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, E., &amp; Killen, M. (2010). Taking emotions seriously: The role of emotions in moral development. In W. Arsenio &amp; E. Lemerise (Eds.), Emotions in aggression and moral development. (pp. 33-52). Washington, D.C.: APA.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown children attribute different emotional outcomes to actors involved in moral transgressions than those involved in conventional transgressions (Arsenio, 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Arsenio, W. F. (1988). Children's conceptions of the situational affective consequences of sociomoral events. ''Child Development'', 59, 1611-1622.&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenio &amp; Fleiss, 1996&lt;ref&gt;Arsenio, W. F., &amp; Fleiss, K. (1996). Typical and behaviourally disruptive children's understanding of the emotional consequences of socio-moral events. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 14, 173-186&lt;/ref&gt;). Emotions may help individuals prioritize among different information and possibilities and reduce information processing demands in order to narrow the scope of the reasoning process (Lemerise &amp; Arsenio, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Lemerise, E., &amp; Arsenio, W. (2000). An integrated model of emotion processes and cognition in social information processing. ''Child Development'', 71, 107-118.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Malti, Gummerum, Keller, &amp; Buchmann, (2009) found individual differences in how children attribute emotions to victims and victimizers.&lt;ref&gt;Malti, T., Gummerum, M., Keller, M., &amp; Buchmann, M. (2009). Children's moral motivation, sympathy, and prosocial behavior. ''Child Development'', 80, 442-460.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of interpersonal, intergroup, and cultural influences==
Children's interactions and experiences with caregivers and peers have been shown to influence their development of moral understanding and behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/early-childhood-moral-development/|title=Early Childhood Moral Development|website=www.mentalhelp.net|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;Researchers have addressed the influence of interpersonal interactions on children's moral development from two primary perspectives: Socialization/Internalization (Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994;&lt;ref&gt;Grusec, J. E., &amp; Goodnow, J. J. (1994). Impact of parental discipline methods on the child's internalization of values: A reconceptualization of current points of view. ''Developmental Psychology'', 30, 4-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Kochanska &amp; Askan, 1995;&lt;ref&gt;Kochanska, G., &amp; Aksan, N. (1995). Mother-child mutually positive affect, the quality of child compliance to requests and prohibitions, and maternal control as correlates of early internalization. ''Child Development'', 66, 236-254.&lt;/ref&gt; Kochanska, Askan, &amp; Koenig, 1995&lt;ref&gt;Kochanska, G., Aksan, N., &amp; Koenig, A. L. (1995). A longitudinal study of the roots of preschoolers' conscience: Committed compliance and emerging internalization. ''Child Development'', 66, 1752-176&lt;/ref&gt;) and social domain theory.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"&gt;Turiel, E. (1983). The development of social knowledge: Morality and convention. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smetana, J. G. (2006). Social-cognitive domain theory: Consistencies and variations in children's moral and social judgments. In M. Killen, &amp; J. G. Smetana (Ed.), Handbook of Moral Development (pp. 19-154). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nucci, L. (2008). Moral development and moral education: An overview.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research from the social domain theory perspective focuses on how children actively distinguish moral from conventional behavior based in part on the responses of parents, teachers, and peers.&lt;ref&gt;Smetana, J. G. (1997). Parenting and the development of social knowledge reconceptualized: A social domain analysis. In J. E. Grusec &amp; L. Kuczynski (Eds.), Parenting and the internalization of values (pp. 162-192). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Social domain suggests that there are different areas of reasoning co-existing in development those include societal (concerns about conventions and grouping), moral (fairness, justice and rights) and psychological (concerns with personal goals and identity).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Turiel|first=E|date=2007|chapter=The Development of Morality |editors=W. Damon, R. M. Lerner and N. Eisenberg|url=|title=Handbook of Child Psychology|volume=3|edition=6th|doi=10.1002/9780470147658.chpsy0313 |isbn=9780471272878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults tend to respond to children's moral transgressions (e.g. hitting or stealing) by drawing the child's attention to the effect of his or her action on others, and doing so consistently across various contexts. In contrast, adults are more likely to respond to children's conventional misdeeds (e.g. wearing a hat in the classroom, eating spaghetti with fingers) by reminding children about specific rules and doing so only in certain contexts (e.g. at school but not at home).&lt;ref name=Smetana1984&gt;Smetana, J. G. (1984). Toddlers' social interactions regarding moral and conventional transgressions. ''Child Development'', 55, 1767-1776.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smetana, J. G. (1985). Preschool children's conceptions of transgressions: Effects of varying moral and conventional domain-related attributes. ''Developmental Psychology'', 21, 18-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Peers respond mainly to moral but not conventional transgressions and demonstrate emotional distress (e.g. crying or yelling) when they are the victim of moral but unconventional transgressions.&lt;ref name=Smetana1984/&gt; 

Research from a socialization/internalization perspective focuses on the ways in which adults pass down standards or rules of behavior to children through parenting techniques and why children do or do not internalize those values (Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994; Kochanska &amp; Askan, 1995). From this perspective, moral development involves children's increasing compliance with and internalization of adult rules, requests, and standards of behavior. Using these definitions, researchers find that parenting behaviors vary in the extent to which they encourage children's internalization of values, and that these effects depend partially on a child attributes, such as age and [[temperament]] (Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994). For instance, Kochanska (1997) showed that gentle parental discipline best promotes conscience development in temperamentally fearful children but that parental responsiveness and a mutually responsive parent-child orientation best promote conscience development in temperamentally fearless children.&lt;ref&gt;Kochanska, G. (1997). Multiple pathways to conscience for children with different temperaments: From toddlerhood to age 5. ''Developmental Psychology'', 33, 228-240.&lt;/ref&gt; These parental influences exert their effects through multiple pathways, including increasing children's experience of moral emotions (e.g. guilt, empathy) and their self-identification as moral individuals (Kochanska, 2010&lt;ref&gt;Kochanska, G., Koenig, J. L., Barry, R. A., Kim, S., &amp; Yoon, J. E. (2010). Children's conscience during toddler and preschool years, moral self, and a competent, adaptive developmental trajectory. ''Developmental Psychology'', 46, 1320-1332&lt;/ref&gt;). Development can be divided up to multiple stages however the first few years of development is usually seen to be formed by 5 years of age. According to Freud's research, relationships between a child and parents early on usually provides the basis forth personality development as well as the formation of morality. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Freud|first=S|date=1930-1961|title=Civilization and its Discontents|url=|location=New York, NY|volume=|pages=|publisher=W. W. Norton.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers interested in intergroup attitudes and behavior related to ones moral development have approached the study of [[stereotypes]], [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] in children and adolescents from several theoretical perspectives. Some, however not limited to are of these theoretical frameworks: Cognitive Development Theory (Aboud, 1988);&lt;ref&gt;Aboud, F. E. (1988). Children and prejudice. Oxford, England: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Social Domain Theory (Killen &amp; Rutland, 2011;&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Rutland, A. (2011). Children and social exclusion: Morality, prejudice, and group identity. NY: Wiley/Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Killen, Sinno, &amp; Margie, 2007&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Sinno, S., &amp; Margie, N. G. (2007). Children's experiences and judgments about group exclusion and inclusion. In R. V. Kail (Ed.), Advances in child development and behavior (pp. 173-218). New York: Elseveir.&lt;/ref&gt;); [[Social identity theory|Social Identity Development Theory]] (Nesdale, 1999);&lt;ref&gt;Nesdale, D. (1999). Developmental changes in children's ethnic preferences and social cognition. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 20, 501-519&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental Intergroup Theory (Bigler &amp; Liben, 2006);&lt;ref&gt;Bigler, R. S., &amp; Liben, L. (2006). A developmental intergroup theory of social stereotypes and prejudice. In R. Kail (Ed.), Advances in child psychology (pp. 39-90). New York: Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt; Subjective Group Dynamics (Abrams, Rutland, &amp; Cameron, 2003;&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, D., Rutland, A., Cameron, L., &amp; Marques, J. (2003). The development of subjective group dynamics: When in-group bias gets specific. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 21, 155-176&lt;/ref&gt; Rutland, Killen, &amp; Abrams, 2010&lt;ref&gt;Rutland, A., Killen, M., &amp; Abrams, D. (2010). A new social-cognitive developmental perspective on prejudice: The interplay between morality and group identity. ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'', 5, 280-291.&lt;/ref&gt;); Implicit Theories (Levy, Chiu, &amp; Hong, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Levy, S. R., Chiu, C. Y., &amp; Hong, Y. Y. (2006). Lay theories and intergroup relations. Group Processes and Intergroup Relations., 9, 5-24&lt;/ref&gt; and Intergroup-contact Theory (Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, T. F., &amp; Tropp, L. R. (2008). How does intergroup contact reduce prejudice? Meta-analytic tests of three mediators. ''European Journal of Social Psychology'', 38, 922-934. {{doi|10.1002/ejsp.504}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plethora of research approaches is not surprising given the multitude of variables, (e.g. group identity, group status, group threat, group [[Norm (social)|norms]], [[Contact hypothesis|intergroup contact]], individual beliefs and context) that need to be considered when assessing children's intergroup attitudes. While most of this research has investigated two-dimensional relationships between each of the three components: stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination (e.g., role of stereotypes in intergroup prejudice, use of stereotypes to reason about intergroup discrimination, how prejudices manifest into discrimination), very few have addressed all three aspects of intergroup attitudes and behaviors together (McKown, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;McKown, C. (2004). Age and ethnic variation in children's thinking about the nature of racism. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 25, 597-617. {{doi|10.1016/j.appdev.2004.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developmental intergroup research, stereotypes are defined as judgments made about an individual's attributes based on group membership (Killen, Margie, &amp; Sinno, 2006;&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Margie, N. G., &amp; Sinno, S. (2006). Morality in the context of intergroup relationships. In M. Killen &amp; J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 155-183). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Killen et al., 2007). These judgments are more complex than regular judgments as they require one to recognize and understand (eg. gender, race, religion, culture, nationality, ethnicity) which group one individual belongs to as they might be treated differently delliberately because of the group they are associated with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social psychologists focus on stereotypes as a cognitive component influencing intergroup behaviors and tend to define them as being fixed concepts associated with a category (Allport, 1954).&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W. (1954). The nature of prejudice. Reading, MA: Addison Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; Prejudice, on the other hand is defined in terms of negative attitudes or affective expressions toward a whole group or members of a group (Stangor, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Stangor, C. (2009). The study of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination within social psychology: A quick history of theory and research. In T. D. Nelson (Ed.), Handbook of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. (pp. 1-22). New York, NY US: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative stereotypes and prejudices can manifest into discrimination towards an outgroup and for children and adolescents, this may come in the form of exclusion from peer groups as well as the wider community (Killen &amp; Rutland, 2011). Such actions can negatively impact a child in the long term in the sense of weakening ones confidence, self esteem as well personal identity. 

One explicit manner in which societies can socialize individuals is through moral education. Solomon and colleagues (1988) present evidence from a study that integrated both direct instruction and guided reflection approaches to moral development, with evidence for resultant increases in spontaneous prosocial behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, D., Watson, M. S., Delucchi, K. L., Schaps, E., &amp; Battistich, V. (1988). Enhancing children's prosocial behavior in the classroom. American Educational Research Journal, 25, 527-554.&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture can also be a key contributor toward differences in morality within society.&lt;ref name="Social and personality development"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaffer|first1=David R.|title=Social and personality development|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|page=357|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosocial behavior, which is behavior that benefits others, is much more likely in societies with strong social goals rather than societies which emphasize the individual. For example, children being raised in China eventually adopt the collective communist ideals of their society. In fact, children learn to lie and deny responsibility for accomplishing something good instead of seeking recognition for their actions.&lt;ref name="Social and personality development" /&gt; Early indications of prosocial behavior include the sharing of toys and comforting distressed friends, and these characteristics can be seen in an individual’s behavior as young as infancy and toddlerhood.  Starting in preschool, sharing, helping, and other prosocial behaviors become more common, particularly in females, although the gender differences in prosocial behavior are not evident in all social contexts.&lt;ref name="Social and personality development"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaffer|first1=David R.|title=Social and personality development|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|page=357|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral relativism ===
[[Moral relativism]], also called “cultural relativism,” suggests that morality is relative to each culture. One cannot rightly pass moral judgement on members of other cultures except by their own cultural standards when actions violate a moral principle, which may differ from one’s own. [[Richard Shweder|Shweder]], Mahapatra, and Miller (1987) argued for the notion that different cultures defined the boundaries of morality differently.&lt;ref&gt;Shweder, R. A., Mahapatra, M., &amp; Miller, J. G. (1987). Culture and moral development In J. Kagan &amp; S. Lamb (Eds.), The emergence of morality in young children. (pp.1-83). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also different from [[moral subjectivism]] which refers to the view that moral truth is relative to the individual. Moral relativism can be identified as a form of [[moral skepticism]] and is often misidentified as [[moral pluralism]]. It opposes to the attitude of moral superiority and ethnocentrism found in [[moral absolutism]] and the views of [[moral universalism]]. Turiel and Perkins (2004) argued for the universality of morality, focusing largely on evidence throughout history of resistance movements that fight for justice through the affirmation of individual self-determination rights.&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, E. &amp; Perkins, S. A. (2004). Flexibilities of mind: Conflict and culture. Human Development, 47, 158-178.&lt;/ref&gt;Miller (2006) proposes that there is cultural variability in the priority given to moral considerations (e.g., the importance of prosocial helping).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. G. (2006). Insights into moral development from cultural psychology. In M. Killen &amp; J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 375-398). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than variability in what individuals consider moral (fairness, justice, rights). Wainryb (2006), in contrast, demonstrates that children in diverse cultures such as the U.S., India, China, Turkey, and Brazil share a pervasive view about upholding fairness and the wrongfulness of inflicting armong others.&lt;ref&gt;Wainryb, C. (2006). Moral development in culture: Diversity, tolerance, and justice. In M. Killen &amp; J.G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of Moral Development (pp. 211-242). NY: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultures vary in terms of conventions and customs, but not principles of fairness, which appear to emerge very early in development, prior to socialization influences. Wainryb (1991; 1993) shows that many apparent cultural differences in moral judgments are actually due to different informational assumptions, or beliefs about the way the world works.&lt;ref&gt;Wainryb, C. (1991). Understanding differences in moral judgments: The role of informational assumptions. ''Child Development'', 62, 840-851.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wainryb, C. (1993). The application of moral judgments to other cultures: Relativism and universality. ''Child Development'', 64, 924-933.&lt;/ref&gt;  When people hold different beliefs about the effects of actions or the status of different groups of people, their judgments about the harmfulness or fairness of behaviors often differ, even when they are applying the same moral principles. 

=== Religion ===
The role of religion in a culture may influence a child's moral development and sense of moral identity. Values are transmitted through [[religion]], which is for many inextricably linked to a cultural identity. [[Religious development]] often goes along with moral development of the children as it shapes the child's concepts of right and wrong. Intrinsic aspects of religion may have a positive impact on the internalization and the symbolism of moral identity. The child may internalize the parents' morals if a religion is a family activity or the religious social group's morals to which the child belongs. Religious development mirrors the cognitive and moral developmental stages of the children. Nucci and Turiel (1993), on the other hand, proposed that the development of morality is distinct from the understanding of religious rules when assessing individuals' reactions to whether moral and nonmoral religious rules was contingent to God's word and whether a harmful act could be justified as morally right based on God's commands.&lt;ref&gt;Nucci, L. P., &amp; Turiel, E. (1993). God's word, religious rules and their relation to Christian and Jewish children's concepts of morality. ''Child Development'', 64, 1485-1491.&lt;/ref&gt; Children form their own understanding of how they see the world, themselves or others and are able to understand that not all religious rules are applied to morality, social structures or different religions. 

===In indigenous American communities===

In [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American communities]], morality is taught to children through [[storytelling]]. It provides children guidelines for understanding the core values of their community, the significance of life and ideologies of moral character from past generations. &lt;ref name="Howard 1999 45–53"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard|first=Scott J.|title=Contemporary American Indian storytelling: An outsider's perspective|journal=American Indian Quarterly|date=1999|volume=23|pages=45–53|doi=10.2307/1185925|jstor=1185925}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Storytelling]] shapes the minds of young children in these communities as well as forms the dominant means for understanding and the basic foundation for learning and teaching.  

[[Storytelling]] in everyday life is used as an [[Informal learning|indirect form of teaching]]. Stories embedded with lessons of morals, ideals, and ethics are told alongside daily household chores. Most children in Indigenous American communities develop a sense of keen [[attention]] to the details of a story with the goal of learning from them, and to understand why people do the things they do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaskins|first=Suzanne|title=Open Attention as a Cultural Tool for Observational Learning|url=http://kellogg.nd.edu/learning/Gaskins.pdf|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding gained from a child's observation of morality and ethics taught through storytelling allows them to participate within their community appropriately.

Specific animals are used as characters to symbolize specific values and views of the culture in the [[storytelling]] where listeners are taught through the actions of these characters. In the [[Lakota tribe]], coyotes are often viewed as a trickster character, demonstrating negative behaviors like greed, recklessness, and arrogance &lt;ref name="Howard 1999 45–53"/&gt; while bears and foxes are usually viewed as wise, noble, and morally upright characters from which children learn to model .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.native-languages.org/legends.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the stories, trickster characters often get into troubles, thus teaching children to avoid exhibiting similar negative behaviors. The reuse of characters calls for a more predictable outcome that children can more easily understand.

===Social exclusion===

Intergroup exclusion context provides an appropriate platform to investigate the interplay of these three dimensions of intergroup attitudes and behaviors, prejudice, stereotypes and discrimination. Developmental scientists working from a Social Domain Theory (SDT: Killen et al., 2006; Smetana, 2006) perspective have focused on methods that measure children's reasoning about exclusion scenarios. This approach has been helpful in distinguishing which concerns children attend to when presented with a situation in which exclusion occurs. Exclusion from a peer group could raise concerns about moral issues (e.g. fairness and empathy towards excluded), social-conventional issues (e.g., traditions and social norms set by institutions and groups) and personal issues (e.g., autonomy, individual preferences related to friendships), and these can coexist depending on the context in which the exclusion occurs. In intergroup as well as intragroup contexts, children need to draw on knowledge and attitudes related to their own social identities, other social categories, the social norms associated with these categories as well as moral principals about the welfare of the excluded, and fair treatment, to make judgments about social exclusion. The importance of morality arises when the evaluation process of social exclusion requires one to deal with not only the predisposed tendencies of discrimination, prejudice, stereotypes and bias but also the internal judgments about justice equality and individual rights, which may prove to be a very complex task since it often evokes conflicts and dilemmas coming from the fact that the components of the first often challenge the components of the latter (Killen, Lee-Kim, McGlothlin, &amp; Stangor, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Killen|first=Melanie|last2=Lee-Kim|first2=Jennie|last3=McGlothlin|first3=Heidi|last4=Stangor|first4=Charles|last5=Helwig|first5=Charles C.|date=2002|title=How Children and Adolescents Evaluate Gender and Racial Exclusion|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=67|issue=4|pages=i–129|jstor=3181568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings from a Social Domain Theory perspective show that children are sensitive to the context of exclusion and pay attention to different variables when judging or evaluating exclusion. These variables include, social categories, the stereotypes associated with them, children's qualifications as defined by prior experience with an activity, personality and behavioral traits that might be disruptive for group functioning and conformity to conventions as defined by group identity or social consensus. In the absence of information, stereotypes can be used to justify exclusion of a member of an out-group (Horn 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Horn, S. S. (2003). Adolescents' reasoning about exclusion from social groups. ''Developmental Psychology'', 39, 71-84&lt;/ref&gt; Killen and Stangor, 2001&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Stangor, C. (2001). Children's social reasoning about inclusion and exclusion in gender and race peer group contexts. ''Child Development'', 72, 174-186&lt;/ref&gt;). One's personality traits and whether he or she conforms to socially accepted behaviors related to identity also provide further criteria for social acceptance and inclusion by peers (Killen, Crystal, &amp; Watanabe, 2002;&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Crystal, D. S., &amp; Watanabe, H. (2002). The individual and the group: Japanese and American children's evaluations of peer exclusion, tolerance of difference, and prescriptions for conformity. ''Child Development'', 73, 1788-1802&lt;/ref&gt; Park, Killen, Crystal, &amp; Watanabe, 2003&lt;ref&gt;Park, Y., Killen, M., Crystal, D., &amp; Watanabe, H. (2003). Korean, Japanese, and American children's evaluations of peer exclusion: Evidence for diversity. International Journal of Behavioral Development, 27, 555-565&lt;/ref&gt;). Also, research has documented the presence of a transition occurring at the reasoning level behind the criteria of inclusion and exclusion from childhood to adolescence (Horn, 2003). As children get older, they become more attuned to issues of group functioning and conventions and weigh them in congruence with issues of fairness and morality (Killen &amp; Stangor, 2001)

===Allocation of resources===

[[Resource allocation]] is a critical part of the [[decision making process]] for individuals in positions of public responsibility and authority (e.g., health care providers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calman|first1=K C|title=The ethics of allocation of scarce health care resources: a view from the centre|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=1 June 1994|volume=20|issue=2|pages=71–4|doi=10.1136/jme.20.2.71|pmid=8083876|pmc=1376429}}&lt;/ref&gt; When resources become scarce, such as in rural communities experiencing situations when there is not enough food to feed everyone, authorities in position to make decisions that affect this community can create conflicts on various levels (e.g., personally, financially, socially, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardent|first1=Paul B.,|last2=Reeves|first2=Susan A.,|title=Ethic Conflicts in Rural Communities|url=http://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/cfm/resources/ethics/chapter-09.pdf|publisher=Dartmouth College Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moral conflict that arise from these decisions can be divided into a focus of conflict and a locus of moral conflict. The locus, or the place where conflict occurs, can develop from multiple sources which include “any combination of personal, professional, organizational, and community values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardent|first1=Paul B.,|last2=Reeves|first2=Susan A.,|title=Ethic Conflicts in Rural Communities|url=http://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/cfm/resources/ethics/chapter-09.pdf|publisher=Dartmouth College Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of conflict occurs from competing values held by stakeholders and financial investors. As K. C. Calman (1994) stated in regards to the reallocation of resources in a medical setting, resources must be thought of not only as money, but also in the form of skills, time, and faculties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calman|first1=K C|title=The ethics of allocation of scarce health care resources: a view from the centre.|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=1 June 1994|volume=20|issue=2|pages=72–73|doi=10.1136/jme.20.2.71|pmc=1376429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The healthcare system has many examples where morality and resource allocation has ongoing conflicts. Concerns of morality arise when the initiation, continuation, and withdrawal of intensive care affects a patients well being due to medical decision making.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bone|first1=Roger C.|last2=Rackow|first2=Eric C.|last3=Weg|first3=John G.|last4=Butler|first4=Peter|last5=Carton|first5=Robert W.|last6=Elpern|first6=Ellen|last7=Franklin|first7=Cory|last8=Goldman|first8=Edward B.|last9=Gracey|first9=Douglas D.|last10=Hiss|first10=Roland G.|last11=Knaus|first11=William A.|last12=Lefrak|first12=Stephen S.|last13=McCartney|first13=Rev.

“How should I interpret new diagnostic information?
How do I select the appropriate diagnostic test? 
How do I choose among several risky treatments?” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Owens|first1=Harold C. Sox, Michael C. Higgins, Douglas K.|title=Medical decision making|date=2013|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|isbn=978-0-470-65866-6|pages=1–3|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, in the United States, has had a moral consensus that there are no differences between these two therapies. However, even though a political decision offers support for medical practitioner's decision making, there continues to be difficulty withdrawing life-sustaining treatments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Multiple gender attraction''' ('''MGA'''), sometimes '''multi-gender attraction''', is an [[umbrella term]] that includes any [[Romance (love)|romantic]] or [[sexual orientation]] which experiences attraction to more than one [[gender]]. Such orientations include, but are not limited to, [[bisexuality]], [[pansexuality]], and [[polysexuality]].

The '''National Institute for Space Research''' ({{lang-pt|Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais}}, '''INPE''') is a research unit of the [[Brazil]]ian [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (Brazil)|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]], whose main goals are fostering scientific research and technological applications and qualifying personnel in the fields of [[Outer space|space]] and [[atmospheric sciences]], [[Aerospace engineering|space engineering]], and [[space technology]]. While INPE is the civilian research center for aerospace activities, the [[Brazilian Air Force]]'s [[Brazilian Aerospace Technical Center (CTA)|General Command for Aerospace Technology]] is the military arm. INPE is located in the city of [[São José dos Campos]], São Paulo.

==History==
On August 3, 1961, [[President of Brazil|President]] [[Jânio Quadros]] signed a decree which created the Organizing Group for the National Commission on Space Activities (COGNAE). This group would give rise to the current National Institute for Space Research.

COGNAE, which shortly after became known as CNAE, started its activities by stimulating, coordinating and supporting studies on [[Outer space|space]] related areas, besides breeding a team of skilled [[researcher]]s and establishing cooperation with leading nations on the space area.

Initially, the research program was developed through its laboratories in [[São José dos Campos]] — still the main campus today. The studies included [[ionosphere]] sounding in the upper atmosphere through devices placed on the ground and mainly through scientific rocket payloads launched from the [[Barreira do Inferno Launch Center]], near [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]].

On April 22, 1971, the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) was created, subordinated to the [[Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico|National Research Council]] (CNPq). Its first Director was the electronic engineer [[Fernando de Mendonça]]. INPE would be the main civilian executive organ for space research development in accordance with the directives of the Brazilian Commission for Space Activities (COBAE), an advisory organ to the President.

Until the mid-seventies, the main projects carried out by INPE included the usage of [[Meteorology|meteorological]], [[Telecommunication|communication]]s and [[earth observation satellite]]s. This engendered other projects such as:

*MESA - reception and interpretation of [[Weather satellite|meteorological satellite]] images;
*SERE - use of satellite [[remote sensing]] technique and aircraft earth resources monitoring
*SACI - that improved the educational system through broadcasting, using a [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] [[communications satellite]].

INPE entered a new era when the Brazilian government approved the [[Brazilian space program|Complete Brazilian Space Mission]] (MECB) at the end of the 1970s. The institute, besides research and applications, started the development of the space technology for specific needs, essential for a country of continental dimensions with immense uninhabited areas.

On March 15, 1985, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MCT) was created and INPE became part of it as an independent organ of the Direct Administration.

During the 1980s, INPE started developing priority programs such as:
* [[Brazilian space program|Complete Brazilian Space Mission]] (MECB),
* [[China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program]] (CBERS),
* [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] Research Program (AMZ),
* Center for Weather Forecast and Climatic Studies (CPTEC).

It also kept track of other countries' research on the space area, facilitating collaboration and partnership with them. During this period it also established its Integration and Tests Laboratory (LIT) which develops highly specialized activities essential to the Brazilian Space Program.

In the 1990s, the first Brazilian satellite (SCD-1) was launched.

Since 1994, the [[Brazilian Space Agency]] has been responsible for Brazil's [[Space exploration|space program]]. INPE works in close cooperation with the agency.

In 1998, the second Brazilian satellite (SCD-2) was successfully launched, performing even better than the first one. CBERS 1 was launched in 1999, CBERS 2 in 2003 and CBERS 2B in 2007.

'''Pattern recognition''' is the automated recognition of patterns and regularities in [[data]]. Pattern recognition is closely related to [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]],&lt;ref name="Bishop2006"&gt;
{{cite book |first=Christopher M. |last=Bishop |year=2006 |title=Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning |publisher=Springer |quote=Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering, whereas machine learning grew out of computer science. However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field, and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years. |page=vii|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/998831/files/9780387310732_TOC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with applications such as [[data mining]] and [[knowledge discovery in databases]] (KDD), and is often used interchangeably with these terms. However, these are distinguished: machine learning is one approach to pattern recognition, while other approaches include hand-crafted (not learned) rules or [[heuristic]]s; and pattern recognition is one approach to artificial intelligence, while other approaches include [[symbolic artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald |last=Tveter |title =The Pattern Recognition Basis of Artificial Intelligence |year=1998 |url=http://www.dontveter.com/basisofai/basisofai.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern definition of pattern recognition is:
{{quote
|The field of pattern recognition is concerned with the automatic discovery of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with the use of these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bishop|2006|loc=p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This article focuses on machine learning approaches to pattern recognition. Pattern recognition systems are in many cases trained from labeled "training" data ([[supervised learning]]), but when no labeled data are available other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns ([[unsupervised learning]]). Machine learning is the common term for supervised learning methods{{dubious|date=November 2014}} and originates from [[artificial intelligence]], whereas KDD and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use. Pattern recognition has its origins in [[engineering]], and the term is popular in the context of [[computer vision]]: a leading computer vision conference is named [[Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition]]. In pattern recognition, there may be a higher interest to formalize, explain and visualize the pattern, while machine learning traditionally focuses on maximizing the recognition rates. Yet, all of these domains have evolved substantially from their roots in artificial intelligence, engineering and statistics, and they've become increasingly similar by integrating developments and ideas from each other.

In [[machine learning]], pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value. In statistics, [[Linear discriminant analysis|discriminant analysis]] was introduced for this same purpose in 1936. An example of pattern recognition is [[classification (machine learning)|classification]], which attempts to assign each input value to one of a given set of ''classes'' (for example, determine whether a given email is "spam" or "non-spam"). However, pattern recognition is a more general problem that encompasses other types of output as well. Other examples are [[regression analysis|regression]], which assigns a [[real number|real-valued]] output to each input;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=W.R.|date=2007-02-20|title=Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning20072Christopher M.

Pattern recognition algorithms generally aim to provide a reasonable answer for all possible inputs and to perform "most likely" matching of the inputs, taking into account their statistical variation. This is opposed to ''[[pattern matching]]'' algorithms, which look for exact matches in the input with pre-existing patterns. A common example of a pattern-matching algorithm is [[regular expression]] matching, which looks for patterns of a given sort in textual data and is included in the search capabilities of many [[text editor]]s and [[word processor]]s. In contrast to pattern recognition, pattern matching is not generally a type of machine learning, although pattern-matching algorithms (especially with fairly general, carefully tailored patterns) can sometimes succeed in providing similar-quality output of the sort provided by pattern-recognition algorithms.

==Overview==
Pattern recognition is generally categorized according to the type of learning procedure used to generate the output value. ''[[Supervised learning]]'' assumes that a set of ''training data'' (the ''[[training set]]'') has been provided, consisting of a set of instances that have been properly labeled by hand with the correct output. Training patterns are the goals of the training process and not to be confused with the training set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/training-pattern|title=What is a Training Pattern in Machine Learning?|last=|first=|date=|website=deepai.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A learning procedure then generates a ''model'' that attempts to meet two sometimes conflicting objectives: Perform as well as possible on the training data, and generalize as well as possible to new data (usually, this means being as simple as possible, for some technical definition of "simple", in accordance with [[Occam's Razor]], discussed below). [[Unsupervised learning]], on the other hand, assumes training data that has not been hand-labeled, and attempts to find inherent patterns in the data that can then be used to determine the correct output value for new data instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author= Carvalko, J.R., Preston K. | year=1972 |title= On Determining Optimum Simple Golay Marking Transforms for Binary Image Processing | journal= IEEE Transactions on Computers  | volume=21 | pages=1430–33  | doi = 10.1109/T-C.1972.223519}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of the two that has recently been explored is [[semi-supervised learning]], which uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data (typically a small set of labeled data combined with a large amount of unlabeled data). Note that in cases of unsupervised learning, there may be no training data at all to speak of; in other words,and the data to be labeled ''is'' the training data.

Note that sometimes different terms are used to describe the corresponding supervised and unsupervised learning procedures for the same type of output. For example, the unsupervised equivalent of classification is normally known as ''[[data clustering|clustering]]'', based on the common perception of the task as involving no training data to speak of, and of grouping the input data into ''clusters'' based on some inherent [[similarity measure]] (e.g. the [[distance]] between instances, considered as vectors in a multi-dimensional [[vector space]]), rather than assigning each input instance into one of a set of pre-defined classes. Note also that in some fields, the terminology is different: For example, in [[community ecology]], the term "classification" is used to refer to what is commonly known as "clustering".

The piece of input data for which an output value is generated is formally termed an ''instance''. The instance is formally described by a [[feature vector|vector]] of ''features'', which together constitute a description of all known characteristics of the instance. (These feature vectors can be seen as defining points in an appropriate [[space (mathematics)|multidimensional space]], and methods for manipulating vectors in [[vector space]]s can be correspondingly applied to them, such as computing the [[dot product]] or the angle between two vectors.) Typically, features are either [[categorical data|categorical]] (also known as [[nominal data|nominal]], i.e., consisting of one of a set of unordered items, such as a gender of "male" or "female", or a blood type of "A", "B", "AB" or "O"), [[ordinal data|ordinal]] (consisting of one of a set of ordered items, e.g., "large", "medium" or "small"), [[integer|integer-valued]] (e.g., a count of the number of occurrences of a particular word in an email) or [[real number|real-valued]] (e.g., a measurement of blood pressure). Often, categorical and ordinal data are grouped together; likewise for integer-valued and real-valued data. Furthermore, many algorithms work only in terms of categorical data and require that real-valued or integer-valued data be ''discretized'' into groups (e.g., less than 5, between 5 and 10, or greater than 10).

===Probabilistic classifiers===
{{main article|Probabilistic classifier}}
Many common pattern recognition algorithms are ''probabilistic'' in nature, in that they use [[statistical inference]] to find the best label for a given instance. Unlike other algorithms, which simply output a "best" label, often probabilistic algorithms also output a [[probability]] of the instance being described by the given label. In addition, many probabilistic algorithms output a list of the ''N''-best labels with associated probabilities, for some value of ''N'', instead of simply a single best label. When the number of possible labels is fairly small (e.g., in the case of [[classification (machine learning)|classification]]), ''N'' may be set so that the probability of all possible labels is output. Probabilistic algorithms have many advantages over non-probabilistic algorithms:
*They output a confidence value associated with their choice. (Note that some other algorithms may also output confidence values, but in general, only for probabilistic algorithms is this value mathematically grounded in [[probability theory]]. Non-probabilistic confidence values can in general not be given any specific meaning, and only used to compare against other confidence values output by the same algorithm.)
*Correspondingly, they can ''abstain'' when the confidence of choosing any particular output is too low.
*Because of the probabilities output, probabilistic pattern-recognition algorithms can be more effectively incorporated into larger machine-learning tasks, in a way that partially or completely avoids the problem of ''error propagation''.

===Number of important feature variables===
[[Feature selection]] algorithms attempt to directly prune out redundant or irrelevant features. A general introduction to [[feature selection]] which summarizes approaches and challenges, has been given.&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Guyon Clopinet, André Elisseeff (2003). ''An Introduction to Variable and Feature Selection''. The Journal of Machine Learning Research, Vol. 3, 1157-1182. [http://www-vis.lbl.gov/~romano/mlgroup/papers/guyon03a.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of feature-selection is, because of its non-monotonous character, an [[optimization problem]] where given a total of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; features the [[powerset]] consisting of all &lt;math&gt;2^n-1&lt;/math&gt; subsets of features need to be explored. The [[Branch and bound|Branch-and-Bound algorithm]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; does reduce this complexity but is intractable for medium to large values of the number of available features &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. For a large-scale comparison of feature-selection algorithms see 
.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal|author1=Mineichi Kudo |author2=Jack Sklansky | year=2000 |

Techniques to transform the raw feature vectors ('''feature extraction''') are sometimes used prior to application of the pattern-matching algorithm. For example, [[feature extraction]] algorithms attempt to reduce a large-dimensionality feature vector into a smaller-dimensionality vector that is easier to work with and encodes less redundancy, using mathematical techniques such as [[principal components analysis]] (PCA). The distinction between '''feature selection''' and '''feature extraction''' is that the resulting features after feature extraction has taken place are of a different sort than the original features and may not easily be interpretable, while the features left after feature selection are simply a subset of the original features.

== Problem statement (supervised version)==
Formally, the problem of [[supervised learning|supervised]] pattern recognition can be stated as follows: Given an unknown function &lt;math&gt;g:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; (the ''ground truth'') that maps input instances &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; to output labels &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt;, along with training data &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} = \{(\boldsymbol{x}_1,y_1),\dots,(\boldsymbol{x}_n, y_n)\}&lt;/math&gt; assumed to represent accurate examples of the mapping, produce a function &lt;math&gt;h:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; that approximates as closely as possible the correct mapping &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. (For example, if the problem is filtering spam, then &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x}_i&lt;/math&gt; is some representation of an email and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is either "spam" or "non-spam"). In order for this to be a well-defined problem, "approximates as closely as possible" needs to be defined rigorously. In [[decision theory]], this is defined by specifying a [[loss function]] or cost function that assigns a specific value to "loss" resulting from producing an incorrect label. The goal then is to minimize the [[expected value|expected]] loss, with the expectation taken over the [[probability distribution]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. In practice, neither the distribution of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; nor the ground truth function &lt;math&gt;g:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; are known exactly, but can be computed only empirically by collecting a large number of samples of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; and hand-labeling them using the correct value of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; (a time-consuming process, which is typically the limiting factor in the amount of data of this sort that can be collected). The particular loss function depends on the type of label being predicted. For example, in the case of [[classification (machine learning)|classification]], the simple [[zero-one loss function]] is often sufficient. This corresponds simply to assigning a loss of 1 to any incorrect labeling and implies that the optimal classifier minimizes the [[Bayes error rate|error rate]] on independent test data (i.e. counting up the fraction of instances that the learned function &lt;math&gt;h:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; labels wrongly, which is equivalent to maximizing the number of correctly classified instances). The goal of the learning procedure is then to minimize the error rate (maximize the [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]]) on a "typical" test set.

For a probabilistic pattern recognizer, the problem is instead to estimate the probability of each possible output label given a particular input instance, i.e., to estimate a function of the form
:&lt;math&gt;p({\rm label}|\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol\theta) = f\left(\boldsymbol{x};\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where the [[feature vector]] input is &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x}&lt;/math&gt;, and the function ''f'' is typically parameterized by some parameters &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;For [[linear discriminant analysis]] the parameter vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta&lt;/math&gt; consists of the two mean vectors &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\mu_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\mu_2&lt;/math&gt; and the common [[covariance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[discriminative model|discriminative]] approach to the problem, ''f'' is estimated directly. In a [[generative model|generative]] approach, however, the inverse probability &lt;math&gt;p({\boldsymbol{x}|\rm label})&lt;/math&gt; is instead estimated and combined with the [[prior probability]] &lt;math&gt;p({\rm label}|\boldsymbol\theta)&lt;/math&gt; using [[Bayes' rule]], as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;p({\rm label}|\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol\theta) = \frac{p({\boldsymbol{x}|\rm label,\boldsymbol\theta}) p({\rm label|\boldsymbol\theta})}{\sum_{L \in \text{all labels}} p(\boldsymbol{x}|L) p(L|\boldsymbol\theta)}.&lt;/math&gt;

When the labels are [[continuous distribution|continuously distributed]] (e.g., in [[regression analysis]]), the denominator involves [[integral|integration]] rather than summation:

:&lt;math&gt;p({\rm label}|\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol\theta) = \frac{p({\boldsymbol{x}|\rm label,\boldsymbol\theta}) p({\rm label|\boldsymbol\theta})}{\int_{L \in \text{all labels}} p(\boldsymbol{x}|L) p(L|\boldsymbol\theta) \operatorname{d}L}.&lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta&lt;/math&gt; is typically learned using [[maximum a posteriori]] (MAP) estimation. This finds the best value that simultaneously meets two conflicting objects: To perform as well as possible on the training data (smallest [[Bayes error rate|error-rate]]) and to find the simplest possible model. Essentially, this combines [[maximum likelihood]] estimation with a [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] procedure that favors simpler models over more complex models. In a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] context, the regularization procedure can be viewed as placing a [[prior probability]] &lt;math&gt;p(\boldsymbol\theta)&lt;/math&gt; on different values of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta&lt;/math&gt;. Mathematically:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta^* = \arg \max_{\boldsymbol\theta} p(\boldsymbol\theta|\mathbf{D})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta^*&lt;/math&gt; is the value used for &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta&lt;/math&gt; in the subsequent evaluation procedure, and &lt;math&gt;p(\boldsymbol\theta|\mathbf{D})&lt;/math&gt;, the [[posterior probability]] of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;p(\boldsymbol\theta|\mathbf{D}) = \left[\prod_{i=1}^n p(y_i|\boldsymbol{x}_i,\boldsymbol\theta) \right] p(\boldsymbol\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]] approach to this problem, instead of choosing a single parameter vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\theta}^*&lt;/math&gt;, the probability of a given label for a new instance &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x}&lt;/math&gt; is computed by integrating over all possible values of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta&lt;/math&gt;, weighted according to the posterior probability:

:&lt;math&gt;p({\rm label}|\boldsymbol{x}) = \int p({\rm label}|\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol\theta)p(\boldsymbol{\theta}|\mathbf{D}) \operatorname{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Frequentist or Bayesian approach to pattern recognition ===
The first pattern classifier – the linear discriminant presented by [[Fisher discriminant analysis|Fisher]] – was developed in the [[Frequentist inference|frequentist]] tradition. The frequentist approach entails that the model parameters are considered unknown, but objective. The parameters are then computed (estimated) from the collected data. For the linear discriminant, these parameters are precisely the mean vectors and the [[covariance matrix]]. Also the probability of each class &lt;math&gt;p({\rm label}|\boldsymbol\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is estimated from the collected dataset. Note that the usage of '[[Bayes rule]]' in a pattern classifier does not make the classification approach Bayesian.

[[Bayesian inference|Bayesian statistics]] has its origin in Greek philosophy where a distinction was already made between the '[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]' and the '[[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]' knowledge. Later [[A priori and a posteriori#Immanuel Kant|Kant]] defined his distinction between what is a priori known – before observation – and the empirical knowledge gained from observations. In a Bayesian pattern classifier, the class probabilities &lt;math&gt;p({\rm label}|\boldsymbol\theta)&lt;/math&gt; can be chosen by the user, which are then a priori. Moreover, experience quantified as a priori parameter values can be weighted with empirical observations – using e.g., the [[Beta distribution|Beta-]] ([[Conjugate prior distribution|conjugate prior]]) and [[Dirichlet distribution|Dirichlet-distributions]]. The Bayesian approach facilitates a seamless intermixing between expert knowledge in the form of subjective probabilities, and objective observations.

Probabilistic pattern classifiers can be used according to a frequentist or a Bayesian approach..

Within medical science, pattern recognition is the basis for [[computer-aided diagnosis]] (CAD) systems. CAD describes a procedure that supports the doctor's interpretations and findings.
Other typical applications of pattern recognition techniques are automatic [[speech recognition]], [[document classification|classification of text into several categories]] (e.g., spam/non-spam email messages), the [[handwriting recognition|automatic recognition of handwritten postal codes]] on postal envelopes, automatic [[image recognition|recognition of images]] of human faces, or handwriting image extraction from medical forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milewski|first=Robert|author2=Govindaraju, Venu|title=Binarization and cleanup of handwritten text from carbon copy medical form images|journal=Pattern Recognition|date=31 March 2008|volume=41|issue=4|pages=1308–1315|doi=10.1016/j.patcog.2007.08.018|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1324656}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last two examples form the subtopic [[image analysis]] of pattern recognition that deals with digital images as input to pattern recognition systems.&lt;ref name=duda2001&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard O.

[[Artificial neural networks]] (neural net classifiers) and [[deep learning]] have many real-world applications in image processing, a few examples:
* identification and authentication: e.g., [[license plate recognition]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://anpr-tutorial.com/ THE AUTOMATIC NUMBER PLATE RECOGNITION TUTORIAL] http://anpr-tutorial.com/&lt;/ref&gt; fingerprint analysis, [[face detection]]/verification;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/usr/mitchell/ftp/faces.html Neural Networks for Face Recognition] Companion to Chapter 4 of the textbook Machine Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;, and voice-based authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poddar|first=Arnab|author2=Sahidullah, Md |author3=Saha, Goutam|title=Speaker Verification with Short Utterances: A Review of Challenges, Trends and Opportunities|journal=IET Biometrics|date=March 2018|volume=7|issue=2|pages=91–101|doi= 10.1049/iet-bmt.2017.0065|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8302747/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a discussion of the aforementioned applications of neural networks in image processing, see e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Egmont-Petersen, M., de Ridder, D., Handels, H. | year=2002 |

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychology, [[pattern recognition (psychology)|pattern recognition]] (making sense of and identifying objects) is closely related to perception, which explains how the sensory inputs humans receive are made meaningful. Pattern recognition can be thought of in two different ways: the first being template matching and the second being feature detection. 
A template is a pattern used to produce items of the same proportions. The template-matching hypothesis suggests that incoming stimuli are compared with templates in the long term memory. If there is a match, the stimulus is identified.
Feature detection models, such as the Pandemonium system for classifying letters (Selfridge, 1959), suggest that the stimuli are broken down into their component parts for identification. For example, a capital E has three horizontal lines and one vertical line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s-cool.co.uk/a-level/psychology/attention/revise-it/pattern-recognition |title=A-level Psychology Attention Revision - Pattern recognition &amp;#124; S-cool, the revision website |publisher=S-cool.co.uk |accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithms==
Algorithms for pattern recognition depend on the type of label output, on whether learning is supervised or unsupervised, and on whether the algorithm is statistical or non-statistical in nature. Statistical algorithms can further be categorized as [[generative model|generative]] or [[discriminative model|discriminative]].

'''Regulome''' refers to the whole set of regulatory components in a [[cell (biology)|cell]]. Those components can be regulatory elements, [[gene]]s, [[mRNA]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[metabolite]]s. The description includes the interplay of regulatory effects between these components, and their dependence on variables such as [[subcellular localization]], [[Biological tissue|tissue]], developmental stage, and pathological state.

== Components ==

One of the major players in cellular regulation are [[transcription factor]]s, proteins that regulate the expression of genes. Other proteins that bind to transcription factors to form [[Transcription preinitiation complex|transcriptional complexes]] might modify the activity of transcription factors, for example blocking their capacity to bind to a [[promotor (biology)|promoter]].

[[Signaling pathway]]s are groups of proteins that produce an effect in a chain that transmit a signal from one part of the cell to another part, for example, linking the presence of substance at the exterior of the cell to the activation of the expression of a gene.

== Measuring ==

High-throughput technologies for the analysis of biological samples (for example, [[DNA microarray]]s, [[proteomics]] analysis) allow the measurement of thousands of biological components such as mRNAs, proteins, or metabolites. [[Chromatin immunoprecipitation]] of transcription factors can be used to map transcription factor binding sites in the genome.

Such techniques allow researchers to study the effects of particular substances and/or situations on a cellular sample at a genomic level (for example, by addition of a drug, or by placing cells in a situation of stress). The information obtained allows parts of the regulome to be inferred.

== Modeling ==

One of the objectives of [[systems biology]] is the modelization of biological processes using [[mathematics]] and [[computer simulation]]. The production of data from techniques of genomic analysis is not always amenable to interpretation mainly due to the complexity of the data and the large amount of data points. Modelization can handle the data and allow to test a hypothesis (for example, gene A is regulated by protein B) that can be verified experimentally.

== Applications ==

The complete knowledge of the regulome will allow researchers to model cell behaviour entirely. This will facilitate the [[drug design|design of drugs]] for therapy, the control of [[stem cell]] differentiation, and the prognosis of [[disease]].

'''Richard Bentley''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|n|t|l|i}}; 27 January 1662 – 14 July 1742) was an English [[Classics|classical scholar]], critic, and theologian. He was Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].

Bentley was the first Englishman to be ranked with the great heroes of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] learning and was known for his literary and textual criticism. Called the "founder of historical [[philology]]", Bentley is credited with the creation of the English school of [[Hellenism (Academia)|Hellenism]], and introduced the first competitive written examinations in a Western university.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Richard Bentley blue plaque Bentley Square Oulton.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque on Bentley Square, Oulton]]
Bentley was born at [[Oulton, West Yorkshire|Oulton]] near [[Rothwell, West Yorkshire|Rothwell]], [[Leeds]], West Yorkshire, in northern England.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}} A blue plaque near his birthplace commemorates the fact. His father was Thomas Bentley of Oulton. His grandfather, Captain James Bentley,{{citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=for both his father and Grandfather's names}} had suffered for the [[Charles I of England|Royalist]] cause following the [[English Civil War]], leaving the family in reduced circumstances. Bentley's mother, the daughter of a [[stonemason]], had some education, and was able to give her son his first lessons in [[Latin language|Latin]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

After attending [[grammar school]] in [[Wakefield]], Bentley was an undergraduate at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], in 1676.{{efn|His portrait hangs in the formal dining hall of the College.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}}} He afterwards obtained a scholarship and took the degree of B.A. in 1680 (M.A. 1683).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}{{sfn|ACAD|BNTY676R}}

==Academic work==
He never became a [[Fellow]], but was appointed to be the headmaster of [[Spalding Grammar School]] before he was 21. [[Edward Stillingfleet]], dean of St Paul's, hired Bentley as tutor to his son, which enabled the younger man to meet eminent scholars, have access to the best private library in England, and become familiar with Dean Stillingfleet. During his six years as tutor, Bentley also made a comprehensive study of [[Greek language|Greek]] and Latin writers, storing up knowledge which he used later.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

In 1689, Stillingfleet became [[bishop of Worcester]], and Bentley's pupil went to [[Wadham College, Oxford]], accompanied by his tutor. Bentley soon met [[John Mill (theologian)|Dr John Mill]], [[Humphrey Hody]], and [[Edward Bernard]]. Here he studied the manuscripts of the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]], [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi]] and other college libraries. He collected material for literary studies. Among these are a corpus of the fragments of the Greek poets and an edition of the Greek [[lexicographer]]s.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

The Oxford (Sheldonian) press was about to bring out an edition (the ''[[editio princeps]]'') from the unique manuscript of the ''[[Greek Chronicle]]'' in the [[Bodleian Library]]. It was a [[universal history]] (down to AD 560) of John of Antioch (date uncertain, between 600 and 1000), called [[John Malalas]] or "John the Rhetor". The editor, Dr John Mill, principal of [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]], asked Bentley to review it and make any remarks on the text.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

Bentley wrote the ''Epistola ad Johannem Millium'', which is about 100 pages included at the end of the ''Oxford Malalas'' (1691). This short treatise placed Bentley ahead of all living English scholars. The ease with which he restored corrupted passages, the certainty of his [[:wikt:emendation|emendation]] and command over the relevant material, are in a style totally different from the careful and laborious learning of [[Humphrey Hody|Hody]], Mill or [[Edmund Chilmead]]. To the small circle of classical students (lacking the great critical dictionaries of modern times), it was obvious that he was a critic beyond the ordinary.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

[[Image:Bust of Richard Bently by Louis-François Roubiliac.jpg|thumb|upright|A bust of Bentley now stands in the library of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]
In 1690, Bentley had taken [[deacon]]'s orders. In 1692 he was nominated first [[Boyle Lectures|Boyle lecturer]], a nomination repeated in 1694. He was offered the appointment a third time in 1695 but declined it, as he was involved in too many other activities. In the first series of lectures ("A Confutation of Atheism"), he endeavours to present [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] [[physics]] in a popular form, and to frame them (especially in opposition to [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]) into proof of the existence of an intelligent Creator. He had some correspondence with Newton, then living in [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], on the subject. The second series, preached in 1694, has not been published and is believed to be lost.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

After being [[ordain]]ed, Bentley was promoted to a [[prebendal stall]] in [[Worcester Cathedral]]. In 1693 the curator of the royal library became vacant, and his friends tried to obtain the position for Bentley, but did not have enough influence. The new librarian, a Mr Thynne, resigned in favour of Bentley, on condition that he receive an annuity of £130 for life out of the £200 salary. In 1695 Bentley received a royal [[chaplaincy]] and the [[Benefice|living]] of [[Hartlebury]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

That same year, he was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society]], and in 1696 earned the degree of D.D. (Doctor of Divinity). The scholar [[Johann Georg Graevius]] of [[Utrecht]] made a dedication to him, prefixed to a dissertation on [[Albert Rubens (1614-1657)|Albert Rubens]], ''De Vita Fl. Mallii Theodori'' (1694).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

===Dissertation on the ''Epistles'' of Phalaris===
Bentley had official apartments in [[St. James's Palace]], and his first care was the royal library. He worked to restore the collection from a dilapidated condition. He persuaded the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]] to ask for additional rooms in the palace for the books. This was granted, but Marlborough kept them for personal use. Bentley enforced the law, ensuring that publishers delivered nearly 1000 volumes which had been purchased but not delivered.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

The [[University of Cambridge]] commissioned him to obtain Greek and Latin fonts for their classical books; he had these made in Holland. He assisted [[John Evelyn]] in his ''Numismata''. Bentley did not settle down to the steady execution of any of the major projects he had started. In 1694, he designed an edition of [[Philostratus]], but abandoned it to Gottfried Olearius (1672–1715), "to the joy," says [[Friedrich August Wolf|F. A. Wolf]], "of Olearius and of no one else." He supplied [[Graevius]] with collations of [[Cicero]], and [[Joshua Barnes]] with a warning as to the spuriousness of the ''Epistles'' of [[Euripides]]. Barnes printed the epistles anyway and declared that no one could doubt their authenticity but a man ''perfrictae frontis aut judicii imminuti''. For Graevius's ''Callimachus'' (1697), Bentley added a collection of the fragments with notes.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

He wrote the ''Dissertation on the Epistles of Phalaris'' (1699), his major academic work, almost accidentally. In 1697, [[William Wotton]], about to bring out a second edition of his ''Ancient and Modern Learning'', asked Bentley to write out a paper exposing the spuriousness of the ''Epistles'' of [[Phalaris]], long a subject of academic controversy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} The [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] editor of Phalaris, [[Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery|Charles Boyle]], resented Bentley's paper. He had already quarrelled with Bentley in trying to get the manuscript in the royal library collated for his edition (1695). Boyle wrote a response which was accepted by the reading public, although it was much later criticised as showing superficial learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} cites Dr [[Alexander Dyce]], ''Bentley's Works, 1836–1838''&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for Boyle's book required a second printing. When Bentley responded, it was with his dissertation. The truth of its conclusions was not immediately recognised, but it has a high reputation.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

===Master of Trinity College===
In 1700, the commissioners of ecclesiastical [[patronage]] recommended Bentley to the Crown for the mastership of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He arrived an outsider and proceeded to reform the college administration.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} He started a programme of renovations to the buildings, and used his position to promote learning. He is also credited by the British mathematician [[Rouse Ball]]{{sfn|Ball|1835|p=193}}  with starting the first written examinations in the West in 1702, all those prior to this being oral in nature.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} At the same time, he antagonised the fellows, and the capital programme caused reductions in their incomes, which they resented.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

After ten years of stubborn but ineffectual resistance, the fellows appealed to the Visitor, the [[bishop of Ely]] ([[John Moore (Bishop of Ely)|John Moore]]). Their petition was full of general complaints. Bentley's reply (''The Present State of Trinity College'', etc., 1710) is in his most crushing style. The fellows amended their petition and added a charge of Bentley's having committed 54 breaches of the statutes. Bentley appealed directly to the Crown, and backed his application with a dedication of his ''[[Horace]]'' to the lord treasurer (Harley).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

The Crown lawyers decided against him; the case was heard (1714) and a sentence of expulsion from the mastership was drawn up. Before it was executed, the bishop of Ely died and the process lapsed. The feud continued in various forms at lower levels. In 1718 Cambridge rescinded Bentley's degrees, as punishment for failing to appear in the vice-chancellor's court in a civil suit. It was not until 1724 that he had them restored under the law.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

In 1733 the fellows of Trinity again brought Bentley to trial before the bishop of Ely (then [[Thomas Green (bishop)|Thomas Greene]]), and he was sentenced to deprivation. The college statutes required the sentence to be exercised by the vice-master [[Richard Walker (philosopher)|Richard Walker]], who was a friend of Bentley and refused to act. Although the feud continued until 1738 or 1740 (about thirty years in all), Bentley remained in his post.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

===Later studies===
During his mastership, except for the first two years, Bentley continuously pursued his studies, although he did not publish much. In 1709 he contributed a critical appendix to [[John Davies (1679–1732)|John Davies]]'s edition of [[Cicero]]'s ''Tusculan Disputations''. In the following year, he published his emendations on the ''Plutus'' and ''Nubes'' of [[Aristophanes]], and on the fragments of [[Menander]] and [[Philemon (poet)|Philemon]]. He published the last work under the pen name of "Phileleutherus Lipsiensis."  He used it again two years later in his ''Remarks on a late Discourse of Freethinking'', a reply to [[Anthony Collins]] the [[deism|deist]]. The university thanked him for this work and its support of the Anglican Church and clergy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

Although he had long studied Horace, Bentley wrote his version quickly in the end, publishing it in 1711 to gain public support at a critical period of the Trinity quarrel. In the preface, he declared his intention of confining his attention to criticism and correction of the text. Some of his 700 or 800 [[:wikt:emendations|emendations]] have been accepted, but the majority were rejected by the early 20th century as unnecessary, although scholars acknowledged they showed his wide learning.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

In 1716, in a letter to [[William Wake]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Bentley announced his plan to prepare a critical edition of the [[New Testament]]. During the next four years, assisted by [[J. J. Wetstein]], an eminent biblical critic, he collected materials for the work. In 1720 he published ''Proposals for a New Edition of the Greek Testament'', with examples of how he intended to proceed. By comparing the text of the [[Vulgate]] with that of the oldest Greek manuscripts, Bentley proposed to restore the Greek text as received by the church at the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]].&lt;!--EB1911 p. 752; states Nice not Nicaea--&gt;{{sfn|Dyce|1966|p=487}} Bentley's lead manuscript was ''[[Codex Alexandrinus]]'', which he described as "the oldest and best in the world".{{sfn|Jebb|1882|p=163}} Bentley used also manuscripts: [[Minuscule 51|51]], [[Minuscule 54|54]], [[Minuscule 60|60]], [[Minuscule 113|113]], [[Minuscule 440|440]], [[Minuscule 507|507]], and [[Minuscule 508|508]].{{sfn|Scrivener|1894|p=198}} [[John Walker (scholar)|John Walker]] worked over many manuscripts for the project, particularly in Paris with the help of the [[Congregation of Saint Maur|Maur]]ists.{{sfn|Wordsworth|1901|p=}} Numerous subscribers were obtained to support publication of the work, but he never completed it.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

His ''[[Terence]]'' (1726) is more important than his ''Horace''; next to the ''Phalaris'', this most determined his reputation. In 1726 he also published the ''Fables'' of [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]] and the ''Sententiae'' of [[Publilius Syrus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

His ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1732), suggested by [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]], has been criticised as the weakest of his work. He suggested that the poet [[John Milton]] had employed both an [[amanuensis]] and an editor, who were responsible for clerical errors and interpolations, but it is unclear whether Bentley believed his own position.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} [[A. E. Housman]], who called him "the greatest scholar that England or perhaps that Europe ever bred" nevertheless criticised his poetic sensibility severely: "...we are not all so easily found out as Bentley, because we have not Bentley's intrepid candour. There is a sort of savage nobility about his firm reliance on his own bad taste...".{{sfn|Housman|1989|p=268}}

Bentley never published his planned edition of [[Homer]], but some of his manuscript and marginal notes are held by Trinity College. Their chief importance is in his attempt to restore the metre by the insertion of the lost ''[[digamma]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

==Relationships and personal life==
According to the anonymous author of his biography in the [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] Bentley was self-assertive and presumptuous, which alienated some people. But, [[James Henry Monk]], Bentley's biographer, charged him (in his first edition, 1830) with an indecorum of which he was not guilty. Bentley seemed to inspire mixed feelings of admiration and repugnance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

==Marriage and family==
In 1701, Bentley married Joanna (died 1740), daughter of [[Sir John Bernard, 2nd Baronet]] of Brampton, [[Huntingdonshire]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}{{sfn|Collins|1741|p=364}}  They had three children together:
*[[Richard Bentley (writer)|Richard]] (1708–1782), an eccentric, playwright and artist,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}{{sfn|''SoPSE''}}{{sfn|Radcliffe|2011}}, and two daughters, one named Johanna.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} {{efn|A portrait, by [[William Wissing]] of his wife Joanna, is in the collection of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] {{harv|ArtUK}}.}}

His daughter{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} Johanna Bentley{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} married [[Denison Cumberland]] in 1728, a grandson of [[Richard Cumberland (bishop)|Richard Cumberland]] the [[bishop of Peterborough]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} and himself later a bishop of the [[Church of Ireland]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}Their son [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]] developed as a prolific dramatist,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} while earning his living as a civil servant.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Later life==
In old age, Bentley continued to read; and enjoyed the society of his friends and several rising scholars, J Markland, John Taylor, and his nephews Richard and Thomas Bentley, with whom he discussed classical subjects. He died on the 14 July 1742 of [[pleurisy]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

==Legacy and honours==
*Bentley left about £5,000 in his estate (which would have the buying power of nearly £500,000 in 2010{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}
*He bequeathed a few Greek manuscripts, brought from [[Mount Athos]], to the Trinity College library.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}
*He bequeathed his books and papers to his nephew Richard Bentley, a fellow of Trinity. At his own death in 1786, the younger Bentley left the papers to the Trinity College library.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}
*The [[British Museum]] eventually purchased the books, which in many cases had valuable manuscript notes, and holds them in its collection.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

According to the anonymous author of his biography in the Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition Bentley was the first Englishman to be ranked with the great heroes of classical learning. Before him there were only [[John Selden]], and, in a more restricted field, [[Thomas Gataker]] and [[John Pearson (bishop)|John Pearson]].
{{quote|Bentley inaugurated a new era of the art of criticism. He opened a new path. With him criticism attained its majority. Where scholars had hitherto offered suggestions and conjectures, Bentley, with unlimited control over the whole material of learning, gave decisions|Jacob Mähly (1828–1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} cites {{harv| Mähly|1868}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The modern German school of [[philology]] recognised his genius. Bunsen wrote that Bentley "was the founder of historical philology." [[Jakob Bernays]] says of his corrections of the ''Tristia'', "corruptions which had hitherto defied every attempt even of the mightiest, were removed by a touch of the fingers of this British [[Samson]]".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

Bentley was credited with creating the English school of Hellenists, by which the 18th century was distinguished, including scholars such as [[Richard Dawes|R Dawes]], [[Jeremiah Markland|J Markland]], [[John Taylor (1704–1766)|John Taylor]], [[Jonathan Toup]], [[Thomas Tyrwhitt|T Tyrwhitt]], [[Richard Porson]], [[Peter Paul Dobree]], [[Thomas Kidd (classical scholar)|Thomas Kidd]] and [[James Henry Monk]]. Although the Dutch school of the period had its own tradition, it was also influenced by Bentley. His letters to [[Tiberius Hemsterhuis]] on his edition of [[Julius Pollux]] made the latter one of Bentley's most devoted admirers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

Bentley inspired a following generation of scholars. Self-taught, he created his own discipline; but no contemporary English guild of learning could measure his power or check his eccentricities. He defeated his academic adversaries in the Phalaris controversy. The attacks by [[Alexander Pope]] (he was assigned a niche in ''The Dunciad''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} cite  Pope ''Dunciad'', b. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Arbuthnot]] and others demonstrated their inability to appreciate his work, as they considered textual criticism as pedantry.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} His classical controversies also called forth [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Battle of the Books]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In a university where the instruction of youth or the religious controversy of the day was the chief occupation, Bentley was unique. His learning and original views seem to have been developed before 1700. After this period, he acquired little and made only spasmodic efforts to publish.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} However A.E.Housman believed that the edition of [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]] (1739) was Bentley's greatest work.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5683">Roger de Piles's '''''L'Abrégé de la vie des peintres...avec un traité du peintre parfait''''' (''The Art of Painting and the Lives of the Painters''), was a major art biography of painters. It was written by the French spy [[Roger de Piles]]. In 1692, during the [[War of the League of Augsburg]], he was arrested in the Hague carrying a false passport and imprisoned for the next five years, where he wote his ''L'Abrégé'' in 7 parts; 1) Sketch of the perfect painter, 2) Greek painters; 3) Painters from Rome &amp; Florence; 4) Painters from Venice; 5) Painters from Lombardy; 6) Painters from Germany and the Low Countries; 7) Painters from France and ending with his famous "Balance of painters". The book was finally published in 1699 following his appointment as Conseiller Honoraire to the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]] in Paris.

Part 6 includes in order of appearance in the text, the following list of '''Artists from Germany and the Low Countries''':
*[[Hubert van Eyck]] (1366–1426), p 334
*[[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528), p 336
*[[Georg Pencz]] (1500–1550), p 342
*[[Peter Candid]] (1548–1628), p 343
*[[Cornelis Engebrechtsz.]] (1468–1533), p 343
*[[Bernard van Orley]] (1490–1541), p 344
*[[Michiel Coxie]] (1499–1592), p 345

The '''Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science''' ('''RSMAS''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|z|.|m|ə|s}}) is a academic and research institution for the study of [[oceanography]] and the [[atmospheric sciences]] within the [[University of Miami]] (UM). It is located on a 16 [[acre]] (65,000 m²) campus on [[Virginia Key]] in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]]. It is the only subtropical applied and basic marine and atmospheric research institute in the continental United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underwatertimes.com/ref/ref.php|title=The Reference Desk|accessdate=February 18, 2010|publisher=UnderwaterTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marinesciencetoday.com/2009/07/17/university-roundup-rosentstiel-school-of-marine-and-atmospheric-science-at-the-university-of-miami/|publisher=Marine Science Today|title=University Roundup: Rosentstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami|accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until 2008, RSMAS was solely a [[graduate school]] within the University of Miami, while it jointly administrated an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate program]] with UM's College of Arts and Sciences. In 2008, the Rosenstiel School has taken over administrative responsibilities for the undergraduate program, granting Bachelor of Science in Marine and Atmospheric Science (BSMAS) and Bachelor of Arts in Marine Affairs (BAMA) [[baccalaureate degree]]. [[master's degree|Master's]], including a Master of [[First professional degree|Professional]] Science degree, and  [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorates]] are also awarded to RSMAS students by the UM Graduate School.&lt;ref name=mps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mps.rsmas.miami.edu/|title=Master of Professional Science - Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Science - University of Miami|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.edu/gs/index.php/graduate_school/about_us/message_from_the_dean/|title=Message from the Dean {{!}} Graduate School {{!}} University of Miami|publisher=University of Miami|accessdate=2011-02-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720000147/http://www.miami.edu/gs/index.php/graduate_school/about_us/message_from_the_dean/|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rosenstiel School's research includes the [[marine biology|study of marine life]], particularly ''[[Aplysia]]'' and [[coral]]; [[climate change]]; air-sea interactions; [[coastal ecology]]; and [[admiralty law]]. The school operates a marine research laboratory ship, and has a research site at an inland [[sinkhole]]. Research also includes the use of data from weather satellites and the school operates its own satellite downlink facility.

==History==
[[Image:Rosenstiel Entrance Plate.jpg|thumb|left|The sign near the entrance to RSMAS.]]

In 1940, University of Miami President Bowman Ashe recruited [[F.G. Walton Smith]], a young British marine biologist who was working in the Bahamas. Smith joined the Department of Zoology, and began organizing the development of a marine laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/about-rsmas/history/|title=The History of the Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Science|publisher=University of Miami|accessdate=April 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525183106/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/about-rsmas/history/|archive-date=2011-05-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, the Board of Trustees of the University of Miami established the Marine Laboratory for the University.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; They invited researchers and oceanographers to associate themselves with this laboratory. Its three original objectives were teaching, basic research, and applied marine research. The laboratory focused on subjects specific to the tropical environment. Initially, the Marine Lab was located in a private boathouse on an estate on Belle Isle in [[Miami Beach, Florida]]. In 1945, when the boathouse became structurally unsafe, the lab moved to a converted apartment building in [[Coral Gables, Florida]] near the main campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/about-rsmas/history/|title=The History of the Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Science|first=Jean|last=Yehle|work=www.rsmas.miami.edu|accessdate=2011-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525183106/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/about-rsmas/history/|archive-date=2011-05-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, a delegation from [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] prompted the [[Florida State Legislature]] to support the development of a state Marine Laboratory in conjunction with the UM lab. It reported to the [[Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission|State Board of Conservation]], which had no marine research facility and little budget of its own at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AGQpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KMgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3195,6215129&amp;dq=florida+marine+laboratory&amp;hl=en|title=State Adds $25,000 in Tide Fight|work=Daytona Beach Morning Journal |date=January 27, 1954|page=5|quote=The Legislature appropriated $80,000 per year for research work and specified that it be paid from shell revenues.|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship lasted for 12 years until the state of Florida built the board a lab in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]. In 1953, the School's classrooms and laboratories were built at the current Virginia Key location. It was renamed the Institute of Marine Science in 1961,&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|title=Dorothy H. and Lewis Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science|url=http://www6.miami.edu/umbulletin/und/marine/index.htm|accessdate=November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became part of the University of Miami's School of Environmental and Planetary Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Semiannual Status Report NASA GRANT NGR-10-007-010|date=October 31, 1966|url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19670082520_1967082520.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, the institution was made into an independent school and named to honor [[Lewis Rosenstiel|Lewis and Dorothy Rosenstiel]] after a major contribution from the Rosenstiel's foundation to support progress in atmospheric and marine sciences. In 1977, the school began a joint undergraduate program with Miami's College of Arts &amp; Sciences.&lt;ref name=msc/&gt; The school bought Research vessels and built more facilities to further research projects. From 2003 to 2008, the school operated the Pew Institute for Ocean Science as a joint venture with the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]], and in 2008, the program relocated to [[SUNY at Stony Brook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aafcseafood.org/Documents/conquest_of_the_ocean.pdf|title=Conquest of the Ocean|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stony Brook Southampton Broadens Scope With Ocean Conservation Institute|url=http://www.hamptons.com/detail.php?articleID=4646|first=Kelly |last=Carroll|work=hamptons.com|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, RSMAS took over administrative functions of the University of Miami's undergraduate Marine Science, Marine Affairs, and Meteorology programs.&lt;ref name="msc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/pressreleases/20080820-rsmas.html|title=University of Miami&amp;rsquo;s Rosenstiel School Prepares to Launch Historic Academic Year|accessdate=October 17, 2008|date=August 20, 2008|publisher=University of Miami|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122033210/http://rsmas.miami.edu/pressreleases/20080820-rsmas.html|archive-date=2008-11-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www6.miami.edu/umbulletin/pdf/RSMASGrad201011.pdf|title=Dorothy H. and Lewis Rosentiel School Of Marine And Atmospheric Science - Graduate|publisher=University of Miami|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 2008, RSMAS's library merged with the central University of Miami Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/2008_Annual_Report.pdf|title=2008 Rosenstiel Annual Report|page=1|publisher=University of Miami|accessdate=February 2, 2011|archivedate=July 23, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723105857/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/2008_Annual_Report.pdf|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, RSMAS started unique a one-year Master of Professional Science degree program aimed at students planning non-research careers in business, government, or non-profit organizations.&lt;ref name=mps /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mps.rsmas.miami.edu/about/|title=About the Program|publisher=University of Miami|accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==

In addition to the academic divisions, RSMAS also has several research units: the Oceans and Human Health Center, the National Resource for ''[[Aplysia]]'', the National Center for Coral Reef Research, the [[Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing]] (CSTARS), and the [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]]. {{As of|2011}}, 358 professors and scientists conduct research programs and teach at RSMAS and the Coral Gables campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.edu/planning-research/FBFA2010.pdf|title=Fall 2010 Fact Book|publisher=University of Miami Office of Planning, Institutional Research &amp; Assessment|page=125|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 81 are regular full-time faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.edu/planning-research/FBFA2010.pdf|title=Fall 2010 Fact Book|publisher=University of Miami Office of Planning, Institutional Research &amp; Assessment|page=122|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school operates the ''F.G. Walton Smith'' [[research vessel]]. Designed to met the school's specifications, the [[catamaran]] was put on water in 2000. It is equipped with a special sea water flow system that can take samples. The on-board lab can perform chemical analysis of those water samples. It also has [[transducer]]s for measuring ocean currents, sub-bottom profiling, and deep water [[bathymetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/support/mardep/cat/FGWSBrochure.pdf|title=F.

'''Seismic tomography''' is a technique for imaging the subsurface of the Earth with seismic waves produced by earthquakes or explosions. [[P-wave|P-]], [[S-wave|S-]], and surface waves can be used for tomographic models of different resolutions based on seismic wavelength, wave source distance, and the seismograph array coverage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-3899-1_1|title=Seismic wave propagation and seismic tomography|last=Nolet|first=G.|date=1987-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789027725837|editor-last=Nolet|editor-first=Guust|series=Seismology and Exploration Geophysics|pages=1–23|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-009-3899-1_1#page-1|doi-broken-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data received at seismometers are used to solve an inverse problem, wherein the locations of reflection and refraction of the wave paths are determined. This solution can be used to create 3D images of velocity anomalies which may be interpreted as structural, thermal, or compositional variations. [[Earth science|Geoscientists]] use these images to better understand core, mantle, and [[Plate tectonics|plate tectonic]] processes.

==Theory==
Tomography is solved as an [[inverse problem]]. Seismic travel time data are compared to an initial Earth model and the model is modified until the best possible fit between the model predictions and observed data is found. Seismic waves would travel in straight lines if Earth was of uniform composition, but the compositional layering, tectonic structure, and thermal variations reflect and refract [[seismic wave]]s. The location and magnitude of these variations can be calculated by the inversion process, although solutions to tomographic inversions are non-unique.

Seismic tomography is similar to medical x-ray [[Computed Tomography|computed tomography]] (CT scan) in that a computer processes receiver data to produce a 3D image, although CT scans use attenuation instead of traveltime difference. Seismic tomography has to deal with the analysis of curved ray paths which are reflected and refracted within the earth and potential uncertainty in the location of the earthquake [[hypocenter]]. CT scans use linear x-rays and a known source.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iris.edu/hq/inclass/downloads/optional/269|title=Seismic Tomography—Using earthquakes to image Earth's interior|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS)|access-date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Seismic tomography requires large datasets of [[seismogram]]s and well-located earthquake or explosion sources. These became more widely available in the 1960s with the expansion of global seismic networks and in the 1970s when digital seismograph data archives were established. These developments occurred concurrently with advancements in computing power that were required to solve inverse problems and generate theoretical seismograms for model testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/about/workshops/thailand/downloads/CSMpp1_History.pdf|title=A Brief History of Seismology|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United States Geologic Survey (USGS)|access-date=4 May 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803190244/https://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/about/workshops/thailand/downloads/CSMpp1_History.pdf|archivedate=3 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
Seismic tomography uses seismic records to create 2D and 3D images of subsurface anomalies by solving large inverse problems such that generate models consistent with observed data. Various methods are used to resolve anomalies in the crust and lithosphere, shallow mantle, whole mantle, and core based on the availability of data and types of seismic waves that penetrate the region at a suitable wavelength for feature resolution. The accuracy of the model is limited by availability and accuracy of seismic data, wave type utilized, and assumptions made in the model.

P-wave data are used in most local models and global models in areas with sufficient earthquake and seismograph density. S- and surface wave data are used in global models when this coverage is not sufficient, such as in ocean basins and away from subduction zones. First-arrival times are the most widely used, but models utilizing [[Seismic wave#Notation|reflected and refracted phases]] are used in more complex models, such as those imaging the core. Differential traveltimes between wave phases or types are also used.

=== Local tomography ===
Local tomographic models are often based on  a temporary seismic array targeting specific areas, unless in a seismically active region with extensive permanent network coverage. These allow for the imaging of the crust and upper mantle. 
* ''Diffraction and wave equation tomography'' use the full waveform, rather than just the first arrival times. The inversion of amplitude and phases of all arrivals provide more detailed density information than transmission traveltime alone. Despite the theoretical appeal, these methods are not widely employed because of the computing expense and difficult inversions.
* ''Reflection tomography'' originated with [[exploration geophysics]]. It uses an artificial source to resolve small-scale features at crustal depths. ''Wide-angle tomography'' is similar, but with a wide source to receiver offset. This allows for the detection of seismic waves refracted from sub-crustal depths and can determine continental architecture and details of plate margins. These two methods are often used together.
* ''Local earthquake tomography'' is used in seismically active regions with sufficient seismometer coverage. Given the proximity between source and receivers, a precise earthquake focus location must be known. This requires the simultaneous iteration of both structure and focus locations in model calculations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* ''Teleseismic tomography'' uses waves from distant earthquakes that deflect upwards to a local seismic array. The models can reach depths similar to the array aperture, typically to depths for imaging the crust and lithosphere (a few hundred kilometers). The waves travel near 30° from vertical, creating a vertical distortion to compact features.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebpagePDFs/Seismology.pdf|title=Seismology: The Hunt for Plumes|last=Julian|first=Bruce|date=2006|website=|publisher=mantleplumes.org|access-date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FarallonTomoSlice.png|thumb|267x267px|Simplified and interpreted P- and S-wave velocity variations in the mantle across southern North America showing the subducted Farallon Plate.]]
Regional to global scale tomographic models are generally based on long wavelengths. Various models have better agreement with each other than local models due to the large feature size they image, such as [[Subduction|subducted slabs]] and [[Large low-shear-velocity provinces|superplumes]]. The trade off from whole mantle to whole earth coverage is the coarse resolution (hundreds of kilometers) and difficulty imaging small features (e.g. narrow plumes). Although often used to image different parts of the subsurface, P- and S-wave derived models broadly agree where there is image overlap. These models use data from both permanent seismic stations and supplementary temporary arrays. 
* First arrival traveltime ''P-wave'' data are used to generate the highest resolution tomographic images of the mantle. These models are limited to regions with sufficient seismograph coverage and earthquake density, therefore cannot be used for areas such as inactive plate interiors and ocean basins without seismic networks. Other phases of P-waves are used to image the deeper mantle and core.
* In areas with limited [[seismograph]] or earthquake coverage, multiple phases of ''S-waves'' can be used for tomographic models. These are of lower resolution than P-wave models, due to the distances involved and fewer bounce-phase data available. S-waves can also be used in conjunction with P-waves for differential arrival time models.
* ''Surface waves'' can be used for tomography of the crust and upper mantle where no body wave (P and S) data are available. Both Rayleigh and Love waves can be used. The low frequency waves lead to low resolution models, therefore these models have difficulty with crustal structure. ''Free oscillations'', or normal mode [[seismology]], are the long wavelength, low frequency movements of the surface of the earth which can be thought of as a type of surface wave. The frequencies of these oscillations can be obtained through [[Fourier transform]]ation of seismic data. The models based on this method are of broad scale, but have the advantage of relatively uniform data coverage as compared to data sourced directly from earthquakes. 
* ''[[Attenuation]] tomography'' attempts to extract the anaelastic signal from the elastic-dominated waveform of seismic waves. The advantage of this method is its sensitivity to temperature, thus ability to image thermal features such as mantle plumes and subduction zones. Both surface and body waves have been used in this approach. 
* ''Ambient noise tomography'' cross-correlates waveforms from random wavefields generated by oceanic and atmospheric disturbances. A major advantage of this method is that unlike other methods, it does not require an earthquake or other event to occur in order to produce results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shapiro |first1=N. M. |title=High-Resolution Surface-Wave Tomography from Ambient Seismic Noise |journal=Science |date=11 March 2005 |volume=307 |issue=5715 |pages=1615–1618 |doi=10.1126/science.1108339|pmid=15761151 |bibcode=2005Sci...307.1615S |citeseerx=10.1.1.399.6167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. A disadvantage of the method is that it requires a significant amount of time, usually a minimum of one year but several years of data collection are also common. This method has produced high-resolution images and is an area of active research. 
* [[Waveform]]s are modeled as rays in seismic analysis, but all waves are affected by the material near the [[Banana Doughnut theory|ray path.]] The finite frequency effect is the result the surrounding medium has on a seismic record. ''Finite frequency tomography'' accounts for this in determining both travel time and amplitude anomalies, increasing image resolution. This has the ability to resolve much larger variations (i.e. 10–30%) in material properties.

==Applications==
Seismic tomography can resolve anisotropy, anelasticity, density, and bulk sound density.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Variations in these parameters may be a result of thermal or chemical differences, which are attributed to processes such as mantle plumes, subducting slabs, and mineral phase changes. Larger scale features that can be imaged with tomography include the high velocities beneath [[Shield (geology)|continental shields]] and low velocities under [[Mid-ocean ridge|ocean spreading centers]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Hotspots ===
[[File:Cartoon of African LLSVP.jpg|thumb|235x235px|The African large low-shear-velocity province (superplume)]]
The mantle plume hypothesis proposes that areas of volcanism not readily explained by plate tectonics, called [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]], are a result of thermal upwelling from as deep as the core-mantle boundary that become [[diapir]]s in the crust. This is an actively contested theory,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; although tomographic images suggest there are anomalies beneath some hotspots. The best imaged of these are large low-shear-velocity provinces, or superplumes, visible on S-wave models of the lower mantle and believed to reflect both thermal and compositional differences.

The [[Yellowstone hotspot]] is responsible for volcanism at the [[Yellowstone Caldera]] and a series of extinct calderas along the [[Snake River Plain]]. The Yellowstone Geodynamic Project sought to image the plume beneath the hotspot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Robert B.|last2=Jordan|first2=Michael|last3=Steinberger|first3=Bernhard|last4=Puskas|first4=Christine M.|last5=Farrell|first5=Jamie|last6=Waite|first6=Gregory P.|last7=Husen|first7=Stephan|last8=Chang|first8=Wu-Lung|last9=O'Connell|first9=Richard|date=2009-11-20|title=Geodynamics of the Yellowstone hotspot and mantle plume: Seismic and GPS imaging, kinematics, and mantle flow|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027309003308|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|series=The Track of the Yellowstone HotspotWhat do Neotectonics, Climate Indicators, Volcanism, and Petrogenesis Reveal about Subsurface Processes?|volume=188|issue=1–3|pages=26–56|doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2009.08.020|bibcode=2009JVGR..188...26S}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found a strong low-velocity body from ~30 to 250&amp;nbsp;km depth beneath Yellowstone and a weaker anomaly from 250 to 650&amp;nbsp;km depth which dipped 60° west-northwest. The authors attribute these features to the mantle plume beneath the hotspot being deflected eastward by flow in the upper mantle seen in S-wave models.

The [[Hawaii hotspot]] produced the [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain]]. Tomographic images show it to be 500 to 600&amp;nbsp;km wide and up to 2,000&amp;nbsp;km deep.

=== Subduction zones ===
Subducting plates are colder than the mantle into which they are moving. This creates a fast anomaly that is visible in tomographic images. Both the [[Farallon Plate|Farallon plate]] that subducted beneath the west coast of North America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iris.edu/hq/files/programs/education_and_outreach/lessons_and_resources/docs/es_tomography.pdf|title=Seismic Tomography|last=|first=|date=|website=earthscope.org|publisher=Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS)|access-date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the northern portion of the [[Indian Plate|Indian plate]] that has subducted beneath Asia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Replumaz|first=Anne|last2=Negredo|first2=Ana M.|last3=Guillot|first3=Stéphane|last4=Villaseñor|first4=Antonio|date=2010-03-01|title=Multiple episodes of continental subduction during India/Asia convergence: Insight from seismic tomography and tectonic reconstruction|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040195109005666|journal=Tectonophysics|series=Convergent plate margin dynamics: New perspectives from structural geology, geophysics and geodynamic modelling|volume=483|issue=1–2|pages=125–134|doi=10.1016/j.tecto.2009.10.007|bibcode=2010Tectp.483..125R}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been imaged with tomography.

==Limitations==
Global seismic networks have expanded steadily since the 1960s, but are still concentrated on continents and in seismically active regions. Oceans, particularly in the southern hemisphere, are under-covered.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Tomographic models in these areas will improve when more data becomes available. The uneven distribution of earthquakes naturally biases models to better resolution in seismically active regions.

The type of wave used in a model limits the resolution it can achieve. Longer wavelengths are able to penetrate deeper into the earth, but can only be used to resolve large features. Finer resolution can be achieved with surface waves, with the trade off that they cannot be used in models of the deep mantle. The disparity between wavelength and feature scale causes anomalies to appear of reduced magnitude and size in images. P- and S-wave models respond differently to the types of anomalies depending on the driving material property. First arrival time based models naturally prefer faster pathways, causing models based on these data to have lower resolution of slow (often hot) features.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Shallow models must also consider the significant lateral velocity variations in continental crust.

Seismic tomography provides only the current velocity anomalies. Any prior structures are unknown and the slow rates of movement in the subsurface (mm to cm per year) prohibit resolution of changes over modern timescales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/Penrose/PenPDFAbstracts/Dziewonski_Adam_abs.pdf|title=Global Seismic Tomography: What we really can say and what we make up|last=Dziewonski|first=Adam|date=|website=|publisher=mantleplumes.org|access-date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomographic solutions are non-unique. Although statistical methods can be used to analyze the validity of a model, unresolvable uncertainty remains.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This contributes to difficulty comparing the validity of different model results.

Computing power limits the amount of seismic data, number of unknowns, mesh size, and iterations in tomographic models. This is of particular importance in ocean basins, which due to limited network coverage and earthquake density require more complex processing of distant data. Shallow oceanic models also require smaller model mesh size due to the thinner crust.&lt;ref name="Liu 31–66"/&gt;

Tomographic images are typically presented with a color ramp representing the strength of the anomalies. This has the consequence of making equal changes appear of differing magnitude based on visual perceptions of color, such as the change from orange to red being more subtle than blue to yellow. The degree of color saturation can also visually skew interpretations. These factors should be considered when analyzing images.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Clare College, Cambridge, July 2010 (16).JPG|thumb|Clare College, University of Cambridge a regular venue for the Social Stratification Seminars.]]
The '''Social Stratification Research Seminar (UK)''' is an annual research colloquium for original, empirically informed [[Sociology|sociological]] presentations on [[social stratification]]. The Social Stratification Research Seminars have been running almost every autumn since 1968. The seminars have mainly been hosted at the [[University of Cambridge]] and were often organised by the [https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/social-science-research-group Social Science Research Group (formerly the Sociological Research Group)]. The seminars have also been held at the [[Cardiff University|University of Cardiff (]]2003-5), the [[University of Edinburgh]] (2014, 2017), the [[University of Milan]] (2015), the [[University of Stirling]] (2007, 2011) and [[Utrecht University]] (2010).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.camsis.stir.ac.uk/stratif/conf_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The original movers and shakers behind the seminar were three distinguished British scholars working in the field of social stratification - [https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/professor-robert-martin-bob-blackburn Professor Robert (Bob) Blackburn],  [https://www.fitz.cam.ac.uk/about/people/fellows-profiles/professor-ken-prandy Professor Ken Prandy,] and Professor Alexander (Sandy) Stewart. Since the early part of this [[Year 2000|millennium]] the seminar has been organised by [https://www.stir.ac.uk/people/255764 Professor Paul Lambert], who is Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Stirling]] and a longstanding fan of [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion F.C]]. The annual call for papers is usually issued in the spring and the seminar is usually held on two consecutive days in the early September. Proposals for papers for presentations are invited from any area of research into social stratification and social inequality.  The organizers do not usually limit the number of delegates attending. There are no parallel sessions and therefore there is an upper limit on the number of paper presentations that can be accommodated.

A salient feature of the Social Stratification Research Seminars has been how to appropriately measure social stratification in contemporary societies. An approach that has been developed by researchers who are regular contributors to the seminars are Social Interaction and Stratification Scales.&lt;ref&gt;See Stewart, A., PRANDY, K. and Blackburn, R.M., 1973. Measuring the class structure. ''Nature'', ''245''(5426), p.415.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is the foundation of the [http://www.camsis.stir.ac.uk/ CAMSIS Project] which is an internationally comparative assessment of the structures of social interaction and stratification across a number of countries.

A number of prominent research publications contain work that was developed and showcased at the seminars. These works include an edited volume entitled [https://www.routledge.com/Social-Stratification-Trends-and-Processes/Connelly-Gayle-Lambert/p/book/9781409430964 ''Social stratification:Trends and processes'']&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, P., Connelly, M.R., Blackburn, R.M. and Gayle, V. eds., 2013.

Ashgate Publishing, Ltd..&lt;/ref&gt;'','' and special issues of the journal ''[https://rsa.tandfonline.com/toc/rsoc21/11/2-3?nav=tocList Contemporary Social Science]'' and the [https://www.emeraldinsight.com/toc/ijssp/28/7%2F8 ''International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy''] [https://www.emeraldinsight.com/toc/ijssp/28/5%2F6].

Notable sociological scholars in the field of social stratification who have attended the Social Stratification Research Seminars include [https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&amp;user=-abxxmUAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate Professor Harry Ganzeboom], [https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=gscMj2wAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=sra Dr Wendy Bottero], [https://www.ncl.ac.uk/gps/staff/profile/geoffpayne.html#publications Professor Geoff Payne], [https://www.unibas.ch/en/University/Administration-Services/The-President-s-Office/Institutional-Development/Sustainability/Research/Social-Sciences.html Professor Max Bergman], and [http://www.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/Experts/profile.aspx?KeyValue=l.platt@lse.ac.uk Professor Lucinda Platt].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4998">'''Things of Science''' was an educational program launched by the nonprofit news syndicate [[Society for Science &amp; the Public|Science Service]] in November 1940.  The program consisted of a series of kits available by [[subscription]] and sent by mail monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/doc/510949846.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Apr%2022,%201967&amp;author=By%20Cynthia%20Parsons%20Education%20editor%20of%20The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor&amp;pub=Christian%20Science%20Monitor&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Discovery%20comes%20in%20a%20box|title=Discovery comes in a box|last=Parsons|first=Cynthia|date=April 22, 1967|work=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program continued until 1989. {{asof|2018}}, there is no mention of the program or its archives on the website of the Society for Science &amp; the Public, which succeeded the old Science Service organization.

Each month, thousands of subscribers received a small blue box about the size of a [[VHS|videocasette]] containing some material such as nylon thread or dinosaur bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/djreprints/doc/131610860.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Aug%2029,%201946&amp;author=&amp;pub=Wall%20Street%20Journal&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Thing-of-the-Month%20Club%20Gets%20Industry%20Aid%20For%20Its%20Science%20Service|title=Thing-of-the-Month Club Gets Industry Aid For Its Science Service|last=Robitscher|first=Jonas|date=August 29, 1946|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The box contained a yellow booklet explaining the topic for that month, along with the pieces and supplies needed to cover the topic.  Some kits would teach about a specific topic, such as [[coal]], [[static electricity]], [[mechanical linkage]]s, [[nonwoven fabric]]s, [[electroplating]], or [[optical illusions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vxVSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_XYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2361,370608&amp;dq=things-of-science&amp;hl=en|title=Experimental unit shows seeing not believing|date=August 21, 1959|work=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other kits would provide parts to build items such as a small [[spectrograph]], [[telescope]], or [[pinhole camera]]. In addition to the monthly subscription, some kits were available for individual purchase, such as a "soilless gardening" unit which provided seeds, plant food, and instructions in [[hydroponics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vWFkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=U3wNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4160,2587703&amp;dq=things-of-science&amp;hl=en|title=New Kit Grows Plants Without Soil|date=May 11, 1961|work=Calgary Herald|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some kits contained basic materials for simple experiments in psychology.&lt;ref name="Schlosberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schlosberg |first1=Harold |title=Things of Science. |journal=American Psychologist |date=1953 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=124–125 |doi=10.1037/h0053882 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modest annual subscription price ($5 in the 1960s) covered the cost of printing and postage.

The Things of Science Club was started by Watson Davis, editor-in-chief of Science Service, because editors served by the service often asked for samples of the things the syndicate wrote about. The initial focus of the program was newspaper editors, but it soon shifted to young people. By 1946 the Science Service estimated that half of its subscribers were school groups and science clubs, and the other half were individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecg.mit.edu/george/tos/|title=Rediscovering Things of Science|last=Moody|first=George B.|work=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in the club was limited to a few thousand because some of the "things", such as dinosaur bones, were hard to come by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1hwiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QKQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4985,4298460&amp;dq=things-of-science&amp;hl=en|title=Thing-of-the-Month Club will provide remarkable objects|last=Othman|first=Frederick C.|date=October 7, 1947|work=San Jose Evening News|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St Kentigerns Church HDR (8226826999).jpg|thumb|Tone mapped high-dynamic-range (HDR) image of St. Kentigerns Roman Catholic Church in Blackpool, Lancashire, England, UK]]

'''Tone mapping''' is a technique used in [[image processing]] and [[computer graphics]] to [[Map (mathematics)|map]] one set of colors to another to approximate the appearance of [[High-dynamic-range imaging|high-dynamic-range images]] in a medium that has a more limited [[dynamic range]]. [[Print-out]]s, [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] or [[LCD]] monitors, and projectors all have a limited dynamic range that is inadequate to reproduce the full range of light intensities present in natural scenes. Tone mapping addresses the problem of strong contrast reduction from the scene [[radiance]] to the displayable range while preserving the image details and color appearance important to appreciate the original scene content.

==Background==

The introduction of film-based photography created issues since capturing the enormous dynamic range of lighting from the real world on a chemically limited negative was very difficult. Early film developers attempted to remedy this issue by designing the film stocks and the print development systems that gave a desired [[Sigmoid function|S-shaped tone curve]] with slightly enhanced contrast (about 15%) in the middle range and gradually compressed highlights and shadows {{ref|hunt}}.  Photographers have also used [[dodging and burning]] to overcome the limitations of the print process {{ref|adams}}.

The advent of digital photography gave hope for better solutions to this problem. One of the earliest algorithms employed by Land and McCann in 1971 was Retinex, inspired by theories of lightness perception {{ref|land}}.This method is inspired by the eye’s biological mechanisms of adaptation when lighting conditions are an issue. Gamut mapping algorithms were also extensively studied in the context of color printing. Computational models such as CIECAM02 or iCAM were used to predict color appearance. Despite this, if algorithms could not sufficiently map tones and colors, a skilled artist was still needed, as is the case with cinematographic movie post-processing.

Computer graphic techniques capable of rendering high-contrast scenes shifted the focus from color to luminance as the main limiting factor of display devices. Several tone mapping operators were developed to map high dynamic range (HDR) images to standard displays. More recently, this work has branched away from utilizing luminance to extend image contrast and towards other methods such as user-assisted image reproduction. Currently, image reproduction has shifted towards display-driven solutions since displays now possess advanced image processing algorithms that help adapt rendering of the image to viewing conditions, save power, up-scale color gamut and dynamic range.

==Purpose and methods==

The goals of tone mapping can be differently stated depending on the particular application. In some cases producing just aesthetically pleasing images is the main goal, while other applications might emphasize reproducing as many image details as possible, or maximizing the image contrast. The goal in realistic rendering applications might be to obtain a perceptual match between a real scene and a displayed image even though the display device is not able to reproduce the full range of luminance values.

Various tone mapping operators have been developed in the recent years.{{ref|devlin}} They all can be divided in two main types:
*''global'' (or ''spatially uniform'') operators: they are non-linear functions based on the luminance and other global variables of the image. Once the optimal function has been estimated according to the particular image, every pixel in the image is mapped in the same way, independent of the value of surrounding pixels in the image. Those techniques are simple and fast&lt;ref&gt;G. Qiu et al, [http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~qiu/webpages/Papers/icpr2006-hdri-camera.pdf "Tone Mapping for HDR Image using Optimization-A New Closed Form Solution"], Proc. ICPR 2006, 18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, vol.1, pp.996-999&lt;/ref&gt; (since they can be implemented using [[look-up table]]s), but they can cause a loss of contrast.  Examples of common global tone mapping methods are contrast reduction and [[Negative (photography)|color inversion]].
*''local'' (or ''spatially varying'') operators: the parameters of the non-linear function change in each pixel, according to features extracted from the surrounding parameters. In other words, the effect of the algorithm changes in each pixel according to the local features of the image. Those algorithms are more complicated than the global ones; they can show artifacts (e.g. halo effect and ringing); and the output can look unrealistic, but they can (if used correctly) provide the best performance, since human vision is mainly sensitive to local contrast.

A simple example of global tone mapping filter is &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}}=\frac{V_{\text{in}}}{V_{\text{in}}+1},&lt;/math&gt; where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[luminance (relative)|luminance]] of the original pixel and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; is the luminance of the filtered pixel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reinhard|first1=Erik|title=Photographic tone reproduction for digital images.|journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics|date=2002|volume= 21|issue= 3|url=http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~peyre/cours/x2005signal/hdr_photographic.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This function will map the luminance ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; in the domain &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; to a displayable output range of &lt;math&gt;[0,1).&lt;/math&gt; While this filter provides a decent [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] for parts of the image with low luminance (particularly when {{math|{{var|V}}{{sub|in}} &lt; 1}}), parts of the image with higher luminance will get increasingly lower contrast as the luminance of the filtered image goes to 1.

A perhaps more useful global tone mapping method is [[gamma compression]], which has the filter &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}}=A\,V_{\text{in}}^{\gamma},&lt;/math&gt; where {{math|{{var|A}} &gt; 0}} and {{math|0 &lt; {{var|γ}} &lt; 1}}. This function will map the luminance ''V''{{sub|in}} in the domain &lt;math&gt;[0,A^{-1/\gamma}]&lt;/math&gt; to the output range &lt;math&gt;[0,1].&lt;/math&gt; ''γ'' regulates the contrast of the image; a lower value for lower contrast. While a lower constant ''γ'' gives a lower contrast and perhaps also a duller image, it increases the exposure of underexposed parts of the image while at the same time, if {{math|{{var|A}} &lt; 1}}, it can decrease the exposure of overexposed parts of the image enough to prevent them from being overexposed.

An even more sophisticated group of tone mapping algorithms is based on contrast or [[Gradient Domain Image Processing|gradient domain]] methods, which are 'local'. Such operators concentrate on preserving contrast between neighboring regions rather than absolute value, an approach motivated by the fact that the human perception is most sensitive to contrast in images rather than absolute intensities. Those tone mapping methods usually produce very sharp images, which preserve very well small contrast details; however, this is often done at the cost of flattening an overall image contrast, and may as a side effect produce [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]-like glows around dark objects. Examples of such tone mapping methods include: [[gradient domain high dynamic range compression]]{{ref|fattal}} and A Perceptual Framework for Contrast Processing of High Dynamic Range Images{{ref|mantiuk}} (a tone mapping is one of the applications of this framework).

Another approach to tone mapping of HDR images is inspired by the [[anchoring theory of lightness perception]].{{ref|gilchrist}} This theory explains many characteristics of the human visual system such as lightness constancy and its failures (as in the [[checker shadow illusion]]), which are important in the perception of images.  The key concept of this tone mapping method (Lightness Perception in Tone Reproduction{{ref|krawczyk}}) is a decomposition of an HDR image into areas (frameworks) of consistent illumination and the local calculation of the lightness values. The net lightness of an image is calculated by merging of the frameworks proportionally to their strength. Particularly important is the anchoring—relating of the luminance to a known luminance, namely estimating which luminance value is perceived as white in the scene. This approach to tone mapping does not affect the local contrast and preserves the natural colors of an HDR image due to the linear handling of luminance.

One simple form of tone mapping takes a standard image (not HDR – the dynamic range already compressed) and applies [[unsharp masking]] with a large radius, which increases local contrast rather than sharpening. See [[Unsharp masking#Local contrast enhancement|unsharp masking: local contrast enhancement]] for details.

One of the commonly used tone mapping algorithms is the iCAM06 which is based on both the [[color appearance model]] and hierarchical mapping.{{ref|fairchild}} After bilateral filtering, the image is broken into a base layer and a detail layer. White point adaptation and chrominance adaptation are applied to the base layer, while detail enhancement is applied to the detail layer. Eventually the two layers are merged and converted to the IPT color space. In general, this method is good but has some shortcomings, specifically in how computationally heavy the filtering method is. A proposed solution{{ref|xiao}} to this involves performance optimization of the filter. The base layer of the image is also converted to the RGB space for tone compression. This method also allows for more output adjustment and saturation enhancement, making it be less computationally intensive and better at reducing the overall halo effect.

==Digital photography==
[[Image:Dundus Square.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Tone mapped HDR image of [[Dundas Square]]; Tone mapping was done as post-processing technique, using Photomatix photographic software.]]
Forms of tone mapping long precede digital photography. The manipulation of film and development process to render high contrast scenes, especially those shot in bright sunlight, on printing paper with a relatively low dynamic range, is effectively a form of tone mapping, although it is not usually called that. Local adjustment of tonality in film processing is primarily done via [[dodging and burning]], and is particularly advocated by and associated with [[Ansel Adams]], as described in his book ''The Print;'' see also his [[Zone System]].

The normal process of [[exposure compensation]], brightening shadows and altering contrast applied globally to digital images as part of a professional or serious amateur workflow is also a form of tone mapping.

However, HDR tone mapping, usually using ''local operators,'' has become increasingly popular amongst digital photographers as a post-processing technique, where several exposures at different shutter speeds are combined to produce an HDR image and a tone mapping operator is then applied to the result. There are now many examples of locally tone mapped digital images, inaccurately known as "HDR photographs", on the internet, and these are of varying quality. This popularity is partly driven by the distinctive appearance of locally tone mapped images, which many people find attractive, and partly by a desire to capture high-contrast scenes that are hard or impossible to photograph in a single exposure, and may not render attractively even when they can be captured. Although digital sensors actually capture a higher dynamic range than film, they completely lose detail in extreme highlights, clipping them to pure white, producing an unattractive result when compared with negative film, which tends to retain colour and some detail in highlights.

In some cases local tone mapping is used even though the dynamic range of the source image could be captured on the target media, either to produce the distinctive appearance of a locally tone mapped image, or to produce an image closer to the photographer's artistic vision of the scene by removing sharp contrasts, which often look unattractive. In some cases, tone mapped images are produced from a single exposure which is then manipulated with conventional processing tools to produce the inputs to the HDR image generation process. This avoids the artifacts that can appear when different exposures are combined, due to moving objects in the scene or camera shake. However, when tone mapping is applied to a single exposure in this way, the intermediate image has only normal dynamic range, and the amount of shadow or highlight detail that can be rendered is only that which was captured in the original exposure.

==Display devices==

One of the original goals of tone mapping was to be able to reproduce a given scene or image onto a display device such that the brightness sensation of the image to a human viewer closely matches the real-world brightness sensation. However, a perfect match for this problem is never possible and thus the output image on a display is often built from a tradeoff between different image features. Choosing between features is often based on the necessary application, and given appropriate metrics for the application, one possible solution is to treat the issue as an optimization problem{{ref|mantiukdaly}}.

For this method, models for the Human Visual System (HVS) and the display are first generated, along with a simple tone mapping operator. The contrast distortions are weighted according to their individual visibilities approximated by the HVS. With these models, an objective function that defines the tone curve can be created and solved using a fast quadratic solver.

With the addition of filters, this method can also be extended to videos. The filters ensure that the rapid changing of the tone-curve between frames are not salient in the final output image.

==Example of the imaging process==

[[Image:Old saint pauls 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Tone mapped [[high dynamic range imaging|High dynamic range image]] example showing stained glass windows in south alcove of [[Old Saint Paul's]], [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]].]]

[[Image:HDRI-Example.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The six individual exposures used to create the previous image. In the low exposure images, the room is dark and unclear, but the details of the windows are visible. In the high exposure images, the windows are bright and unclear, but the details of the room are revealed.]]

The images on the right show the interior of a church, a scene which has a variation in radiance much larger than that which can be displayed on a monitor or recorded by a conventional camera. The six individual exposures from the camera show the radiance of the scene in some range transformed to the range of brightnesses that can be displayed on a monitor. The range of radiances recorded in each photo is limited, so not all details can be displayed at once: for example, details of the dark church interior cannot be displayed at the same time as those of the bright stained-glass window. An algorithm is applied to the six images to recreate the high dynamic range radiance map of the original scene (a [[high dynamic range image]]). Alternatively, some higher-end consumer and specialist scientific digital cameras are able to record a high dynamic range image directly, for example with [[Raw image format|RAW]] images.

In the ideal case, a camera might measure [[luminance]] directly and store this in the HDR image; however, most high dynamic range images produced by cameras today are not calibrated or even proportional to luminance, due to practical reasons such as cost and time required to measure accurate luminance values &amp;mdash; it is often sufficient for artists to use multiple exposures to gain an "HDR image" which grossly approximates the true luminance signal.

The high dynamic range image is passed to a tone mapping operator, in this case a local operator, which transforms the image into a low dynamic range image suitable for viewing on a monitor. Relative to the church interior, the stained-glass window is displayed at a much lower brightness than a linear mapping between scene radiance and pixel intensity would produce. However, this inaccuracy is perceptually less important than the image detail, which can now be shown in both the window and the church interior simultaneously.

==Visual effect==

Local tone mapping produces a number of characteristic effects in images. These include halos around dark objects, a "painting-like" or "cartoon-like" appearance due to a lack of large global contrasts, and highly saturated colours. Many people find the resulting images attractive and these effects to add an interesting new set of choices for post-processing in digital photography. Some people believe that the results stray too far from realism, or find them unattractive, but these are aesthetic judgements, and often concern the choices made by the photographer during the tone mapping process, rather than being a necessary consequence of using tone mapping.

Not all tone mapped images are visually distinctive. Reducing dynamic range with tone mapping is often useful in bright sunlit scenes, where the difference in intensity between direct illumination and shadow is great. In these cases the global contrast of the scene is reduced, but the local contrast maintained, while the image as a whole continues to look natural. Use of tone mapping in this context may not be apparent from the final image:
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Grand Canyon HDR imaging.jpg|Regions of direct illumination and shadow on the Grand Canyon
Image:Bucket_of_fresh-picked_cherries.jpg
File:Lamp base at N.Y. Public Library - Schwarzman Bldg. - exterior.jpg|Cartoon-like appearance
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Tone mapping can also produce distinctive visual effects in the final image, such as the visible halo around the tower in the Cornell Law School image below. It can be used to produce these effects even when the dynamic range of the original image is not particularly high. Halos in images come about because the local tone mapping operator will brighten areas around dark objects, to maintain the local contrast in the original image, which fools the human  visual system into perceiving the dark objects as being dark, even if their actual luminance is the same as that of areas of the image perceived as being bright. Usually this effect is subtle, but if the contrasts in the original image are extreme, or the photographer deliberately sets the luminance gradient to be very steep, the halos become visible.

'''Universidad de Concepción''' ('''UdeC'''), is a traditional Chilean private university, the work of the Penquista community, one of the most traditional and prestigious in its country, considered complex due to its extensive research in the various areas of knowledge. Founded on May 14, 1919, it is the 3rd oldest university in Chile, and 1 of the 25 universities belonging to the Council of Rectors of Chilean Universities.

Its headquarters are located in the city of Concepción, and also has 2 other campuses in [[Chillán]] and [[Los Ángeles (Chile)|Los Ángeles]]. In a citizen survey carried out in 2012, it was chosen as the symbol that most identifies Penquists.

It was the 1st University created in the center-south zone of the country, besides being the 1st to be constituted as a private law corporation and belong to the Cruz del Sur University Network; it also belongs to the G9 University Network. The University of Concepción also had a pioneering role in the reform movement of Chilean universities that took place at the end of the 60's of the 20th century. It was the 1st Chilean university that approved the University Reform in that period (1968), giving greater participation to students in university management.

Its main promoter was Chilean educator and lawyer Enrique Molina Garmendia, who sought to create the 1st secular university in Chile. As part of its educational line, the University of Concepción devotes a large part of its budget to academic research. It has in its facilities the most complete museum of Chilean art in the country, several sports centers and a network of 11 libraries, the main one occupying an area of 10,000 m² with a total of 100,000 volumes.

By 2012, the total number of graduates of this house of studies amounted to 57,000. It also teaches 23,700 students, 2,166 of them graduate programs; 72% of its professors have doctorates or master's degrees and its infrastructure, with 243,556 m² built, is one of the largest in Chile.

It is currently accredited by the National Accreditation Commission (CNA-Chile) for the maximum period of 7 years (of a maximum of 7), from November 2016 to November 2023. Figure in the 3rd position within the Chilean universities according to the webometric classification of the CSIC (July 2017) and in the 3rd position according to the AméricaEconomía 2017 ranking as well as national and international rankings. Within the Chilean universities, it is also among the 11 that figure in the QS 2017 world university ranking, among the 10 that appear in the Times Higher Education 2017 ranking, and among the 25 that appear in the ranking of Scimago Institution Rankings (SIR) 2017, with the 3rd position nationally and 572th worldwide.

Its Concepción campus was declared a National Heritage in 2016 by the Council of National Monuments of Chile; what makes it the 1st and only University in Chile to have this recognition due to the design and architectural style of its environment that has been implemented in its buildings and campus-level environment since its foundation; the proclamation grants the university special protection and conservation of the campus and its space by the state; therefore, any intervention to the same has to be reported to the Council of Monuments, while any damage and type of vandalism that jeopardizes the integrity and security of the campus will be seriously penalized according to the law that regulates and covers the National Monuments, as well as the prompt construction of the 1st and only Bío Bío Technological Science Park (PACYT) in all of Chile located in the Bío-Bío Region, near the campus of the Universidad de Concepción; which at the same time will be in charge of the administration, organization, and projection of new ideas with a view to the future of it together with the Government of Chile; this initiative is going to be projected as a productive space of the future and a relevant pole of the development of the country, the place where all the creative potential will be housed, knowledge and innovations of high impact will be generated.

==History==
[[File:Escultura en UConce.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Sculpture in honor of the founders of the University at the University Forum.]]

===Background===
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many scholars from [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] started to plead for the construction of a university for the south of [[Chile]] where it would be possible to study professional degrees outside the capital, [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]]. However, a project of this magnitude required a high level of organization, which as yet did not exist. In February 1917, the newspaper [[El Sur (newspaper)|El Sur]] reported:
{{quote|''The idea of creating a university cannot yet be possible because of "the lack of organization of those who want to create it".''|[[El Sur (newspaper)|Diario El Sur]], 1917.}}

===Committee Pro-University===
On March 23, 1917, the first official meeting took place to realise two dreams of the citizens of Concepción: a clinical hospital and a university.

After debate, a committee was named to take charge of the construction of these two projects. The projects were closely related because the hospital would become the base of the new university's medical school. Some notable members of the committee included Enrique Molina Garmendia, Pedro Nolasco, Edmundo Larenas and Virginio Gómez.

===Foundation===
The commission then presented the documentation to [[National Congress of Chile|Congress]] that would officially create the university. These were sent and approved, and on May 14, 1919, Enrique Molina Garmendia founded the university and became its first rector.

Nowadays, the university is funded by various organisations belonging to the "University of Concepción Corporation". The Lottery is one of the main organisations. With this funding, the University of Concepción has become one of the most modern and important universities in Chile.

==Organization==

The University of Concepción is divided into three campuses, located in [[Chillán]], [[Los Ángeles, Chile|Los Ángeles]] and [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]. The latter is the main and most important campus.

===Concepción Campus===

[[File:Arco de Medicina UdeC.jpg|thumb|right|The Arc of Medicine, at the entrance of the Concepción Campus]]
The university is located in the University District. The whole campus comprises what is known as the '''Ciudad Universitaria''' (University City), which also contains museums, sculptures and parks. Today, the campus has an area of 1,425,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, of which 239,856 are built upon. It is the knowledge, science, culture, technology and research centre of the city of [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]. The ''[[Presencia de América Latina]]'' mural by [[Jorge González Camarena]] is within the [[Casa del Arte (Concepción, Chile)|Casa del Arte]] on the university campus.

In 2010, the University of Concepción campus was named one of Chile’s most important architectural works from the first half of the 20th century. The "Obra Bicentenario" award distinguishes works that, in the last 100 years, have changed the face of Chile’s cities and most improved the quality of life of its inhabitants.

'''World College West''' was an undergraduate [[liberal arts college]] in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], [[California]]. Founded by Dr. [[Richard M. Gray]], it offered a program that integrated a grounding in the [[liberal arts]] with work-study and a required two-quarter "World Study" in a developing country. It opened with its first seven students on September 17, 1973.

Fully accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]], World College West had programs in International Service and Development (ISD), International Environmental Studies (IES), Art and Society (AS), and Meaning, Culture, and Change (MCC). In later years, Business and International Business was added to the program line-up. ISD focused on the economic, political, and social development of "Third World" nations; IES concentrated on the wise use and global conservation of natural resources; AS examined the relationship between culture and the performing and visual arts; and MCC focused on the variety of ways in which the world's diverse cultures, through their systems of religion, philosophy, and tradition, give meaning and purpose to human life, and to the world around us. 

The college's World Study Programs were established in [[China]], [[Mexico]], [[Nepal]], [[India]], [[Ghana]], and [[Russia]]. Students could spend two quarters (six months) studying in both an urban and rural setting in one of these countries. During the urban stay, students lived with a host family and attended regularly scheduled language, culture, and history classes. During the rural stay, students again lived with host families and conducted independent research studies while continuing to learn the country's language.

The college placed a special emphasis on work-study and internships, because the founders of the college believed that learning occurred best through "disciplined reflection on experience". Once an area of study was selected, students were required to complete 480 internship hours in their field of study as part of their graduation requirement.

During its first few years, the College leased space on the campus of the [[San Francisco Theological Seminary]] in [[San Anselmo, California|San Anselmo]], followed by several years in surplus army [[barracks]] at [[Fort Cronkhite]] on the Pacific Ocean. In the early 1980s the college built and moved to a permanent campus off [[U.S. Highway 101]] in the rolling hills of northern Marin County, between [[Novato, California|Novato]] and [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]] (now the home of the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]]).

World College West closed due to inadequate funding in Fall of 1992, the result of difficulties in succession after its founding president retired. The spirit of WCW lives on in Dick Gray's successor institution [[Presidio Graduate School]][http://www.presidiomba.org/]. The hundreds of WCW alumni call themselves "Westies".
