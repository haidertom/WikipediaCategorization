'''22 point regulation''' was a guideline approved by the [[Communist Party of China]] in 1988 to encourage [[Taiwan]]ese investments in the [[People's Republic of China]].

==Focus==
The law encouraged specifically land production and land development in [[Hainan Island]], [[Guangdong]], [[Fujian]] and other coastal provinces. It guaranteed Taiwan establishments would not be nationalized, and that exports were free from [[tariffs]]. Taiwanese management would be granted multiple [[Visa (document)|visas]].

'''Aliaume Damala Badara Akon Thiam''' (born April 16, 1973),&lt;ref name="bio.com" /&gt; known [[mononymously]] as '''Akon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|k|ɒ|n}}), is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, entrepreneur, philanthropist and actor of [[Senegalese Americans|Senegalese descent]]. He rose to prominence in 2004 following the release of "[[Locked Up (song)|Locked Up]]", the first single from his debut album ''[[Trouble (Akon album)|Trouble]]''.

He has since founded two successful record labels, [[Konvict Muzik]] and [[Kon Live Distribution]]. The labels served as a stepping stone for many soon-to-be successful acts, most notably [[Lady Gaga]], [[T-Pain]], [[R. City]], [[Kardinall Offishall]] and [[Red Café]], among others. His second album, ''[[Konvicted]]'' received three nominations for the Grammy Awards in two categories, [[Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album]] for ''[[Konvicted]]'' album and [[Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] for "[[Smack That]]" and "[[I Wanna Love You (Akon song)|I Wanna Love You]]".

He is the first solo artist to hold both the number one and two spots simultaneously on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 charts twice.&lt;ref&gt;Bronson, Fred. "[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1053124/chart-beat Chart Beat]", ''Billboard Magazine'', April 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Akon has had four songs certified as 3× platinum, three songs certified as 2× platinum, more than ten songs certified as 1× platinum and more than ten songs certified as gold in digital sales. Akon has sung songs in other languages including [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Hindi]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. He was listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the #1 selling artist for master ringtones in the world.

Akon often provides [[vocals]] as a featured artist and is currently credited with over 300 guest appearances and more than 35 [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] songs. He has had five [[Grammy Awards]] nominations and has produced records for artists such as [[Lady Gaga]], [[Colby O'Donis]], [[Kardinal Offishall]], [[Leona Lewis]], and [[Michael Jackson]].

''Forbes'' ranked Akon 80th (Power Rank) in [[Forbes Celebrity 100]] in 2010&lt;ref name="forbes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/akon/ |title=Akon |work=Forbes |date=April 18, 2012 |accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 5th in 40 Most Powerful Celebrities in Africa list, in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://channelo.dstv.com/2011/10/forbes-releases-40-most-powerful-celebrities-in-africa-list/ |title=Forbes releases "40 Most Powerful Celebrities in Africa" list &amp;#124; Channel O TV Online |publisher=Channelo.dstv.com |date=October 17, 2011 |accessdate=April 30, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102232317/http://channelo.dstv.com/2011/10/forbes-releases-40-most-powerful-celebrities-in-africa-list/ |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Billboard'' ranked Akon No. 6 on the list of Top Digital Songs Artists of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/#/charts-decade-end/digital-songs-artists?year=2009|title=Billboard - Music Charts, Music News, Artist Photo Gallery &amp; Free Video|work=Billboard|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Akon was born in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], but spent much of his childhood in the West African country [[Senegal]], which he described as his "hometown". The child of a dancer mother and a percussionist father, [[Mor Thiam]], Akon learned to play five instruments, including drums, guitar and [[djembe]].&lt;ref name=VH1_interview&gt;Bottomley, C. [http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1501105/05022005/akon.jhtml "Akon: Trouble No More] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020050755/http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1501105/05022005/akon.jhtml |date=October 20, 2011 }}". [[VH1]].com. May 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; At age 7, he moved with his family to [[Union City, New Jersey]],&lt;ref name=Billboard11.4.06&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Pg8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA36 "Deep Grooves"]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine. November 4, 2006. Page 36. Retrieved at [[Google Books]], November 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; splitting his time between the United States and Senegal until settling in [[Newark, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=VH1_interview/&gt; Growing up in New Jersey, Akon had difficulties getting along with other children. When he and his older brother reached high school, his parents left them on their own in [[Jersey City]] and moved the rest of the family to [[Atlanta]], Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Steve |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2004-10-04-otv-akon_x.htm |title=Akon, not 'Trouble,' is his middle name |work=USA Today |date=October 4, 2004 |accessdate=June 12, 2007 |quote=Akon (real name: Allaune Thiam) is the son of acclaimed Senegalese percussionist Mor Thiam, who came to the USA to tour with dancers Katherine Dunham and Alvin Ailey. Growing up, Akon had a hard time getting along with kids in New Jersey. When he and his older brother reached high school, his parents left them on their own in Jersey City and moved the family to Atlanta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to his birth date, Akon is very protective of it, which is the reason many media outlets have reported incorrect dates.

==Music career==

===2003–05: Discovery and ''Trouble''===
Akon's alleged three years in jail saw him begin to recognize his music abilities and develop an appreciation for his musical background. Music mogul Devyne Stephens, president of Upfront Megatainment first heard about Akon when the rapper [[Lil' Zane]] brought him along to Stephens' rehearsal hall, a place that at the time saw talents such as [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] and [[TLC (band)|TLC]] being developed. The relationship between Stephens and Akon began as a friendship and [[mentorship]], with the young artist regularly stopping by to ask for advice, with Stephens eventually signing him to his production company and began grooming him professionally.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JeromeFoster.html |title=Interview With Knobody |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=September 27, 2005 |accessdate=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The songs Akon recorded with Stephens were brought to the attention of [[Universal Motown Records Group|Universal]]'s imprint [[SRC Records]].&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com" /&gt; In an interview with [[HitQuarters]] SRC A&amp;R [[Knobody|Jerome "Knobody" Foster]] said, "What caught my attention right away was "Lonely", and I said, 'this kid is official – this is a huge record."&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com" /&gt; Foster and SRC CEO Steve Rifkind immediately boarded a private plane to Atlanta to meet the young artist.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com" /&gt; Akon knew of Foster's work as producer [[Knobody]] and so there was a mutual respect for one another and the pair hit it off.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com" /&gt;

Akon's solo debut album, ''[[Trouble (Akon album)|Trouble]]'' was released on June 29, 2004. It spawned the singles "[[Locked Up (song)|Locked Up]]" and "[[Lonely (Akon song)|Lonely]]", "[[Belly Dancer (Bananza)]]", "[[Pot of Gold (Akon song)|Pot Of Gold]]", and "[[Ghetto (Akon song)|Ghetto]]". "Locked Up" reached 8th position in the U.S. and 5th in the UK. "Ghetto" became a radio hit when it was [[remix]]ed by [[DJ Green Lantern]] to include verses from rappers [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]  The album is a hybrid of Akon's silky, West African-styled vocals mixed with East Coast and Southern beats. Most of Akon's songs begin with the sound of the clank of a jail cell's door with him uttering the word "Konvict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Loftus|first=Johnny|title=Akon&amp;nbsp;— Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p535592/biography|pure_url=yes}}|work=Allmusic|year=2006|accessdate=May 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, he released the single "Lonely" (which samples [[Bobby Vinton]]'s "[[Mr. Lonely]]"). The song reached the top five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and topped the charts in Australia, the UK and Germany. His album also climbed to number one in the UK in April 2005. When music channel [[The Box (UK TV channel)|The Box]] had a top ten weekly chart, which was calculated by the amount of video requests, Akon's "Lonely" became the longest running single on the top of the chart, spanning over fifteen weeks. Akon was then featured on two other singles, [[P-Money]]'s "Keep on Callin'" off the album ''[[Magic City (P-Money album)|Magic City]]'', and the other with [[New Zealand]]ian rapper, [[Savage (rapper)|Savage]] with the single "[[Moonshine (Savage song)|Moonshine]]", which had become a success in both New Zealand and Australia, becoming number one in the New Zealand charts. A year later in 2005, he made his first critically acclaimed guest appearance on [[Jeezy|Young Jeezy]]'s debut album, ''[[Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101]]'', with the song "[[Soul Survivor (Young Jeezy song)|Soul Survivor]]". In December the same year his manager, Robert Montanez was killed in a shooting after a dispute in [[New Jersey]].

In 2006, Akon and Young Jeezy suggested plans for a collaborative album.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Shaheem.

===2006–08: ''Konvicted''===
[[File:Akon.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Akon performing at the [[Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre (Charlotte)|Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], 2007.]]

[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/arts/music/10akon.html Verizon Drops Pop Singer From Ads], ''New York Times'', May 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Universal Music Group]] did not take action against Akon, but rather simply ordered the video clip be removed from video-sharing site YouTube due to [[copyright infringement]]. Conservative commentator and [[Parents Television Council]] founder [[L. Brent Bozell III|Brent Bozell]] called this "corporate irresponsibility".&lt;ref&gt;Bozell, L. Brent III.

Political commentators [[Michelle Malkin]], [[Laura Ingraham]], and [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] criticized Akon for "degrading women".&lt;ref&gt;Malkin, Michelle.

On June 3, 2007, at [[WSPK]]'s KFEST concert at the [[Dutchess Stadium]] in [[Fishkill, New York]], a concert attendee threw an object towards Akon on stage. Akon asked the crowd to identify who threw the object and that he be brought on stage. Security staff grabbed the young man and took him up to the stage. Akon then pulled him up from the crowd and hoisted him across his shoulders. The singer then tossed the attendee back into the crowd from his shoulders. Video of the incident was reviewed by Fishkill police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070829/ENT04/70829010 Police: Akon investigation continues], ''Poughkeepsie Journal'', August 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Akon has claimed that the incident was staged and that he in fact used the act to set up for the next record.&lt;ref name="Sawjani"/&gt; Charges of endangering the welfare of a minor, a misdemeanor, and second-degree harassment, a violation, were filed, according to police Chief Donald F. Williams, and Akon was arraigned on the two charges on December 3, 2007 in the town of Fishkill Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pojonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071130/NEWS05/711300344 Akon Faces Charges], ''Poughkeepsie Journal'', November 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Buddhist groups in Sri Lanka vehemently protested a planned concert by Akon, claiming his music video with Guetta for "[[Sexy Bitch|Sexy Chick]]" insulted [[Buddhism]] because of the Buddha statue that can be seen several times in the background.  Considering the allegations against Akon, the [[Sri Lankan Government]] decided not to issue him a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to enter into [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=7584 No Visa to Akon], Ada Derana News&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Coenraad Alfred Augustus Haighton''' (26 October 1896 &amp;ndash; 13 April 1943) was a millionaire businessman and the leader of the [[Netherlands]]' first [[fascist]] movement.

==Fascism==
From a privileged background, Haighton was born in [[Rotterdam]] and was well educated, studying in [[Los Angeles]] and producing a thesis on [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], although he was also physically disabled for his entire life.&lt;ref name="Rees"&gt;[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1990, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Haighton's father had been a highly successful businessman, making a fortune in particular from his [[lottery]] [[insurance]] business LOTISICO.&lt;ref name="Rees"/&gt; He died early and as such Alfred Haighton inherited the highly profitable business, allowing him to devote much of his time to politics. He soon became close to [[H.A. Sinclair de Rochemont]] and in 1924 the two set up the ''Verbond van Actualisten'', a group which looked for inspiration to [[Italian fascism]].&lt;ref name="Rees"/&gt;  The group broke down in 1927 and Haighton then put his money into a journal, ''De Bezem'' and eventually his own movement, the ''Fascistische Jongeren Bond''. This movement was depleted in 1932 when his close ally [[Jan Baars]] broke from him to set up the  [[General Dutch Fascist League]] (ANFB).&lt;ref name="Rees"/&gt;

==Nazism==
Haighton had become a strong [[anti-Semite]] and as such led the followers he had left into the [[National Socialist Dutch Workers Party]] (NSNAP), although once again his abrasive personality meant that the relationship was not to last.&lt;ref name="Rees2"&gt;Rees, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; He dropped out of politics for a spell before joining [[Arnold Meijer]]'s [[Zwart Front]], although he declined to join the [[National Front (Netherlands)|National Front]] when this group absorbed the Zwart Front in 1940.&lt;ref name="Rees2"/&gt; Officially a member of the NSNAP again he took little role in active politics and instead concentrated on his anti-Semitic writing and literary pursuits.&lt;ref name="Rees2"/&gt;

==Literature==
In 1938 Haighton purchased the literary journal ''[[De Nieuwe Gids]]'', a work that held a high reputation amongst the Dutch artistic set. Under Haighton however the once respected journal became intensely partisan, presenting a highly pro-[[Nazi Germany]] line.&lt;ref name="Dewulf"/&gt; Writers such as [[Jan Eekhout]], a staunchly pro-Nazi novelist noted for his use of archaic and dialect [[Dutch language|Dutch]] words as part of an attempt to construct rustic literature, were featured and widely praised under Haighton.&lt;ref&gt;Egil Törnqvist, ''Europe, The Nordic Countries'', Rodopi, 1998, pp. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch literary establishment reacted negatively to Haighton's stewardship of the magazine, to the point that by 1943 ''De Nieuwe Gids'' had only 98 registered subscribers.&lt;ref name="Dewulf"&gt;Jeroen Dewulf, ''Spirit of Resistance: Dutch Clandestine Literature During the Nazi Occupation'', Camden House, 2010, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Haighton died suddenly in [[Beekbergen]] that same year.&lt;ref name="Rees2"/&gt;

In 1991 he moved to [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sport.onet.pl/pilka-reczna/liga-mistrzow-pilkarzy-recznych/bertus-servaas-kolega-van-bastena-i-rijkaarda-zbudowal-europejska-potege-w-polsce/2zf42|title=Bertus Servaas - kolega Van Bastena i Rijkaarda zbudował europejską potęgę w Polsce|date=2013-09-25|work=Onet Sport|access-date=2017-12-13|language=pl-PL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through buy-out of 25% of shares, he became a co-owner of a small second-hand clothes wholesale, at the time located in Szczukowskie Górki. After a fire which burned down almost all goods and buildings during the night of 7 to 8 October 2002,, he rebuilt the company, moving it to [[Kielce]], to the halls previously owned by Chemar.

In 2002 he became the owner of Kolporter Kielce handball club (later renamed to Vive Kielce),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iskrakielce.pl/historia/|title=Historia|website=iskrakielce.pl|language=pl-PL|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; who since then (until 2017) have been the champions of Poland nine times, won 12 Polish Cups and won the 2015/2016 [[EHF Champions League|Champions League]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-13|title=2015–16 EHF Champions League|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2015%E2%80%9316_EHF_Champions_League&amp;oldid=805103557|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''business service provider''' ('''BSP''') is one of several categories of [[service provider]] in the business world. As opposed to an [[application service provider]] which provides application components over a [[computer network]], the services provided by a BSP are more in the area of infrastructure: mail delivery, building security, finance, administration, and human resources.{{sfn|Umar|2003|p=8&amp;mdash;15}}  Unlike an ASP, a BSP provides [[business process]]es as services, providing partial or full [[business process outsourcing]].{{sfn|Seidl|2007|p=14}}  They are often subdivided into two types: "back office" and "front office" BSPs.{{sfn|Seidl|2007|p=13}}

== Types of business service providers==

===Back Office BSPs===
[[Back office]] operations are the off-site delivery of a range of non-core service functions, including routine administration tasks, customer service and [[technical support]]. Offshore back office operations involve the ongoing use of an outsourcing base in another country.&lt;ref name="BOO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradeforum.org/Back-Office-Operations/ 
|title=Back Office Operations|publisher=Trade Forum|accessdate=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Front Office BSPs===
The [[front office]] is the part of a company that comes in contact with clients, such as the [[marketing department|marketing]], [[sales department|sales]], and [[service department]]s. In the hotel industry, the front office (also known as front desk) welcomes guests to the accommodation section: meeting and greeting them, taking and organizing reservations, allocating check in and out of rooms, organizing porter service, issuing keys and other security arrangements, passing on messages to customers and settling the accounts.&lt;ref name="The role of the service provider in the community"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psawa.com/The_role_of_the_service_provider_in_the_community.html#31b |title= The role of the service provider in the community|publisher=psawa.com |accessdate=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Castlefield Merchants 4699.JPG|thumb|Merchants' and Middle Warehouse, Castlefield]]
A '''canal warehouse''' is a commercial building principally associated with the expansions of canals from 1761 to 1896. This type of [[warehouse]] derived from coastal predecessors, had unique features: it had internal water filled canal arms that entered the building, it was multistorey with canal access at one level and road and even rail egress at another, and has a hoist system powered by a water wheel or at later stages steam. Canal warehouses were transhipment warehouses, holding goods until they could be shipped out to their next recipient.&lt;ref name=NW6&gt;{{Harvnb|Nevell|Walker|2001|p=6}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The first true canal warehouse was the Dukes Warehouse,&lt;ref name=NW6/&gt; at the [[Bridgewater Canal]] Basin in [[Castlefield]], [[Manchester]] built in 1761. It has been demolished, but two later warehouses at Castlefield have been restored.&lt;ref name=P-B320&gt;{{Harvnb|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later [[Portland Basin]] warehouse, was built in 1834 by the architect, [[David Bellhouse]]. It has three shipping arms, and continued to be used as a storage warehouse after its serving canal became disused.&lt;ref name=NW17&gt;{{Harvnb|Nevell|Walker|2001|pp=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Bellhouse, was responsible for designing the first railway warehouse at [[Liverpool Road railway station (Manchester)|Liverpool Road railway station]] in 1830, and the features of the canal warehouse were incorporated into a transhipment warehouse for this new form of transport.

The last canal warehouse was the [[The Great Northern Warehouse|Great Northern Railway Company Warehouse]] massive warehouse off Deansgate in Manchester. This was built in 1896 over the [[Manchester and Salford Junction Canal]], it had road access on two levels, rail lines entering on two levels and a transhipment floor of 26,730&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=NW14&gt;{{Harvnb|Nevell|Walker|2001|p=14}}

The use, procuring or offering of a child by others for illegal activities, including [[Drug trafficking|the trafficking]] or production of drugs, is one of the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention#Predefined worst forms of child labour|''predefined worst forms of child labour'']] in terms of the [[International Labour Organization]]'s [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]], adopted in 1999.

It is also known as '''Children used by adults in the commission of crime''' (CUBAC).

In terms of the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Recommendation]] ratifying countries should ensure that CUBAC is a criminal offence, and also provide for other criminal, civil or administrative remedies to ensure the effective enforcement of such national legislation (Article III(12) to (14)).

'''Consumer bankruptcy in Canada''' is governed by the ''Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act'' ("BIA").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. B-3) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/index.html | accessdate = September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation is complemented by regulations, as well as directives from the [[Superintendent of Bankruptcy|Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy]] that provide guidelines to trustees in [[bankruptcy]] on various aspects of the BIA.

==Consumer basic concepts ==

For the purposes of the BIA, it is important to be able to distinguish between legal definition of "[[Insolvency|insolvent]] person" and one of "bankrupt". Generally, an insolvent person is one who cannot pay his or her [[debt]]s and may subsequently become bankrupt, either by assigning himself into bankruptcy, being petitioned into bankruptcy by the [[creditor]]s, or being deemed to assign himself into bankruptcy by [[Default (finance)|defaulting]] on a Division I proposal.

The person who is unable to pay his obligation is considered to be an '''insolvent person''' under the BIA. Under s. 2 of the BIA, an "insolvent person" is a person who is not bankrupt and who resides, carries on business, or has property in Canada, whose liabilities to creditors provable as claims under this Act amount to $1,000, and

:(a) who is for any reason unable to meet his obligations as they generally become due,
:(b) the aggregate of whose property is not, at a fair valuation, sufficient, or, if disposed of at a fairly conducted sale under legal process, would not be sufficient to enable payment of all his obligations, due and accruing due.
&lt;br /&gt;
Insolvent consumers, according to the BIA, have three main options 
:# Declare bankruptcy; 
:# Submit a consumer proposal to creditors, Division II proposal; 
:# Submit a Division I proposal to creditors; 
The four main players involved in consumer insolvency are [http://www.ic.gc.ca/cgi-bin/sc_mrksv/bnkrptcy/trstSrch/qryTrst.cgi Licensed Insolvency Trustee], Debtor/insolvent person, Creditors, [http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/home Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy.]

Under s. 2 of the BIA, an "insolvent person" can become "'''bankrupt'''" for the purposes of the BIA in three ways:

*by a voluntary assignment in bankruptcy &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 49(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-12.html | accessdate = March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*an application for a bankruptcy order &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 43(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-10.html | accessdate = March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*by defaulting on a Division I Proposal &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 57 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-15.html | accessdate = March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bankruptcy process==

The bankruptcy process may be divided into three stages:

===Initiation of the bankruptcy process===
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Initiation of Bankruptcy Process, Bankruptcy Lawyers' Guide | url = http://lawyersbankruptcy.ca/go_bankrupt.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Where debts of an individual, excluding debts secured by the individual's principal residence, are not more than $250,000, an insolvent debtor may file a Consumer Proposal with his creditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alternatives to Bankruptcy. Consumer Proposal, Bankruptcy Lawyers Guide,http://www.lawyersbankruptcy.ca/consumer_proposal.html | url = http://lawyersbankruptcy.ca/consumer_proposal.html| accessdate = August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 66.12(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-38.html | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*For debt greater than this amount, a Division I Proposal can be filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 50(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-24.html | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Prior to filing a Proposal under Division I, the insolvent individual may file a notice of intention to stay the creditors so that a Division I proposal can be filed with the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy prior to the expiration of 30 days of the filing of the Notice of Intention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 50.4(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-25.html | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Filing a Proposal under Division I is a serious decision, because an insolvent person will be placed into bankruptcy if the proposal is voted down by the creditors or not approved by the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 42(1)(i) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-20.html | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*If the [http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/h_br01545.html#proposal Consumer Proposal] is not accepted by the creditors or the consumer proposal is not a viable option, an insolvent person may either voluntarily assign himself into bankruptcy &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 49(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-23.html#h-22 | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or be involuntarily petitioned into bankruptcy by his creditors &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 43(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-20.html#h-20 | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The legal proceedings and creditor's attempts to enforce the debts are stayed, no person is allowed to initiate or to continue existing legal actions against the bankrupt nor to enforce existing court orders (other than secured creditors who are allowed to enforce their security) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 69(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-49.html | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between bankruptcy and discharge===

The bankrupt must:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bankrupts' Duties, Bankruptcy Lawyers' Guide, http://www.lawyersbankruptcy.ca | url = http://lawyersbankruptcy.ca/bankruptcy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 158 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-84.html | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*deliver all his property, [[credit card]]s and records that are under his possession or control to the trustee
*attend before the official receiver (if requested to do so) for examination under oath with respect to his conduct, the causes of his bankruptcy and the disposition of his property
* prepare and submit to the trustee  a statement of the bankrupt's affairs in the prescribed form (also known as the Statement of Affairs)
* aid the trustee in making an inventory of his assets;
* disclose to the trustee all property disposed of within the previous year (including how, to whom and for how much) that was not in the normal course of business or for reasonable personal expenses
* disclose to the trustee all property given or settled without adequate valuable consideration within the previous five years
* attend the first meeting of his creditors, and, when required, attend other meetings of his creditors or of the inspectors, or attend on the trustee
* submit to such other examinations under oath with respect to his property or affairs as required
* aid to the utmost of his power in the realization of his property and the distribution of the proceeds among his creditors
* execute any documents that may be required
* examine the correctness of all proofs of claims filed, if required by the trustee
* in case any person has to his knowledge filed a false claim, disclose the fact immediately to the trustee
* inform the trustee of any material change in the bankrupt's financial situation
* generally do all such acts and things in relation to his property and the distribution of the proceeds among his creditors as may be reasonably required by the trustee, the bankruptcy rules, or by court order,and
* until his application for discharge has been disposed of and the administration of the estate completed, keep the trustee advised at all times of his place of residence or address.

A bankrupt must also remit to the trustee the amount of his income that is determined to be surplus to his needs, for the benefit of the estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 68 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-48.html | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Determination of property in the bankruptcy estate ====

Contributions made to [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan]]s (RRSPs), [[Registered Retirement Income Fund]]s (RRIFs), and Deferred Profit Sharing Plans (DPSPs) in the twelve months prior to the date of bankruptcy will be recovered for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 67(1)(b.3) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-47.html | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in provinces other than British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia (where they are exempt from seizure under applicable provincial legislation). The court can extend the one-year recovery period where it is considered appropriate.

===Period applicable until discharge===

The bankrupt may apply to court at any time for discharge from bankruptcy (provided he has fulfilled his duties), and the court may grant it, either fully or conditionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Absolute or Conditional Discharge, Bankruptcy Lawyers' Guide, http://www.lawyersbankruptcy.ca | url = http://lawyersbankruptcy.ca/bankruptcy_discharge.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 172 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-91.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of first-time or second-time bankrupts, discharge occurs automatically (provided they have attended counselling sessions arranged by the trustee)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 157.1 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-84.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|+ '''Automatically discharged (except where an opposition has been filed before it takes effect)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 168.1 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-88.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above does not apply to a bankrupt that has personal income tax debt of $200,000 or more, which represents 75% or more of total unsecured claims. In this case, a hearing for an application for discharge may not be held before the end of the applicable period below:

The following debts are not released on discharge:

* any fine, penalty, or restitution order imposed by a court in respect of an offence, or any debt arising out of a recognizance or bail
* any award of damages by a court in civil proceedings in respect of
** bodily harm intentionally inflicted, or sexual assault, or
** wrongful death resulting therefrom
* alimony or alimentary pension
* support or maintenance payments
* any debt or liability arising out of fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity (or, in the Province of Quebec, as a trustee or administrator of the property of others)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fraudulent Conveyances, Undue Preference, Badges of Fraud in Bankruptcy, http://lawyersbankruptcy.ca/defence_of_fraudulent_conveyances.html, Bankruptcy Lawyers' Guide, http://www.lawyersbankruptcy.ca | url = http://lawyersbankruptcy.ca/defence_of_fraudulent_conveyances.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* any debt or liability resulting from obtaining property or services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation (other than a debt or liability that arises from an equity claim)
* liability for the dividend that a creditor would have been entitled to receive on any provable claim not disclosed to the trustee (unless the creditor had notice or knowledge of the bankruptcy and failed to take reasonable action to prove his claim)
* student loans, where the date of bankruptcy occurred
** before the date on which the bankrupt ceased to be a full- or part-time student (as the case may be), or
** within seven years after the date on which the bankrupt ceased to be a full- or part-time student
* any accrued interest on any of the above&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 178(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-93.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of student loans, the seven-year period noted above, on application to the court, may be reduced to five years, if the court is satisfied:
* that the bankrupt has acted in good faith in the matter, and
* he is still experiencing financial difficulties, to the extent that he will be unable to pay the debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 178(1.1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-93.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and objectives of the bankruptcy process==

The purpose of the bankruptcy process is to introduce a legislative mechanism that would provide a fair and peaceful resolution of financial conflict between debtors and creditors, creditors competing among themselves for recovery of their loans and balance public interest in protecting financial security of creditors on one hand and public interest in allowing an insolvent individual to make a fresh start. Generally, the objectives of the bankruptcy process can be summarized as follows:

*To permit an honest, but unfortunate debtor to obtain a discharge of his debts and to make "fresh start";
*Not only to permit an honest debtor to make a fresh start, but also to rehabilitate such a debtor by counseling the bankrupt on managing his  financial affairs after discharge in order to prevent subsequent insolvency of the bankrupt;
*To promote a sense of commercial responsibility of the bankrupt and to deter bankrupt from subsequent insolvencies by introducing stricter legislative and judicial treatment of second and ensuing bankruptcies;
*To permit an investigation of the financial affairs of the bankrupt by a mediator, a trustee in bankruptcy, who is given broad powers to facilitate settlement of the claims by way of consumer proposal, to require compliance with bankruptcy procedures, to set aside fraudulent transactions and preferences among creditors and to adjudicate various matters under the BIA;
*To protect the creditors from competing with each other and to secure the debtor from excessive pressure from the creditors attempting to collect their debts first by introducing a priority of distribution of bankrupt's property scheme under which all creditors are treated equally in accordance with the scheme.

==Consequences of bankruptcy==

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
! scope="col" |  '''Positive consequences'''
! scope="col" |  '''Negative consequences'''
|- valign="top"
|
*Bankrupt is discharged from all or a significant part of the existing debts and is able to make a "fresh start"
*Creditors are not allowed to start new legal actions or to continue existing ones against the debtor or the third parties in possession of bankrupt's property
*Collection agencies are not allowed to enforce the debts, meaning the collection calls will stop
*Bankrupt is entitled to keep certain property exempted from distribution among the creditors
*Although the bankrupt gives up a part of his surplus income during the bankruptcy period, it is significantly less than the total payments required to his/her creditors prior to the bankruptcy
|
*Bankrupt gives up the legal title and control of non-exempt property
*Bankruptcy will be shown on bankrupt's credit rating for as long as seven years after discharge for a first bankruptcy and up to fourteen years on the second bankruptcy
*Bankrupt loses some professional and civil privileges, i.e. capacity to hold money in trust, capacity to be elected to certain civil positions
*Bankruptcy still carries negative stigma, i.e. negatively influence bankrupt's credibility in the credit granting community
*Bankrupt loses part of any surplus income and all property received before his discharge, and is transferred to trustee for distribution among creditors
*Debtor is deprived of a part of the income and the property and as a consequence may have to lower his and his family standards of living
*Debtor's contractors may suspend and cancel the services where there is a contractual ''ipso facto'' clause allowing contractors to cancel the contract on bankruptcy
*Bankrupt has limited contractual capacity, debtor's contracts are subject to a review by a trustee in bankruptcy
*Debts that are not dischargeable debts still have to be repaid even after a discharge order is made (i.e. fraud, child support)
*Bankrupt has duties to perform before the discharge, and, if the discharge is conditional, some duties to perform afterwards depending on the findings of the Court

'''Dalal Street''' ({{lang-hi|दलाल पथ}}, {{lang-gu|દલાલ સ્ટ્રીટ}}) in downtown [[Mumbai]], [[India]], is the address of the [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] (in the [[Phiroze Jeejeebhoy Towers]]) and several related financial firms and institutions. When Bombay Stock Exchange was moved to this new location at the intersection of [[Bombay Samachar|Bombay Samāchār]] Marg and Hammam Street, the street next to the building was renamed as ''Dalal Street''{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. The [[Marathi language|Marathi]] word ''{{transl|mr|dalāl}}'' means "a [[broker]]", "a go-between".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-864317-3| last = McGregor| first = R. S.| title = Oxford Hindi-English dictionary| location = Oxford| date = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to [[Wall Street]] in [[New York City|the New York City]], it is often used as a [[metonym]] for the entire Indian financial industry.

'''Emory Entrepreneurship &amp; Venture Management''' (EEVM) is a student-run organization dedicated to encouraging [[entrepreneurship]] and business development in the [[Atlanta, Georgia]] area.  EEVM was founded in 2012 by [[Emory University]] undergraduates. Today, EEVM members include Emory [[undergraduate]], [[Graduate school|graduate]], professional students, and faculty, as well as several hundred Emory alumni around the world.

== HackATL ==
HackATL is EEVM's annual three-day hackathon competition.  The event is open to all college students as well as working professionals. The inaugural HackATL event was held at the Goizueta Business School and had over 400 participants from 80 different universities.

== StartupCrunch ==
StartupCrunch is a monthly dinner event open to the Atlanta community focused on fostering the entrepreneurship community. The event has invited speakers from around the United States as well as provided an opportunity for local startups to pitch and receive advice.

== Emory Entrepreneurial Excellerator ==
Founded in 2014 by Nihar Parikh, the Emory Entrepreneurial Excellerator is designed to coax talent and results out of Emory’s entrepreneurial community. The program takes Emory-founded startups from conception to the initial pitch phase, and culminates with the companies in the program pitching to Atlanta venture capital firms. The program will help Emory and The Goizueta Business School establish themselves as a force in the South’s vibrant startup community.

The pre-accelerator has three components to it: Work sessions, a speaking series and a mentoring program.

=== Work Sessions ===
A primary component of the program is ensuring the startups maintain a consistent work schedule so they can accomplish their goals in a timely fashion. Work sessions will feature resources including computer lab type rooms work rooms, either in the library or the business school, resource materials compiled by EEVM only available during work sessions, and an EEVM mentor present to mediate the meeting as well as offer basic suggestions. Teams will be required to submit deliverables on specific topics after each work sessions. 

=== Speaker Series ===
EEVM will bring in speakers twice a month, prioritizing startup veterans or members of other incubators like Hypepotamus, ATDC, Tech Village, etc. Topics will focus on early stage startup development, including but not limited to determining market potential, assigning roles, and incorporating and other legal advice. 

=== Mentor Open Hours ===
Goizueta professors and faculty members will be available for limited periods every week for guidance. Startups can use these resources to test ideas on more experienced individuals as well as ask for guidance on specific technical topics, such as market research techniques and financial modeling. To best utilize mentor schedules, startups must ask for an appointment with the mentor and come prepared with a problem statement.

[[Image:EXPOMINER Entrada.jpg|right | 200px | The main entrance of the Fair]]'''Expominer''' is a [[mineral]], [[fossil]] and [[jewelry]] exhibition, that is held every year in November in the pavilions of the Fira de Barcelona (Barcelona Fairs and Congresses).

During the three-day show there are exhibitions and conferences. Every year Expominer takes place in the city of [[Barcelona]] (in the Montjuïc Exhibition Center) next to the famous [[Montjuïc]] [[Magic Fountain of Montjuïc|Monumental Fountains]], at the foot of the Catalonia National Art Museum ([[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]]), towards the month of November (usually after the Munich mineral Show - [[Mineralientage]].

Expominer started in 1979 in the main pavilions of the Fira de Barcelona, but was then moved to a discreet metal hangar, next to the Montjuïc Monumental Fountains. A few years ago{{When|date=April 2011}}, because of the popularity that this show has acquired, the Mineral Show moved to one of the so-called 'noble' pavilions Palace No. 5, and then in recent{{When|date=April 2011}} years it has been moved again to one of the best Exhibition Centers, Palace No. 6.

Every year, over 14,000 visitors, including mineral and fossil collectors, students and enthusiasts, visit the stands of more than 140 exhibitors who come from various countries. There are also exhibitions, workshops on minerals and conferences. Over the years, the number of exhibitors has increased dramatically, as has the number of visitors and, although still small in scale (which is in line with the hobby of collecting minerals in Spain), we{{Who|date=April 2011}} can say that Expominer has become the official Spanish Mineral Show. It is heir to the great collector Mr. [[The Folch Mineral Collection (Barcelona, Spain)|Joaquín Folch i Girona]] and, with the collaboration of the Grup Mineralògic Català, it has become key for mineral fans in both Catalonia and Spain.

'''Fernando Jarquín Pira''' (Guatemala City, February 1, 1965) is a Guatemalan entrepreneur and leader in the pharmaceutical industry of Central America’s northern triangle ([[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], and [[Honduras]]). Jarquín is a shareholder of Agencia Farmacéutica Internacional, S.A. (AGEFINSA) and Iberfarma, S.A., two of the most important pharmaceutical distributors in Guatemala.

== Early life ==
Fernando Jarquín is the son of Roberto Jarquín Richeme and Isabel Pira Arrivillaga. He spent his childhood between Guatemala City and the city of [[Tecpán Guatemala|Técpan]], [[Chimaltenango]]. His ancestors established themselves in Técpan at the end of the 19th century. In 1983, Jarquín graduated from high school at Marist School Liceo Guatemala, a private Catholic school located in [[Guatemala City]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://latinbusinessdaily.com/stories/511389740-guatemalan-pharmaceutical-distributor-celebrating-21st-year|title=Guatemalan Pharmaceutical Distributor Celebrating 21st Year|last=|first=|date=2017-04-13|work=Latin Business Daily|access-date=2018-04-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jarquín had an interest in business, so he studied international commerce and marketing at the [[Rafael Landívar University|Universidad Rafael Landívar]]. During his college years, Jarquín worked as a sales representative for several companies in the international commerce space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When he was 19 years old, in 1984, he started to work as a sales representative for Concorde Line, a shipping company.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://latinbusinessdaily.com/stories/511372065-fernando-jarquin-guatemala-s-pharmaceutical-innovator-and-entrepreneur-talks-business|title=Fernando Jarquin, Guatemala’s Pharmaceutical Innovator and Entrepreneur, Talks Business|last=|first=|date=2017-03-28|work=Latin Business Daily|access-date=2018-04-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business career ==

=== Pharmaceutical industry ===
Jarquín began his post-college career in the pharmaceutical industry. He began by working for the Swiss company Sandoz-Wander (now known as [[Novartis|Novartis Group]]) in 1987.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to his expertise in the industry, in 1995 Jarquín founded Agencia Farmacéutica Internacional, S.A. (AGEFINSA), a pharmaceutical distribution company that sells pharmaceutical products in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. AGEFINSA represents several of the largest European pharmaceutical laboratories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a news interview, he described AGEFINSA: "The company has a complete range of pharmaceutical products from recognized pharmaceutical companies worldwide. We also distribute “orphan” products, meaning products needed in the market but which lack a local representative. Thus, we cover a need to improve the quality of life of patients."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1996, Jarquín founded Iberfarma, S.A., his second pharmaceutical company, to distribute pharmaceutical products to private hospitals and drug stores, reaching a different market segment than the recently created AGEFINSA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Dairy industry and byproducts ===
Jarquín’s dairy and byproducts businesses are centered around Productos Valparaíso, S.A., a company located in the territorial division of [[Alta Verapaz Department|Alta Verapaz]], Guatemala, in a farm which runs under the name “Finca Valparaiso”; and the ranch FJ Chichavac, located in the Municipality of Tecpán, in the department of Chimaltenango. Productos Valparaíso produces Jersey cow milk, goat milk, and various types of yogurt and cheese.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://flbusinessdaily.com/stories/511393699-entrepreneur-branches-out-beyond-pharmaceuticals|title=Entrepreneur branches out beyond pharmaceuticals|last=|first=|date=2017-12-03|work=Florida Business Daily|access-date=2018-04-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jarquín is also connected to MilkSource Genetics, a U.S. milk producer that sells its products in Wisconsin, Michigan and Missouri. He is also the co-owner of the cow “Musquie latola Martha”, a three time winner at the [[Royal Agricultural Winter Fair]], which takes place ever year in Toronto, Canada.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Wine industry ===
In 2002, Jarquín ventured into the wine import and distribution industry after he bought the company La Cofradía de los Vinos, a high end wine distributing company of brands such as Cousiño Macul (Chile), Luigi Bosca, Salentein and Pulenta (Argentina), and Pisco Cuatro Gallos (Peru).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The company serves the emerging Guatemalan wine market and is focused on high-level winery. It sells a few brands in supermarkets. The most exclusive brands of its portfolio are sold in Guatemala City’s top restaurants, and in certain places in the city of Antigua, Guatemala.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== K´abel Business Center ===
In 2013, Jarquín opened the Centro de Convenciones K´abel (Kabel, S.A., commercial name “K´abel”), a business-oriented convention center that integrates meeting and conference rooms. Originally, the center hosted mostly medical institutions, physicians and pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Due to the success of the business, in 2015 the company changed its commercial name to K’abel Business Center. Currently, the company services private companies of diverse sectors and industries, and business chambers such as the [[United States Chamber of Commerce|American Chamber of Commerce]] (AMCHAM).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The executive chef of K’abel Business Center is Diego Jarquin, a graduate from [[Le Cordon Bleu]] Peru.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Equine breeding ===
Jarquín also owns FJ Chichavac Ranch, which is a member of the National Association of Breeders and Owners of Peruvian Paso Horses (ANCPCPP).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The ranch is located in [[Tecpán Guatemala|Tecpan]], Chimaltenango, Guatemala. Jarquín has been acknowledged for his accomplishments in breeding and genetic development of stallions, especially from Peru. His horses have been prized many times in contests organized by the ANCPCPP.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
Jarquín and his company Productos Valparaíso, through their corporate social responsibility program, are helping school children from neighboring communities to continue with their education. The purpose behind the program is to develop future leaders who will help continue economic development in the region after they graduate.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://latinbusinessdaily.com/stories/511453367-guatemalan-businessman-fernando-jarquin-implements-vision-for-development|title=Guatemalan businessman Fernando Jarquín implements vision for development|last=|first=|date=2018-06-04|work=Latin Business Daily|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the company helped rebuild the Escuela Oficial Rural Mixta (Mixed Rural Official School), located in the Chuparral 1 Village, in the department of Chimaltenango. The school was destroyed eight years ago by the Agatha storm.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4506">'''Fixed assets management''' is an [[accounting]] process that seeks to track [[fixed asset]]s for the purposes of [[financial accounting]], [[preventive maintenance]], and [[theft]] deterrence.

Organizations face a significant challenge to track the location, quantity, condition, maintenance and [[depreciation]] status of their fixed assets.  A popular approach to tracking fixed assets uses serial numbered asset tags, which are [[labels]] often with [[bar codes]] for easy and accurate reading. The owner of the assets can take inventory with a mobile [[bar code scanner|bar code reader]] and then produce a report.

Off-the-shelf software packages for fixed asset management are marketed to businesses small and large.  Some [[enterprise resource planning]] systems are available with fixed assets modules.

Some tracking methods automate the process, such as by using fixed scanners to read bar codes on [[railway]] [[freight car]]s or by attaching a [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) tag to an asset.

==Fixed asset tracking software==

Tracking assets is an important concern of every company, regardless of size. Fixed assets are defined as any 'permanent' object that a business uses internally including but not limited to computers, tools, software, or office equipment. While employees may use a specific tool or tools, the asset ultimately belongs to the company and must be returned. And therefore without an accurate method of keeping track of these assets it would be very easy for a company to lose control of them.

With advancements in technology, asset tracking software is now available that will help any size business track valuable assets such as equipment and supplies. According to a study issued in December, 2005 by the ARC Advisory Group, the worldwide market for enterprise asset management (EAM) was then at an estimated $2.2 billion and was expected to grow at about 5.0 percent per year reaching $2.8 billion in 2010.
[[File:Location-based asset management.png|alt=location-based asset tracking|center|700x700px|Fixed Asset Tracking across multiple locations|thumb]]

Asset tracking software allows companies to track what assets it owns, where each is located, who has it, when it was checked out, when it is due for return, when it is scheduled for maintenance, and the cost and depreciation of each asset.  

The reporting option that is built into most asset tracking solutions provides pre-built reports, including assets by category and department, check-in/check-out, net book value of assets, assets past due, audit history, and transactions.

All of this information is captured in one program and can be used on PCs as well as mobile devices. As a result, companies reduce expenses through loss prevention and improved equipment maintenance. They reduce new and unnecessary equipment purchases, and they can more accurately calculate taxes based on depreciation schedules.

The most commonly tracked assets are:

* Plant and equipment 
* Buildings
* Fixtures and fittings
* Long term investment
* Machinery
* Vehicles and heavy equipments
Asset tracking software is often used to track both the information about an asset for financial reporting purposes as well as the physical location of an asset. The financial reporting elements of tracking often relate to accounting procedures and valuation needs but may or may not relate to location information.

Asset location tracking software often takes one of two approaches to monitoring asset locations. The first approach is to use a physical tracking device to provide data on physical location. This can take the form of a [[Bluetooth low energy beacon|Bluetooth tracking beacon]] or a [[GPS tracking unit]]. The second approach is to track a location by the "responsible party". In this approach the software uses peer to peer assign and accept procedures to allow individuals to accept responsibility for assets. The asset location is then inferred based upon the person who has accepted responsibility.

== Mission and Role ==
The mission of GRLI "to catalyze the development of globally responsible leadership and practice worldwide" is in line with the view promoted by GRLI that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grli.org/resources/grli-brief/|title=GRLI In Brief|publisher=GRLI|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The management challenge for the 21st Century is to create resilient societies, [[Sustainability|sustainable]] economies and a healthy environment in which all human beings can flourish and prosper. This calls for individual and collective [[leadership]] that strives not to be the best in the world but the best for the world."

The GRLI aims at building a world where leaders contribute to the creation of economic and societal progress in a globally responsible and sustainable way. A starting point for global leadership includes, according to GRLI, fairness, freedom, honesty, humanity, tolerance, transparency, responsibility and solidarity, and sustainability.&lt;ref name="RascheKell2010-p177"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andreas Rasche|author2=Georg Kell|title=The United Nations Global Compact: Achievements, Trends and Challenges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5jxlPRKnh3AC&amp;pg=PA177|date=16 June 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-14553-4|pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered a resource for [[business education]] for cultivating leadership [[integrity]],&lt;ref name="Chandler2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert C.

It also cooperates with institutions of [[higher education]] to further develop their curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/programs/globally-responsible-leadership-initiative|title=Globally Responsible Leadership Initiative|publisher=Berkeley Center for Religion, Peace &amp; World Affairs|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative has catalysed the creation of two new academic journals: the ''Journal of Global Responsibility'' and the ''Sustainability, Accounting, Management and Policy Journal''.&lt;ref name="linkedin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/products/journals/affiliates.htm?id=jgr|title=Journal of Global Responsibility|publisher=[[Emerald Group Publishing]]|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/products/journals/affiliates.htm?id=sampj|title=Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GRLI, in partnership with ''Principles for Responsible Management Education'' (PRME) and other networks, has given rise to several projects including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grli.org/2016/10/04/sp-agreement/|title=Leading global networks initiate Collaboratory for responsible management education|publisher=GRLI|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The GRLI was founded in 2004 by the [[European Foundation for Management Development]] and the [[United Nations Global Compact]].&lt;ref name="linkedin"/&gt; The initiative's 2005 founding report identified a need for deep systemic change in business, recognizing that this change "needed to take place at the personal, organizational and systemic levels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grli.org/resources/globally-responsible-leadership-call-engagement/|title=Globally Responsible Leadership – A call for engagement|publisher=GRLI|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded with the  purpose of developing a next generation of globally responsible leaders through the development and support of projects and initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grli.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GRLI-Call-for-Action-English-2009-ISBN-978-1-871992-53-3.pdf The Globally Responsible Leader.

Haroon has demanded the establishment of a town on the outskirts of [[Karachi]] and proposed that it be named after late [[Benazir Bhutto]]. His suggestion was that up to six million people from the interior [[Sindh]] be settled there.&lt;ref name="The News"/&gt; He was also part of the protest against real estate development in [[Bundal Island]] by UAE-based [[Emaar Properties]]. Haroon is also known to have ably advocated the Sindh case against the [[Kalabagh Dam]].&lt;ref name="The News"/&gt;

In 2017, he had become disillusioned with his former political party's leadership, [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] and was leaving himself open to negotiations to join other Pakistani political parties and also left open the possibility for himself of contesting for a position in the upcoming general elections in Pakistan in 2018.&lt;ref name=DailyPakistan&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/9960/hussain-haroon-joins-anti-ppp-forces-in-larkana/ |date=24 May 2017|author=Jamal Dawoodpoto|title=Hussain Haroon joins anti-PPP forces in Larkana|publisher=Daily Times (newspaper)|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, Hussain Haroon was appointed as the Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the [[United Nations]], replacing veteran [[Munir Akram]].&lt;ref name=Dawn&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/317858 |date=23 August 2008|title=Hussain Haroon's appointment announced|publisher=Dawn (newspaper)|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment was controversial because Haroon had no prior experience in the Pakistan Foreign Service or international diplomacy. He took over the post on 3 September 2008.

'''Indian Accounting Standard '''(abbreviated as '''Ind-AS''') is the [[Accounting standard]] adopted by companies in India and issued under the supervison of Accounting Standards Board (ASB) which was constituted as a body in the year 1977. ASB is a committee under [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India]] (ICAI) which consists of representatives from government department, academicians, other professional bodies viz. ICAI, representatives from ASSOCHAM, CII, FICCI, etc.

The Ind AS are named and numbered in the same way as the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS). [[National Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards]] (NACAS) recommend these standards to the [[Ministry of Corporate Affairs (India)|Ministry of Corporate Affairs]] (MCA). MCA has to spell out the accounting standards applicable for companies in India. As on date MCA has notified 41 Ind AS. This shall be applied to the companies of financial year 2015-16 voluntarily and from 2016-17 on a mandatory basis.

Based on the international consensus, the regulators will separately notify the date of implementation of Ind-AS for the banks, insurance companies etc. Standards for the computation of Tax has been notified as ICDS in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Accounting Standards Converged with IFRS Notified|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=70248|publisher=Press Information Bureau }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan Bredack.jpg|thumb|Jan Bredack, 2014]]
'''Jan Bredack''' (born 24 April 1972 in [[Salzwedel]]/[[Germany]]) is a German entrepreneur. He is the founder and CEO of [[Veganz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Veganz - Wir lieben Leben|url = http://www.veganz.de|website = www.veganz.de|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a German wholesaler and supermarket chain for [[Plant-based diet|plant-based]] products.

Bredack was born on 9 April 1972 in Salzwedel, a small town in East Germany. As soon as he finished college, he began to skyrocket in the automotive industry. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, he started working within the [[Daimler AG|Daimler Group]], and was tasked with setting up the customer service function within the truck division. In conjunction with the [[Daimler AG|Daimler Group]], he completed an MBA at one of the top business schools in Continental Europe, the [[University of St. Gallen]] (Switzerland). He was then promoted to be Head of Sales and Service for Commercial Vehicles in Germany and managed over 24,000 employees. At the time, he was only 30 years old. Among other things, he established the first Russian commercial vehicle plant and he set up the local sales organization for the group in Tatarstan.

In 2008, the stress got the best of him and Jan came to the realization that he had to make some radical changes in his life  He became vegan and in the spring of 2011 he founded [[Veganz]], a vegan wholesaler with its own chain of grocery stores.

Why the German entrepreneur founded [[Veganz]], he explained in an interview with Organic&amp;Wellness News in the fall 2015: "In 2008 I had a burn-out and took some time off. Then I feel in love with a woman who was a vegetarian, so I tried out the vegetarian lifestyle and soon afterwards became a vegan. Back then it was difficult finding vegan foods and I stood in the grocery store wondering which products I could actually buy - and that is when I hit upon the idea of opening a vegan supermarket! We found a suitable location in Berlin, found investors, staff and products and in early 2011 I opened the first Veganz store in Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg neighbourhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Veganz: at full steam {{!}} Organic and Wellness News|url = http://organicwellnessnews.com/en/veganz-at-full-steam/|website = organicwellnessnews.com|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In six German cities, in addition to Prague and Vienna, the company offers  vegan food. With its wholesale department, [[Veganz]] is by far the largest distributor of vegan products within the entire German market.

In 2014, the company was as a finalist for the  German Entrepreneur Of the Year Award. At the end of the 2014, Jan was elected to the Person of the Year by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] Germany.

Joy's divorced parents fight whenever her father, Rudy, shows up at her house. Joy's older half-sister, Peggy, is an [[overachievement|overachiever]] who constantly humiliates Joy in front of her children for her failed marriage. Peggy and Rudy are very close, and Terri spends all day in bed watching [[soap opera]]s, leaving Joy to run the household. Only Mimi, and Joy's best friend, Jackie, encourage her to pursue her inventing ambitions.

After divorcing his third wife, Joy's father starts dating Trudy, a wealthy Italian widow with some business experience. After cutting her hands while mopping up spilled wine and broken glass, Joy decides to create a [[Joy Mangano#Miracle Mop|self-wringing mop]]. With help from her father's employees, she builds a prototype. Trudy agrees to invest in Joy's product and they contract with a company in [[California]], owned by a man in [[Dallas]], to manufacture the mop's parts at a low price. In order to avoid a potential patent lawsuit, Joy also pays $50,000 in royalties to a man in [[Hong Kong]] who supposedly has a similar product. When the company repeatedly bills Joy for their faulty parts, Joy tells her father, Trudy, and Peggy not to pay them.

Joy needs a quick, easy way to advertise her product, and is able to meet with [[QVC]] executive Neil Walker, with the help of Tony, who despite being divorced from Joy, remains close with her. Neil is impressed and shows Joy his infomercials, where celebrities sell entrepreneurs' products through a [[telethon]] system. Neil tells Joy to manufacture 50,000 mops. Joy is advised by Rudy and Trudy to take out a second mortgage on her home, in order to pay her costs. The first infomercial fails, due to the celebrity Neil chosen to advertise the product having no clue how the mop works properly, but the next day she goes straight to QVC and convinces Neil to let her do the infomercial. Once the second infomercial is done, Joy and her product become an overnight success. Things look up for the family, with the mop earning thousands of dollars on QVC, and Terri falls for Toussaint, a [[Haiti]]an plumber Joy hired to fix a leak in Terri's bedroom, something Terri has not done since her divorce with Rudy and other than watching her soap operas.

Joy's grandmother dies suddenly, after the running success. Rudy and Trudy send Peggy to California to conduct Joy's company business. Afterwards Peggy tells Joy that she paid the excessively raised production fees, despite Joy telling them not to pay them. She now claims to Joy that she and Rudy have a product of their own to send to QVC which they believe will be better than Joy's. Joy is angry and travels to California to meet with the manufacturer, who refuses to pay her back. Joy discovers that the manufacturer is about to fraudulently patent her design and claim that they were the ones who originally created the mop. Trudy's lawyer reveals that there is nothing they can do to prevent this, since Peggy paid the excessive fees and Joy is forced to file for [[bankruptcy]]. Joy discovers that the manufacturers have been defrauding her the entire time she has dealt with them. Upon learning this, she travels to Dallas to confront the owner, Derek Markham.  She reveals to Markham that she made a call to the man she supposedly paid the royalties to in Hong Kong, to explain about the product, but that he told Joy that he had no knowledge of the mop being made or of any royalties being paid, proving that Markham and the manufacturing company are committing fraud and embezzlement, which forces Markham to pay Joy back.

Several years later, Joy is a wealthy, successful businesswoman who helps other young inventors develop their ideas. Jackie and Tony remain her most valued advisors. Joy continues to take care of her father, despite him and Peggy having unsuccessfully and wrongly tried to sue her for ownership of her company. Terri is the only family member who does not live off Joy, finally finding stability through her relationship with Toussaint; and as Neil had predicted, he and Joy became "Adversaries in Commerce," with her move to HSN, but they remained personal friends.

{{For|John Dewey's theory of education|Learning-by-doing}}

'''Learning-by-doing''' is a [[concept]] in [[economic theory]] by which [[productivity]] is achieved through practice, self-perfection and minor [[innovation]]s.  An example is a factory that increases output by learning how to use equipment better without adding workers or investing significant amounts of capital.

The concept of learning-by-doing has been used by [[Kenneth Arrow]] in his design of [[endogenous growth theory]] to explain effects of innovation and technical change. [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]] (1988) adopted the concept to explain increasing returns to embodied human capital. Yang and Borland (1991) have shown learning-by-doing plays a role in the evolution of countries to greater specialisation in production. In both these cases, learning-by-doing and increasing returns provide an engine for long run growth.

Recently, it has become a popular explaining concept in the [[evolutionary economics]] and [[Resource-based view|resource-based view (RBV)]] of the [[:wikt:firm|firm]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

The [[Toyota Production System]] is known for [[Kaizen]], that is explicitly built upon learning-by-doing effects.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

[[File:217002 1023844644383 9898 n.jpg|alt=Lino Ieluzzi with his dog Dudley|thumb|Lino Ieluzzi with his dog Dudley]]

'''Pasquale Ieluzzi''' Comm. (October 7, 19??), better known by his nickname '''Lino Ieluzzi''', is an influential menswear icon from [[Milan]], [[Italy]].
He is the owner of the haberdashery 'Al Bazar di Lino Ieluzzi' in which he has been working since the 1970s. As interest in menswear spiked Ieluzzi has become more and more famous among men's style enthusiasts.

==Early life==
Lino has been interested in menswear since an early age. His interest was sparked by his father, whom he recalls as a man who was always impeccably dressed in [[Tailoring|well-tailored]] suits. Pictures of Ieluzzi as a 15-year old wearing a [[bandana]] with a [[sports jacket]] show early signs of his rule-bending when it comes to menswear.

==Personal style==
Ieluzzi has a very distinctive personal style, which is one of the reasons he has become very well known among menswear aficionados. He tends to wear a [[double breasted]] jacket in a bold colour and/or pattern, often with a different pair of pants underneath. The jacket is rather different to a 'normal' double-breasted jacket, in that Lino has reworked his jackets to also look good with [[denim]] and a [[polo neck]]. He couples this with a [[Collar (clothing)#Collar styles|cutaway collar]] shirt and a [[Necktie|tie]] with the number seven on it. To top it all off he wears a western-style belt, a silver keychain, either a [[Patek Philippe]] or [[Audemars Piguet]] watch and a pair of double [[monkstrap]] shoes with the second buckle unbuckled (one of his signature style moves). The distinctive number seven tie started as a bit of a joke to celebrate his birthday on October 7 but the ties caught on with his fans and they are now his bestseller product. He is a big fan of the colours blue, grey and cream, thus these often feature in his outfits.

==Al Bazar di Lino Ieluzzi==
Lino has been involved with Al Bazar since at least the 1970s, when he was an employee. At this point, it was still a store selling mainly denim. At some point Lino took over the store and started to change its market, wanting the store to challenge famous haberdasheries like M. Bardelli, which was at that time the place to be for wealthy young men to buy their suits. He started to go out a lot, to famous Milanese clubs like Nepentha and Charlie Max, so as to get to know his proposed customers. Seeing as people still dressed up to go out in these days, this necessitated the need for smart clothing. This is why Lino started carrying jackets and popovers in his store. Through the years, this slowly shifted into the present-day offerings of the store, consisting solely of items Lino likes and wears himself. He has been quoted with saying 'We can't be appreciated by everyone. Hence it is useless to make a product hoping that everyone will enjoy it. It is almost impossible. For this reason, I sell what I like and wear everyday.' This philosophy is well reflected in Al Bazar.

==Rise to Fame==
Ieluzzi has been a longtime attendee of the menswear show [[Pitti Uomo]], which is organised in [[Florence]] every January and June. Along with the larger interest in menswear, more people started to attend this show. One of them was [[Scott Schuman]] from 'The Sartorialist', who photographed him there and wrote a couple of articles on him, instantly making Ieluzzi known in men's fashion circles around the world.

==Personal life==
Not much is known about Ieluzzi's personal life, because he keeps it mostly private. However, we do know that he was married for a few years, that he has a daughter and he's currently single. He had a black Labrador, Dudley, who appeared with him in several magazines. Today he has a blond Labrador, Tommy, to which he appears to be very close and who appears on Lino's social media channels very often.

The study of management information systems examines people and technology in an organizational context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Management Information Systems?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509003228/http://mays.tamu.edu/info/what-is-mis/|archivedate=May 9, 2015|url=http://mays.tamu.edu/info/what-is-mis/|publisher=Mays Business School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a corporate setting, the ultimate goal of the use of a management information system is to increase the value and profits of the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.umassd.edu/charlton/programs/mis/|title=Management Information Systems|publisher=[[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]] |website=umassd.edu |access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
While it can be contested that the history of management information systems date as far back as companies using ledgers to keep track of accounting, the modern history of MIS can be divided into five ''eras'' originally identified by [[Kenneth C. Laudon]] and Jane Laudon in their seminal textbook ''Management Information Systems.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Management Information Systems: Managing the Digital Firm|last1=Laudon|first1=Kenneth C.|last2=Laudon|first2=Jane P.|publisher=Prentice Hall/CourseSmart|year=2009|edition=11|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bizfluent.com/about-5444925-history-management-information-systems.html|title=The History of Management Information Systems|last=Boykin|first=George|date=2017-09-26|website=bizfluent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* First Era – [[Mainframe]] and [[minicomputer]] computing
* Second Era – [[Personal computer]]s
* Third Era – [[Client/server]] networks
* Fourth Era – [[Enterprise computing]] 
* Fifth Era – [[Cloud computing]]

The ''first era'' (mainframe and minicomputer computing) was ruled by [[IBM]] and their mainframe computers for which they supplied both the hardware and software. These computers would often take up whole rooms and require teams to run them. As technology advanced, these computers were able to handle greater capacities and therefore reduce their cost. Smaller, more affordable minicomputers allowed larger businesses to run their own computing centers in-house / on-site / on-premises.

The ''second era'' (personal computers) began in 1965 as microprocessors started to compete with mainframes and minicomputers and accelerated the process of decentralizing computing power from large data centers to smaller offices. In the late 1970s, minicomputer technology gave way to personal computers and relatively low-cost computers were becoming mass market commodities, allowing businesses to provide their employees access to computing power that ten years before would have cost tens of thousands of dollars. This proliferation of computers created a ready market for interconnecting networks and the popularization of the Internet. (The first microprocessor — a four-bit device intended for a programmable calculator — was introduced in 1971 and microprocessor-based systems were not readily available for several years. The MITS Altair 8800 was the first commonly known microprocessor-based system, followed closely by the Apple I and II.  It is arguable that the microprocessor-based system did not make significant inroads into minicomputer use until 1979, when [[VisiCalc]] prompted record sales of the Apple II on which it ran. The IBM PC introduced in 1981 was more broadly palatable to business, but its limitations gated its ability to challenge minicomputer systems until perhaps the late 1980s to early 1990s.)

The ''third era'' (client/server networks) arose as technological complexity increased, costs decreased, and the end-user (now the ordinary employee) required a system to [[Information sharing|share information]] with other employees within an enterprise. Computers on a common network shared information on a server. This lets thousands and even millions of people access data simultaneously on networks referred to as [[Intranet|Intranets]]. 

The ''fourth era'' (enterprise computing) enabled by high speed networks, consolidated the original department specific software applications into integrated software platforms referred to as [[enterprise software]]. This new platform tied all aspects of the business enterprise together offering rich information access encompassing the complete management structure.

The ''fifth era'' (cloud computing) is the latest and employs networking technology to deliver applications as well as data storage independent of the configuration, location, or nature of the hardware. This, along with high speed [[cellphone]] and [[Wi-Fi]] networks, has led to new levels of mobility in which managers may access the MIS remotely with [[laptop]]s, [[tablet computers]] and [[smartphones]].

== Terminology ==
The terms management information systems (MIS), [[information system|information system (IS)]] , [[enterprise resource planning|enterprise resource planning (ERP)]], [[computer science]], [[Computer engineering|electrical computer engineering]], and [[information technology management]] (IT) are often confused. MIS is a hierarchical subset of information systems. MIS are more organization-focused narrowing in on leveraging information technology to increase business value. Computer science is more software-focused dealing with the applications that may be used in MIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mis.eller.arizona.edu/what-is-mis|title=What is MIS?|last=The University of Arizona|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical computer engineering is product-focused mainly dealing with the architecture behind computer systems. ERP software is a subset of MIS and IT management refers to the technical management of an IT department which may include MIS.

== Management ==
While management information systems can be used by any and every level of management, the decision of which systems to implement generally falls upon the [[chief information officer]]s (CIO) and [[chief technology officer]]s (CTO). These officers are generally responsible for the overall technology strategy of an organization including evaluating how new technology can help their organization. They act as decision makers in the implementation process of new MIS.

Once decisions have been made, IT directors, including MIS directors, are in charge of the technical implementation of the system. They are also in charge of implementing the policies affecting the MIS (either new specific policies passed down by the CIOs or CTOs or policies that align the new systems with the organizations overall IT policy). It is also their role to ensure the availability of data and network services as well as the security of the data involved by coordinating IT activities.

Upon implementation, the assigned users will have the appropriate access to relevant information. It is important to note that not everyone inputting data into MIS need necessarily be management level. It is common practice to have inputs to MIS be inputted by non-managerial employees though they rarely have access to the reports and decision support platforms offered by these systems.

== Types ==
The following are types of information systems used to create reports, extract data, and assist in the decision making processes of middle and operational level managers.

* [[Decision support system|Decision support systems (DSS)]] are computer program applications used by middle and higher management to compile information from a wide range of sources to support problem solving and decision making. A DSS is used mostly for semi-structured and unstructured decision problems. 
* [[Executive information system|Executive information systems (EIS)]] is a reporting tool that provides quick access to summarized reports coming from all company levels and departments such as accounting, human resources and operations.
* [[Marketing Information System|Marketing information system]]s are management Information Systems designed specifically for managing the [[marketing]] aspects of the business.
*[[Accounting information system]]s are focused [[accounting]] functions. 
*[[Human resource management system]]s are used for personnel aspects. 
* [[Office automation|Office automation systems (OAS)]] support communication and productivity in the enterprise by automating [[workflow]] and eliminating bottlenecks. OAS may be implemented at any and all levels of management.

== Advantages ==
The following are some of the benefits that can be attained using MIS:&lt;ref&gt; (1995), Strategic Information Systems Planning: A Review, Information Resources Management Association International Conference, May 21–24, Atlanta.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Companies are able to identify their strengths and weaknesses due to the presence of revenue reports, employees' performance record etc. Identifying these aspects can help a company improve its business processes and operations.
* Giving an overall picture of the company. 
* Acting as a communication and planning tool.
* The availability of customer data and feedback can help the company to align its [[business process]]es according to the needs of its customers. The effective management of customer data can help the company to perform direct marketing and promotion activities.
*MIS can help a company gain a [[competitive advantage]].
*MIS reports can help with decision-making as well as reduce downtime for actionable items.

== Enterprise applications ==
* ''Enterprise systems''—also known as ''[[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP)'' systems—provide integrated software modules and a unified database that personnel use to plan, manage, and control core business processes across multiple locations. Modules of ERP systems may include finance, accounting, marketing, human resources, production, inventory management, and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costa | first1 = A | last2 = Ferreira | first2 = C. | last3 = Bento | first3 = E. | last4 = Aparicio | first4 = F. | year = 2016 | title = Enterprise resource planning adoption and satisfaction determinants | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 659–671 | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2016.05.090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Supply chain management]] (SCM)'' systems enable more efficient management of the supply chain by integrating the links in a supply chain. This may include suppliers, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and final customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Victoria|title=Supply Chain Management: The Next Big Thing?|url=http://www.businessweek.com/business-schools/supply-chain-management-the-next-big-thing-09122011.html|work=Sept. 12, 2011|publisher=Business Week|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13239">{{Marketing}}'''Mass marketing''' is a market strategy in which a firm decides to ignore market segment differences and appeal the whole market with one offer or one strategy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Mass Marketing   |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/mass-marketing.html  |quote=Business Dictionary |accessdate = 2 May 2012 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which supports the idea of broadcasting a message that will reach the largest number of people possible. Traditionally mass marketing has focused on radio, television and newspapers as the media used to reach this broad audience. By reaching the largest audience possible, exposure to the product is maximized, and in theory this would directly correlate with a larger number of sales or buys into the product.

Mass marketing is the opposite of [[niche marketing]], as it focuses on '''high sales and low prices''' and aims to provide products and services that will appeal to the whole market. Niche marketing targets a very specific segment of market; for example, specialized services or goods with few or no competitors.&lt;ref&gt;“Niche Market.” ''Business: The ultimate resource''. (2002). Cambridge, Mass: Perseus Publications:1294.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Mass marketing or undifferentiated marketing has its origins in the 1920s with the inception of mass [[radio]] use. This gave [[corporations]] an opportunity to appeal to a wide variety of potential customers. Due to this, variety marketing had to be changed in order to persuade a wide audience with different needs into buying the same thing. It has developed over the years into a worldwide multi-billion dollar industry. Although sagging in the Great Depression it regained popularity and continued to expand through the 40s and 50s. It slowed during the anti-capitalist movements of the 60's and 70's before coming back stronger than before in the 80's, 90's and today. These trends are due to corresponding upswings in mass media, the parent of mass marketing. For most of the twentieth century, major consumer-products companies held fast to mass marketing- mass-producing, mass distributing and mass promoting about the same product in about the same way to all consumers. Mass marketing creates the largest potential market, which leads to lowered costs.
It is also called overall marketing.

Over the years marketing activities have notably transitioned from traditional forms, such as television, radio and print advertisements to a more digitalized forms, such as the utilisation of online media platforms to reach various consumers. Huang (2009, as cited in Shyu et al., 2015), explains three chief attributes digital marketing has enhanced; one being “Penetrating Power” which is to have the ability to reach a wider circle of customers in the market, accredited to the ease of online communication. Digital marketing allows for a marketer to reach a larger-scale audience in a more efficient and cost-effective manner, which is ultimately what Mass Marketing seeks to do.&lt;ref&gt;Shyu, M., Chiang, W., Chien, W., &amp; Wang, S. (2015). Key success factors in Digital Marketing in Service Industry and the Development Strategies: A case study on Fleur De Chine at Sun Moon Lake. ''International Journal of Organizational Innovation, 8''(1), 172-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persuasion in mass marketing ==
For a mass marketing campaign to be successful, the advertisement must appeal to a “set of product needs that are common to most consumers in a target market.” (Bennett &amp; Strydom, 2001) In this case it is unnecessary to segment consumers into separate niches as, in theory, the product should appeal to any customer’s wants and/or needs. Many mass marketing campaigns have been successful through persuading audiences using the central route to persuasion, as well as using the peripheral route to persuasion, according to the [[Elaboration likelihood model|Elaboration Likelihood Model]].  Lane et al. state that the different types of persuasion depend on the “involvement, issue-relevant thinking, or elaboration that a person dedicates to a persuasive message.” (2013).&lt;ref&gt;Lane, R., Miller, A. N., Brown, C., &amp; Vilar, N. (2013). An Examination of the Narrative Persuasion with Epilogue through the lens of the Elaboration Likelihood Model. ''Communication Quarterly, 61''(4), 431-445. doi: 10.1080/01463373.2013.799510&lt;/ref&gt; Political campaigns are a prime example of central persuasion through mass marketing; where the content of the communication involves a detailed level of thinking which seeks to achieve a cognitive response. Contrastingly, a toothpaste advertisement would typically persuade the audience peripherally; where there is low involvement and consumers rely on “heuristics” to alter their behaviour. [[John Watson (psychologist)|John Watson]] was a leading [[psychologist]] in mass marketing with his experiments in advertising.

== Shotgun approach ==
The shotgun theory is an approach of mass marketing. It involves reaching as many people as possible through television, cable and radio. On the Web, it refers to a lot of [[advertising]] done through banners to text ads in as many websites as possible, in order to get enough eyeballs that will hopefully turn into sales. An example of shotgun marketing would be to simply place an ad on primetime television, without focusing on any specific group of audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techopedia.com/definition/24119/shotgun-approach |title=shotgun marketing &amp;#124;  |quote=Undifferentiated audience}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shotgun approach increases the odds of hitting a target when it is more difficult to focus on one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essentials of marketing |last1= Mc Daniel |first1= Carl|last2 = F.Hair|first2=Joseph|last3=Lamb|first3=Charles W.|isbn=0324656203|page=224 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9Kf_O1eI0J4C&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=marketing+approaches+-+shotgun+approach#v=onepage&amp;q=marketing%20approaches%20-%20shotgun%20approach&amp;f=false |date=January 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential limitation of using the shotgun approach is that each receiver will interpret the message in their own way, whether this be the way the sender intends for it to be decoded, or not. In other words, the receiver’s “frame of reference” at the time of decoding enables them to perceive a brand message in a particular way; thus, the marketer’s intention may be become distorted. Dahlen, Lange, &amp; Smith (2010) claim that each receiver has different “attitudes, values and perceptions stemming from knowledge, experience or the influence of other people.” In situations where there is no specific target market, mass marketers should simply focus on grabbing the attention of consumers in “different, surprising, original and entertaining” ways in order to generate the most desirable feedback. (Bigat, 2012).

== Guerrilla marketing ==
[[Guerrilla marketing]] aims to cut through clutter by attracting attention in unique, memorable and imaginative ways to “maximise interest in a firm’s goods and services while minimizing the costs of advertising.” (Bigat, 2012). According to Kotler (2007, as cited in Bigat, 2012) this type of marketing was traditionally carried out by small to medium sized enterprises but has become more predominant in today’s society where competition is substantially thicker. It is particularly effective at reaching a large-scale audience due to the captivating nature of the advertisement.

Bigat discusses the role of technology, more specifically, of the internet and its effectiveness of disseminating a large message from the sender to receivers; to which he states that “Internet blogs, online magazines, newspapers along with chat and forum pages are crucial arenas for getting the message across.” Logically, this is due to the fact that digitalised media generates more efficient feedback from consumers. Mass marketers should aim to effect the behaviour of their consumers by having them engage with the brand in a positive way, which, in turn tends to more activity (both on and offline) as well as further market penetration.&lt;ref&gt;Bigat, E. C. (2012). Guerrilla Advertisement and Marketing. ''Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences, 51''(1), 1022-1029. doi: 10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.08.281&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use and products sold ==
Mass marketing is used to effect attitude change to as wide an audience as possible. Often this would take the form of selling a product like [[toothpaste]]. Toothpaste isn't made specially for one consumer and it is sold in huge quantities. A company or individual who manufactures toothpaste wishes to get more people to buy their particular brand over another. The goal is when a consumer has the option to select a tube of toothpaste that the consumer would remember the product which was marketed. Mass marketing is the opposite of [[niche marketing]], where a product is made specially for one person or a group of persons. Other products of mass marketing are [[furniture]], [[Visual arts|artwork]], [[automobile]]s, residential communities, fizzy drinks and [[personal computer]]s. Typically, things which are perceived to be necessary/essential to the consumer are subject to mass marketing. Resources of mass marketing provide cost-effective marketing solutions for small and micro businesses, including start-ups. Even "products" like [[politicians]] and services from [[professions]] such as [[law]], [[chiropractic]] and [[medicine]], are subject to mass marketing.

== Questions of quality ==
To further increase profits, mass marketed products touted as "[[durable goods]]" are often made of substandard material, so that they deteriorate prematurely. This practice is called [[planned obsolescence]].  Not only does this lower production costs, but it ensures future sales opportunities by preventing the market from becoming saturated with high-quality, long-lasting goods. The forces of a [[free market]] tend to preclude the sale of substandard staples, while disposability, technological innovations, and a culture of collection all facilitate [[planned obsolescence]].

Many mass marketed items are considered [[staple food|staples]].  These are items people are accustomed to buying new when their old ones wear out (or are used up).  Cheaper versions of durable goods are often marketed as staples with the understanding that they will wear out sooner than more expensive goods, but they are so cheap that the cost of regular replacement is easily affordable.

==Benefits of mass marketing==
Since the target audience is broad, the number of successful hits is high despite the low probability of a single person turning up, and if all the efforts in one particular area goes in vain, the eventual loss is less compared to one in a narrowly focused area. Production costs per unit are low on account of having one production run for homogeneous product, and marketing research/advertising costs are also relatively low as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to travel and tourism marketing |last= Bennett | first= J. Alf |last2=Strydom | first2=Johan Wilhelm |year=2001 | page=62 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=USqcuWxTemEC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=benefits+of+mass+marketing#v=onepage&amp;q=benefits%20of%20mass%20marketing&amp;f=false |isbn = 0702156361 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, as a whole, leads to higher potentials of sales volume and efficiency of scale in a much larger market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marketing |last1= L. Burrow | first1= James |last2 =Bosiljevac | first2=Jim |year=2005|publisher=South Western Educational Publishing | page=183 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=royU59GUZiEC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=marketing+approaches+-+mass+marketing+advantages#v=onepage&amp;q=marketing%20approaches%20-%20mass%20marketing%20advantages&amp;f=false | isbn= 0538446641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drawbacks of mass marketing ==
Due to increased competition and the complexity of consumers’ wants and needs in today’s society, Bennett and Strydom (2001) suggest that mass marketing campaigns are less likely to be successful; as consumers have a range of specific tastes and requirements that they would more likely find in alternative products.

'''Michael Puscar''' is an Italian entrepreneur and venture capitalist. Puscar has founded several companies including Yuxi Pacific, GITP Ventures, Miguelo Romano and Betiply, among others. He is a part of the business community changing the economy in [[Medellin, Colombia]].

In 2013, Michael Puscar was a passenger on a [[Alitalia]] flight when it crash-landed at [[Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport]] in Rome, Italy. Puscar captured video of the crash from his seat on the plane, and this video was distributed in several major media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video captures panic INSIDE plane during Rome crash-landing|url=http://travel.aol.co.uk/2013/10/01/video-rome-crash-landing-inside-Alitalia-plane/|publisher=AOL Travel|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italy plane crash seen from inside the aircraft|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/10347811/Italy-plane-crash-seen-from-inside-the-aircraft.html|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business ventures==
===Yuxi Pacific===
In 2005, Puscar launched Yuxi Pacific, a professional services firm founded in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and focused on the creation of digital products for the publishing industry.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moules|first1=Jonathan|title=Start-ups rise as murders plummet in Medellín|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a52cf2a6-f262-11e3-9e59-00144feabdc0.html#axzz4H48x4Yaz|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Puscar brought Yuxi Pacific to [[Medellin, Colombia]].&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt; By 2013, the company had more than 100 employees in Medellín and had quadrupled its annual revenues.&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt;

Puscar has been dubbed a hero in the "Medellin Miracle," a transformation in which the city changes its reputation from the land of violent [[drug cartel]]s to a modern metropolis.&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foster"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foster|first1=Nick|title=Goodbye Gangland|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5be744d0-8aac-11e2-9da4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz4H48x4Yaz|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Puscar supports government backing, he believes private initiatives will ultimately lead to the rebranding of Colombia.&lt;ref name="egusa"/&gt; Puscar has written about the Colombian economy.&lt;ref name="conundrum"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Puscar|first1=Michael|title=Colombia’s currency conundrum|url=http://colombiareports.com/colombias-currency-conundrum/|publisher=Colombia Reports|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puscar has given back to the community, donating computers to local Colombian schools.&lt;ref name="egusa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Egusa|first1=Conrad|title=Colombia Is One Of Latin America’s Most Promising New Tech Hubs|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/22/an-overview-of-colombia-one-of-latin-americas-most-promising-new-tech-hubs/|publisher=Tech Crunch|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michigan Avenue''' is a north-south street in [[Chicago]] which runs at 100 east on the [[Roads and freeways in Chicago#Grid|Chicago grid]]. The northern end of the street is at [[Lake Shore Drive]] on the shore of [[Lake Michigan]] in the [[Gold Coast Historic District (Chicago)|Gold Coast Historic District]].  The street's southern terminus is at [[Illinois Route 83|Sibley Boulevard]] in the southern suburb of [[Harvey, Illinois|Harvey]], though like many Chicago streets it exists in several disjointed segments.&lt;ref name=SCMA&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayner|first=Don|first2=Tom|last2=McNamee|title=Streetwise Chicago, Michigan Avenue/Michigan Avenue (Pvt.)|page=87|publisher=Loyola University Press|year=1988|isbn=0-8294-0597-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the home of the [[Chicago Water Tower]], the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], [[Millennium Park]], and the  shopping on the [[Magnificent Mile]], it is a street well known to Chicago natives as well as [[Tourism in Chicago|tourists]] to the city.  Michigan Avenue also is the main commercial street of [[Streeterville]]. It includes all of the [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]] and most of the [[Michigan–Wacker Historic District]], including the scenic urban space anchored by the [[Michigan Avenue Bridge]].

==History==
[[File:Collier's 1921 Vol 2 Frontispiece -- Chicago.jpg|thumb|200px|left|1921 [[Collier's Magazine]] Michigan Avenue from Grant Park]]

The oldest section of Michigan Avenue is the portion that currently borders [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] in the [[Chicago Loop]] section of the city. The name came from [[Lake Michigan]], which until 1871 was immediately east of Michigan Avenue. The street at that time ran north to the [[Chicago River]] and south to the city limits. Originally, Michigan Avenue was primarily residential, and by the 1860s, large homes and expensive row houses dominated Michigan Avenue.

At no point is Michigan Avenue currently called Michigan Boulevard, but prior to the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, the street was officially known as Michigan Boulevard and often referred to as "Boul Mich".&lt;ref name=CLBMT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/Tours/BoulMich.html|title=Boul Mich Tour|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|year=2003|accessdate=2007-05-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033614/http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/Tours/BoulMich.html|archivedate=2007-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in the 1900-1907 Ads for the Chicago Musical College, the address was referred to as "202 Michigan Boul." As recently as the 1920s, North Michigan Avenue (especially the [[Magnificent Mile]]) was referred to as "Upper Boul Mich".&lt;ref name="CNMAic"&gt;Stamper, John M., "Chicago's North Michigan Avenue," University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. ix, {{ISBN|0-226-77085-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Paris]]'s [[Boulevard Saint-Michel]] is the original Boul Mich.

North of the Chicago River today's Michigan Avenue was known as Pine Street. In 1866 a small portion of Pine Street was "vacated" and moved eighty (80) feet further west of the original Pine street location to accommodate the installation of the new pumping station's standpipe. This standpipe, engineered to regulate water pressure, would be housed within architect William W. Boyington's castle structure (Water Tower) that still stands on that site today. In 1869 the Board of Public Works began paving Pine Street from Chicago Avenue to Whitney street (today, Walton street) the northern terminus, with Belgian wood blocks also known as Nicolson pavement.

Pine Street was renamed to Lincoln Park Boulevard as far south as Ohio Street when the street connected with Lake Shore Drive in the early 1890s, and then became part of Michigan Avenue, which already had the name Michigan Avenue (Michigan Boulevard before the Great Chicago Fire in 1871) south of the Chicago River. Both the North and South Michigan Avenues were joined physically with the opening of the Michigan Avenue bridge in 1920. In 1926, after years of clogged automobile traffic, the water tower and pumping station were separated by realigning Michigan Avenue to run between them.[[File:Art Institute, Chicago circa 1907 postcard (front).tiff|thumb|right|250px|A [[postcard]] of the Art Institute posted 1907]]

In the [[Great Chicago Fire|Great Fire of 1871]], all buildings on Michigan Avenue from Congress Street north to the river were destroyed. Immediately after the fire, the character of Michigan remained residential, but the street no longer was directly on the lake shore, as after the Fire, wreckage from the burnt district was used to fill in the inner harbor of Chicago, beginning the landfills that by the 1920s had moved the lake shore more than a quarter-mile east of its original shoreline, creating space for an expanded Grant Park. Beginning in the 1880s, the expansion of the central business district replaced houses on Michigan Avenue so that today, Michigan's character is primarily commercial north of 35th Street.

The first city showcase on Michigan Avenue was the Exposition Building, which was built on the current site of the Art Institute, the east side of Michigan at Adams, in 1874.  By the 1890s, an imposing wall of buildings was constructed on the west side of Michigan Avenue downtown, including the [[Auditorium Building, Chicago|Auditorium Building]] and the main branch of the [[Chicago Public Library]] (now the [[Chicago Cultural Center]]).  As the east side of Michigan Avenue downtown was developed as a park, the wall of buildings lining the west side of Michigan Avenue across from the park became the nucleus of the city's skyline.

In 1924, the first [[traffic light]]s in Chicago were installed on Michigan Avenue after [[John D. Hertz]] fronted the city $34,000 for the purchase, installation, and maintenance.&lt;ref name="magazine"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Golden opportunity | newspaper = Chicago Tribune Magazine | pages = 31 | date = 2007-11-25 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, [[Illinois Route 1]] and [[U.S. Route 41]] were routed on Michigan Avenue. Illinois Route 1 has been truncated to Chicago's south side and U.S. Route 41 is now routed on Lake Shore Drive.

Michigan Avenue originally ended at the Chicago River, and what is now Michigan Avenue north of the river was originally named Pine Street, after scattered pine trees originally found in its vicinity. As early as 1891 plans were proposed to extend Michigan Avenue north across the river.&lt;ref name="Tribune19200514"&gt;{{cite news|title="I Will" Spirit Wins; Open Link Bridge Today|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=May 14, 1920|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Great Boulevard Subway Project for Connecting North and South Divisions of the City|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=January 22, 1903|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1903 an editorial in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' [[newspaper]] proposed a new [[Bascule bridge]] across the river at Michigan Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Michigan Avenue Dream|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=May 31, 1903|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Experts Praise Boulevard Plan|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 21, 1903|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This plan was further elaborated upon in [[Daniel Burnham]]'s [[1909 Plan of Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burnham|first=Daniel H.|authorlink=Daniel Burnham|last2=Bennett|first2=Edward H.|authorlink2=Edward H. Bennett|title=Plan of Chicago|year=1909|publisher=The Commercial Club of Chicago|url=https://archive.org/details/planofchicago00burnuoft|accessdate=December 24, 2010|pages=101–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1911 a plan was selected that included the widening of Michigan Avenue from Randolph Street to the river, replacing the Rush Street bridge with a new bridge at Michigan Avenue and the construction of a double-decked boulevard along Pine Street as far as Ohio Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wide Boulevard Scheme Chosen|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=July 11, 1911|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Michigan Avenue Bridge]] was completed, Pine Street was renamed Michigan Avenue.  At its north end it merges into [[Lake Shore Drive]] near the [[Drake Hotel (Chicago)|Drake Hotel]].

Today, the area north of the [[Chicago River]] is referred to as the "[[Magnificent Mile]]", or sometimes simply the Mag Mile. It contains a mixture of upscale [[department store]]s, restaurants, high-end retailers, office buildings and [[hotel]]s, and caters primarily to [[tourist]]s and the affluent. The area also has a high concentration of the city's [[advertising agency|advertising agencies]] and major [[Mass media|media]] firms, including the ''Chicago Tribune''.

It is the home of Chicago's famous [[Chicago Water Tower|Water Tower]] landmark, [[Water Tower Park]] with its historic clock, as well as the eight-level [[Water Tower Place]] shopping center which grew up next door to, and overshadowed, the comparatively diminutive landmark.  North of the shopping center can be found the famous [[John Hancock Center]], the [[art deco]] [[Palmolive Building]] (also known as the ''[[Playboy]]'' Building) and the lavish [[Drake Hotel (Chicago)|Drake Hotel]]. The entire mile is noted for its spectacular [[Christmas]] displays. At the northern edge of this district can be found the [[One Magnificent Mile]] building; [[Chicago Landmark]] [[East Lake Shore Drive District]], an extremely expensive and exclusive one-block area of [[real estate]] running east from North Michigan Avenue and facing directly onto [[Lake Michigan]]; and the on-ramp to northbound [[Lake Shore Drive]].

For a few blocks on both sides of the [[Chicago River]], the road is double-decked, including the bridge over the river. The lower level north of the river is where the famous [[Billy Goat Tavern]] is located, and south of the river it intersects with Lower Wacker Drive.  On the upper lever, tall office buildings and hotels line both sides of the Avenue, until [[Millennium Park]].

The portion of Michigan Avenue opposite [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] is the [[Chicago Landmark]] [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]]. Major cultural institutions, such as the [[Chicago Cultural Center]], [[Symphony Center]], and the [[Auditorium Theater]] are located here, as are many late 19th and early 20th century skyscrapers. In 2009, the Chicago Cultural Mile Association was created to bring "awareness of the unique strengths and diverse offerings available to visitors"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagoculturalmile.org/about/our-history/|title=Our History - Chicago Cultural Mile|work=Chicago Cultural Mile|access-date=2017-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this portion of Michigan Avenue.

The [[Art Institute of Chicago]] is across the boulevard, in Grant Park along the Avenue.  Several large historic hotels are located just south of [[Congress Parkway]], including the Hilton Towers Chicago (formerly, the Stevens Hotel), the [[Congress Plaza Hotel]] and the [[Blackstone Hotel]]. Between them is the [[Spertus Institute]] of Jewish Studies.

The Avenue extends south into [[Near South Side, Chicago]] and beyond – past what was once the notorious [[Levee District]], the graceful homes of the [[Prairie Avenue District]], the historic [[Second Presbyterian Church (Chicago, Illinois)|Second Presbyterian Church]], the former home of the legendary [[Chess Records]] at 2120 South Michigan and the site where the [[Lexington Hotel]], a hideout of [[Al Capone]], once stood.

South of [[Cermak Road]] is the [[Motor Row District]], a historic strip along Michigan Avenue that was home to many early 20th century automobile "palaces." A point of interest in this area is the former Illinois Automobile Club, which later was used as the home of the [[Chicago Defender]], a prominent African-American Chicago newspaper at 2400 South Michigan. A little bit further south is [[Douglas, Chicago#Bronzeville|Bronzeville]], a historic black community in Chicago. Points of interest include the historic [[Mercy Hospital and Medical Center]], the [[Illinois College of Optometry]] and the [[South Side Community Art Center]].

The intersection of Michigan Avenue and 35th Street is home to two important local institutions. On the northwest corner is [[De La Salle Institute]], a Catholic high school which was attended by future [[Chicago mayors]] [[Richard J. Daley]], [[Richard M. Daley]], and [[Michael Bilandic]]. On the southwest corner is the [[Chicago Police Department]] Headquarters. Michigan Avenue continues through the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] and dead ends at 63rd Street, just north of a rail yard and parking lots.

The Avenue continues heading south at 66th Street to Marquette Road, where it moves a half-block to the east back into alignment with the run north of 63rd Street. It then continues south to 89th Street where it dead ends once again for a housing subdivision and a railroad line. It resumes at 91st Street heading south through the working class [[Roseland, Chicago|Roseland]] community, featuring a large commercial strip along Michigan between 111th and 115th streets. The street dead ends again at 127th Street just before the [[Cal-Sag Channel]]. It begins again in the south [[suburb]] of [[Riverdale, Illinois|Riverdale]] before finally terminating at Sibley Boulevard or IL RT-83.

==Transportation==
The [[Red Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|CTA Red Line]]'s Chicago and Grand stations are useful for reaching the Magnificent Mile.  The Jackson station is close to the Art Institute, as are Loop stations on the Brown, Pink and Blue lines. [[Millennium Station|Millennium]] and [[Van Buren Street (Metra station)|Van Buren Street]] Stations are located along Michigan Avenue serving the [[Metra Electric Line|Metra Electric]] and [[South Shore Line|South Shore]] Lines. The avenue is also traversed by a multitude of bus routes and taxi cabs primarily in the Downtown and [[Magnificent Mile]] areas.

'''Mosaic''' UK is [[Experian]]’s system for classification of UK households. It is one of a number of commercially available [[geodemographic segmentation]] systems, applying the principles of [[geodemography]] to consumer household and individual data collated from a number of governmental and commercial sources. The statistical development of the system was led by Professor Richard Webber in association with Experian in the 1980s and it has gone through a number of refreshes and reclassifications since then, each based on more recent data from national censuses and numerous other sources. Since its initial development in the UK, the Mosaic brand name has also been used to market separate products which classify other national consumers, now including most of Western Europe, USA, the Far East and Australia.

The initial UK version was based at the postcode level, which would cover an average of 20 properties with the same code. More recent versions have been developed at the individual household level and offer more accurate classification based on specific characteristics of each household. The current version, Mosaic UK 2009, classifies the UK population into 15 main socio-economic groups and, within this, 67 different types.

Professor Webber also developed the competing [[Acorn (demographics)|ACORN]] system with [[CACI]].  Both Mosaic and Acorn have found application outside their original purpose of direct marketing, including governmental estimates and forecasts and it is regularly employed by life insurance companies and pension funds in the UK to assess longevity for pricing and reserving.&lt;ref name=insurance&gt;[https://www.actuaries.org.uk/documents/applying-survival-models-pensioner-mortality-data-0 Richards, S. J. Applying survival models to pensioner mortality data, British Actuarial Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; Both are also used extensively in understanding local service users, although Mosaic’s naming has proved to be controversial leading Experian to introduce Mosaic Public Sector with more politically correct segment names.


==Mosaic 2010 Classifications==
A new revision to Mosaic classification was released in 2010.&lt;ref name="2010 Grand Index"&gt;[http://www.nottinghaminsight.org.uk/d/64159 Mosaic 2010 Grand Index]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Path Analysis Graphic.png|400px|thumb|A path analysis graph]] --&gt;
'''Path analysis''', is the analysis of a path, which is a portrayal of a chain of consecutive events that a given user or cohort performs during a set period of time while using a website, online game, or eCommerce platform. As a subset of [[behavioral analytics]], path analysis is a way to understand user behavior in order to gain actionable insights into the data. Path analysis provides a visual portrayal of every event a user or cohort performs as part of a path during a set period of time.

While it is possible to track a user’s path through the site, and even show that path as a visual representation, the real question is how to gain these actionable insights. If path analysis simply outputs a "pretty"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thayer|first=Shelby|title=Why Do We Care About Path Analysis?|url=http://www.trendingupward.net/2008/09/ditch-path-analysis/|work=Trending Upward}}&lt;/ref&gt;  graph, while it may look nice, it does not provide anything concrete to act upon.

==Examples==
In order to get the most out of path analysis the first step would be to determine what needs to be analyzed and what are the goals of the analysis. A company might be trying to figure out why their site is running slow, are certain types of users interested in certain pages or products, or if their user interface is set up in a logical way.

Now that the goal has been set there are a few ways of performing the analysis. If a large percentage of a certain cohort, people between the ages of 18-25, logs into an online game, creates a profile and then spends the next 10 minutes wandering around the menu page, then it may be that the user interface is not logical. By seeing this group of users following the path that they did a developer will be able to analyze the data and realize that after creating a profile, the “play game” button does not appear. Thus, path analysis was able to provide actionable data for the company to act on and fix an error.

In eCommerce, path analysis can help customize a shopping experience to each user. By looking at what products other customers in a certain cohort looked at before buying one, a company can suggest “items you may also like” to the next customer and increase the chances of them making a purchase. Also, path analysis can help solve performance issues on a platform. For example, a company looks at a path and realizes that their site freezes up after a certain combinations of events. By analyzing the path and the progression of events that led to the error, the company can pinpoint the error and fix it.

==Evolution==

Historically path analysis fell under the broad category of [[website analytics]], and related only to the analysis of paths through websites. Path analysis in [[website analytics]] is a process of determining a sequence of pages visited in a visitor session prior to some desired event, such as the visitor purchasing an item or requesting a newsletter.  The precise order of pages visited may or may not be important and may or may not be specified.  In practice, this analysis is done in aggregate, ranking the paths (sequences of pages) visited prior to the desired event, by descending frequency of use.  The idea is to determine what features of the website encourage the desired result.  "Fallout analysis," a subset of path analysis, looks at "black holes" on the site, or paths that lead to a dead end most frequently, paths or features that confuse or lose potential customers.

With the advent of big data along with web-based applications, online games, and eCommerce platforms, path analysis has come to include much more than just web path analysis. Understanding how users move through an app, game, or other web platform are all part of modern-day path analysis.

== Understanding visitors ==
In the real world when you visit a shop the shelves and products are not placed in a random order. The shop owner carefully analyzes the visitors and path they walk through the shop, especially when they are selecting or buying products. Next the shop owner will reorder the shelves and products to optimize sales by putting everything in the most logical order for the visitors. In a supermarket this will typically result in the wine shelf next to a variety of cookies, chips, nuts, etc. Simply because people drink wine and eat nuts with it.

In most web sites there is a same logic that can be applied. Visitors who have questions about a product will go to the product information or support section of a web site. From there they make a logical step to the frequently asked questions page if they have a specific question. A web site owner also wants to analyze visitor behavior. For example, if a web site offers products for sale, the owner wants to convert as many visitors to a completed purchase. If there is a sign-up form with multiple pages, web site owners want to guide visitors to the final sign-up page.

Path analysis answers typical questions like: &lt;br /&gt;
''Where do most visitors go after they enter my home page?''&lt;br /&gt;
''Is there a strong visitor relation between product A and product B on my web site?''. &lt;br /&gt;
Questions that can't be answered by page hits and unique visitors statistics.

== Funnels and goals ==

Google Analytics provides a path function with funnels and goals. A predetermined path of web site pages is specified and every visitor walking the path is a goal. This approach is very helpful when analyzing how many visitors reach a certain destination page, called an end point analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis Tools|url=https://www.google.com/analytics/features/analysis-tools.html|publisher=Google Analytics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using maps ==

The paths visitors walk in a web site can lead to an endless number of unique paths. As a result, there is no point in analyzing each path, but to look for the strongest paths. These strongest paths are typically shown in a graphical map or in text like: Page A --&gt; Page B --&gt; Page D --&gt; Exit.

A '''PhD-MBA''' or '''MBA-PhD''' is a [[double degree|dual degree]] program offered in some cases by schools of science, engineering or social science, jointly with [[business school]]s. The program generally lasts four to eight years and results in the candidate earning both a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) degree and a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) degree. Students may apply to the joint program before matriculating to either program, or after matriculating to the PhD programme. The programme often attracts [[entrepreneur]]s and [[venture capitalist]]s.

Some of the leading PhD-MBA programs are offered by universities like:
* [http://graduate.wfu.edu/admissions/phdmba.html  The Wake Forest University PhD/MBA program] was established in 1999 and was the first of its type in the nation. The program is a joint degree between the Wake Forest University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Wake Forest Schools of Business. Dr. Dwayne Godwin is the program director. The degrees are earned concurrently and the average time to awarding both degrees is 5.2 years. 
* [http://www.bio.udel.edu/dual-degree-phd-biological-sciences-and-master-business-administration-mba/ The University of Delaware's] Department of Biological Sciences and the Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics,  jointly administer this program since 2006.
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130207130950/http://graduate.dartmouth.edu/programs/dartmouthphdmba.html Dartmouth], in USA since 2009,
* [[Yale University]],  Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences with Yale School of Management
* [[University of Miami]]
* [[Penn State College of Medicine]]
* The alliance of two members of [[Sorbonne University]] and the [[Collège des Ingénieurs]]: [[UMPC]] for Sciences and Technology and [[Paris-Sorbonne]] for Humanities, in France since 2009,
* or the similar alliance of [http://www.kit.edu KIT] and the [http://www.cdi.eu Collège des Ingénieurs], in Germany since 2010,
* [http://www.phd-mba.nus.edu.sg/ National University of Singapore] (since 2011).

'''''R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport'''''&lt;ref&gt;By convention, for judicial review cases the monarch appears in the title of the case as the nominal bringer of the action. In reality the action was brought by Factortame Limited against the Secretary of State.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[judicial review]] case taken against the [[United Kingdom government]] by a company of Spanish fishermen who claimed that the United Kingdom had breached [[European Union law]] by requiring ships to have a majority of British owners if they were to be registered in the UK. The case produced a number of significant judgments on British constitutional law, and was the first time that courts held that they had power to restrain the application of an Act of Parliament pending trial and ultimately to disapply that Act when it was found to be contrary to EU law.

The litigation was lengthy, and is typically divided into five main stages:
*''Factortame I'', where the High Court and then the House of Lords both made a reference to the [[European Court of Justice]] on the legality of the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1988]]'s ("MSA") requirement for UK fishing vessels to be 75% UK owned. After the ECJ confirmed the incompatibility of the Act with EU law, ''Factortame'' saw the House of Lords confirm the [[Supremacy (European Union law)|supremacy]] of [[EU law]] over national law in the areas where the EU has [[Principle of conferral|competence]] because of the UK acceding to the EU treaties.&lt;ref&gt;The House of Lords judgment is referred to as ''R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport (No 2)'' [1991] 1 AC 603.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Factortame II'', where the ECJ held that the provisions of the MSA were required to be disapplied by the UK courts if they contravened EU law.
*''Factortame III'', where the ECJ held that a member state could be liable for damages in an action by the European Commission for breach of EU law.
*''Factortame IV'', where the House of Lords ruled that damages could be awarded against a member state like the UK for losses suffered by private parties under the ''[[Francovich v Italy]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1990) C-6/90&lt;/ref&gt; principle, that wrongs by violation of a public body generate a private law claim from anybody who has suffered a directly connected loss (also known as the doctrine of [[state liability]]).
*''Factortame V''&lt;!--which court?--&gt;, holding that claims after 1996 were statute-barred, since claims against a member state were like other claims in [[tort]] under the [[Limitation Act 1980]].

==Facts==
The EU's [[Common Fisheries Policy]], which began in 1970, aimed at creating a common market for fisheries products by providing for free access to the waters of all [[member states]] and introducing [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds|structural funds]] to ensure modernisation of the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/expert/displayFtu.do?language=en&amp;id=74&amp;ftuId=FTU_4.4.1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511015910/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/expert/displayFtu.do?language=en&amp;id=74&amp;ftuId=FTU_4.4.1.html |archivedate=11 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 it was agreed that, as from 1 January the following year, member states would extend their [[exclusive economic zone]], which included the limit of their fishing zones, to a distance {{convert|200|nmi|km}} from their coastlines. In 1980 the EU concluded a fisheries agreement with Spain, which did not become a member of the EU until 1985,&lt;ref name=tcl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomascooperlaw.com/factortamebackground.html|title=Thomas Cooper Law: "FACTORTAME BACKGROUND"|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116105902/http://www.thomascooperlaw.com/factortamebackground.html|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gave the latter (which had the largest fishing fleet in Europe) limited rights to fish in the waters of the member states. In 1983 concerns over the effect that equality of access might have on [[overfishing|fishing stocks]] led to the introduction of certain controls, notably the concept of "[[total allowable catch]]es" which set maximum quotas of fish which could be caught by each member state, and the [[British Fishing Boats Act 1983]] (BFBA).&lt;ref name=tcl/&gt; In 1985, with Spanish accession, everything changed and the BFBA no longer applied to the Spanish fishermen.&lt;ref name=tcl/&gt;

From 1980, as seen earlier, Galician fishermen began to enter the UK fishing market by taking advantage of easy [[fishing vessel]] registration requirements contained in the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1894]].  Although the 1894 Act prohibited ownership of vessels by non-UK nationals, UK-domiciled companies were allowed registration as the owners. Amongst the early beneficiaries of the 1894 Act was Factortame Limited, a company whose directors were Joseph J L Couceiro, John A Couceiro and Ken L Couceiro, all British nationals with Spanish ancestry resident and [[Domicile (law)|domiciled]] in the United Kingdom. The company, together with 96 others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomascooperlaw.com/factortameabout.html|title=Thomas Cooper Law: "ABOUT FACTORTAME"|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116105900/http://www.thomascooperlaw.com/factortameabout.html|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose directors and shareholders were mostly Spanish nationals, re-registered 53 vessels which had formerly flown the Spanish flag as British fishing vessels under the 1894 Act. They also acquired 42 existing British vessels with a view to using them in the fishing zone. Most of these vessels landed their catches in Spain, but as the fish were caught in UK waters, they counted against the UK fishing quota, a practice known as "quota hopping".

In order to put an end to this practice, the British Government enacted a series of measures which proved largely ineffective. In two cases the High Court of Justice of England and Wales asked [[preliminary questions]] to ECJ; based on which both cases were lost by HMG - see [[Agegate]] (C-3/87, {{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1989:650}}) and [[Jaderow]] (C-216/87, {{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1989:651}}).&lt;ref name=tcl/&gt; In 1988 the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1988]] and the [[Merchant Shipping (Registration of Fishing Vessels) Regulations]] were introduced as a result, to replace the system of registration contained in the 1894 Act with a new system under which a vessel could only be registered if it had "a genuine and substantial connection" with the UK. For this to be the case, three conditions had to be fulfilled: (i) the vessel must be British-owned; (ii) the vessel had to be managed and its operations had to be directed and controlled from the UK; and (iii) any [[Chartering (shipping)|charterer]], manager or operator had to be a qualified person or company. A "qualified person or company" was a person who was a British citizen resident and domiciled in the UK or a company which was incorporated in the UK and had its principal place of business there having at least 75% of its shares owned by, and at least 75% of its directors being, "qualified persons".

As from 31 March 1989, fishing vessel registrations under the 1894 Act would lapse and the owners would be required to re-register under the 1988 Act. None of Factortame's vessels could satisfy the new requirements and an action for [[Judicial review in English Law|judicial review]] was brought by its owners in the [[Divisional Court]] of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]] in December 1988.

==''Factortame I''==
Factortame Ltd sought, first, a [[preliminary injunction]] declaring that the offending part of the 1988 Act could not be applied to them on the grounds that such application would be contrary to [[direct effect|directly effective]] rights under EU law, specifically the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality (article 7 of the [[Treaty of Rome]]), the right of individuals and companies to establish themselves in business anywhere in the EU (articles 43&amp;ndash;48), and the right to participate in the capital of companies situated in another Member State (article 294). The claimants also demanded an order of prohibition preventing the [[Secretary of State for Transport|Secretary of State]] from treating its registrations under the 1894 Act as having ceased.

HMG argued that the registration requirements were intended to ensure that fishing vessels flying the British flag had a genuine link with the UK. It maintained that international law entitled each State to determine the conditions under which a ship might fly its flag and that Community law had not removed that right. It was also contended that the 1988 Act was consistent with the Community policy on fisheries.  In the event this assertion proved false.

===High Court===
On 10 March 1989 the Divisional Court ([[Patrick Neill, Baron Neill of Bladen|Neill LJ]] and Hodgson J) referred the matter to the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) for a [[preliminary ruling]] under Article 234 of the Treaty of Rome (case C-221/89). It asked whether requirements as to nationality, domicile and control imposed by a Member State as conditions for the registration of fishing vessels were compatible with Community law (now: [[European Union law]]). At the same time, the Court granted an injunction against the application of the 1988 Act pending a ruling by the ECJ. Giving his judgment, Lord Justice Neill stated that although Community law is part of [[English law]] and prevails in the event of a conflict, it was open to argument whether a conflict existed in this case; a national court would have to take a decision which preserves the ''[[status quo ante bellum|status quo ante]]''. HMG disapproved and elevated the case to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]].

===Court of Appeal===
The Court of Appeal ([[John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington|Lord Donaldson MR]], [[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Bingham LJ]] and [[Michael Mann (judge)|Mann LJ]]) reversed the Divisional Court's decision on 22 March 1989 on the basis that, although a national court was obliged to give effect to Community law, it was not obliged "to override national law in favour of what is no more than an alleged or putative Community right". Furthermore, it did not believe that the Divisional Court had "acknowledged the constitutional enormity, as the law stands, of requiring a Secretary of State to act contrary to the clearly expressed will of Parliament when the unlawfulness of that expression has yet to be established". The Divisional Court would not, according to the court, have jurisdiction to grant an injunction until Factortame had succeeded before the ECJ.

===House of Lords===
The case was brought on 18 May 1989 by Factortame before the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] ([[Nigel Bridge, Baron Bridge of Harwich|Lord Bridge]], [[Henry Brandon, Baron Brandon of Oakbrook|Lord Brandon]], [[Peter Oliver, Baron Oliver of Aylmerton|Lord Oliver]], [[Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley|Lord Goff]] and [[Charles Jauncey, Baron Jauncey of Tullichettle|Lord Jauncey]]) who upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal on the grounds that English law did not contain any rule allowing a preliminary injunction against the application of an [[Act of Parliament]]. According to Lord Bridge, two obstacles stood in the way of the granting of the injunction. Firstly, the relief sought required the court to order positive action in the shape of the disapplication of the 1988 Act and the application of the 1894 Act; were Factortame not to succeed before the ECJ, the House of Lords would have "conferred upon them rights directly contrary to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]'s sovereign will". Secondly, the court had no jurisdiction to grant an interim injunction against the Crown.

Nevertheless, Lord Bridge did accept that each of these obstacles was subject to any contrary Community law requirement. This required the House of Lords to determine whether, regardless of the position in national law, there existed an overriding principle of Community law imposing an obligation on a national court, faced with a seriously arguable claim to rights having direct effect under Community law, to grant interim relief. Lord Bridge concluded that as there was no clear authority on this question, a decision from the ECJ was necessary to enable the House of Lords to give judgment. The House was, in any event, obliged to request a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC (now Article 267 TFEU post-Lisbon Treaty) which obliges courts "against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law" to make a reference. This request for a preliminary ruling was in addition to that already made by the Divisional Court on the compatibility of the 1988 Act with Community law.

===European Court of Justice===
The action was lodged at the [[ECJ]] on 10 July 1989 (as Case C-213/89) by the House of Lords with the request that it deal with the matter quickly, which it indeed did, giving the case priority over others. The whole matter had up until then proceeded with great speed, taking only 6 months from its commencement before the Divisional Court to the House of Lords' judgment. The questions posed essentially asked whether, in the circumstances of the case, Community law overrode English law and either empowered or obliged UK courts to grant the injunction claimed by Factortame.

[[Advocate-General]] [[Giuseppe Tesauro|Tesauro]] argued his opinion on 17 May 1990 ({{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1990:216}}). He first noted that the injunction sought by Factortame would in fact be available in all Member States except the UK and Denmark. He then proceeded to conclude that a national court must have the power to provisionally set aside a national law which conflicts with Community law, founding his argument on three bases. He recalled that it had been established in [[Simmenthal]] (case 106/77) that directly effective Community law provisions create legal rights which are enforceable by individuals from the date of their entry into force, regardless of any contrary national law. It also followed from the ECJ's case law that it was for the legal system of each Member State to designate the procedures intended to protect Community law rights, and that these procedures must not "be adapted so as it make it impossible in practice to exercise the rights which the national courts are required to protect" (case 61/79, [[Denkavit]], {{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1978:49}}). National courts must, in that respect, apply EC law through available national procedures or, failing that, of their own motion. Focusing on the House of Lords' argument that it could not temporarily suspend the application of a national law, the Advocate-General emphasised the importance of interim relief in every legal system, remarking that its purpose was to ensure that the time needed to establish a right would not deprive that right of any substance. Furthermore, he did not believe that national courts were entitled to give priority to national legislation merely because it had not yet been shown to be incompatible with Community law; if that were the case, rights conferred by national law would have greater protection than that offered to Community law rights.

On 19 June 1990 the ECJ court (as "full court" of 11 justices) ''en banc'' gave its ruling,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/EUECJ/1990/C21389.html bailii.org: 1st ECJ decision in re Factortame]. {{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1990:257}} Tesauro, AG; [[David Vaughan (attorney)|David Vaughan]], [[Gerald Barling]], [[David Anderson (attorney)|David Anderson]], and [[Stephen Swabey]] for the Applicant; [[Timothy J G Pratt]], Sir [[Nicholas Lyell]], [[Christopher Bellamy]], [[Christopher Vajda]] for the Respondent; as well as the state of Ireland, the [[European Commission]], and Rawlings Trawling Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; rephrasing the question posed as "whether a national court which, in a case before it concerning Community law, considers that the sole obstacle which precludes it from granting interim relief is a rule of national law, must disapply that rule". Following the Advocate-General's opinion, the ECJ held that a national court, in fact, has a duty to grant interim relief to safeguard alleged Community rights of individuals until the decision of the ECJ on the interpretation of Community law is available, and where a rule of national law would deny such relief, to set aside that rule. The basis of such a duty lies in the nature and object of directly effective Community law rights which are intended to be fully effective throughout the EU, and where, in order to safeguard such a right, it is necessary to grant interim measures, a national court must do so. This is especially true where a national court is awaiting a clarification or interpretation of the right claimed by the ECJ.

===Back to the House of Lords===
On 11 October 1990 the House of Lords gave its judgment in the light of the ECJ's ruling and granted an injunction in favour of Factortame. Three principal issues emerged from their judgment, namely the availability of interim relief against the Crown, the basis on which such relief can be granted, and the impact of the ruling on Parliamentary sovereignty. [[Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley|Lord Goff]] acknowledged that, as a matter of Community law, interim relief had to be available in principle against the Crown, and the basis for granting it lay in section 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (now titled the [[Senior Courts Act 1981]]).

In deciding to grant relief to Factortame, two factors influenced the House of Lords. Firstly, the likelihood that Factortame would suffer hardship and loss, were relief not to be allowed. Secondly, the prospects of Factortame succeeding in a full trial of the case once the ECJ had given its ruling on the compatibility of the 1988 Act; in this regard, the House of Lords took into account indications from the ECJ's first ruling that Factortame's arguments had "considerable force". Lord Goff did, however, emphasise that the courts would not, in other cases, readily or easily grant an injunction against the Crown which effectively prevents the Crown from applying national law.

Addressing the public criticism expressed following the ECJ's decision and the alleged erosion of Parliamentary sovereignty, [[Nigel Bridge, Baron Bridge of Harwich|Lord Bridge]] remarked that such comments were "based on a misconception", and that under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]], the law regulating the UK's membership of the EU, it had "always been clear that it was the duty of a United Kingdom court when delivering final judgment, to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law". In the same way that Parliament had introduced legislation to remedy areas of UK law which did not meet the standards set by EU [[Directive (European Union)|directives]], the House of Lords was now accomplishing the same task in giving judgment for Factortame. There was nothing new, in this respect, in recognising the supremacy of EU law in the areas in which it applies.

These comments&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Bridge]] [1991] 1 AC 603, 658; quoted in {{cite book  | last = Craig  | first = Paul  | authorlink = Paul Craig (law professor)  |author2=Gráinne de Búrca | title = EU Law, Text, Cases and Materials  | edition = 4th| year = 2007| publisher = Oxford University Press  | location = Oxford, New York  | isbn = 978-0-19-927389-8 |quote=Some public comments on the decision of the Court of Justice, affirming the jurisdiction of the courts of member states to override national legislation if necessary to enable interim relief to be granted in protection of rights under Community law, have suggested that this was a novel and dangerous invasion by a Community institution of the sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament. But such comments are based on a misconception. If the supremacy within the European Community of Community law over the national law of member states was not always inherent in the EEC Treaty it was certainly well established in the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice long before the United Kingdom joined the Community. Thus whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary. Under the terms of the 1972 Act it has always been clear that it was the duty of a United Kingdom court, when delivering final judgment, to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law. ... Thus there is nothing in any way novel in according supremacy to rules of Community law in those areas to which they apply ...|page=367f}}&lt;/ref&gt; were perceived by [[Henry William Rawson Wade|Sir William Wade]] as "revolutionary",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Wade | first = Sir William | authorlink = Henry William Rawson Wade |author2=Forsyth, Christopher  | title = Administrative Law | year = 2000 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = Oxford  | isbn = 978-0-19-876525-7 | page = 28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in that Lord Bridge suggests that Parliament has, in passing the European Communities Act 1972, managed to bind its successors from repealing the Act impliedly. It had previously been thought that no parliament could ever bind its successors in such a way. In a case where two statutes conflicted, the traditional approach would have been to apply the later statute on the basis that the inconsistent parts of the earlier statute had been repealed.

Such an interpretation of the case is supported by statements in ''[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council]]'' and ''[[Hunt v Hackney Borough Council]]'' to the effect that there now exist two forms of Acts of Parliament: ordinary acts which can be repealed impliedly, and "statutory" or "constitutional" acts which can only be repealed expressly. (See in particular the judgment of Laws LJ in ''Thoburn''.) Nevertheless, there is no restriction on the ability of Parliament to expressly repeal the European Communities Act 1972.

Furthermore, the case does not, on a strict reading, constitute a breach of parliamentary sovereignty. The Merchant Shipping Act 1988 was not a purposeful and direct conflict with EC law, but was instead an attempt to give effect to the fishing quotas required under EC law. Therefore, the courts were not striking down a domestic Act of Parliament, but were instead attempting to interpret legislation in a manner compatible with the Treaty obligations that arise under the European Communities Act 1972 (as proposed by [[Lord Diplock]] in the case of ''[[Garland v British Rail Engineering]]''). It remains to be seen how the courts would respond to an Act of Parliament intentionally contradicting EC law. However, in the case of ''[[Macarthys v Smith]]'', [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] suggested that, should such an event occur, the courts would be obliged to obey the domestic law over the European.

==''Factortame II'' compatibility==
On 25 July 1991 the ECJ gave its ruling in case C-221/89 on the question referred by the High Court,&lt;ref&gt;{{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1991:320}}, 2nd ECJ decision in re Factortame.  David Vaughan, Gerald Barling, David Anderson, and Stephen Swabey for the Applicant, Timothy J.G. Pratt, Sir [[Nicholas Lyell]], [[Christopher Bellamy]], [[Christopher Vajda]], and [[Andrew Macnab]] for the Respondent, and six national governments plus the [[European Commission]]. Opinion [[Advocate-General]]: {{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1991:113}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely whether the conditions for registration of fishing vessels under the 1988 Act were compatible with Community law. Agreeing with Advocate-General [[Jean Mischo|Mischo]]'s opinion, the court (sitting as the full court of 11 justices) en banc held that "it is for the Member States to determine ... the conditions which must be fulfilled in order for a vessel to be registered in their registers and granted the right to fly their flag, but, in exercising that power, the Member States must comply with the rules of Community law". In particular, the conditions for registration should not constitute obstacles for nationals of one Member State to establish themselves in business in the territory of another Member State (the freedom of establishment), nor should they discriminate on the basis of nationality.

In the event, the ECJ found the nationality requirements in the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 discriminatory and contrary to Article 43 EC as a restriction on the freedom of establishment. It also violated articles 12 and 221 EC. The residence and domicile conditions also breached Article 43. In effect, by introducing a requirement based on an individual's residence and domicile, the Act operated an unfair distinction between UK nationals and those from other Member States as "the great majority of nationals of the [UK] are resident and domiciled in that State and therefore meet that requirement automatically, whereas nationals of other Member States would, in most cases, have to move their residence and domicile to [the UK] in order to comply with the requirements of [the 1988 Act]". In respect of the condition that the vessel should be managed and its operations directed from the UK, the ECJ found, however, that this requirement was compatible with Community law.

The UK government had argued that the conditions imposed by the 1988 Act were justified on the basis that the [[Common Fisheries Policy]] allowed for a system of national quotas and the 1988 Act ensured the effectiveness of that system. This was rejected by the ECJ which stated that fishing vessel registration criteria were permitted, but not where they violated Community law. It was, in that respect, open to the UK government to introduce conditions ensuring that a "real economic link" existed between the ship and the State of registration, but such a link had to "concern only the relations between the vessel's operations and the population dependent on fisheries and related industries". In other words, it would have been possible for the UK government to prescribe conditions which protected UK fishing communities from the effects of the opening up of national fishing waters to other Member States, but it could not do that through the imposition of explicit nationality and residence conditions.

==''Factortame III'' state liability==
{{main|Brasserie du Pêcheur v Germany}}
Following the ECJ's second ruling, the case returned once more to the High Court which, on 18 November 1992, requested a third ruling from ECJ concerning the conditions under which a member state may incur liability for damage caused to individuals by breaches of Community law attributable to that state. At around the same time the [[Bundesgerichtshof|German Federal Court]] had asked for a ruling on a similar question in the case of ''[[Brasserie du Pêcheur v Bundesrepublik Deutschland]]'' and so the two cases (C46/93 and C48/93) were joined.

At this time the ECJ had just delivered judgment in ''[[Francovich principle|Francovich]]'' ({{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1991:428}}), which established the principle that "a State must be liable for loss and damage caused to individuals as a result of breaches of Community law". The Factortame case provided the court for an opportunity to elaborate on the principles underlying the liability of member states. It was a case in which almost all member states intervened to deny, whether wholly or substantially, the right to claim damages; the UK accepted that there was, in principle, such a right. The EC Treaty does not deal expressly with the consequences of a breach of Community law by a member state, and so it was for the court to rule on the question having regard to "the fundamental principles of the Community legal system and, where necessary, general principles common to the legal systems of the Member States".

In its judgment delivered on 5 March 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1996:79}}, Joined Cases C-46/93 and C-48/93: Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Federal Republic of Germany; and The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte Factortame Ltd and Others" 5 Mar 1996. Tesauro, AG; 6 other EU member state governments; the [[European Commission]], 8 lawyers for 97 Claimants, and [[J.E. Collins]], [[Stephen Richards (judge)|Stephen Richards]], [[Christopher Vajda]] and [[Rhodri Thompson]] for the Respondent.&lt;/ref&gt; the court of nine justices ''en banc'' reaffirmed the right of reparation, and stated that it existed irrespective of whether the provision of Community law in question has direct effect. Furthermore, the principle applies to any case where a member state breaches Community law, irrespective of which organ of the state was responsible for the breach. The ECJ rejected the contentions that the right to reparation required the introduction of legislation by the EU, and that the availability of damages should be decided, in each case, on the basis of the national law of the state in question.

The court proceeded to outline the conditions on which liability would be established. It underlined that such conditions could not, in the absence of a particular justification, differ from the conditions applicable to the liability of the Community in similar circumstances. Further, the right to reparation would depend on the nature of the breach of Community law in question and the extent of the discretion available to the State in question. The conditions are:

# the rule of law infringed must be intended to confer rights on individuals;
# the breach must be sufficiently serious;
# there must be a direct causal link between the breach of the obligation and the damage sustained by the injured party.

In the case where a state had exercised broad discretion in passing legislation which breached Community law (as was the case in Factortame), for the breach to be "sufficiently serious" it must be "manifest" and "grave". National courts have jurisdiction to decide how to characterise the breach in question, taking into account the clarity and precision of the Community rule infringed, whether the damage was intentional or involuntary, whether any error of law was excusable, and whether a Community institution contributed towards the adoption or maintenance of contrary national measures or practices. These same conditions apply to state liability for damage caused by the decision of a judicial body adjudicating at last instance.

==''Factortame IV'' right to damages==
The matter came back to the Divisional Court ([[John Hobhouse, Baron Hobhouse of Woodborough|Hobhouse LJ]], [[Lawrence Collins|Collins J]] and Moses LJ) which ruled on 31 July 1997 that HMG had committed a sufficiently serious breach of Community law in passing the offending provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988, and that that breach gave rise to damage for which Factortame should be compensated. The court rejected a claim by Factortame for [[exemplary damages]]. The decision was appealed by HMG to the Court of Appeal ([[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|Lord Woolf MR]], [[Konrad Schiemann|Schiemann LJ]] and [[Robert Walker, Baron Walker of Gestingthorpe|Walker LJ]]) which rejected the appeal on 8 April 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/75815.stm|title=BBC News - EUROPE - Spanish win legal fish fight|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; HMG appealed again to the House of Lords ([[Gordon Slynn, Baron Slynn of Hadley|Lord Slynn]], [[Donald Nicholls, Baron Nicholls of Birkenhead|Lord Nicholls]], Lord Hoffmann, [[James Clyde, Baron Clyde|Lord Clyde]] and [[David Hope, Baron Hope of Craighead|Lord Hope]]).

The House of Lords unanimously ruled in favour of Factortame on 28 October 1999. It rejected the argument that HMG's reliance on legal advice at the time of passing the 1988 Act did not deprive the breach of its grave and manifest character. The court did accept, however, that the government had acted in good faith in passing the Act. Nevertheless, the government had been aware of the risk it was running with such legislation and it had done everything possible to ensure that fishermen could not obtain interim relief against the Act's application. The case would now go back to the Divisional Court for the amount of damages to be determined.

In March 2000, Factortame and the other claimants (approximately 90 Anglo-Spanish fishing companies) accepted an offer of settlement from the Secretary of State. Under the terms of the settlement the claimants, who had originally claimed £285 million, received £55 million including interest of some £26 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010208/text/10208w02.htm |title=House of Lords, Hansard Debates, 8 February 2001 |accessdate=2008-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Factortame V'' limitation issues==
On 27 November 2000, Judge Toulmin in the [[Technology and Construction Court]] (a division of the High Court) held, under the [[Limitation Act 1980]], Factortame's claims against the UK government were "actions founded on tort", and that consequently a six-year limitation period applied. This meant that other claims against the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 would only be admissible if they had been lodged by 10 July 1996 (i.e. six years from the House of Lords' decision of 9 July 1990 granting Factortame interim relief), otherwise such claims were statute-barred. The judge therefore rejected claims by Factortame in respect of other fishing vessels which had been refused registration under the 1988 Act, but which had not formed part of the original claim lodged in 1988, nor had been claimed before July 1996.

The judge also rejected an attempt by Factortame to obtain damages for [[Measure of damages under English law#Special classes of damages|injury to feelings]] and aggravated damages caused by HMG's breach of Community law. Factortame had argued that claims for discrimination under European law were broadly comparable to claims for discrimination to individuals under the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]. This was not accepted by Judge Toulmin who emphasised that such damages were only awarded in cases where the breach in question had caused harm to the claimant's self-esteem.

==Significance==
The ''Factortame'' case has produced large amounts of academic debate as to whether it can be reconciled with the idea of legislative supremacy as stated by [[A. V. Dicey|Dicey]]. [[Henry William Rawson Wade|Sir William Wade]] argues that the Factortame judgment alters the [[Rule of Recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sovereignty - Evolution or Revolution?|journal=[[Law Quarterly Review]]|year=1996|first=Sir William|last=Wade|authorlink=Henry William Rawson Wade|volume=112|issue=|page=574|id= |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of whether the UK Parliament or the European Court of Justice has ultimate sovereignty over European Community laws which apply to the UK is still an area of intense legal debate and conflicting views. In current practice, the UK recognises the primacy of the European Court of Justice for those areas of law in which the EU has competency. However, in ''[[Macarthys Ltd v Smith]]'', Lord Denning MR said, "If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act—with the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision in it—or intentionally of acting inconsistently with it—and says so in express terms—then ... it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute of our Parliament."&lt;ref&gt;Lord Denning in ''Macarthys Ltd v Smith'' [1979] ICR 785 at p. 789, quoted in {{cite book | last = Steiner | first = Josephine |author2=Lorna Woods |author3=Christian Twigg-Flesner  | title = EU Law  | edition = 9th  | year = 2006  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | location = Oxford, New York  | isbn = 978-0-19-927959-3|chapter=Section 4.4.2: Effect of the European Communities Act 1972, s.2(1) and (4) |quote=If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act    with the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision in it   or intentionally of acting inconsistently with it—and says so in express terms—then ... it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute of our Parliament. |page=79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmeuleg/38-xiv/5020802.htm| title = Select Committee on European Scrutiny Minutes of Evidence: Examination of Witnesses (Questions 229-239): Rt hon Jack Straw MP and Mr David Frost| accessdate =2008-01-09 | author = Jack Straw MP| authorlink = Jack Straw| date = 2005-02-08| work = House of Commons Publications|quote = I think your Committee will be familiar with what Lord Denning, then Master of the Rolls, said in ''[[McCarthy v Smith]]'': "If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act with the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision of it or with the intention of acting inconsistently with it—it says so in express terms—I should have thought it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute in our Parliament." That much is clear. Other consequences would follow in those circumstances, which arise from our signature on the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaty, Article 27, which says that you have to respect the international obligations into which you have entered.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of the UK's ultimate sovereignty was supported by [[John Laws (judge)|Lord Justice Laws]] in the ''[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council]]'' case, when he said that "there is nothing in the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act]] which allows the European Court, or any other institution of the EU, to touch or qualify the conditions of Parliament's legislative supremacy in the United Kingdom ... That being so, the legislative and judicial institutions of the EU cannot intrude upon those conditions."

That European law has primacy over UK law has been stated many times in European courts. In ECJ Case 6/64 ''[[Costa v ENEL]]'' (1964), the ECJ stated that "the Members States have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields". In Case 26/62 ''[[Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen]]'' (1963) their ruling states that "the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights".

The question of who has the ultimate ''[[kompetenz-kompetenz]]'' (i.e. the right to decide the limits the European Court of Justice's jurisdiction) has not been settled.

'''Richard John Pelwana Maponya''', [[Order of the Baobab|GCOB]],&lt;ref name="gcob"&gt;[http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/orders_list.asp?show=343 The Presidency - Republic of South Africa - Grand Counsellor of The Order of the Baobab in Gold]&lt;/ref&gt; (born in [[Tzaneen]],[[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] on 24 December 1926&lt;ref name="gcob" /&gt;) is a [[South Africa]]n entrepreneur and [[property developer]] best known for building a business empire despite the restrictions of [[apartheid]] and his determination to see the [[Soweto]] township develop [[economics|economically]].

==Early career==
Born  in Thlabine, near Lenyenye- about 20km west of Tzaneen, Maponya, at the age of 24,&lt;ref name="age"&gt;zwtetete [https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081004/ap_on_re_af/af_south_africa_soweto_entrepreneur Up from apartheid, Soweto millionaire a role model - AP]&lt;/ref&gt;  then a teacher, took a job as a stock taker at a clothing maker and subsequently won a promotion for both himself and his white manager. In gratitude, the manager sold Maponya soiled clothing and offcuts, which he resold in Soweto. With the capital acquired he attempted to open a clothing retailer in Soweto, but was blocked by the government's refusal to grant him a licence – despite the intervention by the law firm created by [[Oliver Tambo]] and [[Nelson Mandela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1657164,00.html|title=Retail Renegade: Richard Maponya|publisher=Time magazine|accessdate=7 July 2008 | date=29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, in the early 1950s, Maponya and his wife Marina (a cousin of Nelson Mandela) established the [[Dube Hygienic Dairy]], which employed a fleet of boys on bicycles to deliver milk to customers in Soweto who had no access to electricity or refrigeration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Soweto Rising, [[Maverick (magazine)|Maverick magazine]], volume 2, issue 2&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s the retail empire had grown to include several general stores, car dealerships and filling stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1657164-2,00.html|title=Retail Renegade: Richard Maponya|publisher=Time magazine|accessdate=7 July 2008 | date=29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activity==
During the 1960s and 1970s Maponya was a member of the [[South Africa under apartheid|Urban Bantu Council]]. He resigned in 1977, shortly after youth affiliated with the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) requested that he do so, and shortly before the council offices were burnt to the ground.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In the 1960s he was a founding member and the first president of the [[National African Federated Chamber of Commerce]] (Nafcoc) and likewise the founder and chairman of the [[African Chamber of Commerce]].

But some consider his boldest political move to have been his choice of horse-racing colors. As the first black person to be granted such colors in South Africa, Maponya chose green, gold and black, the colors of the ANC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2005-08-17-i-will-die-with-my-boots-on|title='I will die with my boots on'|publisher=Mail &amp; Guardian|accessdate=7 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maponya Mall==
On 27 September 2007 Richard Maponya opened the [[Maponya Mall]] in Soweto. it holds more than 200 stores and a cinema complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/general/0,2172,156535,00.html|title=Mandela officially opens new Soweto mall|publisher=SABC|accessdate=7 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maponya acquired the land where the mall is situated in 1979, at first as a 100-year lease. In 1994, after several attempts, he acquired it outright. Various attempts to finance construction failed until Maponya's holding company entered into a joint venture with [[Zenprop Property Holdings]].

He is currently chairman and founder of Conlon &amp; Co, CONLON/Christie's International Real Estate, CONLON Commercial and Conlon Capital. He is a co-host of ''The Deed'', an unscripted television series focused on real estate investing on [[CNBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/03/cnbc-announces-fall-lineup.html|title=CNBC ANNOUNCES FALL LINE UP|date=3 August 2017|website=CNBC.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Conlon was born in [[Birmingham, England]] to Irish parents and raised in [[Rathangan, County Kildare]], [[Ireland]]. Before migrating to America in 1990, Conlon attended the [[Dublin Institute of Technology|College of Marketing and Design, Dublin]] and worked as a credit analyst for Lehman Brothers in London.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

===Business career===
In 1993, he joined Koenig &amp; Strey and within a few years, Sean became recognized as one of the leading sellers of residential real estate in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://realtormag.realtor.org/sales-and-marketing/success-stories/article/2000/06/top-performer-sean-conlon|title=Top Performer: Sean Conlon|last=Sharoff|first=Robert|website=Realtor Magazine|language=en|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He set yearly sales records nationally among real estate agents that exceeded $150 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://realtormag.realtor.org/sales-and-marketing/success-stories/article/2000/06/top-performer-sean-conlon|title=Top Performer: Sean Conlon|last=Sharoff|first=Robert|website=Realtor Magazine|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conlon made his name buying small homes and replacing them with three-story [[condominium]]s and [[single family homes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://realtormag.realtor.org/sales-and-marketing/success-stories/article/2000/06/top-performer-sean-conlon|title=Top Performer: Sean Conlon|last=Sharoff|first=Robert|website=Realtor Magazine|accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Previously in [[Chicago]], builders created developments and brought them to [[estate agent]]s who sold them, but Conlon devised a new formula where he found the land, architect, builders and then marketed the entire project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://conlonandco.com/node/38|title=Birth of a Salesman|last=Allen|first=Ted|date=1 February 1998|work=Chicago Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2000, Conlon formed Sussex &amp; Reilly ("Sussex"), an Illinois-based real estate brokerage firm. The firm began with a 10-person staff and quickly became a major player in Chicago residential real estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://realtormag.realtor.org/for-brokers/feature/article/2001/06/brokers-breaking-ground|title="Brokers Breaking Ground"|last=Sharoff|first=Robert|date=June 2001|work=Realtor Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sussex grew to over 300 employees and annual brokerage sales volume in excess of $1 billion. He subsequently sold Sussex in 2006. Since 2002, Conlon has been a partner of Van &amp; Conlon, which has built and developed 100 vacation homes. In 2004, in partnership, he acquired Near North National Title, which was established in 1988, and handles up to $5 billion in real estate transactions annually across the US. He sold Near North in February 2010. In 2005, Sean launched Connaught Real Estate Finance, a $100 million mezzanine fund that lends money to developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagoagentmagazine.com/current-issue/vol-10-2013/whos-who-2013/steve-horvath-and-sean-conlon|title=Steve Horvath and Sean Conlon - Chicago Agent Magazine|website=Chicagoagentmagazine.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagorealestatedaily.com/article/20130716/CRED0701/130719877?template=mobile&amp;X-IgnoreUserAgent=1|title=Conlon seeks boost from Christie's brand|website=Chicagorealestatedaily.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.chicagotribune.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-77629469|title=Chicago Tribune|website=My.chicagotribune.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=27047|title=Irish investors buying local retail properties|website=Chicagobusiness.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, he returned to residential real estate brokerage. In June 2013, CONLON became affiliated with one of the world’s real estate networks, [[Christie's International Real Estate|Christie’s International Real Estate]].  [[Christie's]] is one of the oldest privately held brands in the world. Their International Real Estate division specializes in high-end properties and has offices worldwide, including London, Sydney, Italy, New York and Hong Kong, and Chicago. CONLON is the Christie’s exclusive affiliate in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?play=1&amp;video=3000203923|title=Tour multi-million dollar homes in Dallas, Chicago|website=CNBC|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/kapos-chicagos-celebrity-house-flipper|title=Kapos: Chicago's celebrity house-flipper|website=Chicago.suntimes.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television Personality===
In November 2016, [[CNBC]] announced that Sean would be the co-host of its newest show ''[[The Deed]]'' which premiered in March 2017.

'''Shaul Elovitch''' ({{Lang-he|שאול אלוביץ'}}; born 1949, [[Poland]]) - a Polish-born Israeli businessman and the owner of Eurocom Group, one of the largest private [[holding company|holding groups]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurocom Group|url=http://www.bdicode.co.il/CodeFiles/Company/profiles/Eurocom_eng.pdf|work=[[Coface]]|publisher=BdiCoface|accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Shaul Elovitch was born in 1949 in [[Poland]] and made [[aliyah]] to [[Israel]] when he was two years old. He grew up in [[Tel Aviv]] and married at the age of 20. In 1968, shortly after completing his military service, he joined his father-in-law's small business of installing [[intercom]]s and [[television antenna]]s and importing telephones. For a time he studied law but did not complete the requirements for the degree, preferring instead to devote himself to his business pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sadeh|first=Shuki|script-title=he:משכיר לאימפריה: המסלול העסקי של שאול אלוביץ'|url=http://www.themarker.com/markets/1.539795|accessdate=14 November 2011|newspaper=[[TheMarker]]|date=28 August 2009|language=Hebrew|trans-title=From employee to empire: the corporate path of Shaul Elovitch|quote=הוא גדל בתל אביב הקטנה של שנות ה-50 וה-60, ובימי נעוריו החל לצאת עם מירה פרונאי, שעמה התחתן בגיל צעיר.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peretz|first=Gad|title=10 דברים שלא ידעתם על שאול אלוביץ'|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000508110|accessdate=14 November 2011|newspaper=[[Globes]]|date=25 October 2009|language=Hebrew|trans-title=10 things you never knew about Shaul Elovitch|quote=אלוביץ' למד משפטים, אך לא השלים את התואר כי העדיף להתרכז בניהול ר.א.פ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From R.A.P. to Eurocom ==
As manager of his father-in-law's company, R.A.P., the young Elovitch was also involved in the distribution of products by a telephone manufacturing company called Eurocom. Eurocom was established in 1979 to take the place of a telephone plant that had operated with Israeli partnership in Iran until [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatolla Khomeini]]'s rise to power. In 1985, Elovitch acquired Eurocom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shaul Alovitz - Eurocom|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=380728|accessdate=15 November 2011|newspaper=[[Globes]]|date=19 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partnering with [[Tadiran]], Elovitch became the exclusive distributor in Israel of [[Panasonic]]'s line of office appliances, including telephones, fax machines, xerox machines, and printers, through Eurocom Marketing (1986) Ltd. Next, in 1993, Elovitch signed a distribution deal with [[Nokia]] making him their exclusive distributor in Israel. A year later [[Cellcom (Israel)|Cellcom]] entered Israel's cellular network arena and became a client of Eurocom's Nokia phones, and together the two rivaled [[Pelephone]]'s Motorola-based dominance of Israel's mobile phone market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurz|first=Amir|script-title=he:סתם, כי בא לו לדבר|url=http://www.calcalist.co.il/local/articles/0,7340,L-3416854,00.html|accessdate=17 November 2011|newspaper=[[Calcalist]]|date=6 September 2010|language=Hebrew|trans-title=For no reason other than he likes to talk|quote=אלוביץ', עם תדיראן שנכנסה איתו אז כשותפה ב־50%, החל לשווק בארץ באופן בלעדי מוצרים של פנסוניק היפנית באמצעות יורוקום שיווק: טלפונים, מרכזיות, פקסימיליות, מכונות צילום, מדפסות, מחשבים וכו'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bezeq acquisition ==
After various attempts to establish himself in Israel's communication sector since the late 1990s, including a failed move to compete with [[Bezeq]] through a company named Ofek, in 2009 it was reported that Shaul Elovitch was seriously contemplating the acquisition of either Bezeq or [[Partner Communications Company]]. Later that year it was announced that Elovitch had opted for a deal with the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eurocom's Elovitch mulls Bezeq or Partner acquisition|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2009/05/31/4203645.htm|accessdate=15 November 2011|newspaper=TMCnet.com|date=31 May 2009|agency=[[Globes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elovitch's straight flush|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10003917/1/elovitchs-straight-flush.html|accessdate=25 November 2011|newspaper=[[TheStreet.com]]|date=13 November 2001|agency=[[TheMarker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Teig|first=Amir|title=Elovitch to buy Bezeq|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/elovitch-to-buy-bezeq-1.5544|accessdate=15 November 2011|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=23 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April 2010 the ownership of Bezeq was transferred from the Apax-[[Haim Saban|Saban]]-Arkin group to an indirect subsidiary of Eurocom, [[B Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=B Communications Closes Acquisition Of Controlling Interest In Bezeq - Quick Facts|url=http://www.rttnews.com/content/BreakingNews.aspx?Id=1268972|accessdate=15 November 2011|newspaper=[[RTTNews]]|date=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spacecom ==
Spacecom Satellite Communications Ltd. (TASE:SCC) was launched in 1993 and is the operator of Amos communication satellites in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/1.693292|title=Israeli satellite operator Spacecom on the selling block again|website=haaretz.com|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has a market cap of NIS 1,1 billion on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. In 2015, Spacecom lost contact with AMOS 5, their Russian-built satellite causing a loss of over one third of total company revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Business-and-Innovation/Tech/Israeli-satellite-company-loses-contact-with-satellite-suffers-heavy-losses-in-stock-exchange-434921|title=Israeli satellite company loses contact with satellite, suffers heavy losses in stock exchange|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company, owned by Eurocom and controlled by Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication Co. Ltd. (TASE: BEZQ) has been on the market since 2013. Share prices in the group rose after Elovitch announced an offer from a foreign investor of $285 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-foreign-co-in-talks-to-buy-spacecom-for-285m-1001147819|title=Foreign co in talks to buy Spacecom for $285m - Globes English|website=Globes|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Total benefits of ownership (TBO)''' is a calculation that tries to summarise the positive effects of the acquisition of a [[Business plan|plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.auditmypc.com/tbo.asp|title = TBO Definitions|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-01|website = |publisher = Audit My PC|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an estimate of all the values that will affect a business. It is a financial estimate intended to help buyers and owners determine the direct and indirect benefits of a product or system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.asiaonline.net/EN/LanguageStudio/BenefitsROIAndTCO.aspx|title = Understanding Return On Investment (ROI) and Total Cost and Benefit of Ownership (TCBO)|date = |accessdate = 2015-10-28|website = Understanding Return On Investment (ROI) and Total Cost and Benefit of Ownership (TCBO)|publisher = Asia Online|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to determine potential [[Return On Investment|Return on Investment]] (ROI). The usage of TBO may lead to increase in efficiency and productivity of a business, improvements in decision-making or improvements in the workforce. It helps to identify important areas which a business should be focusing on, as well as uncovering the hidden aspects of the decisions made by the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/definition/total-benefit-of-ownership-TBO|title = total benefit of ownership (TBO) definition|date = |accessdate = 2015-10-30|website = |publisher = TechTarget|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of concept ==
TBO goes beyond the initial purpose or implementation benefit to consider the full benefit of a decision or an asset over its [[Product lifetime|useful life]]. A TBO analysis often shows there can be a large difference between the short term benefit to the business and its long term benefit. This can include [[Operating cost|operational cost]] savings, productivity improvements, enhancements to a business’s ability to compete, greater [[employee retention]], increased [[brand equity]] and expanding sales reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.fuzebox.com/files/pdf/whitepapers/TCO.pdf|title = Analysing Your web conferencing: Total Cost of Ownership|date = |accessdate = 2015-10-30|website = |publisher = fuzebox|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a small company can now have access to the rest of the world's markets without the costs of travel. The decisions made from TBO analysis help adding monetary profit into the company's account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7FRGdB4EVg|title = How to show Total Benefits of Ownership [tm]|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-01|website = |publisher = Senior Advisory Group|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance of TBO ==
While many companies perform [[Total Cost of Ownership]] (TCO) analysis, TBO is considered to be as important as TCO. TCO aims to minimise the total cost of the business, whereas TBO targets the maximum value of the project. Enterprise decision makers often use both methods to estimate the actual value of an investment or strategic venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3450060/Hart_CostsBenefits.pdf?sequence=4|title = The Costs and Benefits of Ownership: A Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-02|website = |publisher = Harvard University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When considering a business proposition, the enterprise decision makers always consider other alternatives while deciding whether the original plan is the best. An advantage of using TBO is that it identifies the value of the short term and the long-term benefits of the propositions. This system helps the company to prioritise the importance of each decision. This analysis not only serves as a tool to reduce cost but also as a way to plan the future of the business, in a more detailed and sophisticated way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11740-011-0313-2|title = Linking total costs and benefits of ownership (TCBO) and process chain simulation for integrated assessment of manufacturing technologies and processes|date = |accessdate = 2015-10-28|doi=10.1007/s11740-011-0313-2|volume=5|pages=557–564 | last1 = Denkena | first1 = B. |journal=Production Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a company is considering whether to invest in a long-term project, such as [[infrastructure]]. TBO will consider whether the long-term benefit may outweigh the short-term benefits of [[opportunity cost]]; whether the money spent on investment may have a better alternate purpose, e.g. using the budget to improve training schemes for workers.

== Examples of different industries using Total Benefits of Ownership ==

=== Retailing industry with the use of Internet ===
The TBO concept is widely used within the web industry. For example, TBO identifies the benefits of using the Internet in a business. These include the exclusion of fixed cost (i.e. rent), as well as the decreasing cost of online advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wilsonmar.com/1tco.htm|title = Total Cost and Benefit of Ownership (TCBO)|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-04|website = |publisher = WilsonMar|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the key elements incorporated in the benefit of ownership within retailing industry. 
* Cheaper transportation cost
* Increase in global demand for products
* Decrease in variable cost ( i.e. cheaper wages)
* Benefits of outsourcing

=== Computer and software industries etc&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nashnetworks.ca/total-cost-of-ownership-tco-of-it.htm|title = Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of IT|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-02|website = Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of IT|publisher = Nash Networks Inc|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
* Software becomes more user-friendly
* Quicker data analysis
* Greater data storage space

'''William Baxter''' (4 December 1911 – 20 April 1979) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician, building contractor and farmer.

He was a [[conscientious objector]] in the [[Second World War]].

Having served as a councillor, he was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[West Stirlingshire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Stirlingshire]] from [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959]] until he stood down at the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 general election]].

He was asked to stand down by his [[Constituency Labour Party]] after the indecisive [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|election of February 1974]], when he appeared on television calling for an all-party government of national unity, and suggested that the [[Duke of Edinburgh]] could chair its meetings.

In 1961, as a protest against [[bipartisan]] support for British [[nuclear weapons]], he voted against the [[Royal Air Force]], [[Royal Navy]], and [[British Army]] Estimates in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and was suspended from the Labour [[Party Whip]] from March 1961 until May 1963.

Baxter received an [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctorate]] from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 1976 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-graduates.htm|title=Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: Honorary Graduates|last=webperson@hw.ac.uk|website=www1.hw.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
