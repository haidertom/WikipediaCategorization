      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2958">[[File:Acid Egg Catalyst 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Acid Egg on display at the Catalyst Museum, 2011]]
The terms '''acid egg''' and '''montejus''' (or '''monte-jus''') are sometimes used interchangeably to refer to a device with no moving parts formerly used instead of a pump in order to transfer difficult liquids.&lt;ref name=Schaschke&gt;Carl Schaschke (2014) ''Dictionary of Chemical Engineering'' (Oxford University Press) p 245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Killeffer&gt;D. H. Killeffer (1924) ''Industrial and Engineering Chemistry'' Vol. 16, No. 8 pp 785&amp;ndash;8 “Tools of the Chemical Engineer”&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is that a strong vessel containing the liquid is pressurized with gas or steam, forcing the liquid into a pipe (usually vertical upwards) thereby causing flow.  When the liquid has been transferred, the pressure is released and more liquid is put in via gravity.  It is thus cyclic in operation. The same principle has been used to lift water and called an ''air displacement pump'' or ''intermittent gas-lift pump'', and has been applied to pumping oil up from the formation.&lt;ref name=Shell&gt;R. J. Forbes &amp; D. R. O'Beirne (1957) ''The Technical Development of the Royal Dutch/Shell: 1890-1940'' p233&lt;/ref&gt;
Its use has largely been superseded by modern pumps, but it is still used sometimes for special tasks.

==Acid Egg==
This was specifically devised to deal with the highly corrosive [[sulfuric acid]], but was extended to other corrosive substances. It was traditionally made of ceramic (to be corrosion resistant) and spherical in shape (to withstand the pressure) thus giving its name.&lt;ref name=MW&gt;''Miriam-Webster Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;
A cylindrical version (with hemispherical ends) was described by Swindin, being 3 feet in diameter and 6 feet long, holding 40 cubic feet of acid.&lt;ref name=Swindin&gt;Swindin, N., (1922) ''Pumps in Chemical Engineering'' (Benn, London) pp 48&amp;ndash;9&lt;/ref&gt;
In principle, the vessel is part filled with liquid, which is then expelled by pumping in compressed air.  The liquid outlet is via a pipe from the top going down almost to the bottom of the vessel.  When the acid egg is emptied, connections to the compressor and the delivery pipe are closed by valves, the air pressure is vented and the vessel refilled with acid.  The cycle can then start again.&lt;ref name=Swindin/&gt;

==Montejus==
A French invention used in [[Sugar#Production|sugar production]] to move the partially processed sugar liquid up a pipe to the next stage of purification.  Hence the name “monte-jus” or “raise juice”. Unlike the acid egg, it traditionally consists of a vertical cylindrical vessel made of steel, with a pipe from the bottom turned upwards, and it is pressurized by steam.&lt;ref name=SciAm1868Ap24&gt;[[Scientific American]], April 24, 1869 pp 261&amp;ndash;2, “Beet Root Sugar part V”&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British Airways in TXL.jpg|thumb|A [[British Airways]] A320 at Berlin Tegel.]]An '''airline''' is a company that provides [[civil aviation|air transport services]] for traveling [[passenger]]s and [[freight]]. Airlines utilize [[aircraft]] to supply these services and may form [[partnership]]s or [[Airline alliance|alliances]] with other airlines for [[codeshare agreement]]s. Generally, airline companies are recognized with an [[Air operator's certificate|air operating certificate]] or license issued by a governmental aviation body.

Airlines vary in size, from small domestic airlines to full-service international airlines with double decker airplanes. Airline services can be categorized as being intercontinental, domestic, regional, or international, and may be operated as scheduled services or [[Air charter|charters]]. The [[World's largest airlines|largest airline]] currently is [[American Airlines Group]].

==History==
===The first airlines===
[[DELAG]], ''Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-Aktiengesellschaft I'' was the [[List of airlines by foundation|world's first airline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.airships.net/delag-passenger-zeppelins |title=DELAG: The World's First Airline |publisher=Airships.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded on November 16, 1909, with government assistance, and operated airships manufactured by The [[Zeppelin|Zeppelin Corporation]]. Its headquarters were in [[Frankfurt]]. The first fixed wing scheduled air service was started on January 1, 1914, from [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], to [[Tampa, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/16657-worlds-first-commercial-airline-the-greatest-moments-in-flight.html|title=World’s First Commercial Airline {{!}} The Greatest Moments in Flight|work=Space.com|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four [[List of airlines by foundation|oldest non-dirigible airlines]] that still exist are Netherlands' [[KLM]] (1919),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.klm.com/corporate/en/about-klm/history/index.html|title=History - KLM Corporate|access-date=2017-10-14|language=nl-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia's [[Avianca]] (1919),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviancaholdings.com/en/history|title=History - Avianca Holdings S.A. - www.aviancaholdings.com|website=www.aviancaholdings.com|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's [[Qantas]] (1921),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qantas.com/travel/airlines/history-founders/global/en|title=Founders of Qantas {{!}} Qantas|website=www.qantas.com|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Czech Republic's [[Czech Airlines]] (1923).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csa.cz/cz-en/about-us/|title=About Us {{!}} Czech Airlines|website=ČSA.cz|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European airline industry===
====Beginnings====
[[File:KLM Boeing 777-200ER Closeup PH-BQO YUL.jpg|thumb|Founded on 7 October 1919, [[KLM]] is the [[List of airlines by foundation date|oldest running airline still operating under its original name]].]]
[[File:Tanken van een vliegtuig Airplane provided with fuel.jpg|thumb|The [[Handley Page Type W|Handley Page W.8b]] was used by [[Handley Page Transport]], an early British airline established in 1919.]]
The earliest fixed wing airline in Europe was [[Aircraft Transport and Travel]], formed by [[George Holt Thomas]] in 1916; via a series of takeovers and mergers, this company is an ancestor of modern-day [[British Airways]]. Using a fleet of former military [[Airco DH.4]]A biplanes that had been modified to carry two passengers in the [[fuselage]], it operated relief flights between [[Folkestone]] and [[Ghent]]. On 15 July 1919, the company flew a proving flight across the [[English Channel]], despite a lack of support from the British government. Flown by Lt. H Shaw in an [[Airco DH.9]] between [[RAF Hendon]] and [[Paris – Le Bourget Airport]], the flight took 2 hours and 30 minutes at £21 per passenger.

On 25 August 1919, the company used [[Airco DH.16|DH.16s]] to pioneer a regular service from [[Hounslow Heath Aerodrome]] to Le Bourget, the first regular international service in the world. The airline soon gained a reputation for reliability, despite problems with bad weather, and began to attract European competition. In November 1919, it won the first British civil [[airmail]] contract. Six [[Royal Air Force]] [[Airco DH.9A]] aircraft were lent to the company, to operate the airmail service between [[Hawkinge]] and [[Cologne]]. In 1920, they were returned to the Royal Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;''The Putnam Aeronautical Review'' edited by John Motum, p170 Volume one 1990 Naval Institute Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Other British competitors were quick to follow – [[Handley Page Transport]] was established in 1919 and used the company's converted [[World War One|wartime]] [[Handley Page Type O|Type O/400]] [[bomber]]s with a capacity for 12 passengers,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1961/1961%20-%200055.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; to run a [[London]]-[[Paris]] passenger service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airlinehistory.co.uk/Airline%20History/History1903.asp|title=Airline History 1903 to 1919|website=www.airlinehistory.co.uk|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first French airline was [[Aéropostale (aviation)|Société des lignes Latécoère]], later known as Aéropostale, which started its first service in late 1918 to Spain. The [[Société Générale des Transports Aériens]] was created in late 1919, by the [[Farman]] brothers and the [[Farman F.60 Goliath]] plane flew scheduled services from [[Toussus-le-Noble]] to [[Kenley]], near [[Croydon]], England. Another early French airline was the [[Compagnie des Messageries Aériennes]], established in 1919 by [[Louis-Charles Breguet]], offering a mail and freight service between [[Paris – Le Bourget Airport|Le Bourget Airport]], [[Paris]] and [[Lesquin Airport]], [[Lille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/milestones-of-flight/world/1919.cfm |title=World Aviation in 1919 - Part 1 |publisher=Royal Air Force Museum |accessdate=28 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105130943/http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/milestones-of-flight/world/1919.cfm |archivedate=5 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00007, Berlin, Start eines Junkers-Flugzeuges.jpg|thumb| [[Junkers F.13]] ''D-190'' of [[Junkers Luftverkehr]]]]
The first German airline to use heavier than air aircraft was [[Deutsche Luft-Reederei]] established in 1917 which started operating in February 1919. In its first year, the D.L.R. operated regularly scheduled flights on routes with a combined length of nearly 1000 miles. By 1921 the D.L.R. network was more than 3000&amp;nbsp;km (1865 miles) long, and included destinations in the Netherlands, Scandinavia and the Baltic Republics. Another important German airline was [[Junkers Luftverkehr]], which began operations in 1921. It was a division of the aircraft manufacturer [[Junkers]], which became a separate company in 1924. It operated joint-venture airlines in Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland.

[[File:Klm-poster-1919.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A 1919 advertisement for the Dutch airline [[KLM]]]]
The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] airline [[KLM]] made its first flight in 1920, and is the oldest continuously operating airline in the world. Established by aviator [[Albert Plesman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Directory of Company Histories|year=1999|volume=28|title=Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij, N.V. History| url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/koninklijke-luchtvaart-maatschappij-n-v-history/|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was immediately awarded a "Royal" predicate from [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.klm.com/corporate/en/about-klm/history/index.html|work=KLM Corporate|publisher=KLM|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first flight was from [[Croydon Airport]], [[London]] to [[Amsterdam]], using a leased [[Aircraft Transport and Travel]] [[Airco DH.16|DH-16]], and carrying two British journalists and a number of newspapers. In 1921, KLM started scheduled services.

In [[Finland]], the charter establishing Aero O/Y (now [[Finnair]]) was signed in the city of [[Helsinki]] on September 12, 1923. [[Junkers F.13]] D-335 became the first aircraft of the company, when Aero took delivery of it on March 14, 1924. The first flight was between Helsinki and [[Tallinn]], capital of [[Estonia]], and it took place on March 20, 1924, one week later.

In the [[Soviet Union]], the Chief Administration of the Civil Air Fleet was established in 1921. One of its first acts was to help found Deutsch-Russische Luftverkehrs A.G. (Deruluft), a German-Russian joint venture to provide air transport from Russia to the West. Domestic air service began around the same time, when Dobrolyot started operations on 15 July 1923 between Moscow and Nizhni Novgorod. Since 1932 all operations had been carried under the name [[Aeroflot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aeroflot.ru/us-en/about/history|title=Aeroflot History {{!}} Aeroflot|website=www.aeroflot.ru|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early European airlines tended to favor comfort – the passenger cabins were often spacious with luxurious interiors – over speed and efficiency. The relatively basic navigational capabilities of pilots at the time also meant that delays due to the weather were commonplace.

====Rationalization====
[[File:National Audit Office - Victoria - London - 020504.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|The [[Imperial Airways]] Empire Terminal, Victoria, London. Trains ran from here to [[flying boats]] in [[Southampton]], and to [[Croydon Airport]].]]
By the early 1920s, small airlines were struggling to compete, and there was a movement towards increased rationalization and consolidation. In 1924, [[Imperial Airways]] was formed from the merger of [[Instone Air Line|Instone Air Line Company]], [[British Marine Air Navigation Co Ltd|British Marine Air Navigation]], [[Daimler Airway]] and [[Handley Page Transport|Handley Page Transport Co Ltd.]], to allow British airlines to compete with stiff competition from French and German airlines that were enjoying heavy government subsidies. The airline was a pioneer in surveying and opening up air routes across the world to serve far-flung parts of the [[British Empire]] and to enhance trade and integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1923/1923%20-%200760.html |title = Imperial Air Transport Company: Appointment of Government Directors|work = Flight|date = December 20, 1923|page = 760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first new airliner ordered by Imperial Airways, was the [[Handley Page W8f]] ''City of Washington'', delivered on 3 November 1924.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/coming%20of%20age/imperial%20airways.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the first year of operation the company carried 11,395 passengers and 212,380 letters. In April 1925, the film ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' became the first film to be screened for passengers on a scheduled airliner flight when it was shown on the London-Paris route.

Two French airlines also merged to form [[Air Union]] on 1 January 1923. This later merged with four other French airlines to become [[Air France]], the country's flagship carrier to this day, on 7 October 1933.

Germany's [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]] was created in 1926 by merger of two airlines, one of them [[Junkers Luftverkehr]]. Luft Hansa, due to the [[Hugo Junkers|Junkers]] heritage and unlike most other airlines at the time, became a major investor in airlines outside of Europe, providing capital to [[Varig]] and Avianca. German airliners built by [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]], [[Dornier GmbH|Dornier]], and [[Fokker]] were among the most advanced in the world at the time.

====Global expansion====
In 1926, [[Alan Cobham]] surveyed a flight route from the UK to [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], following this up with another proving flight to [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. Other routes to [[British India]] and the [[Far East]] were also charted and demonstrated at this time. Regular services to [[Cairo]] and [[Basra]] began in 1927 and were extended to [[Karachi]] in 1929. The London-[[Australia]] service was inaugurated in 1932 with the [[Handley Page HP 42]] airliners. Further services were opened up to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[Rangoon]], [[Singapore]], [[Brisbane]] and [[Hong Kong]] passengers departed London on 14 March 1936 following the establishment of a branch from Penang to Hong Kong.

[[File:Imperial routes April 1935.jpg|thumb|left|April 1935 map showing [[Imperial Airways]]' routes from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to [[Australia]] and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]]] Imperial's aircraft were small, most seating fewer than twenty passengers, and catered for the rich. Only about 50,000 passengers used Imperial Airways in the 1930s. Most passengers on intercontinental routes or on services within and between British colonies were men doing colonial administration, business or research.&lt;ref&gt;Pirie, G.H. Incidental tourism: British imperial air travel in the 1930s. ''Journal of Tourism History'', 1 (2009) 49–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Imperial Airways, [[Air France]] and [[KLM]]'s early growth depended heavily on the needs to service links with far-flung colonial possessions ([[French North Africa|North Africa]] and [[French Indochina|Indochina]] for the French and the [[Dutch Indies|East Indies]] for the Dutch). France began an air mail service to [[Morocco]] in 1919 that was bought out in 1927, renamed [[Aéropostale (aviation)|Aéropostale]], and injected with capital to become a major international carrier. In 1933, Aéropostale went [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]], was nationalized and merged into [[Air France]].

Although Germany lacked colonies, it also began expanding its services globally. In 1931, the airship [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]] began offering regular scheduled passenger service between Germany and South America, usually every two weeks, which continued until 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airships.net/lz127-graf-zeppelin/history |title=LZ-127 Graf Zeppelin |publisher=Airships.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the airship [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] entered passenger service and successfully crossed the Atlantic 36 times before crashing at Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airships.net/hindenburg |title=Hindenburg |publisher=Airships.net |date=2009-06-10 |accessdate=2010-08-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101005073820/http://www.airships.net/hindenburg| archivedate= 5 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From February 1934 until World War II began in 1939 [[Deutsche Luft Hansa|Deutsche Lufthansa]] operated an airmail service from [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] via [[Spain]], the [[Canary Islands]] and West Africa to [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]] in [[Brazil]]. This was the first time an airline flew across an ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pigDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1931+plane#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Science%201931%20plane&amp;f=true |title=First Transatlantic Air Line Links Two Continents|date=February 1933 |journal=Popular Science|pages = 13-15 and 104|volume = 122|issue = 2|editor-last = Brown|editor-first = Raymond J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graue&amp;Duggan"&gt;James W. Graue &amp; John Duggan "Deutsche Lufthansa South Atlantic Airmail Service 1934–1939", Zeppelin Study Group, Ickenham, UK 2000 {{ISBN|0-9514114-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 1930s [[Aeroflot]] had become the world's largest airline, employing more than 4,000 pilots and 60,000 other service personnel and operating around 3,000 aircraft (of which 75% were considered obsolete by its own standards). During the Soviet era Aeroflot was synonymous with Russian civil aviation, as it was the only air carrier. It became the first airline in the world to operate sustained regular jet services on 15 September 1956 with the [[Tupolev Tu-104]].

====EU airline deregulation====
Deregulation of the [[European Union]] airspace in the early 1990s has had substantial effect on the structure of the industry there. The shift towards 'budget' airlines on shorter routes has been significant. Airlines such as [[EasyJet]] and [[Ryanair]] have often grown at the expense of the traditional national airlines.

There has also been a trend for these national airlines themselves to be privatized such as has occurred for [[Aer Lingus]] and [[British Airways]]. Other national airlines, including Italy's [[Alitalia]], have suffered – particularly with the rapid increase of oil prices in early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/alitalia-future-hinges-on-rescue-package/a-1320328|title=Alitalia Future Hinges on Rescue Package {{!}} Business {{!}} DW {{!}} 07.09.2004|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. airline industry===
{{main article|Air transportation in the United States}}

====Early development====
[[File:TWA 1940.jpg|thumb|[[TWA]] [[Douglas DC-3]] in 1940. The DC-3, often regarded as one of the most influential aircraft in the history of commercial aviation, revolutionized air travel.]]

[[Tony Jannus]] conducted the United States' first scheduled commercial airline flight on 1 January 1914 for the [[St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line]].&lt;ref name=Society&gt;{{cite web | title=Tony Jannus, an enduring legacy of aviation | work=Tony Jannus Distinguished Aviation Society | publisher=tonyjannusaward.com | url=http://www.tonyjannusaward.com/history/ | date= | accessdate=2010-12-02 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717073628/http://www.tonyjannusaward.com/history/ | archivedate=2011-07-17 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 23-minute flight traveled between [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] and [[Tampa, Florida]], passing some {{convert|50|ft|m}} above Tampa Bay in Jannus' [[Benoist XIV]] wood and muslin biplane flying boat. His passenger was a former mayor of St. Petersburg, who paid $400 for the privilege of sitting on a wooden bench in the open cockpit. The Airboat line operated for about four months, carrying more than 1,200 passengers who paid $5 each.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, Susan, First airline offered no frills, many thrills, [[Wall Street Journal]], December 31, 2013, p. B4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chalk's International Airlines]] began service between Miami and Bimini in the [[Bahamas]] in February 1919. Based in [[Ft. Lauderdale]], Chalk's claimed to be the oldest continuously operating airline in the United States until its closure in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airportbusiness.com/web/online/Top-News-Headlines/CHALKS-AIRLINES-LOSES-FLIGHT-LICENSE-ITS-AIRPORT-LEASE-COULD-BE-CANCELED/1$15115 |title=Chalks Airlines Loses Flight License | publisher=airportbusiness.com|date= |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[World War I]], the United States found itself swamped with aviators. Many decided to take their war-surplus aircraft on barnstorming campaigns, performing aerobatic maneuvers to woo crowds. In 1918, the [[United States Postal Service]] won the financial backing of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to begin experimenting with [[air mail]] service, initially using [[Curtiss Jenny]]&lt;ref&gt;Amick, George. "How The Airmail Got Off The Ground." American History 33.3 (1998): 48. Academic Search Premier. Web. 3 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; aircraft that had been procured by the [[United States Army Air Service]]. Private operators were the first to fly the mail but due to numerous accidents the US Army was tasked with mail delivery. During the Army's involvement they proved to be too unreliable and lost their air mail duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/airmail-service-it-began-with-army-air-service-pilots.htm|title=Airmail Service: It Began with Army Air Service Pilots {{!}} HistoryNet|website=www.historynet.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-1920s, the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] had developed its own air mail network, based on a transcontinental backbone between [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Anders (22 August 2014). "[https://disciplesofflight.com/big-arrow/ Now That's a Big Arrow]". Disciples of Flight. Retrieved 16 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; To supplement this service, they offered twelve contracts for spur routes to independent bidders. Some of the carriers that won these routes would, through time and mergers, evolve into [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Braniff Airways]], [[American Airlines]], [[United Airlines]] (originally a division of [[Boeing]]), [[Trans World Airlines]], [[Northwest Airlines]], and [[Eastern Air Lines]].

Service during the early 1920s was sporadic: most airlines at the time were focused on [[airmail#History|carrying bags of mail]]. In 1925, however, the [[Ford Motor Company]] bought out the [[William Bushnell Stout|Stout Aircraft Company]] and began construction of the all-metal [[Ford Trimotor]], which became the first successful American airliner. With a 12-passenger capacity, the Trimotor made passenger service potentially profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/current/airmail-in-america/the-airplanes/the-ford-trimotor.html | title = The Ford Trimotor and Douglas M-2 Mail Planes | work = Postal Museum | accessdate = July 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Air service was seen as a supplement to [[rail transport|rail]] service in the American transportation network.

At the same time, [[Juan Trippe]] began a crusade to create an air network that would link America to the world, and he achieved this goal through his airline, [[Pan American World Airways]], with a fleet of flying boats that linked [[Los Angeles]] to [[Shanghai]] and [[Boston]] to [[London]]. Pan Am and Northwest Airways (which began flights to Canada in the 1920s) were the only U.S. airlines to go international before the 1940s.

With the introduction of the [[Boeing 247]] and [[Douglas DC-3]] in the 1930s, the U.S. airline industry was generally profitable, even during the [[Great Depression]]. This trend continued until the beginning of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ASLAUrX3UE8C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=boeing+247+profitable#v=onepage&amp;q=boeing%20247%20profitable&amp;f=false|title=A Companion to International History 1900–2001|last=Martel|first=Gordon|date=2008-04-15|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470766293|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Development since 1945====
[[File:Boeing 377 Stratocruiser (B-29) American Overseas 1949-50.jpg|thumb|In October 1945, the [[American Export Airlines]] became the first airline to offer regular commercial flights between North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Commercial_Aviation/atlantic_route/Tran4.htm |title=Air Transportation: The Beginnings of Commercial Transatlantic Service |publisher=centennialofflight.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shown here is Am Ex [[Boeing 377]] ''Stratocruiser'' in 1949.]]

World War II, like World War I, brought new life to the airline industry. Many airlines in the Allied countries were flush from lease contracts to the military, and foresaw a future explosive demand for civil air transport, for both passengers and cargo. They were eager to invest in the newly emerging flagships of air travel such as the [[Boeing Stratocruiser]], [[Lockheed Constellation]], and [[Douglas DC-6]]. Most of these new aircraft were based on American bombers such as the [[B-29]], which had spearheaded research into new technologies such as [[pressurization]]. Most offered increased efficiency from both added speed and greater payload.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/airliners/2nd%20upload/timeline%2050s1.htm|title=history of airliners 1950 to 1959|website=www.century-of-flight.net|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jal.com/en/history/aircraft/60s/pick_61-70_01.html|title=History of JAL {{!}} DC-8-32|website=www.jal.com|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the [[De Havilland Comet]], [[Boeing 707]], [[Douglas DC-8]], and [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] became the first flagships of the Jet Age in the West, while the Eastern bloc had [[Tupolev Tu-104]] and [[Tupolev Tu-124]] in the fleets of state-owned carriers such as Czechoslovak [[Czech Airlines|ČSA]], Soviet [[Aeroflot]] and East-German [[Interflug]]. The [[Vickers Viscount]] and [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]] inaugurated turboprop transport.

On 4 October 1958, [[BOAC]] started [[transatlantic flight]]s between [[London Heathrow]] and [[New York-Idlewild Airport|New York Idlewild]] with a Comet 4, and [[Pan Am]] followed on 26 October with a B707 service between New York and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-how-the-jet-travel-era-began-in-earnest-449222/ |title= How the jet travel era began in earnest – 60 years ago |date= 4 Oct 2018 |author= Max Kingsley Jones |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next big boost for the airlines would come in the 1970s, when the [[Boeing 747]], [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], and [[Lockheed L-1011]] inaugurated [[widebody]] ("jumbo jet") service, which is still the standard in international travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-747-first-flight-47years-ago-2016-2|title=The Boeing 747 jumbo jet changed air travel with this momentous event 47 years ago|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tupolev Tu-144]] and its Western counterpart, [[Concorde]], made supersonic travel a reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-cold-war-race-to-build-the-concorde|title=The Cold War Race to Build the Concorde|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Concorde first flew in 1969 and operated through 2003. In 1972, [[Airbus]] began producing Europe's most commercially successful line of airliners to date. The added efficiencies for these aircraft were often not in speed, but in passenger capacity, payload, and range. Airbus also features modern electronic cockpits that were common across their aircraft to enable pilots to fly multiple models with minimal cross-training.

====US airline deregulation====

[[File:Pan Am Boeing 747 at Zurich Airport in May 1985.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pan Am]] [[Boeing 747]] ''Clipper Neptune's Car'' in 1985. The deregulation of the American airline industry increased the financial troubles of the airline which ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Commercial_Aviation/Bankruptcy/Tran9.htm |title=Air Transportation: The Airline Bankruptcies of the 1980s |publisher=centennialofflight.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The 1978 U.S. [[Airline deregulation act|airline industry deregulation]] lowered federally controlled barriers for new airlines just as a downturn in the nation's economy occurred. New start-ups entered during the downturn, during which time they found aircraft and funding, contracted hangar and maintenance services, trained new employees, and recruited laid off staff from other airlines.

Major airlines dominated their routes through aggressive pricing and additional capacity offerings, often swamping new start-ups. In the place of high barriers to entry imposed by regulation, the major airlines implemented an equally high barrier called [[loss leader]] pricing.&lt;ref name="Andrew R. Thomas"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/current-affairs/9781430236771 |title=Mr. Soft Landing: Airline Industry Strategy, Service, and Safety|publisher=Apress |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this strategy an already established and dominant airline stomps out its competition by lowering airfares on specific routes, below the cost of operating on it, choking out any chance a start-up airline may have. The industry side effect is an overall drop in revenue and service quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asq.org/quality-report/10-year-analysis.html |website =American Society of Quality (ASQ)|title = The American Society for Quality Debuts Quarterly Quality Report with 10-Year Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since deregulation in 1978 the average domestic ticket price has dropped by 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/airlines/analysis/analysis_airline_industry.html |publisher =Massachusetts Institute of Technology|title = Airline Industry Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; So has airline employee pay. By incurring massive losses, the airlines of the USA now rely upon a scourge of cyclical Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings to continue doing business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2011/12/blame_jimmy_carter_for_all_the_airline_bankruptcies_or_better_yet_thank_him_.html |title=Air Fail|publisher = Slate |work = Moneybox|date = 1 December 2011|last = Yglesias|first = Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[America West Airlines]] (which has since merged with US Airways) remained a significant survivor from this new entrant era, as dozens, even hundreds, have gone under.

In many ways, the biggest winner in the deregulated environment was the air passenger. Although not exclusively attributable to deregulation, indeed the U.S. witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel. Many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers, even joining [[frequent flyer]] loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying. New services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city, do business, and return the same day, from almost any point in the country. Air travel's advantages put long distance intercity [[railroad]] travel and bus lines under pressure, with most of the latter having withered away, whilst the former is still protected under [[nationalization]] through the continuing existence of [[Amtrak]].

By the 1980s, almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the U.S., and today the domestic industry operates over 10,000 daily departures nationwide.

Toward the end of the century, a new style of [[low-cost carrier|low cost airline]] emerged, offering a no-frills product at a lower price. [[Southwest Airlines]], [[JetBlue]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Skybus Airlines]] and other low-cost carriers began to represent a serious challenge to the so-called "legacy airlines", as did their low-cost counterparts in many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/budget-airline-trends-2016/index.html|title=Budget airlines changed the world. What next?|date=2016-03-21|work=CNN Travel|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their commercial viability represented a serious competitive threat to the legacy carriers. However, of these, [[ATA Airlines|ATA]] and Skybus have since ceased operations.

Increasingly since 1978, US airlines have been reincorporated and [[off spin|spun off]] by newly created and internally led management companies, and thus becoming nothing more than operating units and subsidiaries with limited financially decisive control. Among some of these [[holding company|holding companies]] and [[parent company|parent companies]] which are relatively well known, are the [[UAL Corporation]], along with the [[AMR Corporation]], among a long [[list of airline holding companies]] sometime recognized worldwide. Less recognized are the [[private equity firm]]s which often seize managerial, financial, and [[board of directors]] control of distressed airline companies by temporarily investing large sums of [[Equity (finance)|capital]] in air carriers, to rescheme an airlines assets into a profitable organization or [[liquidate|liquidating]] an air carrier of their profitable and worthwhile routes and business operations.

Thus the last 50 years of the airline industry have varied from reasonably profitable, to devastatingly depressed. As the first major market to deregulate the industry in 1978, U.S. airlines have experienced more turbulence than almost any other country or region. In fact, no U.S. [[legacy carrier]] survived bankruptcy-free. Among the outspoken critics of deregulation, former CEO of American Airlines, [[Robert Crandall]] has publicly stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing shows airline industry deregulation was a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/45477274/AMR_Filing_Shows_Airline_Deregulation_Failed_Ex_CEO |title=Robert Cranall former CEO AA, CNBC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429202738/http://www.cnbc.com/id/45477274/AMR_Filing_Shows_Airline_Deregulation_Failed_Ex_CEO |archivedate=2013-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====The airline industry bailout====

Congress passed the [https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/2926 Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act] (P.L. 107-42) in response to a severe liquidity crisis facing the already-troubled airline industry in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11th terrorist attacks]]. Through the [[Air Transportation Stabilization Board|ATSB]] Congress sought to provide cash infusions to carriers for both the cost of the four-day federal shutdown of the airlines and the incremental losses incurred through December 31, 2001, as a result of the terrorist attacks. This resulted in the first government bailout of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ostpxweb.ost.dot.gov/aviation/Data/stabilizationact.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409061950/http://ostpxweb.ost.dot.gov/aviation/Data/stabilizationact.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000 and 2005 US airlines lost $30 billion with wage cuts of over $15 billion and 100,000 employees laid off.&lt;ref name="Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. 2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100965480|authors=Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. |year=2009 |title=Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees|publisher=Cornell University Press, Ithaca |chapter=chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of the essential national economic role of a healthy aviation system, Congress authorized partial compensation of up to $5 billion in cash subject to review by the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] and up to $10 billion in loan guarantees subject to review by a newly created [[Air Transportation Stabilization Board]] (ATSB). The applications to DOT for reimbursements were subjected to rigorous multi-year reviews not only by DOT program personnel but also by the [[Government Accountability Office]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04725r.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the DOT Inspector General.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=/data/pdfdocs/aa20011024.pdf ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717225216/http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=%2Fdata%2Fpdfdocs%2Faa20011024.pdf |date=July 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=/data/pdfdocs/cr2003092.pdf ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717231319/http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=%2Fdata%2Fpdfdocs%2Fcr2003092.pdf |date=July 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the federal government provided $4.6 billion in one-time, subject-to-income-tax cash payments to 427 U.S. air carriers, with no provision for repayment, essentially a gift from the taxpayers. (Passenger carriers operating scheduled service received approximately $4 billion, subject to tax.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.gov/affairs/carrierpayments.htm |title=U |publisher=Dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527104415/http://www.dot.gov/affairs/carrierpayments.htm |archivedate=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ATSB approved loan guarantees to six airlines totaling approximately $1.6 billion. Data from the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] show that the government recouped the $1.6 billion and a profit of $339 million from the fees, interest and purchase of discounted airline stock associated with loan guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/atsb/ |title=Air Transportation Stabilization Board |publisher=Treas.gov |date=2001-09-22 |accessdate=2010-08-22|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080709052637/http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/atsb/ |archivedate = July 9, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three largest [[major carrier]]s and [[Southwest Airlines]] control 70% of the U.S. passenger market.&lt;ref name=AvWeek14May2018/&gt;

===Asian airline industry===

Although [[Philippine Airlines]] (PAL) was officially founded on February 26, 1941, its license to operate as an airliner was derived from merged Philippine Aerial Taxi Company (PATCO) established by mining magnate Emmanuel N. Bachrach on December 3, 1930, making it Asia's oldest scheduled carrier still in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/hawaiiaviation/hawaii-commercial-aviation/philippine-air-lines |title=Above the Pacific |first=William Joseph |last=Horvat |date=1966 |isbn=978-0-8168-0000-1 |publisher=Hawaii.gov |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial air service commenced three weeks later from [[Manila]] to [[Baguio]], making it Asia's first airline route. Bachrach's death in 1937 paved the way for its eventual merger with Philippine Airlines in March 1941 and made it Asia's oldest airline. It is also the oldest airline in Asia still operating under its current name.&lt;ref name="PAL"&gt;Jane, ''[http://www.janes.com Jane's airlines &amp; airliners By Jeremy Flack]'', First Edition, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-00-715174-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachrach's majority share in PATCO was bought by beer magnate Andres R. Soriano in 1939 upon the advice of General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and later merged with newly formed Philippine Airlines with PAL as the surviving entity. Soriano has controlling interest in both airlines before the merger. PAL restarted service on March 15, 1941, with a single [[Beech Model 18]] NPC-54 aircraft, which started its daily services between [[Manila]] (from [[Nielson Field]]) and [[Baguio]], later to expand with larger aircraft such as the DC-3 and Vickers Viscount.

[[Korean Air]] was one of the first airlines to be launched among the other Asian countries in 1946 along with [[Asiana Airlines]], which later joined in 1988. The license to operate as an airliner was granted by the federal government body after reviewing the necessity at the national assembly. The [[Hanjin]] occupies the largest ownership of Korean Air as well as few low-budget airlines as of now. The Korean Air is among the founders of [[Sky Team]], which was established in 2000. Asiana Airlines joined [[Star Alliance]] in 2003. Korean Air and Asiana Airlines comprise one of the largest combined airline miles and number of passenger served at the regional market of Asian airline industry

[[India]] was also one of the first countries to embrace civil aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pran Nath Seth|author2=Pran Nath Seth, Sushma Seth Bhat|title=An Introduction To Travel And Tourism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AcGn-Fmc43sC&amp;pg=PA111|year=2003|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd|isbn=978-81-207-2482-2|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first Asian airline companies was [[Air India]], which was founded as [[Tata Airlines]] in 1932, a division of Tata Sons Ltd. (now [[Tata Group]]). The airline was founded by India's leading industrialist, [[JRD Tata]]. On October 15, 1932, J. R. D. Tata himself flew a single engined [[De Havilland Puss Moth]] carrying air mail (postal mail of [[Imperial Airways]]) from [[Karachi]] to [[Mumbai|Bombay]] via [[Ahmedabad]]. The aircraft continued to [[Madras]] via Bellary piloted by [[Royal Air Force]] pilot [[Nevill Vintcent]]. Tata Airlines was also one of the world's first major airlines which began its operations without any support from the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S Bhatt|title=International Environmental Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0g7tCYYu-gC&amp;pg=PA175|year=2007|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=978-81-313-0125-8|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of World War II, the airline presence in Asia came to a relative halt, with many new flag carriers donating their aircraft for military aid and other uses. Following the end of the war in 1945, regular commercial service was restored in India and Tata Airlines became a public limited company on July 29, 1946, under the name Air India. After the [[independence of India]], 49% of the airline was acquired by the [[Government of India]]. In return, the airline was granted status to operate international services from India as the designated flag carrier under the name [[Air India International]].

On July 31, 1946, a chartered Philippine Airlines (PAL) [[DC-4]] ferried 40 American servicemen to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]], from Nielson Airport in [[Makati City]] with stops in [[Guam]], [[Wake Island]], [[Johnston Atoll]] and [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], making PAL the first Asian airline to cross the [[Pacific Ocean]]. A regular service between [[Manila]] and [[San Francisco]] was started in December. It was during this year that the airline was designated as the flag carrier of Philippines.

During the era of [[decolonization]], newly born Asian countries started to embrace air transport. Among the first Asian carriers during the era were [[Cathay Pacific]] of [[Hong Kong]] (founded in September 1946), [[Orient Airways]] (later [[Pakistan International Airlines]]; founded in October 1946), [[Air Ceylon]] (later [[SriLankan Airlines]]; founded in 1947), [[Malayan Airways Limited]] in 1947 (later [[Singapore Airlines|Singapore]] and [[Malaysia Airlines]]), [[El Al]] in [[Israel]] in 1948, [[Garuda Indonesia]] in 1949, [[Japan Airlines]] in 1951, [[Thai Airways International]] in 1960, and [[Korean National Airlines]] in 1947.

Among the first countries to have regular airlines in Latin America and the Caribbean were [[Bolivia]] with [[Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bolivia/Transportation#ref312761|title=Bolivia - Transportation {{!}} history - geography|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cuba]] with [[Cubana de Aviación]], [[Colombia]] with [[Avianca]] (the first airline established in the Americas), Argentina with [[Aerolineas Argentinas]], [[Chile]] with [[LAN Chile]] (today [[LATAM Airlines]]), [[Brazil]] with [[Varig]], [[Dominican Republic]] with [[Dominicana de Aviación]], [[Mexico]] with [[Mexicana de Aviación]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] with [[BWIA West Indies Airways]] (today [[Caribbean Airlines]]), [[Venezuela]] with [[Aeropostal]], [[Puerto Rico]] with [[Aerovias nacionales de puerto rico|Puertorriquena]]; and [[Grupo TACA|TACA]] based in [[El Salvador]] and representing several airlines of [[Central America]] ([[Costa Rica]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]]). All the previous airlines started regular operations well before [[World War II]]. Puerto Rican commercial airlines such as [[Prinair]], [[Oceanair]], [[Fina Air]] and [[Vieques Air Link]] came much after the second world war, as did several others from other countries like Mexico's [[Interjet]] and [[Volaris]], Venezuela's [[Aserca Airlines]] and others.

The air travel market has evolved rapidly over recent years in [[Latin America]]. Some industry estimates indicate that over 2,000 new aircraft will begin service over the next five years in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latin America needs more than 2,000 new passenger aircraft in next 20 years|url=http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/latin-america-needs-more-than-2000-new-passenger-aircraft-in-next-20-years/|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These airlines serve domestic flights within their countries, as well as connections within Latin America and also overseas flights to North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.

Only two airlines - [[Avianca]] and [[LATAM Airlines]] - have international subsidiaries and cover many destinations within the Americas as well as major hubs in other continents. LATAM with [[Chile]] as the central operation along with [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]] and formerly with some operations in the [[Dominican Republic]]. The [[AviancaTaca Holding|AviancaTACA]] group has control of [[Avianca Brazil]], [[VIP Ecuador]] and a strategic alliance with [[AeroGal]].

==Regulatory considerations==

===National===
[[File:Garuda Indonesia Boeing 737-800 PER Koch-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Garuda Indonesia]] [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]] parked at [[Perth International Airport]]. This Indonesian [[flag carrier]] is owned by the [[Politics of Indonesia|Indonesian Government]]]]

Many countries have [[Flag carrier|national airline]]s that the government owns and operates. Fully private airlines are subject to a great deal of government regulation for economic, political, and safety concerns. For instance, governments often intervene to halt airline labor actions to protect the free flow of people, communications, and goods between different regions without compromising safety.

The United States, Australia, and to a lesser extent Brazil, Mexico, India, the United Kingdom, and Japan have "deregulated" their airlines. In the past, these governments dictated airfares, route networks, and other operational requirements for each airline. Since deregulation, airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own operating arrangements with different airports, enter and exit routes easily, and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand.
[[File:Cyprus airways a330.jpg|thumb|[[Cyprus Airways]], the now defunct national airline of Cyprus]]
The entry barriers for new airlines are lower in a deregulated market, and so the U.S. has seen hundreds of airlines start up (sometimes for only a brief operating period). This has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets. The added competition, together with pricing freedom, means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that, to a limited degree, full service airlines must match. This is a major constraint on profitability for established carriers, which tend to have a higher cost base.

As a result, profitability in a deregulated market is uneven for most airlines. These forces have caused some major airlines to go out of business, in addition to most of the poorly established new entrants.

In the United States, the airline industry is dominated by four large firms. Because of industry consolidation, after fuel prices dropped considerably in 2015, very little of the savings were passed on to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;"Too Much of a Good Thing." ''The Economist'' 26 March 2016: 23. print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
[[File:SIA Airbus A380, 9V-SKA, SIN 8.jpg|thumb|[[Singapore Airlines]] [[Airbus A380]] landing at [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]]. Singapore Airlines is the first international airline to operate the A380, the world's largest passenger airliner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singaporeair.com/mediacentre/pacontent/news/NE_1608.jsp Singapore Airlines - News Releases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620235612/http://www.singaporeair.com/mediacentre/pacontent/news/NE_1608.jsp |date=2008-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Groups such as the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] establish worldwide standards for safety and other vital concerns. Most international air traffic is regulated by bilateral agreements between countries, which designate specific carriers to operate on specific routes. The model of such an agreement was the [[Bermuda Agreement]] between the US and UK following World War II, which designated airports to be used for transatlantic flights and gave each government the authority to nominate carriers to operate routes.

Bilateral agreements are based on the "[[freedoms of the air]]", a group of generalized traffic rights ranging from the freedom to overfly a country to the freedom to provide domestic flights within a country (a very rarely granted right known as [[cabotage]]). Most agreements permit airlines to fly from their home country to designated airports in the other country: some also extend the freedom to provide continuing service to a third country, or to another destination in the other country while carrying passengers from overseas.

In the 1990s, "[[open skies]]" agreements became more common. These agreements take many of these regulatory powers from state governments and open up international routes to further competition. Open skies agreements have met some criticism, particularly within the European Union, whose airlines would be at a comparative disadvantage with the United States' because of [[cabotage]] restrictions.

==Economic considerations==

In 2017, 4.1 billion passengers have been carried by airlines in 41.9 million commercial scheduled flights (an average payload of {{#expr:4100/41.9round0}} passengers), for 7.75 trillion [[passenger kilometre]]s (an average trip of {{#expr:7750/4.100round0}} km) over 45,091 airline routes served globally.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=ATAGOct2018&gt;--&gt;
In 2016, air transport generated $704.4 billion of revenue in 2016, employed 10.2 million workers, supported 65.5 million jobs and $2.7 trillion of economic activity: 3.6% of the global [[GDP]].&lt;ref name=ATAGOct2018&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.aviationbenefits.org/media/166344/abbb18_full-report_web.pdf |publisher= Air Transport Action Group |title= Aviation: Benefits Beyond Borders |date= October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, the total weekly airline capacity was 181.1 billion [[Available Seat Kilometers]] (+6.9% compared to July 2015): 57.6bn in Asia-Pacific, 47.7bn in Europe, 46.2bn in North America, 12.2bn in Middle East, 12.0bn in Latin America and 5.4bn in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://html5.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/desktop/stage/default.aspx?pnum=78&amp;edid=e030c749-44c6-4ab0-af51-84e8f4424689 |title= Capacity snapshot |work= Airline Business |date= July–August 2016 |publisher= Flight Global |page= 78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
[[File:Tran12G7.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juan Trippe]], the founder of [[Pan American World Airways]], surveying his globe]]

Historically, air travel has survived largely through state support, whether in the form of equity or subsidies. The airline industry as a whole has made a cumulative loss during its 100-year history, once the costs include subsidies for aircraft development and airport construction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/airlines/story/0,,1715861,00.html Wings of Desire], Guardian, Thursday February 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnkay.com/2005/09/27/airlines-and-the-canine-features-of-unprofitable-industries/ Airlines and the canine features of unprofitable industries], Financial Times, September 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

One argument is that [[positive externalities]], such as higher growth due to global mobility, outweigh the microeconomic losses and justify continuing government intervention. A historically high level of government intervention in the airline industry can be seen as part of a wider political consensus on strategic forms of transport, such as [[highway]]s and [[Rail transport|railways]], both of which receive public funding in most parts of the world. Although many countries continue to operate state-owned or parastatal airlines, many large airlines today are privately owned and are therefore governed by microeconomic principles to maximize shareholder profit.

In December 1991, the collapse of Pan Am, an airline often credited for shaping the international airline industry, highlighted the financial complexities faced by major airline companies.

Following the [[Airline Deregulation Act|1978 deregulation]], U.S. carriers did not manage to make an aggregate [[economic profit|profit]] for 12 years in 31, including four years where combined [[economic loss|losses]] amounted to $10 billion, but rebounded with eight consecutive years of profits since 2010, including its four with over $10 billion profits.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek14May2018/&gt;--&gt;

=== Largest airlines ===
The [[world's largest airlines]] can be defined in several ways. [[American Airlines Group]] is the largest by its fleet size, [[revenue]], [[profit (accounting)|profit]], [[passenger]]s carried and [[revenue passenger mile]]. [[Delta Air Lines]] is the largest by [[asset]]s value and [[market capitalization]]. [[Lufthansa Group]] is the largest by number of [[employee]]s, [[FedEx Express]] by freight [[tonne-kilometer]]s, [[Ryanair]] by number of international passengers carried and [[Turkish Airlines]] by number of countries served.

===Ticket revenue===

Airlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability. The pricing of airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely determined by computerized [[yield management]] systems.

Because of the complications in scheduling flights and maintaining profitability, airlines have many loopholes that can be used by the knowledgeable traveler. Many of these airfare secrets are becoming more and more known to the general public, so airlines are forced to make constant adjustments.

Most airlines use differentiated pricing, a form of [[price discrimination]], to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments. Factors influencing the price include the days remaining until departure, the booked load factor, the forecast of total demand by price point, competitive pricing in force, and variations by day of week of departure and by time of day. Carriers often accomplish this by dividing each cabin of the aircraft (first, business and economy) into a number of [[travel class]]es for pricing purposes.

A complicating factor is that of origin-destination control ("O&amp;D control"). Someone purchasing a ticket from Melbourne to Sydney (as an example) for A$200 is competing with someone else who wants to fly Melbourne to Los Angeles through Sydney on the same flight, and who is willing to pay A$1400. Should the airline prefer the $1400 passenger, or the $200 passenger plus a possible Sydney-Los Angeles passenger willing to pay $1300? Airlines have to make hundreds of thousands of similar pricing decisions daily.
[[File:Flughafen Frankfurt am Main.JPG|thumb|[[Lufthansa]] [[Boeing 747-400]]. Lufthansa is the [[flag carrier]] airline of [[Germany]].]]

The advent of advanced computerized reservations systems in the late 1970s, most notably [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], allowed airlines to easily perform [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefit analyses]] on different pricing structures, leading to almost perfect price discrimination in some cases (that is, filling each seat on an aircraft at the highest price that can be charged without driving the consumer elsewhere).

The intense nature of airfare pricing has led to the term "[[fare war]]" to describe efforts by airlines to undercut other airlines on competitive routes. Through computers, new airfares can be published quickly and efficiently to the airlines' sales channels. For this purpose the airlines use the [[Airline Tariff Publishing Company]] (ATPCO), who distribute latest fares for more than 500 airlines to [[Computer Reservation System]]s across the world.

The extent of these pricing phenomena is strongest in "legacy" carriers. In contrast, low fare carriers usually offer pre-announced and simplified price structure, and sometimes quote prices for each leg of a trip separately.

Computers also allow airlines to predict, with some accuracy, how many passengers will actually fly after making a reservation to fly. This allows airlines to overbook their flights enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for "no-shows", but not enough (in most cases) to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats, stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with [[overbooking]] on high demand flights can help reduce this figure. This is especially crucial during tough economic times as airlines undertake massive cuts to ticket prices to retain demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cheapflights.co.uk/flights/2009/05/recession-prompts-surge-in-cheap-flights.html |title=Recession 'prompts surge in cheap flights' |publisher=News.cheapflights.co.uk |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2010-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130120521/http://news.cheapflights.co.uk/flights/2009/05/recession-prompts-surge-in-cheap-flights.html |archive-date=2009-11-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over January/February 2018, the cheapest airline surveyed by price comparator [[rome2rio]] was [[Tigerair Australia]] with $0.06/km followed by [[AirAsia X]] with $0.07/km, while the most expensive was [[Charterlines, Inc.]] with $1.26/km followed by [[Buddha Air]] with $1.18/km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.rome2rio.com/labs/2018-global-flight-price-ranking/ |title= 2018 Global Flight Price Ranking: What’s the world’s cheapest airline? |publisher= [[rome2rio]] |date= April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[IATA]], the global airline industry [[revenue]] was $754 billion in 2017 for a $38.4 billion collective [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], and should rise by 10.7% to $834 billion in 2018 for a $33.8 billion profit forecast, down by 12% due to rising [[jet fuel]] and [[Workforce|labor]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/airlines-formula-protecting-profits-higher-fares |title= Airlines’ Formula For Protecting Profits: Higher Fares |date= Jun 12, 2018 |author= Jens Flottau, Adrian Schofield and Aaron Karp |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Elasticity ====

The demand for air transport will be less [[Elasticity (economics)|elastic]] for [[flight length|longer flights]] than for shorter flights, and more elastic for leisure travel than for [[business travel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.fin.gc.ca/consultresp/Airtravel/airtravStdy_-eng.asp |title= Air Travel Demand Elasticities: Concepts, Issues and Measurement |author= David W. Gillen, William G. Morrison, Christopher Stewart |date= 2008-10-06 |publisher= [[Department of Finance Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operating costs===
[[File:virgin atlantic a340-600 g-vyou arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Airbus A340]]-600 of [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]]. In October 2008, Virgin Atlantic offered to combine its operations with [[BMI (airline)|BMI]] in an effort to reduce operating costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article5037731.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Virgin proposes tieup with BMI and Lufthansa | date=October 29, 2008 | accessdate=April 23, 2010 | first=David | last=Robertson}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Full-service airlines have a high level of fixed and operating costs to establish and maintain air services: labor, fuel, airplanes, engines, spares and parts, IT services and networks, airport equipment, airport handling services, sales distribution, catering, training, [[aviation insurance]] and other costs. Thus all but a small percentage of the income from ticket sales is paid out to a wide variety of external providers or internal cost centers.

Moreover, the industry is structured so that airlines often act as tax collectors. Airline fuel is untaxed because of a series of treaties existing between countries. Ticket prices include a number of fees, taxes and surcharges beyond the control of airlines. Airlines are also responsible for enforcing government regulations. If airlines carry passengers without proper documentation on an international flight, they are responsible for returning them back to the original country.

Analysis of the 1992–1996 period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than the airlines, who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales. While airlines as a whole earned 6% return on capital employed (2–3.5% less than the cost of capital), airports earned 10%, catering companies 10–13%, handling companies 11–14%, aircraft lessors 15%, aircraft manufacturers 16%, and global distribution companies more than 30%. (Source: Spinetta, 2000, quoted in Doganis, 2002)

The widespread entrance of a new breed of [[low cost airline]]s beginning at the turn of the century has accelerated the demand that full service carriers control costs. Many of these low-cost companies emulate [[Southwest Airlines]] in various respects, and like Southwest, they can eke out a consistent profit throughout all phases of the business cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2015/10/08/the-southwest-effect-is-alive-and-well-airline-executives-say|title=The Southwest effect is|date=2015-10-08|work=Dallas News|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, a [[shakeout]] of airlines is occurring in the U.S. and elsewhere. [[American Airlines]], [[United Airlines]], [[Continental Airlines]] (twice), [[US Airways]] (twice), [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[Northwest Airlines]] have all declared [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy.

Where an airline has established an engineering base at an airport, then there may be considerable economic advantages in using that same airport as a preferred focus (or "hub") for its scheduled flights.

Operating costs for US [[major airline]]s are primarily aircraft [[operating expense]] including [[jet fuel]], [[aircraft maintenance]], [[depreciation]] and [[aircrew]] for 44%, servicing expense for 29% (traffic 11%, passenger 11% and aircraft 7%), 14% for reservations and sales and 13% for [[overheads]] (administration 6% and advertising 2%).&lt;!--&lt;ref name=ICAO20feb2017/&gt;--&gt;
An average US major [[Boeing 757]]-200 flies {{cvt|1252|mile|km}} stages 11.3 block hours per day and costs $2,550 per block hour : $923 of ownership, $590 of maintenance, $548 of fuel and $489 of crew; or $13.34 per 186 seats per block hour.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=ICAO20feb2017/&gt;--&gt;
For a [[Boeing 737-500]], a low-cost carrier like Southwest have lower operating costs at $1,526 than a full service one like United at $2,974, and higher [[productivity]] with 399,746 [[available seat miles|ASM]] per day against 264,284, resulting in a unit cost of {{#expr:152600/399746round2}} $cts/ASM against {{#expr:297400/264284round2}} $cts/ASM.&lt;ref name=ICAO20feb2017&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.icao.int/MID/Documents/2017/Aviation%20Data%20and%20Analysis%20Seminar/PPT3%20-%20Airlines%20Operating%20costs%20and%20productivity.pdf |title= Airline Operating Costs and Productivity |date= 20 February 2017 |publisher= ICAO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assets and financing===
[[File:Maslounge.jpg|thumb|The 'Golden Lounge' of [[Malaysia Airlines]] at [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] (KLIA). The airline has ownership of special slots at KLIA, giving it a competitive edge over other airlines operating at the airport.]]
Airline financing is quite complex, since airlines are highly leveraged operations. Not only must they purchase (or lease) new airliner bodies and engines regularly, they must make major long-term fleet decisions with the goal of meeting the demands of their markets while producing a fleet that is relatively economical to operate and maintain; comparably Southwest Airlines and their reliance on a single airplane type (the [[Boeing 737]] and derivatives), with the now defunct [[Eastern Air Lines]] which operated 17 different aircraft types, each with varying pilot, engine, maintenance, and support needs.

A second financial issue is that of [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[fuel]] purchases, which are usually second only to [[Labour (economics)|labor]] in its relative cost to the company. However, with the current high fuel prices it has become the largest cost to an airline. Legacy airlines, compared with new entrants, have been hit harder by rising fuel prices partly due to the running of older, less fuel efficient aircraft.&lt;ref name="Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. 2009"/&gt; While hedging instruments can be expensive, they can easily pay for themselves many times over in periods of increasing fuel costs, such as in the 2000–2005 period.

In view of the congestion apparent at many international [[airport]]s, the ownership of slots at certain airports (the right to take-off or land an aircraft at a particular time of day or night) has become a significant tradable asset for many airlines. Clearly take-off slots at popular times of the day can be critical in attracting the more profitable business traveler to a given airline's flight and in establishing a competitive advantage against a competing airline.

If a particular city has two or more airports, market forces will tend to attract the less profitable routes, or those on which competition is weakest, to the less congested airport, where slots are likely to be more available and therefore cheaper. For example, [[Reagan National Airport]] attracts profitable routes due partly to its congestion, leaving less-profitable routes to [[Baltimore-Washington International Airport]] and [[Dulles International Airport]].

Other factors, such as surface transport facilities and onward connections, will also affect the relative appeal of different airports and some long distance flights may need to operate from the one with the longest runway. For example, [[LaGuardia Airport]] is the preferred airport for most of [[Manhattan]] due to its proximity, while long-distance routes must use [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]'s longer runways.

===Airline partnerships===
[[File:largest airline alliances.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Home countries of airlines in the largest airline alliances: Star Alliance (grey), SkyTeam (blue) and Oneworld (purple). IATA codes of founders are outlined in red.]]
[[File:JA8941-oneworld-01.jpg|thumb|A [[Japan Airlines]] Boeing 777-300 with special [[Oneworld]] livery. Oneworld is the third largest airline alliance after [[Star Alliance]] and [[SkyTeam]].]]

[[Codeshare agreement|Codesharing]] is the most common type of airline partnership; it involves one airline selling tickets for another airline's flights under its own airline code. An early example of this was Japan Airlines' (JAL) codesharing partnership with Aeroflot in the 1960s on [[Tokyo]]–[[Moscow]] flights; Aeroflot operated the flights using Aeroflot aircraft, but JAL sold tickets for the flights as if they were JAL flights. This practice allows airlines to expand their operations, at least on paper, into parts of the world where they cannot afford to establish bases or purchase aircraft. Another example was the [[Austrian Airlines|Austrian]]–[[Sabena]] partnership on the [[Vienna]]–[[Brussels]]–[[New York City|New York]]/JFK route during the late '60s, using a Sabena [[Boeing 707]] with Austrian [[Aircraft livery|livery]].

Since airline reservation requests are often made by city-pair (such as "show me flights from Chicago to Düsseldorf"), an airline that can codeshare with another airline for a variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering a Chicago–[[Düsseldorf]] flight. The passenger is advised however, that airline no. 1 operates the flight from say Chicago to Amsterdam, and airline no. 2 operates the continuing flight (on a different airplane, sometimes from another terminal) to Düsseldorf. Thus the primary rationale for code sharing is to expand one's service offerings in city-pair terms to increase sales.

A more recent development is the [[airline alliance]], which became prevalent in the late 1990s. These alliances can act as virtual mergers to get around government restrictions. Alliances of airlines such as [[Star Alliance]], [[Oneworld]], and [[SkyTeam]] coordinate their passenger service programs (such as [[Airport lounge|lounges]] and [[frequent-flyer program]]s), offer special [[Interlining|interline]] tickets, and often engage in extensive [[Codeshare agreement|codesharing]] (sometimes systemwide). These are increasingly integrated business combinations—sometimes including cross-equity arrangements—in which products, service standards, schedules, and airport facilities are standardized and combined for higher efficiency. One of the first airlines to start an alliance with another airline was [[KLM]], who partnered with [[Northwest Airlines]]. Both airlines later entered the SkyTeam alliance after the [[Air France-KLM|fusion of KLM and Air France]] in 2004.

Often the companies combine [[Information technology|IT]] operations, or purchase fuel and aircraft as a bloc to achieve higher bargaining power. However, the alliances have been most successful at purchasing invisible supplies and services, such as fuel. Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors. If an airline's main domestic competitor flies Boeing airliners, then the airline may prefer to use Airbus aircraft regardless of what the rest of the alliance chooses.

===Fuel hedging===
{{Main article|Fuel Hedging}}Fuel hedging is a [[contractual]] tool used by transportation companies like airlines to reduce their exposure to volatile and potentially rising fuel costs. Several low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines adopt this practice.&lt;ref name = economist&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2015/01/fuel-hedging-and-airlines|title=Gambles that haven't paid off|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date= | language =en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southwest is credited with maintaining strong business profits between 1999 and the early 2000s due to its fuel hedging policy. Many other airlines are replicating Southwest's hedging policy to control their fuel costs.&lt;ref name = economist/&gt;

=== Seasonality ===
Airlines often have a strong [[seasonality]], with traffic low in [[Winter]] and peaking in [[Summer]]. In Europe the most extreme market are the [[Greek islands]] with July/August having more than ten times the winter traffic, as [[Jet2]] is the most seasonal among [[low-cost carrier]]s with July having seven times the January traffic, whereas [[legacy carrier]]s are much less with only 85/115% variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.anna.aero/2017/03/01/greek-islands-jet2-com-seasonality-losers-europe/ |title= Seasonality: Jet2.com and Greek Islands most extreme in anna.aero leisure-legacy comparison |work= Airline Network News and Analysis |date= 1 Mar 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aircraft engines emit [[noise pollution]], gases and particulate emissions, and contribute to [[global dimming]].&lt;ref name=contrails&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contrails reduce daily temperature range |first=David J. |last=Travis |author2=Carleton, Andrew M. |author3=Lauritsen, Ryan G |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |page=601 |volume=418 |year=2002 |url=http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf |doi=10.1038/418601a |format=PDF |pmid=12167846 |issue=6898 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503192714/http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-03 |df= |bibcode=2002Natur.418..601T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth of the industry in recent years raised a number of ecological questions.

Domestic air transport grew in China at 15.5 percent annually from 2001 to 2006. The rate of air travel globally increased at 3.7 percent per year over the same time. In the EU [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from aviation increased by 87% between 1990 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Climate change: Commission proposes bringing air transport into EU Emissions Trading Scheme |publisher=EU press release |date=2006-12-20 |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/1862 |accessdate=2008-01-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112155545/http://www.europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP%2F06%2F1862 |archivedate=12 January 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; However it must be compared with the flights increase, only in UK, between 1990 and 2006 terminal passengers increased from 100 000 thousands to 250 000 thousands.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN03760.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; according to AEA reports every year, 750 million passengers travel by European airlines, which also share 40% of merchandise value in and out of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aea.be/about/airtransportineurope/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724203254/http://www.aea.be/about/airtransportineurope/index.html |archivedate=2013-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without even pressure from "green activists", targeting lower ticket prices, generally, airlines do what is possible to cut the fuel consumption (and gas emissions connected therewith). Further, according to some reports, it can be concluded that the last piston-powered aircraft were as fuel-efficient as the average jet in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transportenvironment.org/sites/default/files//docs/Publications/2005pubs/2005-12_nlr_aviation_fuel_efficiency.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite continuing efficiency improvements from the major aircraft manufacturers, the expanding demand for global air travel has resulted in growing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Currently, the aviation sector, including US domestic and global international travel, make approximately 1.6 percent of global anthropogenic GHG emissions per annum. North America accounts for nearly 40 percent of the world's GHG emissions from aviation fuel use.&lt;ref&gt;David McCollum, Gregory Gould, and David Greene. Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Aviation and Marine Transportation: Mitigation Potential and Policies, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

CO2 emissions from the [[jet fuel]] burned per passenger on an average {{convert|3200|km|mi|sp=us}} airline flight is about 353 kilograms (776&amp;nbsp;pounds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=carbon-footprint-calculator |url=http://www.terrapass.com/carbon-footprint-calculator/methodology-popup.html |publisher=TerraPass.com |accessdate=Feb 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131210919/http://www.terrapass.com/carbon-footprint-calculator/methodology-popup.html |archivedate=2009-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loss of natural habitat potential associated with the jet fuel burned per passenger on a {{convert|3200|km|mi|sp=us}} airline flight is estimated to be 250 square meters (2700 square feet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=environmental impact of airline flights|url=http://xoearth.org/ecofx-airline-flights/|publisher=ecofx.org|accessdate=Apr 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of climate change and [[peak oil]], there is a debate about possible [[taxation]] of air travel and the inclusion of aviation in an [[emissions trading]] scheme, with a view to ensuring that the total [[external costs]] of aviation are taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/trading/eu/pdf/including-aviation-icf.pdf Including Aviation into the EU ETS: Impact on EU allowance prices] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215004933/http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/trading/eu/pdf/including-aviation-icf.pdf |date=February 15, 2006 }} ICF Consulting for DEFRA February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The airline industry is responsible for about 11 percent of [[greenhouse gas]]es emitted by the U.S. transportation sector. [[Boeing]] estimates that [[biofuel]]s could reduce flight-related greenhouse-gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent. The solution would be blending algae fuels with existing jet fuel:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/03/AR2008010303907.html | work=The Washington Post | title=A Promising Oil Alternative: Algae Energy | date=January 6, 2008 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Boeing and [[Air New Zealand]] are collaborating with leading Brazilian biofuel maker [[Tecbio]], [[New Zealand]]'s [[Aquaflow Bionomic]] and other jet biofuel developers around the world.
* [[Virgin Atlantic]] and [[Virgin Green Fund]] are looking into the technology as part of a biofuel initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ángel González |url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/boeingaerospace/2003858756_boeingenergy30.html |title=To go green in jet fuel, Boeing looks at algae|work = Seattle Times Newspaper |date=2007-08-30 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[KLM]] has made the first commercial flight with biofuel in 2009.

There are projects on [[electric aircraft]], and some of them are fully operational as of 2013.

==Call signs==

Each operator of a scheduled or charter flight uses an [[Airline codes|airline call sign]] when communicating with airports or air traffic control centres. Most of these call-signs are derived from the airline's trade name, but for reasons of history, marketing, or the need to reduce ambiguity in spoken English (so that pilots do not mistakenly make navigational decisions based on instructions issued to a different aircraft), some airlines and air forces use call-signs less obviously connected with their trading name. For example, British Airways uses a ''Speedbird'' call-sign, named after the logo of its predecessor, [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]], while [[SkyEurope]] used ''Relax''.

==Airline personnel==
[[File:Air Bishkek A320-200 EX-32002 DME Dec 2012.png|thumb|[[Air Bishkek]] [[Airbus A320]] landing at [[Domodedovo Airport]] (2012)]]
The various types of airline personnel include:
Flight operations personnel including flight safety personnel.
* [[Flight crew]], responsible for the operation of the aircraft. Flight crew members include:
** [[Aviator|Pilots]] ([[Pilot in command|Captain]] and [[First officer (civil aviation)|First Officer]]: some older aircraft also required a [[Flight Engineer]] and/or a [[Navigator]])
** [[Flight attendant]]s (led by a [[purser]] on larger aircraft)
** [[Sky marshal|In-flight security personnel]] on some airlines (most notably [[El Al]])
* [[Groundcrew]], responsible for operations at airports. Ground crew members include:
** Aerospace and avionics engineers responsible for certifying the aircraft for flight and management of aircraft maintenance
*** [[Aerospace]] engineers, responsible for airframe, powerplant and electrical systems maintenance

** Crew schedulers
** 
Airlines follow a [[corporation|corporate]] structure where each broad area of operations (such as maintenance, flight operations (including flight safety), and passenger service) is supervised by a vice president. Larger airlines often appoint vice presidents to oversee each of the airline's hubs as well. Airlines employ [[lawyers]] to deal with regulatory procedures and other administrative tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hklaw.com/practices/aviation-regulation/|title=Aviation Regulation|website=www.hklaw.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry trends==
[[File:World-airline-routemap-2009.png|thumb|Map of scheduled airline traffic in 2009]]

The pattern of ownership has been privatized in the recent years, that is, the ownership has gradually changed from governments to private and individual sectors or organizations. This occurs as regulators permit greater freedom and non-government ownership, in steps that are usually decades apart. This pattern is not seen for all airlines in all regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Government-owned and Privatized Airlines (unofficial preliminary compilation) |publisher = [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] |url = https://www.icao.int/sustainability/Documents/PrivatizedAirlines.pdf|date = 4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth rates are not consistent in all regions, but countries with a de-regulated airline industry have more competition and greater pricing freedom. This results in lower fares and sometimes dramatic spurts in traffic growth. The U.S., Australia, Canada, [[Japan]], [[Brazil]], [[India]] and other markets exhibit this trend. The industry has been observed to be cyclical in its financial performance. Four or five years of poor earnings precede five or six years of improvement. But profitability even in the good years is generally low, in the range of 2–3% net profit after interest and tax. In times of profit, airlines lease new generations of airplanes and upgrade services in response to higher demand. Since 1980, the industry has not earned back the cost of capital during the best of times. Conversely, in bad times losses can be dramatically worse. [[Warren Buffett]] in 1999 said "the money that had been made since the dawn of aviation by all of this country's airline companies was zero. Absolutely zero."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiancapitalist.com/buffetts-spot-on-advice/ |title=Buffett’s spot-on advice |publisher=Money Sense |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in many mature industries, consolidation is a trend. Airline groupings may consist of limited bilateral partnerships, long-term, multi-faceted alliances between carriers, equity arrangements, [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]], or [[takeover]]s. Since governments often restrict ownership and merger between companies in different countries, most consolidation takes place within a country. In the U.S., over 200 airlines have merged, been taken over, or gone out of business since deregulation in 1978. Many international airline managers are lobbying their governments to permit greater consolidation to achieve higher economy and efficiency.

'''Australian securities law''' relates to [[security (finance)|securities]] issued by [[corporation]]s as well as other securities, including [[debenture]]s, [[stock]]s and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] issued by [[government]]s, and interests in [[managed investment scheme]]s.

Australian securities regulation rests on the principle that "financial markets cannot function effectively unless participants act with integrity and there is adequate disclosure to facilitate informed judgements".&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth of Australia ''Financial System Inquiry Final Report'' (1997) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many of the regulatory rules governing dealings in securities are part of a broader framework that governs [[financial product]]s, [[financial services]] and [[financial markets]].

Mandatory disclosure and conduct regulation underlie much of Australia's securities regulation. [[False trading]], [[fraudulent dealing]], and [[insider trading]] are dealt with to prevent improper practices in connection with securities markets. A licensing system operates to ensure securities markets are fair, orderly and transparent. At the same time, securities law is also facilitative, allocating rights and duties in conjunction with general [[contract law]]. It also allows for a degree of [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]], by the operation for example of an independent [[securities exchange]].

Australian securities law has been substantially modernised in recent years. The core of these laws are found in the ''[[Corporations Act 2001|Corporations Act]]'' 2001 (Cth), which contains provisions governing [[takeover]]s, [[fundraising]], and financial products, services and markets.

== Legal and regulatory framework ==

The main body of [[substantive law]] about securities is found in the ''[[Corporations Act 2001|Corporations Act]]'' 2001 (Cth), as well as the regulations made under that Act. Whilst much of the law is derived from earlier regulation (especially the [[Boom and bust|bust]] in Australian mineral stocks of the late 1960s), the sections relating to securities regulation have been subject to recent amendment. The takeovers provisions were substantially re-written by the ''Corporation Law Economic Reform Program Act'' 1999. Changes to financial products, financial markets, and financial services were introduced by the ''Financial Services Reform Act'' 2001 (Cth), as a result of the ''Final Report of the Financial System Inquiry'', commonly referred to as "the Wallis report."&lt;ref name=Wallis1997&gt;{{cite book|last1=Financial System Inquiry|title=Final Report of the Financial System Inquiry|date=1997|location=Canberra, Australia|url=http://fsi.treasury.gov.au/content/FinalReport.asp|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of securities law are also found in the general law governing [[contract law|contracts]], [[trust law|trusts]], and [[torts]]. Securities regulation under the ''Corporations Act'' operates against the background of other Commonwealth legislation on [[Australian criminal law|criminal law]], [[Australian administrative law|administrative law]],&lt;ref&gt;''Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act'' 1977; ''Freedom of Information Act'' 1982; ''Privacy Act'' 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[statutory interpretation]].&lt;ref&gt;''Commonwealth Acts Interpretation Act'' 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;

Administration of the legislation is the responsibility of the [[Treasurer of Australia|Commonwealth Treasurer]] and the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] (ASIC), according to the ''[[Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act]]'' 2001 (Cth) and the ''Corporations Act'' 2001 (Cth). The market operator [[Australian Stock Exchange]] also has an important regulatory role to play.

The resolution of disputes is confided to the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] and the Supreme Courts of the States and the Northern Territory, with other courts having some powers to apply the securities legislation.

== Definitions ==

A security is "a thing in action", a claim enforceable by legal proceedings rather than owning some tangible property. To effect regulation the legislation adopts various definitions of "security" and "financial product" that are used.

There is also no law which stipulates that no person in which authority is not given (anyone other the law enforcement or owners of an establishment) may restrict persons entering and leaving a premises.

== Licensing ==

Only the holder of a market licence may operate a financial market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s791a.html ''Corporations Act'' 2001, s 791A].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial intermediaries ===

A person who carries on a financial services business in the jurisdiction must hold an Australian financial services licence.&lt;ref&gt;''Corporations Act'', s 911A(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market misconduct ==

Prevention of fraud and other forms of market misconduct has its foundation in the [[efficient-market hypothesis]].

General common law prohibitions against interfering with the free public market&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''R v de Berenger'' (1814) 3 Maule &amp; S 67; 105 ER 536. See also "Notaras &amp; Anor v Hugh &amp; Ors" [2003] NSWSC 167.&lt;/ref&gt; are strengthened by statutory prohibitions against various forms of market misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;''Corporations Act'' 2001 Part 7.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

One set of statutory prohibitions is upon trading activity which manipulates market prices.&lt;ref&gt;Corporations Act, s 1041A.&lt;/ref&gt; There are further prohibitions upon conduct that involves false trading or market rigging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s1041b.html] ''Corporations Act'' 2001, s 1041B.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=October 2010}}
'''Business analytics''' ('''BA''') refers to the skills, technologies, practices for continuous iterative exploration and investigation of past business performance to gain insight and drive business planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title= Next Generation Business Analytics
 |url= http://www.docstoc.com/docs/7486045/Next-Generation-Business-Analytics-Presentation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business analytics focuses on developing new insights and understanding of business performance based on [[data]] and [[Statistics|statistical methods]]. In contrast, [[business intelligence]] traditionally focuses on using a consistent set of metrics to both measure past performance and guide business planning, which is also based on data and statistical methods.{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the two sentences|date=October 2017}}

Business [[analytics]] makes extensive use of statistical analysis, including explanatory and [[predictive modeling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.citi.uconn.edu/cist07/5c.pdf | title=Predictive vs. Explanatory Modeling in IS Research | author=Galit Schmueli and Otto Koppius | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011082717/http://www.citi.uconn.edu/cist07/5c.pdf | archivedate=2010-10-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fact-based management to drive [[decision making]]. It is therefore closely related to [[management science]]. Analytics may be used as input for human decisions or may drive fully automated decisions. Business intelligence is [[Information retrieval|querying]], [[report]]ing, [[online analytical processing]] (OLAP), and "alerts."

In other words, querying, reporting, OLAP, and alert tools can answer questions such as what happened, how many, how often, where the problem is, and what actions are needed. Business analytics can answer questions like why is this happening, what if these trends continue, what will happen next (predict), and what is the best outcome that can happen (optimize).&lt;ref name=Davenport2007&gt;{{Cite book

==Examples of application==
Banks, such as [[Capital One]], use [[data analysis]] (or ''[[analytics]]'', as it is also called in the business setting), to differentiate among customers based on [[credit risk]], usage and other characteristics and then to match customer characteristics with appropriate product offerings. [[Harrah's Entertainment|Harrah’s]], the gaming firm, uses analytics in its [[customer loyalty]] programs. [[E &amp; J Gallo Winery]] quantitatively analyses and predicts the appeal of its wines. Between 2002 and 2005, [[Deere &amp; Company]] saved more than $1 billion by employing a new analytical tool to better optimize inventory.&lt;ref name="Davenport2007"/&gt;  A telecoms company that pursues efficient call center usage over customer service may save money as well.

==Types of analytics==
&lt;!-- Need to expand descriptions in this section --&gt;
* Decision Analytics: supports human decisions with visual analytics that the user models to reflect reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analytics List|url=http://www.rhbs.me/about-rh/|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Descriptive Analytics: gains insight from historical data with [[reporting (disambiguation)|reporting]], scorecards, [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] etc.
* [[Predictive Analytics]]: employs [[predictive modelling]] using statistical and [[machine learning]] techniques
* [[Prescriptive Analytics]]: recommends decisions using optimization, simulation, etc.

==History==
Analytics have been used in business since the management exercises were put into place by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] in the late 19th century. [[Henry Ford]] measured the time of each component in his newly established assembly line. But analytics began to command more attention in the late 1960s when computers were used in [[decision support systems]]. Since then, analytics have changed and formed with the development of [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems, [[data warehouses]], and a large number of other software tools and processes.&lt;ref name="Davenport2007"/&gt;

In later years the business analytics have exploded with the introduction to computers. This change has brought analytics to a whole new level and has brought about endless possibilities. As far as analytics has come in history, and what the current field of analytics is today, many people would never think that analytics started in the early 1900s with Mr. Ford himself.

==Challenges==
Business analytics depends on sufficient volumes of high quality data. The difficulty in ensuring data quality is integrating and reconciling data across different systems, and then deciding what subsets of data to make available.&lt;ref name="Davenport2007"/&gt;

Previously, analytics was considered a type of after-the-fact method of [[forecasting]] [[consumer behavior]] by examining the number of units sold in the last quarter or the last year. This type of data warehousing required a lot more storage space than it did speed. Now business analytics is becoming a tool that can influence the outcome of customer interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/best-storage-business-analytic.aspx |title= Choosing the Best Storage for Business Analytics |publisher= Dell.com |accessdate= 2012-06-25 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120718204914/http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/best-storage-business-analytic.aspx |archivedate= 2012-07-18 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a specific customer type is considering a purchase, an analytics-enabled enterprise can modify the sales pitch to appeal to that consumer. This means the storage space for all that data must react extremely fast to provide the necessary data in real-time.

==Competing on analytics==
[[Thomas H. Davenport|Thomas Davenport]], professor of information technology and management at [[Babson College]] argues that businesses can optimize a distinct business capability via analytics and thus better compete. He identifies these characteristics of an organization that are apt to compete on analytics:&lt;ref name="Davenport2007"/&gt;
* One or more senior executives who strongly advocate fact-based decision making and, specifically, analytics
* Widespread use of not only [[descriptive statistics]], but also predictive modeling and complex [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] techniques
* Substantial use of analytics across multiple business functions or processes
* Movement toward an enterprise level approach to managing analytical tools, data, and organizational skills and capabilities

'''Clarence Ernest Eldridge''' (June 24, 1888 – February 7, 1981) was a [[Major League Baseball]] [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] in the [[American League]] and an advertising executive. Eldridge was a newspaper writer in college, acquiring the nickname "Dope." He practiced law before beginning his career in baseball umpiring. Eldridge umpired his first major league game on June 24, {{by|1914}}, his only game in 1914. He returned the following year to umpire five games. All six of his career major league games umpired were at first base.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/E/Peldrc901.htm Retrosheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his umpiring career, he worked as an advertising manager for the [[REO Motor Car Company]], a vice president of [[Young &amp; Rubicam]], vice president in charge of marketing for [[General Foods]], and executive vice president of the [[Campbell Soup Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%20Disk3/Poughkeepsie%20NY%20New%20Yorker/Poughkeepsie%20NY%20New%20Yorker%201941.pdf/Poughkeepsie%20NY%20New%20Yorker%201941%20-%201438.pdf#xml=http://fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=ffffffffe5a54102&amp;DocId=8958673&amp;Index=Z%3a%2fFulton%20Historical&amp;HitCount=24&amp;hits=1b8+2c4+2c6+2d3+2d5+2f9+31c+31d+37c+3b0+3cb+3d3+413+436+497+4c7+51c+57a+59a+59e+605+64e+654+696+&amp;SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&amp;.pdf POUGHKEEPSIE NEW YORKER Poughkeepsie New Yorker, September 26, 1941]&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into the [[American Advertising Federation Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advertisinghalloffame.org/members/member_bio.php?memid=610 American Advertising Federation Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/11/obituaries/clarence-e-eldridge-92-general-foods-executive-clarence-e-eldridge-92-general.html New York Times obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early career==
Eldridge grew up in Kalamazoo and attended the [[University of Michigan]]. He served as a writer and managing editor for the ''University of Michigan Daily''. He even left school briefly in 1907 for a stint as the sporting editor at the ''Arkansas Gazette''. Eldridge umpired Michigan baseball games, managed the 1909 Michigan Wolverines baseball team and worked as a college football referee in Michigan and surrounding states. Eldridge umpired minor league baseball in the Southern League, Southern Michigan League and Central League between 1907 and 1910.&lt;ref name=pittsburgh&gt;{{cite news| last =Woodruff| first =Harvey

In spite of his varied extracurricular pursuits, Eldridge managed to earn an undergraduate degree from Michigan in 1909 and a law degree from the school in 1911.&lt;ref name=pittsburgh/&gt;

==After law school==
After completing the law degree, Eldridge became a practicing attorney in Chicago. He kept a watchful eye out for umpiring opportunities, however. He was quoted as saying that he knew that he should stick to law, but that he might rather umpire. "A regular position has not been offered me in the major leagues. I hope it isn't. I am almost afraid of my choice," he said. Eldridge would serve as a substitute umpire in a total of six MLB games over the 1914 and 1915 seasons.&lt;ref name=pittsburgh/&gt;

'''Credit agreements in South Africa''' are agreements or contracts in South Africa in terms of which payment or repayment by one party (the debtor) to another (the creditor) is deferred. This entry discusses the core elements of credit agreements as defined in the National Credit Act, and the consequences of concluding a credit agreement in South Africa.

== Definitions of types of credit transactions ==
It is essential that the meanings of important terms used in the practice of consumer law are clearly understood. Most of the definitions below are obtained from the National Credit Act 34 of 2005 (“the Act”).

=== Agreement ===
An “agreement” simply means a contract.

=== Credit ===
“Credit” means a deferral or delay of payment of a sum of money to another person, or a promise to pay money.

The critical role of credit in the economy is explained in the August 2004 policy framework of the Department of Trade and Industry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Credit enables people to have use of a product or service, at a cost represented by an interest rate, prior to their having paid for that product or service or, where an item cannot be afforded from a single month’s salary, to spread payments over a number of months.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This document goes on to describe credit as a “double-edged sword,” because of the “considerable imbalance of power between consumers and credit providers,” due to poor consumer education levels and knowledge of consumer rights, and inability to enforce such rights through negotiation or legal action:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Credit cannot therefore be seen as a universal basic service to which access should be extended in the same way as access to water, health care and electricity. There is a greater need to balance access to credit with protection for consumers, especially the vulnerable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Credit provider ===
A credit provider is the party who supplies goods or services (in terms of an instalment sale agreement, for example), or who pays money (in terms, for example, of a secured or unsecured money loan, overdraft facility, pawn transaction or mortgage loan). The credit provider is often also referred to as “the creditor,” in particular when steps are taken to recover amounts due from the consumer.

=== Consumer ===
A consumer is the party to whom goods or services are sold, or to whom money is loaned in any of the examples referred to above. When steps are taken to recover amounts due, the consumer is often referred to as “the debtor.”

=== Credit agreement ===
An agreement is a credit agreement if it provides for a deferral or delay of payment, and if there is a fee or interest charged for the deferred payment. The Act does not require that a credit agreement be in writing and signed by both parties, although this is implied throughout the Act. A credit agreement may be a credit facility, a credit transaction or a credit guarantee (or a combination of these). These three terms are defined in section 8 of the Act.

==== Credit facility ====
A credit facility is an agreement in terms of which a credit provider supplies goods or services, or pays an amount to the consumer. The consumer's obligation to pay the price or repay the money is deferred, in exchange for which the consumer pays interest and fees. Examples of a credit facility are credit advanced

* on an overdrawn cheque account in terms of an overdraft facility; or
* on a credit card account.

==== Credit transaction ====
A “credit transaction” may refer any one of a number of different types of transactions. Most important for present purposes are the follow

===== Instalment agreements =====
In terms of instalment agreements, movable goods (like furniture, clothing or a car) are sold, the price is paid in instalments, and the item is delivered to the consumer. The consumer becomes owner only once all instalments have been paid.

===== Unsecured money loans =====
Unsecured money loans are usually smaller money loans (micro-loans) re-payable in instalments, where the lender is given no security for re-payment of the debt.

===== Pawn transactions =====
In terms of pawn transactions, money is lent and the borrower provides an item of property as security, the resale value of which is greater than the loan. The creditor is entitled to sell the property if the money is not repaid by an agreed date, and to keep the proceeds of the sale.

===== Mortgage agreements =====
Mortgage agreements are money loans secured by the registration of a mortgage bond over land, the proceeds of which are usually used to buy land or housing.

===== Secured loans =====
In terms of secured loans, money is paid, and the credit provider receives a pledge of any movable property or something else of value as security for repayment of the loan.

===== Leases of movable goods =====
Leases of movable goods—that is, not land or housing—would include, for example, a telefax machine or a motor car, with rent being paid in instalments, together with fees and interest. (If interest and fees are not charged, it will not be a credit transaction in terms of the Act). The total instalments will usually amount to the value of the item let. Once all instalments are paid, ownership passes to the consumer. This is contrary to the common law of lease. If, however, the agreement provides that ownership will always remain with the lessor, it will still be a credit transaction in terms of the Act.

==== Credit guarantees ====
In terms of a credit guarantee, a third party agrees to pay to a creditor the amount due by a consumer, on demand (as, for example, in the case of suretyship, in terms of which personal security is provided for the debt of another person resulting from an overdrawn cheque account).

==== Incidental credit agreements ====
Incidental credit agreements occur when goods or services are provided to a consumer over a period of time and a fee or interest is charged only if payment is not made by an agreed date. Examples include

* accounts for municipal services, such as water or electricity; and
* sales of clothing where no interest is charged provided that the account is paid by a certain date.

Incidental credit agreements do not fall under the definition of credit agreements in the Act. Section 5 sets out the limited provisions of the Act applicable to them.

A number of other agreements are not regarded as credit agreements by the Act, including

* transactions between a [[stokvel]] (a voluntary association involving a rotating financial scheme with entertainment, social or economic functions) and its members;
* an insurance policy; and
* a lease of immovable property.

== National Credit Act ==
The National Credit Act is a complicated and lengthy piece of legislation that tries to regulate closely every sector of the consumer credit market. The last provisions of the Act became effective on June 1, 2007. The Act repealed the Usury Act&lt;ref&gt;Act 73 of 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Credit Agreements Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 75 of 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and bears very little resemblance to these Acts. It represents a clean break from the past. All consumer credit law is contained within the Act, which applies to all credit agreements and all credit providers.

The Act has the ambitious and extremely difficult objective of promoting a competitive, efficient and effective credit industry and market which is at the same time fair, transparent, responsible and accessible. The overriding theme of the Act is consumer protection. Section 3 of the Act sets out a number of methods that the Act adopts to achieve this.

=== Important consumer credit institutions ===

==== National Credit Regulator ====
Much of the responsibility for implementing the purposes of the Act lies with the National Credit Regulator (NCR), which oversees the entire consumer credit industry, including all the functions and responsibilities of the former Micro-finance Regulatory Council (in the micro-lending context). The NCR is an independent organisation governed by a Board, with a Chief Executive Officer who may appoint inspectors and investigators.

The NCR has an enormous number of responsibilities. These are set out in great detail in sections 13 to 18 of the Act. It remains to be seen whether or not it will have the necessary capacity to perform all these functions. Its responsibilities include

* the promotion and development of a credit market accessible to all;
* monitoring and reporting annually certain market trends to the Minister;
* conducting research and proposing policies to the Minister regarding the consumer credit industry;
* regulating the industry by registering credit providers, credit bureaux and debt counsellors, and suspending or cancelling registration;
* enforcing the Act in numerous ways listed in section 15;
* promoting public awareness of consumer credit matters in various ways listed in section 16 (consumer education);
* engaging with provincial regulatory authorities;
* advising the Minister; and
* recommending and reporting to the Minister on various aspects of consumer credit practice, policy and legislation.

==== National Consumer Tribunal ====
The National Consumer Tribunal is an independent body, separate from the NCR. It has jurisdiction throughout South Africa, and comprises a chairperson and at least ten other members appointed by the President. A tribunal of record, it conducts its proceedings in public in an informal, inquisitorial manner. It applies principles of natural justice, and has the function of ruling on any matter brought before it in terms of the Act. The Act provides rules of practice, procedure, evidence and a list of possible orders in relation to the Tribunal.

The powers of the Tribunal are mentioned throughout the Act, the most important of which are

* to hear cases of alleged contraventions of the Act, mostly by credit providers;
* to impose fines;
* to make orders reflecting resolutions agreed in other fora; and
* to function as an appeal body. (Decisions of the NCR, for example, may be taken on appeal to the Tribunal.)

==== Registers ====
The NCR is required to establish and maintain two important registers:

# a register of certain persons; and
# a national register of credit agreements.

===== Register of certain persons =====
Credit providers, credit bureaux and debt counsellors are required to register with the NCR. Before a credit provider enters into a credit agreement (threshold is R zero) it has to register with the NCR.

The NCR has the power to suspend or cancel registration in certain circumstances.

Any person may access this register on the NCR website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncr.org.za.|title=Home|website=www.ncr.org.za.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or may obtain a copy of an extract from the register on payment of a fee. Any person may also obtain a copy of a registration certificate on payment of a fee.

Credit providers and credit bureaux were required to register with the NCR by July 28, 2006. Debt counsellors may register at any time.

===== National register of credit agreements =====
The NCR may be required by the Minister to establish a single national register of outstanding credit agreements, but it has not done so yet. Once established, credit providers will have to submit the following information in relation to every credit agreement:

* names and addresses of the credit provider and the consumer;
* the registration number of the credit provider;
* the identity number of the consumer;
* the principal debt under a credit agreement;
* the credit limit under a credit facility; and
* the amount and schedule of the monthly instalments payable.

Certain information regarding credit agreements entered into prior to the coming into effect of the Act must also be provided. This register will be accessible to any person on application in the prescribed form. It will also provide a way of monitoring South Africa's consumer debt levels, which the NCR is required to do.

==== Credit bureaux ====
A credit bureau is an entity that is engaged for payment in the business of receiving reports or investigating credit applications and agreements, payment history or patterns, and other consumer credit information. Credit bureaux are also in the business of compiling and maintaining data and issuing reports concerning consumers based on this data. As indicated above, credit bureaux were required to register with the NCR by July 28, 2006. Credit bureaux assist credit providers with information that could prevent over-indebtedness of consumers and the granting of reckless credit.

==== Debt counsellors ====
Debt counsellors are not defined in the Act. The NCR's “Debt Counsellor Training Program Learners’ Guide” describes the debt counsellor as “a registrant who is required to do certain tasks stipulated in the Act—including facilitating, investigating, and recommending solutions for over-indebtedness.”

Debt counsellors have a number of functions which appear throughout the Act. The main role of debt counsellors is to evaluate consumers’ indebtedness (upon referral of the consumer by a court, or upon application by the consumer directly to the debt counsellor). The debt counsellor may then recommend to the court

* that the consumer is over-indebted;
* that one or more credit agreements are reckless (and should be set aside or suspended); and
* that the consumer's debts be re-structured.

This procedure is explained in more detail below.

Debt counsellors must apply to the NCR to be registered as such. The Act contains a lengthy list of reasons for disqualification as a debt counsellor. In addition, the Regulations provide that debt counsellors must

* have a Grade-12 or equivalent qualification;
* complete an NCR-approved debt counselling course;
* have a minimum of 2 years’ working experience in certain fields; and
* show an ability to manage their own finances, and to provide counselling or transfer skills.

==== Consumer courts ====
Consumer courts are tribunals established by provincial legislation. The Act allows these courts to be used in various circumstances. There is only one instance where these courts operate at the same level as the National Consumer Tribunal, which is when the NCR refers a complaint to it. Most provinces have introduced their own legislation, but only Gauteng presently has a properly-functioning consumer court.

==== Ombuds ====
The Act uses the gender-neutral term “ombud” (often known as ombudsman). The Act provides that certain disputes between a financial institution (like a bank) and a consumer, arising from a credit agreement, may be referred to the relevant ombud. The ombud will then act as mediator between the institution and the consumer with a complaint.

== Conclusion of credit agreements ==

=== Pre-agreement disclosure ===
Before concluding a credit agreement, the credit provider must give to the consumer, free of charge, a statement and quotation in the form prescribed by the Regulations (Form 20 to the Regulations, in the case of small credit agreements). No agreement is entered into at this stage; the consumer does not have to sign anything or pay any fee. This is a new development in the law, designed to protect consumers. This document must contain the financial details of the proposed agreement (like the amount of credit provided, the number and amount of instalments payable, interest and other fees, deposit required and credit insurance). Consumers must accept or reject the quotation within five days, giving them a chance to shop around for better or cheaper credit. Once the consumer has accepted the quotation, the credit agreement itself can then be concluded.

=== Form and contents of credit agreements ===
The form of the document that records the credit agreement is prescribed by regulation, and varies for different-size credit agreements. The details required for a small credit agreement (a principal debt of less than R15 000) are set out in Form 20.2 to the Regulations. This is not really a form, but rather a framework for the minimum contents of the agreement. These details include

* the parties’ personal particulars;
* the financial details of the agreement (similar to those required for the pre-agreement disclosure above); and
* certain of the consumer's statutory rights and duties (discussed below).

The credit provider must give to the consumer, free of charge, a copy of the signed credit agreement (in paper form or printable electronic form).

Credit agreements may be altered only in very specific circumstances, most importantly in relation to the reduction or increase in credit limits.

== Rights and duties of consumers and credit providers ==
Many consumer rights are contained in the Act, but very few rights for credit providers. (By contrast, credit providers have many duties.) The Act is biased towards consumers, because it seeks to redress imbalances inherent in our common law. This is not unusual for legislation of this kind.

=== Right to apply for credit and non-discrimination ===
Every adult person has the right to apply for credit, but no-one has the right to be granted credit. A credit grantor may choose to refuse credit for reasonable business reasons, but may not unfairly discriminate against a consumer relative to other consumers on the grounds of race, religion, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, culture, language, etc. A consumer may ask for reasons for the refusal of credit, which must be given by the credit provider in writing.

=== Right to understandable language ===
The consumer has the right to be given a quotation and credit agreement in an official language that he reads or understands, to the extent that this is reasonable. Any documents where no form is prescribed must be in plain language (language which an ordinary consumer with average literacy skills and minimal credit experience will understand).

=== Rights regarding information held by credit bureaux ===
Credit bureaux have an important role. For example, they provide credit providers with information on the creditworthiness of consumers. This information could, of course, be damaging to consumers. Credit bureaux are therefore obliged to check with other sources that the information given to them by credit providers is correct. Consumers have the right to have information relating to rescinded judgments expunged (removed) from the records of credit bureaux. Likewise, a consumer who has satisfied all his obligations in terms of a debt rearrangement has the right to have the fact that a debt rearrangement previously existed removed from these records.

A credit provider must advise a debtor before reporting unfavourable information to a credit bureau. Any person may challenge the accuracy of any information reported to or held by a credit bureau. The credit bureau or NCR is then obliged to investigate at no charge and rectify any incorrect information.

The regulations prescribe maximum periods of time that different categories of consumer credit information may be retained by credit bureaux. For example, civil judgments may be retained for the earliest of

* five years;
* until date of rescission by a court; or
* abandonment by credit provider.

Anyone has the right to a free credit bureau report once per year. After that it will cost R20 per enquiry. Two important credit bureaux, with contact numbers, are:
• ITC — 086 148 2482 (Website: www.mycredit.co.za).
• Experian — 086 110 5665 (Website: www.creditexpert.co.za)

=== Protection against marketing practices ===
The Act contains a number of rules in this regard:

* The advertising and marketing of credit must contain prescribed information on the cost of credit (interest and all other charges).
* Negative-option marketing (in terms of which an agreement will automatically come into existence unless the consumer declines an offer) is not permitted.
* Advertisements must not be misleading, fraudulent or deceptive.
* Credit providers may not harass anyone, or try to coerce or persuade anyone to apply for credit.
* Credit sales at a person's home are strictly prohibited, unless
** the sale of credit occurs during a pre-arranged visit for that purpose by the consumer; or
** the provision of credit is incidental to the sale of goods or services.
* A credit provider may require that a consumer have credit life insurance during the existence of a credit agreement, but has a duty to ensure that suitable options for insurance cover are offered to the consumer.

=== Right to confidentiality and privacy ===
Credit bureaux are required to protect the confidentiality of consumer credit information that they hold or report on. Credit providers must also present to consumers the options of being excluded from telemarketing campaigns, marketing or customer lists sold or distributed and mass distribution of e-mail or SMS messages.

=== Right of cooling-off ===
In certain circumstances, consumers may terminate agreements (in writing and properly delivered) within five business days of signing them. This cooling-off right applies only to leases and instalment agreements that are concluded at a location other than the registered business premises of the credit provider. Typically, this right will apply to credit sales on instalments (as in the cases of cars, books, household appliances) concluded at the consumer's home or place of work. The consumer must return the goods bought, and the credit provider must refund amounts paid by the consumer within seven days of termination, less the following:

* reasonable costs of return and repair of damages after sale;
* rent for use of the goods, unless they are still in their original packaging; and
* compensation for depreciation in value of the goods (by agreement or court order only).

=== Early settlement and repayments ===
Consumers are entitled to settle their debts in advance at any time, with or without advance notice, after requesting a statement from the credit provider of the amount required to settle the account. No settlement charge is payable for small agreements; interest and other fees are payable only until date of settlement. This means that a consumer may request from the credit provider the balance due, pay the entire amount, and not be penalised for doing so.

This, however, does not apply to large agreements such as mortgage bonds. If a consumer wishes to settle a bond he must first give notice of cancellation for a period of three months to the credit provider. When a mortgage bond is cancelled, the consumer will be liable for bond cancellation costs.

Consumers may prepay any amount due under a credit agreement (e.g. instalments due) and credit providers are obliged to accept such amounts, even if they are not due. Such payments are used for unpaid interest and fees first, and then to reduce the principal debt.

=== Surrender of goods ===
A consumer may, at any time, return to a credit provider goods that are subject to a credit agreement, whether or not the consumer is in default. The credit provider must then sell the goods and use the proceeds to settle the account. In terms of the former Credit Agreements Act, this procedure applied only when the consumer was in default. This new provision gives the consumer an extraordinary right, enabling him to rid himself of the agreement when he chooses to.

The following procedure must be followed if the consumer elects to enforce this right:

# The consumer must notify the credit provider in writing of the termination of the agreement, and return the goods to the credit provider.
# If the credit provider is already in possession of the goods, the consumer may require the credit provider to sell the goods.
# The credit provider must notify the consumer within ten days of the estimated value of the goods.
# Once the consumer receives this notice of estimated value, he may withdraw his notice of termination within ten days, and resume possession of the goods, unless he is in default under the agreement.
# If the consumer does not respond to the credit provider's notice of estimated value within ten days, the credit provider must sell the goods as soon as possible for the best price possible.
# After the goods have been sold, the credit provider must credit or debit the consumer's account with the proceeds of the sale, less the reasonable costs of the sale.
# The credit provider must give to the consumer a notice indicating the settlement amount before the sale, the amount realised by the sale, and the net proceeds of the sale (after deduction of default charges and the costs of the sale).
# If the result of the sale is a credit balance on the account, this amount must be repaid to the consumer. If there is a debit balance, the credit provider may demand and, if necessary, sue the consumer for the outstanding balance.
# If the consumer is not satisfied that the goods were sold as soon as possible or for the best price possible, he may attempt to resolve the dispute with the credit provider, or through alternative-dispute methods, or through referral to the National Consumer Tribunal. The Tribunal may award the consumer an additional amount if this is deemed necessary.

=== Statements of account ===
The Act contains detailed provisions regarding statements of account. The Regulations prescribe the form and content of statements in the case of small agreements. Credit providers must deliver to consumers periodic statements of account, usually once a month (but once every two months for instalment sale agreements).

Credit providers are also obliged to provide consumers with statements of account on request, at no charge. The consumer may choose how the statement must be delivered:

* orally (in person, or by telephone); or
* in writing (in person, by SMS, by mail, by fax or by email—provided that the credit provider has these facilities).

Credit providers need not give written statements on demand more than once every three months.

=== Right to apply for debt review and re-structuring of debt ===
These provisions are explained in detail below.

=== Duty to report location of goods ===
In the case of certain credit agreements (typically instalment agreements), the consumer becomes the owner only once the full purchase price has been paid, and the credit provider has a right to repossession on breach of the agreement. Until then, the credit provider has an interest in the whereabouts of the goods.

The consumer has a duty to inform the credit provider of any of the following changes:

* changes of business or residential address;
* changes of the premises where the goods are kept; and
* changes of the name and address of any other person who has possession of the goods.

The consumer must also give to the credit provider or sheriff, on request, the address where the goods are kept, and the name and address of the landlord of the premises.

=== Rights of credit providers ===
The credit provider's most important rights are

* the right to enforce the agreement;
* the right to receive payment of the credit extended, together with agreed interest and fees; and,
* upon breach of contract, the right to cancel the agreement and recover any goods sold.

A credit provider may suspend a credit facility (like a credit card or cheque account) at any time if the consumer is in default, or otherwise close the facility on ten business days’ notice.

A credit provider who has incurred costs in the attachment of goods while enforcing a debt may ask a court to order the consumer to pay the costs of attachment. The court will make such an order only if the consumer provided false information about his address or the location of the goods.

=== Duties of credit providers ===
Every consumer right entails a duty on the part of credit providers. The duties on credit providers are onerous; they provide many administrative burdens. Some of the credit provider's more important duties are

* to register as a credit provider once it has 100 credit agreements or a book debt of R500,000;
* to make a credit assessment of the consumer;
* to give to the consumer a pre-agreement statement and quotation;
* to give to the consumer a copy of the agreement;
* to give to the consumer periodic statements of account, and further statements on request;
* to protect the confidentiality of information about consumers;
* to report to the NCR, or to a credit bureau, the details of every credit agreement concluded, as well as the termination of the agreement when the debt has been paid in full;
* to propose to the consumer to seek advice when the consumer is in default;
* to maintain records of credit applications, agreements and accounts as prescribed in the Regulations;
* to sell goods subject to a credit agreement as soon as possible, for the best price possible, should the consumer request it, and to provide the consumer with a financial statement.

== Over-indebtedness and reckless credit ==
Over-indebtedness is frequently a disastrous consequence of the high cost of credit. Levenstein summarises this state of affairs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unfortunately, in South Africa, too many people with too little money have been given too much credit. This ultimately leads to over-indebtedness which results in a never-ending circle of frustration for the consumer who can never repay his debts.&lt;ref&gt;Without Prejudice (2006) 6 at page 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Department of Trade and Industry's 2004 policy framework describes credit as “a double-edged sword:”

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whilst credit allows access to products or services that cannot be acquired out of a single month’s income, it can also be a dangerous instrument that can lead to high levels of debt and indebtedness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is quite easy for credit to lead to financial hardship and destroy a household’s wealth. Taking on extra loans in order to pay back existing loans can lead people into a debt spiral out of which it may be difficult to escape. Over-indebtedness has a negative impact on families and has in some extreme cases even led to family suicides. Over-indebtedness further has an impact upon the workplace, can lead to de-motivation, absenteeism and even a propensity to commit theft.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A Human Sciences Research Council survey on household indebtedness in South Africa showed that, in 2000, over sixty per cent of the regular disposable income of households earning less than R5,000 per year was used to service debt: that is, to pay interest on debt. Levels of indebtedness increased by more than 200 per cent between 1995 and 2000 in the poorest households, with incomes of less than R25,000 per year. This trend seems to have continued since.

It has been argued that consumers are often to blame for allowing themselves to become over-indebted by unwisely borrowing too much money, or by buying too much on credit. This is usually the result of economic desperation and lack of understanding of the difficulties of repaying or servicing their debt. Credit providers are, however, often to blame for recklessly giving too much credit to consumers who cannot afford to service their debt. One of the most important objectives of the Act is to combat over-indebtedness and reckless credit granting. Sections 78 to 88 of the Act contain detailed, far-reaching and extremely important provisions in this regard.

=== Over-indebtedness ===
A consumer is over-indebted if the available information indicates that the consumer is unable to pay the amounts due under a credit agreement in time. When deciding whether or not a consumer is over-indebted, a court must consider the consumer's

*  financial means (primarily income);
* financial prospects (income-earning potential);
* other debt; and
* history of debt repayment.

In any court proceedings, a court may declare a consumer to be over-indebted. Alternatively, a debt counsellor may have a role in one of two ways:

# A court may refer a consumer to a debt counsellor for a recommendation as to whether or not the consumer is over-indebted.
# A consumer may apply in person to a debt counsellor to be declared over-indebted (although this is not permitted if the credit provider has already taken steps to recover the debt). The consumer must apply by completing and submitting Form 16 to the Regulations. The consumer must provide details of the debt and pay a fee of R50 to the debt counsellor.

A debt review must then take place. The debt counsellor must notify all credit providers and credit bureaux listed in the application; they must co-operate fully with the debt counsellor. The debt counsellor must then evaluate the consumer's indebtedness. The evaluation can have one of three possible results:

# The consumer is over-indebted. The debt counsellor may recommend to the magistrate's court thatone or more credit agreements be declared reckless, and/or that one or more of the consumer's debts be re-arranged (for example, by extending the period of a contract and requiring smaller payments, and/or by postponing the dates of payments).
# The consumer is not over-indebted, but is having difficulty paying his debts on time. The counsellor may recommend that the consumer and credit providers try voluntarily to agree on a plan of debt re-arrangement, which may be filed as a consent order in court. If no agreement can be reached, the debt counsellor may make a recommendation to the court, which may make an appropriate order.
# The consumer is not over-indebted, and the application is rejected. The consumer may then apply himself to the magistrate's court for a debt review by completing and submitting Form 18 to the Regulations.

A credit agreement may be declared to be reckless only if the consumer is found to be over- indebted. If the debt counsellor finds that the consumer is not over-indebted, but is of the view that one or more credit agreements are reckless, these agreements may not be declared to be reckless. Credit providers may therefore still enforce credit agreements that are in fact reckless, but they may not be formally declared to be reckless.

While this process is under way, a consumer may not use his credit facility (for example, his credit card); nor may he enter into another credit agreement. A credit provider who enters into a credit agreement with a consumer while the consumer is under debt review runs the risk of the credit agreement's being declared reckless credit.

Also, if a consumer is in default under a credit agreement, and the credit provider has already commenced debt-enforcement proceedings, that agreement may not be subject to the debt review. This could encourage credit providers to start proceedings to recover debt earlier than they otherwise might have done.

The debt-review procedure might well be used by shrewd consumers to delay or avoid payment under a credit agreement. This is so because there are many provisions in the Act which limit the rights of credit providers to enforce debts under review. However, if the consumer is in default under a credit agreement subject to review, the credit provider may give notice to the consumer, the debt counsellor and the NCR to terminate the review. This notice may be given at least sixty days after the date of application for debt review: that is, if the debt-review process is dragging on too long. The credit provider may then take steps to enforce the agreement. The court then has the discretion to order that the debt review resume if appropriate. Finally, it should be noted that an application for debt review by a consumer has serious implications for the consumer as to his creditworthiness and the conclusion of future agreements.

=== Reckless credit ===
A credit provider must not enter into a reckless credit agreement with a consumer. Before entering into a credit agreement, a credit provider must first take reasonable steps to assess the consumer's

* general understanding of the risks and costs of the proposed credit;
* debt repayment history; and
* existing financial means, prospects and obligations.

A credit agreement is reckless

* if, at the time it was concluded, the credit provider failed to conduct the necessary assessment (described above), irrespective of what the outcome of the assessment might have been; or
* if the credit provider entered into the agreement despite the fact that information available to the credit provider after the assessment showed that
** the consumer did not generally understand the consumer's risk and the costs or obligations under the proposed credit agreement; or
** the conclusion of the agreement would cause the consumer to become over-indebted.

This provision helps to prevent credit providers from taking shortcuts by simply accepting seemingly creditworthy debtors at face value. A credit provider may use its own assessment mechanisms, provided these are fair and objective. The consumer, in turn, must fully and truthfully provide the requested information. Failure by the consumer to do so could provide the credit provider with a complete defence to an allegation of reckless credit granting.

In any proceedings that concern credit agreements, a court may declare that a credit agreement is reckless, in which case the court may make an order

* setting aside all or part of the consumer's rights and obligations under that agreement (so that, for example, the consumer may not have to repay a loan or pay the instalments on a credit sale at all); or
* suspending the force and effect of the agreement for a specific period.

If a court declares that a specific credit agreement is reckless, it must also decide whether or not the consumer is over-indebted at the time of the court proceedings. All the debt of the consumer must be considered. If the court finds the consumer to be over-indebted, it may make an order

* suspending the force and effect of that agreement for a specific period; and
* restructuring the consumer's obligations under any other credit agreements.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;See above.&lt;/ref&gt;

While an agreement is suspended (not set aside),

* the consumer is not required to pay anything in terms of the credit agreement;
* no interest or fee may be debited to the consumer; and
* the credit provider's rights in terms of the agreement are unenforceable.

After the period of suspension ends, all the parties’ rights and obligations are revived and become enforceable again. However, interest or fees that would normally have accrued during the period of suspension may not be charged to the consumer. This is a drastic remedy indeed.

The reckless-credit provisions do not apply to a number of credit agreements, including

* a school loan;
* a student loan; and
* an emergency loan.

A student loan, for example, could be granted to an unemployed consumer, who might not have a credit record (so that the credit provider does not know his payment history). The consumer might not be creditworthy, and there is no security. The nature of these agreements excludes them from being reckless lending.

The negative results for credit providers of either

* contracting with over-indebted consumers; or
* concluding reckless credit agreements

are serious. Many of the provisions are designed to penalise credit providers. Credit providers will be very careful to reduce the risk of bad debt. These provisions are therefore likely to reduce over-indebtedness and reckless credit granting, at least in the formal sector. A negative result for consumers, however, could be that credit grantors will be much more reluctant to grant credit in the future, and that, therefore, fewer people will be able to access credit. Further, this could lead to an increase in the number of unregistered and illegal credit providers.

== The cost of credit ==
It is critical that one understand the full implications of the new cost-of-credit provisions in the
National Credit Act and Regulations.

=== Interest rates until 1 June 2007 ===
Until June 1, 2007, the Usury Act (which has now been repealed by the National Credit Act) prescribed limits on the interest rates that credit providers could charge. Until this date, the maximum interest rate was twenty per cent per year on all credit agreements up to R10,000 and seventeen per cent per year on credit agreements over R10,000. However, registered micro-lenders were made exempt from the Usury Act from 1992, meaning that they were entitled to charge whatever interest rates they liked. This resulted in exorbitant interest rates, with micro-lenders charging typically thirty per cent per month (or 360 per cent per year)—eighteen times more than the limit of twenty per cent per year for other credit. Because of the enormous profits that micro-lenders could make, the industry spiralled out of control, growing rapidly year-on-year. In the three years between September 2003 and August 2006, for example, industry disbursements more than doubled. The industry grew by an average of over thirty per cent per year. For the twelve months ending August 2006, the total Rand-value of loans disbursed in the registered micro-finance sector was over R30,000,000,000.

=== The socio-economic impact of excessive interest rates ===
Excessive interest rates have caused terrible socio-economic hardships and suffering for low-income individuals and communities. A high percentage of personal income is used to service micro-lending debt, leaving very little of borrowers’ personal income to pay for other household expenses. Borrowers on thirty-day loans in particular are very soon caught in debt traps from which they are unable to escape. Tens of billions are lost to lower-income communities in the form of interest on micro-loans every year, contributing to the perpetuation of poverty.

Levels of indebtedness are high and appear to be increasing. The problem of over-indebtedness is made worse by high levels of consumption finance and consumer ignorance and illiteracy. (32 per cent of the adult population of South Africa were functionally illiterate in 2001.) By allowing the micro-lending industry to function without legislated and enforced interest-rate limits since 1992, the Government effectively made possible the exploitation of the ignorance of lower-income communities, which arguably amounted to legislated economic abuse.

=== The cost of credit in terms of the National Credit Act ===
The National Credit Act prescribes limits on interest rates for all forms of credit, including micro-loans. However, the Act introduces other fees (the initiation fee and the service fee) which cause the total cost of credit to remain extremely high. No longer is it sufficient to consider only interest rates. Interest rates, initiation fees and service fees must all be carefully calculated in order to work out the total cost of credit for borrowers. The new cost-of-credit provisions came into force on June 1, 2007.

==== Interest ====
Different interest rates apply to different categories of credit agreements:

===== Short-term credit transactions =====
“Short-term credit transactions” are agreements up to R8,000 repayable within six months; usually these are micro-loans. The maximum interest rate permitted is five per cent per month, or sixty per cent per year.

===== Unsecured credit transactions =====
“Unsecured credit transactions” are agreements for which there is no security for the debt at all (like loans or sales on credit). There is no limit on the amount or repayment period. Unsecured agreements for more than R8,000 and/or repayable over more than six months fall into this category. The maximum interest rate is linked to the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) Repurchase Rate ((Repurchase Rate x 2.2) + 20% per year), and is currently 39,8 per cent per year (based on the current repo rate of nine per cent). This maximum rate is nearly double the maximum permissible rate in terms of the Usury Act that applied until May 31, 2007 (20 per cent per year). Sales of furniture, for example, could now cost twice as much to service.

===== Credit facilities =====
Secured bank loans, credit card or cheque accounts fall under the category “credit facility.” The maximum interest rate is also linked to the SARB Bank Repurchase Rate, and is currently 29.8 per cent per year.

===== Developmental credit agreements =====
“Developmental credit agreements” are credit agreements entered into to develop a small business, an educational loan, or a loan for purposes of building low-cost housing. The maximum interest rate is 38.8% per year.

===== Mortgage bond agreements =====
For mortgage bond agreements, the maximum interest rate is 24.9 per cent per year.

==== The initiation fee ====
The initiation fee is intended to cover the costs of initiating a credit agreement, although it is not clear exactly what costs the fee is intended to cover. It is a once-off payment made by the consumer on conclusion of the credit agreement or payable in instalments (as a separate loan attracting interest).

The maximum initiation fee in terms of the Regulations is R150 per credit agreement, plus ten per cent of the amount of the agreement in excess of R1,000, but never to exceed R1,000. Also, the initiation fee may never exceed fifteen per cent of the principal debt.

[[File:Table A - Maximum initiation fees for different size loans.png|thumb|Examples of the calculation of maximum initiation fees for different-size credit agreements.]]

It will be extremely difficult for consumers to find the necessary cash to pay the initiation fee up front at a time when they are taking out a loan precisely because they are in need of cash. Most lenders will thus be unable to afford to pay the initiation fee on taking out a loan, particularly in the case of the very poor borrowing for consumption purposes. These people will thus be forced to allow the initiation fee to be capitalised and re-paid, probably in the same number of instalments as the initial loan, and subject to the same interest rate as the initial loan. The result will be that the effective monthly cost of credit will increase.

==== The service fee ====
The service fee is defined as a fee that may be charged periodically (usually monthly) by a credit provider in connection with the routine administrative cost of maintaining a credit agreement. The maximum service fee in terms of the Regulations is R50 per month, or R600 per year. The same “flat-rate” maximum service fee of R50 is applicable to all categories and sizes of credit agreements. It appears that the service fee was standardised in order to simplify the application of the Act, justifiable on the basis that every loan, no matter what its size, needs to be administered.

[[File:Table B - The effective cost of the service fee on different size loans.png|thumb|The effect of the flat-rate service fee of R50 per month on different size loans in terms of South African law, shown as a percentage of the loan amount.]]

The smaller the loan, the more expensive will be the service fee relative to the loan. When this cost is shown as a percentage, it is clear that the service fee adds significantly to the cost of the loan, increasing rapidly with smaller and smaller loan amounts. The “flat-rate” service fee of R50 per month is exorbitant in the case of small loans of less than R1,000 and is still too high in the case of loans up to R5,000.

This result is so unfair that borrowers of very small loans (who are almost invariably from the poorest communities) will be discriminated against. The Act itself provides that the service fee must vary relative to the principal debt: that is, that it should be higher for bigger loans, and lower for smaller loans. This is not so. The Regulations should be amended to set the service fee at a percentage of the loan amount, subject to both a minimum and a maximum rand amount (as is the case for the initiation fee). Alternatively, the service fee should be scrapped on smaller credit agreements, and the maximum interest rate increased if necessary. If the service fee is not amended or scrapped, then it should be challenged in court.

==== Maximum limits and probable market costs ====
The prescribed interest rates and fees are maximum amounts only. The Department of Trade and Industry hopes that the credit industry will not “jump to the maximum rates”, and has said that it has the power to adjust these rates quickly if necessary.

The micro-lending industry in particular was born and grew on the strength of exorbitant interest rates, and many micro-lenders will struggle to stay in business with the new limits in place. It is therefore very likely that most lenders will charge the maximum rates of interest and fees to keep their profits as high as possible. Bigger lenders such as banks, on the other hand, are able to afford to be competitive, and are likely to charge lower rates.

==== The danger of masking the total cost of credit ====
The drastic reduction in interest rates has the effect of masking or obscuring the true total cost of credit when the initiation and service fees are added. It is possible that these fees could to a large extent remain hidden, with the emphasis being placed on interest rates (which are more familiar to consumers) when products are marketed. The fees help to keep interest rates lower, which makes credit look cheaper, when in fact credit may not be cheaper. The skewing of credit costs away from interest and towards fees (which are not familiar to consumers) will increase the chances of consumers’ being misled as to the actual cost of credit. Many will be lured into borrowing money which will cost much more than they had initially expected. It is essential that paralegals understand the danger of this masking of the true cost of credit, in order to be able to warn their clients of this danger.

==== The combined impact of interest, the initiation fee and the service fee ====
[[File:Table C - Illustration of the cost of credit in terms of the National Credit Regulations.png|thumb|The total cost of credit (for either short-term or unsecured loans) applied to a number of loan amounts and loan periods. The total cost of credit (for either short-term or unsecured loans) is applied here to a number of loan amounts and loan periods. The total monthly cost of credit is indicated in rands; this rand amount is indicated as a monthly percentage of the initial loan. This monthly percentage gives the most accurate possible indication of the total cost of credit in each case. The annual cost may be obtained by multiplying these figures by twelve. It is assumed for the purposes of these calculations that the maximum rates of interest and fees are charged, for the reasons explained above. It is also assumed that the total initiation fee is charged to the borrower and capitalised: that is to say, is paid off over the same period as the loan, at the same interest rate (five per cent per month if it is a short-term loan, or 3.3 per cent per month if it is an unsecured loan). If the initiation fee were regarded as a separate loan, it would attract its own initiation and service fees, which would make the initiation fee even more expensive. For the sake of simplicity, interest is not charged on unpaid interest and other fees (although this is permitted by the Act), which would make the total cost of credit even more expensive.]]

The new credit limits have a negative impact on smaller loans. The smaller the loan, the more expensive it is. A one-month loan of R500 will cost about the same as the typical thirty per cent per month charged prior to the Act. Smaller loans will be even more expensive than that. A R200 loan will cost 46 per cent per month (552 per cent per year), which is more than nine times the maximum interest of five per cent per month.

The positive impact of capped interest rates, furthermore, is negated by the high maximum initiation and service fees.

The impact of the initiation and service fees on smaller loans amounts to a skewing of the cost of credit away from interest and towards these fees, so that interest decreases relative to these fees. This skewing has the dangerous effect of masking the true cost of credit from the consumer, and of misleading the consumer.

A more equitable result could be achieved by removing or reducing the initiation and service fees, reducing the maximum permissible interest rate, and reducing the maximum size amount of short-term credit transactions. This will require amendments to the Regulations.

=== The socio-economic consequences of the new cost of credit ===
The new structure for costing of credit will work best for the biggest credit advances, in excess of R8,000. The cost of credit on agreements of less than R1,000 is comparable with the typical thirty per cent per month charged with no interest limits on small loans, The vast majority of borrowers of micro-loans are from low-income groups. The poorest households carry the greatest debt-servicing burden. Low-income individuals and communities who borrow small amounts are therefore likely to continue to suffer the same devastating socio-economic hardships referred to above, contributing to the perpetuation of poverty.

Borrowers of one-month loans are most vulnerable, since these loans are much more expensive than other short-term loans. Low-income borrowers are usually unable to afford to pay back these loans at the end of the month; repeated loans have often to be taken out to fund in full the re-payment of previous loans. Borrowers are caught in debt spirals and subsequent debt traps, with the disastrous consequence that borrowers in effect remain permanently indebted.

[[File:Table D - Illustration of the application of the new cost of credit to one-month loans and resultant debt spiral.png|thumb|The new cost of credit, applied to two examples. In each case, the cost of credit is calculated as follows: interest at 5% per month + initiation fee at 15% of loan amount (+ 5% interest per month) + service fee (always R50). In Example A, by Month 2 the loan repayment (R840) has already exceeded the old-age pension of R820. In Example B, the loan repayment in Month 3 almost exceeds the total wage. These examples confirm that debt spirals and debt traps will continue to occur on a wide scale when the new cost of credit is applied, and could prove to be one of its greatest dangers.]]

=== Conclusion ===
The National Credit Act has made great strides towards consumer protection, and the new limits on interest rates will provide welcome relief for many borrowers. The combined effect of interest, the initiation fee and the service fee will, however, cause the cost of credit on small loans to remain exorbitant. This will have a devastating negative impact on poorer individuals and communities.

== Legal remedies provided by the Act ==
The Act provides only a relatively short list of offences that attract criminal penalties. By contrast, the Usury Act provided that any person who contravenes any provision of the Act commits an offence. Thus, for example, it was a criminal offence to charge interest higher than the Usury Act maximum, which is no longer the case.

However, the Act does provide a number of civil legal remedies for consumers, some of which are drastic departures from previous law. The most important of these remedies are outlined below.

=== Unlawful credit agreements ===
Section 89 lists a number of credit agreements that are unlawful, including

* an agreement with a consumer who is a minor unassisted by a guardian;
* an agreement with a person who has been declared mentally unfit;
* an agreement with a person under an administration order without the administrator's consent;
* an agreement resulting from negative-option marketing (explained above);
* an agreement with an unregistered credit provider who was supposed to be registered (unless application for registration is made within thirty days after the credit agreement was concluded);&lt;ref&gt;See above for how to establish whether or not a credit provider is registered.&lt;/ref&gt; and
* an agreement with a credit provider who was subject to a notice by the NCR to stop extending credit.

If a credit agreement is found to be unlawful, a court must order

* that the credit agreement is void;
* that the credit provider refund to the consumer any monies paid by the consumer, with interest; and
* that the credit provider's rights to recover monies paid or goods delivered to the consumer be cancelled or forfeited to the State (if the court is of the view that the consumer would otherwise be unjustifiably enriched).

The credit provider will not get back the money lent or property sold, and the court does not have a discretion to order this. This is a drastic remedy and a departure from the common law. It was not previously available in the case of unregistered micro-lenders, and is a significant new remedy readily available to consumers.

Thus, for example, a court will be able to declare a loan from an unregistered micro-lender to be void (if the Act requires the micro-lender to be registered), and order the micro-lender to refund all instalments paid, with interest. Furthermore, the court must order that the loan amount paid to the consumer be retained by the borrower or forfeited to the State. The amount loaned is therefore lost to the unregistered micro-lender altogether.

=== Unlawful provisions of credit agreements ===
Section 90 lists numerous provisions of credit agreements (as opposed to the entire agreements&lt;ref&gt;s 89.&lt;/ref&gt;) that are unlawful and not permitted. They are too many to list here. The list is broadly-worded and far-reaching; many of the provisions will probably be open to a wide range of interpretations, which is likely to lead to uncertainty. For example, a provision is unlawful if its general purpose or effect is to defeat the purposes or policies of the Act, or to “deceive” the consumer. Further, a provision is unlawful

* if it avoids a credit provider's obligation or duty in terms of the Act;
* if it sets aside or overrides the effect of any provision of the Act;
* if it authorises the credit provider to do anything that is unlawful in terms of the Act, or to fail to do anything that is required in terms of the Act;
* if it waives or deprives a consumer of a right afforded by the Act;
* if it waives any common-law rights applicable to the credit agreement;
* if it expresses the consumer's consent to a pre-determined value of costs of enforcement of the agreement;
* if it expresses the consumer's consent to the jurisdiction of the High Court, or any court that would normally not have jurisdiction for reasons of its geographical location;
* if it provides for the consumer's depositing an identity document, credit or debit or access card, or providing a PIN;
* if it authorises a person acting on behalf of the credit provider to enter premises to repossess goods; or
* if it contains an undertaking to sign in advance any documentation relating to the enforcement of the agreement (like a consent to judgment or emoluments-attachment order).

An unlawful provision is void. Whenever a court has a matter before it which concerns a credit agreement that contains an unlawful provision, the court may

* sever (remove) the unlawful provision from the credit agreement;
* alter the provision to render it lawful; or
* even declare the whole credit agreement unlawful and make orders similar to those provided for unlawful credit agreements, set out above (another major departure from the common law).

The consumer alleging the unlawful provision is entitled to apply to court for orders in these terms.

Thus, for example, if a credit agreement for the sale of furniture provides for interest or fees in excess of the maximum amounts permissible, a court must declare the offending provisions to be void and enforce the remainder of the agreement. However, it seems that the court may be able to declare the entire agreement void, order the furniture shop to refund all amounts paid, and order that the furniture sold be retained by the borrower or forfeited to the State.

=== In duplum rule ===
The Act has codified the in duplum rule for the first time in South Africa's legislative history, and extended the rule further to include all credit costs. This rule states that, while a consumer is in default, all credit costs will stop being added to the debt when their total equals the unpaid balance of the principal debt. It is likely that increased use will be made of the rule since it has been legislated. It must be remembered, however, that it will apply only when the consumer is in default.

=== Reckless credit and over-indebtedness ===
Other legal remedies for consumers already discussed above include

* a court order declaring a loan agreement to be reckless, which could result in the setting aside of all or part of the borrower's rights and obligations under the agreement, or the suspension of the force and effect of the agreement for a determined period; and
* a finding that a consumer was over-indebted at the time of the conclusion of the agreement, in which event the court may order the suspension of the force and effect of the agreement and the restructuring of the consumer's obligations under any other credit agreements.

== Dispute settlement and debt enforcement ==

=== Dispute settlement ===
If the Act has been contravened, a person has one of two options:

# to lodge a complaint with the NCR; or
# to make use of one of the other dispute-resolution mechanisms established by the Act.

==== Lodging a complaint with the NCR ====
The Act contains detailed provisions regarding the role of the NCR.&lt;ref&gt;ss 136-141.&lt;/ref&gt; Complaints to the NCR must be lodged by completing and submitting to the NCR Form 29 to the Regulations. The NCR may resolve complaints lodged with it; the resolution may become a consent order by a court or the Tribunal. The NCR may also refer the dispute to a debt counsellor, an ombud with jurisdiction or a consumer court. After investigating the matter, the NCR may refer the matter to a provincial consumer court or the Tribunal for an order allowed by the Act.

==== Other dispute-resolution methods ====
Alternatively, disputes may be referred for resolution directly to the relevant ombud if the credit provider is a financial institution (like a bank), to a consumer court or to an alternative dispute resolution agent.&lt;ref&gt;ss 134-135.&lt;/ref&gt; With the consent of the parties, the resolution may be recorded in writing and made an order of court or the Tribunal.

In his book ''The National Credit Act Explained'', Otto concludes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;All in all, the muscle of the National Credit Regulator, the far-reaching powers of the National Consumer Tribunal and the courts, the almost paternalistic protective inclination of the legislature, and the extensive network of dispute-solving account for consumer legislation that is going to have a huge impact on the enormous credit industry in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Debt enforcement ===
The Act limits the credit provider's common-law rights to enforce debt: that is, to claim what is due in terms of the credit agreement. This is in line with international consumer legislation, but the Act's provisions have been criticised as being unusually cumbersome and detrimental to credit providers.&lt;ref&gt;Visagie 2006 De Rebus at page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Default notice to the consumer ====
If a consumer is in default, the credit provider must notify the consumer of his default in writing. This is effectively a letter of demand. The notice must do more, however: The credit provider must propose to the consumer that the consumer refer the credit agreement to, among others, a debt counsellor to resolve the dispute or agree on a plan to get payments up to date.

As regards the method of delivery of the written default notice, the consumer may choose to be informed in one or more of these ways:

* in person at the credit provider's business premises;
* at any other place chosen by the consumer, at the consumer's expense; or
* by ordinary mail fax or email or printable web-page.

Must the default notice actually reach the consumer to be effective? The Constitutional Court held in Sebola v Standard Bank&lt;ref&gt;2012 (5) SA 142 (CC).&lt;/ref&gt; that the Act, although it gives no clear meaning to “deliver,” requires that the credit provider, in seeking to enforce a credit agreement, must aver and prove that the notice was delivered to the consumer. Where the credit provider posts the notice, proof of registered despatch to the address of the consumer, together with proof that the notice reached the appropriate post office for delivery to the consumer, will constitute sufficient proof of delivery (in the absence of contrary indication).

==== Debt procedures in court ====
A credit provider may go to court to enforce a credit agreement only if

* the consumer has been in default for at least 20 business days;
* at least ten business days have elapsed since the credit provider delivered the default notice;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* the consumer has not responded to the notice or responded by rejecting the proposals in the notice;
* the consumer has not surrendered to the credit provider the goods subject to the credit agreement him/herself (in the case of an instalment agreement, secured loan or lease agreement).&lt;ref&gt;See below.&lt;/ref&gt;

The twenty days and ten days referred to above may run concurrently: that is, the ten-day period may occur during the 20-day period.

Where a case has been referred to the National Consumer Tribunal, debt counsellor, ombud, alternative-dispute-resolution agent or consumer court, or the credit agreement is subject to a debt review, the court will adjourn the case.

A much larger number of requests for default judgment on credit agreements now have to be referred to a magistrate,&lt;ref&gt;s 2(5) of the Magistrates’ Courts Act.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than being dealt with by the clerk of the court. This will greatly increase the workload of the magistrates, and could cause debt enforcement procedures to take much longer, resulting in frustration for credit providers.

==== Attachment and sale of goods ====
If a credit provider properly cancels a credit agreement, the court may order the attachment of the goods, allowing for the sale of the goods to settle the account. This procedure follows the usual common law.

If the proceeds of the sale are not sufficient to settle the account, the credit provider may approach the court for an order to recover the outstanding balance. This applies in the case of the instalment agreement, secured loan or lease. Strangely absent from this list is the mortgage agreement. This implies that the mortgagee (a bank, usually) will be able to rely only on the proceeds of the sale of the property to settle the account—even if this is insufficient, and even if the mortgagor (the debtor) is very wealthy and has other assets that could be attached.

==== Interim attachment orders ====
Common practice is that a credit provider asks the court for an “interim attachment order,” pending cancellation of the agreement, in order to protect goods at risk (like a motor car) from deterioration or damage. This order will allow the sheriff to attach the goods for safekeeping until such time as the court action is finalised, which can take a long time. It is not clear from the Act whether or not credit providers will still be able to obtain interim attachment orders. The past practice of obtaining such orders may well continue.

==== Re-instatement of credit agreement by consumer ====
At any time before cancellation, a consumer may reinstate a credit agreement that is in default by paying all amounts overdue, plus default charges and the costs of enforcing the debt to date. The consumer may then repossess property attached, but not if the goods have already been sold.

==== Surrender of goods ====
The consumer may choose at any time to surrender the goods that are subject to the credit agreement, whether or not the consumer is in default. This provision is discussed in detail above.

==== Unlawful collection practices ====
A credit provider may not use an identity document, credit or debit card, access card or PIN to enforce a credit agreement or collect on the agreement. A contravention of this provision is a criminal offence.

'''Downtown Brooklyn''' is the third largest [[central business district]] in [[New York City]], [[United States]] (following [[Midtown Manhattan]] and [[Lower Manhattan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ny-offices.com/nycity/new-york-city%E2%80%99s-cbds/|title=New York City’s CBDs (Central Business Districts) –         The Office that Never Sleeps|work=ny-offices.com|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and is located in the northwestern section of the [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Brooklyn]]. The neighborhood is known for its office and residential buildings, such as the [[Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower]] and the [[MetroTech Center]] office complex. 

Since the rezoning of Downtown Brooklyn in 2004, the area has been undergoing a transformation, with $9 billion of private investment and $300 million in public improvements underway. The area is a growing hub for education. In 2017, [[New York University]] announced that it would invest over $500 million to renovate and expand the [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering|NYU Tandon School of Engineering]] and its surrounding Downtown Brooklyn-based campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://engineering.nyu.edu/in-media/2017/02/02/nyu-invests-500-million-renovations-brooklyn-campus|title=NYU Invests $500 Million in Renovations for Brooklyn Campus|work=NYU Tandon School of Engineering|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early development===
[[File:Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower by DS.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower]], a prominent symbol of Downtown Brooklyn]]

This area was originally inhabited by [[Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], until the 17th century. Area close to the [[Wallabout Bay]] was called Rinnegokonk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Canarsee Indians: The Original Inhabitants|last = Jaffe|first = Herman J.|publisher = The Fourth Largest City In America, Brooklyn College Press|year = 1979|isbn = |location = Brooklyn|pages = 46–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the Dutch arrived, gained control of the land, and called it Breuckelen. The waterfront area being sold by Indians to [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], who used the land for farm purposes. Until 1814, Downtown Brooklyn and [[Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Heights]] remained sparsely populated.  [[Robert Fulton]]’s new steam ferry then began to offer an easy [[commuting]] option to and from downtown Manhattan. It made Brooklyn Heights Manhattan’s first [[suburb]], and put Downtown Brooklyn on its way to becoming a commercial center, and the heart of the [[History of Brooklyn|City of Brooklyn]].

The city was home to many prominent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]s at a time when most of New York was indifferent to slavery. Many Brooklyn churches agitated against legalized slavery in the 1850s and 1860s and some acted as safehouses as part of the [[Underground Railroad]] movement. [[Walt Whitman]] was fired from his job as a reporter at the Brooklyn Eagle due to his support for the [[Wilmot Proviso]] when he lived at Willoughby and [[Myrtle Avenue]]s. A group of buildings at 223, 225, 227, 231, 233, and 235 Duffield Street, in addition to the African Wesleyan Methodist Episcopal Church located in MetroTech Center, were believed to be among the safehouses.&lt;ref name=fny/&gt;

The middle 19th century growth of the Port of New York caused shipping to spill over into the City of Brooklyn; many buildings now used for other purposes were built as warehouses and factories.  Manufacturing intensified with the building of the [[Brooklyn Bridge|Brooklyn]] and [[Manhattan Bridge]]s; buildings from that time include the 1915 [[Sperry Gyroscope Company]] building, now known as the Howard Building of [[CUNY]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syndicate Takes Title to Hoffman and Albemarle Hotels for $1,700,000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1915/06/13/archives/latest-dealings-in-the-realty-field-syndicate-takes-title-to.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 13, 1915 |page=XX8 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; New, extensive infrastructure served the [[Brooklyn Bridge trolleys]].

===20th century===
[[File:AdamsStreetRU.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Adams Street/Brooklyn Bridge Boulevard, a major corridor through Downtown Brooklyn]]
[[File:Downtown Brooklyn streetscape April 2016 5.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Tillary Street, another major corridor]]
Following [[World War II]], the [[New York City Department of City Planning|City Planning Commission]], in conjunction with the Borough President’s Office, presented and adopted a Master Plan for the Civic Center, which included an ambitious public improvements program. The program included plans for new buildings for City and State agencies, significant street widening and major housing construction in adjacent areas. A study conducted eight years later highlighted the progress made, emphasizing the widening of Adams Street (and later Boerum Place), which created a long and sweeping approach to Downtown Brooklyn from a modernized Brooklyn Bridge.

By the late 1960s, the patterns of transition that affected much of urban America initiated concern to protect the borough’s Central Business District from deterioration. In 1969, a comprehensive plan for the entire city was completed and in the report the City Planning Commission stated, “[Downtown Brooklyn’s] economy is vital to the borough and important to the entire metropolitan region.”{{citation needed |date=July 2018}} In re-affirming Downtown Brooklyn’s central role and identifying its problems, the Plan was optimistic that a combination of public and private efforts would stimulate office and commercial construction. A 23-story privately financed office tower at Boerum Place and Livingston Street opened in 1971 and the anticipated growth of the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] (BAM) succeeded far beyond expectations, giving this cultural institution an important role as a symbolic anchor amid increasing decay during the following decade.

After suffering with the rest of New York through the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970s, Borough President [[Howard Golden]], first elected in 1977, moved forward with a more aggressive economic development program to revitalize Downtown Brooklyn. He identified the need for greater equity in resource allocation between Manhattan and the city’s other boroughs. An important moment in the history of Downtown Brooklyn came in 1983 with the release of a Regional Plan Association report for the area. According to the document, Downtown Brooklyn could become the city’s third-largest business district because of its proximity to Lower Manhattan (closer by subway than Midtown). It also could serve as a prime location for high technology industries and new market-rate housing.  The [[State Street Houses]] Historic District was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rezoning===
Historically, Downtown Brooklyn was primarily a commercial and civic center, with relatively little residential development. Housing included a few apartment buildings on Livingston Street, and seven 15-story buildings that make up the over 1,000 unit Concord Village co-op development on Adams Street, at the borders of both [[Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Heights]] and [[Dumbo, Brooklyn|Dumbo]].[[File:LawrenceStreet.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lawrence Street in Downtown Brooklyn]] Since the rezoning of parts of Downtown Brooklyn in 2004 to allow for denser residential development, the area has seen the arrival of new condominium towers, townhouses, and office conversions. In all, 14,000 residential units were planned for Downtown Brooklyn at that time.{{citation needed |date=July 2018}} A New York Sun article from November 7, 2007, reports on the arrival of Downtown Brooklyn as a 24/7 community, estimating that 35,000 residents will come to the area in the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stoler|first=Michael|title=Downtown Brooklyn Finally Arrives|newspaper=The New York Sun|date=November 8, 2007|url=http://www.nysun.com/real-estate/downtown-brooklyn-finally-arrives/66134/|accessdate=August 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, residents started moving into the new residential buildings, according to a New York Sun article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hope|first=Bradley|title=First Residents Arrive for Downtown Brooklyn 'Renaissance'|newspaper=The New York Sun|date=January 24, 2008|url= http://www.nysun.com/real-estate/first-residents-arrive-for-downtown-brooklyn/70102/|accessdate=August 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[New York City Department of City Planning]] approved another, significant rezoning for portions of Downtown Brooklyn, including the [[Fulton Mall]] area, which resulted in significant expansion of office space and ground-floor retail, such as those at [[City Point (Brooklyn)|City Point]].&lt;ref name="fny"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2012/03/downtown-brooklyn/ |title=Downtown Brooklyn |work=[[Forgotten New York]] |author=Kevin Walsh |accessdate=August 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rezoning consists of "zoning map and zoning text changes, new public open spaces, pedestrian and transit improvements, urban renewal, [and] street mappings".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/dwnbklyn2/dwnbklynintro1.shtml Downtown Brooklyn], [[New York City Department of City Planning]]. Accessed October 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The City Planning initiative also seeks to improve the connections between Downtown and the adjacent neighborhoods of [[Cobble Hill, Brooklyn|Cobble Hill]], [[Boerum Hill]], and [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn|Fort Greene]].

{{As of|2012|03}}, the rezoning of Downtown Brooklyn had caused gentrification in nearby neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="fny" /&gt; Affordable housing was created in the area after the 2004 rezoning, with 420 affordable units in 2014. The housing increase has also resulted in positive effects on other aspects of Downtown Brooklyn's economy as well, with revenues for the area's hospitality industry having tripled since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Anuta | first=Joe | title=Downtown B'klyn seen as 'shining example' | website=Crain's New York Business | date=July 15, 2014  | url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140715/REAL_ESTATE/140719927/downtown-bklyn-seen-as-shining-example | accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of this gentrification was controversial, however. In 2007, the city government was to acquire the houses at 223–235 Duffield Street via [[eminent domain]], then demolish the houses and replace them with 500 new hotel rooms, 1,000 units of [[mixed-income housing]], more than 500,000 square feet of retail space, and at least 125,000 square feet of new office space in the area; however, only 231 Duffield Street was replaced by a hotel.&lt;ref name="fny" /&gt; Still, this caused historians to protest over the planned demolition of the historic houses because of their importance to abolitionists during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Probasco | first=Mat | title=Historians in push to ‘save’ Duffield Street | website=The Brooklyn Paper | date=June 23, 2007  | url=http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/30/25/30_25duffield.html | accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown Brooklyn is the civic and commercial [[downtown]] center of the former [[History of Brooklyn|City of Brooklyn]], which, as of 2010, has 2.6 million residents. The area includes [[Brooklyn Borough Hall]], the [[Kings County, New York|Kings County]] New York State courthouse, and the [[Theodore Roosevelt Federal Courthouse|Theodore Roosevelt Courthouse]] for the federal [[Eastern District of New York]]. Schools include [[Brooklyn Friends School]], [[St. Francis College]], [[Saint Joseph's College, New York|St. Joseph's College]], [[Brooklyn Law School]], [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering|NYU Tandon School of Engineering]], [[Center for Urban Science and Progress]], [[New York City College of Technology]], and [[Long Island University]]. Attractions within the area include the [[Fulton Mall]], [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]], [[New York Transit Museum]] and [[Barclays Center]].

Three days a week the Borough Hall [[Greenmarket]], featuring fresh produce from local farmers, operates on the plaza fronting Borough Hall. Formerly called Supreme Court Plaza, the location was renamed as Columbus Park in 1986.

===Points of interest===
[[MetroTech Center]], a business and educational center, lies between [[Flatbush Avenue]] and Jay Street, above the [[Jay Street – MetroTech (New York City Subway)|Jay Street – MetroTech]] subway station, north of the [[Fulton Street Mall]], and south of the busy Tillary Street.

[[Cadman Plaza]] Park, named for a [[S. Parkes Cadman|prominent evangelist]], provides {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of green space in the neighborhood, and was recently renovated by the New York City Parks Department. These and other parks form a long mall from Borough Hall to Brooklyn Bridge.

==Transportation==
[[File:Jay Street – MetroTech station entrance via AVA DoBro Building.jpg|thumb|right|Jay Street–MetroTech station entrance in the AVA DoBro Building]]

Downtown Brooklyn is connected with [[Manhattan]] by the [[Brooklyn Bridge|Brooklyn]] and [[Manhattan Bridge|Manhattan]] Bridges.

The neighborhood has extensive public transportation accessibility; it is served by the [[New York City Subway]] and many bus lines. All but one [[New York City Subway nomenclature#Current status|Manhattan trunk line]] in [[Lower Manhattan]] has a direct connection to Downtown Brooklyn. From south to north, the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Lexington Brooklyn}}) via the [[Joralemon Street Tunnel]], the [[BMT Broadway Line|BMT Broadway]] and [[BMT Nassau Street Line]]s ({{NYCS trains|Montague}}) via the [[Montague Street Tunnel]], the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh Brooklyn}}) via the [[Clark Street Tunnel]] and the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Cranberry}}) via the [[Cranberry Street Tunnel]]  provide that service. Slightly farther north, the [[Manhattan Bridge]] ({{NYCS trains|Manhattan Bridge}}) and [[Rutgers Street Tunnel]] ({{NYCS trains|Sixth Rutgers}}) also feed subway trains from the [[Lower East Side]] into Downtown Brooklyn.

Major stations in the neighborhood are:

* [[Jay Street–MetroTech (New York City Subway)|Jay Street–MetroTech]] ({{NYCS trains|MetroTech}})
* [[Court Street–Borough Hall (New York City Subway)|Court Street–Borough Hall]] ({{NYCS trains|Court-Borough}})

'''Downtown Stamford''' is the [[central business district]] of the city of [[Stamford, Connecticut]], United States. Also known as "Stamford Downtown." It is an economically thriving area of the city, with major retail establishments, a [[shopping mall]], a [[University of Connecticut|university]] campus, the headquarters of major corporations and fortune 500 companies, as well as other retail businesses, hotels, restaurants, offices, entertainment venues, and high-rise apartment buildings. In recent years, more housing has been constructed in the neighborhood and more is planned.

With transportation widely seen as one of the biggest challenges facing the [[Economy of Stamford, Connecticut|Economy of Stamford]], Downtown has become an important transportation hub, as well as a business hub for lower [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]]. For example, it is an area within walking distance of the [[Metro-North]] train station, which is one of the busiest on the New Haven Railroad Line.

The Downtown area has been the heart of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Connecticut]] since colonial times. Much of the [[History of Stamford, Connecticut|history of Stamford]] took place there. Most of the southern and central portions of Downtown have been designated as historic districts, listed as the [[Downtown Stamford Historic District]] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

In recent years, new development has consumed much of the Downtown area, with the additions of new high-rise buildings and office towers such as the new 34-story [[Trump Parc Stamford]], parks such as the new Mill River Park development project, and housing such as the new 17-story Highgrove Condominium Residences. Other development projects include new student housing at the [[University of Connecticut|UCONN]] Stamford branch, residential housing, and the massive planned [[Ritz-Carlton]] Stamford development, which will include two 39-story hotel/condominium towers. The project is currently on hold due to the economic downturn in 2008. The city also plans to make improvements to the Atlantic Street underpass beneath the [[New Haven Line]] railroad tracks just east of the [[Stamford (Metro-North station)|Stamford Transportation Center]] in order to alleviate a traffic bottleneck.&lt;ref name=mill/&gt; The improvements are also meant to allow quicker evacuation of areas of the [[South End of Stamford|South End]] if disaster strikes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The project received a $245,000 earmark in the federal budget passed in December 2007.&lt;ref name=mill/&gt;

==Location==
In relation to other neighborhoods in Stamford, the Downtown is east of the West Side (separated by the Mill River), north of the [[South End of Stamford|South End]] (separated by Interstate 95 and the Metro-North Railroad tracks) and [[Shippan, Connecticut|Shippan]] (also separated by the highway and railroad), west of the [[East Side of Stamford, Connecticut|East Side]] and [[Glenbrook, Connecticut|Glenbrook]], and south of Newfield, Belltown, High Ridge and Turn of River. Bull's Head, the mostly commercial area at the intersection of High Ridge Road and Long Ridge Road, is immediately north of the Downtown.

==Historic district==
[[File:Stamford CT Old Town Hall.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Old Town Hall (Stamford, Connecticut)|Stamford Old Town Hall]]]]
The '''Downtown Stamford Historic District''' is a [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] that was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983.  The originally listed area included 56 buildings along Atlantic, Main, Bank, and Bedford Streets, and examples of [[Late 19th and 20th Century Revivals architecture|Late 19th and 20th Century Revivals]], [[Late Victorian architecture|Late Victorian]], and [[Commercial Vernacular]] architecture.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its boundaries were increased in 1985 to include an area bounded by Atlantic, Main, Bank, Bedford, Summer between Broad and Main Sts. and Summer Pl. The 1985 boundary increase captured the only surviving area in downtown of lower-rent commercial structures such as warehouses, laundries, and stables.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3b"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=85000311}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Downtown Stamford Historic District (Boundary Increase) |date=December 1983 |author=Nils Kerschus and John Herzan |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NRHP url|id=85000311|title=''Accompanying six photos, from 1984''|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its boundaries were further increased in 2002 to include an area including Late 19th And 20th Century Revivals and [[Modern Movement]] architecture, roughly, Bedford Street between Broad and Forest Streets.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt; The 2002 increase added the 1939-built Avon Theatre and other buildings, adding Late Gothic Revival and Art Deco architectural styles not included in the first and second areas.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3c"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=02001744}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Downtown Stamford Historic District (Boundary Increase) |date=July 1, 2002 |author=Ellen Meager and Nils Kerschus |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NRHP url|id=02001744|title=''Accompanying 29 photos, from 2002 (see photo captions and maps page 21-23 of text document)''|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current boundaries of the historic district now encompass most of the southern half of Downtown.

==Distinctive architecture==
[[File:One Landmark Square Stamford Night.jpg|alt=|thumb|300x300px|[[One Landmark Square]], the second tallest building in Stamford, at 22 stories.]]

===High rises===
Recently, Downtown Stamford has experienced a boom in high-rise building construction.
*'''[[Trump Parc Stamford]]''' -- Finished in 2009, the 34-story condominium tower is currently the tallest building, office and residential, in Stamford and the second tallest building in the state, after the 38-story [[City Place I]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. The building currently features 170 condominium units and a 6-story parking podium. This tower will soon be surpassed by another tower owned by [[Marriott Hotels &amp; Resorts|Marriott Residence Inn]] that is currently under construction located at Atlantic Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stamford-downtown.com/business-resources/current-developments/|title=Current Developments|last=|first=|date=|website=Stamford Downtown|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[One Landmark Square]]''' -- Completed in 1973 at a cost of $35&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/realestate/a-landmark-becomes-less-of-a-fortress.html?pagewanted=print] Charles, Eleanor, "In the Region/Connecticut: A Landmark Becomes Less of a Fortress," May 1, 2005, ''The New York Times'' Real Estate section, accessed August 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the skyscraper became the tallest building between [[New York City]] and [[Boston]] between 1973 and 2008. The "Landmark" in its name is no exaggeration. When it was built, the 22-story office building towered over a much lower skyline, and it remains the second-tallest building in the city, and the tallest office high-rise, as well as one of the most distinctive buildings in Downtown Stamford. Five smaller buildings designed by Moshe Safdie, such as the Biltmore Apartments, were later built around the tower.&lt;ref name=Dunlap/&gt;
*'''Highgrove Condominium Residences''' -- Finished in 2009, the 17-story condominium tower is currently the third-tallest building in Stamford and the second-tallest residential high-rise.

===Victor Bisharat's buildings===
[[File:One Stamford Forum.jpg|thumb|One Stamford Forum in 2010.|alt=|250x250px]]
Many of the most distinctive buildings in Downtown Stamford were designed by the late Victor Bisharat, a Jordanian who received his education at the American University in Beirut, Lebanon and at the University of California at Berkeley. His Stamford buildings were designed for F.D. Rich Co.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=129193, Emporis web site], accessed July 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (For information on Bisharat's buildings on High Ridge Road, see [[Arts and culture in Stamford, Connecticut]].)
*'''St. John's Towers''' -- The three cylindrical, 17-story towers were finished in 1971.
*'''[[One Landmark Square]]''' -- 22-story building completed in 1973 was the tallest building between [[New York City|New York]] and [[Boston]] from 1973-2008.
*'''One Stamford Forum''' -- Looking like an upside-down [[ziggurat]] above its three-story parking garage, the building has an enclosed arboretum rising from the ninth floor to the penthouse roof, which is covered by 76 [[acrylic glass]] domes. The 13-floor structure is 196&amp;nbsp;feet high and was completed in 1973 as the world headquarters for [[GTE|GTE Corporation]]. In the 1990s, the Tresser Boulevard entrance to the building was changed (in a design by Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum) from a "formidably stark concrete wall of a parking garage" to "a more inviting entrance ... clad in blue-gray ceramic tiles, with a lobby, canopy, colonnade and small garden."&lt;ref name="Dunlap"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/05/realestate/stamford-reinvents-its-downtown-once-again.html?pagewanted=print] Dunlap, David W., "Stamford Reinvents Its Downtown Once Again" New York Times, January 5, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the building is the headquarters to [[Purdue Pharma]] and [[Aircastle|Aircastle Limited]].
*'''Stamford Marriott Hotel &amp; Spa''' -- The 16 floor, 305-room hotel was completed in 1976 and was the largest hotel in Connecticut at the time. The hotel was expanded to 505 rooms in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fdrich.com/past-projects/|title=Past Projects {{!}} F. D. Rich Company|website=fdrich.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other buildings===
*'''One Atlantic Street''' -- Art Deco interiors, with murals in the ground-floor bank, and Art Deco exterior details as well. The red-brick/white marble building at the corner of Broad and Atlantic streets was finished in 1931 and for a long time was the tallest in Stamford.
*'''University of Connecticut Campus''' -- The {{convert|225000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building with the vast, green glass facade at the corner of Washington and Broad streets was designed by [[Perkins Eastman]].&lt;ref name=Dunlap/&gt;
*'''[[Old Town Hall (Stamford, Connecticut)|Old Town Hall]]''' &amp;mdash; The Beaux Arts building was built from 1905 to 1907 and served as the seat of local government until the early 1960s. The building opened for business on March 20, 1907. The last mayor to work there was J. Walter Kennedy, who moved to the Municipal Office Building that was on Atlantic Street (now torn down) in about 1961. The Old Town Hall held offices for the city government until all city offices were moved to 888 Washington Blvd. in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Dalena, Doug, "100&amp;nbsp;years ago, Old town hall had something new to offer", article in ''The Advocate'' of Stamford, page 1, Stamford and Norwalk editions&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:First Presbyterian Church Interior.jpg|thumb|Stained glass interior of the Fish Church.|alt=|250x250px]]
*'''[[Fish Church|The "Fish Church,"]]''' or the [http://www.fishchurch.org/ First Presbyterian Church] of Stamford, was designed by [[Wallace K. Harrison]], the chief architect of the [[United Nations]] buildings in New York City, and opened in 1958. The fish shape is obvious to anyone who drives by, but the floor plan is also fish-shaped. The stained glass windows in the sanctuary contain more than 20,000 pieces of faceted glass. They depict the story of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. The {{convert|32|ft|m|adj=on}}-high cross is faced with wood from [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. "Brilliant blues, reds and yellows make up the walls -- and seem to fill the air. 'It really is like being inside a jewel,' says Reverend David R. Van Dyke, a co-pastor. 'When I bring people who haven't been here before, there's an audible gasp.'" (Life Magazine, April 14, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.life.com/Life/churches/]"America's Coolest Churches," Life magazine, April 14, 2005, accessed July 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1958, the $1.5&amp;nbsp;million church was dedicated with capacity crowds filling it for three services.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Erin, "From the Archives: The Week of March 9" weekly column in ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]]'' of Stamford, March 10, 2008, p A5&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Gurley Building''' (1924), also known as Valeur Building, an eight-story tall, narrow building at northwest corner of Main St. and Atlantic St. intersection (see {{NRHP url|id=83003502|title=photo #4|photos=y}}).

==Shopping==
By city ordinance, all large stores in Stamford must be located within the Downtown Special Services District, unless special waivers are given. The area includes the [[Stamford Town Center]], an indoor shopping mall in the heart of the Downtown.

==Entertainment==

Most of Stamford's larger entertainment venues are located in the Downtown. These include the Palace Theatre, Rich Forum, as well as various movie other theaters. The area around Columbus Park and Bedford Street has become a center for bars, clubs, and restaurants, although all three can be found elsewhere Downtown and around the city.

==Mill River Park==
[[File:Mill River Park Stamford.jpg|alt=|thumb|300x300px|Mill River Park in Stamford]]
Mill River Park, which separates Downtown from the West Side, is to be expanded in an $8.5&amp;nbsp;million project, including $4&amp;nbsp;million in federal funding earmarked in 2007, with the city government financing the rest of the cost. The federal funding is to pay for removing the Mill River dam and dredging. That part of the project is the first step in the long-planned renovation of the park.&lt;ref name=mill&gt;Porstner, Donna, "Stamford to get $7M from feds", ''The Advocate'' of Stamford, Connecticut, December 20, 2007, Stamford edition, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The project plans call for narrowing the width of the river to less than half of its current expanse, which would expand the park's area and provide space for more amenities. The master plan provides for a carousel, fountain, ice rink and network of trails connecting a greenway with the Kosciuszko, Southfield and Scalzi parks. Removing the dam will also allow fish to swim up from Long Island Sound. As of 2007, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had spent $800,000 on preliminary studies, planning and design.&lt;ref name=mill/&gt;

The cherry trees in Mill River Park were presented to the city on April 27, 1957 by Junzo Nojima, a native of Japan who had settled in the city in 1926 and in 1932 became the first Japanese man to own a restaurant in the state (K&amp;J Three Decker Restaurant on Atlantic Street). Nojima gave the city 120 trees, and for three years he watered each one until they took root. He gave the city instructions on how to care for them, but when they were overlooked, he began tending the trees himself. On Arbor Day, April 27, 2007, the city celebrated the 50th anniversary of the gift with a ceremony at the park.&lt;ref&gt;Deka, Christina, special correspondent, "On Arbor Day, city will honor deep roots: Event will mark 50&amp;nbsp;years of Mill River cherry trees", news article in ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)]] of Stamford, Connecticut, page A11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
[[File:Alive@Five Stamford Boyz II Men.jpg|alt=|thumb|Alive@Five in Columbus Park]]
The Downtown Special Services District, known as Stamford Downtown, hosts events from June through December including a tour of a world class sculpture exhibit, "Alive@Five" and "Jazz up July" outdoor concerts in Columbus Park, Arts &amp; Crafts on Bedford Street and a giant helium balloon parade that marches through downtown which bring thousands of people into the downtown.

==Police and fire services==
The main police station is located in the heart of Downtown, at 805 Bedford Street. A substation is located on Atlantic Street.

The [[Stamford Fire Rescue]] Department's Fire Station's # 1 and 5 serve the neighborhood. Fire Headquarters, or Fire Station # 1 is located on Main Street, in the heart of Downtown, while Fire Station # 5 is located on Washington Boulevard, in the Woodside neighborhood, just north of Downtown.

==Filming locations==
*Almost all of [[Elia Kazan|Elia Kazan's]] 1947 film, ''[[Boomerang (1947 film)|Boomerang]]'', was shot in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], and most of that in the downtown area. The Old Town Hall was used, particularly the old Police Department offices and the stairway leading up from them to the courtroom. For a scene in which a pastor was killed, the movie used the front and sidewalk of the Plaza Theatre, which stood on Greyrock Place (a driveway leading into the [[Stamford Town Center]] Mall is at that location now). The former offices of ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]]'' of Stamford, on Atlantic Street, were also used. "[I]t wasn't an oddity to run into [[Dana Andrews]], one of the stars of the movie, in a local restaurant, or to see other stars on the street," according to Don Russell, a columnist for ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]]''.&lt;ref name=dr&gt;Russell, Don, "'Roles' in movies are nothing new for city: Kazan used Stamford in the '40s", editorial page column in ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]]'', Stamford edition, page A10, April 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
*Part of [[Otto Preminger|Otto Preminger's]] 1963 film, ''[[The Cardinal (1963 film)|The Cardinal]]'', was shot in St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church on Atlantic Street. Some people stood for hours on the east side of Atlantic Street (across the street from the church) to get a glimpse of the stars.&lt;ref name=dr/&gt;

[[File:Cluster of downtown buildings as seen from the Forks, Winnipeg.JPG|thumb|275px|View of Downtown Winnipeg from [[The Forks, Winnipeg|The Forks]].]]
'''Downtown [[Winnipeg]]''' is an area of the city located near the confluence of the [[Red River of the North|Red]] and [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]] rivers. It is the oldest urban area in Winnipeg, and is home to the city's commercial core, city hall, the seat of Manitoba's provincial government, and a number of major attractions and institutions.

The City of Winnipeg's official downtown boundaries are: the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] mainline on the north, Gomez Street and the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] on the east, and the [[Assiniboine River]] on the south. The western boundaries are downtown are irregular, following along a number of different streets, back lanes, and across properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipeg.ca/interhom/CityHall/OurWinnipeg/map/map.asp |title=Map for OurWinnipeg Adopted by City Council |accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Generally speaking, the western boundaries are rarely further west of Balmoral and Isabel Streets. In 2016, ''[[Canadian Geographic]]'' produced a map that generalize Winnipeg's downtown boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canadiangeographic.ca/article/six-maps-put-canadas-downtown-cores-context |title=Six maps that put Canada's downtown cores in context |accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighbourhoods in the downtown area include the [[Exchange District]], [[Central Park (Winnipeg)|Central Park]], [[The Forks, Winnipeg|The Forks]], and [[Chinatown, Winnipeg|Chinatown]]. The downtown area is roughly three square kilometres. Winnipeg Square, [[Bell MTS Place]], [[Portage Place]], and the flagship store of [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|the Bay]] are all located on the downtown section of [[Portage Avenue]]. On Main Street are Winnipeg's City Hall, [[Union Station (Winnipeg)|Union Station]], and the [[Manitoba Centennial Centre]], which includes the [[Manitoba Museum]], the [[Planetarium]], the Centennial Concert Hall and the [[Winnipeg Railway Museum]]. Although over 60,000 people work downtown, only 13,470 people actually live in the Downtown area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residential Development Strategy |url=http://www.winnipeg.ca/ppd/planning/Planning_downtown/PDF/Residential%20Development%20Strategy.pdf?DocId=11218&amp;SectionId=298498&amp;InitUrl=/CLKDMIS/Documents/c/2011/m11218/ddhrm%2007%2004%20no.%2002.pdf |publisher=''The City of Winnipeg'' |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several residential projects under construction on Waterfront Drive and in the Exchange District, and the residential population of the area is projected to increase substantially in the next few years.

==Neighbourhoods==

The ''Downtown Winnipeg Zoning By-Law'' defines the boundaries of the Downtown planning area, and several sectors within it. The downtown census area is slightly smaller, omitting a three-block extension at the north edge. There is also a significantly larger Downtown community area, used for Community Social Data Strategy for Winnipeg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipeg.ca/census/2001/includes/Geographies.stm#CommunityAreas |title=(UD) : 2001 Census |publisher=Winnipeg.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipeg.ca/census/2006/Community%20Area/] 2006 Census data&lt;/ref&gt;

Myeni obtained her Primary Teachers Certificate from Madadeni College and her a Secondary Teachers Diploma from Umlazi College.  In 2009 the SAA annual report listed a bachelor's degree in administration from the University of Zululand among her qualifications. It was removed the following year after Myeni admitted she was “studying toward it” with two majors outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Qualified to teach -- but can she run SAA?|url = http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/2014/11/06/qualified-to-teach----but-can-she-run-saa|website = Times LIVE|accessdate = 2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is listed as one of the participants in South African mining company [[Gold Fields]]' [[Black Economic Empowerment|BEE partner]] Invictus Consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Invictus participants in BEE deal - Gold Fields|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/subscribe/here-are-the-names-of-invictus-participants-in-bee|publisher = politicsweb.co.za|date = 27 March 2013|accessdate = 31 December 2015|author = Gold Fields}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myeni was first appointed to South African Airway's board of directors in 2009.  She was appointed chairperson of the board in 2012 following the simultaneous resignation of eight of its fourteen board members including the company's then chairperson [[Cheryl Carolus]].&lt;ref name="bdLive"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/companies/2012/12/23/all-change-at-the-top-in-major-sectors | title=All change at the top in major sectors | publisher=[[Business Day (South Africa)|Business Day]] | date=23 December 2012 | accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012/13 she had then acting chief executive, Vuyisile Kona removed from his position at the airline amid accusations that she organised the airline's security service to spy on him.&lt;ref name="MGneneVictim"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://amabhungane.co.za/article/2015-12-11-saa-nene-joins-myenis-pile-of-victims | title=SAA: Nene joins Myeni's pile of victims | publisher=[[Mail and Guardian]] | date=11 December 2015 | accessdate=31 December 2015 | author=AmaBhungane Reporters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 six non-executive directors of the state-owned South African Airways wrote to the then minister for [[Department of Public Enterprises|Public Enterprises]], [[Malusi Gigaba]], of their “major dissatisfaction” with Myeni's leadership.&lt;ref name="MGneneVictim" /&gt;  In March 2014 the new chief executive, Monwabisi Kalawe, accused Myeni of corruption after paying for documents that allegedly showed Myeni had foreign bank accounts worth €18.5-million.  These documents were proven to be fake and lead to disciplinary proceedings against Kalawe.&lt;ref name="CashForDirt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mg.co.za/article/2015-03-12-saa-boss-in-cash-for-dirt-scandal | title=SAA boss in 'cash for dirt' scandal | publisher=[[Mail and Guardian]] | date=13 March 2015 | accessdate=31 December 2015 | author=AMABHUNGANE REPORTERS}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2014 Myeni accused Kalawe of serious governance breaches.  An accusation Kalawe disputed prompting Gigaba to state his “full confidence” in Kalawe following Gigaba's call for the state-owned airline to fix its long-troubled management problems.  Gigaba went on to state that he would "deal with" Myeni for her dispute with Kalawe.  Within a week of Gigaba's statement he was shuffled by president Zuma to the [[Department of Home Affairs (South Africa)|Department of Home Affairs]]. Gigaba was replaced by [[Lynne Brown]] as minister for Public Enterprises.  Upon Zuma's request Brown replaced Myeni's critics at the airline and keeping Myeni in her position whilst instructing Myeni to reinstate Kalawe as chief executive. An instruction that Myeni ignored.&lt;ref name="MGneneVictim" /&gt;

In March 2015 South African Airways signed an agreement with [[Airbus]] as part of the airline's turn around plan to lease 5 [[Airbus A330]]s.  In October 2015, without involving South African Airways executives, Myeni informed Airbus that the airway would be renegotiating the agreement to instead be an outright sale to an unnamed third party that would purchase the planes on SAA’s behalf.  This raised concerns around corruption by-passing normal procurement process and triggered a clause in the original agreement that any renegotiation of the agreement would need to be approved by the [[Department of Finance (South Africa)|Ministry of Finance]].&lt;ref name="SAAtestsNene"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/business/transport/2015/11/12/saa-tests-nene | title=SAA tests Nene | publisher=[[Business Day (South Africa)|Business Day]] | date=12 November 2015 | accessdate=31 December 2015 | author=CAROL PATON}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an editorial Myeni stated that the reason why a third party rental company was needed was so as to mitigate the impact of volatile exchange rates on the running costs of the aircraft thereby reducing the airline's foreign currency exposure.&lt;ref name="MyeniConjecture"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/2015/11/18/mere-conjecture-cannot-fly-for-airline-expansion-strategy | title=Mere conjecture cannot fly for airline expansion strategy | publisher=[[Business Day (South Africa)|Business Day]] | date=18 November 2015 | accessdate=5 January 2016 | author=Myeni, Dudu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecoprenuership''', also known as '''Green Entrepreneurship''', not to be mistaken for “[[Sustainable Business]]” or “[[Green Business]]” is most simply referred to as the development of enterprise through entrepreneurship while incorporating an environmentally responsible perspective into the operations and goals of the entrepreneur. Ecopreneurship is also a term coined to represent the process of principles of entrepreneurship being applied to create businesses that solve environmental problems or operate sustainably.

==History and Development of Ecoprenuership==
Literature began being published on Ecoprenuership in the early 1990s with the introduction of ''Merging Economic and Environmental Concerns Through Ecoprenuership'' by Gwynn Schuyler (Schuyler. 1998). Schuyler offers a simple yet unprecedented definition of Ecoprenuership."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Merging Economic and Environmental Concerns Through Ecopreneurship|last=Schuyler|first=Gwen|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Schuyler's definition in 1998 the definition of Ecopreuership has developed and concepts defining the term have changed. David Kainrath of the Umea School of Business has defined Ecoprenuership as the convergence of three main concepts, including:
# Eco-innovation
# Eco-opportunity
# Eco- commitment
Furthermore, Kainrath states that an Ecoprenuerial Company is "a company in which the three Ecoprenuership Concepts manifest."

== Systems thinking ==
Systems Thinking is a core principle to any business concerned with sustainability and the environment. It is an approach to problem solving that studies how something interacts with its environment as a whole, whether that be social, economic or natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thinking.net/Systems_Thinking/Intro_to_ST/intro_to_st.html|title=Intro to Systems Thinking|last=Aronson|first=Dan|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to a linear thinking model, which would isolate a problem and study only its directly related processes to find solutions. It consists of the notion that in order to understand vertical problems (looking deeply at one particular issue), you must understand and evaluate the horizontal environment as a whole (the entire system and its interrelated functions). As it pertains to business is best illustrated in the book ''Entrepreneurship and Sustainability'' by Andrea Larsen,&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Systems thinking applied to new ventures reminds us that companies operate in complex sets of interlocking living and non-living, including markets and supply chains as well as non-living systems.... Taking a systems perspective reminds us that we are accustomed to thinking of business in terms of discrete units with clear boundaries between them. We forget that these boundaries exist primarily in our minds or as legal constructs."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Strategy and the Environment|last=Larson|first=Andrea|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=304–317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Product Design==
[[Product design]] incorporating sustainability can happen at any stage of the business, including material extraction, [[logistics]], the manufacturing process, disposal, etc. Sustainable product design can be achieved using innovative technology (or Eco-innovation), cradle to cradle design, [[Biomimetics|bio-mimicry]], etc. In a description by the government of Canada's department on Innovation, Science and Economic Development, sustainable product design is further explained:

"Product design offers the opportunity to incorporate green and socially responsible attributes into a product. Referred to as Design for Sustainability (D4S), it is a process that addresses environmental and social considerations in the earliest stages of the product development process to minimize negative environmental and social impacts throughout the product's life cycle and to comply with the principles of economic, social and ecological sustainability.

Sustainable product design can encompass the selection of materials, use of resources, production requirements and planning for the final disposition (recycling, reuse, remanufacturing, or disposal) of a product. It takes into account the socio-economic circumstances of the company and the opportunity for the firm to address social problems associated with poverty, safety, inequity, health and the working environment. It is not a stand-alone methodology but one that must be integrated with a company's existing product design so that environmental and social parameters can be integrated with traditional product attributes such as quality, cost, and functionality."

==Innovative Technology==
Companies practicing ecopreneurship aim to solve environmental issues by developing new technology or innovating existing technologies. Within the past five years modern society has witnessed development of precedent setting technologies such as long range electric vehicles as well as the improvement though innovation of existing technologies such as solar panels. Examples of innovation backed by an environmentally responsible attitude has inspired a new class of entrepreneurs who identify as Ecoprenuers.

The development of innovative technologies has developed an opportunity for Ecoprenuers to apply technology to sustainable or green businesses. Cosmin Nacu and Silvia Avasilcai state that "this trend has created a full range of opportunities for entrepreneurs: from creating green-technology, using technology to promote environmental sustainability (e.g. energy management) to simply make the existing business more environmentally friendly to take advantage of the benefits" (Source). The development of new and innovative technologies are complimentary to the development of green enterprises and enable Ecoprenuers to continue developing enterprise that are environmentally sustainable.

==Cradle to cradle Design==
[[Cradle-to-cradle design]] is a popular environmental approach to product design that seeks to eliminate waste by designing products that can be continuously recirculated through our economy. This is contrasted against a "cradle to grave" design which typically includes single use products or products made of multiple different materials that cannot be separated in order to be recycled properly.[5] Cradle to Cradle design is mimicked after processes in the natural environment which do not create waste but instead every output is an input for another organism. Cradle to Cradle design is often achieved through using environmentally friendly resources (non-toxic) that can either be recycled into other products or composted. Another important component of cradle to cradle design is the ability to easily take products apart for better reuse as well as designing with durability in mind. This idea was popularized by the 2002 book ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]'' written by William McDonough and Michael Braungart.

==Challenges and Opportunities==
The Sustainable Business Industry is one of the biggest opportunities in commerce in the past 20 years according to Thierry Volery, author of Ecopreneurship: Rationale, current issues and futures challenges &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Volery|first1=Thiery|title=Ecopreneurship: Rationale, current issues and futures challenges|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/T_Volery/publication/36387113_Ecopreneurship_rationale_current_issues_and_futures_challenges/links/54b3e67a0cf2318f0f9697fb.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, there continues to be a trend of challenges that Ecoprenuers face when developing their enterprise. "Ecology and economy have often been seen as conflicting, because the prevailing view is that there is an inherent and fixed trade-off between the two" and Ecoprenuers are constantly subjected to higher prices of operation that are inherit to operating in an environmentally sustainable way Rationale, current issues and futures challenges|url. The fact that Ecoprenuers aim to sustain "public goods" such as air, oceans, topsoil and wild species develops a challenge of measuring the use and value of these goods. Volery, author of '''Ecopreneurship: Rationale, current issues and futures challenges''' states  "it will never be profitable to  produce public goods privately, because the producer who incurs the cost of production cannot prevent the consumer from using the good freely" because public goods are non-excludable in consumption meaning that citizens cannot stop consuming certain public goods such as water or air.

Opportunities to develop sustainable business through Ecoprenuership represent a huge opportunity to take advantage of business practices of the future. Companies leading the way in sustainable business practices are taking advantage of sustainable revenue opportunities: according to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills the UK green economy to grow by 4.9 to 5.5 percent a year by 2015.[44] Since environmental concerns have become pressing many profitable opportunities have arisen. Government backed grants often lay the foundation for Ecoprenuers to take advantage of a quickly growing industry while being able to kickstart their endeavors with government money.

== Triple bottom line accounting ==
[[Triple bottom line]] Accounting is an accounting method that combines traditional [[accounting]] methods of measuring profit with those that measure social and environmental benefits as well. The phrase was created by John Elkington in 1994 at his company [http://www.sustainability.com/company SustainAbility]. Some criticisms have sprung up over what methods are to be used to measure environmental and social impacts.

== Legal forms ==
Ecopreneurs may decide to develop their company under traditional business legal forms like a [[sole proprietorship]] or an [[Limited liability company|LLC]] or they might chose some newer forms discussed below. These business forms are popular among the environmentally conscious community for their emphasis on social benefit.
* [[Low-profit limited liability company]] or (L3C) is a company that follows the same legal and tax codes as a traditional LLC but has a main goal of increasing social welfare like that of a non-profit organization.  This form of business is not available in every state of the USA as of 2013.
* [[Benefit corporation]] is for-profit legal entity that differs in its purpose and accountability from that of a regular corporation. Its emphasis on mission-driven purpose allows it a different accountability to stakeholders. This form of business is not available in every state of the USA as of 2013. More information can be found on the official website benefitcorp.net [http://benefitcorp.net/]

When creating a [[contract]], a negotiator is not only doing so to reach an agreement between two or more parties, but to create an agreement that is durable; whereby parties of the contract are legally bound and committed to its promises (Wade and Honeyman 2005, 7). A legally binding contract is defined as an exchange of promises or an agreement between parties that the law will enforce, and there is an underlying presumption for commercial agreements that parties ''intend'' to be legally bound (Contracts 2007).

In order to be a legally binding contract, most contracts must contain two elements:
 • All parties must agree about an offer made by one party and accepted by the other.
 • Something of value must be exchanged for something else of value. This can include goods, cash, services, or a pledge to exchange these items.
 
In addition, certain contracts are required by state law to be in writing (real estate transactions, for example), while others are not.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/contract-law-%E2%80%93-how-create-legally-binding-contract&lt;/ref&gt;

Wade and Honeyman (2007, 7) describe a ‘durable’ contract as one in which all parties substantially perform without abandonment and without resorting to legal proceedings. With only anecdotal evidence, it is difficult to know what percentages of contracts are in fact breached. It is probable that the statistics vary greatly over differing class, culture, wealth and type of transaction (Wade and Honeyman 2005, 7). The reasons for a [[breach of contract]] are also varying, and ethical issues can emerge in some situations.

Some ethical considerations which may become apparent in the durability of contracts are [[cultural relativism]] and [[moral relativism]].

Grace and Cohen (2005, 200) describe cultural relativism as the extent to which different societies and cultures have different values and ethical standards in the fields of business and organisational life. Those who embrace cultural relativism believe that all beliefs (religious, ethical, aesthetic, and political) are relative to the individual within a culture. Types of relativism include moral (where ethics depend on the social assembly), situational (where right or wrong is dependent on the situation), and cognitive (where truth itself has no objective standard). The legislative system is having a harder time defining laws with the diminishing set of standards, and our court system is having a harder time interpreting them (Cultural Relativism – Illogical Standard 2006).

Moral relativism views ethical standards, morality, and positions of right or wrong as being culturally based. This therefore subjects these views as being an individual’s choice. While modern society was previously governed by a "Judeo-Christian" standard, this view has increasingly been acknowledged as the chief moral philosophy of modern society (Moral Relativism – Neutral Thinking?. 2006). However, these "Judeo-Christian" standards continue to be the foundation for civil law, as most people believe that right and wrong are not absolutes, but are determined by the individual.

Following are reasons for breaches in contracts and the way in which these ethical considerations may impact upon them. In most of these situations, the law may not agree with moral or cultural relativism and award in favour of what people generally view as being ‘right’ or ‘wrong’. It is therefore imperative that contracts are created to be as durable as possible so parties are unable to find legal ‘loopholes’ and use their power, wealth, ignorance or cultural differences in setting contracts aside. Following these descriptions is a list of ways on which contracts can be made more durable.

==Cultural Expectations of Flexibility==

In some cultural groups such as Japan, the creation of a contract symbolises the formation of a working relationship, and not a legally binding agreement. Some groups will regard the contract as being flexible in terms that if any problems or issues arise, the parties will reassess the obligations of the agreement and negotiate ways to preserve the relationship (Honeyman and Wade 2007, 8). However, this is not generally the ‘Western’ view on contracts.

In relation to the ethical issue of cultural relativism, a business is obliged to operate in a manner acceptable to the host country, both legally and morally (Grace and Cohen 2005, 19). But what if the contract is not necessarily subject to having a ‘host country’? Is it morally wrong for a Western party to hold a Japanese party to the contract when it is known that the Japanese party would not have intended to be legally bound? Or is it unethical or immoral of the Japanese to sign such an agreement, even though they mean well when signing it, knowing the Western party intended to be legally bound by the contract but themselves see the contract as more of a flexible agreement?

Honeyman and Wade (2007) state that differences in cultural expectations can predictably lead to the more economically powerful party attempting to negotiate that all breaches will be dealt with ultimately by courts from their own culture, applying their own cultural and legal rules.

This then highlights the issue of different legal rules existing in different countries which enable contracts to be set aside. The list of exceptions to finality of contracts varies from one jurisdiction to another, and this is often placed under the label ‘frustration of contracts’.

==Lack of Informed Consent==

Some acts cannot legally take place because of a lack of [[informed consent]]. This can occur under conditions of pressures of limited time, money, exhaustion and exhortations to settle from lawyers. Another person is generally authorised to give consent if an individual is unable to. These cases sometimes result in a party refusing to comply with the terms of the contract; however, they are rarely successful as a defense to an enforcement action. Judges usually take the view that a client advised by a lawyer is strongly presumed both to have a basic understanding of legal principle, and to have given consent (Informed Consent 2007). This was the case in ''Gerbert and Gerbert'' (1990) FLC 92-137, where a husband settled for 10% of assets against his probable entitlement to 40%, and it was held that there was no miscarriage of justice as the husband acted freely and was advised to seek legal advice. In cases where an individual is provided limited facts, serious ethical issues may arise.

Is it ethical to hold someone to a contract when they clearly had no awareness of exactly what they were signing and committing themselves to, due to ignorance or not? Is it ethical for a lawyer to encourage the signing of a document if they are clearly not fully understanding of the document?

==Wealth==

If the chance of success and money is opportune to a wealthy person, their capacity and willingness can give rise to alleging various legal justifications for breach. A few years of legal expenses may only be a small proportion of their empire, and the resulting attrition and disparate investment in the conflict may eventually encourage other parties to renegotiate the disputed clauses (Honeyman and Wade 2005, 15).

In terms of moral relativism, most people would agree that it is ethically wrong to use wealth to control a situation and to ‘force’ people into renegotiating clauses in contracts if they are unable to afford the legal bill accompanying a dispute. However, as moral relativism is subject to a one’s own beliefs on what is right and wrong, some may not view using wealth as a means to control as being the wrong thing to do. In situations such as these, the ‘little man’ usually loses out and will ultimately succumb to the power of the other party or parties.

==Undue Influence==

[[Undue influence]] is an equitable doctrine that involves one person taking advantage of a position of power over another. The law presumes that in certain classes of relationship there will be a special risk of one party unduly influencing their conduct and motives for contracting (Undue Influence 2007). Because the court can vitiate such a contract if there is a special relationship, when no special relationship exists, the general rule is whether there was a relationship of such trust and confidence that it should give rise to such a presumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|41|1936|litigants=[[Johnson v Buttress]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/41.pdf (1936) 56 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 113] |courtname=auto |date=17 August 1936}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of such a case is ''Odorizzi v. Bloomfield School District'' CA Ct of App 54 Ca Rpt 533 [1964]. The plaintiff was under contract as a teacher.  He was arrested, and the next day he allegedly was pressured by his superiors to sign and deliver his resignation.  He was cleared of the criminal charges, and then he sought to be reinstated by the school district.  They refused, so he sued to rescind his resignation.  He claimed that his resignation should not be enforced because, among other things, he signed it under the "undue influence" of his superiors.

When a party has placed their confidence and trust in another and this relationship is broken, the view of moral relativism will generally see this situation as being wrong. Undue influence is usually an act of dishonesty and/or deceit in a situation where one party realizes their power over the other and takes advantage of this. Deception and deceit are not viewed as being ethical values inherent in a person.

==Increasing the Durability of Contracts==

As Honeyman and Wade (2005, 15) point out, to increase the chances of ‘performance’ of a contract (and therefore reduce chances of a breach), a party should enhance:

*Entering into contracts with parties where there is already a longstanding relationship – therefore raising incentives to perform promises
*Avoiding making contracts with cultural groups that view contracts as the ‘beginning of a relationship’, rather than a legally binding agreement
*Clarifying whether ‘yes’ means ‘maybe’ or ‘no’ and whether signed and detailed contracts are considered to be binding, morally, legally and/or in reputation, or just amount to the declaration that a working relationship now exists
*Including clauses and a discussion regarding how any future misunderstandings and problems will be addressed
*Attempting to agree that final determination of any future problems with performance will be in a court or arbitration venue
*Only going into contract with parties that are stable and reliable
*Taking out [[risk management]] insurance for non-performance or currency fluctuations
*Attempting to enter into an agreement which recognizes procedural, emotional and substantive needs of all parties involved
*Not walking close to the line on any of the legal rules such as [[duress]], [[deceit]], vague terminology or illegality and this will give other parties the opportunity to claim a loophole
*Attempting to reduce buyer’s remorse by
**Making congratulatory speeches about the agreement’s benefits
**Never agreeing quickly to any clauses
**Adding post-agreement gifts and bonuses
**Publicize the deal by mutual agreement. A wider audience will then place expectations on all parties to perform, or risk losing face and credibility in future arrangements. Most people have a strong desire to act consistently with their own clear commitment

'''Fawaz Abdullah Zureikat''' or '''Zuraiqat''' or '''Zurayqat''' and other variations (born 1955 – died 2010) was a Jordanian businessman.

Zureikat was implicated in the [[United Nations]] [[Oil for Food]] scandal relating to corruption surrounding [[Iraq]]'s oil exports. In the 2004 [[Duelfer Report]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lib.umich.edu/govdocs/pdf/duelfer1_eab.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Zureikat is identified as receiving oil allocations from Iraq via Middle East Semi Conductors Co. In other documents, another company – Aredio Petroleum – is also linked to Zureikat. He had been doing business in Iraq since 1986, and his brother Hatem has been a political prisoner in [[Syria]] since 1981 who once shared a cell with [[Tariq Aziz]].

For a time he was station manager of Arab Television (ATV), a short-lived English-language satellite channel with offices in London and Baghdad which filmed and distributed the worldwide rights to the pre-[[Iraq War]] interview conducted in Baghdad between [[Tony Benn]] and [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/my-fun-nights-out-with-georges-friend-6146182.html |title=My fun nights out with George's friend |author=Jonathan Elliott |date=15 May 2005 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a member of the [[National Mobilization Committee for the Defense of Iraq]] (NMCDI), based in Jordan, and a passionate opponent of sanctions on Iraq. He was arrested on 3 March 2003 in [[Amman]] by [[General Intelligence Directorate (Jordan)|The Jordanian intelligence services]], along with other prominent businessmen who had financial links with Saddam Hussein's regime. He was later released.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The '''Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003''' (FRBMA) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of India]] to institutionalize financial discipline, reduce India's fiscal deficit, improve macroeconomic management and the overall management of the public funds by moving towards a [[balanced budget]] and strengthen fiscal [[prudence]]. The main purpose was to eliminate revenue deficit&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;''Revenue Deficit'' is defined in the ''act'' as the difference between the revenue expenditure and revenue receipts which indicates increase in liabilities of the Central Government without corresponding increase in assets&lt;/ref&gt; of the country (building revenue surplus thereafter) and bring down the [[fiscal deficit]] to a manageable 3% of the GDP by March 2008. However, due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2007 international financial crisis]], the deadlines for the implementation of the targets in the act was initially postponed and subsequently suspended in 2009. In 2011, given the process of ongoing recovery, [[Economic Advisory Council]] publicly advised the [[Government of India]] to reconsider reinstating the provisions of the FRBMA. [[N. K. Singh]] is currently the Chairman of the review committee for Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003, under the [[Ministry of Finance (India)]], [[Government of India]].

==Enactment==
The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management ''Bill'' (FRBM Bill) was introduced in India by the then [[Finance Minister]] of India, Mr.[[Yashwant Sinha]]&lt;ref name="Bill"&gt;{{cite news

 | date = 21 December 2000
 | access-date =22 February 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2000. Firstly, the bill highlighted the terrible state of government finances in India both at the Union and the state levels under the statement of objects and reasons.&lt;ref name="IE1"&gt;{{cite news

 | date = 21 December 2000
 | access-date =22 February 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, it sought to introduce the fundamentals of fiscal discipline at the various levels of the government.The FRBM bill was introduced with the broad objectives of eliminating revenue deficit by 31 March 2006, prohibiting government borrowings from the [[Reserve Bank of India]] three years after enactment of the bill, and reducing the fiscal deficit to 2% of GDP (also by 31 March 2006).&lt;ref name="IE1"/&gt; Further, the bill proposed for the government to reduce liabilities to 50% of the estimated GDP by year 2011. There were mixed reviews among economists about the provisions of the bill, with some criticising it as ''too drastic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | date = 29 December 2000
 | access-date =22 February 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political debate ensued in the country. Several revisions later, it resulted in a much relaxed and watered-down version of the bill&lt;ref name="Rediff1"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including postponing the date for elimination of revenue deficit to 31 March 2008) with some experts, like Dr Saumitra Chaudhuri of ICRA Ltd.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Formerly Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency of India Limited&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icra.in/ ICRA Ltd]&lt;/ref&gt;(and now a member of [[Economic Advisory Council|Prime Ministers' Economic Advisory Council]]) commenting, "all teeth of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill have been pulled out and in the current form it will not be able to deliver the anticipated results."&lt;ref name="IE2"&gt;{{cite news

 | date = 27 July 2004
 | access-date =22 February 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would serve as the ''day of commencement of this Act''.

==Objectives==
The main objectives of the act were:&lt;ref name="CBGA"&gt;{{cite news
 | title = FRBM – A Review
 | url = http://www.cbgaindia.org/files/primers_manuals/FRBM%20-%20A%20Review.pdf
 | work = Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability
 | year = 2007
 | access-date =22 February 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# to introduce transparent fiscal management systems in the country
# to introduce a more equitable and manageable distribution of the country's debts over the years
# to aim for fiscal stability for India in the long run
Additionally, the act was expected to give necessary flexibility to [[Reserve Bank of India]](RBI) for managing inflation in India.&lt;ref name=TFE1/&gt;

==Content==
Since the act was primarily for the management of the governments' behaviour, it provided for certain documents to be tabled in the [[Parliament of India|parliament]] annually with regards to the country's fiscal policy.&lt;ref name="Act"/&gt; This included the following along with the [[Union budget of India|Annual Financial Statement and ''demands for grants'']]:
# a document titled ''Medium-term Fiscal Policy Statement'' – This report was to present a three-year rolling target for the ''fiscal indicators'' &lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The ''fiscal indicators'' was defined in this law as numerical ceilings and proportions to Gross Domestic Product, as may be prescribed for evaluation of the fiscal position of the Central Government.&lt;/ref&gt; with any assumptions, if applicable. This statement was to further include an assessment of sustainability with regards to ''revenue deficit'' and the use of capital receipts of the Government (including market borrowings) for generating productive assets.
# a document titled ''Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement'' – This was a tactical report enumerating strategies and policies for the upcoming [[Financial Year]] including strategic fiscal priorities, taxation policies, key fiscal measures and an evaluation of how the proposed policies of the Central Government conform to the 'Fiscal Management Principles' of this act.
# a document titled  ''Macro-economic Framework Statement'' – This report was to contain forecasts enumerating the growth prospects of the country. GDP growth, revenue balance, gross fiscal balance and external account balance of the balance of payments were some of the key indicators to be included in this report.
The Act further required the government to develop measures to promote ''fiscal transparency and reduce secrecy'' in the preparation of the Government financial documents including the Union Budget.

===Fiscal management principles===
The Central Government, by rules made by it, was to specify the following:&lt;ref name="Act"/&gt;
#a plan to eliminate revenue deficit by 31 March 2008 by setting annual targets for reduction starting from day of commencement of the act.
#reduction of annual fiscal deficit of the country
#annual targets for assuming contingent liabilities in the form of guarantees and the total liabilities as a percentage of the GDP

===Borrowings from Reserve Bank of India===
The Act provided that the Central Government shall not borrow from the [[Reserve Bank of India]](RBI) except under exceptional circumstances where there is temporary shortage of cash in particular financial year. It also laid down rules to prevent RBI from trading in the primary market for Government securities. It restricted them to the trading of Government securities in the secondary market after an April, 2005, barring situations highlighted in ''exceptions'' paragraph.

====Exceptions====
National security, natural calamity or other ''exceptional grounds that the Central Government may specify'' were cited as reasons for not implementing the targets for ''fiscal management principles, prohibition on borrowings from RBI and fiscal indicators'' highlighted above, provided they were approved by both the Houses of the Parliament as soon as possible, once these targets had been exceeded.&lt;ref name="Act"/&gt;

==Measures to enforce compliance==
This was a particularly weak area of the act. It required the Finance Minister of India to only conduct quarterly reviews of the receipts and expenditures of the Government and place these reports before the Parliament. Deviations to targets set by the Central government for fiscal policy had to be approved by the Parliament.&lt;ref name="Act"/&gt; No other measures for failure of compliance have been specified.

==Implementation==

===Targets and fiscal indicators===
Subsequent to the enactment of the FRBMA, the following targets and fiscal indicators were agreed by the central government:&lt;ref name="BL2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FRBMR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finmin.nic.in/law/frbmrules2004.pdf|title=Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Rules 2004|author=|date=|website=FinMin.nic.in|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Revenue deficit
** Date of elimination – 31 March 2009 (postponed from 31 March 2008)
** Minimum annual reduction – 0.5% of GDP
*Fiscal Deficit
** Ceiling – 3% of the GDP by 31 March 2008
** Minimum annual reduction – 0.3% of GDP
*Total Debt – 9% of the GDP (a target increased from the original 6% requirement in 2004–05)
** Annual reduction – 1% of GDP
*RBI purchase of government bonds – to cease from 1 April 2006
Four fiscal indicators to be projected in the medium term fiscal policy statement were proposed. These are, revenue deficit as a percentage of GDP, fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP, tax revenue as percentage of GDP and total outstanding liabilities as percentage of GDP.&lt;ref name="FRBMR"/&gt;

===Jurisdiction===
The residuary powers to make rules with respect to this act were with the Central Government&lt;ref name="Act"/&gt; with subsequent presentation before the Parliament for ratification. Civil courts of the country had no jurisdiction for enforcement of this act or decisions made therein. The power to remove difficulties was also entrusted to the Central Government.

==Criticism==
Some quarters, including the subsequent Finance Minister Mr. [[P. Chidambaram]], criticised the act and its rules as ''adverse'' since it might require the government to cut back on social expenditure necessary to create ''productive assets'' and general upliftment of rural poor of India.&lt;ref name="BL2"/&gt; The vagaries of [[monsoon]] in India, the social dependence on agriculture and over-optimistic projections of the task force in-charge of developing the ''targets'' were highlighted as some of the potential failure points of the Act. However, other viewpoints insisted that the act would benefit the country by maintaining stable inflation rates which in turn would promote social progress.&lt;ref name="TFE1"&gt;{{cite news
 | title = Fiscal Responsibility Bill to help maintain stable inflation rate

 |work=The Financial Express 
 | date = 24 December 2004
 | access-date =22 February 2011

Some others have drawn parallel to this act's international counterparts like the [[Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced Budget Act|Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act]] (US) and the [[Growth and Stability Pact]] (EU) to point out the futility of enacting laws whose relevance and implementation over time are bound to decrease.&lt;ref name="BL2"/&gt;  They described the law as ''wishful thinking'' and a ''triumph of hope over experience''. Parallels were drawn to the US experience of [[enactment of a bill|enacting]] ''debt-ceilings'' and how lawmakers have traditionally been able to amend such laws to their own political advantage.&lt;ref name = "Rediff1"/&gt; Similar fate was predicted for the Indian version which indeed was suspended in 2009 when the economy hit rough patches.&lt;ref name="LM"/&gt;

==Suspension and reinstatement==
Implementing the act, the government had managed to cut the fiscal deficit to 2.7% of GDP and revenue deficit to 1.1% of GDP in 2007–08.&lt;ref name=TET27022010&gt;{{cite news|title=Budget 2010: How FM tamed the deficit|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/union-budget/Budget-2010-How-FM-tamed-the-deficit/articleshow/5622365.cms|access-date=25 February 2011|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|international financial crisis of 2007]], the deadlines for the implementation of the targets in the act were suspended.&lt;ref name="LM"&gt;{{cite news

In August 2009, IMF had opined that India should implement fiscal reform at the soonest possible, enacting a successor to the current act.&lt;ref name=ZN/&gt; This IMF paper was authored by two senior IMF economists Alejandro Sergio Simone and Petia Topalova&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India's fiscal responsibility performance is mixed: IMF Paper|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2009/08/16/stories/2009081650870500.htm|access-date=25 February 2011|newspaper=Business Line|date=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlighted the shortcomings of the current law along with proposed improvements for a new version.

It was reported that the Thirteenth [[Finance Commission of India]] was working on a new plan for reinstating fiscal management in India.&lt;ref name=rediff2&gt;{{cite news|last=John Samuel Raja D|first=Sapna Singh|title=Spread fiscal deficit target over 5–6 yrs: Govt|url=http://business.rediff.com/report/2009/jun/01/bcrisis-spread-fiscal-deficit-target-over-5-6-yrs-govt.htm|access-date=25 February 2011|newspaper=Rediff.com|date=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial expectation for revival of ''fiscal prudence'' was in 2010–11&lt;ref name="LMa"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was further delayed. Finally, the government did announce a path of fiscal consolidation starting from fiscal deficit of 6.6% of GDP in 2009–10 to a target of 3.0% by 2014–15&lt;ref name=Skoch&gt;{{cite web|last=Taraport|first=S.S.|title=Budget 2011–12: Need For an Equitable Fiscal Consolidation|url=http://www.inclusion.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=582|work=Inclusion|publisher=Skoch Media Pvt. Ltd.|access-date=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, eminent economist and ex-RBI Deputy Governor, [[S.S. Tarapore]] is quick to highlight the use of [[creative accounting]] to misrepresent numbers in the past. Furthermore, he added that fiscal consolidation is indeed vital for India, as long as the needs of the poor citizens are not marginalised. This need for financial inclusion of the poor while maintaining the fiscal discipline was highlighted by him as the most critical requirement for the 2011–12 [[Union budget of India|Budget of India]].

More recently, in February 2011, the [[PMEAC]] recommended the need for reinstatement of fiscal discipline of the [[Government of India]], starting 2011–12 financial year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In FY 2011–12, it was almost certain that government would cross the budgetary fiscal deficit target of 4.6% and it would be around 5%.

==State-level fiscal responsibility legislations in India==
The tenth plan of the [[Planning Commission of India]] highlighted the need for fiscal discipline at the level of the states.&lt;ref name="IE2"/&gt; This was to reduce the [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] of India. [[Reserve Bank of India]](RBI),in its role as the ultimate financial authority in India, was also a keen supporter of the concept and publicly highlighted the need for state level fiscal responsibility legislation in India.&lt;ref name="TFE1"/&gt; By 2007, the states of [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], Nadu, [[Maharashtra]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]] are among those which have already legislated the required fiscal discipline laws at the state level.&lt;ref name="CBGA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WB&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiscal Responsibility Legislation at the State Level in India: is it working?|url=http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/239556/Howes.pdf|work=Stephen Howes|publisher=World Bank|access-date=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FRBM Review Committee of 2016==
Finance Minister [[Arun Jaitley]] announced the FRBM Review Committee to be set up in the [[Union budget of India 2016|budget speech]] of February 2016–17. The [[Government of India]] had set up a review committee to evaluate the FRBM Act, 2003[5] in order to assess its functionality in the last 12 years. The five-member panel announced by the [[Finance minister of India|finance minister]] includes Former Revenue Secretary and Secretary to the Prime Minister of India [[N. K. Singh]] as its chairman, former Finance Secretary Sumit Bose, [[Chief Economic Adviser to the Government of India|Chief Economic Adviser]] [[Arvind Subramanian]], [[Reserve Bank of India]] Governor [[Urjit Patel]] and [[National Institute of Public Finance and Policy]] Director Dr Rathin Roy. The committee had wide-ranging terms of reference (ToR) to comprehensively review the existing FRBM Act in the light of contemporary changes, past outcomes, global economic developments, best international practices and to recommend the future fiscal framework and roadmap for the country.  Subsequently, the Terms of Reference were enlarged to seek the committee's views on certain recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission and the Expenditure Management Commission.  These primarily related to strengthening the institutional framework on fiscal matters as well as certain issues connected with new capital expenditures in the [[Union budget of India|budget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=157603|title=The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Committee headed by Shri N.K.

He mentioned the recommendations of the FRBM Review Committee Report being taken into consideration while keeping the targets for both Fiscal Deficit and Revenue Deficit. The government has also reduced revenue deficit to 2.1% of GDP in 2016–17 from the budget estimate of 2.3% of GDP and has pegged it at 1.9% of GDP for 2017–18 from 2% of GDP as mandated by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/rkh0BNb6dWpRJyyolGj2oK/Budget-2017-Arun-Jaitley-pegs-fiscal-deficit-at-32-of-GDP.html|title=Budget 2017: Arun Jaitley pegs fiscal deficit at 3.2% of GDP for 2017-18|first=Asit Ranjan|last=Mishra|date=1 February 2017|website=Livemint.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian, who was also a member of the FRBM Review Committee, has published his own dissent note in Annexure 5 of the report submitted to the Government of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/chief-economic-advisor-submits-dissent-note-on-frbm-panel-report/articleshow/58155933.cms|title=Chief economic advisor submits dissent note on FRBM panel report|author=|date=13 April 2017|publisher=|access-date=16 July 2017|via=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}
In [[contract law]], the '''implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing''' is a general presumption that the parties to a contract will deal with each other honestly, fairly, and in good faith, so as to not destroy the right of the other party or parties to receive the benefits of the contract. It is implied in every contract in order to reinforce the express covenants or promises of the contract. A lawsuit (or a [[causes of action|cause of action]]) based upon the breach of the [[Covenant (law)|covenant]] may arise when one party to the contract attempts to claim '''the benefit of a technical excuse for breaching the contract, or when he or she uses specific contractual terms in isolation in order to refuse to perform his or her contractual obligations,''' despite the general circumstances and understandings between the parties. When a court or triar or fact interprets a contract, there is always an "implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing" in every written agreement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acc.com/chapters/del/upload/2014-02-12_Stradley-Ronon_Good_Faith_Presentation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In U.S. law, the legal concept of '''implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing''' arose in the mid-19th century because contemporary legal interpretations of “the express contract language, interpreted strictly, appeared to grant unbridled discretion to one of the parties”.&lt;ref name=Dubroff2006&gt;Dubroff H. (2006). The Implied Covenant of Good Faith in Contract Interpretation and Gap-filling: Reviling a Revered Relic. St. John’s Law Review. [http://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1200&amp;context=lawreview Free full-text].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, in the case of ''[[Kirke La Shelle]] Company v. The Paul Armstrong Company et al.'' 263 N.Y. 79; 188 N.E. 163; 1933 N.Y., the New York Court of Appeals said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In every contract there is an implied covenant that neither party shall do anything, which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party, to receive the fruits of the contract. In other words, every contract has an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, the covenant was discussed in the [[Restatements of the Law|First Restatement of Contracts]] by the [[American Law Institute]], but before adoption of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] in the 1950s, the [[common law]] of most states did not recognize an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in [[contract]]s.&lt;ref name=Dubroff2006/&gt;. Certain states, such as Massachusetts, have stricter enforcement than others. For example, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will assess punitive damages under Chapter 93A which governs Unfair and Deceptive Business Practices, and a party found to have violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing under 93A may be liable for punitive damages, legal fees and treble damages. &lt;ref&gt;https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXV/Chapter93A/&lt;/ref&gt; 


==In criminal law==

In the [[Indian Penal Code]], "good faith" is defined under Section 52 as ''Nothing is said to be done or believed in "good faith" which is done or believed without due care and attention.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |mode=cs1 |section-url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1180351/ |title=Central Government Act |section=Section 52 of the Indian Penal Code |via= Indian Kanoon |access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Privy Council expanded on this meaning in the case of ''Muhammad Ishaq v. The Emperor'' (1914), in which it held that an action taken by the defendant based on a belief of having a decree passed in his favour, was illegal since he could have found out that he in fact did not enjoy any such favourable decree, if he had inquired with a little more care and attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/911823/|last=Piggott|section=|website=indiankanoon.org|title=Muhammad Ishaq vs Emperor|date=2 April 1914|place=Allahabad High Court|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary usage ==
The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is especially important in U.S. law. It was incorporated into the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (as part of Section 1-304), and was codified by the American Law Institute as Section 205 of the [[Restatements of the Law|Restatement (Second) of Contracts]].&lt;ref name=Dubroff2006/&gt;

Most U.S. jurisdictions view the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing solely as a variant of breach of [[contract]], in which the implied covenant is merely a "gap-filler" that provides yet another contractual term, and breach thereof simply gives rise to ordinary contractual damages. Of course, this is not the most ideal rule for plaintiffs, since consequential damages for breach of contract are subject to certain limitations (see ''[[Hadley v. Baxendale]]'').

In certain jurisdictions, breach of the implied covenant can also give rise to a [[tort]] action, e.g. ''A.C. Shaw Construction v. Washoe County'', 105 Nevada 913, 915, 784 P.2d 9, 10 (1989).&lt;ref&gt;See ''A.C. Shaw Construction v. Washoe County'', 105 Nev. 913, 915, 784 P.2d 9, 10 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; This rule is most prevalent in insurance law, when the insurer's breach of the implied covenant may give rise to a tort action known as [[insurance bad faith]]. The advantage of tort liability is that it supports broader [[compensatory damages]] as well as the possibility of [[punitive damages]].

Some plaintiffs have attempted to persuade courts to extend tort liability for breach of the implied covenant from insurers to other powerful defendants like employers and banks. However, most U.S. courts have followed the example of certain landmark decisions from California courts, which rejected such tort liability against employers in 1988&lt;ref&gt;''Foley v. Interactive Data Corp.'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C3/47C3d654.htm 47 Cal. 3d 654, 665] (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; and against banks in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;''Price v. Wells Fargo Bank'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA3/213CA3d465.htm 213 Cal. App. 3d 465] (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of Canada|Canadian Supreme Court]] created a new common law [[duty of honest contractual performance]] in 2014 in its ruling on the case of ''[[Bhasin v. Hrynew]]'' &lt;ref&gt;https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14438/index.do SCC 71&lt;/ref&gt;

English private law has traditionally been averse to general clauses and has repeatedly rejected the adoption of good faith as a core concept of private law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Good_Faith_in_European_Contract_Law.html?id=B4AvUL3Xq7EC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Good Faith in European Contract Law|last=Zimmermann|first=Reinhard|last2=Whittaker|first2=Simon|date=2000-06-08|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521771900|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past thirty years, EU law has injected the notion of "good faith" into confined areas of English private law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Good_Faith_in_Contract.html?id=1n46AQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Good Faith in Contract: Concept and Context|last=Brownsword|first=Roger|last2=Hird|first2=Norma J.|last3=Howells|first3=Geraint G.|date=1999|publisher=Ashgate/Dartmouth|isbn=9781855219250|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these EU interventions have concerned the protection of consumers in their interactions with businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/eu-consumer-law-and-policy?___website=uk_warehouse|title=EU Consumer Law and Policy|website=www.e-elgar.com|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only Directive 86/653/EEC on the co-ordination of the laws of the Member States relating to self-employed commercial agents has brought "good faith" to English commercial law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tosato|first=Andrea|date=2016-09-01|title=Commercial Agency and the Duty to Act in Good Faith|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/ojls/gqv040|journal=Oxford Journal of Legal Studies|language=en|volume=36|issue=3|pages=661–695|doi=10.1093/ojls/gqv040|issn=0143-6503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gordys''' are an [[African American|African-American]] family of [[businessperson|businesspeople]] and [[music industry]] [[Senior management|executives]]. They were born to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]-reared parents Berry "Pops" Gordy Sr. and Bertha Fuller Gordy and raised in [[Detroit]], where most of the siblings played a pivotal role in the international acceptance of [[rhythm and blues]] music as a crossover phenomenon in the 1960s. The accomplishment is attributable to the creation of [[Motown]], a company founded by the seventh-oldest sibling, [[Berry Gordy|Berry Gordy Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/motown-records-kicks-off-50th-anniversary-celebration-20090112 Motown Records Kicks Off 50th Anniversary Celebration]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Businesspeople, musicians, recording artists and executives within the family==
===Berry and Bertha Gordy===
As a couple, Berry and Bertha owned several businesses, including a successful painting business that they established, and a construction firm. Berry Sr. (or Berry II) established a [[Booker T. Washington]] grocery store in Detroit, while Bertha co-founded the Friendship Mutual Life Insurance Company. Later, Berry Sr. mentored several recording acts for his son's [[Motown Records|Motown]] label.

Bertha died in 1975.  Berry II died in 1978. A tribute album, called ''Pops, We Love You!'', and single, called "[[Pops, We Love You (A Tribute to Father)]]", were released later that year in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/40676225 Berry Gordy Sr. – Find A Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/40676238 Bertha Fuller Gordy – Find A Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuller Berry Gordy===
The eldest Gordy child, Fuller B. Gordy (September 9, 1918 – November 9, 1991), born in Georgia, was an executive alongside his younger siblings in their brother Berry's Motown music company. Fuller was also a professional in bowling. His daughter Iris was married to singer Johnny Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/54992100 Fuller Gordy – Find A Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Esther Gordy Edwards]]===
The eldest Gordy daughter, Esther (April 25, 1920 – August 24, 2011), born in Georgia, established herself early in business as a political campaigner for her husband, Detroit politician George Edwards. In the late 1950s, she formed a loan company named after her parents; in 1959, she helped her brother Berry with a $800 loan to start [[Motown|Tamla Records]]. She borrowed the proceeds from the college tuition fund their father had established for Berry. Edwards served as mentor, adviser, and vice president of Motown's main offices from 1961 until 1972, when Berry moved the entire operation to [[Los Angeles]]. In 1985, she founded the Motown Historical Museum at the site of the former [[Hitsville U.S.A.]] studios, where many of Motown's successful recording artists recorded. Esther died in 2011 at the age of 91.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75652680 Esther Gordy Edwards – Find A Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Anna Gordy Gaye]]===
Though she is often remembered more for her volatile marriage to Motown legend [[Marvin Gaye]], Anna Ruby Gordy (January 28, 1922 – January 31, 2014), the third and last child born in Georgia prior to the family's move to Detroit, was one of Motown's earliest songwriters, penning several hits mainly for her first (and only) husband. Anna also co-founded a self-named music label ([[Anna Records]]) that would establish Motown's records nationally, such as [[Barrett Strong]]'s "[[Money (That's What I Want)]]". In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Anna co-wrote [[The Originals (band)|The Originals]]' biggest hits, "[[Baby I'm For Real]]" and "[[The Bells (The Originals song)|The Bells]]", alongside Marvin.  She also co-wrote "[[God Is Love (song)|God Is Love]]" and "[[Flying High (In the Friendly Sky)]]" on Marvin's famed ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' album. Despite an acrimonious divorce in 1977, Gordy remained friends with Gaye until his 1984 death, after which Anna retreated into seclusion, only coming out briefly to celebrate Marvin's music career by attending ceremonies, including Marvin's 1987 induction to the [[Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame]]. Anna died in 2014 at the age of 92.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave |grid=124409297 |name=Anna Gordy Gaye }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loucye Gordy Wakefield===
Another astute businesswoman, Loucye (1924 – July 24, 1965) was named head of Jobete Music, Motown's main publishing division created by Berry. Loucye headed the division until her sudden death from brain cancer in 1965. Her youngest brother Robert succeeded her as the publishing company's head. At the time of her death on July 24, 1965, she went by the name Loucye S. Gordy Wakefield.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/54992133 Loucye Gordy Wakefield – Find A Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Gordy===
George Weldon Gordy Sr. (January 7, 1926 – July 27, 2011) started several short businesses before joining his brother's Motown label in 1960, where he was a co-writer of several songs released by Motown artists. By his wife Rosemary (who died in 1980), he had six sons and two daughters. He died in his sleep at the age of 85.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/176651655 George Gordy – Find A Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Gwen Gordy Fuqua]]===
Another important member of Motown's growing success was Gwendolyn Gordy (November 26, 1927 – November 8, 1999). Gwen partnered with her brother Berry and then-boyfriend Billy Davis to co-pen several hits for [[Jackie Wilson]] in the mid-1950s. In 1959, Gwen, Billy and sister Anna formed Anna Records in Detroit. Anna would be the site where the hit song, "[[Money (That's What I Want)]]", then a regional single for Berry's Tamla Records, would get its first national distribution. Two years later, Anna Records was absorbed by Motown. In 1961, Gwen married [[The Moonglows]]' [[Harvey Fuqua]] and the two presided over the labels Harvey Records and Tri-Phi Records; the latter label represented acts such as [[The Spinners (American band)|The Spinners]]. By 1964, Gwen joined Motown's staff songwriting team, later writing "[[Distant Lover]]" for her brother-in-law, Marvin Gaye, and discovering the disco group [[High Inergy]] in 1976. Gwen died of cancer in 1999 at the age of 72.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/55084710 Gwendolyn Gordy Fuqua – Find A Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Berry Gordy]]===
A former boxer and jazz record store owner, Berry Gordy Jr. (November 28, 1929 – ), first got involved with producing and writing [[R&amp;B]] songs in 1955. Amongst Gordy's earliest songwriting successes were songs he penned as one-third of the songwriting team behind [[Jackie Wilson]]'s first legion of solo hits, including "[[Reet Petite]]", "To Be Loved" and "[[Lonely Teardrops]]". By 1959, Gordy, fed up with not being paid royalties for his work with Wilson and other acts, decided to form a record label.  He convinced his sister Esther to loan him $800 from the tuition fund his father had established for him and formed Tamla Records in January of that year. The label didn't become national until later that year after the success of [[Barrett Strong]]'s "[[Money (That's What I Want)]]",  and the label changed its name to Motown Records in December. Its first national release was [[The Miracles]]' "Way Over There". After 1964, Motown became one of the most successful recording labels in the business and "The Motown Sound", partially cultivated by Gordy, began to dominate popular music and pop culture. Gordy soon developed Motown Industries in 1968, which developed television specials and variety shows. By 1973, Motown had produced more than 100 top ten and number-one singles on various [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] and had become the most successful black business company ever. By founding Motown Records, Gordy became the first African-American owner of a major recording label. He retired from being president of Motown Records in 1973 and from Motown Industries in 1988; he sold Motown's interest for $61 million to [[MCA Records]] and Boston Ventures. Gordy was inducted to the [[Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame]] for his musical achievements the same year he sold Motown.

===[[Robert Gordy]]===
Robert Louis Gordy (July 15, 1931 – ) is best known for playing a cameo in the [[Diana Ross]]-starring vehicle ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'', playing a drug dealer named "Hawk". Also an early songwriter of several songs for the Motown label, Gordy recorded a 1958 novelty hit, titled "Everyone Was There",  under the stage name Bob Kayli. He replaced Loucye Gordy as head of Jobete Music Publishing in 1965 after Loucye's death. Gordy is the father of Robert Louis Gordy Jr.

==Music groups formed consisting of family members==
===[[Apollo (quintet)|Apollo]]===
A quintet formed by [[Kerry Gordy]] and his friends. Also in this group was Kerry's half-brother Cliff Liles, a son by [[Ray Singleton|Raynoma Mayberry Liles]] and Charles Liles.

===[[LMFAO]]===
A duo consisting of Skyler Austen ("[[Sky Blu (rapper)|Sky Blu]]") Gordy (born August 23, 1986), grandson of Berry Gordy Jr. and Thelma Coleman through their son Berry Gordy IV and his wife Valerie Robeson, and Stefan Kendal ("[[Redfoo]]") Gordy (born September 3, 1975), son of Berry Gordy Jr. and Nancy Leiviska.

==Other family members==
===[[Iris Gordy]]===
Iris Gordy (1943 – ) served as a vice president at [[Motown]], where she helped launch the careers of [[DeBarge]], [[Teena Marie]], and [[Rick James]]. She currently sits on the board of the [[Rhythm and Blues Foundation]].&lt;ref name='R&amp;B'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rhythm-n-blues.org/board.php?member=igordy |title= About The Foundation: Board |publisher= Rhythm &amp; Blues Foundation |location= [[United States]] | accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iris is the daughter of Fuller Gordy.

===[[Kerry Gordy]]===
Son of Berry Gordy Jr. and his second wife, Raynoma Mayberry, was a member of the band [[Apollo (quintet)|Apollo]], which released an album on Gordy Records in 1979.  Later, he worked as a staff writer and producer at Motown under his given name, Kerry Ashby.  He continues to work as an entertainment industry executive today.

===[[Rockwell (musician)|Rockwell]]===
Son of Berry Gordy Jr. and former girlfriend Margaret Norton, Kennedy William Gordy changed his name to Rockwell in 1983 to become a rock star. The singer, who earned his deal with Motown without his father's knowledge, recorded his biggest hit, 1984's "[[Somebody's Watching Me]]", which included background vocals by [[Michael Jackson]]. The song rose to number-two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Rockwell turned out to be a [[one-hit wonder]] and after two more albums, he retired from music in the late 1980s.

===[[Rhonda Ross Kendrick]]===
Daughter of Berry Gordy Jr. and [[Diana Ross]], Rhonda garnered fame as an actress, first in the daytime soap ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'' for which she was nominated for a Daytime Emmy and later in films like ''[[The Temptations (TV miniseries)|The Temptations]]'', where she played Temptations original member [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]]' wife. She later embarked on a jazz career, which continues today.

===[[Redfoo]]===
Son of Berry Gordy Jr. and Nancy Leiviska, Stefan Kendal Gordy is better known by his [[stage name]] Redfoo.

'''James Alfred Field''' (May 26, 1880 – July 16, 1927&lt;ref name="CC 1928"&gt;Frank Moore Colby, Allen Leon Churchill, Herbert Treadwell Wade (1928) ''The New international year book.'' p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;) was an American economist and Professor of Political Economy at the [[University of Chicago]], known as one of the proponents of [[institutional economics]]&lt;ref name="MR 2011 126-151"&gt;Malcolm Rutherford (2011). ''The Institutionalist Movement in American Economics.'' p. 126-151&lt;/ref&gt; and as [[demographer]], who contributed to the [[Demography|theory of population]] and its history.&lt;ref name="NEH 1913"/&gt;

== Life and work ==
Born in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], Field obtained his MS in economics at Harvard University in 1903, and continued to do post-graduate work at Harvard and at the [[University of Berlin]].&lt;ref name="CC 1928"/&gt;

Field started his academic career in 1903 as assistant in economics at Harvard University, and became Austin teaching fellow in economics for a year, and instructor in 1906 to 1908. From 1906 to 1908 he was also instructor in economics at Radcliffe College. In 1908 he started at the [[University of Chicago]] as instructor in economics, and was promoted assistant professor in 1910, associate professor in 1913, and full professor in 1918&lt;ref name="CC 1928"/&gt; until his death in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Rosanna Ledbetter (1976) ''A history of the Malthusian League, 1877-1927.'' p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 1923-24 he was also dean of the College of Arts and Literature.&lt;ref name="CC 1928"/&gt;

Filed was also known as founding president of the Illinois Birth Control League,&lt;ref&gt;''Population in Perspective,'' 1968, p. 448&lt;/ref&gt; and  associate editor of the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]],'' and during [[World War I]] was special investigator for the  [[Council of National Defense]] in its division of [[statistics]]. He was elected fellow of the [[American Statistical Association]].&lt;ref name="CC 1928"/&gt;

== Work ==
Field came into prominence in the years from 1913 to 1919, when he was involved with professor of Economics [[Leon C. Marshall]] and the economic historian [[Chester W. Wright]] in "attempts to move economics instruction away from the 'rigorous drill in orthodox theory' or the 'straight-jacket of conventional theory' to a method of instruction emphasizing the development of economic institutions, inquiry into current problems and issues, and fostering of creativity and originality (field 1917). To this end, they produced a book of readings to supplement the usual texts (Marshall, Wright, and Field 1913)."&lt;ref name="MR 2011 132"&gt;Malcolm Rutherford (2011). ''The Institutionalist Movement in American Economics.'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Essays on population, and other papers,'' 1931 ===
In a 1931 review of "Essays on population, and other papers" in ''The Eugenics Review'' [[Norman E. Himes]] (1899-1949), wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;THIS volume, by one of the greatest demographers America has produced, is a notable contribution to population thought and its history. An original, meticulously accurate scholar, Field has, unfortunately, been little known to European, and especially to Continental scholars. It is a great service, therefore, that one of his students should collect his more important scattered papers and notes, and edit them so ably. The solidity of the volume is matched by a felicity of literary presentation rarely found among economic writers; a combination especially refreshing in this day in America when, with growing numbers in our colleges, almost every underpaid professor becomes the hack author of a dull, poorly-written text-book.&lt;br&gt;The range of topics is wide. Part I contains twelve essays on eugenics, birth control, and Malthusianism, the treatment being essentially historical and critical. Part II collects three papers on economics and statistics, while Part III is a catalogue of the author's library on population. Since the Dictionary of American Biography has failed to include the career of Field, it is fitting that the editor has added a short biography together with a distinctive photograph of the author.&lt;ref name="NEH 1913"&gt;Himes, Norman E. "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2985062/pdf/eugenrev00304-0065.pdf Essays on population and other papers by James Alfred Field, together with material from his notes and lectures compiled and edited by Helen Fisher Hohman, with a foreword by James Bonar, LL. D.]" ''The Eugenics Review'' 23.3 (1931): 258-261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And more specific about its content:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have always felt-perhaps there is a personal bias-that Essay III on "The Early Propagandist Movement in English Population Theory" was the best paper Field ever published. I know of no finer example of historico-economic research in the English language, no matter what tests are applied. Though Professor [[Graham Wallas]] deserves credit also, it is not an ungenerous distinction to say that Field was the first scholar to appraise in full measure [[Francis Place]]'s efforts for birth control at the beginning of the last century. Much of the Place correspondence which Dr. Stopes has upon various occasions claimed to have " discovered " was known to, and used by, Field.&lt;br&gt;Essays IV, V, and IX are specifically on eugenics. They are Galtonian in idealism; but the author is mindful of the numerous difficulties. The article reprinted from the Quarterly Journal of Economics is an excellent historical and critical review of euge-nical literature produced up to the time of
publication (1911). Regrettably, the author never followed it up.&lt;ref name="NEH 1913"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Retrieved 20 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Born in [[Barcelona, Spain]], Juan Bigas Moulins immigrated to Puerto Rico when he was eight years old. His parents were Francisco Bigas and Margarita Moulins.&lt;ref name=AlbumHistorico277&gt;Luis Fortuño Janeiro. ''Album Histórico de Ponce (1692–1963).'' Page 282. (Ponce, Puerto Rico: Imprenta Fortuño. 1963.)&lt;/ref&gt; His father established a bakery in [[Peñuelas, Puerto Rico|Peñuelas]], and by age 12 Bigas Moulins was helping in his father's business.

==Business==
Upon the death of his father, Bigas Moulins moved the Peñuelas bakery to the corner of [[Plaza Degetau]] and Corcordia streets in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], converting it into a flour and dry goods business called "La Catalina".&lt;ref name="AlbumHistorico277"/&gt; The company operated in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/fdanj/bitstream/123456789/46832/4/FDNJ14855.pdf ''14855.

'''Julius Heinrich Dorpmueller''' (24 July 1869 – 5 July 1945) was [[general manager]] of [[Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft]] from 1926 to 1945 and the [[List of German transportation ministers|Reich Minister for Transport]] from 1937 to 1945.

== Life ==
Dorpmueller was the son of a railway engineer, and studied railway and road construction from 1889 to 1893. After graduating in 1898, Dorpmueller was active in the [[Prussia]]n state railway administration. In 1907 he stepped down as an executive of the technical office and went into the service of the Schantung railway in [[Tsingtao]]. In 1908 he was appointed chief engineer for the German section of the new Chinese Imperial state [[Tianjin-Pukou railway]]. Due to the declaration of war by China against the [[German Reich]], he returned as a [[refugee]] in 1918, passing through [[Manchuria]], [[Siberia]] and [[Russia]] to Germany. In the [[light railway]] service he was active in the management of the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] railways. In 1919 he became departmental head with German Reich Railways (''[[Deutsche Reichseisenbahnen]]'') in the Stettin district. From 1922 to 30 September 1924 he was a president in the ''Deutsche Reichseisenbahnen'' in the [[Opole|Oppeln]] district, and from 1 October 1924 to 1925 he was president in the Ruhr district; due to his comprehensive experience in light railways, Dorpmueller was consulted as part of the [[Dawes plan]].

After 1925 the board of directors of the German Reich Railway (''[[Deutsche Reichsbahn Gesellschaft]]'') created a position entitled Permanent Representative of the general manager (Head of the Railway), as general manager [[Rudolf Oeser]] was seriously ill; Dorpmueller was appointed to this post on 3 July 1925. In December 1925 [[RWTH Aachen]], in acknowledgment of his services to railways awarded him a doctorate in engineering. On 3 June 1926, the day of Rudolf Oeser's death he was selected by the board of directors to become the German railway's general manager. Due to political considerations it was only confirmed on 18 October 1926 by the [[President of Germany (Weimar Republic)|President of Germany]].

After the [[Nazi seizure of power]] Dorpmüller replaced nearly all "non-Aryan" workers with National Socialists. Dorpmüller became Reich Transport Minister on 2 February 1937 after the resignation of his predecessor [[Paul Freiherr von Eltz-Rübenach]]. In April 1938, when a Berlin train stopped in Passau, Dorpmüller was ceremonially welcomed and escorted to the Danube, where he continued his trip to Linz and Vienna on board the Austrian ''Wotan''.&lt;ref name="Anna"&gt;Anna Rosmus ''Hitlers Nibelungen'', Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 158f&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July 1939 the "law concerning the ''[[Deutsche Reichsbahn]]''" (German Reich Railway) was issued and Dorpmüller was confirmed as transport minister and also General Manager of the ''Deutsche Reichsbahn''.

According to [[Albert Speer]], Dorpmüller confessed that "The Reichsbahn has so few cars and locomotives available for the German area that it can no longer assume responsibility for meeting the most urgent transportation needs."  Speer then convinced Hitler to name [[Albert Ganzenmüller]] state secretary under Dorpmüller.&lt;ref name="Speer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Speer|first1=Albert|title=Inside the Third Reich|date=1995|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9781842127353|pages=311-312}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dorpmüller stayed in post until the formation of the 1945 [[Flensburg government]]. The British then asked Dorpmueller to take over reconstruction of the German railways: Dorpmueller and his representative [[Albert Ganzenmüller]] were brought by air, by the United States, to Chesnay in Paris, in order to meet for negotiations over the reorganization of German transport. The American general Carl R Gray Jr had expressly recommended Dorpmueller to General [[Dwight D Eisenhower]] for "re-instatement to his old office", because he – as also "our secret service confirms" – had been neither a "Nazi sympathizer nor activist". With difficulty, as he was suffering from cancer, Dorpmueller returned on 13 June 1945 to Malente and from there, gave advice on reconstruction. On 23 June 1945 he was operated on – again – but his digestive system no longer functioned, so his health deteriorated rapidly. Despite this, he led official discussions, in full coherence, until two days before his death.

Dorpmueller died on 5 July 1945 and was buried in Malente.

== After his death ==
In accordance with an October 1949 letter from Lübeck's [[denazification]] main committee to Maria Dorpmueller, Julius's sister, he was said to have obtained "relief" under category V classification. In the honours lists of the Aachen university 1995 anniversary publication, he was listed as an honorary doctor (1925) and an honorary senator (1939), with no further details. In the [[Nuremberg]] transport museum and in the "Dorpmueller Hall" of the main station of [[Hanover]] there were [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]]s of Dorpmueller, until 1985, when they were removed during preparations for celebration of the [[sesquicentenary]] of the introduction of railways to Germany. In the [[Essen]] railway's head office there was once a "Dorpmueller room", which was renamed in 1985 to "Small meeting room"; the bust there also disappeared. Roads in the cities [[Wuppertal]], [[Minden]] and [[Hameln]], were originally named after Dorpmuller and have also been renamed.

In September 1994, someone from Ratingen complained to German railways about Dorpmüller's "badly maintained" grave. In a letter from them in response in January 1995, they said that the former BD Hamburg had maintained the grave until the end of 1991, a decision by the former executive committee of the German Federal Railroads meant there was no more provision for maintenance thereafter. In the middle of 1995, someone from Hamburg tidied up the grave and took over care at their own expense.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In [[economics]], the '''Leontief production function''' or '''fixed proportions production function''' is a [[production function]] that implies the [[factors of production]] will be used in fixed (technologically pre-determined) proportions, as there is no [[substitute good|substitutability]] between factors. It was named after [[Wassily Leontief]] and represents a [[Limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of the [[constant elasticity of substitution]] production function.

For the simple case of a good that is produced with two inputs, the function is of the form

:&lt;math&gt;q = \text{Min}\left(\frac{z_1}{a},\frac{z_2}{b}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''q'' is the quantity of output produced, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the utilised quantities of input 1 and input 2 respectively, and ''a'' and ''b'' are technologically determined constants.

==Example==

Suppose that the intermediate goods "tires" and "steering wheels" are used in the production of automobiles (for simplicity of the example, to the exclusion of anything else). Then in the above formula ''q'' refers to the number of automobiles produced, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the number of tires used, and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the number of steering wheels used. Assuming each car is produced with 4 tires and 1 steering wheel, the Leontief production function is

:Number of cars = Min{¼  times the number of tires, 1 times the number of steering wheels}.

[[File:Liquidnitrogen.jpg|thumb|Liquid nitrogen]]
'''Liquefaction of gases''' is physical conversion of a [[gas]] into a [[liquid]] state ([[condensation]]).

==Details==
The processes are used for scientific, industrial and commercial purposes. Many gases can be put into a liquid state at normal [[atmospheric pressure]] by simple cooling; a few, such as [[carbon dioxide]], require pressurization as well. [[Liquefaction]] is used for analyzing the fundamental properties of gas molecules (intermolecular forces), for storage of gases, for example: [[liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], and in [[refrigeration]] and [[air conditioning]]. There the gas is liquefied in the ''[[condenser (laboratory)|condenser]]'', where the [[heat of vaporization]] is released, and evaporated in the ''[[evaporator]],'' where the heat of vaporization is absorbed. [[Ammonia]] was the first such [[refrigerant]], and is still in widespread use in industrial refrigeration, but it has largely been replaced by compounds derived from [[petroleum]] and [[halogen]]s in residential and commercial applications.  

[[Liquid oxygen]] is provided to hospitals for conversion to gas for patients with breathing problems, and [[liquid nitrogen]] is used in the medical field for [[cryosurgery]], and by inseminators to freeze [[semen]]. Liquefied [[chlorine]] is transported for eventual solution in water, after which  it is used for water purification, sanitation of [[industrial waste]], sewage and swimming pools, bleaching of pulp and textiles and manufacture of [[carbon tetrachloride]], [[glycol]] and numerous other organic compounds as well as [[phosgene]] gas.

Liquefaction of [[helium]] ([[Liquid helium|&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He]]) with the precooled [[Hampson–Linde cycle]] led to a [[Nobel Prize]] for [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] in 1913. At ambient pressure the boiling point of [[liquid helium|liquefied helium]] is {{convert|4.22|K|°C|abbr=on}}.  Below 2.17&amp;nbsp;K liquid &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He becomes a [[superfluid]] ([[Nobel Prize]] 1978, [[Pyotr Kapitsa]]) and shows characteristic properties such as heat conduction through [[second sound]], zero [[viscosity]] and the [[Superfluid helium-4|fountain effect]] among others.

The liquefaction of gases is a complicated process that uses various compressions and expansions to achieve high pressures and very low temperatures, using, for example, [[turboexpander]]s.  

The liquefaction of air is used to obtain [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[argon]] and other atmospheric [[noble gas]]es by separating the air components by [[fractional distillation]] in a [[Air separation|cryogenic air separation unit]].

==History==

{{see|Timeline of low-temperature technology}}

==Liquid air==

{{main|Liquid air}}

===Linde's process===

Air is liquefied by the [[Linde process]], in which air is alternately compressed, cooled, and expanded, each expansion results in a considerable reduction in temperature. With the lower temperature the molecules move more slowly and occupy less space, so the air changes phase to become liquid.

===Claude's process===
Air can also be liquefied by [[Georges Claude|Claude]]'s process in which the gas is allowed to expand [[isentropic process|isentropically]] twice in two chambers. While expanding, the gas has to do work as it is led through an [[expansion turbine]]. The gas is not yet liquid, since that would destroy the turbine. Commercial air liquefication plants bypass this problem by expanding the air at [[supercritical fluid|supercritical]] pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Industrial Gases |last=Greenwood |first=Harold Cecil |year=1919 |publisher=D. Van Nostrand |page=87 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qz9DAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Final liquefaction takes place by [[isenthalpic process|isenthalpic]] expansion in a [[thermal expansion valve]].

[[Image:Naked short.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Schematic representation of naked short selling in two steps. The short seller sells shares without owning them. He then purchases and delivers the shares for a different market price.

'''Naked short selling''', or '''naked shorting''', is the practice of [[Short (finance)|short-selling]] a [[financial instrument|tradable asset of any kind]] without first [[Securities lending|borrowing the security]] or ensuring that the security can be borrowed, as is conventionally done in a short sale.  When the seller does not obtain the shares within the required time frame, the result is known as a "[[failure to deliver]]".  The transaction generally remains open until the shares are acquired by the seller, or the seller's broker settles the trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Short selling is used to anticipate a price fall, but exposes the seller to the risk of a price rise.

In 2008, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] banned what it called "abusive naked short selling"&lt;ref name=2009-172 /&gt; in the United States, as well as some other jurisdictions, as a method of driving down share prices. Failing to deliver shares is legal under certain circumstances, and naked short selling is not ''per se'' illegal.&lt;ref name="Schapiro testimony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-docs/2010-01-14%20Mary%20Schapiro%20Written%20Testimony.pdf|title=Testimony of Mary Schapiro, Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission|publisher=Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission|date=Jan 14, 2010|page=22|accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KeyPoints/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ_July2007&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=

Critics, including [[Overstock.com]]'s [[Patrick M. Byrne]], have advocated for stricter regulations against naked short selling. In 2005, "[[Regulation SHO]]" was enacted; requiring that broker-dealers have grounds to believe that shares will be available for a given stock transaction, and requiring that delivery take place within a limited time period.&lt;ref name=KeyPoints&gt;

According to data compiled by the SEC and Bloomberg, naked short selling of the shares of Lehman Brothers may have played a role in the North American markets crisis of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Naked short sales hint fraud in bringing down Lehman |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/naked-short-sales-hint-fraud-in-bringing-down-lehman-109032000046_1.html |work=Business Standard India |date=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its response to the crisis, the SEC issued a temporary order restricting short-selling in the shares of 19 financial firms deemed systemically important, by reinforcing the penalties for failing to deliver the shares in time.&lt;ref&gt;

Effective September 18, 2008, amid claims that aggressive short selling had played a role in the failure of financial giant [[Lehman Brothers]], the SEC extended and expanded the rules to remove exceptions and to cover all companies, including [[market maker]]s.&lt;ref name=2009-172&gt;{{citation

A 2014 study by researchers at the University at Buffalo, published in the Journal of Financial Economics, found no evidence that failure to deliver stock "caused price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis" and that "greater FTDs lead to higher liquidity and pricing efficiency, and their impact is similar to our estimate of delivered short sales."&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X14001597 | doi=10.1016/j.jfineco.2014.07.012 | volume=114 | title=Fails-to-deliver, short selling, and market quality | journal=Journal of Financial Economics | pages=493–516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have contended that despite regulations, naked shorting is widespread and that the SEC regulations are poorly enforced.  Its critics have contended that the practice is susceptible to abuse, can be damaging to targeted companies struggling to raise capital, and has led to numerous bankruptcies.&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watch Out, They Bite!"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html|title=Watch Out, They Bite!|first=Daniel|last=Kadlec|date=9 November 2005|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other commentators have said that the naked shorting issue is a "devil theory",&lt;ref name='Bankinvestors'/&gt; not a ''bona fide'' market issue and a waste of regulatory resources.&lt;ref name='Donlan'/&gt;

==Description==

=== "Normal" shorting ===

{{Main|Short (finance)}}
Short selling is a form of [[speculation]] that allows a [[trader (finance)|trader]] to take a "[[position (finance)|negative position]]" in a stock of a company.  Such a trader first "[[Securities lending|borrows]]" shares of that stock from their owner (the lender), typically via a [[bank]] or a [[prime broker]] under the condition that he will return it on demand. Next, the trader sells the borrowed shares and delivers them to the buyer who becomes their new owner.  The buyer is typically unaware that the shares have been sold short: his transaction with the trader proceeds just as if the trader owned rather than borrowed the shares. Some time later, the trader closes his short position by purchasing the same number of shares in the market and returning them to the lender.

The trader's profit is the difference between the sale price and the purchase price of the shares.  In contrast to "going long"  where sale succeeds the purchase, short sale precedes the purchase. Because the seller/borrower is generally required to make a cash deposit equivalent to the sale proceeds, it offers the lender some security.

===Naked shorts in the United States===

Naked short selling is a case of short selling without first arranging a borrow. If the stock is in short supply, finding shares to borrow can be difficult. The seller may also decide not to borrow the shares, in some cases because lenders are not available, or because the costs of lending are too high.  When shares are not borrowed within the clearing time period and the short-seller does not tender shares to the buyer, the trade is considered to have "[[failure to deliver|failed to deliver]]."&lt;ref name="fool"&gt;
{{Cite web
|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/high-growth/2005/03/24/the-naked-truth-on-illegal-shorting.aspx
|title=The Naked Truth on Illegal Shorting
|publisher=www.fool.com
|accessdate=2008-03-12
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the trade will continue to sit open or the buyer may be credited the shares by the [[Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation|DTCC]] until the short-seller either closes out the position or borrows the shares.&lt;ref name="WSJ_July2007"/&gt;

It is difficult to measure how often naked short selling occurs. Fails to deliver are not necessarily indicative of naked shorting, and can result from both "long" transactions (stock purchases) and short sales.&lt;ref name=KeyPoints/&gt;&lt;ref name='SECFails'/&gt;  Naked shorting can be invisible in a liquid market, as long as the short sale is eventually delivered to the buyer. However, if the covers are impossible to find, the trades fail. Fail reports are published regularly by the SEC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/foia/docs/failsdata.htm|title=SEC.gov -  Frequently Requested FOIA Document: Fails-to-Deliver Data|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a sudden rise in the number of fails-to-deliver will alert the SEC to the possibility of naked short selling. In some recent cases, it was claimed that the daily activity was larger than all of the available shares, which would normally be unlikely.&lt;ref name=fool/&gt;

====Extent of naked shorting====

The reasons for naked shorting, and the extent of it, had been disputed for several years before the SEC's 2008 action to prohibit the practice.  What is generally recognized is that naked [[shorting]] tends to happen when shares are difficult to borrow.  Studies have shown that naked [[short selling]] also increases with the cost of borrowing {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

In recent years,{{when|date=December 2014}} a number of companies{{which|date=December 2014}} have been accused{{by whom|date=January 2012}} of using naked shorts in aggressive efforts to drive down share prices, sometimes with no intention of ever delivering the shares.&lt;ref name=fool/&gt;  These claims argue that, at least in theory, the practice allows an unlimited number of shares to be sold short. A ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' editorial in July 2008 said that naked short selling "enables speculators to drive down a company's stock by offering an overwhelming number of shares for sale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/classified/realestate/news/la-ed-sec17-2008jul17,0,5572972.story |title=The SEC finally steps in; As other regulators hustle to address the economy, the Securities and Exchange Commission needs to better enforce laws already on its books |date=July 17, 2008 |work=Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEC has stated that naked shorting is sometimes falsely asserted as a reason for a share price decline, when, often, "the price decrease is a result of the company's poor financial situation rather than the reasons provided by the [[insider]]s or promoters."&lt;ref name=KeyPoints/&gt;

Before 2008, regulators had generally downplayed the extent of naked shorting in the US. At a [[North American Securities Administrators Association]] (NASAA) conference on naked short selling in November 2005, an official of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] stated that NYSE had not found evidence of widespread naked short selling. In 2006, an official of the SEC said that "While there may be instances of abusive short selling, 99% of all trades in dollar value settle on time without incident."&lt;ref name="dtcc2006sho"&gt;

|accessdate=2008-03-12
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Of all those that do not, 85% are resolved within 10 business days and 90% within 20.&lt;ref name="dtcc2006sho"/&gt; That means that about 1% of shares that change hands daily, or about $1 billion per day, are subject to delivery failures,&lt;ref name=WSJ_July2007/&gt; although the SEC has stated that "fails-to-deliver can occur for a number of reasons on both long and short sales," and accordingly that they do not necessarily indicate naked short selling.&lt;ref name=KeyPoints/&gt;&lt;ref name='SECFails'&gt;

|title=Fails-to-Deliver Data
|publisher=www.sec.gov
|accessdate=2008-03-12
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, SEC chairman [[Christopher Cox]] said that the SEC "has zero tolerance for abusive naked short-selling" while implementing new regulations to prohibit the practice, culminating in the September 2008 action following the failures of [[Bear Stearns]] and [[Lehman Brothers]] amidst speculation that naked short selling had played a contributory role.&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-204.htm "SEC Issues New Rules to Protect Investors Against Naked Short Selling Abuses"], Press release, Securities and Exchange Commission, September 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Cox said that "the rule would be designed to ensure transparency in short-selling in general, beyond the practice of naked short-selling."&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;

====Claimed effects of naked shorting====
{{quotation|The SEC is committed to maintaining orderly securities markets. The abusive practice of naked short selling is far different from ordinary short selling, which is a healthy and necessary part of a free market. Our agency’s rules are highly supportive of short selling, which can help quickly transmit price signals in response to negative information or prospects for a company. Short selling helps prevent “irrational exuberance” and bubbles. But when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market — it is undermining it. And in the context of a potential “distort and short” campaign aimed at an otherwise sound financial institution, this kind of manipulative activity can have drastic consequences.|Speech by SEC chairman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naked Short Selling Is One Problem a Slumping Market Shouldn't Have|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As with the prevalence of naked shorting, the effects are contested.  The SEC has stated that the practice can be beneficial in enhancing liquidity in difficult-to-borrow shares, while others have suggested that it adds efficiency to the securities lending market.  Critics of the practice argue that it is often used for [[market manipulation]], that it can damage companies and even that it threatens the broader markets.

One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books.  This has been alleged to create "phantom" or "counterfeit" shares, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and artificially depressing the share price. However, the SEC has disclaimed the existence of counterfeit shares and stated that naked short selling would not increase a company's outstanding shares.&lt;ref name=secfaq/&gt; Short seller [[David Rocker]] contended that failure to deliver securities "can be done for manipulative purposes to create the impression that the stock is a tight borrow," although he said that this should be seen as a failure to deliver "longs" rather than "shorts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Richard Fuld]], the former CEO of the financial firm Lehman Brothers, during hearings on the bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers and bailout of AIG before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform alleged that a host of factors including a crisis of confidence and naked short selling attacks followed by false rumors contributed to the collapse of both Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oversight.house.gov/story.asp?ID=2176 Committee to Hold Hearings on Collapse of Lehman Brothers and AIG], October 03, 2008 [http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20081006125839.pdf testimony of Richard Fuld] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826083809/http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20081006125839.pdf |date=2009-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuld had been obsessed with short sellers and had even demoted those Lehman executives that dealt with them; he claimed that the short sellers and the rumour mongers had brought down Lehman, although he had no evidence of it.&lt;ref name=vendetta /&gt; Upon the examination of the issue of whether "naked short selling" was in any way a cause of the collapse of Bear Stearns or Lehman, securities experts reached the conclusion that the alleged "naked short sales" occurred after the collapse and therefore played no role in it.

==Regulations in the United States==

===Securities Exchange Act of 1934===
The [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] stipulates a settlement period up to two business days before a stock needs to be delivered, generally referred to as "[[T+2]] delivery."

===Regulation SHO===
The SEC enacted Regulation SHO in January 2005 to target abusive naked short selling by reducing [[failure to deliver (finance)|failure to deliver]] securities, and by limiting the time in which a broker can permit failures to deliver.&lt;ref name="keypoints"&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/keyregshoissues.htm "Key Points About Regulation SHO"], Security and Exchange Commission&lt;/ref&gt; In addressing the first, it stated that a broker or dealer may not accept a short sale order without having first borrowed or identified the stock being sold.&lt;ref name="law.uc.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/regSHO/rule203.html|title=Securities Lawyer's Deskbook, Rule 203 |author=University of Cincinnati College of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule had the following exemptions:
#Broker or dealer accepting a short sale order from another registered broker or dealer
#Bona fide [[Market maker|market making]]
#Broker-dealer effecting a sale on behalf of a customer that is deemed to own the security pursuant to Rule 200&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/regSHO/rule200.html |title=Securities Lawyer's Deskbook, Rule 200 |author=University of Cincinnati College of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; through no fault of the customer or the broker-dealer.&lt;ref name="law.uc.edu"/&gt;

To reduce the duration for which fails to deliver are permitted to sit open, the regulation requires broker-dealers to close out open fail-to-deliver positions in threshold securities that have persisted for 13 consecutive settlement days.&lt;ref name="keypoints"/&gt; The SEC, in describing Regulation SHO, stated that failures to deliver shares that persist for an extended period of time "may result in large delivery obligations where stock settlement occurs."&lt;ref name="keypoints"/&gt;

Regulation SHO also created the "Threshold Security List", which reported any stock where more than 0.5% of a company's total outstanding shares failed delivery for five consecutive days. A number of companies have appeared on the list, including [[Krispy Kreme]], [[Martha Stewart Omnimedia]] and [[Delta Air Lines]]. The [[Motley Fool]], an investment website, observes that "when a stock appears on this list, it is like a red flag waving, stating 'something is wrong here!'"&lt;ref name=fool/&gt;  However, the SEC clarified that appearance on the threshold list "does not necessarily mean that there has been abusive naked short selling or any impermissible trading in the stock."&lt;ref name="keypoints"/&gt;

In July 2006, the SEC proposed to amend Regulation SHO, to further reduce failures to deliver securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2006/34-54154.pdf|format=PDF|author=United States Securities and Exchange Commission|title=Proposed SEC 17 CFR PART 242 (Release No. 34-54154; File No. S7-12-06) RIN 3235-AJ57 Amendments to Regulation SHO}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEC Chairman [[Christopher Cox]] referred to "the serious problem of abusive naked short sales, which can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price" and that the SEC is "concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to loopholes in Regulation SHO".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm|title=Opening Statements at the US Securities and Exchange Commission Open Meeting|date=July 12, 2006|author=Christopher Cox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developments, 2007 to the present===
In June 2007, the SEC voted to remove the [[grandfather clause|grandfather provision]] that allowed fails-to-deliver that existed before Reg SHO to be exempt from Reg SHO. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox called naked short selling "a fraud that the commission is bound to prevent and to punish." The SEC also said it was considering removing an exemption from the rule for options [[market maker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/business/14sec.html?ref=business |title=S.E.C. Ends Decades-Old Price Limits on Short Selling |author=Floyd Norris |work=The New York Times |date=June 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal of the grandfather provision and naked shorting restrictions generally have been endorsed by the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/|title=NASDAQ's Homepage for Retail Investors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, SEC Chairman [[Christopher Cox]] gave a speech entitled the "'Naked' Short Selling Anti-Fraud Rule," in which he announced new SEC efforts to combat naked short selling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/video0030408cc_short.wmv Video of [[Christopher Cox]]], March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Under the proposal, the SEC would create an antifraud rule targeting those who knowingly deceive brokers about having located securities before engaging in short sales, and who fail to deliver the securities by the delivery date.  Cox said the proposal would address concerns about short-selling abuses, particularly in the market for [[market capitalization|small-cap stocks]].  Even with the regulation in place, the SEC received hundreds of complaints in 2007 about alleged abuses involving short sales.  The SEC estimated that about 1% of shares that changed hands daily, about $1 billion, were subject to delivery failures.  SEC Commissioners Paul Atkins and Kathleen Casey expressed support for the crackdown.&lt;ref&gt;Judith A. Burns, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120468499197912561?mod=googlenews_wsj "SEC Proposes Teeth for Short-Selling Rules"], ''Wall Street Journal'', March 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/etfNews/idUSN0446331920080304 "SEC proposes tougher 'naked' short selling rules"], March 4, 2008, ''Reuters''&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-July 2008, the SEC announced emergency actions to limit the naked short selling of [[government sponsored enterprise]]s (GSEs), such as [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]], in an effort to limit market volatility of financial stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aQRBietUNVyw|last=Westbrook|first=Jesse|title=SEC to Limit Short Sales of Fannie, Freddie, Brokers|date=July 15, 2008|accessdate=2008-07-15|publisher=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even with respect to those stocks the SEC soon thereafter announced there would be an exception with regard to market makers.&lt;ref name="Ivy"&gt;Ivy Schmerken, [http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/advancedtrading/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=209101993&amp;cid=RSSfeed_WST_News "SEC Short Sale Rule Could Create a Bubble in Financial Stocks"], ''Wall Street &amp; Technology'', July 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; SEC Chairman Cox noted that the emergency order was "not a response to unbridled naked short selling in financial issues", saying that "that has not occurred". Cox said, "rather it is intended as a preventative step to help restore market confidence at a time when it is sorely needed."&lt;ref name='Cox-preventive'&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm |title=Public Statement by SEC Chairman: Naked Short Selling Is One Problem a Slumping Market Shouldn't Have |accessdate=2009-08-23 |last=Cox |first=Christopher |date=2008-07-18 |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts warned of the potential for the creation of price bubbles.&lt;ref name="Ivy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;refer=columnist_antilla&amp;sid=al7ADyiLbmAE |title=Short Sellers in Stock Cop's Sights |author=Susan Antilla |date=August 1, 2008 |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the new rules is that market makers are no longer given an exception. As a result, options market makers will be treated in the same way as all other market participants, and effectively will be banned from naked short selling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-204.htm "SEC Issues New Rules to Protect Investors Against Naked Short Selling Abuses"], Securities and Exchange Commission, September 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, 2008, voters in South Dakota considered a ballot initiative, "The South Dakota Small Investor Protection Act", to end naked short selling in that state.  The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association of Washington and New York said they would take legal action if the measure passed.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Hansard, [http://www.investmentnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081102/REG/311039962/1027/HEDGEFUNDS "SIFMA to sue if short-sale vote wins;  Naked short selling on South Dakota ballot], ''InvestmentNews'', November 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The voters defeated the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.investmentnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081105/REG/811059981 |title= Naked short-selling ban nixed in S.

In July 2009, the SEC, under what the Wall Street Journal described as "intense political pressure," made permanent an interim rule that obliges brokerages to promptly buy or borrow securities when executing a short sale.&lt;ref name='WSJ7-27'&gt;{{cite news | first=Sarah N. | last=Lynch | title=SEC to Limit 'Naked' Short-Selling | date=2009-07-27 | publisher= | url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124871727822084391 | work =The Wall Street Journal | pages = | accessdate = 2009-07-27 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC said that since the fall of 2008, abusive naked short selling had been reduced by 50%, and the number of threshold list securities (equity securities with too many "fails to deliver") declined from 582 in July 2008 to 63 in March 2009.&lt;ref name='SEC7-09'&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-172.htm |title=SEC Takes Steps to Curtail Abusive Short Sales and Increase Market Transparency |accessdate=2009-07-28 |date=2009-07-24 |work=Securities and Exchange Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='BBC'&gt;{{cite news|first=BBC |last=News |title=US rules on abusive short selling |work=bbc.co.uk |pages= |accessdate=2009-07-27 |publisher= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8171667.stm; |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731163151/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8171667.stm |archivedate=July 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Mary Schapiro, chairperson of the SEC, testified before the U.S. Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that fails to deliver in equity securities had declined 63.4 percent, while persistent and large fails had declined 80.5 percent.&lt;ref name="Schapiro testimony"/&gt;

The [[Singapore Exchange]] started to penalize naked short sales with an interim measure in September, 2008. These initial penalties started at $100 per day. In November, they announced plans to increase the fines for failing to complete trades. The new penalties would penalize traders who fail to cover their positions, starting at $1,000 per day. There would also be fines for brokerages who fail to use the exchange's buying-in market to cover their positions, starting at $5,000 per day.

==Regulatory enforcement actions==
In 2005, the SEC notified [[Refco]] of intent to file an enforcement action against the securities unit of Refco for securities trading violations concerning the shorting of Sedona stock. The SEC sought information related to two former Refco brokers who handled the account of a client, Amro International, which shorted Sedona's stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/10/20/news/midcaps/refco/index.htm |title=More woes for Refco, execs: Newspapers say creditors eye over $1B insiders made from stock, while SEC probes "naked shorting"|date=October 20, 2005|publisher=CNN/Money | accessdate=May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; No charges had been filed by 2007.

In December 2006, the SEC sued Gryphon Partners, a [[hedge fund]], for [[insider trading]] and naked short-selling involving PIPEs in the unregistered stock of 35 companies. PIPEs are "private investments in public equities," used by companies to raise cash. The naked shorting took place in Canada, where it was legal at the time.

In March 2007, [[Goldman Sachs]] was fined $2 million by the SEC for allowing customers to illegally sell shares short prior to secondary public offerings.

In October 2007, the SEC settled charges against New York hedge fund adviser Sandell Asset Management Corp. and three executives of the firm for, among other things, shorting stock without locating shares to borrow. Fines totalling $8 million were imposed, and the firm neither admitted nor denied the charges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2007/2007-216.htm "SEC Charges New York Hedge Fund Adviser With Short Sale Violations in Connection With Hibernia-Capital One Merger"], SEC Press Release, October 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008 Lehman Brothers Inc. was fined $250,000 by the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA) for failing to properly document the ownership of short sales as they occurred, and for failing to annotate an affirmative declaration that shares would be available by the settlement date.&lt;ref&gt;Heidi N.

In April 2010 Goldman Sachs paid $450,000 to settle the SEC's allegations that it had failed to deliver "approximatedly" (sic) 86 short sells between early December 2008 and mid-January 2009, and that it had failed to institute adequate controls to prevent the failures. The company neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;Marcy Gordon (AP), [https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/banking/2010-05-04-goldman-sachs-short-selling_N.htm Goldman Sachs settles short-sales allegations], ''USA Today'', 5 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, lawyers acting for Goldman accidentally released an unredacted document revealing compromising internal discussions regarding naked short selling. e.g. "Fuck the compliance area – procedures, schmecedures,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/taibblog/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-20120515|title=Tabbi: Goldman and 'Naked Short Selling'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation and DTCC==
The [[Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation]] (DTCC) has been criticized by the Wall Street Journal for its approach to naked short selling.&lt;ref name=WSJ_July2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtcc.com/news/press/releases/2007/wsj_response.php?lpos=3&amp;lid=3 "DTCC response to Wall Street Journal Article"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302054831/http://www.dtcc.com/news/press/releases/2007/wsj_response.php?lpos=3&amp;lid=3 |date=2009-03-02 }}, Press release, July 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 
DTCC has been sued with regard to its alleged participation in naked short selling, and the issue of DTCC's possible involvement has been taken up by Senator [[Robert Foster Bennett|Robert Bennett]] and discussed by the NASAA and in articles in the [[Wall Street Journal]] and [[Euromoney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euromoney.com/Article/1001047/Naked-shorting-The-curious-incident-of-the-shares-that-didnt-.html "Naked shorting: The curious incident of the shares that didn't exist"], April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, Senator Bennett suggested on the [[U.S. Senate]] floor that the allegations involving DTCC and naked short selling are "serious enough" that there should be a hearing on them with DTCC officials by the [[Senate Banking Committee]], and that banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd has expressed a willingness to hold such a hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bennett.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=279519 "Senator Bennett Discusses Naked Short Selling on the Senate Floor"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227192527/http://bennett.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=279519 |date=2008-02-27 }}, website of Senator Bennett, July 20, 2007, accessed 2009-02-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics also contend DTCC has been too secretive with information about where naked shorting is taking place.&lt;ref name=WSJ_July2007/&gt; Ten suits concerning naked short-selling filed against the DTCC were withdrawn or dismissed by May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Nevada Court Dismisses Nanopierce Lawsuit Against DTCC On Naked Short Selling |publisher=Depository Trust Clearing Corporation |url=http://www.dtcc.com/Publications/dtcc/may05/nanopierce.html |date=May 2005 |accessdate=2007-02-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061207091029/http://www.dtcc.com/Publications/dtcc/may05/nanopierce.html |archivedate = December 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two separate lawsuits, filed in 2006 and 2007 by [[NovaStar Financial, Inc.]] shareholders and [[Overstock.com]], named as defendants ten Wall Street prime brokers.

A suit against DTCC by Pet Quarters Inc. was dismissed by a federal court in Arkansas, and upheld by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''Pet Quarters, Inc. v. Depository Trust and Clearing Corp.''
--- F.3d ----, 2009 WL 579270 C.A.8 (Ark.),2009.&lt;/ref&gt;   Pet Quarters alleged the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp.'s stock-borrow program resulted in the creation of nonexistent or [[phantom stock]] and contributed to the illegal short selling of the company's shares. The court ruled:   "In short, all the damages that Pet Quarters claims to have suffered stem from activities performed or statements made by the defendants in conformity with the program's Commission approved rules. We conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing the complaint on the basis of preemption." Pet Quarters' complaint was almost identical to suits against DTCC brought by Whistler Investments Inc. and Nanopierce Technologies Inc. The suits also challenged DTCC's stock-borrow program, and were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;"Court Rules Against Company Claiming Illegal Short Selling" by Carol Remond, Dow Jones News Service, March 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
A study of trading in initial public offerings by two SEC staff economists, published in April 2007, found that excessive numbers of fails to deliver were not correlated with naked short selling. The authors of the study said that while the findings in the paper specifically concern IPO trading, "The results presented in this paper also inform a public debate surrounding the role of short selling and fails to deliver in price formation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|ssrn=981242 |title=Short Selling and Failures to Deliver in Initial Public Offerings |author1=Amy K. Edwards  |author2=Kathleen Weiss Hanley |lastauthoramp=yes |date=April 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a study by Leslie Boni in 2004 found correlation between "strategic delivery failures" and the cost of borrowing shares.  The paper, which looked at a "unique dataset of the
entire cross-section of U.S. equities," credited the initial recognition of strategic delivery fails to Richard Evans, Chris Geczy, David Musto and Adam Reed, and found its review to provide evidence consistent with their hypothesis that "market makers strategically fail to deliver shares when borrowing costs are high." A recent study by Autore, Boulton, and Braga-Alves examines stock returns around delivery failures between 2005 and 2008 and finds evidence consistent with a positive link between delivery failures and borrowing costs.

An April 2007 study conducted for Canadian market regulators by Market Regulation Services Inc. found that fails to deliver securities were not a significant problem on the Canadian market, that "less than 6% of fails resulting from the sale of a security involved short sales" and that "fails involving short sales are projected to account for only 0.07% of total short sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://investmentexecutive.com/client/en/News/DetailNews.asp?Id=38819&amp;cat=8&amp;IdSection=8&amp;PageMem=&amp;nbNews=&amp;IdPub=|title=No evidence of excessive failed trades on Canadian marketplaces: study |author=James Langton|work=Investment Executive|date=April 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Government Accountability Office study, released in June 2009, found that recent SEC rules had apparently reduced abusive short selling, but that the SEC needed to give clearer guidance to the brokerage industry.&lt;ref name='AP-6-3-09'&gt;{{cite news | first=Marcy | last=Gordon | title=Guidance on short-selling needed: GAO | date=2009-06-03 | publisher= | work =Associated Press | pages = | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]], appointed by Congress to investigate the 2008 financial crisis, makes no reference to naked shorting, or short-selling of financial stocks, in its conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;http://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-reports/fcic_final_report_conclusions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of fails to deliver, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2014, found no evidence that FTDs "caused price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis." Researchers studied 1,492 New York Stock Exchange stocks over a 42-month period from 2005 to 2008, and found that "greater FTDs lead to higher liquidity and pricing efficiency, and their impact is similar to our estimate of delivered short sales."&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
Some journalists have expressed concern about naked short selling, while others contend that naked short selling is not harmful and that its prevalence has been exaggerated by corporate officials seeking to blame external forces for internal problems with their companies.&lt;ref name="nudists"&gt;

Reviewing the SEC's July 2008 emergency order, ''[[Barron's Magazine|Barron's]]'' said in an editorial: "Rather than fixing any of the real problems with the agency and its mission, Cox and his fellow commissioners waved a newspaper and swatted the imaginary fly of naked short-selling.

The Wall Street Journal said in an editorial in July 2008 that "the Beltway is shooting the messenger by questioning the price-setting mechanisms for barrels of oil and shares of stock." But it said the emergency order to bar naked short selling "won't do much harm," and said "Critics might say it's a solution to a nonproblem, but the SEC doesn't claim to be solving a problem. The Commission's move is intended to prevent even the possibility that an unscrupulous short seller could drive down the shares of a financial firm with a flood of sell orders that aren't backed by an actual ability to deliver the shares to buyers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121633656801263789?mod=opinion_main_review_and_outlooks | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Who's Partying Naked? | date=July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in March 2009 Bloomberg News Service said that the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy may have been prevented by curbs on naked shorting.

In May 2009, the New York Times's chief financial correspondent [[Floyd Norris]] reported that naked shorting is "almost gone." He said that delivery failures, where they occur, are quickly corrected.&lt;ref name='Norris5-1-09'&gt;{{cite news | first=Floyd | last=Norris |authorlink= Floyd Norris | title=Goodbye to Naked Shorting | date=2009-05-01 | publisher= | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/01/business/economy/01norris.html | work =The New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2009-05-01 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published in October 2009, [[Rolling Stone]] writer [[Matt Taibbi]] contended that [[Bear Stearns]] and [[Lehman Brothers]] were flooded with "counterfeit stock" that helped kill both companies.

'''Naomi Sagara''' ({{lang-ja|佐良直美}} born 1945) is the stage name of '''Yamaguchi Nayuko''', an award-winning Japanese popular singer who was prolific between 1967 and 1980. She won numerous awards as a singer and composer, branching into acting. After a surgery to remove [[Vocal cord nodule|polyps on her vocal chords]] in 1985, she became a business woman. Since 1993, she has worked in the field of animal welfare and has published several books about animal care. She has periodically returned to television in guest appearances and in 2010 resumed singing and composing.

==Early life==
Sagara was born in 1945 &lt;!-- 10 January 1945 --&gt; in Tokyo. She suffered from severe shyness from childhood, but had a love for music. Raised in a wealthy family, her grandfather is the major shareholder of Tomoe Industries, she began music training with jazz singer {{ill|Sanae Mizushima|ja|水島早苗}} at the age of sixteen. She enrolled in [[Nihon University]] College of Arts to study television direction and originally wanted to produce music programming for [[Fuji TV]]. While she was in university, she continued singing at such venues as Nikko Music Salon mainly to gain an understanding of the performer's perspective. When she graduated in 1967, Fuji was not interested in hiring a woman producer, but she was approached by a scout from [[JVC|The Japan Victor Company]] who was looking for new singing talent.{{sfn|''Tokyo Sports''|2010}}

==Career==
Sagara debuted as a singer with the song ''The World for Two People'' ({{lang-ja|世界は二人のために}}), which won her the Best New Artists Prize at the 9th [[Japan Record Awards]] in 1967 and sold 1.2 million copies.{{sfn|''Tokyo Sports''|2010}} She became known for her distinctive style and had many hits throughout the country.{{sfn|Law|2014|p=143}} In 1969, she won the grand prize for ''If It Is Happy, If It Is Sad'' ({{lang-ja|いいじゃないの幸せならば}}) at the [[11th Japan Record Awards]], presented by the [[Japan Composer's Association]] for best new record and performer. The win marked the first time the top honors had gone to a woman.{{sfn|Japan Composer's Association|1969}} Beginning in 1967, Sagara was invited to sing at the [[Kōhaku Uta Gassen|Year-end Song Festival]], known as "Kōhaku", hosted by the [[Japan Broadcasting Corporation]] ({{lang-ja|Nippon Hōsō Kyōkai, NHK}}). For thirteen consecutive years, she participated and placed in the finals for the competition five times.{{sfn|Zaikei Shimbun|2016}}{{sfn|Red and White Record|2017}} In 1972, she won the annual singing battle and repeated her win in 1974 and 1976.{{sfn|''Nikkan Sports''|2012}}

Her music career led Sagara into acting, as she composed the theme song for the television drama ''Arigatou'' (Thank you), which aired from 1970 to 1974.{{sfn|''Oricon News''|2011}} She was a featured actress in the final season of the program.{{sfn|Sekiguchi|2011}}{{sfn|Clements|Tamamuro|2003|p=311}} In 1977, the mayor of [[Hiroshima]], the Chamber of Commerce, and executives of the Hiroshima Bank organized a festival underwritten by the ''[[Chugoku Shimbun]]'' and [[RCC Broadcasting]] in honor of the resilience of the citizens in surviving the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing]] and celebrating peace and the joy of living. Sagara was selected as the featured singer for the inaugural [[Hiroshima Flower Festival]], and sang the theme song, ''Hanaguruma''.{{sfn|Yamamoto|2012}}

In 1980, a woman claiming to be Sagara's former partner [[Outing|outed]] her as a lesbian on [[TV Asahi]]'s ''Afternoon Show'', causing the collapse of her career.{{sfn|Larkin|2006}}{{sfn|Law|2014|p=143}}{{sfn|''Daily Shincho''|2016}} Sagara denied the alleged affair and the woman retracted her statement, but the damage was done, as invitations to the premier award shows disappeared.{{sfn|''Daily Shincho''|2016}} She did continue to work in music for a few years, releasing a single ''歌手活動では'' (Yasuko case) in 1983{{sfn|''Oricon News''|2011}} and then a jazz album to honor her former teacher Mizushima in 1986. After completing the album, Sagara lost interest in her music career. The following year, she had surgery to remove polyps on her vocal chords. She was told that after the surgery she would be unable to sing for a year. Sagara took a 9 to 5 job in her family business.{{sfn|''Tokyo Sports''|2010}} 

Wanting to work with animals, Sagara began a company, Animal Fanciers's Club, in 1993, in [[Nasushiobara]] in the [[Tochigi Prefecture]]. Her focus is on rescuing dogs and cats and improving animal welfare.{{sfn|''Tokyo Sports''|2010}}{{sfn|Zaikei Shimbun|2016}} At the facility, she trains dogs and does outreach, inviting internationally known lecturers to educate the public about proper care of animals.{{sfn|Zaikei Shimbun|2016}} Since 2003, she has published books dealing with animal care.{{sfn|Books Kinokuniya|2003}} In 2010, after two decades away from the music industry, Sagara released an album, ''いのちの木陰'' (Shades of Life).{{sfn|Sekiguchi|2011}} After hearing the song, she was selected in 2011 to compose and sing the theme song for the TBS series ''Izakaya Henji''.{{sfn|''Oricon News''|2011}}{{sfn|Sekiguchi|2011}}

'''Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information (NNPI)''' is a category of [[intellectual capital]] defined by the [[United States Navy]] to be "classified or unclassified information concerning the design, arrangement, development, manufacture, testing, operation, administration, training, maintenance, and repair of the propulsion plants of naval nuclear-powered ships and prototypes, including the associated shipboard and shore-based nuclear support facilities.." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://doni.daps.dla.mil/Directives/09000%20General%20Ship%20Design%20and%20Support/09-200%20Propulsion%20Plants%20Support/N9210.3%20(Unclas%20Portion).pdf
|title=OPNAVINST N9210.3, SAFEGUARDING OF NAVAL NUCLEAR PROPULSION INFORMATION (NNPI), 6/7/2010, Unclassified Portion, page 1-1, Definition|accessdate=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all NNPI is [[classified information]].  While most NNPI is sensitive, the Navy recognizes that the public has an interest in [[Natural environment|environmental]], [[safety]], and [[health]] information, and that the basic [[research]] carried out by the Navy can be useful to [[industry]].  Unclassified information is therefore marked with the acronym "U-NNPI", but is still restricted as [[wikt:NOFORN|NOFORN]].&lt;ref&gt;See OPNAVINST N9210.3, esp. Chapters 3 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

NNPI is explicitly protected information and is not released to the general public without authority.  Those who release even NNPI-U without authority may be administratively punished, and even [[criminal law|criminally]] in the case of NNPI-C.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  NNPI is restricted from disclosure under the Arms Export Control Act, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2778 22 USC §§2778] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2794 2794(7)]; such information is listed in the [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=d148ef6a9390b1e27fc09865c734666c;rgn=div5;view=text;node=22%3A1.0.1.13.60;idno=22;cc=ecfr US Munitions List, 22 CFR §121.1], Category VI, paragraph (g).  

In some instances, small events that would normally be reported as "Events" or LOC (Loss of Control) to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] from other licensees can be classified as NNPI-C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://azstarnet.com/news/national/dangerous-tennessee-radioactive-spill-kept-from-public-papers-sealed/article_70fed1e3-e100-5f8e-91b6-4535b39289d6.html
|title=Dangerous Tennessee radioactive spill kept from public; papers sealed 
|author=Associated Press

|date=2007-08-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This designation differs for similar "events" that occur on a secret network, which are referred to as "spillage".

The '''North American Meat Processors Association''' (NAMP) was an [[industry trade group|industry group]] for [[meat industry|meat]] processors, packers, and distributors. It was a [[nonprofit]], membership-based group with significant presence in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean.  Its Executive Director was Phil Kimball.  The Executive Committee included John DeBenedetti, Chairman of Del Monte Meat Company (U.S.); Brent Cator, President of Cardinal Meat Specialists. Ltd (Canada); Mark Shuket, Vice President of Old World Provisions (U.S.); Michael Strauss, Treasurer of Colorado Boxed Beef Company (U.S.) and Gary Malenke, Assistant Treasurer of Sioux-Preme Pork Products (U.S.).

NAMP is now merged into the [[North American Meat Institute]] (NAMI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2014/12/birth-being-given-thru-merger-of-new-powerful-meat-group/#.VqyUDrxlk6g|title=Merger of Two Meat Industry Associations Takes Effect Jan. 1|work=[[Food Safety News]]|date=18 December 2014|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-10-13/news/ct-met-1014-obituary-hatoff-2-20121013_1_gene-georgetti-steaks-todd-hatoff|title=Robert A.

NAMP was concerned with meat industry issues including nutrition, safety and hygiene, government and regulatory affairs, and standardization. It sponsors an annual convention, an annual business conference, regional meetings, and training programs. It was founded in 1942 and was headquartered in [[Reston, Virginia]]. 

Primary membership was limited to firms actively involved in processing meat, including [[poultry]], [[seafood]], and [[game (food)|game]]. Associate membership was available to suppliers to meat processors. 

NAMP was best known, however, for ''The Meat Buyer's Guide'', intended for [[butchers]] and commercial meat purchasers, which was a recognized reference for cutting and grading meat. It was published annually. NAMP maintains a standard numbering system for cuts of meat.

{{update|date=November 2010}}

The '''Panel on Takeovers and Mergers''' (the '''Takeover Panel''' or '''PTM''') is a regulatory body located in [[London]], [[England]].  It was set up in 1968 and is charged with the administration of the [[City Code on Takeovers and Mergers]].  Its role is to ensure that all [[shareholder]]s are treated equally during takeover bids. Its main functions are to issue and administer the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the "Code") and to supervise and regulate takeovers and other matters to which the Code applies. Its central objective is to ensure fair treatment for all shareholders in takeover bids.

== Powers ==

The Panel is a statutory body under Chapter 1 of Part 28 (sections 942 to 965) of the Companies Act 2006 as amended by The Companies Act 2006 (Amendment of Schedule 2)(No 2) Order 2009. It has established a reputation for giving informed advice in an expert area of regulatory activity.  It is the ''de facto'' arbiter of takeover bids and has the support of government and other organisations with statutory involvement.

The European Takeovers Directive mandates that the Panel is put on a statutory footing. This was completed in the [[Companies Act 2006]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/eur-lex/pri/en/oj/dat/2004/l_142/l_14220040430en00120023.pdf European Takeovers Directive]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whenever a transaction is made on the [[London Stock Exchange|LSE]] or other London-based [[Stock exchange|exchange]] that is greater than £10,000, the details of the transaction are passed on to the panel for their evaluation, and a levy is charged of (currently) £1.00 on the transaction, which goes to the panel as payment (known as the "PTM levy").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londonstockexchange.com/traders-and-brokers/rules-regulations/change-and-updates/stock-exchange-notices/2007/notification-ptmlevy.pdf PTM Levy - London Stock Exchange]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was decided in ''[[R v Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, ex p Datafin plc]]'' that decisions of this panel are subject to judicial review, even though it is only a private body. This was due to its "enormous power" and "giant's strength".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= R v Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, ex parte Datafin plc|vol= &amp;#91;1986&amp;#93;|reporter= AppLR|opinion= 12/05|pinpoint= |court= CA|date= 5 December 1986|url= http://www.nadr.co.uk/articles/published/ArbitrationOlderReports/Data%20Fin%201986.pdf|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As The Panel is now a statutory footing, its decisions can now be reviewed even without referring to this case.

'''Peter Carl Fabergé''', also known as '''Karl Gustavovich Fabergé''' ({{lang-ru|Карл Гу́ставович Фаберже́}}, ''Karl Gustavovich Faberzhe''; 30 May 1846 – 24 September 1920), was a Russian [[jewellery|jeweller]] best known for the famous [[Fabergé egg]]s made in the style of genuine [[Easter egg]]s, but using [[precious metal]]s and [[gemstone]]s rather than more mundane materials. He's the founder of the famous jewelry legacy [[House of Fabergé]].

==Early life==
[[File:Augusta Faberge.jpg|thumb|upright|Augusta Julia Jacobs Faberge]]
He was born in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia, to the [[Baltic German]] jeweller [[Gustav Fabergé]] and his [[Danish people|Danish]] wife Charlotte Jungstedt. Gustav Fabergé's paternal ancestors were [[Huguenot]]s, originally from [[La Bouteille]], [[Picardy]], who fled from France after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau|revocation of the Edict of Nantes]], first to Germany near [[Berlin]], then in 1800 to the [[Pernau]] (today [[Pärnu]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://faberge-museum.de/show.php?news&amp;nid=22 Fabergé Museum: Fabergé, sa famille et le développement de son entreprise] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325042052/http://faberge-museum.de/show.php?news&amp;nid=22 |date=2014-03-25 }}, faberge-museum.de&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baltic provinces|Baltic]] province of [[Livonia]], then part of Russia.

Until he was 14 years old he went to the German St Anne School in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia.{{cn|date=June 2018}} In 1860 his father retired from his jewelry business and moved with his family to [[Germany]]. He left the [[House of Fabergé]] in Saint Petersburg in the hands of his business partner. Carl Fabergé undertook a course at the [[Dresden]] Arts and Crafts School. 1862 [[Agathon Fabergé]], the Fabergés' second son, was born in [[Dresden]], Germany, where he went to school as well.

In 1864, Peter Carl Fabergé embarked upon a [[Grand Tour]] of [[Europe]] at . He received tuition from respected goldsmiths in Germany, France and England, attended a course at Schloss's Commercial College in [[Paris]], and viewed the objects in the galleries of Europe's leading museums.

His travel and study continued until 1872, when at the age of 26 he returned to St. Petersburg and married Augusta Julia Jacobs. 1874 saw the arrival of his first child, [[Eugene Fabergé]] and two years later, [[Agathon Fabergé]] was born; [[Alexander Fabergé]] and [[Nicholas Fabergé]] followed in 1877 and 1884 respectively.For the following 10 years, his father's trusted workmaster Hiskias Pendin acted as his mentor and tutor. The company was also involved with cataloguing, repairing, and restoring objects in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] during the 1870s. In 1881 the business moved to larger street-level premises at 16/18 Bolshaya Morskaya.

==Taking over the family business==
[[File:Karl Faberge.jpg|thumb|Peter Carl Faberge at work]]
Upon the death of Hiskias Pendin in 1882, Carl Fabergé took sole responsibility for running the company. Carl was awarded the title Master Goldsmith, which permitted him to use his own hallmark in addition to that of the firm. in 1885 his brother [[Agathon Fabergé]] joined the firm and became Carl Faberge's main assistant in the designing of jewelry. Agathon who had also [[Dresden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saint-petersburg.com/german/peter-carl-faberge/Peter Carl Faberge]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl and [[Agathon Fabergé Sr.]] were a sensation at the Pan-Russian Exhibition held in [[Moscow]] in 1882. Carl was awarded a gold medal and the [[St. Stanisias Medal]]. One of the Fabergé pieces displayed was a replica of a 4th-century BC gold bangle from the Scythian Treasure in the Hermitage. The Tsar, [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], "Emperor and Autocrat of all the Russians", declared that he could not distinguish the Fabergé's work from the original and ordered that objects by the [[House of Fabergé]] should be displayed in the Hermitage as examples of superb contemporary Russian craftsmanship. The House of Fabergé with its range of jewels was now within the focus of Russia's Imperial Court.

When Peter Carl took over the House, there was a move from producing jewellery in the then-fashionable French 18th century style to becoming artist-jewellers. 
Fabergé's production of the very first so-called [[Fabergé egg]], the [[First Hen Egg|Hen Egg]],  given as a gift from the Tsar to his wife [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Fyodorovna]] on Orthodox Easter (24 March) of 1885 so delighted her that on 1 May the Emperor assigned Fabergé the title ''Goldsmith by special appointment to the Imperial Crown'' of that year. This meant that Fabergé now had full personal access to the important [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] Collection, where he was able to study and find inspiration for developing his unique personal style. Influenced by the jewelled bouquets created by the eighteenth century goldsmiths [[Jean-Jacques Duval]] and [[Jérémie Pauzié]], Fabergé re-worked their ideas combining them with his accurate observations and his fascination for Japanese art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macdougallauction.com/Indexx1113.asp?id=249&amp;lx=a|title=Faberge's Wild Cherry Study|website=www.macdougallauction.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518081057/http://www.macdougallauction.com/Indexx1113.asp?id=249&amp;lx=a|archivedate=2015-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This resulted in a revival of the lost art of [[enameling]] and a focus on the setting of every single gemstone in a piece to its best visual advantage. Indeed, it was not unusual for Agathon to make ten or more wax models so that all possibilities could be exhausted before deciding on a final design. Shortly after Agathon joined the firm, the House introduced ''objects deluxe'': gold bejewelled items embellished with enamel ranging from electric bell pushes to cigarette cases and including ''objects de fantaisie''.

==Easter eggs==
{{Main article|Fabergé egg}}
[[File:Kuz most 26.jpg|thumb|House of Faberge in Moscow ([[Kuznetsky Most]] 4), 1893]]
In light of the Empress' response to receiving one of Fabergé's eggs on Easter, the Tsar soon commissioned the company to make an Easter egg as a gift for her every year thereafter. The Tsar placed an order for another egg the following year. Beginning in 1887, the Tsar apparently gave Carl Fabergé complete freedom with regard to egg designs, which then became more and more elaborate. According to Fabergé Family tradition, not even the Tsar knew what form they would take— the only stipulation was that each one should be unique and each should contain a surprise.  Upon the death of Alexander III, his son, the next Tsar, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], followed this tradition and expanded it by requesting that there be two eggs each year, one for his mother (who was eventually given a total of 30 such eggs) and one for his wife, [[Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse|Alexandra]] (who received another 20).  These Easter gift eggs are today distinguished from the other jeweled eggs Fabergé ended up producing by their designation as "Imperial Easter eggs" or "Tsar Imperial Easter eggs". The tradition continued until the [[October Revolution]] when the entire Romanov dynasty was executed and the eggs and many other treasures were confiscated by the interim government.  The two final eggs were never delivered nor paid for.

Although today the House of Fabergé is famed for its Imperial Easter eggs, it made many more objects ranging from silver tableware to fine jewelry which were also of exceptional quality and beauty, and until its departure from Russia during the revolution, Fabergé's company became the largest jewelry business in the country. In addition to its [[Saint Petersburg]] headquarters, it had branches in [[Moscow]], [[Odessa]], [[Kiev]] and [[London]]. It produced some 150,000 to 200,000 objects from 1882 until 1917.

In 1900, Fabergé's work represented Russia at the [[1900 World's Fair]] in [[Paris]]. As Carl Fabergé was a member of the jury, the House of Fabergé exhibited ''hors concours'' (without competing). Nevertheless, the House was awarded a gold medal and the city's jewelers recognized Carl Fabergé as a maître. Additionally, France recognized Carl Fabergé with one of the most prestigious of French awards, appointing him a knight of the Legion of Honour. Two of Carl's sons and his head workmaster were also honored. Commercially, the exposition was a great success and the firm acquired a great many orders and clients.

==Stock, Russian Revolution and nationalisation==
In 1916, the House of Fabergé became a joint-stock company with a capital of 3-million rubles.

The following year upon the outbreak of the [[October Revolution]], the business was taken over by a 'Committee of the Employees of the Company K Fabergé. In 1918 The House of Fabergé was nationalised by the [[Bolsheviks]]. In early October the stock was confiscated. The House of Fabergé was no more. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

After the [[nationalisation]] of the business, Carl Fabergé left St. Petersburg on the last [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] train for [[Riga]]. In mid-November, the Revolution having reached [[Latvia]], he fled to Germany and first settled in [[Bad Homburg]] and then in [[Wiesbaden]]. Eugène, the Fabergés' eldest, travelled with his mother in darkness by sleigh and on foot through snow-covered woods and reached [[Finland]] in December 1918. During June 1920, Eugène reached Wiesbaden and accompanied his father to [[Switzerland]] where other members of the family had taken refuge at the Bellevue Hotel in [[Pully]], near [[Lausanne]].

Peter Carl Fabergé never recovered from the shock of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} He died in Switzerland on September 24, 1920. His family believed he died of a broken heart. &lt;ref&gt;The Genius of Carl Faberge, Episode Two, 25 August 2018 BBC World News&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Augusta, died in 1925. The two were reunited in 1929 when Eugène Fabergé took his father's ashes from [[Lausanne]] and buried them in his mother's grave at the [[Cimetière du Grand Jas]] in [[Cannes]], France.

Fabergé had four sons: [[Eugène Fabergé|Eugène]] (1874–1960), [[Agathon Fabergé|Agathon]] (1876–1951), [[Alexander Fabergé|Alexander]] (1877–1952) and [[Nikolai Fabergé|Nicholas]] (1884–1939).  Descendants of Peter Carl Fabergé live in mainland Europe, Scandinavia and South America.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Personal life==
Henry Bainbridge, a manager of the London branch of the House of Fabergé, recorded recollections of his meetings with his employer in both his autobiography&lt;ref&gt;''Twice Seven: The Autobiography of H C Bainbridge'' (Routledge, London, 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; and the book he wrote about Fabergé.&lt;ref&gt;''Fabergé: Goldsmith and Jeweller to the Imperial Court – His Life and Work'' (Batsford, London, 1949)&lt;/ref&gt; We are also given an insight into the man from the recollections of François Birbaum, Fabergé's senior master craftsman from 1893 until the House's demise.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of the House of Fabergé according to the recollections of the senior master craftsman of the firm Franz P. Birbaum'' This was handwritten in 1919 at the request (or order) of the Soviet authorities. It added considerably to the knowledge of how the House of Fabergé operated. The English translation was published by Tatiana F Fabergé (great-granddaughter of Peter Carl Fabergé) and Valentin V. Skurlov in St. Petersburg in 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Bainbridge we know that while punctilious with his dress, Fabergé "rarely if ever wore black but favoured well-cut tweeds". He added "There was an air of the country gentleman about him, at times he reminded one of an immaculate gamekeeper with large pockets." He was a very focused individual with no wasted actions or speech. He did not like small talk. On one occasion during dinner Bainbridge, feeling out of the conversation said, "I see Lord Swaythingly is dead". Fabergé asked who he was and upon being told responded cuttingly, "And what can I do with a dead banker?"

When taking orders from customers he was always in a hurry and would soon forget the fine detail. He would then interrogate the staff so as to find any who had been standing near him and may have overheard. His great-granddaughter Tatiana Fabergé notes that he usually had a knotted handkerchief in his breast pocket.

When Carl noticed an unsuccessfully wrought item, he would call for his senior master craftsman and make endless derisory and ironic remarks. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} On occasions when Birbaum realized Fabergé was the designer, he would show him his sketch. Fabergé would then smile guiltily and say, "Since there is nobody to scold me, I have had to do it myself".

From Birbaum we also know that Carl was famous for his wit and was quite merciless to [[fop]]s, whom he hated. A certain prince who fell into this category boasted to Fabergé about his latest honour from the Tsar, adding that he had no idea as to why the award was made. The prince expected the jeweler to shower him with congratulations. Instead, Fabergé simply replied, "Indeed, your Highness, I too have no idea what for".

Carl never traveled with luggage—he bought all his requisites at his destination. On one occasion, when he arrived at the Negresco Hotel in Nice the doorman barred him from entering because of the amount of luggage he carried. Thankfully one of the grand dukes who was in residence called out a greeting and Carl Fabergé was promptly ushered apologetically into the establishment.

Bainbridge concludes, "Taking him all in all, Fabergé came as near to a complete understanding of human nature as it is possible for a man to come, with one word only inscribed on his banner, and that word – tolerance. There is no doubt whatsoever that this consideration for the worth of others was the foundation for his success."

==Commonwealth and the OAS==
Sanders was perceived to be the frontrunner to become the 6th Commonwealth Secretary-General&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title=Baroness Patricia Scotland becomes first UK citizen to be elected secretary‑general of Commonwealth|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/baroness-patricia-scotland-becomes-first-uk-citizen-to-be-elected-secretary-general-of-commonwealth-a6752211.html|accessdate=27 November 2015|work=The Independent|date=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was backed by the majority of [[CARICOM]] nations heading into a meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government in Malta in November 2015.  There were three candidates: Sanders, proposed by Antigua and Barbuda with the support of the majority of Caribbean countries; Baroness [[Patricia Scotland]], a member of the British House of Lords and a former British government minister, nominated by Dominica where she was born and backed by the British government; and [[Mmasekgoa Masire-Mwamba]], of Botswana, a former Deputy Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Secretariat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/media/news/selection-sixth-commonwealth-secretary-general|title=Selection of the sixth Commonwealth Secretary-General|last=|first=|date=10 November 2015|website=www.thecommonwealth.org|publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sanders' campaign for the post was torpedoed the day before the election by a story in British newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that had been touted to other media but rejected by them.  The story was based on an eleven-year old, unsubstantiated allegation made in an unpublished report by the political party then in office in Antigua and Barbuda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guyanachronicle.com/case-of-ron-sanders-an-abuse-of-power-in-antigua-2/|title=CASE OF RON SANDERS - AN 'ABUSE OF POWER' IN ANTIGUA|last=Singh|first=Rickey|date=11 January 2012|website=www.guyanachronicle.com|publisher=Guyana Chronicle|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, the allegations were roundly condemned by lawyers in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Gov-t-of-Antigua-under-fire-for-Ronald-Sanders-issue_10544014|title=Gov't of Antigua under fire for Ronald Sanders issue|last=|first=|date=11 January 2012|website=www.jamaicaobserver.com|publisher=JamaicaObserver.com|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antiguaobserver.com/sir-gerald-watt-says-police-wrong-to-name-sir-ron/|title=Sir Gerald Watt says police wrong to name Sir Ron|last=|first=|date=9 January 2012|website=antiguaobserver.com|publisher=Antigua Observer Newspaper|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The story also paid scant attention to a published letter in June 2015 by the police commissioner of Antigua and Barbuda saying that the police had no interest in Sir Ronald and that Antigua’s director of public prosecutions had ruled that the allegations against him were “seriously defective” and “disclose no offence”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sirronaldsanders.com/SGCampaign.aspx|title=Letter from the Commissioner of Police|last=|first=|date=29 June 2015|website=www.sirronaldsanders.com|publisher=|access-date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, both Sanders and Masire-Mwamba lost to Patricia Scotland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2015/11/29/baroness-patricia-scotland-elected-new-commonwealth-secretary-general_c1251272|title=Baroness Patricia Scotland elected new Commonwealth Secretary-General|last=|first=|date=29 November 2015|website=www.the-star.co.ke|publisher=The Star, Kenya|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stott's College''' (formally Stott's Business College) is a [[private school|private college]] in [[Australia]], first established in 1883. The primary campus is located in [[Melbourne]], with two other campuses located in [[Sydney]] and [[Perth]].
As of 2018, Stott's College has an approximate 3000 students, most of which are international students.
The amount of graduates from the College is estimated to be within the hundreds of thousands.

Stott's College has three major departments, being Higher Education ([[Bachelor Degree]]), Vocational ([[Diploma]]) and VCE ([[Victorian Certificate of Education]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gooduniversitiesguide.com.au/course-provider/stotts-colleges "VCE information"], Good Universities Guide website&lt;/ref&gt;
Higher Education is split into two separate major streams, business and community services. As of 2018, the most popular Bachelor Degree undertaken at the College is the [[Bachelor of Business]].

==  History ==

[[File:Instruction manual.jpg|thumb| Stott's instruction paper, circa 1960]]
Stott's College was founded in 1883 as a [[Business School]], in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stotts.edu.au/about/introduction/ "Stott's College history"], Stott's College website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.slv.vic.gov.au/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=SLV_VOYAGER2239779&amp;context=L&amp;vid=MAIN&amp;lang=en_US&amp;search_scope=Everything&amp;adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;query=any,contains,stott%27s "Stott's College history"], State Library records&lt;/ref&gt;

The College received more interest during the [[Second World War]], when many Australian women studied business while their husbands were drafted. During this period, it was common for the College to send assessable documents to students via postage, and after completing said criteria the students would send back the assessment; making the College an early adopter of off-site study.

More recently, Stott's College was purchased by [[Acknowledge Education Pty Ltd]] (an educational institution group consisting of the [[Melbourne Language Centre]], [[Front Cooking School]] and [[Acknowledge Creativity]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acknowledgeeducation.edu.au/about/ "Evidence of new ownership"], Acknowledge Education website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campuses ==

[[File:Melbourne campus photo.jpg|thumb| Photo of the Melbourne campus, bearing the owning company logo (Acknowledge Education)]]
Melbourne is home to the main campus, this campus consists of the largest student body, diversity of study and administration. The Melbourne campus is currently the only campus with a secondary education (i.e. VCE) program.

The Perth campus being the second largest, hosts both Higher Education business and community service degrees. While the Sydney campus, being the smallest only hosts community service degrees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3468">The '''Timurite movement''' or '''Timur movement''' (Тимуровское движение) was an [[altruistic]] youth [[volunteering]] movement in the [[Soviet Union]] promoted via mass [[youth organization]]s of [[Little Octobrist]]s and [[Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization|Young Pioneers]]. The participants of the movement were called '''Timurites''' (тимуровцы, '''timurovtsy''').&lt;ref&gt;"Timur Movement Among Soviet Youth", in: ''The Modern Encyclopedia of Russian and Soviet History'', vol. 54, ''[[Academic International Press]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the movement was borrowed from the popular novel for youth ''[[Timur and His Squad]]'' by [[Arkady Gaidar]]. The youngster Timur and his squad clandestinely did good deeds: helped the families of the [[Red Army]] soldiers and combated the local gang of young  [[hooligan]]s headed by Mishka Kvakin. At first Timur's squad was taken for hooligans as well, but eventually they earned gratitude. It was written in 1940, and quickly gained popularity, as other Gaidar's books. The same year a movie was released based on the novel. When the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]] started in 1941, teams of Timurites all over the country, in addition to helping the families of soldiers, did large amounts of unskilled work: cleaning railways from snow, preparing firewood, loading/unloading cargo, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Miller, "Eccentric Propositions: Essays on Literature and the Curriculum", 1984, {{ISBN|0-7100-9987-8}}, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Their activities were widely reported in newspapers and by radio.

The book was an obligatory part of school curriculum in the Soviet Union.

Later the Timurite movement was centralized and organized, with Central Staff and Congresses.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;

Timurite teams were also created in other [[socialist state]]s: [[East Germany|GDR]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], [[People's Republic of Poland]], [[North Vietnam]] and [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]].&lt;ref name=bse&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article110608.html "Timurite movement"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Timurite movement was revived in a number of [[post-Soviet States]]: in [[Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.molodoi-gazeta.ru/article-2326.html Тимуровцы сегодня и всегда! | Molodoi-gazeta.ru&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Belarus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brsm.by/ru/news/details?id=657 Волонтерская социальная акция «Тимуровцы» - Интернет - портал "Молодежь Беларуси" - Подробности / Новости / Русская версия&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503172422/http://www.brsm.by/ru/news/details?id=657 |date=2008-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Kazakhstan]] by [[Jas Otan]], the youth wing of the ruling [[Nur Otan]] party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kazpravda.kz/index.php?uin=1152243624&amp;chapter=1210073650&amp;act=archive_date&amp;day=6&amp;month=5&amp;year=2008 "Staking on youth"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525181419/http://www.kazpravda.kz/index.php?uin=1152243624&amp;chapter=1210073650&amp;act=archive_date&amp;day=6&amp;month=5&amp;year=2008 |date=2011-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1442">A '''turnaround''' (commonly abbreviated '''TAR''') is a scheduled event wherein an entire process unit of an industrial plant ([[Oil refinery|refinery]], [[petrochemical]] plant, [[power plant]], [[pulp and paper]] mill, etc.) is taken offstream for an extended period for revamp and/or renewal. Turnaround is a blanket term that encompasses more specific terms such as I&amp;Ts (inspection &amp; testing), debottlenecking projects, revamps and catalyst regeneration projects. Turnaround can also be used as a synonym of [[Downtime|shutdowns and outages]].

Turnarounds are expensive - both in terms of lost production while the process unit is offline and in terms of direct costs for the labour, tools, heavy equipment and materials used to execute the project.  They are the most significant portion of a plant's yearly maintenance budget and can affect the company's bottom line if mismanaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maintenanceresources.com/bookstore/maintenancemanagement/plantturnarounds.pdf Practical Management for Plant Turnarounds] Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;  Turnarounds have unique project management characteristics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interplansystems.com/project-management-software/project-turnaround.html Project Vs.

'''Unfair (or disloyal) competition''' in [[commercial law]] is a deceptive business practice that causes economic harm to other businesses or to consumers.&lt;ref name="FindLaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unfair Competition|url=http://smallbusiness.findlaw.com/business-laws-and-regulations/unfair-competition-.html|website=FindLaw.com|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LII"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unfair Competition|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/unfair_competition|publisher=Legal Information Institute of Cornell University Law School|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a number of areas of law involving acts by one competitor or group of competitors which harm another in the field, and which may give rise to [[Crime|criminal offenses]] and civil [[Cause of action|causes of action]]. The most common actions falling under the banner of unfair competition include:

* Matters pertaining to [[antitrust]] law, known in the [[European Union]] as [[competition law]]. Antitrust violations constituting unfair competition occur when one competitor attempts to force others out of the market (or prevent others from entering the market) through tactics such as [[predatory pricing]] or obtaining exclusive purchase rights to raw materials needed to make a competing product.
* [[Trademark infringement]] and [[passing off]], which occur when the maker of a product uses a name, logo, or other identifying characteristics to deceive consumers into thinking that they are buying the product of a competitor. In the [[United States]], this form of unfair competition is prohibited under the [[common law]] and by state statutes, and governed at the federal level by the [[Lanham Act]].
* [[Misappropriation]] of [[trade secret]]s, which occurs when one competitor uses [[espionage]], [[bribery]], or outright [[theft]] to obtain economically advantageous information in the possession of another. In the United States, this type of activity is forbidden by the [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]] and the [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]].
* [[Trade libel]], the spreading of false information about the quality or characteristics of a competitor's products, is prohibited at common law.
* [[Tortious interference]], which occurs when one competitor convinces a party having a relationship with another competitor to breach a contract with, or duty to, the other competitor is also prohibited at common law.

Various [[unfair business practices]] such as [[fraud]], [[misrepresentation]], and [[Unconscionability|unconscionable]] [[contract]]s may be considered unfair competition, if they give one competitor an advantage over others. In the [[European Union]], each member state must regulate unfair business practices in accordance with the principles laid down in the [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]], subject to transitional periods. (See also [[trade regulation]] law.)

The '''World Travel Awards''' were founded in 1993. Annually, an international [[Juried (competition)|jury]] of hospitality experts and peers, mainly from the [[World Travel and Tourism Council]], decided on awards presented to [[hotel]]s and other [[hospitality]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=DzvFWbOsiv0C&amp;pg=PA289&amp;dq=world+travel+awards&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VA3dVPHUGMOVyASlrIIY&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=world%20travel%20awards&amp;f=false |title=Sustainability in the Hospitality Industry: Principles of Sustainable Operations |page=289 |author1=Sloan, Philip |author2=Legrand, Willy |author3=Chen, Joseph C. |author4=Chen, Joseph S. |publisher= [[Routledge]] |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awards are given both on a world level and international region level in a wide range of categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Staff | url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1830809/cayman-islands-earns-world-travel-award-anticipates-2015-win/ |publisher=Inquisitr |access-date= 24 June 2015 |date= 10 February 2015 |title=Cayman Islands Earns World Travel Award, Anticipates 2015 Win}}&lt;/ref&gt; Categories include hotel, airline, travel agency, and car-hire company.
