The term “'''adaptation'''” in [[computer science]] refers to a [[wikt:process|process]], in which an [[Interactivity|interactive system]] ([[adaptive system]]) adapts its behaviour to individual users based on [[information]] acquired about its user(s) and its environment.

==The need for adaptation==
A [[software system]] passes through a potentially long [[software engineering]] cycle and before delivery, [[Requirements analysis|requirement engineers]], [[Systems design|designers]] and [[software developers]] realize the components of the system. However, it is impossible to anticipate the [[requirements]] of all users, and a single best or optimal system configuration is impossible. The active involvement of users and clear understanding of user and [[Task (computers)|task]] requirements is a challenge in the [[software development|development]] of computer-based interactive systems for two reasons:

* the potential user groups are not known a prior, but need to be identified according to future [[Scenario (computing)|scenarios]]; these groups need to be revised as the visions evolve because there may be various groups of potentially affected users.
* the visions of the aspired project are far-sighted and not close to users’ current experiences; therefore, users may not be confident and precise about their needs concerning this future system.

With their norm for "[[ISO 13407|Human-centred design processes for interactive systems]]" the [[International Organization for Standardization]] gives guidance on [[user-centered design]] activities throughout the life cycle of computer-based interactive systems.&lt;ref name="ISO"&gt;{{Citation
 | last = ISO13407
 | year = 1999
 | title = Human-Centred Design Processes for Interactive Systems
 | publisher = International Organization for Standardization
}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the core tasks of user-centred design is to negotiate and facilitate the [[communication]] across the well-known [[Participatory culture|user-developer gap]] while acknowledging the different forms of expression and different requirements on each side. However, despite the implementation of a human-centred design process, some types of modern applications require instant adaptation due to their exposure to increasing situational dynamics.

==Adaptivity and adaptability==
Even if the user-centred design process implemented in a project guarantees a certain degree of [[Acceptance testing|user acceptance]] and yields a richer understanding of the context of use, the completed product’s ability to adapt to changing conditions still plays a central role for a broad acceptance. The operational environment will change, the tasks will be distinct, the end-users will be [[heterogeneous]], and their competences and expectations will evolve. Here again it is impossible for developers to anticipate all possible requirements modifications. Thus, the dynamics of changing conditions shifts the customisation process of the system’s characteristics from the development phase to its usage and operation phase because the time needed for a professional development is too short or the new features are too costly.

For this reason, developers implement techniques of adaptation into the system in order to react to changing conditions as fast as possible. The example application scenario clearly shows an important distinction concerning such adaptation techniques: the differentiation between manually and automatically performed adaptation processes. Accordingly, the term adaptation decomposes into the two terms adaptivity and [[adaptability (Computer Science)|adaptability]]. Adaptivity indicates a system that adapts automatically to its users according to changing conditions, i.e. an [[adaptive system]]. Adaptability refers to users that can substantially customise the system through tailoring activities by themselves, i.e. an adaptable system. Adaptive and adaptable systems are complementary to each other.&lt;ref name="oppi"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Oppermann
  | first = Reinhard
  | title = User-Adaptive to Context-Adaptive Information Systems
  | journal = i-com Zeitschrift für interaktive und kooperative Medien
  | volume = 4
  | issue = 3
  | pages = 4–14

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both methods increase the match between user needs and system behaviour once the development of the system has been finished. Thus, the system is kept flexible during usage.

==Catalysts for adaptation==
Changing conditions trigger the execution of an adaptation. Many characteristics might be taken into account as [[Catalysis|catalysts]] for such an adaptation process. They can be clustered into three main categories: inter-individual, intra-individual and environmental differences.

==Inter-individual differences==
Inter-Individual Differences address varieties among several users along manifold dimensions. Physiological characteristics like disabilities are of major concern for application designers if they want to have their system accepted by a large community. The consideration of user [[preferences]] like [[language]], [[colour]] schemes, [[Modality (human–computer interaction)|modality]] of interaction, [[Menu (computing)|menu]] options or [[Computer security|security]] properties, and numberless other personal preferences are popular sources of adaptation and can be reused in different applications. Other sources are the user’s interests and disinterests, [[psychological]] personality characteristics like [[emotions]], [[confidence|self-confidence]], [[motivation]], or [[beliefs]], which are difficult to assess automatically.

==Intra-individual differences==
Intra-individual differences consider the [[Evolution (term)|evolution]] and further development of a single user, as well as the task over time. A static system falls short of changing user requirements as the user’s activities and goals evolve. In an extreme case users are over-strained by the system in the beginning and perceive the same system as cumbersome and restricted as the user’s [[Domain knowledge|expertise]] increases. In the same manner, the need for a higher [[Flexibility (engineering)|flexibility]] of computer systems is pushed by the changing of the tasks to be accomplished with such a system.

==Environmental differences==
Environmental Differences basically result from the [[Mobile computing|mobility]] of computing devices, applications and people, which leads to highly dynamic computing environments. Unlike [[Desktop computer|desktop applications]], which rely on a carefully configured and largely static set of resources, [[ubiquitous computing]] applications are subject to changes in available resources such as network connectivity and input/output devices. Moreover, they are frequently required to cooperate spontaneously and opportunistically with previously unknown software services in order to accomplish tasks on behalf of users. Thus, the environment surrounding an application and its user is a major source to justify adaptation operations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3675">An '''animal nutritionist''' is a person who specializes in [[animal nutrition]], which is especially concerned with the dietary needs of [[animals in captivity]]: [[livestock]], [[pets]], and animals in [[wildlife rehabilitation]] facilities.

The science of animal nutrition encompasses principles of [[chemistry]] (especially [[biochemistry]]), [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[ethology]] (animal behavior). An animal nutrition in the [[food industry]] may also be concerned with [[economics]] and [[food processing]].

==Education==
A [[Bachelor of Science]] in agricultural, biological or related life sciences is usually required. A typical course would study [[metabolism]] of [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[minerals]], [[vitamin]]s and water, and the relationship of these nutrients and animal production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animalscience.calpoly.edu/areas_of_study/nutrition/courses.asp Cal Poly - Areas of Study] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103022826/http://animalscience.calpoly.edu/areas_of_study/nutrition/courses.asp |date=November 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Master’s degree]] in nutrition is often seen in animal nutrition and the field  often requires a [[Ph.D.]] in the science of nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.auburn.edu/ansc/Students&amp;Adv/graduate_programs.html Auburn University Animal Sciences]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016175854/http://www.ag.auburn.edu/ansc/Students%26Adv/graduate_programs.html |date=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career activities ==
Those with an educational background can expect to be employed in the following areas:
*Evaluating the chemical and [[nutritional value]] of various [[animal feeds]], feed supplements, [[grass]] and [[forage]] for livestock, recreational animals such as [[horse]]s and [[pony|ponies]], [[pet food]]s for companion animals, [[fish]], and [[bird]]s
*Nutritional disorders and the preservation of feeds
*Diet formulation and ration size
*Diets for performance and health
*Diets for reproduction of animals
*Economics of feeding systems
*Dietary regimens
*Animal studies and laboratory trials
*Marketing strategies for new food formulas
*Quality control and performance of feeds
*Investigating nutritional disorders and diet related diseases&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Explore_types_of_jobs/Types_of_Job/p!eipaL?state=showocc&amp;pageno=1&amp;idno=17 Exploring job types: Animal nutritionist]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20418">After nearly a century of endeavour and negotiation which had been led by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], a statutory [[Board of Architectural Education]] was formed under the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931]]. For the purposes of constituting the Board of Architectural Education the Act included a list of [[Schools of Architecture, Architects (Registration) Act, 1931|Schools of Architecture]] in the United Kingdom. The statutory Board was abolished in the 1990s, and when the [[Architects Act 1997]] repealed the 1931 Act the statutory list of Schools of Architecture went with it.

The 1931 Act had come to be passed at the end of a century of development in educational provision and in the method of qualifying by examination. The 1997 Act was passed in the period after the [[United Kingdom]] had become one of the Member States of the [[European Economic Community]], later named the [[European Union]], an organization which, among other things, has required Member States to remove obstacles to the freedom of movement and establishment in respect of professional practice, employment, trade and business within the territories of the Union.

The method of qualifying by passing an examination which the RIBA had recognized as allowing exemption continued in the period when the 1931 Act was in force, and remained available under the later legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/TheRIBA/AboutUs/Ourstructure/Constitution/CharterandByelaws.aspx  RIBA Charter and Byelaws]&lt;/ref&gt;

By a further development, from 2007 a Chartered Member of the RIBA may apply for the registration of a Chartered Practice in respect of a business providing architectural services and comprising one or more Chartered Members meeting criteria for, and operating in accordance with, a prescribed scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/TheRIBA/AboutUs/Ourstructure/Constitution/CharterandByelaws.aspx  RIBA Chartered Practice]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==

The historian will find some source material in the Archive which the RIBA has made accessible at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/vam-riba-collections administrative archive of RIBA at V&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt; and in books, periodicals and other publications of the period which have been deposited and retained in the [[British Architectural Library]] (of the RIBA).&lt;ref&gt;[[British Architectural Library]] (of the RIBA)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angela Mace and Robert Thorne ''The Royal Institute of British Architects: a guide to its archive and history'', Mansell Pub.,1986.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another contemporaneous source of information, upon which the following is largely based, is provided by two editions of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|eleventh]] of 1910&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|eleventh]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the fourteenth of 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|fourteenth]]&lt;/ref&gt; These editions contain articles which conveniently indicate how [[Test (assessment)|examination]], as a method of gaining recognition for the attainment of the specialist knowledge and skill required of a professional practitioner, had grown and had been thought of in the period leading up to the passing of the 1931 Act.

==19c Background==

The background to the developments in education and the method of attaining professional qualification had been the unprecedented development of industrial and commercial activity in the United Kingdom and other countries in the course of the nineteenth century. This, and the impact on the working and living conditions of the populations affected, had been making demands for the building of factories, warehouses, offices, educational establishments, hospitals, housing, places of recreation and entertainment and places for religious and other purposes. With that came demands upon architectural practitioners for designs for buildings of all kinds, qualities and standards, for the supervision of the construction of works, and in some cases for making planning schemes for area development or redevelopment, of greater or lesser extent; sometimes collaborating with other branches of the construction professions, notably [[Surveying|surveyors]], [[civil engineers]] and, as the period progressed, [[structural engineering|structural engineers]], and those engaged in
[[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]]. The demand for architectural services, in respect of both traditional and newer materials and techniques, was coming from public bodies, commercial and industrial enterprises, private owners or investors, philanthropists, benefactors and others.
&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Town Extension Plan|The Town Extension Plan]], 1912 Warburton lecture, delivered by [[Raymond Unwin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional arrangements : RIBA==

As a result, institutional arrangements for architectural education became increasingly systematic, in respect of examinations for formal qualifications, and making qualifications a condition for granting some other form of distinguishing style or title (such as Fellow, Associate or Licentiate of a professional body), or for the right or expectation to be able to practise as an [[architect]], on one's own account or as a partner or as an assistant in another's office.

A leading participant in the development of those institutional arrangements was the society which had been formed in London in the 1830s and had petitioned for, and in 1837 had been granted, a charter of incorporation. This society was later granted the name Royal Institute of British Architects, and is for convenience referred to as the RIBA.

==Qualifying examinations==

The index of the eleventh edition offers users very little more about architectural education than a few words in an article on Examinations generally, which was attributed in part to Paul George Konody, Art Critic of ''[[The Observer]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', formerly Editor of ''[[The Artist and Journal of Home Culture]]'', author of ''the Art of [[Walter Crane]]''; ''[[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], Life and Work''; etc. (so described at the page of Wikisource for Paul George Konody&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Author:Paul George Konody]]&lt;/ref&gt;) and in part to Arthur Watson, Secretary in the Academic Department of the [[University of London]]. It began with the paragraph:

:''The term 'examination' (i.e., inspecting, weighing and testing; from Latin ''examen'', the tongue of a balance) is used ''[in the article which followed]'' to denote a systematic test of knowledge, and of either special or general capacity or fitness, carried out under the authority of some public body.''

There followed eight sections beginning with History and ending with a critical appraisal headed ''The Object and Efficiency of Examinations, and their Indirect Effects''. The second section was on Professional Examinations, followed by others on School-leaving Examinations, mentioning the "accrediting" system in the United States started by the [[University of Michigan]] in 1871; Methods of Examination: Written, Oral, Thesis and Practical; Competitive Examinations; The Organization and Conduct of Examinations; and Marking, Classification and Errors of Detail.

==Perspective==

The section on History began as follows:

:''The oldest known system of examinations in history is that used by China for the selection of officers for the public service (c.1115 B.C.), and the periodic tests which they undergo after entry (c.2200). The abolition of this system was announced in 1906, and, as a partial substitute, it was decided to hold an annual examination in Peking of Chinese educated abroad.''

:''The majority of examinations in western countries are derived from the university examinations of the middle ages. The first universities of Europe consisted of corporations of teachers and of students analogous to the trade gilds and merchant gilds of the time. In the trade gilds there were apprentices, companions and masters. No one was admitted to mastership until he had served his apprenticeship, nor, as a rule, until he had shown that he could accomplish a piece of work to the satisfaction of the gild.''

:''The object of the universities was to teach; and to the three classes established by the gild correspond roughly to the scholar, the bachelor or pupil-teacher, and the master or doctor (two terms at first equivalent) who, having first served his apprenticeship and passed a definite technical test, had received permission to teach...''

After a survey of the development of examination practice in the universities of western Europe up to the early 20c., the next section of professional examinations began with the remark "University examinations for degrees having ceased to be used as technical tests of teaching capacity, new examinations have been devised for this purpose". For examinations in Medicine, the article referred the reader to the article on Medical Education, and this section concluded with a single paragraph headed Other Professions, stating that a system of professional examinations carried on by other professional bodies, in some cases with legal sanction, was developed in England during the nineteenth century; and, in a list of subjects described as "the most important" mentioned "architecture (Royal Institute of British Architects )", along with: [[accountancy]], [[actuary|actuarial work]], music, [[pharmacy]], [[plumbing]], [[surveying]], [[veterinary medicine]], technical subjects, e.g. [[cotton-spinning]], [[dyeing]], [[motor manufacturing]], commercial subjects, [[shorthand]] and [[engineering]] (civil, mechanical and electrical).

==As at 1929==

Publication of the fourteenth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica in 1929 happened shortly before the Board of Architectural Education was constituted under the Act of 1931. In it there was an article three pages long on Architectural Education, attributed to [[Lionel Bailey Budden]], MA, ARIBA, Associate Professor of Architecture in the [[University of Liverpool]]. The opening sentence was:

:''Underlying the system of architectural education at present established in most Western countries is the assumption that architecture is one of the fine arts, and that the prime object of the training which the architect should receive is to equip him as a creative artist in building.''

That could be compared with the words of the charter which had been granted to the RIBA in 1837, in which the purpose of the Institute was described as:

:''... for the general advancement of Civil Architecture, and for promoting and facilitating the acquirement of the knowledge of the various arts and sciences connected therewith; it being an art esteemed and encouraged in all enlightened nations, as tending greatly to promote the domestic convenience of citizens, and the public improvement and embellishment of towns and cities...''

When the present supplemental charter was granted in 1971, part of the first charter was revoked but the words quoted were retained.

In the meantime Professor Budden's article of 1929 included the following:

:''... it is generally agreed that the study of architecture should be preceded by a [[liberal education]]. As one of the fine arts, historically associated with the arts of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]], and as the background of [[civilized society]], it demands both for its practice and its appreciation some measure of general culture. The tendency today'' [1929] ''is, therefore, for schools of architecture in Europe, the [[British Empire]] and [[United States|America]] to require from candidates for admission evidence of a broad non-technical education... Today architectural education in all countries is in the hands of practising teachers. Direct connection between the instruction given in the school and the experience of actual practice is thereby assured ...''

The article then considered: [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]] and [[British Dominions|Dominions]], Other European Countries, United States, and [[Mexico]]. It mentioned that the largest school of architecture in England was that of the [[Architectural Association]] (London) and the next that of Liverpool University, and explained the part played by the RIBA:

:''From its foundation in 1835 the Royal Institute of British Architects has been the supreme controlling authority of the profession throughout the empire. At no time, however, has the RIBA itself undertaken the teaching of architecture. But by setting up, in the latter half of the last century [19c.], a centralized system of examinations when no professional tests existed in the country, it performed a notable service in raising the general level of professional knowledge. Through its board of architectural education it has now delegated to certain approved schools the task of qualifying candidates for admission to the institute, only maintaining its own centralized examinations for students not seeking entry through scholastic channels.''

Schools of architecture which were then recognized for exemption from the RIBA final examination (except in the subject of "Professional Practice") were named as:

:''[[Robert Gordon's College]]s, Aberdeen; [[Edinburgh College of Art]]; [[Royal College of Science and Technology|Royal Technical College, Glasgow]]; University of Liverpool; Architectural Association, London; [[University of London]]; [[University of Manchester]]; [[McGill University]], [[Montreal]]; and the [[University of Sydney]].''

Schools in certain institutions which were then recognized for exemption from the RIBA intermediate examination were named as:

:''[[Birmingham School of Art|School of Art, Birmingham]]; [[Royal West of England Academy]], Bristol; [[University of Cambridge]]; [[Bute Building|Technical College, Cardiff]]; [[Leeds College of Art]]s; [[Leicester College of Arts and Crafts]]; [[University of North London|Northern Polytechnic]], London; [[Colleges of Durham University#Colleges in Newcastle|Armstrong College]], [[Newcastle-on-Tyne]]; [[University of Sheffield]]; [[Birmingham School of Art|Municipal School of Arts and Crafts]], [[Southend-on-Sea]]; [[University of Toronto]]; and [[Sir J. J. School of Art]], [[Mumbai|Bombay]].''

It was mentioned that in both classes the maintenance of the requisite standard was assured by the periodic inspection of the visiting board, appointed by the RIBA board of architectural education, which reported to the institute on the work of the various schools granted or applying for exemption.

The system continued after the statutory Board of Architectural Education had been constituted, in connection with the provision in the Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 making it the duty of the Board to recommend "the recognition of any examinations in architecture the passing of which ought, in the opinion of the Board, to qualify persons for registration" under the Act (subsection 5(2)(a)).

Consonant with Professor Budden's remarks at that time, the objects of the RIBA are declared in its charter to be:

:''The advancement of architecture and the promotion of the acquirement of the knowledge of the [[Arts]] and [[Sciences]] connected therewith'';

and the next paragraph in the charter expresses the power of the RIBA to grant [[diplomas]], [[Academic certificate|certificates]] or other forms of recognition.

==Later developments==

The former division of the membership of the RIBA into the two classes of Fellows and Associates ceased under the supplemental charter and byelaws of 1971, but the method of qualifying by passing an examination which the RIBA has recognized as allowing exemption remains available. To be eligible for election to the now undivided class of Chartered Members a candidate is still required to have undertaken courses of study and passed examinations which have been prescribed or recognized by the Council, or to be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Council having had a proper training in architecture.

As the field in which architecture is practised has continued to change, so has the RIBA Chartered Membership been keeping pace. In recent years a [[Byelaw]] was introduced to the effect that practising members are responsible for undertaking continuing professional development, defined in the Byelaws as:

:''The systematic improvement and broadening of knowledge and skill and the development of personal qualities necessary for the execution of professional and technical duties in the course of a Chartered Member's working life.''

A further and more recent development has been the passing of a Byelaw allowing a Chartered Member to apply for the registration of a Chartered Practice, defined in the Byelaws as:

:''a formally-established business providing architectural services and comprising one or more Chartered Members which meets criteria for, and operates in accordance with, a scheme prescribed by the Council, or a board to which the Council has devolved responsibility.''

==Further information==

Professor Budden's article in the fourteenth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica (1929) was published shortly before the passing of the Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 of the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938]]. His School, Liverpool, was one of those listed in the Act for the purpose of constituting the statutory [[Board of Architectural Education]]. When he contributed the article he was Associate Professor in Architecture in the Liverpool University School of Architecture, becoming Roscoe Professor from 1933. He retired in 1952. He had entered the School in 1905, graduated BA in 1909 and MA in 1910, teaching there from 1911 and becoming Associate Professor in 1924. He had been University of Liverpool travelling Scholar in Architecture in 1909, and a student at the British School at Athens 1909-1912. He was first an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (ARIBA), later becoming a Fellow (FRIBA). His architectural work included extensions to Liverpool University Students’ Union.

For further details of the development, in that period, of the policy of the RIBA for architectural education and qualification see  'Statutory Registration – chronology of key events' in [[Architects Registration in the United Kingdom]], and for opposition to the system of registration which was proposed and promoted by successive Bills in Parliament see [[William H. White (architect)|William H. White]],  [[Thomas Graham Jackson]]  and [[John Alfred Gotch]].

[[File:Battle of Germany (1944) (Art.IWM ART LD 4526).jpg|thumb|''Battle of Germany'' by [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], 1944 ]]
During World War II, the relations between art and war can be articulated around two main issues. First, art (and, more generally, culture) found itself at the centre of an ideological war. Second, during World War II, many artists found themselves in the most difficult conditions (in an occupied country, in [[Nazi concentration camp|internment camps]], in [[death camps]]) and their works are a testimony to a powerful "urge to create." Such creative impulse can be interpreted as the expression of self-preservation, a survival instinct in critical times.

==Historical context==
[[File:Battle of Britain (Paul Nash).png|thumb|''Battle of Britain'' by [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], 1941]]
War is a common theme in art and has inspired many great works. Throughout history, most representations of war depict military achievements and often show significant battle scenes. However, in the [[19th century]] a “turn” in the visual representation of war became noticeable. Artists started to show the disastrous aspects of war, instead of its glorified events and protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Bertrand-Dorléac (ed.), ''Les désastres de la guerre, 1800-2014'', exh. cat., Lens, Musée du Louvre-Lens, Somogy, 2014 ; Laura Brandon, ''Art and War'', London: IB Tauris, 2007, p. 26-35&lt;/ref&gt; Such a perspective is best exemplified by [[Francisco Goya]]’s series, [[The Disasters of War]] (1810-1820, first published in 1863), and [[Otto Dix]]’s portfolio, ''Der Krieg'' (published in 1924). 

During [[World War II]], both traditions are present. For instance, [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]]’s ''Battle of Britain'' ([[1941 in art|1941]]) represents a scene of aerial combat between British and [[Wehrmacht|German fighters]] over the [[English Channel]]. On the other hand, André Fougeron’s ''Street of Paris'' ([[1943 in art|1943]]) focuses on the impact of war and occupation on civilians.

==Art in Nazi Germany==

===Nazi art===
{{Main article|Art of the Third Reich}}
{{See also|Paintings by Adolf Hitler}}
[[File:The Worker and Kolkhoz Woman.jpg|thumb|''The Worker and Kolkhoz Woman'' by [[Vera Mukhina]], 1937]

In [[totalitarian]] regimes (especially in [[Hitler]]’s Germany), the control of art and other cultural expressions was an integral part of the establishment of power. It reflects totalitarianism’s aim to control every single aspect of society and the individuals’ lives. However, art and culture had a special importance because they have the power to influence people, and they embody the identity of a nation, a community, a group of people.]]

In [[Nazi Germany]], Hitler's cultural politic was twofold. The first step was a “[[cultural cleansing]]”. German culture and society were said to be in decline because forces of decadence had taken over and corrupted it (it is the idea of the “enemy within”).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The cultural cleansing was to be accompanied by a “rebirth” of German culture and society (Hitler had grand plans for several [[Führermuseum|museums]]), which involved an exaltation of the “true spirit” of the German people in art.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} This officially sanctioned art was conservative and figurative, heavily inspired by [[Greco-Roman]] art. It was often grandiose and sentimental. In terms of contents, this art should represent and convey the regime's ideals.

In 1937 in Munich, two simultaneous events demonstrated the [[Nazis]]’ views about art. One exhibition displayed art that should be eliminated (“The [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]]”), while the other promoted, by contrast, the official aesthetic (“The Great German Art Exhibition”).

In Europe, other [[totalitarian]] regimes adopted a similar stance on art and encouraged or imposed an official aesthetic, which was a form of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]]. Here Realism refers to a representational, mimetic style, and not to an art deprived of idealization. Such style was anchored in a prestigious tradition – popular, easy to understand, and thus practical for [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|propaganda]] aims.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

It was clear in [[Stalin]]’s [[Soviet Union]], where diversity in the arts was proscribed and “[[Socialist Realism]]” was instituted as the official style. [[Modern art]] was banned as being decadent, [[bourgeois]] and elitist.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The comparison of sculptures placed by national pavilions during the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 International Exhibition]] in Paris is revealing. The exhibition was dominated by the confrontation between Germany and the Soviet Union, with their imposing pavilions facing each other.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dawn Adès]] (et al.), ''Art and Power: Europe under the Dictators, 1930-1945'', London: The South Bank Centre, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; On one side, Josef Thorak’s sculptures were displayed by the German pavilion’s entrance. And on the other, [[Vera Mukhina]]’s sculpture, ''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'', was placed on top of the Soviet pavilion.

===Degenerate art===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-729-0001-23, Italien, Überführung von Kunstschätzen.jpg|thumb|German soldiers of the [[Hermann Göring Division]] posing near the main entrance of [[Palazzo Venezia]] showing a painting taken from the National Museum of Naples Picture Gallery]]
[[File:Ausstellung entartete kunst 1937.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Goebbels]] at the [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]]]]
{{Main article|Degenerate Art}}
{{See also|Nazi Plunder}}
The term “degenerate” was used in connection with the idea that modern artists and their art were compromising the purity of the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|German race]]. They were presented as elements of “racial impurity,” “parasites,” causing a deterioration of German society.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} These decadent and “degenerate” forces had to be eradicated. Cultural actors who were labelled “un-German” by the regime were persecuted: they were fired from their teaching positions, artworks were removed from museums, books were burnt.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} All artists who did not fall in line with the party's ideology (above all [[Jewish]] and [[Communist]] artists) were “un-German.”
 
The [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]] (Munich, 19 July-30 Nov. 1937) was made out of works confiscated in German museums. The works were placed in unflattering ways, with derogatory comments and slogans painted around them (“Nature as seen by sick minds”, “Deliberate sabotage of national defense”...). The aim was to convince visitors that modern art was an attack on the German people. Mostly, these works of art were [[Expressionist]], abstract or made by Jewish and [[Leftist]] artists. The exhibition was displayed in several German and Austrian cities. Subsequently, most of the artworks were either [[art destruction|destroyed]] or sold.]]

Modern art could not fall in line with the Nazi values and taste for several reasons:
* its constant innovation and change
* its independency and freedom
* its cosmopolitanism and reticence to profess any type of nationalist allegiance
* its ambiguity and its lack of easily understandable and definitive meaning 
* its rejection and deconstruction of the mimetic tradition of representation{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

France was occupied by Nazi Germany from 22 June 1940 until early May 1945. An occupying power endeavours to normalise life as far as is possible since this optimises the maintenance of order and minimises the costs of occupation. The Germans decreed that life, including artistic life should resume as before (the war).}} There were exceptions. Jews were targeted, and their art collections confiscated. Some of this consisted of modern, [[degenerate art]] which was partly destroyed, although some was sold on the international art market. Masterpieces of European art were taken from these collectors and French museums and were sent to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Richard, L’art et la guerre: Les artistes confrontés à la Seconde guerre mondiale, Paris, Flammarion, 1995, chapter 5, « Butins de guerre » ; Laurence Bertand-Dorléac, ''Art of the Defeat. France 1940-1944'', transl. from French by Jane Mary Todd, Getty Research Institute, 2008, p. 12 and following&lt;/ref&gt; Known political opponents were also excluded and overtly political art was forbidden.

==Persecuted artists==
{{See also|Degenerate Art#Fate of the artists and their work}}
During the rise of Nazism, some artists had expressed their opposition. Following the establishment of the [[Third Reich]], modern artists and those of Jewish ancestry were classed as [[Degenerate art|degenerate]]. Any Jewish artists, or artists who were known opponents to the regime, were liable to imprisonment unless they conformed with the authorities’ view of what was "acceptable" in art. These artists were all in danger. Among those who chose to stay in Germany, some retreated into an “inner exile”, or “inner emigration"&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Richard, ''Le nazisme et la culture'', éditions Complexe, 2006, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; (“Innere Emigration”).

Artists had the choice of collaborating or resisting. But most people in such a predicament will normally find a middle way. Resistance was dangerous and unlikely to escape fierce punishment and while collaboration offered an easier path principled objection to it was a strong deterrent to many if not most. The other options were withdrawal, finding refuge abroad or, for many, to take the pragmatic course by simply continuing to work within the new restrictions. Hence artistic life and expression appeared light, carefree and frivolous, but was also lively.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Alan Riding, ''And the Show Went On: Cultural Life in Nazi-Occupied Paris'', Alfred A. Knopf, 2010; Laurence Bertand-Dorléac, ''Art of the Defeat. France 1940-1944'', transl. from French by Jane Mary Todd, Getty Research Institute, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exiled artists===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-05929, Berlin, KPD-Plakat zu den Reichstagswahlen.jpg|thumb|''5 Fingers Has The Hand'' by John Heartfield, 1928]]
The German artist [[John Heartfield]] (who had been part of [[Dada]] Berlin) is an example of an artist who expressed opposition. While Hitler's popularity was growing in Germany, he consistently produced photomontages that denounced the future dictator and his party. Most of them were published in ''[[Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung]]'' [''AIZ'', Workers' Illustrated Newspaper], and a lot of them appeared on the cover. His artworks were like visual weapons against Nazism, a counter-power. In them, he subverted Hitler's figure and [[Nazi symbols]]. Through powerful visual juxtapositions, he revealed Nazism manipulations and contradictions, and showed the truth about them. As soon as Hitler [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|came to power]] in 1933, Heartfield had to flee, finding refuge first in Prague and then in the UK.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[Otto Dix]] had been labelled as a “degenerate” artist. His works were removed from museums, he was fired from his teaching position, and he was forbidden to create anything political as well as to exhibit. He moved to the countryside and painted landscapes for the duration of the war.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Many artists chose to leave Germany. But their exile did not secure their position in the art world abroad. Their personal and artistic security depended on the laws and attitude of the country of exile. Some sought collaboration with others in exile, forming groups to exhibit, such as the Free German League of Culture founded in 1938 in London.&lt;ref&gt;“Arts in Exile”, virtual exhibition, the German Exile Archive 1933-1945 of the German National Library, 2012: http://kuenste-im-exil.de/KIE/Content/EN/Topics/freier-deutscher-kulturbund-gro%C3%9Fbritannien-en.html (last retrieved: 04-04-2015)&lt;/ref&gt; One of their goals was to show that German culture and art were not to be equated with the cultural expressions sanctioned and produced by the Nazi regime.

Other artists went their own way, independently, often choosing apolitical subjects and sometimes refusing to participate in political events.&lt;ref&gt;Stéphanie Barron (ed.), ''Exiles + Emigrés, The Flight of European Artists from Hitler'', exh. cat.,  Los Angeles County Museum of Art; New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; They considered art as a completely autonomous activity that should not be submitted to a political cause. On the contrary, someone like [[Oskar Kokoschka]], who had until then rejected the idea that art should be useful and serve a cause, got involved in these groups when he emigrated to London in 1938. He created a series of political allegories, i.e. paintings in which he made comments on war politics.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Stéphanie Barron (ed.), ''Exiles + Emigrés, The Flight of European Artists from Hitler'', exh. cat., Los Angeles County Museum of Art, New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1997; Melody A. Maxted, “Envisioning Kokoschka: Considering the Artist’s Political Allegories, 1939-1954”, in ''Montage'', 2 (2008): 87-97&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artists in internment camps===
Once the war had commenced, everyone of Austro-German extraction was considered to be a security risk in Britain and became an [[enemy alien]]. They were interned in 1940, in camps on the Isle of Man. In Britain, however, there was considerable concern that many who had opposed the Nazi regime and escaped with their lives were now in detention in poor conditions. This led to a form of re-classification that led to many early releases in 1940, and by 1942 most of the internees had been released.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Inside the camps, some of the inmates were artists, musicians, and other intelligentsia, and they rebuilt as much cultural life as they could within the constraints of their imprisonment: the giving of lectures and concerts and the creation of artworks from materials like charcoal from burnt twigs, dyes from plants and the use of lino and newspaper. They also received materials from the artistic community in Britain.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[Heinz Kiwitz]] went into exile in 1937 after his release from imprisonment in [[Kemna concentration camp|Kemna]] and [[Emslandlager|Börgermoor concentration camps]]. [[Max Ernst]] exiled to the United States in 1941.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In France, Austro-German citizens also became “enemy aliens” at the outbreak of war and were sent in internment camps. The [[Camp des Milles]], near Aix-en-Provence, where German artists such as Max Ernst and [[Hans Bellmer]] were imprisoned, was famous for its artistic life.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} As France was invaded, the situation of exiled German artists got more complicated and dangerous. They risked deportation, forced labour and extermination in the case of Jewish artists, both in occupied France and in the Vichy Republic. Most chose to emigrate further while others went into hiding.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the US, citizens of Japanese extraction also faced [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment]] in very poor living conditions and with little sympathy for their plight throughout the period of hostilities and beyond.

==World War II art==

===Protest art===

Those who wished to overtly oppose the Nazis in their art either worked abroad (for example, [[André Masson]]) or clandestinely, as part of the resistance movement (such as André Fougeron). In the public space, resistance took on more symbolic forms. A group known as 'Jeunes peintres de tradition française' exhibited in Paris for the first time in 1941. The works they produced during the period were characterised by semi-abstract art and bright colours, which they considered as a form of resistance to the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Richard, ''L’art et la guerre: Les artistes confrontés à la Seconde guerre mondiale'', Paris, Flammarion, 1995, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Other supposedly non-political works were ambiguous – they observed the hardships of life in France without apportioning blame. [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], who had stayed in Paris, painted but refused to exhibit. He did not paint the war or anything openly political, but he said that the war was in his pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Picasso, in Peter D. Whitney, “Picasso is Safe”, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 3 Sept. 1944, quoted by M. Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern art became the bearer of liberal values, as opposed to the reactionary artistic preferences of the totalitarian regimes. Artistic choices embodied different positions in the ongoing ideological battle. Placing Alberto Sánchez Pérez's abstract sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;See Dawn Ades (et al.), ''Art and Power: Europe under the Dictators, 1930-1945'', London: The South Bank Centre, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Spanish people have a path that leads to a star'' (1937), at the entrance of the pavilion of the Spanish Republic was a political statement. So was commissioning modern artists to create works of art for this pavilion. [[Pablo Picasso]] showed two works: a pair of etchings entitled ''[[The Dream and Lie of Franco]]'', 1937, and his monumental painting, [[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]], 1937. [[Joan Miró]] painted a huge mural entitled ''Catalan Peasant in Revolt'' (aka [[The Reaper (Miró painting)|The Reaper]], destroyed), and he did a poster entitled “Aidez l’Espagne” (Help Spain), meant to support the Republicans’ cause. The American artist [[Alexander Calder]] created the abstract sculpture ''[[Mercury Fountain]]'' (1937). The involvement of a non-Spanish artist was also an important statement in an era dominated by the rise of nationalism, both in democratic and totalitarian regimes.

Even in democracies, voices called for a return to a more representational style. For instance, some criticized the central place given to Picasso's [[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]] because it was not explicit enough in its denunciation and was too complex.&lt;ref&gt;Monica Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 25. Robin A. Greeley, S''urrealism and the Spanish Civil War'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; They would have preferred that the focus be placed on paintings such as [[Horacio Ferrer]]’s ''Madrid 1937 (Black Planes)'', from 1937. Its “message” was much clearer and – as a consequence – it functioned better as a political statement.

When they wanted to support the democratic cause and protest against [[Fascism]] and [[dictators]], artists were often encouraged to put aside their modernist style and express themselves in a more realist (i.e. representational) style. For instance, [[Josep Renau]], the Republican Government's director general of Fine Arts, said in 1937: “The poster maker, as an artist, knows a disciplined freedom, a freedom conditioned by objective demands, external to his individual will. Thus for the poster artist the simple question of expressing his own sensibility and emotion is neither legitimate nor practically realizable, if not in the service of an objective goal.&lt;ref&gt;Josep Renau, quoted by M. Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;” And the French author, [[Louis Aragon]], declared in 1936: “For artists as for every person who feels like a spokesperson for a new humanity, the Spanish flames and blood put [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Aragon, in ''La Commune'', 1936, quoted by [[Lionel Richard]], ''L’art et la guerre: Les artistes confrontés à la Seconde guerre mondiale'', Paris, Flammarion, 1995 (transl. from French)&lt;/ref&gt;” In other words, the artist's political engagement required a submission of the work's artistic aspects to the expression of the political content.

The series ''The Year of Peril'', created in [[1942 in art|1942]] by the American artist [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], illustrates how the boundary between art and propaganda can be blurred by such a stance. Produced as a reaction to the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]] by the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]] in 1941, the series portrayed the threat posed to the U.S. by Nazism and Fascism in an expressive but representational style. The message is clearly and powerfully delivered. These images were massively reproduced and disseminated in order to contribute to raise support for the U.S. involvement in World War II.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Thus, there can be troubling affinities between Allied politically-engaged art and fascist and totalitarian art when in both cases art and artists are used to create “persuasive images”, i.e. visual propaganda. Such a conception of political art was problematic for many modern artists as modernism was precisely defined by its autonomy from anything non-artistic. For some, absolute artistic freedom – and thus freedom from the requirement of having a clear, stable, and easily decipherable meaning – should have been what symbolised the liberal and progressive values and spirit of democracies.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political art===
[[File:Shelter Experiments, near Woburn, Bedfordshire (Art. IWM ART LD 3859).jpg|thumb|''Shelter Experiments, near Woburn, Bedfordshire'' by [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], 1943]]
[[File:The City A fallen lift shaft (1941) (Art.IWM ART LD 893).jpg|thumb|''The City A fallen lift shaft'' by [[Graham Sutherland]], 1941]]
Britain was also subject to political differences during the 1930s but did not suffer repression nor civil war as elsewhere, and could enter World War II with a justifiable sense of defending freedom and democracy. Art had similarly followed the free expression at the heart of modernism, but political appropriation was already sought [as in the left-wing [[Artists’ International Association]] founded in 1933]. With the outbreak of war came official recognition of art's use as propaganda. However, in Britain, political promotion did not include the persecution of artistic freedom in general.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 1939, the [[War Artists Advisory Committee]] (WAAC) was founded under the aegis of the British Ministry of Information, with the remit to list and select artists qualified to record the war and pursue other war purposes. Artists were thought to have special skills useful to a country at war:  they could interpret and express the essence of wartime experiences and create images that promoted the country's culture and values. Not the least of these was artists’ freedom to choose the subjects and style of their art.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} A significant influence was the choice of Sir [[Kenneth Clark]] as instigator and director of WAAC, as he believed that the first duty of an artist was to produce good works of art that would bring international renown. And he believed the second duty was to produce images through which a country presents itself to the world, and a record of war more expressive than a camera may give.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Important to this was the exhibition of Britain at War at [[New York Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art]] in New York in 1941 (22 May to 2 September).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

This initiative also provided support for British artists when the world seemed to be sinking into barbarism. But it was not without intentions and constraints, and some works were rejected or censored. Accurate representations were required and abstract art, as it did not deliver a clear message, was avoided. Some depictions could be too realistic and were censored because they revealed sensitive information or would have scared people – and maintaining the nation's morale was vital. No foreign artists were admitted to the programme, a great sorrow to many who had fled to Britain from persecution elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Despite these restrictions, the work commissioned was illustrative, non-bombastic, and often of great distinction thanks to established artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Graham Sutherland]] and [[Stanley Spencer]].

===Holocaust art===
{{Main article|The Holocaust in popular culture}}
Many works of art and images were created by detainees in ghettos and in concentration and extermination camps. They form a large body of images. Most of them were small and fragile, many were destroyed and lost. The large majority of these images were created clandestinely because such a creative activity was forbidden and could have resulted in a death sentence. Yet, many inmates found materials and transgressed the rules in order to create.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Their motives for doing so were multiple but they all seem to have been linked to a survival instinct and self-preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Richard, ''L’art et la guerre: Les artistes confrontés à la Seconde guerre mondiale'', Paris, Flammarion, 1995, p. 216: for some internees, art had a « live-saving function » (transl. from French)&lt;/ref&gt; Art could be a distraction and an escape from the horrors of the present. Distancing oneself (by depicting imaginary scenes or by taking on the role of the observer) was a way to keep some sanity. Doing drawings could also be a way to barter and thus to increase one's chances of survival in the camp or ghetto. Moreover, by creating visual artefacts there was the hope of creating something that would survive to one's death and would live on to testify to one's existence. Some seemed to have been animated by a documentary spirit: recording what was happening to them for people beyond the fence. Finally, such a creative urge was a form of cultural resistance. When their persecutors were trying to eradicate every bit of their humanity, artistic creation and testimony were ways to reclaim it, to preserve and cultivate it.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In terms of subject matters, the images created in concentration and extermination camps are characterised by their determination to enhance the detainees’ dignity and individuality.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; This is probably the most visible in the numerous portraits that were done. Whereas the Nazi extermination machine aimed at dehumanising the internees, creating “faceless” beings, clandestine artists would give them back their individuality. In this body of works, depictions of atrocities are not so frequent, which suggests that they might have been intentionally avoided. Rather, it is after the liberation, in the art of survivors that the most brutal and abominable aspects of concentration and extermination camps found a visual expression.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the face of such horrors, some artists were confronted with ethical problems and felt that representation had reached a limit. Thus, since the liberation of the camps, artists who have wanted to express the [[Holocaust]] in their art have often chosen abstraction or symbolism, thus avoided any explicit representations. A few went as far as to suggest that art itself – and not simply representational art – had reached a limit because creating an aesthetic object about the Holocaust would be, in itself, unethical, morally reprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

The Balbino de Freitas Archaeological Collection was one of the collections on display in [[National Museum of Brazil]], in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. It reunited works belonging to the house of [[Balbino Luiz de Freitas]], one of the first archaeological collections of Brazil. The collection was [[Cultural heritage management|listed]] by the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage|IPHAN]] in [[1938]].

The collection was assembled by Freitas, especially with indigenous objects of [[Torres, Rio Grande do Sul|Torres]]. A [[basket]] was one of the main elements of the collection, collected in a [[sambaqui]] in the coastal area. The importance of the piece is given by the difficult maintenance of objects made with organic material in tropical countries, such as [[Brazil]].

This archaeological collection was, at least in part, destroyed in the fire of 2018 in the National Museum [[National Museum of Brazil fire|the fire of 2018 in the National Museum]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1958">'''Mental state''' is generally a literary or legal term, and is only used in [[psychiatry]] or [[psychology]] as the mental state examination, where  it refers to the condition of someone's mind. Here there is an assessment of thought processes, memory, mood, [[cognitive]] state, and energy level. Where a mental state is shared by a large proportion of the members of a group or society, it can be called a collective mental state. [[Gustave Le Bon]] proposed that mental states are passed by [[Infectious disease|contagion]], while [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote of [[war fever]] in his work ''[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]'' (1922), a perfect example of the collective mental state. [[Franz Borkenau]] wrote of collective madness, while many writers have discussed [[collective depression]]. [[Psychosis]] can be passed from one individual to another as induced psychosis or ''folie à deux'', but rarely involves more than two people. Where the mental state involves a large population, it is more appropriate to use plain English rather than psychiatric or psychological terminology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6171">'''Cone tracing'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |citeseerx=10.1.1.129.582 |doi=10.1145/964965.808589 |title=Ray tracing with cones |journal=ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=129 |year=1984 |last1=Amanatides |first1=John }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[beam tracing]] are a derivative of the [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] [[algorithm]] that replaces rays, which have no thickness, with thick rays.

==Principles==
This is done for two reasons:

===From a [[Light transport theory|physics of light transport]] point of view===
The energy reaching the pixel comes from the whole [[solid angle]] by which the eyes see the pixel in the scene, not from its central sample. This yields the key notion of '''pixel footprint''' on surfaces or in the [[texture space]], which is the back projection of the pixel on the scene.

The description above corresponds to the [[pinhole camera]] simplified optics classically used in [[computer graphics]]. Note that this approach can also represent a lens-based camera and thus [[depth of field]] effects, using a cone whose cross-section decreases from the lens size to zero at the [[focal plane]], and then increases.

Moreover, a real optical system does not focus on exact points because of [[Airy disc|diffraction]] and imperfections. This can be modeled as a [[point spread function]] (PSF) weighted within a solid angle larger than the pixel.

===From a signal processing point of view===
Ray-tracing images suffer strong [[aliasing]] because the "projected geometric signal" has very high frequencies exceeding the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|Nyquist-Shannon maximal frequency]] that can be represented using the pixel sampling rate, so that the input signal has to be low-pass filtered - i.e., integrated over a solid angle around the pixel center.

Note that contrary to intuition, the filter should not be the pixel footprint since a [[Rectangular function|box filter]] has poor spectral properties. Conversely, the ideal [[sinc function]] is not practical, having infinite support and possibly negative values. A [[Gaussian filter|Gaussian]] or a [[Lanczos resampling|Lanczos]] filter are considered good compromises.

==Computer graphics models==
Cone and Beam early papers rely on different simplifications: the first considers a circular section and treats the intersection with various possible shapes. The second treats an accurate pyramidal beam through the pixel and along a complex path, but it only works for [[polyedrical]] shapes.

Cone tracing solves certain problems related to [[Sample (signal)|sampling]] and aliasing, which can plague conventional ray tracing. However, cone tracing creates a host of problems of its own. For example, just intersecting a cone with scene geometry leads to an enormous variety of possible results. For this reason, cone tracing has remained mostly unpopular. In recent years, increases in computer speed have made [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] algorithms like [[distributed ray tracing]] - i.e. stochastic explicit integration of the pixel - much more used than cone tracing because the results are exact provided enough samples are used. But the convergence is so slow that even in the context of off-line rendering a huge amount of time is required to avoid [[Image noise|noise]]. Recent works focus on removing this noise with machine learning techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/3072959.3073601 |title=Interactive reconstruction of Monte Carlo image sequences using a recurrent denoising autoencoder |journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=1 |year=2017 |last1=Chaitanya |first1=Chakravarty R.

Differential cone-tracing, considering a differential angular neighborhood around a ray, avoids the complexity of exact geometry intersection but requires a LOD representation of the geometry and appearance of the objects. [[Mipmap|MIPmapping]] is an approximation of it limited to the integration of the surface texture within a cone footprint. Differential ray-tracing &lt;ref&gt;Homan Igehy. "Tracing Ray Differentials". http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/papers/trd/&lt;/ref&gt; extends it to textured surfaces viewed through complex paths of cones reflected or refracted by curved surfaces. The full differential cone-tracing - including geometry and appearance filtering - is mostly applicable as volumetric cone-tracing,&lt;ref&gt;Fabrice Neyret. "Modeling Animating and Rendering Complex Scenes using Volumetric Textures". http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00537523&lt;/ref&gt; relying on 3D MIPmapping.

A '''construction contract''' is a mutual or legally binding [[Contract|agreement]] between two parties based on policies and conditions recorded in document form. The two parties involved are one or more [[owner]]s, and one or more [[General contractor|contractor]]s. The owner has full authority to decide what type of contract should be used for a specific development to be constructed and to set forth the legally-binding terms and conditions in a [[contractual agreement]].&lt;ref name="Contracts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://civilengineerlink.com/common-types-construction-contracts/ | title=Main types of contracts | accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
`
==Types==
The six types of contracts are:
*Lump sum contract
*Percentage Rate Contract
*Item rate contract/unit price contract 
*Lump sum and scheduled contract&lt;ref name="Common types of construction contracts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://construction.about.com/od/Construction-Management/a/Types-Of-Construction-Contracts.htm | title=Common types of construction contracts | accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
PERCENTAGE RATE CONTRACT:
when the lowest rate and comparative position among the contractors are already specified prior to the opening of the tender, then the percentage rate contract is used. In this type of contract there is no possibility of unbalanced tender. 
*Cost plus fixed fee contract
*Cost plus percentage of cost contract
*Special contracts&lt;ref name="A text book of Production Planning and Management"&gt;{{cite book | title=A text book of Production Planning and Management | author=Dr. B.C Punmia | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lump sum contract===

In a lump sum contract an owner agrees to pay a contractor a specified lump sum after the completion of work without a cost breakdown.&lt;ref name="Business dictionary1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://m.businessdictionary.com/definition/lump-sum-contract.html | title=Business dictionary | accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Lump sum contract"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://construction.about.com/od/Procurement-Process/a/Lump-Sum-What-Is-A-Lump-Sum.htm | title=Lump sum contract | accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After work no detailed measurements is required.

===Lump sum and scheduled contract===
In lump sum contract the complete work as per plan and specifications is carried out by contractor for certain fixed amount as per agreement. The owner provides required information and contractor charges certain amount. This contract is suitable when the number of items are limited or when it is possible to work out exact quantities of work to be executed. The detailed specifications of all items of work, plans and detail drawings, security deposit, penalty, progress and other condition of contract are included in agreement.Though it is lump sum and scheduled contract, contractor will be paid at regular interval of 2-3 months as per progress of work on the basis of certificate issued by engineer in charge. A scheduled of rate is included in agreement for making payment of extra items.

===Cost plus fixed fee contract===

In cost plus fixed fee, the owner pays the contractor an agreed amount over and above the documented cost of work.&lt;ref name="India study"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiastudychannel.com/projects/2054-Various-types-of-Civil-Engineering-Contracts.aspx | title=India study channel | work=by Owais Khursheed | accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost plus percentage of cost contract===
In cost plus percentage, the owner pays greater than 100 percent of the documented cost, usually requiring detailed expense accounting.&lt;ref name="Business dictionary2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://m.businessdictionary.com/definition/cost-plus-percentage-contract.html. | title=Cost plus percentage of cost contract | work=by Owais Khursheed | accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this type of contract, contractor is paid the actual cost of work plus certain percentage as profit. Various contract documents, drawing, specifications are not necessary at the time of signing the agreement.Contractor has to keep all records for cost of material and labour and contractor will be paid accordingly to engineer incharge.This type of contract is suitable for emergency work like difficulties in foundation conditions, construction of expensive structure etc.

===Special contracts===
{{expand section|date=August 2016}}
Special contracts are further classified into five types:
*Turn key contract

*Negotiated  contract
*Package contract
*Continuing contract
*Running contract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Production Planning and Management | author=Dr. B.C. Punmia | date=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Convolute''' as a verb literally means to "roll together" or "roll around", from the Latin ''convolvere''. In general application the word can mean to "tangle" or "complicate", but in botanical descriptions convolute usually is an adjective from the Latin ''convolutus'', meaning "rolled around".&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt; It commonly refers to a special class of [[imbricate]] structures &amp;mdash; those where the overlapping edges of leaves, scales or similar elements are spirally wrapped, each scale having one edge within the previous scale and one outside the next scale. In the family [[Restionaceae]] the leaf sheaths commonly are convolute in this sense.&lt;ref name= "DyerGen"&gt;Dyer, R. Allen, The Genera of Southern African Flowering Plants”. {{ISBN|0 621 02854 1}}, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; However in structures such as a [[spathe]], where there is only one element, a convolute (or "convolutive") element is spirally wrapped around itself or its branch.&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"/&gt; This is common in the buds of leaves and inflorescences of members of the family [[Araceae]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2643">'''Cutan''' is one of two [[biopolymer]]s which occur in the [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] of some plants. The other and better-known polymer is [[cutin]]. Cutan is believed to be a [[hydrocarbon]] polymer, whereas cutin is a [[polyester]], but the structure and synthesis of cutan are not yet fully understood. Cutan is not present in as many plants as once thought; for instance it is absent in ''[[Ginkgo]]''.&lt;ref name=Briggs1999&gt;{{Cite journal

Cutan was first detected as a non-[[saponification|saponifiable]] component, resistant to de-[[esterification]] by [[alkaline hydrolysis]], that increases in amount in cuticles of some species such as ''[[Clivia miniata]]'' as they reach maturity, apparently replacing the cutin secreted in the early stages of cuticle development (Schmidt and Schönherr, 1982). Evidence that cutan is a hydrocarbon polymer comes from the fact that its flash [[pyrolysis]] products are a characteristic [[homologous series]] of paired [[alkane]]s and [[alkene]]s (Nip ''et al.'' 1986)

Its preservation potential is much greater than that of cutin.&lt;ref name="Briggs1999"/&gt;

'''''Environmental Pollution''''' is a peer-reviewed academic journal covering the biological, health, and ecological effects of [[environmental pollution]]. It was established in 1980 as two parts: '''''Environmental Pollution Series A: Ecological and Biological''''' and '''''Environmental Pollution Series B: Chemical and Physical'''''. These parts were merged in 1987 to form the journal under its current title. It is published by [[Elsevier]] and the [[editors-in-chief]] are [[David O. Carpenter]] ([[University at Albany, SUNY]]) and [[Eddy Y. Zeng]] ([[Jinan University]]). According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2017 [[impact factor]] of 4.358.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apps.clarivate.com/jif/home?journal=ENVIRON%20POLLUT&amp;year=2017&amp;editions=SCIE&amp;pssid=H2-AZRD5x2B9qh6pmAHIJhOM94Ng6jcJo6rb8-18x2dD1IGV2lWg4d6ZPQtUZbfUAx3Dx3Di3mfiS4ErRAc2xxhXyFSW1Ax3Dx3D-YwBaX6hN5JZpnPCj2lZNMAx3Dx3D-jywguyb6iMRLFJm7wHskHQx3Dx3D|title=InCites Journal Citation Reports|website=apps.clarivate.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;Today millions of people are without basic needs of cloth, shelter, health, education and employment. This is not due to overpopulation alone but also due to environmental consequences. The loss of forests, fertility of soil, productivity and energy crisis have created many problems. The pollution created by industries, technology etc. and over-consumption by the affluent society lead to the rapid depletion of basic natural resources. Many human problems are also due to mismanagement of environment which is created by man himself.

== Functions ==
Filter strips are primarily used in agriculture to control nonpoint source pollution. They function by decreasing the velocity of water, allowing runoff and dissolved inorganic molecules to infiltrate the soil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rcdmonterey.org/filter-strip "Filter Strip | RCD Of Monterey County"]. ''Resource Conservation District of Monterey County''. Retrieved 2017-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetation then uptakes these inorganic molecules, notably nitrogen and phosphorus, reducing their concentrations in nearby surface water.

Filter strips may also be used as sediment traps to reduce sediment in storm water runoff from construction sites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Eutrophication in a lake caused by nonpoint pollution from agriculture
Filter strips are commonly used to prevent [[eutrophication]] in surface waters. Eutrophication is a widespread problem in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal oceans, directly caused by the over-enrichment of nitrogen and phosphorus; the source of which is overwhelmingly nonpoint pollution from agriculture.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=S. R.|last2=Caraco|first2=N. F.|last3=Correll|first3=D. L.|last4=Howarth|first4=R. W.|last5=Sharpley|first5=A. N.|last6=Smith|first6=V.

As they are decomposed by microorganisms, oxygen is depleted, resulting in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]]. This can lead to [[Fish kill|fishkills]] and the mass deaths of other fauna, creating a state of severely reduced biodiversity.

=== Impact on human health ===
By reducing the concentration of chemical fertilizers in surface water, filter strips have a positive effect on human health. Although elevated concentrations of phosphorus in water is not directly toxic to humans, nitrates poses a serious risk to human health.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; At high concentrations, the ingestion of nitrates can result in an acute condition known as [[methemoglobinemia]] in which the oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin is impaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=Mary H.|last2=deKok|first2=Theo M.|last3=Levallois|first3=Patrick|last4=Brender|first4=Jean|last5=Gulis|first5=Gabriel|last6=Nolan|first6=Bernard T.|last7=VanDerslice|first7=James|date=November 2005|title=Workgroup Report: Drinking-Water Nitrate and Health—Recent Findings and Research Needs|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=113|issue=11|pages=1607–1614|doi=10.1289/ehp.8043|issn=0091-6765|pmc=1310926|pmid=16263519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants are especially susceptible, which is why the disease is colloquially referred to as "blue baby syndrome."

In areas where humans rely on fishing or aquafarming for nourishment, decreased populations of fish and shellfish can lead to undernourishment and associated diseases.

== Types ==

=== Vegetative filter strip ===
Vegetative filter strips are small, edge-of-field tracts of vegetated land. This type of filter strip is planted with a perennial grass or legumes that have a high rate of nitrogen fixation. Several species are used. The most common grasses are switchgrass, orchardgrass, and tall fescue. Typical legumes are clovers and alfalfa.

=== Prairie filter strip ===
Prairie filter strips function in the same manner as vegetative filter strips, however they are populated with local prairie grasses. The use of prairie grass has some benefits, especially increased biodiversity, as opposed to vegetative filter strips, and their multilayered root systems and strong stems make them better suited for adverse weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrem.iastate.edu|title=Natural Resource Ecology and Management|website=www.nrem.iastate.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Riparian buffer on Bear Creek in Story County, Iowa.JPG|thumb|A forested riparian buffer on Bear Creek in Story County, Iowa]]

=== Forested riparian buffer ===
Like prairie filter strips, forested riparian buffers are filter strips that are not planted, but rather, are populated by indigenous trees and other flora.They are better able to support local terrestrial fauna. As opposed to undisturbed land, riparian buffers support a significantly greater number of avian and arthropod species. However, they are not able to support as large of a number of species as undisturbed land.&lt;ref&gt;Marczak, Laurie B., et al. Are Forested Buffers an Effective Conservation Strategy for Riparian Fauna ? An Assessment Using Meta-Analysis Published by : Wiley Stable URL : &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/27797793&lt;/nowiki&gt; REFERENCES Linked References Are Available on JSTOR for This Article : Yo. Vol. 20, no. 1, 2016, pp. 126–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wind buffer ===
Wind buffers (also referred to as windbreaks) are rows of planted trees or shrubs which are used to prevent soil erosion in fields. Additionally, they may be used to prevent the drifting of snow onto roadways and can reduce noise along highways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nac.unl.edu/practices/windbreaks.htm|title=Windbreaks|website=nac.unl.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
Filter strips are highly effective in reducing the concentration of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in runoff into surface water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Zhou et al. (2014) found that prairie filter strips reduced the concentration of nitrate, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus in runoff by 35%, 73%, and 82% respectively. Abu-Zreig, Majed, et al. (2003) found that vegetated filter strips were effective in reducing the concentration of phosphorus, with results ranging from 61% to 89% for 2m-wide filter strips and 15m-wide filter strips respectively.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This indicates that filter strips are effective at even small widths.

Filter strips have also been shown to be very effective in sediment trapping. A study of sediment removal found that prairie filter strips had a 96% sediment trapping efficiency over a 4-year period.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As with nitrogen and phosphorus reduction, the sediment trapping efficiency of a filter strip varies by a number of factors, including subsurface conditions, surface conditions, and sediment characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osman Akan A.|last2=Atabay Serter|date=2017-03-01|title=Suspended Sediment Trap Efficiency of Vegetative Filter Strips|url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29HE.1943-5584.0001469|journal=Journal of Hydrologic Engineering|volume=22|issue=3|pages=06016018|doi=10.1061/(asce)he.1943-5584.0001469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
The use of filter strips is very common throughout the developed world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Their use is stipulated by law in some areas. Minnesota, for example, requires farmers to install a filter strip along all public bodies of water and drainage ditches.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Cost ==
The main cost associated with filter strips is the decrease in yield due to a loss of cultivatable land.&lt;ref&gt;Helmers, Matthew J., et al. “Buffers and Vegetative Filter Strips.” Gulf Hypoxia and Local Water Quality Concerns Workshop September 26–28, 2005, Ames, IA, 2006, p. 17, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-07/documents/2006_8_24_msbasin_symposia_ia_session4-2.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Other costs are those associated with creating, planting, and maintaining a filter strip. The annual private cost of maintaining two filter strips on a Missouri watershed was found to be $62.40/ac.(4046.86m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; though cost varies by location due to different land values.

==Case studies==
In the first reported [[case study]], the patient had started keeping ants in a cupboard of his room as a hobby when he was nine. At this age he enjoyed "the ticklish feeling" of the ants crawling on his legs and thighs. At age ten, he had a sexual relationship with another boy, and was beaten when his father discovered this. By the age of 13 or 14, he had added [[snail]]s and [[cockroach]]es to his collection, and was becoming increasingly preoccupied with it. He had begun masturbating while the ants crawled on his legs. At age 28, he was masturbating several times a week while cockroaches crawled on his thighs and testicles, and snails crawled over his nipples and penis. Sometimes he would hold a frog against his penis and enjoy the vibrations as it tried to escape. The patient was disgusted by his habit, but derived no pleasure from normal sexual activities. John Money suggested that the paraphilia developed as an alternative outlet after his normal sexual expression became associated with the trauma of his father's punishment.&lt;ref name="money" /&gt;

Another case was described in 2012. At the age of 14, the patient saw an ice-cream stick covered with ants, and wondered how it would feel if his penis was in place of the stick. He began letting ants crawl on his genitals, especially [[fire ant]]s, a practice he found sexually exciting and that continued into adulthood. The patient was socially and intellectually competent. He was also attracted to dogs and goats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Spizzirri, G. |author2=Becher, G. |author3=Reis, J. |author4= Abdo, C. H.

'''Gay sexual practices''' are [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] involving [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM), regardless of their [[sexual orientation]] or [[sexual identity]]. The authors of the 1948 [[Kinsey Reports]] state that 37% of their male subjects had had at least one homosexual experience.&lt;ref&gt;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, p. 656&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence shows that sex between men is significantly underreported in surveys due to [[social desirability bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Turner CF, Ku L, Rogers SM, Lindberg LD, Pleck JH, Sonenstein FL |title=Adolescent sexual behavior, drug use, and violence: increased reporting with computer survey technology |journal=Science  |volume=280 |issue=5365 |pages=867–73 |date=May 1998 |pmid=9572724 |doi=10.1126/science.280.5365.867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nber.org"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Size of the LGBT Population and the Magnitude of Anti-Gay Sentiment are Substantially Underestimated |journal=Management Science |volume=63 |issue=10 |pages=3168–3186 |year=2013 |first1=Katherine B. |last1=Coffman |first2=Lucas C. |last2=Coffman |first3=Keith M.

Wellings et al. reported that "the equation of 'homosexual' with 'anal' sex among men is common among lay and health professionals alike," whereas an [[online survey]] of 18,000 MSM in Europe "showed that oral sex was most commonly practised, followed by mutual masturbation, with anal intercourse in third place."&lt;ref name="Wellings"/&gt; A 2011 survey by ''[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'' found similar results for U.S. gay and bisexual men. Kissing a partner on the mouth (74.5%), oral sex (72.7%), and partnered masturbation (68.4%) were the three most common behaviors, with 63.2% of the sample self-reporting five to nine different sexual behaviors during their last encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02438.x | volume=8 | title=Sexual Behaviors and Situational Characteristics of Most Recent Male‐Partnered Sexual Event among Gay and Bisexually Identified Men in the United States | year=2011 | journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine | pages=3040–3050 | author=Rosenberger Joshua G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among men who have anal sex with other men, the insertive partner may be referred to as the ''[[Top (sex)|top]]'', the one being penetrated may be referred to as the ''[[Bottom (sex)|bottom]]'', and those who enjoy either role may be referred to as ''[[versatile (sex)|versatile]]''.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; Pleasure, pain, or both may accompany anal sex.

Frot can be enjoyable because it mutually and simultaneously stimulates the genitals of both partners as it tends to produce pleasurable friction against the [[Frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenulum]] nerve bundle on the underside of each man's penile shaft, just below the [[External urethral orifice (male)|urinary opening]] (meatus) of the penis [[glans penis|head]] (glans penis). [[Intercrural sex]] is another form of non-penetrative sex that can be practiced between MSM.

==Organisation==

The GIGA was founded in 1964 as the German Overseas Institute (Deutsches Übersee-Institut) by the City of Hamburg and the Hamburg business community. It was initially the umbrella organisation for the Institute of Asian Affairs, the German Orient Institute, the Institute of Latin American Affairs and the Institute of African Affairs.

In the first decade of this century the German Overseas Institute underwent a transformation that saw the previously relatively autonomous regional institutes united as the GIGA German Institute of Global and Area Studies/Leibniz-Institut für Globale und Regionale Studien in 2007. Only the German Orient Institute did not take part in the fusion. However, the GIGA had already hired many of its employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/50-years-of-GIGA 50 Years of GIGA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The GIGA collaborates with numerous renowned universities, research institutes and expert associations around the world. It is represented on the boards of various academic networks, particularly those related to Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alacip.org/?page_id=2249 Asociación Latinoamericana de Ciencia Política (ALACIP)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desigualdades.net/acerca_de_la_red/junta_directiva/index.html desiguALdades.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513211710/http://www.desigualdades.net/acerca_de_la_red/junta_directiva/index.html |date=May 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vad-ev.de/index.php?id=8 Vereinigung für Afrikawissenschafen in Deutschland (VAD)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asienkunde.de/index.php?file=organe_vorstand.html&amp;folder=organe Deutsche Gesellschaft für Asienkunde e.V. (DGA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The GIGA is a foundation under civil law and is based in Hamburg. It is jointly funded by the Federal Foreign Office, the Hamburg Ministry of Science and Research and the other federal states. The GIGA also receives external funding, which accounts for around 25 per cent of the total budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giga-hamburg.de/de/the-giga Founding of GIGA]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, Prof. Dr. [[Amrita Narlikar]] is the president of the GIGA. Together with the president, the GIGA executive board comprises Asia researcher Prof. Dr. Patrick Köllner (GIGA vice president), Middle East academic Dr. André Bank, Africa academic Prof. Dr. Matthias Basedau, Latin America expert Prof. Dr. Sabine Kurtenbach and Head of Finance, Dr. Peter Peetz.

==International Networks==
The GIGA serves as the central coordinator of various academic networks.

The Institutions for Sustainable Peace (ISP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://isp.giga-hamburg.de/ Institutions for Sustainable Peace (ISP)]&lt;/ref&gt; network undertakes research on measures to promote peace in post-war societies with partners from Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, England and Germany.

The Land Matrix project&lt;ref&gt;[http://landmatrix.org/en/ Web Platform ''www.landmatrix.org'']&lt;/ref&gt; is an online platform that collects global data on large-scale land acquisitions. The GIGA maintains the platform and evaluates the data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/project/the-land-matrix The Research Project ''The Land Matrix'' at the GIGA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The academics in the Regional Powers Network (RPN)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/rpn Regional Powers Network]&lt;/ref&gt; are studying the global rise of the new regional powers. This is a joint project of the GIGA, the [[University of Oxford]] and [[Sciences Po]], Paris.

As of July 2014 the GIGA is coordinating the International Diffusion and Cooperation of Authoritarian Regimes (IDCAR) network,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giga-hamburg.de/de/project/international-diffusion-and-cooperation-of-authoritarian-regimes-idcar-network International Diffusion and Cooperation of Authoritarian Regimes (IDCAR-Network)]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of which it is investigating, together with 12 international research institutes, the influence of and cooperation between authoritarian regimes on the international stage.

==Publications==
The GIGA publishes three open access series: the GIGA Focus, the GIGA Working Papers, and the GIGA Journal Family.

* In the GIGA Focus series&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giga-hamburg.de/de/publikationen/giga-focus ''GIGA Focus'']&lt;/ref&gt; academics publish short analyses of current global events. The German editions comprise four different regional series (Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East) and the GIGA Focus Global, which covers comparative and global topics. Each edition is published 10 times per year. The GIGA also publishes the GIGA Focus International Edition in both English and Chinese.

The fossil, an adult female skull, is referred to as [[Gibraltar 1]] or the Gibraltar Skull ''(pictured at left)''. Neanderthals were unknown at the time that the fossil was found.

However, it wasn't until the early twentieth century{{when|date=July 2017}} that it was realized{{by whom|date=July 2017}} that Gibraltar 1 was the skull of a Neanderthal. If the skull's significance had been understood in the nineteenth century, Neanderthal Man would probably have been termed "Gibraltar Man".&lt;ref name=seven/&gt;&lt;ref name=geology/&gt;&lt;ref name=hominid/&gt;

==Discovery of Gibraltar 2==

{{History of Gibraltar}}
Additional evidence of Neanderthal occupation in Gibraltar was found at the Devil's Tower Mousterian rock shelter, also at the north face of the Rock of Gibraltar.&lt;ref name=geology/&gt;&lt;ref name=hominid/&gt;&lt;ref name=mousterian/&gt; Devil's Tower was a seventeenth century [[watchtower]] which was located at the eastern end of Devil's Tower Road.&lt;ref name=seven/&gt; The archaeological site was initially discovered by Abbé [[Henri Breuil|Henri Édouard Prosper Breuil]] (1877 &amp;ndash; 1961), who had recommended investigation. Breuil, a French [[paleontologist]] and archaeologist, is renowned for his expertise on prehistoric cave art.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

The excavations at the Devil's Tower cave started in November 1925 and continued until December 1926 in three phases. In 1926, the skull of a Neanderthal child was discovered by archaeologist [[Dorothy Garrod]].&lt;ref name=hominid/&gt;&lt;ref name=mousterian&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dorothy A.E.

She was the first female professor at both the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[University of Oxford]]. In addition, in 1939, Garrod was elected to the Disney Chair.&lt;ref name=biographies&gt;{{cite web|title=Biographies – Dorothy Annie Elizabeth Garrod, 1892–1968|url=http://www.newn.cam.ac.uk/about-newnham/college-history/biographies/content/dorothy-garrod|work=newn.cam.ac.uk|publisher=[[Newnham College]], [[University of Cambridge]]|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Garrod found five skull fragments which were described by the archaeologist and others in ''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'' in 1928. The five fragments were [[maxilla]]ry, [[parietal bone|parietal]], [[temporal bone|temporal]], [[cranium|cranial]], and [[mandible|mandibular]].&lt;ref name=mousterian/&gt;&lt;ref name=nespos/&gt;&lt;ref name=zurich&gt;{{cite web|title=Computer-Assisted Paleoanthropology|url=http://www.aim.uzh.ch/morpho/wiki//CAP/N3|work=aim.uzh.ch|publisher=University of Zurich|accessdate=12 October 2012|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mousterian [[flake tools|flake stone tools]] were found near the child's remains. The skull of the female{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Neanderthal child is known as Gibraltar 2 or Devil's Tower Child ''(pictured above)''.&lt;ref name=geology/&gt;&lt;ref name=hominid&gt;{{cite web|title=Hominid Hunting – The Rock of Gibraltar: Neanderthals' Last Refuge|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/hominids/2012/09/the-rock-of-gibraltar-neanderthals-last-refuge/|date=19 September 2012|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nespos&gt;{{cite web|title=Gibraltar 2|url=https://www.nespos.org/display/PublicNesposSpace/Devil's+Tower+-+individuum+(Gibraltar+2)|work=nespos.org|publisher=[[Nespos]]|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study described in 1993 in the ''[[Journal of Human Evolution]]'', the striation pattern of the [[tooth enamel|dental enamel]] of the Devil's Tower Child fossil was compared to that of modern [[hunter-gatherers]] and [[medieval]] individuals from [[Spain]]. It was found that the Devil's Tower Child had a more [[abrasive]] diet than medieval individuals. Gibraltar 2 had a high number of striations. Further, the ratio of horizontal to vertical striations suggested that Gibraltar 2 may have been primarily [[carnivorous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author2=Pérez-Pérez, A |title=The diet of the Neanderthal Child Gibraltar 2 (Devil's Tower) through the study of the vestibular striation pattern |journal=[[Journal of Human Evolution]] |date=January 1993 |volume=24 |issue=1 |author=Fox, C.

By 2008, the face of the Devil's Tower Child had been reconstructed ''(pictured below)'' at the [[University of Zurich]] by means of computer-assisted [[paleoanthropology]] (CAP). This involved using [[computed tomography]] (CT) to perform volume data acquisition of the five skull fragments unearthed by Garrod in 1926. The five cranial fragments were then transformed with the software FoRM-IT into virtual 3D images. With the five virtual images then suspended in anatomical space according to scientific criteria, the missing fragments were replaced with [[mirror images]] of the excavated fragments. By means of [[laser]] [[stereolithography]], the virtual reconstruction of the face and skull of the Devil's Tower Child was converted to a physical model. The soft tissues were then approximated using 3D Thin Plate Splining (TPS) with data from a modern child. [[Plasticine]] modelling clay was accordingly applied on the physical model to simulate soft tissue. The final model of Gibraltar 2 was then cast; finishing touches included paint and human hair ''(link to final image below)''.&lt;ref name=zurich/&gt;

==Earlier claims of Gibraltar as a refugium==
At the end of the 20th century, it was believed that the Neanderthals disappeared ''c.'' 35,000 years ago. In 2006, radiocarbon dating of charcoal from [[Gorham's Cave]], Gibraltar, suggested that Neanderthals survived in southern Spain and Gibraltar at least to 28,000 BP, well after the arrival of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' in Europe ''c.'' 45,000 years ago. More recently, new decontaminated radiocarbon dating (from the same Oxford laboratory that published the late date in 2006) suggests Neanderthals had vacated Gibraltar by 42,000 BP, earlier than elsewhere in Europe.

'''Gordon Music Learning Theory''' is a model for [[music education]] based on Edwin Gordon's research on musical aptitude and achievement in the greater field of [[music learning theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007) 3. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. Grunow, Music Learning Theory: A Catalyst for Change in Beginning Instrumental Music Instruction (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2005): 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is an explanation of music learning, based on audiation (see below) and students' individual musical differences. The theory uses the concepts of discrimination and inference learning to explain tonal, rhythmic, and harmonic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Gerhardstein: A Biographical and Historical Account of an American Music Educator and Researcher (diss., Temple U., 2001), 200–259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jere T. Humphreys, Music Learning Theory. Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. (Oxford University Press. Web. September 29, 2015 http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.A2267268&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audiation==
''Audiation'' is a term Gordon coined in 1975 to refer to comprehension and internal realization of music, or the sensation of an individual hearing or feeling sound when it is not physically present.&lt;ref name="Kratus 1994"&gt;Gerhardstein, R. C. (2002). The historical roots and development of audiation: A process for musical understanding. In Hanley, B. &amp; Goolsby, T.W. (Eds.) Musical understanding: Perspectives in theory and practice. [Canada] : Canadian Music Educators Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians previously used terms such as ''aural perception'' or ''aural imagery'' to describe this concept, though ''aural imagery'' would imply a notational component while audiation does not necessarily do so.&lt;ref name="Jordan 1987"&gt;James M. Jordan, "The Pedagogy of Choral Intonation: Efficient Pedagogy to Approach an Old Problem," ''The Choral Journal'' Vol. 27, No. 9 (1987): 9–13, 15–16. https://www.jstor.org/stable/23547288&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon suggests that "audiation is to music what thought is to language."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Azzara, Audiation, Improvisation, and Music Learning Theory. (1991, The Quarterly, 2(1–2), 106–109.&lt;/ref&gt; His research is based on similarities between how individuals learn a language and how they learn to make and understand music.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Rhythm: Contrasting the Implications of Audiation and Notation (Chicago: GIA Publications, 2000): 111. {{ISBN|1579990983}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon specifies that audiation potential is an element of music aptitude, arguing that to demonstrate music aptitude one must use audiation.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, All About Audiation and Music Aptitudes (September 1999, Music Educators Journal)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audiation and language===
Gordon describes that audiation occurs when an individual is "listening to, recalling, performing, interpreting, creating, improvising, reading, or writing music."&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007) 3. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiation while listening to music, he describes, is analogous to the simultaneous translation of languages, giving meaning to sound and music based on individual knowledge and experience.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007) 4–5. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon also emphasizes that music itself is not a language as it has no words or grammar, but rather has syntax, an "orderly arrangement of sounds, and context." &lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007) 5. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of audiation===
Gordon differentiates different varieties of audiation and categorizes them into 8 types and 6 stages.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007) 15. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Type 1, Listening to familiar or unfamiliar music.
*Type 2, Reading familiar or unfamiliar music.
*Type 3, Writing familiar or unfamiliar music from dictation.
*Type 4, Recalling and performing familiar music from memory.
*Type 5, Recalling and writing familiar music from memory.
*Type 6, Creating and improvising unfamiliar music while performing or in silence.
*Type 7, Creating and improvising unfamiliar music while reading.
*Type 8, Creating and improvising unfamiliar music while writing.

===Stages of audiation===
In addition to outlining types of audiation, Gordon also differentiates between stages of audiation 
&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007) 20. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Stage 1 Momentary retention
*Stage 2 Imitating and audiating tonal patterns and rhythm patterns and recognizing and identifying a tonal center and macrobeats
*Stage 3 Establishing objective or subjective tonality and meter
*Stage 4 Retaining in audiation tonal patterns and rhythm patterns that have been organized
*Stage 5 Recalling tonal patterns and rhythm patterns organized and audiated in other pieces of music
*Stage 6 Anticipating and predicting tonal patterns and rhythm processes

==Learning sequences==
To describe how students learn music, Gordon outlines two main categories of learning based on his research on audiation: discrimination learning and inference learning.&lt;ref name = "GordonLSiM 101"&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007): 101. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Discrimination learning===
Discrimination learning is defined as the ability to determine whether two elements are same or not the same.  Gordon describes five sequential levels of discrimination: aural/oral, verbal association, partial synthesis, symbolic association, and composite synthesis.
====Aural/oral====
Gordon describes that the most basic type of discrimination being aural/oral, where students hear tonal and rhythm patterns and imitate by singing, moving, and chanting patterns back to the instructor. Students listen in the aural portion of discrimination learning, while performing represents the oral portion. At this stage, students use neutral syllables to perform tonal and rhythm patterns.
====Verbal association====
After students are more able to audiate and perform basic rhythm and tonal patterns and become comfortable with imitating songs and chants in introduced tonalities and meters, Gordon explains the next step is verbal association, where contextual meaning is given to what the students are audiating and imitating through tonal or rhythm syllables (such as [[solfege]] or the names of concepts students may be audiating through tonal patterns such as [[tonic (music)|tonic]] and [[dominant (music)|dominant]]).&lt;ref name = "GordonLSiM-106-107"&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007): 106–107. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Partial synthesis====
At both aural/oral and the verbal association level, students identify familiar tonal and rhythm patterns performed on neutral syllables by their verbal association.
====Symbolic association====
Symbolic association is the point at which students are introduced to notation, learning to associate written symbols and notation describing familiar tonal and rhythm patterns that had been introduced in the aural/oral and verbal association level of the skill learning sequence. &lt;ref name = "GordonLSiM-122-130"&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007): 122–130. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Composite synthesis====
At the composite synthesis level, students give context to familiar tonal or rhythm patterns by reading and writing them and identifying their tonality or meter as introduced in the symbolic association stage.&lt;ref name = "GordonLSiM-130-133"&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007): 130–133. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Inference learning===
At the inference learning level, students take an active role in their own education and learn to identify, create, and improvise ''unfamiliar'' patterns. Similar to discrimination learning, Gordon delineates separate categories of inference learning that students logically follow in the course of music learning: generalization, creativity/improvisation, and theoretical understanding.
====Generalization====
As aural/oral learning is the most basic element of discrimination learning, generalization is the basic element of inference learning. Generalization consists aural/oral learning, verbal learning, symbolic reading, and writing. At the generalization level of learning, students may listen to sets of familiar and unfamiliar tonal or rhythmic patterns and determine whether the patterns are the same or different, ultimately reading familiar and unfamiliar patterns, as well. &lt;ref name = "GordonLSiM-137-140"&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007): 137–140. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Creativity/improvisation====
The creativity/improvisation level of the above learning sequences has aural/oral and symbolic levels. At the aural/oral level, teachers present familiar or unfamiliar patterns and have students respond with patterns of their own, first on neutral syllables and later with the  verbal association. At the symbolic level, students learn to recognize and sing patterns within written chord symbols, as well as learn to write their own responses to tonal patterns and rhythm patterns.&lt;ref name = "GordonLSiM-141-145"&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007): 141–145. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Theoretical understanding====
The final level of inference learning is theoretical understanding, in which students gain further understanding of music theory concepts in aural/oral, verbal, and symbolic contexts. Students may learn concepts such as pitch letter-names, intervals, key-signature names, or concepts such as [[cadence (music)|cadences]] and learn to recognize and perform patterns that apply such concepts.&lt;ref name = "GordonLSiM-145-150"&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007): 145–150. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jump right in==
Jump Right In is an instrumental methods book with accompanying teacher editions that applies Gordon's music learning theory, co-written by [[Eastman School of Music]] music education faculty Richard F. Grunow and Christopher D Azzara alongside Gordon. The series of Winds and Percussion was first published in 1989–90, three years after the recorder edition.&lt;ref name = "JRI 3"&gt;Christopher D. Azzara, Edwin E, and Gordon, Richard F. Grunow. Jump Right In: the instrumental series teacher's guide book one and two, revised edition. (Chicago, IL: GIA Publications, Inc., 2001) 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection also includes a strings methods edition.

==Gordon music learning theory and music aptitude==
Gordon's music learning theory is based on his research on music aptitude in line with cognitive theories regarding the organization of incoming stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Cutietta, Edwin Gordon's Impact on the Field of Music Aptitude (Fall 1991: Philosophy in Music Education, Volume II, Number 1 &amp; 2): 73&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon's research suggests that music aptitude is [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] in the general population similar to intellectual aptitude.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Cutietta, Edwin Gordon's Impact on the Field of Music Aptitude (Fall 1991: Philosophy in Music Education, Volume II, Number 1 &amp; 2): 74&lt;/ref&gt; His research also suggests that music aptitude that a child is born with can only be maintained with repeated positive exposure to musical experiences soon after (or even before) birth, up until approximately age 9 where a child reaches "stabilized" music aptitude.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Cutietta, Edwin Gordon's Impact on the Field of Music Aptitude (Fall 1991: Philosophy in Music Education, Volume II, Number 1 &amp; 2): 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1920s and 30s heralded the creation of aptitude and achievement tests by [[Carl Seashore]], [[E. Thayer Gaston]], H.D. Wing, Arnold Bentley, and Edwin Gordon in an effort to identify students who were most likely to benefit from private instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Colwell, et al. "Music education." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed September 29, 2015, http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.A2267268&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon created a number of tests to determine music aptitude for various age groups; he developed his first music aptitude test, the ''Musical Aptitude Profile'', in 1965 for children in 4th to 12th grade. Later tests include ''Primary Measures of Music Audiation'' (PMMA), published in 1979 for children ages 5 to 8, ''Intermediate Measures of Music Audiation''(IMMA) for children ages 6 to 9,&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Intermediate Measures of music audiation.(Chicago: G.I.A. Publications, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Audie''&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Audie: A game for understanding and analyzing your child's music potential. (Chicago: G.I.A. Publications, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; for children ages 3 to 4.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Cutietta, Edwin Gordon's Impact on the Field of Music Aptitude (Fall 1991: Philosophy in Music Education, Volume II, Number 1 &amp; 2): 73&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon describes that these tests of musical aptitude are meant to allow teachers to adapt their instruction to individual students' needs and to target students with high musical aptitude who may not otherwise be receiving advanced musical instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, All About Audiation and Music Aptitudes (September 1999, Music Educators Journal) 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the theory==
Criticisms of music learning theory include Paul Woodford's concerns that the theory itself is a misnomer, and rather than a learning theory it is a "taxonomy of musical preconditions for critical thinking",&lt;ref name = "Woodford 1996"&gt;Paul G. Woodford, Evaluating Edwin Gordon's Music Learning Theory from a Critical Thinking Perspective. (Philosophy of Music Education Review 4, no. 2: Fall 1996): 83–95&lt;/ref&gt; and that "rather than overwhelming younger students in the beginning stages of instruction by focusing only on the complexities of music, teachers should use approaches such as Gordon's along with Kodaly, Orff, and other methodologies, to help students master basic musical skills and knowledge that are prerequisites to more independent kinds of thinking."&lt;ref name = "Gordon Responds 1997"&gt;Edwin Gordon, "Edwin Gordon Responds," ''Philosophy of Music Education Review'', Vol. 5, No. 1 (1997): 57–58. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40495414&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordon responded to these claims, arguing that Woodford misunderstood elements of Gordon's methodology, erroneously associating Gordon with "clapping of rhythms", as well as misunderstanding the difference between chronological and musical age, the difference explaining why tonal and rhythm patterns should be taught independently in order to create a foundation for "complex cognition and independent musical thinking that relates to larger musical forms".&lt;ref name = "Gordon Responds 1997"/&gt; Gordon also agrees with Woodford's comment that Gordon's approach should be taught alongside other methodologies, also asserting that he agrees with Woodford's suggestion that "students should be introduced to the full range of real-life kinds of musical thinking including less conventional, and even atypical, musical practices."&lt;ref name = "Gordon Responds 1997"/&gt;

Similar criticisms include accusations that Gordon's skills-based programs of applying Music Learning Theory are "probably too narrow and limited in scope to provide students access to the diversity of musical belief systems, practices, and groups that exist", a concern of writer Paul G.

In [[pathology]], '''grading''' is a measure of the cell appearance in [[tumor]]s and other [[neoplasm]]s.  Some pathology grading systems apply only to [[malignant]] neoplasms ([[cancer]]); others apply also to [[benign]] neoplasms. The '''neoplastic grading''' is a measure of cell [[anaplasia]] (reversion of [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]]) in the sampled tumor and is based on the resemblance of the tumor to the tissue of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abrams|first=Gerald|title=Neoplasia II|url=http://open.umich.edu/education/med/m1/patientspop-genetics/fall2008/materials|accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grading in cancer is distinguished from [[cancer staging|staging]], which is a measure of the extent to which the cancer has [[metastasis|spread]].

Pathology grading systems classify the microscopic cell appearance abnormality and deviations in their rate of growth with the goal of predicting developments at tissue level (see also the 4 major histological changes in [[dysplasia]]).

Cancer is a disorder of '''[[cell cycle|cell life cycle]] alteration''' that leads (non-trivially) to excessive [[cell proliferation]] rates, typically longer cell lifespans and poor differentiation. The grade score (numerical: G1 up to G4) increases with the lack of cellular differentiation - it reflects how much the tumor cells differ from the cells of the normal tissue they have originated from (see [[Grading (tumors)#Categories|'Categories']] below).  Tumors may be graded on four-tier, three-tier, or two-tier scales, depending on the institution and the tumor type.

The [[histology|histologic]] tumor grade score along with the [[metastasis|metastatic]] (whole-body-level cancer-spread) staging are used to evaluate each specific cancer patient, develop their individual treatment strategy and to predict their prognosis.  A cancer that is very poorly differentiated is called ''[[anaplastic]]''.

==Categories==
Grading systems are also different for many common types of cancer, though following a similar pattern with grades being increasingly malignant over a range of 1 to 4. If no specific system is used, the following general grades are most commonly used, and recommended by the American Joint Commission on Cancer and other bodies:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Detection/tumor-grade National Cancer Institute, "Tumor Grade", accessed 18 August, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

*GX                Grade cannot be assessed
*G1                Well differentiated (Low grade)
*G2                Moderately differentiated (Intermediate grade)
*G3                Poorly differentiated (High grade)
*G4                Undifferentiated (High grade)

The '''Harish-Chandra Research Institute (HRI)''' is an institution dedicated to research in [[Mathematics]] and [[Theoretical Physics]], located in [[Allahabad]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[India]].&lt;ref name=hri-home&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.res.in/|title=Home|publisher=Harish-Chandra Research Institute|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1965, HRI offers a doctoral program in affiliation with the [[Homi Bhabha National Institute]].

HRI has a residential campus in [[Jhusi]] town near Allahabad on the banks of the River [[Ganges]]. The institute has over 30 faculty, 50 doctoral students and 25 post-doctoral visiting research fellows and scientists. HRI is funded by the [[Department of Atomic Energy (India)|Department of Atomic Energy]] (DAE) of the [[Government of India]].

==History==
The institute was founded as the '''Mehta Research Institute''' of Mathematics and Mathematical Physics in 1965, with an endowment from the ''B.S. Mehta Trust'', [[Calcutta]]. The institute was initially managed by Prof. Badri Nath Prasad and following his death in January 1966 by Prof. S.R. Sinha, both from the [[Allahabad University]]. The first official Director of the Institute was Prof. [[Prabhu Lal Bhatnagar]] in 1975 when it became truly operational. He was followed by Prof. S.R. Sinha again.&lt;ref name=hri-history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.res.in/hri_history.html|title=History|publisher=Harish-Chandra Research Institute|accessdate=2012-06-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130218024946/http://www.hri.res.in/hri_history.html|archivedate=18 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On  29 November 1975 [http://bdacharya.thescientificindian.com Dr. B. Devadas Acharya] joined the Mehta Research Institute (MRI) as its first Post-Doctoral Fellow and on 1 January 1980 was appointed as the first Assistant Professor of Mathematics at MRI.

Prof. [[Sharadchandra Shankar Shrikhande]] joined the Institute as its Director in January 1983. The institute was facing financial difficulties, and Prof Shrikhande sought DAE support for the institute. Following the recommendations of the DAE review committee, the [[Government of Uttar Pradesh]] committed to provide a campus for HRI, while the DAE committed to provide full funding for all operational expenses.&lt;ref name="hri-history" /&gt;

In January 1990, the Institute was granted about {{convert|66|acre|m2}} in [[Jhusi]] town of [[Allahabad district]] and Prof. H.S. Mani took over as Director. The institute moved to its present campus in 1996. Since then, the institute has grown in facilities, scope of research as well as number of faculty and students.

In October 2000, the institute was renamed in honor of renowned Indian mathematician, [[Harish-Chandra]].

Prof. [[Ravi S. Kulkarni]] succeeded Prof. Mani as the director in August 2001 and was followed by Prof. [[Amitava Raychaudhuri]] in July 2005. Prof. Jayanta Kumar Bhattacharjee followed in May 2011.&lt;ref name=hri-ar2011/&gt;

==Research activities==
The HRI Mathematics research group has four teams with focus on [[Algebra]], [[Harmonic analysis|Analysis]], [[Topology|Geometry &amp; Topology]] and [[Number Theory]].&lt;ref name=hri-math-research&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.res.in/~math/math_research.html|title=Mathematics Research at HRI|publisher=Harish-Chandra Research Institute|accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HRI Physics research group consists of teams focused on [[Astrophysics]], [[Condensed Matter Physics]], [[High Energy Physics]], [[String Theory]] and [[Quantum Information|Quantum Information &amp; Computation]].&lt;ref name=hri-physics-research&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.res.in/~physics/phys_research.html|title=Physics Research at HRI|publisher=Harish-Chandra Research Institute|accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent HRI faculty members in the area of String Theory include [[Ashoke Sen]] and [[Rajesh Gopakumar]].&lt;ref name=hindu-stringing&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hindu.com/2001/01/07/stories/0207000o.htm|title=Stringing together the ultimate law|publisher=The Hindu|date=2001-01-07|accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HRI faculty member in the area of Quantum Information and Computation includes [[Arun K.

The form of [[home automation]] focuses on making it possible for [[old age|older adults]] and people with [[disability|disabilities]] to remain at home, safe and comfortable. Home automation is becoming a viable option for older adults and people with disabilities who would prefer to stay in the comfort of their homes rather than move to a healthcare facility. This field uses much of the same technology and equipment as home automation for security, entertainment, and energy conservation but tailors it towards older adults and people with disabilities.

== Concept ==
There are two basic forms of home automation systems for the elderly: ''embedded health systems'' and ''private health networks''.  Embedded health systems integrate sensors and microprocessors in appliances, furniture, and clothing which collect data that is analyzed and can be used to diagnose diseases and recognize risk patterns.  Private health networks implement wireless technology to connect portable devices and store data in a household health database.  Due to the need for more healthcare options for the aging population "there is a significant interest from industry and policy makers in developing these technologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eriksson|first=Henrik|last2=Timpka|first2=Toomas|date=2002-06-01|title=The potential of smart homes for injury prevention among the elderly|journal=Injury Control and Safety Promotion|volume=9|issue=2|pages=127–131|doi=10.1076/icsp.9.2.127.8694|issn=1566-0974|pmid=12461840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
Home automation is being implemented into more and more homes of older adults and people with disabilities in order to maintain their independence and safety.  These smart homes allow older adults and people with disabilities to stay in their homes where they feel comfortable, instead of moving to a costly health care facility.  The transition to a health care facility can cause a lot of anxiety and home automation can either prevent or delay this anxiety.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheek|first=Penny|last2=Nikpour|first2=Linda|last3=Nowlin|first3=Heather|date=2005|title=Aging Well With Smart Technology|url=http://journals.lww.com/naqjournal/Abstract/2005/10000/Aging_Well_With_Smart_Technology.7.aspx|journal=Nursing Administration Quarterly|volume=29|issue=4|pages=329–338|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the disabled smart homes give them opportunity for independence, which will help them gain confidence and determination.  Smart homes can provide both older adults and people with disabilities with many different types of emergency assistance systems, security features, fall prevention, automated timers, and alerts.  These systems allow for the individual to feel secure in their homes knowing that help is only minutes away.  Smart home systems will make it possible for family members to monitor their loved ones from anywhere with an internet connection.

== Telehealth implementation ==

=== Background ===
[[Telehealth]] is the use of electronic technology services to provide patient care and improve the healthcare delivery system. The term is often confused with [[telemedicine]], which specifically involves remote clinical services of healthcare delivery. Telehealth is the delivery of remote clinical and non-clinical services of [[healthcare delivery]]. Telehealth promotes the diagnosis, treatment, education, and self-management away from health care providers and into people’s homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SD State Law Telemedicine/Telehealth Definition|url=http://www.cchpca.org/sd-state-law-telemedicinetelehealth-definition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reasons for implementation ===
The goal of telehealth is to complement the traditional healthcare setting. There is an increased demand on the healthcare system from a growing elderly population and shortage of healthcare providers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koch|first=Sabine|date=August 2006|title=Home telehealth- Current state and future trends|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505605001887|journal= International Journal of Medical Informatics|volume=75|issue=8|pages=565–576|via=|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2005.09.002|pmid=16298545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many elderly and disabled patients are faced with limited access to health care and providers. Telehealth may bridge the gap between patient demand and healthcare accessibility.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Telehealth may also decrease healthcare costs and mitigate transportation concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wade|first=Victoria A.|last2=Karen|first2=Jonathan|date=August 10, 2010|title=A systematic review of economic analyses of telehealth services using real time video communication|journal=BMC Health Services Research|volume=10|pages=233|doi=10.1186/1472-6963-10-233|pmid=20696073|pmc=2927589}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the elderly and disabled populations, telehealth would allow them to stay in the comfort and convenience of their homes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Elderly population ===
[[Geriatrics]] is the role of healthcare in providing care to the elderly population. The elderly population involves many health complications. According to the National Institute of Health, “the main threats are non-communicable diseases, including heart, stroke, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and dementia”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merrell|first1=Ronald C.|date=October 31, 2015|title=Geriatric Telemedicine: Background and Evidence for Telemedicine as a Way to Address the Challenges of Geriatrics|pmc=4659878|journal=National Center for Biotechnology Information|volume=21 |issue=4|pages=223–229|doi=10.4258/hir.2015.21.4.223|pmid=26618027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telehealth may help provide management and monitoring of chronic disease in patient homes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One telemonitoring device measures vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation, and weight.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another telemonitoring device is video-conferencing, which can provide patient-provider consultation and electronic delivery of medication instructions and general health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van den Berg|first=Neeltje|date=October 2012|title=Telemedicine and telecare for older patients—A systematic review|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378512212002277|journal= Maturitas|volume=73|issue=2|pages=94–114|via=|doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2012.06.010|pmid=22809497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have been done to analyze the effectiveness of telehealth on the elderly population. Some have found positive telehealth effects including reduction of symptoms and self-efficacy in the elderly population with chronic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gellis|first=Avi D.|date=January 11, 2012|title=Outcomes of a Telehealth Intervention for Homebound Older Adults With Heart or Chronic Respiratory Failure: A Randomized Controlled Trial|url=https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/52/4/541/642861|journal=The Gerontologist|volume=52|pages=541–552|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found the opposite effect, where telehealth home care produced greater mortality than the traditional hospital setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takahashi|first=Paul Y.|date=May 28, 2012|title=A Randomized Controlled Trial of Telemonitoring in Older Adults With Multiple Health Issues to Prevent Hospitalizations and Emergency Department Visits|url=https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/52/4/541/642861|journal=JAMA Network|volume=172|pages=773–779|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then there are other studies that have found inconclusive results.

=== Disabled population ===
Persons with severe functional disabilities are statistically the highest users of all health care services and represent a large portion of health care costs and designated service.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forducey|first=Pamela G.|date=May 2012|title=Telehealth for Persons with Severe Functional Disabilities and their Caregivers: Facilitating Self-care Management in the Home Setting|pmc=3375593|journal=National Center for Biotechnology Information|volume=9|issue=2|pages=144–162|via=|pmid=22662729|doi=10.1037/a0028112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disabled population requires many self-monitoring and self-management strategies that place a strenuous burden on healthcare providers. Telecommunications technologies may provide a way to meet the healthcare demands of the disabled population. According to the National Institutes of Health, “the largest proportion of health care… result from individuals with severe functional disabilities, such as stroke and traumatic brain injury”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Patients with functional disabilities may benefit from telehealth care. According to the World Health Organization, functional limitation refers to the physical or mental conditions, which impair, interfere with, or impede one or more of the individual’s major life activities and instrumental activities of daily living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Win|first=Aung Zaw|date=April 1, 2015|title=Telehealth Can Bridge the Gap for Rural, Disabled, and Elderly Patients|url=http://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(15)00078-X/abstract|journal=The Journal of Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine|volume=16|pages=268–269|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients suffering from spina bifida, musculoskeletal disorders, mental illness, or neurological disorders may also benefit from telehealth care services.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Telehealth technologies include vital sign telemonitoring devices, exercise routines, problem-solving assessments, and therapeutic self-care management tasks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Telehealth care, however, is not sufficient in complete care but rather a supplement of separate care.

=== Ethical concerns ===
Concerns of telehealth implementation include the limited scope of research that confirm conclusive benefits of telehealth in comparison to the healthcare setting. Currently there is no definitive conclusion that telehealth is the superior mode of healthcare delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Bonnie|last2=Litewka|first2=Sergio|date=October 2008|title=Ethical Challenges of Telemedicine and Telehealth|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-quarterly-of-healthcare-ethics/article/ethical-challenges-of-telemedicine-and-telehealth/5D777B4EDE6E97934FB4B442F9CE0B33|journal=Cambridge Core|volume=17|pages=401–416|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also ethical issues about patient autonomy and patient acceptance of telehealth as a mode of healthcare. Lack of face-to-face patient-provider care in contrast to direct care in a traditional healthcare setting is an ethical concern for many.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/news/telehealth-balance-between-access-and-ethics?page=0,7|title=Telehealth: The balance between access and ethics|last=Worth|first=Tammy|date=December 10, 2015|website=Medical Economics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Teladoc v. Texas Medical Board ====
Prior to the court case, [[Teladoc]] v. [[Texas Medical Board]], the Texas Medical Board upheld the requirement that physicians must hold in-person, patient examinations only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/regulatory/teladoc-texas-medical-board-telehealth-licensing-regulations-state-law|title=Teladoc drops lawsuit against Texas Medical Board following amended telemedicine regulations|last=Sweeney|first=Evan|date=December 4, 2017|website=Fierce Healthcare|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 15, 2017, the Texas Medical Board amended its regulations to allow state-licensed healthcare providers to care for patients without required face-to-face interaction.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170918/NEWS/170919904|title=Texas Medical Board releases telemedicine rules|last=Arndt|first=Rachel Z.|date=September 18, 2017|website=Modern Healthcare|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amended rules could affect up to 28 million patients in the state of Texas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Systems ==
Home automation for healthcare can range from very simple alerts to lavish computer controlled network interfaces.  Some of the monitoring or safety devices that can be installed in a home include lighting and motion sensors, environmental controls, video cameras, automated timers, emergency assistance systems, and alerts.

== Security ==
In order to maintain the security of the home many home automation systems integrate features such as remote keyless entry systems which will allow seniors to view who is at the door and then remotely open the door.  Home networks can also be programmed to automatically lock doors and shut blinds in order to maintain privacy.

== Emergency assistance systems and tools ==
Emergency assistance for older adults and people with disabilities can be classified into three categories: First, Second, and Third Generation emergency assistance systems or tools.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Celler|first=Branko G.|last2=Lovell|first2=Nigel H.|date=1999-11-15|title=The potential impact of home telecare on clinical practice|url=https://www.mja.com.au/journal/1999/171/10/potential-impact-home-telecare-clinical-practice|journal=The Medical Journal of Australia|volume=171|issue=10|pages=518–521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First generation ===
These simple systems and tools include personal alarm systems and emergency response telephones that do not have to be integrated into a smart home system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A typical system consists of a small wireless pendant transceiver to be worn around the neck or wrist.  The system has a central unit plugged into a telephone jack, with a loudspeaker and microphone. When the pendant is activated a 24-hour control center is contacted.
Generally the 24 hour control center speaks to the user and identifies that help is required e.g. Emergency services are dispatched. The control center also has information of the user, e.g. medical symptoms, medication allergies, etc. The unit has a built in rechargeable battery backup and the ability to notify the control center if the battery is running low or if the system loses power. Modern systems have active wireless pendants that are polled frequently advising battery, and signal strength status as older style pendant could have a battery that has failed rendering the pendant useless when required in an emergency.

=== Second generation ===
These systems and tools generate alarms and alerts automatically if significant changes are observed in the user's vital signs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  These systems are usually fully integrated into a home network and allow health professionals to monitor patients at home. The system consists of an antenna that a patient holds over their implanted cardiac device to transmit data for downloading over the telephone line and viewing by the patient’s physician.  The collected data can be accessed by the patient or family members.  Another example of this type of system is a [[Smart Shirt]] that measures heart rate, electrocardiogram results, respiration, temperature and other vital functions and alerts the patient or physician if there is a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gtwm.gatech.edu/|title=Georgia Tech Wearable Motherboard|website=www.gtwm.gatech.edu|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third generation ===
These types of systems would help older adults and people with disabilities deal with loneliness and depression by connecting them with other elderly or disabled individuals through the Internet, reducing their sense of isolation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Reminder systems ==
Home automation systems may include automatic reminder systems for the elderly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Such systems are connected to the Internet and make announcements over an intercom.  They can prompt about doctor's appointments and taking medicine, as well as everyday activities such as turning off the stove, closing the blinds, locking doors, etc.  Users choose what activities to be reminded of.  The system can be set up to automatically perform tasks based on user activity, such as turning on the lights or adjusting room temperature when the user enters specified areas. Other systems can remind users at home or away from home to take their medicine, and how much, by using an alarm wristwatch with text message and medical alert.  Reminder systems can also remind about everyday tasks such as eating lunch or walking the dog.

Some communities offer free telephone reassurance services&lt;ref name="Care3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garlandcountysheriff.com/programs/seniorcare.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010051803/http://www.garlandcountysheriff.com/programs/seniorcare.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-10-10 |title=Senior Care and Safety Check |publisher=Garland County Sheriff's Department |accessdate=2007-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to residents, which includes both safety check calls as well as reminders.  These services have been credited with saving the lives of many elderly and senior citizens who choose to remain at home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sheriff.fairfield.oh.us/subpages/programservices/care.aspx Fairfield County Sheriff's Office CARE! (Call Reassurance Program)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medication dispensing and spoon-feeding ==

Smart homes can implement [[Remote dispensing|medication dispensing devices]] in order to ensure that necessary medications are taken at appropriate times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Automated [[pill dispenser]]s can dispense only the pills that are to be taken at that time and are locked; versions are available for Alzheimer's patients that have a lock on them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For diabetic patients a talking glucose monitor allows the patient to check their blood sugar level and take the appropriate injection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Digital [[thermometer]]s are able to recognize a fever and alert physicians.  [[Blood pressure]] and [[pulse]] monitors dispense [[hypertensive]] [[medication]]s when needed.

There are also [[wiktionary:spoon-feed|spoon-feeding]] robots.

== Home robotics ==
[[Domestic robot]]s, connected to the domotic network, are included to perform or help in [[household chores]] for example: [[Rotimatic]] which makes rotis, tortillas and puris from scratch. Dedicated robots included robots helping to administer medications and alerting a remote caregiver if the patient is about to miss his or her medicine dose (oral or no-oral medications).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Challenges ==
The recent advances made in tailoring home automation toward the elderly have generated opposition.  It has been stated that "Smart home technology will be helpful only if it is tailored to meet the individual needs of each patient".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This currently creates a problem because many of the interfaces designed for home automation "are not designed to take functional limitations, associated with age, into consideration".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Another problem that has been presented involves making the system [[user-friendly]] for the elderly who often have difficulty operating electronic devices.  The cost of the systems has also presented a challenge, because although the systems would be cheaper than the costs of a long-term health care facility, the U.S. government currently provides no assistance to seniors who choose to install these systems (in some countries such as Spain the Dependency Law includes this assistance).

The biggest concern expressed by potential users of smart home technology is "fear of lack of human responders or the possible replacement of human caregivers by technology",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but home automation should be seen as something that augments, but does not replace, human care.

[[File:IfU Logo.jpg|right|thumb|400px]]
'''''Institut für Unternehmenskybernetik''''' (abbreviated '''''IfU'''''), is a German research institution dedicated to advancing the study of [[Entrepreneurial cybernetics]] and [[management cybernetics]], founded in 1988 and located in [[Aachen]], Germany.

== Overview ==
[[File:rwth.png|left|thumb|200px]]
The IfU is a widely dispersed networked institute, composed of members from exceedingly differentiated disciplines. As an affiliated institute of the [[RWTH Aachen University]] since 2003, the IfU is in constant contact with numerous other institutes associated with the university (e.g. Textile Technologies, the Research Institute for Rationalisation, and the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology). Moreover, the IfU is a member association of the AiF (German Federation of Industrial Research Associations), representing the 'management cybernetics' sector, and is therefore a contact partner for many interdisciplinary research projects. As an application orientated research institute, the IfU has been developing methods and tools specifically designed to fit the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises since 1988. In doing so it pursues the principal ‘out of the practice for the practice’ with an inductive research paradigm:{{clarify|date=June 2013}}

:''"In interdisciplinary research projects we seek to develop practical solutions with the aid of our research partners.  These solutions will be implemented and evaluated in all enterprises concerned.  The theories of [[Stafford Beer]], [[Frederic Vester]], [[Fredmund Malik]], [[Klaus Henning]] as well as [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] (amongst others) form the scientific bases of our work."''

== Entrepreneurial Cybernetics ==
Introducing the institute, IfU focuses on the interaction between people, technology and organisations taking place within small to medium-sized enterprises. The Institute for Management of Cybernetics regards businesses as living systems, which convert information and resources into products or services through a series of compound processes. As a practice orientated and interdisciplinary science, the IfU aims to optimize these business processes by means of development and publishing of scientifically proven methods. The procedures implemented are always based on cybernetic principles- and in particular on the idea of a control loop, or feedback. This means that internal business processes are not straightforward input-output relationships but are constantly being influenced and changed by their own outcomes, i.e. they are recursive. Such a principal can have both aiding and debilitating effects but the IfU aims to help businesses implement and use it profitably.

Being able to recognise enterprises as open, socio-technological, economic, multifaceted and networked systems, the IfU helps to describe and explain the complex phenomena which occur within these contexts.

== Cooperation ==

The Institute for Management Cybernetics e.V. (IfU) forms an institute cluster with the Center for Learning and Knowledge Management and the Department of Information Management in Mechanical Engineering at the RWTH Aachen University.

== Areas of Expertise; introducing projects carried out by IfU ==

The IfU carried out projects in several areas of expertise; these cover cost-effectiveness, micro and start-up enterprises, co-operations processes and change management and are explained below in more detail.

===Cost Effectiveness===

When estimating cost-effectiveness, the IfU places emphasis on both hard factors (e.g. costs, time) and soft factors (e.g. employee motivation and the communication culture) in its approach to economic appraisal. Following this initiative, an extensive overview of a business can be achieved. The NOWS technique (use-orientated cost-effectiveness evaluation) is one of the main software tools developed by IfU, as a means of helping enterprises make a profitability analysis. Because falsely estimated investments can steer companies towards crisis situations, it is very important that every decision maker considers all factors before making an investment. The software tool creates a graph based on all the factors integrated into the system, and as a result presents the enterprises with the best possible option of investment. Diverse aspects are considered in the analysis, leaving little to no room for insecurities; a stable investment scenario is presented.

Consequently, several projects profited from this method; NowBITs - investments in computing services were valued and a code of practice was compiled. AutoPreforms - the efficient manufacture of fibre reinforced composites in the car industry.

===Micro and start-up enterprises===

For over ten years, the IfU has been aiming to find solutions in helping micro and start-up enterprises with the management of resources. Once the start-up incentives have phased-out, many young businesses reach a critical stage which is marked by a high number of bankruptcies. The reasons for failure of young businesses are multifaceted but are often associated with lack of experience. An exemplary undertaking is the Jungunternehmen Project - a method map was developed to provide the enterprises that reach this critical stage with the necessary support.

===Co-operation Processes===

Additionally, with the intent to help enterprises use limited resources more efficiently by converting relevant information into applicable knowledge, the IfU researches success factors in co-operations processes and co-ordinates corresponding joint projects. To illustrate the work carried out in this field, in project SENEKA (Service networks for Education and Further Education ) the IfU has co-ordinated the cross-sectional task of innovation management.

===Change Management===

As stipulated previously, the IfU carried out several projects in the field of change management to help organisations adapt to the fluctuating market conditions. CuBa Change is one of the newer developments. The project’s objective is to develop a practical and easy process of quality-orientated safeguard and adoption of Changes Processes for SMEs, whilst abiding by the more fundamental features of corporate culture. In this way a management-specific situational analysis of Change-Proposals will be enabled, increasing the likelihood of success and the ability to cope with the constant need to adapt to change.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4065">The '''International Program in Conflict Resolution and Mediation''' is an interdisciplinary English-language [[master's degree]] program offered at [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[Israel]].  

== History ==
The International Program in Conflict Resolution and Mediation, founded in October 2009, teaches students from around the world the fundamentals of conflict resolution.&lt;ref name="References"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/studying-conflict-resolution-living-the-conflict-1.364744 'Studying conflict resolution, living the conflict', Profile of the International Program, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Consisting of three consecutive semesters, the International Program aims to provide students with the insight and skills needed to address the assessment, management, and resolution of conflicts in the international arena.

The first semester exposes students to a comprehensive survey of conflicts and their resolution from diverse perspectives, including international law, psychology, political science, anthropology and economics. The second and third semesters gives students the chance to choose from a variety of courses according to their interests. Throughout the semesters, special focus is placed on combining practical experience to the theoretical knowledge through interactive teaching, culminating in the intensive mediation workshop taught in smaller groups and through simulations.

Academic trips are planned throughout the year, visiting various sites around Israel in conjunction with the curriculum. In addition, speakers from the United Nations, the [[Israeli Foreign Ministry]], embassies, NGOs and visiting professors are invited each week to share their experiences and research, and provide students with professional networking opportunities.

Courses reflect the relevant in the field of conflict resolution, in addition to the resources in Israel and the Middle East: core courses on Middle East History and Israeli politics; framing coursework to focus on international approaches; and offering a greater variety of interdisciplinary elective courses.

Courses are taught in the afternoon, four days per week, allowing students to pursue volunteering and internship opportunities, as well as language courses in [[Hebrew]] and colloquial [[Arabic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4191">The '''International Society of Developmental Biologists''', or '''ISDB''', formerly the '''Institut Internationale d'Embryologie''' ('''IIE'''), is a non-profit scientific association promoting [[developmental biology]].  The society holds an international Congress every four years, and awards the most prestigious award in the field of developmental biology—the [[Ross Harrison Prize]].&lt;ref name="aboutisdb"&gt;[http://www.developmental-biology.org/about/about.html "About the ISDB"], International Society of Developmental Biologists.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was founded as by [[A. A. W. Hubrecht]] in 1911 as "a selective society of embryologists who would meet and discuss aspects of comparative embryology".&lt;ref name="noel"&gt;Emily Noël, [http://thenode.biologists.com/the-rebirth-of-the-dsdb/ "The (re)birth of the DSDB"], TheNode.Biologists.com, Feb. 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  After Hubrecht's death in 1915, the first director was [[Daniel de Lange]];&lt;ref name="noel" /&gt; other former presidents have included [[Etienne Wolf]], [[Lauri Saxén]] (1973–77),&lt;ref&gt;Eero Lehtonen, "Inductive Tissue Interactions: An Interview with Chancellor Lauri Saxén"], ''Int.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7605">'''Lasswell's model of communication''' (also known as '''Lasswell's communication model''') describes an act of communication by defining who said it, what was said, in what channel it was said, to whom it was said, and with what effect it was said. It  is regarded by many [[Communication studies|communication]] and [[public relations]] scholars as "one of the earliest and most influential [[communication model]]s."&lt;ref name="shoemaker2"/&gt;{{rp|109}} The model was developed by American [[Political science|political scientist]] and communication theorist [[Harold Lasswell]] in 1948 while he was a [[professor]] at [[Yale Law School]].&lt;ref name="muth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Muth, R.|title=Harold D. Lasswell: An Annotated Bibliography.|year=1990|publisher=New Haven Press|location=New Haven|author2=Finley, M. |author3=Muth, M. |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1948 article "The Structure and Function of Communication in Society", Lasswell wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[A] convenient way to describe an act of communication is to answer the following questions:
*Who
*Says What
*In Which Channel
*To Whom
*With What Effect?&lt;ref name="lasswell"/&gt;{{rp|37}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Concept and usage==

This verbal communication model has been referred to as "a linear and Uni-directional process",&lt;ref name="shoemaker2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shoemaker|first=Pamela|title=How to Build Social Science Theories|year=2004|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks|author2=Tankard Jr., J. |author3=Lasorsa, D.|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; "a one-way process",&lt;ref name="shoemaker2"/&gt; an "action model",&lt;ref name="shoemaker2"/&gt;{{rp|134}} a media theory "classic",&lt;ref name="real"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Real|first=Michael R.|title=Media Theory: Contributions to an Understanding of American Mass Communications|journal=American Quarterly|year=1980|volume=32|issue=3|page=240|doi=10.2307/2712449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lubkin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lubkin|first=D.|title=Remembering the Straw Man: the Travels and Adventures of Hypodermic. The History of Media and Communication Research: Contested Memories|year=2008|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York|editor=Park, D. |editor2=Pooley, J.|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; "widely used segmentation of the communication process",&lt;ref name="real"/&gt; and "a simple, linear, and potentially hypodermic [[conceptualization]] of communication."&lt;ref name="lubkin" /&gt;

The model organizes the "scientific study of the process of communication".&lt;ref name="lasswell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lasswell|first=Harold|title=The Structure and Function of Communication in Society. The Communication of Ideas|year=1948|publisher=Institute for Religious and Social Studies|location=New York|editor=Bryson, L.|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of the model is broken down by each element of communication: {{"'}}who' refers to the communicator who formulates the [[message]]; 'what' is the content of message; 'channel' indicates the medium of transmission; 'whom' describes either an individual recipient or the [[audience]] of [[mass communication]]; 'effect' is the outcome of the message..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinburg|first=Sheila|title=An Introduction to Communication Studies|year=2007|publisher=Juta &amp; Co|location=Cape Town|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of the message travels from the communicator to the audience. Although this model represents a one-way flow of communication, the "effect" also refers to feedback in public relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reddi|first=C.|title=Effective Public Relations and Media Strategy|year=2009|publisher=PHI Learning Private Limited|location=New Delhi|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model can be used in pedagogical settings to teach students major elements of a communication process and as a starting point for developing hypotheses.

Lasswell stated that the "Who" referred to "control analysis", the "Says What" referred to "[[content analysis]]", the "In Which Channel" referred to "media analysis", the "To Whom" referred to "[[audience analysis]]", and the "With What Effect" referred to "effect analysis".&lt;ref name="lasswell" /&gt;

==Developments and criticisms==

"The Structure and Function of Communication in Society" was reprinted in 1949, 1960, 1966, and 1971.&lt;ref name="muth"/&gt; However, the questions and the model did not change.

[[George Gerbner]], the founder of the [[cultivation theory]], expanded Lasswell's model in 1956 to focus "attention on perception and reaction by the perceiver and the consequences of the communication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=A.|title=Essentials of Mass Communication Theory|year=1995|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, Richard Braddock suggested that the model be expanded to consider two additional elements that Braddock argued it ignored: "for what purpose" and "under what circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braddock|first=Richard|title=An Extension of the "Lasswell Formula"|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1958|volume=8|pages=88–93|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1958.tb01138.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Braddock's model is more applicable to cultivation theory.&lt;ref name="shoemaker2"/&gt;{{rp|137}} According to media scholar Michael Real: "subsequent attempts to add an 'entertainment' function and an 'advertising' function fail to capture Lasswell's intent but provide the largest 'use and gratification' cited by, for example, television viewers."&lt;ref name="real"/&gt;{{rp|244,5}}

In 1993, communication scholars [[Denis McQuail]] and [[Sven Windahl]] referred to Lasswell's model as "perhaps the most famous single phrase in communication research."&lt;ref name=McQ&gt;{{cite book|last=McQuail|first=Denis|title=Communication models for the study of mass communications|year=1993|publisher=Longman|location=New York|edition=2nd|author2=Windahl, Sven |pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; McQuail and Windahl also considered the model as a formula that would be transformed into a model once boxes were drawn around each element and arrows connected the elements.&lt;ref name=McQ/&gt; In 1995, Stanley Baran and Dennis Davis recognized it a verbal model of the communication process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baran|first=S.|title=Mass Communication Theory: Foundations, Ferment, and Future|year=1995|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont|author2=Davis, D. |pages=251–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, Greenberg and Salwen acknowledged that Lasswell's model of communication has been widely adopted, but expressed: "Although Lasswell's model draws attention to several key elements in the mass communication process, it does no more than describe general areas of study. It does not link elements together with any specificity, and there is no notion of an active process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenberg|first=B. S.|title=Mass communication theory and research: Concepts and models. In An integrated approach to communication theory and research|year=2008|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Mahwah|pages=61–74 [69]|author2=Salwen, M. B. |editor=Salwen, M. B. |editor2=Stacks, D.

A '''near-death experience''' ('''NDE''') is a [[personal experience]] associated with death or impending [[death]]. When positive, such experiences may encompass a variety of sensations including detachment from the body, feelings of levitation, total serenity, security, warmth, the experience of absolute dissolution, and the presence of a light. When negative, such experiences may include sensations of torment and torture. &lt;ref name=Sleutjes2014rev&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25357254 | doi=10.1097/NMD.0000000000000205 | volume=202 | issue=11 | title=Almost 40 years investigating near-death experiences: an overview of mainstream scientific journals | year=2014 | journal=J.

Different models have been described to explain NDEs.&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt; [[Neuroscience]] research suggests that an NDE is a [[wikt:subjective#Adjective|subjective]] phenomenon resulting from "disturbed bodily multisensory integration" that occurs during life-threatening events.&lt;ref name=blanke2009&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Neurology of Consciousness|last=Blanke|first=Olaf|publisher=London: Academic Publishers, 2009|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-374168-4|location=London|pages=303–324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent [[french language|French]] term ''expérience de mort imminente'' (experience of imminent death) was proposed by the French [[psychologist]] and [[epistemology|epistemologist]] [[Victor Egger]] as a result of discussions in the 1890s among [[philosopher]]s and psychologists concerning [[Climbing|climbers']] stories of the panoramic life review during falls.&lt;ref&gt;Egger, Victor (1896).

This was also the first time the phenomenon was described as clinical syndrome.&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt; In 1968 [[Celia Green]] published an analysis of 400 first-hand accounts of [[out-of-body experiences]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., ''Out-of-the-body Experiences'', London: Hamish Hamilton, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; This represented the first attempt to provide a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of such experiences, viewed simply as anomalous perceptual experiences, or [[hallucinations]]. In 1969, Swiss-American [[psychiatrist]] and pioneer in near-death studies [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross|Elisabeth Kubler-Ross]] published her groundbreaking book ''[[On Death and Dying|On Death and Dying: What the dying have to teach doctors, nurses, clergy, and their own families.]]'' These experiences were also popularized by the work of [[psychiatrist]] [[Raymond Moody]], who in 1975 coined the term "near-death experience" (NDE) as an umbrella term for the different elements (out of body experiences, the "panoramic life review," the Light, the tunnel, or the border). &lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt; The term "near-death experience" had already been used by [[John C. Lilly]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Schlieter, Jens (2018). What is it like to be Dead? Near-death Experiences, Christianity, and the Occult. New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 205-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Common elements===
[[Research]]ers have identified the common elements that define near-death experiences.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop&gt;Mauro, James. "Bright lights, big mystery", ''Psychology Today'', July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Greyson]] argues that the general features of the experience include impressions of being outside one's physical body, visions of deceased relatives and religious figures, and transcendence of egotic and spatiotemporal boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Greyson, Bruce (2003) "Near-Death Experiences in a Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic Population". Psychiatric Services, December, Vol. 54 No. 12. The American Psychiatric Association&lt;/ref&gt; Many common elements have been reported, although the person's interpretation of these events often corresponds with the [[Culture|cultural]], [[philosophy|philosophical]], or [[religion|religious]] beliefs of the person experiencing it. For example, in the US, where 46% of the population believes in [[guardian angel]]s, they will often be identified as angels or deceased loved ones (or will be unidentified), while Hindus will often identify them as messengers of the god of death.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennard, Mary J 1998"&gt;Kennard, Mary J. "A Visit from an Angel." The American Journal of Nursing 98.3 (1998): 48–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Common traits that have been reported by NDErs are as follows:
* A sense/awareness of being dead.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;
* A sense of [[peace]], [[well-being]] and painlessness. Positive [[emotion]]s. A sense of removal from the world.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;
* An [[out-of-body experience]]. A perception of one's body from an outside position, sometimes observing medical professionals performing resuscitation efforts.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 4003364 | volume=139 | issue=6 | title=Near-death experiences in a pediatric population.

* A "tunnel experience" or entering a darkness. A sense of moving up, or through, a passageway or staircase.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985"/&gt;
* A rapid movement toward and/or sudden immersion in a powerful light (or "Being of Light") which communicates with the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iands.org/ndes/nde-stories/iands-nde-accounts/1067-three-beings-of-light.html|title=Three Beings of Light|last=Lovins|first=LaDonna|website=iands.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An intense feeling of [[unconditional love]] and [[acceptance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/06/29/people-who-had-near-death-experiences-consistently-report-one-thing-gods-love/|title=Opinion {{!}} Stories of God's love common among those who almost die, says doctor who studies them|last=Long|first=Dr Jeffrey|date=2016-06-29|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encountering "Beings of Light", "Beings dressed in white", or similar. Also, the possibility of being reunited with deceased loved ones.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985"/&gt;
* Receiving a [[life review]], commonly referred to as "seeing one's life flash before one's eyes".&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;
* Approaching a border or a decision by oneself or others to return to one's body, often accompanied by a reluctance to return.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985"/&gt;
* Suddenly finding oneself back inside one's body.&lt;ref name= "Moody1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moody|first=Raymond|title=Life After Life|year=1975|isbn=978-0-89176-037-5|publisher=Mockingbird Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Connection to the cultural beliefs held by the individual, which seem to dictate some of the phenomena experienced in the NDE and particularly the later interpretation thereof.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Holden|editor1-first=Janice Miner|editor2-last=Greyson|editor2-first=Bruce|editor3-last=James|editor3-first=Debbie|title=The handbook of near-death experiences thirty years of investigation|date=2009|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-35865-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2017}}

===Stages===
[[Kenneth Ring]] (1980) subdivided the NDE on a five-stage [[continuum (theory)|continuum]]. The subdivisions were:&lt;ref&gt;Ring, K. (1980). Life at death: A scientific investigation of the near-death experience. New York: Coward, McCann, &amp; Geoghegan., p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;
# Peace
# Body separation
# Entering darkness
# Seeing the light
# Entering the light

Charlotte Martial, a neuropsychologist from the [[University of Liège|University of Liège and University Hospital of Liège]] who led a team that investigated 154 NDE cases, concluded that there is not a fixed sequence of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/near-death-experiences-what-happens-when-you-die-643032|title=What happens when you die? Scientists attempt to find out how similar near-death experiences really are|date=2017-07-27|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical circumstances===
Kenneth Ring argues that attempted suicides do not lead more often to unpleasant NDEs than unintended near-death situations.&lt;ref&gt;Ring, Kenneth. ''Heading toward Omega. In search of the Meaning of Near-Death Experience'', 1984, p. 45. "Subsequent research on suicide-related NDEs by Stephen Franklin and myself [Ring] and by Bruce Greyson has also confirmed my earlier tentative findings the NDEs following suicide attempts, however induced, conform to the classic prototype."&lt;/ref&gt;

===After-effects===
NDEs are associated with changes in personality and outlook on life.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt; Ring has identified a consistent set of value and belief changes associated with people who have had a near-death experience. Among these changes, he found a greater appreciation for life, higher self-esteem, greater compassion for others, less concern for acquiring material wealth, a heightened sense of purpose and self-understanding, desire to learn, elevated spirituality, greater ecological sensitivity and planetary concern, and a feeling of being more intuitive.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt; However, not all after-effects are beneficial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 7754094 | volume=18 | issue=3 | title=The meaning of survival: the early aftermath of a near-death experience | date=June 1995 | journal=Res Nurs Health | pages=239–47 | last1 = Orne | first1 = RM | doi=10.1002/nur.4770180307}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Greyson describes circumstances where changes in attitudes and behavior can lead to psychosocial and psychospiritual problems.&lt;ref name=Greyson1997&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9171810 | volume=185 | issue=5 | title=The near-death experience as a focus of clinical attention | date=May 1997 | journal=J.

==Research==
===Near-death studies===
{{Main|Near-death studies}}
[[Bruce Greyson]] ([[psychiatrist]]), [[Kenneth Ring]] ([[psychologist]]), and [[Michael Sabom]] ([[cardiologist]]), helped to launch the field of [[near-death studies]] and introduced the study of near-death experiences to the academic setting. From 1975 to 2005, some 2,500 self-reported individuals in the US had been reviewed in retrospective studies of the phenomena&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt; with an additional 600 outside the US in the West,&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt; and 70 in Asia.&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt; Additionally, prospective studies had identified 270 individuals. Prospective studies review groups of individuals (e.g., selected emergency room patients) and then find who had an NDE during the study's time; such studies cost more to perform.&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt; In all, close to 3,500 individual cases between 1975 and 2005 had been reviewed in one or another study. All these studies were carried out by some 55 researchers or teams of researchers.&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt;

[[Melvin L. Morse|Melvin Morse]], head of the Institute for the Scientific Study of Consciousness, and colleagues&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morse M, Castillo P, Venecia D, Milstein J, Tyler DC. (1986) "Childhood near-death experiences". ''American Journal of Diseases of Children'', Nov;140(11):1110–4.&lt;/ref&gt; have investigated near-death experiences in a pediatric population.

=== Clinical research in cardiac arrest patients ===
==== Parnia 2001 study ====
In 2001, [[Sam Parnia]] and colleagues published the results of a year-long study of cardiac arrest survivors that was conducted at Southampton General Hospital. 63 survivors were interviewed. They had been resuscitated after being [[clinical death|clinically dead]] with no pulse, no respiration, and fixed dilated pupils. Parnia and colleagues investigated [[out-of-body experience]] claims by placing figures on suspended boards facing the ceiling, not visible from the floor.  Four had experiences that, according to the study criteria, were NDEs but none of them experienced the [[out-of-body experience]]. Thus, they were not able to identify the figures.&lt;ref name=Parnia2001primary&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parnia|first=S.|last2=Waller|first2=D.

Psychologist [[Chris French]] wrote regarding the study "unfortunately, and somewhat atypically, none of the survivors in this sample experienced an OBE".&lt;ref name=French2005rev/&gt;

==== Van Lommel's study ====
[[File:Pim van Lommel-1.jpg|250x250px|thumb|[[Pim van Lommel]]]]
In 2001 [[Pim van Lommel]], a cardiologist from the Netherlands, and his team conducted a study on NDEs including 344 cardiac arrest patients who had been successfully resuscitated in 10 Dutch hospitals. Patients not reporting NDEs were used as controls for patients who did, and psychological (e.g. fear before cardiac arrest), demographic (e.g. age, sex), medical (e.g. more than one [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR)) and pharmacological data were compared between the 2 groups. The work also included a longitudinal study where the 2 groups (those who had had an NDE and those who had not had one) were compared at 2 and 8 years, for life changes. One patient had a conventional out of body experience. He reported being able to watch and recall events during the time of his cardiac arrest. His claims were confirmed by hospital personnel. "This did not appear consistent with hallucinatory or illusory experiences, as the recollections were compatible with real and verifiable rather than imagined events".&lt;ref name=Parnia2014rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lommel2001primary&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Lommel|first1=P|last2=van Wees| first2=R|last3=Meyers|first3=V|last4=Elfferich|first4=I|title=Near-death experience in survivors of cardiac arrest: a prospective study in the Netherlands| journal=Lancet |date=15 December 2001 |volume=358 |issue=9298 |pages=2039–45|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)07100-8|pmid=11755611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Awareness during Resuscitation (AWARE) study ====
While at University of Southampton, Parnia was the principal investigator of the AWARE Study, which was launched in 2008.&lt;sup&gt;[[Sam Parnia#cite note-TIME magazine 2008-13|[13]]]&lt;/sup&gt; This study which concluded in 2012 included 33 investigators across 15 medical centers in the UK, Austria and the US and tested consciousness, memories and awareness during cardiac arrest. The accuracy of claims of visual and auditory awareness was examined using specific tests.&lt;ref name=Parnia2015primary&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parnia|first=Sam|last2=Spearpoint|first2=Ken|last3=de Vos|first3=Gabriele |last4=Fenwick |first4=Peter |last5=Goldberg |first5=Diana|last6=Yang|first6=Jie|last7=Zhu|first7=Jiawen|last8=Baker|first8=Katie|last9=Killingback|first9=Hayley|date=2014-12-01 |title=AWARE-AWAreness during REsuscitation-a prospective study |journal=Resuscitation|volume=85|issue=12|pages=1799–1805 |doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2014.09.004 |pmid=25301715}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such test consisted in installing shelves, bearing a variety of images and facing the ceiling, hence not visible by hospital staff, in rooms where cardiac-arrest patients were more likely to occur. The results of the study were published in October 2014; both the launch and the study results were widely discussed in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/04/the-science-of-near-death-experiences/386231/ |title=The science of near-death experiences: Empirically investigating brushes with the afterlife|last=Lichfield|first=Gideon|date=April 2015|website=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic|access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201409/seeing-the-light|title=Seeing the light |last=Weintraub |first=Pamela |date=September 2014 |website=Psychology Today|publisher=Psychology Today|access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review article analyzing the results reports that, out of 2060 cardiac arrest events, 101 of 140 cardiac arrest survivors could complete the questionnaires. Of these 101 patients 9% could be classified as near death experiences. 2 more patients (2% of those completing the questionnaires) described "seeing and hearing actual events related to the period of cardiac arrest". These two patients' cardiac arrests did not occur in areas equipped with ceiling shelves hence no images could be used to objectively test for visual awareness claims. One of the two patients was too sick and the accuracy of her recount could not be verified. For the second patient instead, it was possible to verify the accuracy of the experience and to show that awareness occurred paradoxically some minutes after the heart stopped, at a time when "the brain ordinarily stops functioning and cortical activity becomes isoelectric." The experience was not compatible with an illusion, imaginary event or hallucination since visual (other than of ceiling shelves' images) and auditory awareness could be corroborated.&lt;ref name=Parnia2014rev/&gt;

==== AWARE II ====
{{as of|2016|May}}, a posting at the UK Clinical Trials Gateway website described plans for [[Out-of-body experience#AWARE Study II|AWARE II]], a two-year multicenter observational study of 900-1500 patients experiencing cardiac arrest, which said that subject recruitment had started on 1 August 2014 and that the scheduled end date was 31 May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;UK Clinical Trials Gateway. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160509201054/https://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/trials/trial-details/trial-details?trialId=31651 Primary Trial ID Number 17129], entitled "AWARE II (AWAreness during REsuscitation) A Multi-Centre Observational Study of the Relationship between the Quality of Brain Resuscitation and Consciousness, Neurological, Functional and Cognitive Outcomes following Cardiac Arrest" Last updated May 3, 2016. Page archived May 9, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The study was extended, and it is currently expected to end in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;https://psi-encyclopedia.spr.ac.uk/articles/aware-nde-study&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanatory models ==
In a review article, psychologist [[Chris French]]&lt;ref name="French2005rev"/&gt; has grouped approaches to explain NDEs in three broad groups which "are not distinct and independent, but instead show considerable overlap": spiritual theories (also called transcendental), psychological theories, and physiological theories that provide a physical explanation for NDEs.

=== Spiritual or transcendental theories ===
French summarizes this model by saying : "the most popular interpretation is that the NDE is exactly what it appears to be to the person having the experience".&lt;ref name="French2005rev"/&gt; The NDE would then represent evidence of the supposedly immaterial existence of a soul or mind, which would leave the body upon death. An NDE would then provide information about an immaterial world where the soul would journey upon ending its physical existence on earth.&lt;ref name="French2005rev"/&gt;

According to Greyson&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt; some NDE phenomena cannot be easily explained with our current knowledge of human physiology and psychology. For instance, at a time when they were unconscious patients could accurately describe events as well as report being able to view their bodies "from an out-of-body spatial perspective". In two different studies of patients who had survived a cardiac arrest, those who had reported leaving their bodies could describe accurately their resuscitation procedures or unexpected events, whereas others "described incorrect equipment and procedures".&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt; Sam Parnia also refers to two cardiac arrest studies and one deep hypothermic circulatory arrest study where patients reported visual and/or auditory awareness occurring when their brain function had ceased. These reports "were corroborated with actual and real events".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parnia|first=Sam|date=February 2017|title=Understanding the cognitive experience of death and the near-death experience|url=https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/article-abstract/110/2/67/2681812?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=QJM: An International Journal of Medicine|volume=110(2)|pages=67–69|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parnia2014rev" /&gt;

Five prospective studies have been carried out, to test the accuracy of out of body perceptions by placing "unusual targets in locations likely to be seen by persons having NDEs, such as in an upper corner of a room in the emergency department, the coronary care unit, or the intensive care unit of a hospital." Twelve patients reported leaving their bodies, but unfortunately none could describe the hidden visual targets. Although this is a small sample, the failure of purported out-of-body experiencers to describe the hidden targets raises questions about the accuracy of the anecdotal reports described above.&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt;

Psychologist [[James Alcock]] has described the afterlife claims of NDE researchers as [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. Alcock has written the spiritual or transcendental interpretation "is based on belief in search of data rather than observation in search of explanation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazier|first1=Kendrick|title=Paranormal Borderlands of Science|date=1981|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Buffalo, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-87975-148-7|pages=153–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris French has noted that "the survivalist approach does not appear to generate clear and testable hypotheses. Because of the vagueness and imprecision of the survivalist account, it can be made to explain any possible set of findings and is therefore unfalsifiable and unscientific."&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris French|French, Chris]].

=== Psychological explanations ===
French summarises the main psychological explanations which include: the depersonalization, the expectancy and the dissociation models.&lt;ref name="French2005rev"/&gt;

==== Depersonalization model ====
A depersonalization model was proposed in the 1970s by professor of psychiatry Russell Noyes and clinical psychologist Roy Kletti, which suggested that the NDE is a form of [[depersonalization]] experienced under emotional conditions such as life-threatening danger, potentially inescapable danger, and that the NDE can best be understood as an hallucination.&lt;ref name=French2005rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Noyes |first1 = R |year = 1972 |title = The experience of dying |url = |journal = Psychiatry |volume = 35 |issue = 2|pages = 174–184 |doi=10.1080/00332747.1972.11023710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Noyes |first1 = R. |last2 = Kletti |first2 = R. |year = 1976 |title = Depersonalisation in the face of life-threatening danger: an interpretation |url = |journal = Omega |volume = 7 |issue = 2|pages = 103–114 |doi=10.2190/7qet-2vau-ycdt-tj9r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Noyes |first1 = R. |last2 = Kletti |first2 = R. |year = 1977 |title = Depersonalisation in the face of life-threatening danger |url = |journal = Compr. Psychiat |volume = 18 |issue = |pages = 375–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noyes, R. and Slymen, D. (1978–1979) ''The subjective response to life-threatening danger''. ''Omega'' 9: 313–321.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, those who face their impending death become detached from the surroundings and their own bodies, no longer feel emotions, and experience time distortions.&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt;

This model suffers from a number of limitations to explain NDEs for subjects who do not experience a sensation of being out of their bodies; unlike NDEs, experiences are dreamlike, unpleasant and characterized by "anxiety, panic and emptiness".&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt; Also, during NDEs subjects remain very lucid of their identities, their sense of identify is not changed unlike those experiencing depersonalization.&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt;

==== Expectancy model ====
Another psychological theory is called the expectancy model. It has been suggested that although these experiences could appear very real, they had actually been constructed in the mind, either consciously or subconsciously, in response to the stress of an encounter with death (or perceived encounter with death), and did not correspond to a real event. In a way, they are similar to wish-fulfillment: because someone thought they were about to die, they experienced certain things in accordance with what they expected or wanted to occur. Imagining a heavenly place was in effect a way for them to soothe themselves through the stress of knowing that they were close to death.&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt; Subjects use their own personal and cultural expectations to imagine a scenario that would protect them against an imminent threat to their lives.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

Subjects' accounts often differed from their own "religious and personal expectations regarding death" which contradicts the hypothesis they may have imagined a scenario based on their cultural and personal background.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

Although the term NDE was first coined in 1975 and the experience first described then, recent descriptions of NDEs do not differ from those reported earlier than 1975. The only exception is the more frequent description of a tunnel.  Hence, the fact that information about these experiences could be more easily obtained after 1975, did not influence people's reports of the experiences.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

Another flaw of this model can be found in children's accounts of NDEs. These are similar to adults', and this despite children being less affected by religious or cultural influences about death.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

==== Dissociation model ====
The dissociation model proposes that NDE is a form of withdrawal to protect an individual from a stressful event. Under extreme circumstances some people may detach from certain unwanted feelings in order to avoid experiencing their emotional impact and suffering associated with them. The person also detaches from one's immediate surroundings.&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt;

==== Birth model ====
The birth model suggests that near death experiences could be a form of reliving the trauma of birth. Since a baby travels from the darkness of the womb to light and is greeted by the love and warmth of the nursing and medical staff, and so, it was proposed, the dying brain could be recreating the passage through a tunnel to light, warmth and affection.&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt;

Reports of leaving the body through a tunnel are equally frequent among subjects who were born by cesarean section and natural birth. Also, newborns do not possess "the visual acuity, spatial stability of their visual images, mental alertness, and cortical coding capacity to register memories of the birth experience".&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

=== Physiological explanations (organic theories) ===
A wide range of physiological theories of the NDE have been put forward including those based upon [[cerebral hypoxia]], anoxia, and [[hypercapnia]]; endorphins and other neurotransmitters; and abnormal activity in the [[temporal lobe]]s.&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt;

Neurobiological factors in the experience have been investigated by researchers in the field of medical science and psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;Mayank and Mukesh, 2004; Jansen, 1995; Thomas, 2004; Fenwick and Fenwick 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Among the researchers and commentators who tend to emphasize a naturalistic and neurological base for the experience are the [[Great Britain|British]] [[psychologist]] [[Susan Blackmore]] (1993), with her "dying brain hypothesis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bassham |first1=Gregory|title=Critical Thinking: A Student's Untroduction|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-07-287959-9 |page=485 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====  Neuroanatomical models ====
Neuroscientists Olaf Blanke and Sebastian Dieguez (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Leaving Body And Life Behind:[http://lnco.epfl.ch/files/content/sites/lnco/files/shared/publications/lnco/2009_Dieguez_NC(chap)_leaving%20body%20and%20life%20behind-out%20of%20body%20and%20near%20death%20experience.pdf lnco.epfl.ch]&lt;/ref&gt; from the ''[[Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]]'', [[Switzerland]], propose a brain based model with two types of NDEs : 
* "type 1 NDEs are due to bilateral frontal and occipital, but predominantly right hemispheric brain damage affecting the right temporal parietal junction and characterized by out of body experiences, altered sense of time, sensations of flying, lightness vection and flying" &lt;ref name="blanke2009" /&gt;
* "type 2 NDEs are also due to bilateral frontal and occipital, but predominantly left hemispheric brain damage affecting the left temporal parietal junction and characterized by feeling of a presence, meeting and communication with spirits, seeing of glowing bodies, as well as voices, sounds, and music without vection" &lt;ref name="blanke2009" /&gt;
They suggest that damage to the bilateral [[Occipital lobe|occipital cortex]] may lead to visual features of NDEs such as seeing a tunnel or lights, and "damage to unilateral or bilateral temporal lobe structures such as the [[hippocampus]] and amygdala" may lead to emotional experiences, memory flashbacks or a life review. They concluded that future neuroscientific studies are likely to reveal the neuroanatomical basis of the NDE which will lead to the demystification of the subject without needing paranormal explanations.&lt;ref name="blanke2009" /&gt;

[[File:Temporal lobe animation.gif|thumb|160px|left|Animation of the human left temporal lobe]]

French has written that the "temporal lobe is almost certain to be involved in NDEs, given that both damage to and direct cortical stimulation of this area are known to produce a number of experiences corresponding to those of the NDE, including OBEs, hallucinations, and memory flashbacks".&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt;

Vanhaudenhuyse ''et al''. 2009 reported that recent studies employing [[deep brain stimulation]] and [[neuroimaging]] have demonstrated that out-of-body experiences result from a deficient [[multisensory integration]] at the [[temporoparietal junction]] and that ongoing studies aim to further identify the functional neuroanatomy of near-death experiences by means of standardized EEG recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intensive Care Medicine |date=2009|publisher=Springer New York | isbn=978-0-387-92277-5 |location=[S.l.] |pages=961–968 |last1=Vincent |first1=Jean-Louis|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-92276-6_85|chapter=Towards a Neuro-scientific Explanation of Near-death Experiences?|citeseerx=10.1.1.368.4580}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to Greyson&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt; multiple neuroanatomical models have been proposed where NDEs have been hypothesized to originate from different anatomical areas of the brain, namely: the limbic system, the hippocampus, the left temporal lobe, Reissen's fiber in the central canal of the spinal cord, the prefrontal cortex, the right temporal lobe.

Blanke et al.&lt;ref name="blanke2009" /&gt; admit that their model remains speculative to the lack of data. Likewise Greyson&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt; writes that although some or any of the neuroanatomical models proposed may serve to explain NDEs and pathways through which they are expressed, they remain speculative at this stage since they have not been tested in empirical studies.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

==== Neurochemical models ====
Some theories hypothesize that drugs used during resuscitation induced NDEs, for example, [[ketamine]] or as resulting from endogeneous chemicals that transmit signals between brain cells, [[neurotransmitter]]s:&lt;ref name=French2005rev/&gt;
* In the early eighties, Daniel Carr wrote that NDE has characteristics are suggestive of a [[limbic lobe]] syndrome and that the NDE can be explained by the release of [[endorphins]] and [[enkephalin]]s in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carr | first1 = Daniel | year = 1981 | title = Endorphins at the Approach of Death | url = |journal = Lancet | volume = 317 | issue = 8216| page = 390 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(81)91714-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carr |first1 = Daniel | year = 1982 | title = Pathophysiology of Stress-Induced Limbic Lobe Dysfunction: A Hypothesis Relevant to Near-Death Experiences | url = | journal = Anabiosis: The Journal of Near-Death Studies | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 75–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endorphins are endogenous molecules "released in times of stress and lead to a reduction in pain perception and a pleasant, even blissful, emotional state." &lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt; 
* Judson and Wiltshaw (1983) noted how the administration of endorphin-blocking agents such as [[naloxone]] had been occasionally reported to produce "hellish" NDEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Wiltshaw|first2=E.|year=1983|title=A near-death experience|url=|journal=Lancet|issue=8349|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(83)90582-2 |pages=561–562|last1=Judson|first1=I. R|volume=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be coherent with endorphins' role in causing a "positive emotional tone of most NDEs".&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt; 
* Morse ''et al''. 1989 proposed a model arguing that [[serotonin]] played a more important role than endorphins in generating NDEs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morse | first1 = M. L | last2 = Venecia | first2 = D | last3 = Milstein | first3 = J. | year = 1989 | title = Near-death experiences: A neurophysiological explanatory model | url = | journal = Journal of Near-Death Studies | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 45–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "at least with respect to mystical hallucinations and OBEs".&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt;

According to Parnia, neurochemical models are not backed by data. This is true for "NMDA receptor activation, serotonin, and endorphin release" models.&lt;ref name="Parnia2014rev" /&gt; Parnia writes that no data has been collected via thorough and careful experimentation to back "a possible causal relationship or even an association" between neurochemical agents and NDE experiences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Multi-factorial models ====
The first formal neurobiological model for NDE, included endorphins, neurotransmitters of the [[limbic system]], the temporal lobe and other parts of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Gómez-Jeria|first2=Juan S.|year=1989|title=A Neurobiological Model for Near-Death Experiences|url=http://200.89.70.78:8080/jspui/handle/2250/14775|journal=Journal of Near-Death Studies|volume=7|issue=4|pages=205–222|doi=10.1007/bf01074007|last1=Saavedra-Aguilar|first1=J.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensions and variations of their model came from other scientists such as Louis Appleby (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1989|title=Near·death experience: Analogous to other stress induced psychological phenomena|url=|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=298|issue=|pages=976–977|last1=Appleby|first1=L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors suggest that all components of near-death experiences can be explained in their entirety via psychological or neurophysiological mechanisms, although the authors admit that these hypotheses have to be tested by science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mobbs|first=Dean|last2=Watt|first2=Caroline|date=October 2011|title=There is nothing paranormal about near-death experiences: how neuroscience can explain seeing bright lights, meeting the dead, or being convinced you are one of them|url=|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=15|issue=10|pages=447–449|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2011.07.010|pmid=21852181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====  Low oxygen levels (and G-LOC) model  ====
Low oxygen levels in the blood (hypoxia or anoxia) have been hypothesized to induce hallucinations and hence possibly explain NDEs.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name=French2005rev/&gt; This is because low oxygen levels characterize life-threatening situations and also by the apparent similarities between NDEs and G-force induced loss of consciousness ([[G-LOC]]) episodes.

These episodes are observed with fighter pilots experiencing very rapid and intense acceleration that result in lack of sufficient blood supply to the brain. Whinnery&lt;ref name="Whinnery"&gt;Whinnery, J. E. (1997). ''Psychophysiologic correlates of unconsciousness and near-death experiences''. J. Near Death Stud 15: 231–258.&lt;/ref&gt; studied almost 1000 cases and noted how the experiences often involved "tunnel vision and bright lights, floating sensations, automatic movement, autoscopy, OBEs, not wanting to be disturbed, paralysis, vivid dreamlets of beautiful places, pleasurable sensations, psychological alterations of euphoria and dissociation, inclusion of friends and family, inclusion of prior memories and thoughts, the experience being very memorable (when it can be remembered), confabulation, and a strong urge to understand the experience."&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whinnery" /&gt;

However, hypoxia-induced acceleration's primary characteristics are "rythmic jerking of the limbs, compromised memory of events just prior to the onset of unconsciousness, tingling of extremities ..." that are not observed during NDEs.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt; Also G-LOC episodes do not feature life reviews, mystical experiences and "long-lasting transformational aftereffects", although this may be due to the fact that subjects have no expectation of dying.&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt;

Also, hypoxic hallucinations are characterized by "distress and agitation" and this is very different from near death experiences which subjects report as being pleasant.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

==== Altered blood gas levels models ====
Some investigators have studied whether [[wikt:hypercarbia|hypercarbia]] or higher than normal carbon dioxide levels, could explain the occurrence of NDEs. However, studies are difficult to interpret since NDEs have been observed both with increased levels as well as decreased levels of carbon dioxide, and finally some other studies have observed NDEs when levels had not changed, and there is little data.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

==== Other models ====
French said that at least some reports of NDEs might be based upon [[False memory syndrome|false memories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = French | first1 = Chris | authorlink = Chris French | year = 2001 | title = Dying to Know the Truth: Visions of a Dying Brain, or False Memories? | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 358 | issue = 9298| pages = 2010–2011 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(01)07133-1| pmid = 11755600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Engmann (2008) near-death experiences of people who are [[clinical death|clinically dead]] are psychopathological symptoms caused by a severe malfunction of the brain resulting from the cessation of cerebral blood circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Engmann, Birk. (2008). ''Near-death Experiences: A review on the thesis of pathoclisis, neurotransmitter abnormalities, and psychological aspects''. MMW-Fortschr.Med.Nr.51-52/2008(150.Jg.) pp.42–43. {{PMID|19156957}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important question is whether it is possible to "translate" the bloomy experiences of the reanimated survivors into psychopathologically basic phenomena, e.g., acoasms (nonverbal auditory hallucinations), central narrowing of the visual field, [[autoscopy|autoscopia]], [[visual hallucinations]], activation of limbic and memory structures according to Moody's stages. The symptoms suppose a primary affliction of the [[occipital lobe|occipital]] and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] cortices under clinical death. This basis could be congruent with the thesis of [[pathoclisis]]—the inclination of special parts of the brain to be the first to be damaged in case of disease, lack of oxygen, or malnutrition—established eighty years ago by [[Cécile Vogt-Mugnier|Cécile]] and [[Oskar Vogt]].&lt;ref&gt;Vogt C, Vogt O. (1922). ''Erkrankungen der Großhirnrinde im Lichte der Topistik, Pathoklise und Pathoarchitektonik''. Journal für Psychologie und Neurologie; Bd. 28. Joh.- Ambr.- Barth- Verlag. Leipzig. (German).&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of neurology [[Terence Hines]] (2003) claimed that near-death experiences are hallucinations caused by [[Cerebral hypoxia|cerebral anoxia]], drugs, or brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hines|first1=Terence|title=Pseudoscience and the Paranormal|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, N.Y.|isbn=978-1-57392-979-0|pages=101–104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-cultural aspects==
Gregory Shushan published an analysis of the afterlife beliefs of five ancient civilisations (Old and Middle Kingdom Egypt, Sumerian and Old Babylonian Mesopotamia, Vedic India, pre-Buddhist China, and pre-Columbian Mesoamerica) and compared them with historical and contemporary reports of near-death experiences, and [[shamanism|shaman]]ic afterlife "journeys". Shushan found similarities across time, place, and culture that he found could not be explained by coincidence; he also found elements that were specific to cultures; Shushan concludes that some form of mutual influence between experiences of an afterlife and culture probably influence one another and that this inheritance in turn influences individual NDEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shushan|first1=Gregory|title=Conceptions of the Afterlife in Early Civilizations: Universalism, Constructivism, and Near-Death Experience|date=2009|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-0-8264-4073-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, it has been argued that near-death experiences and many of their elements (vision of God, judgment, the tunnel, or the life review) are closely related to religious and spiritual traditions of the West. It was mainly Christian visionaries, Spiritualists, Occultists, and Theosophists of the 19th and 20th century that reported them (Schlieter 2018).

According to Parnia, near death experiences' interpretations are influenced by religious, social, cultural backgrounds. However, the core elements appear to transcend borders and can be considered universal. In fact, some of these core elements have even been reported by children &lt;3 years old (this occurred over many months, whilst playing and communicated using children's language). In other words, at an age where they should not have been influenced by culture or tradition.&lt;ref name="Parnia2014rev" /&gt;

Also, according to Greyson,&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt; the central features of NDEs are universal and have not been influenced by time. These have been observed throughout history and in different cultures. This notwithstanding, cultural influences have probably played a role in some NDEs' reported descriptions.

'''Neuropsychoanalysis''' (previously '''neuro-psychoanalysis''') is a movement within [[neuroscience]] and [[psychoanalysis]] to combine the insights of both disciplines for a better understanding of mind and brain.

==Theoretical base: dual aspect monism==

Neuropsychoanalysis fits under the more general heading of [[neuropsychology]]: relating biological brain to psychological functions and behavior. Neuropsychoanalysis further seeks to remedy classical neurology's exclusion of the subjective mind.

{{Quotation|Neuropsychology, like classical neurology, aims to be entirely objective, and its great power, its advances, come from just this.  But a living creature, and especially a human being is first and last ''active''—a subject, not an object.  It is precisely the subject, the living "I," which is being excluded....What we need now, and need for the future, is a neurology of self, of identity.|[[Oliver Sacks]]|A Leg to Stand On&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sacks | first1 = Oliver | authorlink1 = Oliver_Sacks | title = A Leg to Stand On | chapter = Understanding | publisher = Simon and Schuster | year = 1998 | pages = 177 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kPi_vKQf-WMC&amp;pg=PA177 | accessdate = 2011-06-19 | isbn = 0-684-85395-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Subjective mind, that is, sensations and thoughts and feelings and consciousness, seems a completely different thing from the cellular matter that gives rise to mind, so much so that [[Descartes]] concluded they were two entirely different kinds of stuff, mind and brain.  Accordingly, he invented the "[[Mind-body dualism|dualism]]" of the mind, the [[mind-body dichotomy]].  Body is one kind of thing, and mind (or spirit or soul) is another.  But since this second kind of stuff does not lend itself to scientific inquiry, most of today's psychologists and neuroscientists have rejected Cartesian dualism.

They have had difficulty finding an alternative, however.  The opposite position, monism, says there is only one kind of stuff, brain, and the sensations like the red of a tomato simply represent the pattern of activation of certain brain cells.  Many people find this simple monism unsatisfactory, though, because it does not really deal with the fact that the red of a tomato and a pattern of activation in region V4 of the visual system seem so very different.  Bridging that difference is what neuroscience calls "the hard problem."

Neuropsychoanalysis meets this challenge via dual-aspect [[monism]], sometimes referred to as [[perspectivism]].  That is, we are monistic.  Our brains, including mind, are made of one kind of stuff, cells, but we perceive this stuff in two different ways.&lt;ref name="SolmsTurnbull2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Solms|author2=Oliver Turnbull|title=The brain and the inner world: an introduction to the neuroscience of subjective experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8MXbCAsDuVwC|accessdate=2011-06-19|year=2002|publisher=Other Press, LLC|isbn=978-1-59051-017-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|56–58}}

One is the neuroscientists' "objective" way.  They dissect the brain with scalpel and microscope or look at it with brain scans and then trace neurochemical pathways.  Neurology observes "mind" from outside, that is, by means of the neurological examination: questionnaires, the Boston Naming test or Wisconsin Sorting, bisecting lines, acting out how you use a screwdriver, and so on.  Neurologists can compare the changes in psychological function that the neurological examination shows with the associated changes in the brain, either post mortem or by means of modern imaging technology.

The other way is the layman's or Descartes' or the psychoanalysts' way.  We can observe "subjectively," from inside a mind, how we feel and what we think.  [[Freud]] refined this kind of observation into free association.  He claimed and a century of therapy confirms that this is the best technique that we have for perceiving complex mental functions that simple introspection will not reveal.  Through psychoanalysis, we can discover mind's unconscious functioning.

Perhaps because Freud himself began his career as a neurologist, many of today's  neurologists take psychoanalysis somewhat more seriously than, say, experimental psychologists do. As a result, the neuropsychoanalytic group has been able to draw useful insights from a number of distinguished neuroscientists: [[Antonio Damasio]], [[Eric Kandel]], [[Joseph LeDoux]], [[Helen Mayberg]], [[Jaak Panksepp]], [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran|VS Ramachandran]], [[Oliver Sacks]], [[Mark Solms]] and many others. (Some serve on the editorial board of the journal ''Neuropsychoanalysis'').

==Research directions==

Neuropsychoanalytic researchers put these two kinds of knowledge together.  They relate unconscious (and sometimes conscious) functioning  discovered through the techniques of psychoanalysis or [[experimental psychology]] to underlying brain processes.  Among the ideas explored in recent research are the following:

* "Consciousness" is limited (5-9 bits of information) compared to emotional and unconscious thinking based in the [[limbic system]].&lt;ref name="SolmsTurnbull2002"/&gt; Note: Solm's book showed as reference in the footnote does not provide such an information. It may be confused with the capacity of short-term memory.
* Secondary-process, reality-oriented thinking can be understood as [[frontal lobe]] [[Executive functions|executive control]] systems.&lt;ref name="SolmsTurnbull2002"/&gt;
* [[Dream]]s, [[confabulation]]s, and other expressions of primary-process thinking are meaningful, wish-fulfilling manifestations of the loss of [[frontal lobe|frontal]] [[Executive functions|executive control]] of [[Mesocortical pathway|mesocortical]] and [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] "seeking" systems.&lt;ref name="SolmsTurnbull2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan-SolmsSolms2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karen Kaplan-Solms|author2=Mark Solms|title=Clinical Studies in Neuro-Psychoanalysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrJlGOZvjqEC|accessdate=2011-06-19|date=2001-11-17|publisher=Other Press, LLC|isbn=978-1-59051-026-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Freud]]'s "[[libido]]" corresponds to a [[dopamine]]rgic [[Reward system|seeking system]]&lt;ref name="Panksepp2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jaak Panksepp|title=Affective neuroscience: the foundations of human and animal emotions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqcRGagyEuAC|accessdate=19 June 2011|date=15 September 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-517805-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|144}}
* [[motivation|Drives]] can be understood as a series of basic emotions (prompts to action) anchored in [[pons|pontine]] regions, specifically the [[periaqueductal gray]], and projecting to [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]]: ''play''; ''seeking''; ''caring''; ''fear''; ''anger''; ''sadness''.  ''Seeking'' is constantly active; the others seek appropriate consummations (corresponding to Freud's "dynamic" unconscious).&lt;ref name="Panksepp2004"/&gt;
* Seemingly rational and conscious decisions are driven from the [[limbic system]] by emotions which are unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Neural Bases of Motivated Reasoning: An fMRI Study of Emotional Constraints on Partisan Political Judgment in the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | date = 2006 |

[[File:ELISA.jpg|thumb|ELISA: a common immunoassay]]
'''Palaeoimmunology''' or '''paleo-immunology''' ("''paleo''"=ancient, "''immuno''"=referring to [[immunology]]) is the analysis using [[Immunohistochemistry|histochemical]] techniques to look at the [[matrix protein]]s in historic and [[pre-historic]] materials.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Modern [[Immunoassay|immunological assays]] are used to detect the presence of specific [[antigen]]s in the sample material. Specimens subject to immunoassays have usually been preserved in a way that has prevented biomolecular targets from degrading. This has either been achieved through natural preservative circumstances, such as accelerated [[fossil]]ization,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schweitzer|first=M.

== Examples of use ==
Paleo-immunology encompasses a variety of immunoassays performed on a diverse array of archaeological materials. Paleo-immunology is a new, growing field that is still being properly defined. Examples of paleo-immunology as they appear in peer reviewed literature are as follows:
* The extraction and analysis of [[Collagen|collagen peptides]] from fossilized bones.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
* The use of [[immunofluorescence]] and [[Immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemical]] techniques in order to study the proteins of the [[extracellular matrix]] found in mummified tissues. This was done to further understand the physiologic and pathologic alterations that can occur in preserved prehistoric tissues.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; 
* A plague dipstick assay was used to detect the presence of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] antigens in medieval French graves. This paleo-immunological assay is also known as a "rapid diagnostic test for the plague" (RDT).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kacki|first=Sacha|last2=Rahalison|first2=Lila|last3=Rajerison|first3=Minoarisoa|last4=Ferroglio|first4=Ezio|last5=Bianucci|first5=Raffaella|year=2011|title=Black Death in the rural cemetery of Saint-Laurent-de-la-Cabrerisse Aude-Languedoc, southern France, 14th century: immunological evidence|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440310003675|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=38|issue=3|pages=581–587|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2010.10.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14062">'''The Papaye Peasant Movement''', Mouvman Peyizan Papay (MPP) in [[Haitian Creole]], is recognized as both the largest peasant movement in Haiti and a grass-roots organization (GRO). MPP has approximately 60,000 members, including 20,000 women and 10,000 youths.&lt;ref name="Chavannes Jean-Baptiste"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chavannes Jean-Baptiste|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/2005/islands|website=The Goldman Environmental Prize|publisher=The Goldman Environmental Prize|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is localized in the Central Plateau, home to about 13% of the Haitian population, the majority of whom are rural [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]] or agricultural workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geographical Context|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/-Geographical-context,53-.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MPP focuses on re-establishing [[food sovereignty]] in [[Haiti]] through a number or programs and methods which include educating people on [[Sustainable agriculture|sustainable farming]] methods and organizing skills. While these are the primary foci of MPP, the organization has expanded to provide a plethora of other services to its members, including legal aid, health care services, and university scholarships. The movement seeks to empower peasants to control their own livelihood, thus decreasing dependency on multinational organizations which have flooded the Haitian agricultural market in recent decades.

== Organization ==

Workers in the same neighborhood join together to form groups which meet weekly. At least seven groups in the same region form a local assembly, which meets monthly. The regional assembly, comprising at least four local assemblies, meets every three months, while the general assembly – which all local assemblies attend – meets once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organisation|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/-Organisation,66-.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Papaye Peasant Movement was established in 1973 by [[Jean-Baptiste Chavannes (agronomist)|Jean-Baptiste Chavannes]], a Catholic lay-worker turned [[Agronomy|agronomist]], with the intent to collaborate with rural farmworkers in order to develop more efficient and more sustainable farming methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chavannes Jean-Baptiste ensures a future for Haitian farmers|url=http://grist.org/article/nijhuis-jean-baptiste/|website=Grist|publisher=Grist|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Chavannes originally worked with two small groups (groupements) of workers, MPP now includes over 4,000 groups. The organizations' activities have diversified over time, in a slow but methodical manner, beginning with economic initiatives.

In 1976, MPP implemented a savings and [[credit union]], SERE POU CHOFE (Haitian Creole for "Save to Warm") in part because the heads of the movement saw increasing personal income and tackling hunger is being inherently linked to one another. SERE POU CHOFE enabled members to where members deposit savings from which other members could borrow and then replenish.

In 1978, MPP created KONBIT SÈVO MEN AK KÈ ANSANM (Union of minds, hearts, and hands), also known as KOSMIKA, a multi-sector union which focused on storing and producing agricultural products, finding and building warehouses to store farming tools, and establishing a farmer's bank. The following year, MPP founded a youth leadership program and the Young Peasant Workers association or Jeunes Travailleurs Paysan (JTP) which works to educate youths on a variety of subjects and prepares them to take on leadership roles later in life.

The Movement of Women of MPP, along with a separate association for and run by women, was established in 1981 in order to attack [[gender inequality]] within the movement. These two entities focus on tackling violence against women, defending social and cultural rights, as well as promoting economic independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of MPP|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/-History-.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its early years, the MPP had to maintain a relatively low profile due to political and economic oppression imposed by the [[Jean-Claude Duvalier|Duvalier]] regime in Haiti. When Duvalier was forced out in 1986, the movement began to gain political traction, and played a large role in supporting Operation Lavalas, [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide|Jean-Bertrand Aristide's]] party. Aristide became the first democratically elected president of Haiti in 1991, only to be [[1991 Haitian coup d'état|overthrown]] a few months later. Many of the leaders of MPP went into hiding, while others were imprisoned or tortured. Chavannes Jean-Baptiste himself went into exile from 1993 to 1994. Nevertheless, the movement continued its activities and opened an office in Boston in order to spread information on a worldwide scale. Full operations resumed in 1994 when Haiti established a constitutional government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Uvin|first1=Peter|title=Fighting Hunger at the Grassroots: Paths to Scaling Up|journal=World Development|date=January 1995|volume=23|issue=6|pages=927–938|doi=10.1016/0305-750x(95)00028-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intervention areas ==

=== Community education and legal aid ===

MPP provides a number of training education programs and workshops for group members, while also providing university-level training for middle managers who often come back to the organization. Higher-level workshops are also provided to trained instructors.

The youth education program, JTP, is organized by a three-tier system: Pre-Nursery JTP (PPJTP) for children ages 5 to 10, Nursery JTP (PJTP) for children ages 10 to 15, and JTP for people ages 15 through 30, though members of JTP can also become group members or leaders within MPP. JTP programs provide courses on sex education, sports, music, dance, theater, and cultural activities. Some participants receive university scholarships and are sent to study in Port-au-Prince or abroad.

MPP also has a legal aid department which informs members of their rights, basic legal training, as well as legal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Education|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/Community-Education.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic services ===

MPP develops [[cooperative]]s within different assemblies and trains assembly members to manage the financial aspects of their projects. The organization also conducts feasibility and productivity studies, helps grous prepare reports, and provides economic counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economy and Cooperatives|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/Economy-and-Cooperatives.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February, 2013, MPP celebrated the inauguration of a modern corn storage and processing mill which was built with the help of two Canadian organizations: [[Development and Peace (Canada)|Développement et Paix]] and [[ACDI/VOCA|ACDI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inauguration of a storage center at Marmmont|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/Inauguration-of-a-storage-centre.html|website=Mouvment Paysan Papaye}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community healthcare ===

MPP has a number of health projects relating to hygiene, [[Reproductive health|sexual health]], nutrition, and parenting skills. It also has a health center with a laboratory, and a pharmacy where community members can receive services and medical consultations. MPP also has a community health worker program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Healthcare|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/Community-Healthcare.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

=== Agro-ecology ===

About 75% of the Haitian population lives in rural areas, a large portion of whom practice subsistence agriculture. Until the 1980s, the country was in large part self-sustainable in terms of rice, manioc, and potato production. After the dismantlement of the Duvalier dictatorship, however, organizations such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] urged the country to liberalize markets and undergo structural reform, leading to a rural exodus and greatly affecting the agricultural sector. The liberalization of markets caused government funding for agricultural and public-sector  development to decrease, further depleting the agricultural sector. Many [[multinational corporation]]s took advantage of the newly liberalized market to export goods, creating Haitian dependency on agricultural imports. Additionally, [[Deforestation in Haiti|deforestation]] has caused mass erosion, thus decreasing soil arability and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Papaye Peasant Movement (MPP)|url=http://map.seedmap.org/solutions/food-sovereignty/people-farmer-led-movements/papaye-peasant-movement-mpp/|website=Seed Map|publisher=Seed Map|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MPP's [[Agroecology|agro-ecology]] program seeks to address the issue of dependence and food sovereignty by focusing on forms of agriculture based on environmental health. The organization teaches innovative farming practices, including germinating seedlings inside discarded tires and using other methods so as not to exhaust the land. Farmers focus on growing organic, indigenous crops in order to maintain biodiversity, and thus reject hybrid and GMO seed donations from multinational corporations. The program also comprises a reforestation component in order to help improve soil quality and prevent further erosion. Since its inception, MPP members have planted over 20&amp;nbsp;million trees, and their efforts continue.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Beverly|title=Haitian Farmers Resist GM Crops, Environmental Destruction|url=http://truth-out.org/archive/component/k2/item/89771:haitian-farmers-resist-gm-crops-environmental-destruction|accessdate=21 November 2014|agency=Truthout|publisher=Truthout|date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water management ===

MPP conducts courses on [[Water resource management|water management]] and storage. Methods include draining water from kitchens and showers into ponds filled, gravel, and charcoal, thus producing clean water. This water is then used to for irrigation and fish breeding. MPP also uses cisterns to catch water on rooves, mountain-top catchment lakes, and water-drip irrigation systems in order to save and store water.&lt;ref name=Bell /&gt;

=== Alternative energy ===

MPP has taken on multiple [[alternative energy]] initiatives. Leaders have conducted workshops on how to install [[solar panel]]s and how to build solar-powered batteries; they have also established a facility to manufacture solar products.&lt;ref name="Chavannes Jean-Baptiste"/&gt; Additionally, MPP promotes the use of natural fertilizer such as manure and compost.&lt;ref name=Bell /&gt; They also produce alternative charcoal, bio-fuel from waste, and other alternative energy methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative Energy|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/-Alternative-Energy,69-.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eco-villages ===

After the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]], there was an urban exodus to rural areas like Papaye, particularly from the Haitian capital of [[Port-au-Prince]]. MMP set up a camp for internally displaced people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leitch|first1=Laurie|title=Hope in the Ruins|journal=Psychotherapy Network|date=August 2010|pages=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in collaborations with partners such as [[Unitarian Universalist Service Committee]] (UUSC), helped refugees build eco-villages. Earthquake survivors, MMP members, and volunteers built the houses, – survivors were paid a minimum salary for their work – taught urban dwellers sustainable farming methods, and set up personal and community gardens. Water management methods were also installed so that eco-village dwellers would have access to clean water. So far, the experiment has been a success and many other organizations are replicating this model in Haiti and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haiti Eco-village|url=http://vimeo.com/62163892|website=Vimeo|publisher=UUSC|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns and Public Events ==

=== World Environment Day Protest ===
In June, 2012, 12,000 Haitian farmers marched in the streets of the town of [[Hinche]] in order to protest multinational corporations pushing [[hybrid seed]]s and biofuels on local farmers.  They buried coffins inscribed with the names of a number of corporations as a part of the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farmers say no to multinational offensive|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/Farmers-say-no-to-multinational.html|website=Mouvement Paysan Papaye}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seeds for Haïti ===
The Seeds for Haïti campaign was launched inn 2012 in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Sandy]] in collaboration with MPP's French partner, [[Frères des Hommes]].  The organizations were able to raise enough money to buy 20 tons of seeds in order to support Haitian farmers who lost their supply as a result of the hurricane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7688">The '''patriarchal age''' is the era of the three [[Patriarchs (Bible)|biblical patriarchs]], [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]], according to the narratives of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12–50. (These chapters also contain the history of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]], although Joseph is not one of the patriarchs.) It is preceded in the Bible by the [[primeval history]] and followed by [[The Exodus]].

==Jewish tradition==
The Bible contains an intricate pattern of chronologies from the creation of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], the first man, to the reigns of the later kings of ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. Based on this chronology and the Rabbinic tradition, ancient Jewish sources such as [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] date the birth of [[Abraham]] to 1948 [[Anno Mundi|AM]] (c. 1813 BCE)&lt;ref name="abraham_jvl"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/abraham.html Jewish Virtual Library: Abraham]&lt;/ref&gt; and place the death of [[Jacob]] in 2255 AM (c. 1506 BCE).

==Biblical criticism==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
History known and dateable independently from the Bible first makes contact with the Scriptures during the era of the first Jewish kings. As such, the events before this period came to be disputed with the advent of [[biblical criticism]] in the 19th century. Little interest in questioning the [[Chronology of the Bible|biblical chronology]] existed before then, but with the development of the [[documentary hypothesis]] – the theory that the [[Pentateuch]], including the [[Book of Genesis]], was composed not by [[Moses]] but by unknown authors living at various times between 950 and 450 BC.

==Early biblical archaeology==
Out of this heated debate between the various theories of [[biblical criticism]] and traditional, religious interpretations was born [[biblical archaeology]], a form of archaeology different from others in that it sought not to discover and interpret mute evidence, but to validate or invalidate the historicity of the patriarchs and the events surrounding their lives, as described within the Bible.

The most eminent of early biblical archaeologists was [[William F. Albright]], who believed that he had identified the patriarchal age in the period 2100–1800 BC, the Intermediate [[Bronze Age]], the interval between two periods of highly developed urban culture in ancient [[Canaan]]. Albright argued that he had found evidence of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|sudden collapse]] of the previous Early Bronze Age culture, and ascribed this to the invasion of migratory [[Nomadic pastoralism|pastoral nomads]] from the northeast whom he identified with the [[Amorites]] mentioned in Mesopotamian texts. According to Albright, Abraham was a wandering Amorite who migrated from the north into the central highlands of Canaan and the Negev with his flocks and followers as the Canaanite city-states collapsed. Albright, [[E. A. Speiser]] and [[Cyrus Gordon]] argued that although the texts described by the documentary hypothesis were written centuries after the patriarchal age, archaeology had shown that they were nevertheless an accurate reflection of the conditions of the 2nd millennium BC: "We can assert with full confidence that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were actual historical individuals."&lt;ref&gt;John Bright, "History of Israel", 1972, p.91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern biblical archaeology==
Albright's interpretation came under fierce criticism as archaeology unearthed apparent [[anachronism]]s in the biblical accounts of the patriarchal age, in some cases suggesting that some of the texts were written later than the traditional dates. For example, in Genesis 21:32, Abraham apparently encounters [[Philistines]], who (according to archaeology{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}) actually did not settle in the Middle East until the 12th century BCE. However, usage of future place names had been a known Scriptural phenomenon to Jewish scholars for centuries prior to the biblical criticism movement.&lt;ref name="rashi_ber2"&gt;For instance, the classic tenth-century commentator [[Rashi]] notes that the Bible sometimes refers to places according to the names that later peoples created for them, as in his comment on Gen. 2:14: "Cush and Assyria: As yet they did not exist and Scripture wrote [using] their future names." Similarly in chapter 21, the Bible never actually calls Abimelech and his subjects "Philistines," but only says that they returned to "the land [that would become that] of the Philistines."&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations in the [[Timna Valley]] from 2014 discovered what may be the earliest domesticated [[camel]] bones found in Israel or even anywhere outside the Arabian peninsula, dating to around 930 BCE. This has been described as evidence that the stories of [[Abraham]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], [[Jacob]] and [[Esau]] were written after this time.&lt;ref name=camels&gt;{{cite news| last=Hasson |first=Nir |title=Hump stump solved: Camels arrived in region much later than biblical reference |url= http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/.premium-1.569091 |accessdate=30 January 2014 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=Jan 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sapir-Hen |first=Lidar |author2=Erez Ben-Yosef |title=The Introduction of Domestic Camels to the Southern Levant: Evidence from the Aravah Valley |journal=Tel Aviv |year=2013 |volume=40 |pages=277–285 |url= http://archaeology.tau.ac.il/ben-yosef/pub/Pub_PDFs/Sapir-Hen&amp;Ben-Yosef13_CamelAravah_TelAviv.pdf |accessdate=16 February 2014 |doi= 10.1179/033443513x13753505864089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albright himself saw camels in the Bible as an anachronism.&lt;ref&gt;Heide, Martin. 2011 "The Domestication of the Camel: Biological, Archaeological and Inscriptional Evidence from Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel and Arabia, and Literary Evidence from the Hebrew Bible."

'''Paul Saltman''' (11 April 1928 &amp;ndash; 27 August 1999) was a Professor of Biology at the [[University of California, San Diego]], for more than three decades, and an internationally renowned nutrition expert.  He received a B.S. in chemistry (1949) and Ph.D. in biochemistry (1953) from the [[California Institute of Technology]].  He commenced employment at the [[Keck School of Medicine]] at USC, until 1967, when he accepted the position of provost of [[Revelle College]] at the University of California, San Diego, "to bring undergraduate education to the same high level of academic excellence that marks the graduate program at the heavily science-oriented college."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cen-v049n012.p054 Paul Saltman Frontiersman of science education]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972 Saltman was appointed Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. In 1980, he returned to full-time research and teaching at UCSD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/general/jsaltman.htm NOTED UCSD BIOLOGIST, NUTRITION EXPERT AND ACCLAIMED TEACHER PAUL SALTMAN DIES AUG 27.]&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, from prostate cancer in 1999, the Paul D. Saltman Endowed Chair in Science Education was established by UCSD to recognize a distinguished senior member of Biological Sciences faculty for his/her commitment to, and success in teaching science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biology.ucsd.edu/alumni/biosphere/2010-winter/saltman.html Professor Saltman Lives on in our Hearts and Minds]&lt;/ref&gt;  Saltman was married to Barbara Saltman for over 50 years, and is survived by sons David and Joshua, and five grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.usc.edu/#!/article/8490/Paul-D-Saltman-Biologist-Nutritionist-Dies-at-71/ Paul D. Saltman, Biologist, Nutritionist, Dies at 71]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to nutrition==
Saltman's research focussed on the chemistry, biochemistry and nutritional role of trace metals such as [[iron]], [[copper]], [[zinc]] and [[manganese]].  His approach to nutrition made the point that it is an exact science, and can be accurately measured and tested.  He often clearly differentiated between the concept of eating food, about which he noted: "food is not in itself a science, it is a sensual experience required for survival", and nutrition.  Nutritional requirements, he maintained, could in theory be provided with [[total parenteral nutrition]].  "With TPN feeding all of the nutrients that a human being needs, from the time of infancy to the latter years, one can be maintained alive and well and growing without ever eating a morsel of food or drinking a drop of liquid."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessexcellence.org/WN/NM/saltnm.php Food For Thought: An Interview with Nutrition Scientist Dr. Paul Saltman]&lt;/ref&gt;

His discoveries allowed for improvements in dietary and supplement strategies to prevent anemia, enhance physical performance and decrease the chance of heart disease.   Clinical applications of his research included reduction of free radical damage to hearts, prevention of anemia, enhanced physical performance, and better bone and skeletal metabolism.  His findings were of interest to the food industry and he was a consultant to Procter and Gamble, Mars and other food manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=saltman-paul-cr.xml Saltman, Paul]&lt;/ref&gt;  His academic writings are able to be purchased from Chemical and Engineering News,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/cen-v049n012.p054 C&amp;EN Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; and are also held in the Mandeville Special Collections Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/mscl/ Mandeville Special Collections Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308151218/http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/mscl/ |date=2013-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His 1985 lecture in the [[Leon Pape#Leon Pape Memorial Lecture Series|Leon Pape Memorial Lecture Series]] reflected his overall philosophy, and was titled "Science Is With People: A Tribute to Leon Pape".

He was an advocate of eating all types of food, including red meat and occasional "[[junk food]]", while always stressing the importance of exercise and supplements.  He wrote "The University of California San Diego Nutrition Book" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3967318-the-university-of-california-san-diego-nutrition-book The University of California San Diego Nutrition Book]&lt;/ref&gt; as a popular science book for the layperson, and believed that science has a duty to assist and educate not only university students, but also the general public.  He was "the antithesis of the ivory tower academic, and expanded his role as a teacher to include the public at large. He did a half-hour series called "Patterns of Life" for National Educational Television and a series for PBS."&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1999/aug/28/news/mn-4442 Paul Saltman; UC San Diego Biochemist, Innovator]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also considered an outstanding teacher, and an inspiration to his students. Robert C. Dynes, UCSD Chancellor wrote of him : " His love of learning, his enthusiasm for science, his communication skills, made him a role model for students and faculty alike. My tenure here has been enriched by knowing him—by his advice, his personal integrity, his passion for teaching and for life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/general/jsaltman.htm NOTED UCSD BIOLOGIST, NUTRITION EXPERT ACCLAIMED TEACHER PAUL SALTMAN DIES AUG 27.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal Appearance==

Dr. Saltman appeared as a contestant on the 22 October 1959 episode of Groucho Marx's TV quiz program "[[You Bet Your Life]]".  He won $300 and his wit and charm made him a delightful guest.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks_Mq3A-jk0&amp;index=87&amp;list=PLHaioNpr_GDbvsTj_taM-jO6C1658N1PC&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[botany]], '''phyllotaxis''' or '''phyllotaxy''' is the arrangement of [[leaf|leaves]] on a [[plant]] [[plant stem|stem]] (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{transl|grc|phýllon}} "leaf" and {{transl|grc|táxis}} "arrangement").&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|fu/llon|φύλλον}}, {{LSJ|ta/cis|τάξις|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phyllotactic spirals form a distinctive class of [[patterns in nature]].

The basic [[leaf#Arrangement on the stem|arrangements of leaves on a stem]] are '''opposite''' and '''alternate''' (also known as '''spiral'''). Leaves may also be '''[[Whorl (botany)|whorled]]''' if several leaves arise, or appear to arise, from the same level (at the same [[Node (botany)|node]]) on a stem. 

[[File:Veronicastrum virg album C.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Veronicastrum virginicum]]'' has whorls of leaves separated by long internodes.]]

With an opposite leaf arrangement, two leaves arise from the stem at the same level (at the same [[Node (botany)|node]]), on opposite sides of the stem. An opposite leaf pair can be thought of as a whorl of two leaves.

With an alternate (spiral) pattern, each leaf arises at a different point (node) on the stem.

[[File:Clivia-GreenPlants.ca.jpg|thumb|right|Distichous leaf arrangement in ''[[Clivia]]'']]

'''Distichous''' phyllotaxis, also called "two-ranked leaf arrangement" is a special case of either opposite or alternate leaf arrangement where the leaves on a stem are arranged in two vertical columns on opposite sides of the stem. Examples include various [[bulb|bulbous plants]] such as ''[[Boophone]]''. It also occurs in other plant [[Habit (biology)|habits]] such as those of ''[[Gasteria]]'' or ''[[Aloe]]'' seedlings, and also in mature plants of related species such as ''[[Kumara plicatilis]]'' (''Aloe plicatilis'').
[[File:Lithops 2.jpg|thumb|A ''Lithops'' species, showing its decussate growth in which a single pair of leaves is replaced at a time, leaving just one live active pair of leaves as the old pair withers]]
In an opposite pattern, if successive leaf pairs are 90 degrees apart, this habit is called [[decussate]]. It is common in members of the family [[Crassulaceae]]&lt;ref name="Eggli2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Urs Eggli|title=Illustrated Handbook of Succulent Plants: Crassulaceae|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nU7mCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-55874-0|pages=40–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decussate phyllotaxis also occurs in the [[Aizoaceae]]. In genera of the Aizoaceae, such as [[Lithops]] and [[Conophytum]], many species have just two fully developed leaves at a time, the older pair folding back and dying off to make room for the decussately oriented new pair as the plant grows.&lt;ref name="Hartmann2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heidrun E.K. Hartmann|title=Illustrated Handbook of Succulent Plants: Aizoaceae A–E|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7oHuCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-56306-5|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ulistnienie (Phyllotaxys opposite-decussate).png|thumb|upright|A decussate leaf pattern]]
[[File:Crassula rupestris-PICT3087.jpg|thumb|Decussate phyllotaxis of ''Crassula rupestris'']]

The whorled arrangement is fairly unusual on plants except for those with particularly short [[internode (botany)|internodes]]. Examples of trees with whorled phyllotaxis are ''[[Brabejum stellatifolium]]''&lt;ref name= "Marloth4"&gt;Marloth, Rudolf. The Flora of South Africa” 1932 Pub. Capetown: Darter Bros. London: Wheldon &amp; Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; and the related genus ''[[Macadamia]]''.&lt;ref name= "RHSDict"&gt;Chittenden, Fred J. Ed., Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of Gardening, Oxford 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

A whorl can occur as a [[anatomical terms of location|basal]] structure where all the leaves are attached at the base of the shoot and the internodes are small or nonexistent. A basal whorl with a large number of leaves spread out in a circle is called a [[Rosette (botany)|rosette]].

The rotational angle from leaf to leaf in a repeating spiral can be represented by a fraction of a full rotation around the stem.

Alternate distichous leaves will have an angle of 1/2 of a full rotation. In [[beech]] and [[hazel]] the angle is 1/3, in [[oak]] and [[apricot]] it is 2/5, in [[sunflowers]], [[Populus|poplar]], and [[pear]], it is 3/8, and in [[willow]] and [[almond]] the angle is 5/13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to geometry|first=H. S. M. |last=Coxeter|author-link =Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|publisher =Wiley|year=1961|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numerator and denominator normally consist of a  [[Fibonacci number]] and its second successor. The number of leaves is sometimes called rank, in the case of simple Fibonacci ratios, because the leaves line up in vertical rows. With larger Fibonacci pairs,  the pattern becomes complex and non-repeating. This tends to occur with a basal configuration. Examples can be found in [[Asteraceae|composite]] [[flower]]s and [[seed]] heads.  The most famous example is the [[sunflower]] head.  This phyllotactic pattern creates an optical effect of criss-crossing spirals. In the botanical literature, these designs are described by the number of counter-clockwise spirals and the number of clockwise spirals. These also turn out to be [[Fibonacci numbers]]. In some cases, the numbers appear to be multiples of Fibonacci numbers because the spirals consist of whorls.

==Determination==
The pattern of leaves on a plant is ultimately controlled by the local depletion of the plant hormone [[auxin]] in certain areas of the [[meristem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Traas J, Vernoux T |title=The shoot apical meristem: the dynamics of a stable structure |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=357 |issue=1422 |pages=737–47 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12079669 |pmc=1692983 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1091 |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12079669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaves become initiated in localized areas where auxin is absent.{{Disputed inline|More mechanisms please|date=May 2016}} When a leaf is initiated and begins development, auxin begins to flow towards it, thus depleting auxin from another area on the meristem where a new leaf is to be initiated. This gives rise to a self-propagating system that is ultimately controlled by the ebb and flow of auxin in different regions of the meristematic topography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith, RS |title=The role of Auxin Transport in Plant Patterning Mechanisms |journal=PLoS Biol.  |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=e323 |year=2008 |pmid=19090623 |pmc=2602727 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Insight into the mechanism had to wait until [[Wilhelm Hofmeister]] proposed a model in 1868. A [[primordium]], the nascent leaf, forms at the least crowded part of the shoot meristem. The [[golden angle]] between successive leaves is the blind result of this jostling. Since three golden arcs add up to slightly more than enough to wrap a circle, this guarantees that no two leaves ever follow the same radial line from center to edge. The generative spiral is a consequence of the same process that produces the clockwise and counter-clockwise spirals that emerge in densely packed plant structures, such as ''[[Protea]]'' flower disks or pinecone scales.

In modern times, researchers such as Snow and Snow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Snow, M. |author2=Snow, R. |year=1934 |title=The interpretation of Phyllotaxis |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=132–137 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.1934.tb00876.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; have continued these lines of inquiry. Computer modeling and morphological studies have confirmed and refined Hoffmeister's ideas. Questions remain about the details. Botanists are divided on whether the control of leaf migration depends on chemical [[gradient]]s among the primordia or purely mechanical forces. [[Lucas numbers|Lucas]] rather than Fibonacci numbers have been observed in a few plants{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} and occasionally the leaf positioning appears to be random.

==Mathematics==

Physical models of phyllotaxis date back to [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]]'s experiment of packing hard spheres. [[Gerrit van Iterson]] diagrammed grids imagined on a cylinder (Rhombic Lattices).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/History/VanIterson01.html | title=History | publisher=Smith College  | accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douady et al. showed that phyllotactic patterns emerge as self-organizing processes in dynamic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Douady S, Couder Y |title=Phyllotaxis as a physical self-organized growth process |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=68 |issue=13 |pages=2098–2101 |date=March 1992 |pmid=10045303 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v68/p2098 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.68.2098 |bibcode=1992PhRvL..68.2098D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Levitov proposed that lowest energy configurations of repulsive particles in cylindrical geometries reproduce the spirals of botanical phyllotaxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levitov LS |title=Energetic Approach to Phyllotaxis |journal=Europhys.

(2009) showed that to be true by constructing a "magnetic cactus" made of magnetic dipoles mounted on bearings stacked along a "stem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nisoli C, Gabor NM, Lammert PE, Maynard JD, Crespi VH |title=Static and dynamical phyllotaxis in a magnetic cactus |journal=Phys.

Close packing of spheres generates a dodecahedral tessellation with pentaprismic faces. Pentaprismic symmetry is related to the Fibonacci series and the [[golden section]] of classical geometry.&lt;ref name="Matila Ghyka 1946"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Geometry of Art and Life |author=Matila Ghyka |publisher=Dover |isbn=0-486-23542-4 |url=http://store.doverpublications.com/0486235424.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Adler|first=Irving|title=Solving the Riddle of Phyllotaxis: Why the Fibonacci Numbers and the Golden Ratio Occur On Plants|url=http://www.worldscibooks.com/mathematics/8500.html|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''problem of the creator of God''' is the controversy regarding the hypothetical [[Causality|cause]] responsible for the [[existence of God]], presuming God exists. A common challenge to [[theism|theistic]] propositions of a [[creator deity]] as a necessary [[first cause|first-cause]] explanation for the [[universe]] is the question: "Who created God?".&lt;ref&gt;''The God Book'', [[Michael Arnheim]], 2015, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; It contests the proposition that the universe cannot exist without a creator by asserting that the creator of the universe must have the same restrictions. This, in turn, may lead to a problem of [[infinite regress]] wherein each newly presumed creator of a creator is itself presumed to have its own creator.

Some faith traditions have such an element as part of their doctrine. [[Jainism and non-creationism|Jainism]] posits that the universe is eternal and has always existed. In [[Mormonism]] it is believed that the God of this Earth was once a mortal human, who had a father of his own. [[Ismailism]] rejects the idea of God as the ''first cause'', due to the doctrine of God's incomparability and source of any existence including [[Abstract and concrete|abstract objects]].&lt;ref&gt;Arzina R. Lalani Degrees of Excellence: A Fatimid Treatise on Leadership in Islam I.B.Tauris 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-857-71202-8}} page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==
[[Rajneesh|Osho]] writes:
{{quote|No, don't ask that. That's what all the religions say — don't ask who created God. But this is strange — why not? If the question is valid about existence, why does it become invalid when it is applied to God? And once you ask who created God, you are falling into a regress absurdum.&lt;ref&gt;''The God Conspiracy: The Path from Superstition to Super Consciousness'', [[Rajneesh|Osho]], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Humphreys writes:
{{quote|... if someone were able to provide the explanation, we would be forced to embark upon what philosophers call an infinite regress. Having established who created God, we would then have to answer the question of who created God's creator.&lt;ref&gt;''In God We Doubt'', John Humphrys, 2008. {{isbn|978-0340976739}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''The God Book'', Deist [[Michael Arnheim]] writes:
{{quote|The atheist objection is that if God created the universe, who created God? Judging by the number of times that [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins]] repeats this same point in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', one must assume that he sees this as a killer argument against the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;''The God Book'', [[Michael Arnheim]], 2015, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alan Lurie writes:
{{quote|If God created the Universe, who created God? That is a dilemma that religious folks desperately try to avoid.” The question, “Who created God?”, has been pondered by theologians for millennia, and the answer is both surprisingly obvious and philosophically subtle...

...whatever one thinks about the beginnings of the Universe, there is “something” at the very origin that was not created. This is an inescapable given a cosmic truth.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Lurie, ''The Rabbi Who Believes in Zeus: Popular Myths About Religion, Faith, and God'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Responses==
Defenders of religion have countered that the question is improper:

{{quote|We ask, “If all things have a creator, then who created God?” Actually, only created things have a creator, so it's improper to lump God with his creation. God has revealed himself to us in the Bible as having always existed.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Husting, ''Doubt Busters'', 2017, p. 20. {{isbn|1387312820}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is also argued that the question becomes irrelevant if the Universe is presumed to have circular time instead of linear time.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gabler, ''Slices of a Life'', 2015, Ch. 30 {{isbn|1504960645}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quantasomes''' are particles found in the [[thylakoid membrane]] of [[chloroplast]]s in which [[photosynthesis]] takes place. They are embedded in a paracrystalline array on the surface of thylakoid discs in chloroplasts. They are composed of lipids and proteins that include various photosynthetic pigments and redox carriers. For this reason they are considered to be photosynthetic units. They occur in 2 sizes: the smaller quantasome is thought to represent the site of photosystem I, the larger to represent the site of photosystem II.

Quantasomes were first identified by [[Roderic B. Park]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="Smith-1977"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft796nb4n2&amp;chunk.id=d0e5234&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=0&amp;brand=eschol&amp;query=quantasome | title = Chapter 4 — Chloroplasts—Structure and Photosynthesis | work = The Molecular Biology of Plant Cells | publisher = [[University of California Press]] | year = 1977 | first = H. | last = Smith | lccn = 77-73503 | isbn = 0-520-03465-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Park-1962"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed039p424 | title = Advances in photosynthesis | first = Roderic B. | last = Park | date = August 1962 | journal = [[Journal of Chemical Education]] | volume = 39 | number = 8 | pages = 424 | doi = 10.1021/ed039p424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quantitative marketing research''' is the application of quantitative research techniques to the field of marketing. It has roots in both the [[positivism|positivist]] view of the world, and the modern marketing viewpoint that marketing is an interactive process in which both the buyer and seller reach a satisfying agreement on the "[[Marketing mix|four Ps]]" of marketing: Product, Price, Place (location) and Promotion.

As a [[social research]] method, it typically involves the construction of [[questionnaire]]s and [[scale (social sciences)|scales]]. People who respond (respondents) are asked to complete the [[statistical survey|survey]]. [[Marketing|Marketers]] use the information to obtain and understand the needs of individuals in the marketplace, and to create [[strategic planning|strategies]] and [[marketing plan]]s.

==Typical general procedure==
Simply put, there are five major and important steps involved in the research process:

#Defining the problem.
#[[Experimental design|Research design]].
#[[Data collection]].
#[[Data analysis]].
#[[Report writing]] &amp; presentation.

A brief discussion on these steps is:

# Problem audit and problem definition - What is the problem? What are the various aspects of the problem? What information is needed?
# Conceptualization and operationalization - How exactly do we define the concepts involved? How do we translate these concepts into observable and measurable behaviours?
# [[Hypothesis]] specification - What claim(s) do we want to test?
# Research design specification - What type of methodology to use? - examples: questionnaire, survey

# Data collection - Use mail, telephone, internet, mall intercepts
# Codification and re-specification - Make adjustments to the raw data so it is compatible with statistical techniques and with the objectives of the research - examples: assigning numbers, consistency checks, substitutions, deletions, weighting, dummy variables, scale transformations, scale standardization
# Statistical analysis - Perform various descriptive and inferential techniques (see below) on the raw data. Make inferences from the sample to the whole population. Test the results for statistical significance.
# Interpret and integrate findings - What do the results mean? What conclusions can be drawn? How do these findings relate to similar research?
# Write the research report - Report usually has headings such as: 1) executive summary; 2) objectives; 3) methodology; 4) main findings; 5) detailed charts and diagrams. Present the report to the client in a 10-minute presentation. Be prepared for questions.

The design step may involve a pilot study in order to discover any hidden issues. The codification and analysis steps are typically performed by computer, using [[List of statistical packages|statistical software]].  The data collection steps, can in some instances be automated, but often require significant manpower to undertake.  Interpretation is a skill mastered only by experience.

==Statistical analysis==

The data acquired for quantitative marketing research can be analysed by almost any of the range of techniques of [[statistical analysis]], which can be broadly divided into [[descriptive statistics]] and [[statistical inference]]. An important set of techniques is that related to [[statistical survey]]s. In any instance, an appropriate type of statistical analysis should take account of the various types of error that may arise, as outlined below.

===Reliability and validity===

Research should be tested for [[reliability (psychometric)|reliability]], generalizability, and [[validity (psychometric)|validity]].

'''Generalizability''' is the ability to make inferences from a sample to the population.

'''Reliability''' is the extent to which a measure will produce consistent results.
* ''Test-retest reliability'' checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated under similar circumstances. Stability over repeated measures is assessed with the Pearson coefficient.
* ''Alternative forms reliability'' checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated using different forms.
* ''Internal consistency reliability'' checks how well the individual measures included in the research are converted into a composite measure. Internal consistency may be assessed by correlating performance on two halves of a test (split-half reliability). The value of the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] is adjusted with the [[Spearman–Brown prediction formula]] to correspond to the correlation between two full-length tests. A commonly used measure is [[Cronbach's alpha|Cronbach's α]], which is equivalent to the mean of all possible split-half coefficients. Reliability may be improved by increasing the sample size.

'''Validity''' asks whether the research measured what it intended to.
* ''Content validation'' (also called face validity) checks how well the content of the research are related to the variables to be studied; it seeks to answer whether the research questions are representative of the variables being researched. It is a demonstration that the items of a test are drawn from the domain being measured.
* ''Criterion validation'' checks how meaningful the research criteria are relative to other possible criteria. When the criterion is collected later the goal is to establish predictive validity.
* ''Construct validation'' checks what underlying construct is being measured. There are three variants of construct validity: ''convergent validity'' (how well the research relates to other measures of the same construct), ''discriminant validity'' (how poorly the research relates to measures of opposing constructs), and ''nomological validity'' (how well the research relates to other variables as required by theory).
* ''Internal validation'', used primarily in experimental research designs, checks the relation between the dependent and independent variables (i.e. Did the experimental manipulation of the independent variable actually cause the observed results?)
* ''External validation'' checks whether the experimental results can be generalized.

Validity implies reliability: A valid measure must be reliable. Reliability does not necessarily imply validity, however: A reliable measure does not imply that it is valid.

===Types of errors===

'''Random sampling errors:'''
*sample too small
*sample not representative
*inappropriate sampling method used
*[[errors and residuals in statistics|random errors]]
'''Research design errors:'''
*bias introduced
*measurement error
*data analysis error
*sampling frame error
*population definition error
*scaling error
*question construction error
'''Interviewer errors:'''
*recording errors
*cheating errors
*questioning errors
*respondent selection error
'''Respondent errors:'''
*non-response error
*inability error
*falsification error
'''Hypothesis errors:'''
*[[Type I and type II errors#Type I error|type I error]] (also called alpha error)
**the study results lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis even though it is actually true
*[[Type I and type II errors#Type II error|type II error]] (also called beta error)
**the study results lead to the acceptance (non-rejection) of the null hypothesis even though it is actually false

In [[condensed matter physics]], a '''string-net''' is an extended object whose collective behavior has been proposed as a physical mechanism for [[topological order]] by [[Michael A. Levin]] and [[Xiao-Gang Wen]]. A particular string-net model may involve only closed loops; or networks of oriented, labeled strings obeying branching rules given by some [[gauge group]]; or still more general networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levin, Michael A. |author2=Xiao-Gang Wen |last-author-amp=yes |title=String-net condensation: A physical mechanism for topological phases |journal=Physical Review B |volume=71 |issue=45110 |pages=21 |date=12 January 2005|arxiv=cond-mat/0404617 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.71.045110 |bibcode=2005PhRvB..71d5110L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The string-net model is claimed to show the derivation of photons, electrons, and U(1) gauge charge, small (relative to the [[Planck mass]]) but nonzero masses, and suggestions that the [[leptons]], [[quarks]], and [[gluons]]  can be modeled in the same way. In other words, string-net condensation provides a unified origin for [[photons]] and [[electrons]] (or [[gauge bosons]] and [[fermions]]). It can be viewed as an origin of [[light]] and [[electron]] (or [[gauge bosons|gauge interactions]] and [[Fermi statistics]]).
However, their model does not account for the [[chiral]] coupling between the [[fermions]] and the SU(2) [[gauge bosons]] in the [[standard model]].

For strings labeled by the positive integers, string-nets are the [[spin network]]s studied in [[loop quantum gravity]]. This has led to the proposal by Levin and Wen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Journal |title=Photons and electrons as emergent phenomena |first1=Michael |last1=Levin |first2=Xiao-Gang |last2=Wen |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0407140.pdf |journal=Rev. Mod. Phys. |volume=77 |pages=871-879 [878] |date=2005 |quote=loop quantum gravity appears to be a string net condensation … |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.77.871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Smolin, Markopoulou and Konopka&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=hep-th/0611197 |quote=We argue (but do not prove) that under certain conditions the spins in the system can arrange themselves in regular, lattice-like patterns at low temperatures. |first1=Tomasz |last1=Konopka |first2=Fotini |last2=Markopoulou |first3=Lee |last3=Smolin |title=Quantum Graphity |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0611197.pdf |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; that loop quantum gravity's spin networks can give rise to the [[standard model]] of [[particle physics]] through this mechanism, along with [[fermi statistics]] and [[gauge bosons|gauge interactions]]. To date, a rigorous derivation from LQG's spin networks to Levin and Wen's spin lattice has yet to be done, but the project to do so is called [[Event symmetry#Quantum_graphity_and_other_random_graph_models|quantum graphity]], and in a more recent paper, Tomasz Konopka, [[Fotini Markopoulou]], [[Simone Severini]] argued that there are some similarities to spin networks (but not necessarily an exact equivalence) that gives rise to U(1) gauge charge and electrons in the string net mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Quantum graphity: A model of emergent locality |first1=Tomasz |last1=Konopka |first2=Fotini |last2=Markopoulou |first3=Simone |last3=Severini |journal=Phys.

In [[computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]], a '''swap chain''' is a series of virtual [[framebuffer]]s utilized by the [[graphics card]] and graphics [[API]] for [[frame rate]] stabilization and several other functions.  The swap chain usually exists in [[Video card#Video memory|graphics memory]], but it can exist in system memory as well.  The non-utilization of a swap chain may result in stuttering [[real Time rendering|rendering]], but its existence and utilization are required by many graphics APIs.  A swap chain with two buffers is a [[double buffer]].
__NOTOC__
==Function==
[[File:swap chain depiction.svg|thumb|alt=Swap Chain|A graphical depiction of a triple-buffered swap chain.]]
In every swap chain there are at least two buffers. The first framebuffer, the screenbuffer, is the buffer that is [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]] to the output of the [[video card]]. The remaining buffers are known as backbuffers. Each time a new [[Film frame|frame]] is displayed, the first backbuffer in the swap chain takes the place of the screenbuffer, this is called ''presentation'' or ''swapping''. A variety of other actions may be taken on the previous screenbuffer and other backbuffers (if they exist). The screenbuffer may be simply [[Overwriting (Computer Science)|overwritten]] or returned to the back of the swap chain for further processing.  The action taken is decided by the [[client (computing)|client]] application and is API dependent.

===Direct3D===
[[Microsoft]] [[Direct3D]] implements a SwapChain class.  Each host device has at least one swap chain assigned to it, and others may be created by the client application.&lt;ref name="msnd 0"&gt;
{{cite web
 | title = SwapChain Class
 | publisher = Microsoft
 | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.windowsmobile.directx.direct3d.swapchain.aspx
 | accessdate = 30 October 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The API provides three methods of swapping: copy, discard, and flip. When the SwapChain is set to flip, the screenbuffer is copied onto the last backbuffer, then all the existing backbuffers are copied forward in the chain. When copy is set, each backbuffer is copied forward, but the screenbuffer is not wrapped to the last buffer, leaving it unchanged. Flip does not work when there is only one backbuffer, as the screenbuffer is copied over the only backbuffer before it can be presented. In discard mode, the driver selects the best method.&lt;ref name="nexe 0"&gt;

 | publisher = neXe
 | url = http://nexe.gamedev.net/directKnowledge/default.asp?p=Swap%20Chains
 | accessdate = 2015-05-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with Triple Buffering===
Outside the context of Direct3D, [[triple buffering]] refers to the technique of allowing an application to draw to whichever back buffer was least recently updated. This allows the application to always proceed with rendering, regardless of the pace at which frames are being drawn by the application or the pace at which frames are being sent to the display. Triple Buffering may result in a frame being discarded without being displayed if two or more newer frames are completely rendered in the time it takes for one frame to be sent to the display. By contrast, Direct3D swap chains are a strict [[Queue (abstract data type)|first-in, first-out queue]], so every frame that is drawn by the application will be displayed even if newer frames are available. Direct3D does not implement a most-recent buffer swapping strategy, and Microsoft's documentation calls a Direct3D swap chain of three buffers "triple buffering". Triple Buffering as described above is superior for interactive purposes such as gaming, but Direct3D swap chains of more than three buffers can be better for tasks such as presenting frames of a video where the time taken to [[Data Compression#Video|decode]] each frame may be highly variable.&lt;ref name="anandtech 0"&gt;

{{refimprove|date=October 2018}}
'''Taoist sexual practices''' ({{lang-zh|s=房中术|t=房中術|p=fángzhōngshù}}), literally "the bedroom arts", are the ways [[Taoism|Taoists]] may practice [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].  These practices are also known as "Joining Energy" or "The Joining of the Essences".  Practitioners believe that by performing these sexual arts, one can stay in good health, and attain longevity or spiritual advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/heart-and-soul-healing/201210/tantric-and-taoist-practices-improve-sex|title=Tantric and Taoist Practices to Improve Sex|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr STEVEN LIU and JONATHAN BLANK SECRETS OF DRAGON GATE 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreattao.com/html/taoofsexology.html|title=Tao of Sexology: Sexual Wisdom and Methods|website=www.thegreattao.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Some Taoist sects during the [[Han dynasty]] performed [[sexual intercourse]] as a spiritual practice, called "Héqì" (合氣], "Joining Energy"){{cn|date=October 2018}}. The first sexual texts that survive today are those found at the [[Mawangdui]]{{cn|date=October 2018}}. While [[Taoism]] had not yet fully evolved as a philosophy at this time, these texts shared some remarkable similarities with later [[Tang dynasty]] texts, such as the [[Ishinpō|Ishinpō (醫心方)]]. The sexual arts arguably reached their climax between the end of the [[Han dynasty]] and the end of the Tang dynasty{{cn|date=October 2018}}. 

After 1000 AD, [[Confucian]] restraining attitudes towards sexuality became stronger, so that by the beginning of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1644, sex was a [[taboo]] topic in public life{{cn|date=October 2018}}. These Confucians alleged that the separation of genders in most social activities existed 2,000 years ago, and suppressed the sexual arts. Because of the [[taboo]] surrounding sex, there was much [[censorship|censoring]] done during the Qing in literature, and the sexual arts disappeared in public life{{cn|date=October 2018}}. As a result, some of the [[Document|texts]] survived only in [[Japan]], and most scholars had no idea that such a different concept of sex existed in [[History of China|early China]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Gulik (1961), preface&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient and medieval practices==

===Qi (lifeforce) and jing (essence)===
The basis of all Taoist thinking is that [[qi| qi (氣)]] is part of everything in existence.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Qi is related to another energetic substance contained in the human body known as [[jing (TCM)|jing (精)]], and once all this has been expended the body dies. Jing can be lost in many ways, but most notably through the loss of body fluids. Taoists may use practices to stimulate/increase and conserve their bodily fluids to great extents.  The fluid believed to contain the most Jing is semen. Therefore, Taoists believe in decreasing the frequency of, or totally avoiding, ejaculation in order to conserve life essence.&lt;ref name="Wile 1992, p. 6"&gt;Wile (1992), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male control of ejaculation===
Many [[Taoist]] practitioners link the loss of ejaculatory fluids to the loss of vital life force: where excessive fluid loss results in premature aging, disease, and general fatigue.  While some Taoists contend that one should never ejaculate, others provide a specific formula to determine the maximum amount of regular [[ejaculation]]s in order to maintain health.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general idea is to limit the loss of fluids as much as possible to the level of your desired practice.  As these sexual practices were passed down over the [[centuries]], some practitioners have given less importance to the limiting of ejaculation.  Nevertheless, the "retention of the [[semen]]" is one of the foundational tenets of Taoist sexual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different methods to control ejaculation prescribed by the Taoists. In order to avoid [[ejaculation]], the man could do one of several things. He could pull out immediately before [[orgasm]], a method which [[Joseph Needham]] termed "coitus conservatus".&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1983), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; A second method involved the man applying pressure on the [[perineum]], thus retaining the sperm. While, if done incorrectly can cause a [[retrograde ejaculation]], the Taoists believed that the jing traveled up into the head and "nourished the brain."&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1993), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jing===
Another important concept of "The Joining of the Essences" was that the union of a man and a woman would result in the creation of [[jing (TCM)|jing (精)]], a type of sexual energy. When in the act of lovemaking, jing would form, and the man could transform some of this jing into qi, and replenish his lifeforce. By having as much sex as possible, men had the opportunity to transform more and more jing, and as a result would see many health benefits.&lt;ref name="Wile 1992, p. 6"/&gt;

===Yin/Yang===

The concept of [[Yin and yang]] is important in Taoism, and consequently also holds special importance in sex. Yang usually referred to the male sex, whereas Yin could refer to the female sex. Man and Woman were the equivalent of heaven and earth, but became disconnected. Therefore, while heaven and earth are eternal, man and woman suffer a premature death.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  Every interaction between Yin and Yang had significance. Because of this significance, every position and action in lovemaking had importance. Taoist texts described a large number of special sexual positions that served to cure or prevent illness.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===

For Taoists, sex was not just about pleasing the man{{cn|date=October 2018}}. The woman also had to be stimulated and pleased in order to benefit from the act of sex{{cn|date=October 2018}}. Sex should not happen if one or the other partners desire it more. If sex were performed in this manner, the woman would create more jing, and the man could more easily absorb the jing to increase his own qi. Women were also given a prominent place in the [[Ishinpō]], with the tutor being a woman. One of the reasons women had a great deal of strength in the act of sex was that they walked away undiminished from the act. The woman had the power to bring forth life, and did not have to worry about ejaculation or refractory period{{cn|date=October 2018}}.

Women were often given a position of inferiority in sexual practice{{cn|date=October 2018}}. Many of the texts{{which|date=October 2018}} discuss sex from a male point of view, and avoid discussing how sex could benefit women. Men were encouraged to not limit themselves to one woman, and were advised to have sex only with the woman who was beautiful and not yet produced children. While the man had to please the woman sexually, she was still just an object.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; At numerous points during the Ishinpō, the woman is referred to as the "enemy"; this was because the woman could cause him to spill semen and lose vitality. In later sexual texts from the Ming, women had lost all semblance of being human and were referred to as the "other," "crucible", or "stove" from which to cultivate vitality.  The importance of pleasing the woman was also diminished in later texts.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was known as ([[:zh:采阴补阳|Caibu (採補)]]), as a man enters many women without ejaculation.

Women were also considered to be a means for men to extend men's lives{{cn}. Many of the ancient texts were dedicated explanation of how a man could use sex to extend his own life. But, his life was extended only through the absorption of the woman's vital energies (jing and qi). Some Taoists called the act of sex “The battle of stealing and strengthening.”&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; These sexual methods could be correlated with Taoist military methods. Instead of storming the gates, the battle was a series of feints and maneuvers that would sap the enemy's resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===When and where===

Another text, ''Health Benefits of the Bedchamber''{{cn|date=October 2018}}, indicates that certain times were better for [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] than others. A person had to avoid having [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] on [[Quarter moon|quarter]] or [[full moon]]s and on [[days]] when there were great [[winds]], [[rain]], [[fog]], [[cold]] or [[heat]], [[thunder]], [[lightning]], [[darkness]] over [[heaven and earth]]{{dn|date=October 2018}}, [[solar eclipses|solar]] and [[lunar eclipses]], [[rainbow]]s and [[earthquake]]s. Having intercourse at these times would harm a [[man]]'s spirit and would cause [[women]] to become [[illness|ill]]. [[Children]] [[Fertilisation|conceived]] at these times would be [[wikt:mad|mad]], [[stupid]], [[perverse]] or [[wikt:foolish|foolish]]; [[Muteness|mute]], [[deaf]], [[crippled]] or [[Visual impairment|blind]]; [[Filial piety|unfilial]] and [[violent]]{{dubious|date=October 2018}}.

Also important was selecting the right day for intercourse if a person desired children. After the woman's [[menstrual period|period]], the first, third or fifth days were the best. If on these days the man [[ejaculation|ejaculated]] after [[midnight]], the child would likely be male. If a female child was desired, the man needed to ejaculate on the second, fourth or sixth days after the cessation of the woman's [[menstrual period|period]]{{cn|date=October 2018}}.

The location of [[sex|sexual intercourse]] was also important. People had to avoid the glare of the [[sun]], [[moon]] or [[stars]], the interior of [[shrines]], proximity to [[temples]], [[Water well|wells]], [[stoves]] and [[wikt:privy|privies]], and the vicinity of [[grave]]s or [[coffin]]s{{cn|date=October 2018}}.

If these suggestions were followed "the family's offspring would be [[good]], wise and [[virtuous]]". If they were not followed, "the [[offspring]] would be [[evil]] and the [[family]] would eventually die off".&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longevity and immortality===
Some [[Ming dynasty]] Taoist [[sect]]s believed that one way for men to achieve longevity or 'towards immortality' is by having intercourse with [[virgin]]s, particularly young virgins. Taoist sexual books, such as the ''Hsuan wei Hshin'' ("Mental Images of the Mysteries and Subtleties of Sexual Techniques") and ''San Feng Tan Cheueh'' ("Zhang Sanfeng's Instructions in the Physiological Alchemy"), written, respectively, by Zhao Liangpi and Zhang Sanfeng (not to be confused with semi-mythical [[Zhang Sanfeng]] who lived in an earlier period), call the woman sexual partner ''[[Ding (vessel)|ding]]'' ([[wiktionary:鼎|鼎]]) and recommend sex with [[menarche|premenarche]] virgins. Zhao Liangpi concludes that the ideal ''ding'' is a premenarche virgin just under 14 years of age and women older than 18 should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mental Images of the Mysteries and Subtleties of Sexual Techniques |first1=Zhao |last1=Lianpi |first2=Hsuan Wei |last2=Hshin}} (published before 1850)&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang Sanfeng went further and divided ''ding'' into three ranks: the lowest rank, 21- to 25-year-old women; the middle rank, 16- to 20-year-old [[Menstruation|menstruating]] virgins; the highest rank, 14-year-old premenarche virgins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=XyChBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56 |author-link=Ruan Fangfu |first=Fang Fu |last=Ruan |editor-first=Molleen |editor-last=Matsumura |title=Sex in China: Studies in Sexology in Chinese Culture |date=31 October 1991 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |chapter=The Value of Virgins as Sex Partners |page=56 |quote=Almost all Taoist sex handbooks recommend that the "ding" should be a girl of 14 to 16, just before or after menarch. In Zhang '''Sanfeng''''s Instructions in Physiological Alchemy, "ding" were classified into three ranks. The lowest rank comprised women between the ages of 21 and 25. The middle rank compromised 16- to 20-year-old virgins after menarch. The highest rank comprised 14-year-old virgins before menarch.}} ("The Role of Sexual Lore in Taoism" begins on page 50, this is a 2013 edition of a 1991 book)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEN/CH23.HTM#b1-TAOISM%20AND%20SEX |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021216190909/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEN/CH23.HTM |archive-date=16 December 2002 |title=Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia |section=Taoism and Sex |quote=The Taoist sexual books, such as the Hsuan wei Hshin (Mental Images of the Mysteries and Subtleties of Sexual Techniques') and San Feng Tan Cheueh (Zhang Sanfeng's Instructions in the Physiological Alchemy), written, respectively, by Zhao '''Liang Pi''' and Zhang '''San Feng''', state that the most desirable ding is a girl about 14, 15, or 16 years old just before or after menarche. Zhang '''Sanfeng''' went further and divided ding into three ranks: the lowest rank, 21- to 25-year-old women; the middle rank, 16- to 20-year-old menstruating virgin girls; and the highest rank, 14-year-old premenarche virgin girls.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ge Hong]], a 4th-century Taoist [[alchemy|alchemist]], "those seeking 'immortality' must perfect the absolute essentials. These consist of treasuring the jing, circulating the qi and consuming the great medicine."&lt;ref name="Wile 1992, p. 24"&gt;Wile (1992), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual arts concerned the first precept, treasuring the jing. This is partially because treasuring the jing involved sending it up into the brain. In order to send the jing into the brain, the male had to refrain from ejaculation during sex. According to some Taoists, if this was done, the jing would travel up the spine and nourish the brain instead of leaving the body. Ge Hong also states, however, that it is folly to believe that performing the sexual arts only can achieve immortality and some of the ancient myths on sexual arts had been misinterpreted and exaggerated. Indeed, the sexual arts had to be practiced alongside [[alchemy]] to attain longevity. Ge Hong also warned it could be dangerous if practiced incorrectly.&lt;ref name="Wile 1992, p. 24"/&gt;

Transduction in the [[nervous system]] typically refers to stimulus-alerting events wherein a physical stimulus is converted into an [[action potential]], which is transmitted along axons towards the central nervous system for integration.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41266312|title=Molecular cell biology|date=2000|publisher=W.H. Freeman|others=Lodish, Harvey F.|isbn=0716731363|edition= 4th|location=New York|oclc=41266312}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a step in the larger process of [[sensory processing]].

A receptor cell converts the energy in a stimulus into an electrical signal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Receptors are broadly split into two main categories: exteroceptors, which receive external sensory stimuli, and interoceptors, which receive internal sensory stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exteroceptor|title=Definition of EXTEROCEPTOR|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interoceptor|title=Definition of INTEROCEPTOR|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transduction and the senses==

===The visual system===
{{Main|Visual phototransduction}}
In the [[visual system]], sensory cells called [[Rod cell|rod]] and [[cone cell]]s in the [[retina]] convert the physical energy of [[light]] signals into [[electrical impulse]]s that travel to the [[brain]]. The light causes a conformational change in a protein called [[rhodopsin]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This conformational change sets in motion a series of molecular events that result in a reduction of the electrochemical gradient of the photoreceptor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The decrease in the electrochemical gradient causes a reduction in the electrical signals going to the brain. Thus, in this example, more light hitting the photoreceptor results in the transduction of a signal into fewer electrical impulses, effectively communicating that stimulus to the brain. A change in neurotransmitter release is mediated through a second messenger system. Note that the change in neurotransmitter release is by rods. Because of the change, a change in light intensity causes the response of the rods to be much slower than expected (for a process associated with the nervous system).&lt;ref name="Silverthorn, Dee Unglaub 2004"&gt;Silverthorn, Dee Unglaub. Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach, 3rd Edition, Inc, San Francisco, CA, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The auditory system===
{{Main|Neuronal encoding of sound}}
In the [[auditory system]], sound vibrations (mechanical energy) are transduced into electrical energy by hair cells in the inner ear. Sound vibrations from an object cause vibrations in air molecules, which in turn, vibrate the [[ear drum]]. The movement of the eardrum causes the bones of the middle ear (the [[ossicles]]) to vibrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koike|first=Takuji|last2=Wada|first2=Hiroshi|last3=Kobayashi|first3=Toshimitsu|title=Modeling of the human middle ear using the finite-element method|url=https://doi.org/10.1121/1.1451073|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=111|issue=3|pages=1306–1317|doi=10.1121/1.1451073}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/123956006|title=Anatomy and physiology of hearing for audiologists|last=W.|first=Clark, William|date=2008|publisher=Thomson Delmar|others=Ohlemiller, Kevin K.|isbn=9781401814441|location=Clifton Park, NY|oclc=123956006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These vibrations then pass into the [[cochlea]], the organ of hearing. Within the cochlea, the hair cells on the sensory epithelium of the [[organ of Corti]] bend and cause movement of the basilar membrane. The membrane undulates in different sized waves according to the frequency of the sound. Hair cells are then able to convert this movement (mechanical energy) into electrical signals (graded receptor potentials) which travel along auditory nerves to hearing centres in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Eatock, R.

===The olfactory system===
{{Main|Olfactory transduction}}
In the [[olfactory system]], odorant molecules in the mucus bind to G-protein receptors on olfactory cells. The G-protein activates a downstream signalling cascade that causes increased level of cyclic-AMP (cAMP), which trigger neurotransmitter release.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Ronnett, Gabriele V., &amp; Moon, Cheil.

===The gustatory system===
{{Main|Gustatory system}}
In the [[gustatory system]], perception of five primary [[Basic tastes|taste qualities]] (sweet, salty, sour, bitter and umami [savoriness] ) depends on taste transduction pathways, through taste receptor cells, G proteins, ion channels, and effector enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy A Gilbertson; Sami Damak; Robert F Margolskee, "The molecular physiology of taste transduction", Current Opinion in Neurobiology (August 2000), 10 (4), pg. 519-527&lt;/ref&gt;

===The somatosensory system===
{{Main|Mechanotransduction}}
In the [[somatosensory system]] the sensory transduction mainly involves the conversion of the mechanical signal such as pressure, skin compression, stretch, vibration to electro-ionic impulses through the process of [[mechanotransduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TOH.2014.2369422 |title=Vibrotactile Sensitivity Threshold: Nonlinear Stochastic Mechanotransduction Model of the Pacinian Corpuscle |year=2015 |last1=Biswas |first1=Abhijit |journal=IEEE Transactions on Haptics |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=102–113 |pmid=25398183 |last2=Manivannan |first2=M. |last3=Srinivasan |first3=Mandyam A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes the sensory transduction related to [[thermoception]] and [[nociception]].

[[File:Digitales_Geländemodell.png|thumb|TIN overlaid with [[contour line]]s]]

A '''triangulated irregular network''' ('''TIN''') is a representation of a continuous surface consisting entirely of triangular facets, used mainly as [[Discrete Global Grid]] in [[digital elevation model#Types_of_DEM|primary elevation modeling]].  

The vertices of these triangles are created from field recorded spot elevations through a variety of means including surveying through conventional, Global Positioning System Real-Time Kinematic (GPS RTK), photogrammetry, or some other means.  Associated with three-dimensional data (''x'', ''y'', and ''z'') and topography, TINs are useful for the description and analysis of general horizontal (''x'' and ''y'') distributions and relationships.

Digital TIN [[data structures]] are used in a variety of applications, including [[geographic information systems]] (GIS), and computer aided drafting (CAD) for the visual representation of a topographical surface. A TIN is an [[Array data type|vector]]-based representation of the physical land surface or sea bottom, made up of irregularly distributed [[vertex (geometry)|nodes]] and lines with [[dimension|three-dimensional]] [[coordinates]] (''x'', ''y'', and ''z'') that are arranged in a network of non-overlapping triangles.

A TIN comprises a triangular network of vertices, known as mass points, with associated [[coordinates]] in three [[dimensions]] connected by edges to form a triangular [[tessellation]]. Three-dimensional visualizations are readily created by rendering of the triangular facets. In regions where there is little variation in surface height, the points may be widely spaced whereas in areas of more intense variation in height the point density is increased.

A TIN used to represent [[terrain]] is often called a [[digital elevation model]] (DEM), which can be further used to produce digital surface models (DSM) or digital terrain models (DTM).  An advantage of using a TIN over a  [[rasterized]] [[digital elevation model]] (DEM) in mapping and analysis is that the points of a TIN are distributed variably based on an [[algorithm]] that determines which points are most necessary to create an accurate representation of the terrain. Data input is therefore flexible and fewer points need to be stored than in a raster DEM, with regularly distributed points. While a TIN may be considered less suited than a raster DEM for certain kinds of GIS applications, such as analysis of a surface's [[slope]] and [[aspect (geography)|aspect]], it is often used in CAD to create contour lines. A DTM and DSM can be formed from a DEM. A DEM can be interpolated from a TIN.

TIN are based on a [[Delaunay triangulation]] or constrained Delaunay.  Delaunay conforming triangulations are recommended over constrained triangulations. This is because the resulting TINs are likely to contain fewer long, skinny triangles, which are undesirable for surface analysis. Additionally, natural neighbor interpolation and Thiessen (Voronoi) polygon generation can only be performed on Delaunay conforming triangulations.  A constrained Delaunay triangulation can be considered when you need to explicitly define certain edges that are guaranteed not to be modified (that is, split into multiple edges) by the triangulator.  Constrained Delaunay triangulations are also useful for minimizing the size of a TIN, since they have fewer nodes and triangles where breaklines are not densified.

The TIN model was developed in the early 1970s as a simple way to build a surface from a set of irregularly spaced points.  The first triangulated irregular network program for GIS was written by W. Randolph Franklin, under the direction of David Douglas and Thomas Peucker (Poiker), at [[Simon Fraser University]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research – Triangulated Irregular Network |accessdate=2007-07-26 |url=http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/wrf/pmwiki/Research/TriangulatedIrregularNetwork }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water quality''' refers to the [[Chemical property|chemical]], [[Physical property|physical]], [[Biology|biological]], and [[radiological]] characteristics of [[water]].&lt;ref name="water quality"&gt;Diersing, Nancy (2009). [http://floridakeys.noaa.gov/scisummaries/wqfaq.pdf "Water Quality: Frequently Asked Questions."] Florida Brooks National Marine Sanctuary, Key  West, FL.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a measure of the condition of water relative to the requirements of one or more biotic species and or to any human need or purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D.L., S.H. Ambrose, T.J. Bassett, M.L. Bowen, D.E. Crummey, J.S. Isaacson, D.N. Johnson, P. Lamb, M. Saul, and A.E. Winter-Nelson (1997). "Meanings of environmental terms." ''Journal of Environmental Quality.'' 26: 581–589. {{doi|10.2134/jeq1997.00472425002600030002x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most frequently used by reference to a set of standards against which compliance, generally achieved through [[Water treatment|treatment]] of the water, can be assessed. The most common standards used to assess water quality relate to health of [[ecosystems]], [[safety]] of human contact, and [[drinking water]].

== Standards ==
In the setting of standards, agencies make political and technical/scientific decisions about how the water will be used.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/standards-water-body-health |title=What are Water Quality Standards? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-03-17 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of natural [[Body of water|water bodies]], they also make some reasonable estimate of pristine conditions. Natural water bodies will vary in response to environmental conditions. [[Environmental science|Environmental scientists]] work  to understand how these systems function, which in turn helps to identify the sources and fates of [[contaminant]]s. [[Environmental lawyers]] and [[policy]]makers work to define [[legislation]] with the intention that water is maintained at an appropriate quality for its identified use.

The vast majority of [[surface water]] on the [[Earth]] is neither [[potable]] nor [[toxicity|toxic]]. This remains true when [[seawater]] in the [[ocean]]s (which is too [[Salinity|salty]] to drink) is not counted. Another general perception of water quality is that of a simple property that tells whether water is [[pollution|polluted]] or not. In fact, water quality is a complex subject, in part because water is a complex medium intrinsically tied to the [[ecology]] of the Earth. [[Industry|Industrial]] and [[Commerce|commercial]] activities (e.g. [[manufacturing]], [[mining]], [[construction]], [[transport]]) are a major cause of [[water pollution]] as are [[surface runoff|runoff]] from [[farm|agricultural]] areas, [[urban runoff]] and discharge of treated and untreated [[sewage]].

==Categories==
The parameters for water quality are determined by the intended use. Work in the area of water quality tends to be focused on water that is [[Water treatment|treated]] for human consumption, industrial use, or in the environment.

===Human consumption===
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2018}}
Contaminants that may be in untreated water include [[microorganism]]s such as [[virus]]es, [[protozoa]] and [[bacteria]]; [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] contaminants such as [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[metals]]; [[Organic compound|organic chemical]] contaminants from industrial processes and [[petroleum]] use; [[pesticides]] and [[herbicides]]; and [[radioactive]] contaminants. Water quality depends on the local [[geology]] and [[ecosystem]], as well as human uses such as sewage dispersion, industrial pollution, use of water bodies as a [[heat sink]], and overuse (which may lower the level of the water).

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) limits the amounts of certain contaminants in [[tap water]] provided by US [[public water system]]s. The [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] authorizes EPA to issue two types of standards:
* ''primary standards'' regulate substances that potentially affect human health;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. "National Primary Drinking Water Regulations." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{uscfr|40|141}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPA DW reqts"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/drinking-water-regulations |title=Drinking Water Regulations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-09-01 |website=Drinking Water Requirements for States and Public Water Systems |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''secondary standards'' prescribe aesthetic qualities, those that affect taste, odor, or appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations/secondary-drinking-water-standards-guidance-nuisance-chemicals |title=Secondary Drinking Water Standards: Guidance for Nuisance Chemicals |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-08 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations establish limits for contaminants in [[bottled water]] that must provide the same protection for public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/BuyStoreServeSafeFood/ucm046894.htm |title=FDA Regulates the Safety of Bottled Water Beverages Including Flavored Water and Nutrient-Added Water Beverages |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-09-22 |website=Food Facts for Consumers |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |location=Silver Spring, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of these contaminants does not necessarily indicate that the water poses a health risk.

In [[urbanization|urbanized]] areas around the world, [[water purification]] technology is used in municipal water systems to remove contaminants from the source water (surface water or [[groundwater]]) before it is distributed to homes, businesses, schools and other recipients. Water drawn directly from a stream, lake, or [[aquifer]] and that has no treatment will be of uncertain quality.

===Industrial and domestic use===
[[Solvation|Dissolved]] minerals may affect suitability of water for a range of industrial and domestic purposes. The most familiar of these is probably the presence of [[ion]]s of [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[magnesium]] (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) which interfere with the cleaning action of [[soap]], and can form hard [[sulfate]] and soft [[carbonate]] [[Precipitation|deposits]] in water [[heater]]s or [[boiler]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Babbitt, Harold E. &amp; Doland, James J. ''Water Supply Engineering'' (1949) '''ASIN:''' B000OORYE2; McGraw-Hill p.388&lt;/ref&gt;  Hard water may be softened to remove these ions. The softening process often substitutes [[sodium]] cations.&lt;ref&gt;Linsley, Ray K. &amp; Franzini, Joseph B. ''Water-Resources Engineering'' (1972) McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-037959-9}} pp.454–456&lt;/ref&gt;  Hard water may be preferable to soft water for human consumption, since health problems have been associated with excess sodium and with calcium and magnesium deficiencies. Softening decreases nutrition and may increase cleaning effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2004). [http://www.who.int/entity/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrconsensusrep.pdf "Consensus of the Meeting: Nutrient minerals in drinking-water and the potential health consequences of long-term consumption of demineralized and remineralized and altered mineral content drinking-waters."] ''Rolling Revision of the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality (draft).'' From November 11–13, 2003 meeting in Rome, Italy at the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Various industries' wastes and effluents can also pollute the water quality in receiving bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canencia|first=Oliva P|last2=Dalugdug|first2=Marlou D|last3=Emano|first3=Athena Marie|last4=Mendoza|first4=Richard|last5=Walag|first5=Angelo Mark P.|date=2016-08-31|title=Slaughter waste effluents and river catchment watershed contamination in Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307931158_Slaughter_waste_effluents_and_river_catchment_watershed_contamination_in_Cagayan_de_Oro_City_Philippines|journal=ResearchGate|volume=9|issue=2|issn=2220-6663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental water quality===
[[File:View of urban runoff discharging to coastal waters.jpg|right|200px|thumb|upright|[[Urban runoff]] discharging to coastal waters]]
{{See also|Environmental monitoring|Freshwater environmental quality parameters}}

'''Environmental water quality''', also called '''ambient water quality,''' relates to water bodies such as [[lake]]s, [[river]]s, and [[ocean]]s. Water quality standards for surface waters vary significantly due to different environmental conditions, ecosystems, and intended human uses. Toxic substances and high populations of certain [[microorganism]]s can present a health hazard for non-drinking purposes such as irrigation, swimming, fishing, rafting, boating, and industrial uses. These conditions may also affect wildlife, which use the water for drinking or as a habitat. Modern water quality laws generally specify protection of fisheries and recreational use and require, as a minimum, retention of current quality standards.
[[File:Monster Soup commonly called Thames Water. Wellcome V0011218.jpg|thumb|left|Satirical cartoon by [[William Heath (artist)|William Heath]], showing a woman observing monsters in a drop of London water (at the time of the ''Commission on the London Water Supply'' report, 1828)]]
There is some desire among the public to return water bodies to pristine, or pre-industrial conditions. Most current environmental laws focus on the designation of particular uses of a water body. In some countries these designations allow for some [[water contamination]] as long as the particular type of contamination is not harmful to the designated uses. Given the landscape changes (e.g., [[land development]], [[urbanization]], [[clearcutting]] in forested areas) in the [[drainage basin|watersheds]] of many freshwater bodies, returning to pristine conditions would be a significant challenge. In these cases, environmental scientists focus on achieving goals for maintaining healthy ecosystems and may concentrate on the protection of populations of [[endangered species]] and protecting human health.

==Sampling and measurement==
{{See also|water chemistry analysis|analytical chemistry|water sampling stations}}
The complexity of water quality as a subject is reflected in the many types of measurements of water quality indicators. The most accurate measurements of water quality are made on-site, because water exists in [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] with its [[Environment (systems)|surroundings]]. Measurements commonly made on-site and in direct contact with the water source in question include [[temperature]], [[pH]], [[dissolved oxygen]], [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]], [[Reduction potential|oxygen reduction potential (ORP)]], [[turbidity]], and [[Secchi disk]] depth.

===Sample collection===
{{also|Environmental monitoring#Sampling methods}}
[[File:WQ sampling station USGS 2004.jpg|thumb|An automated sampling station installed along the East Branch [[Milwaukee River]], [[New Fane, Wisconsin]]. The cover of the 24-bottle autosampler (center) is partially raised, showing the sample bottles inside. The autosampler was programmed to collect samples at time intervals, or proportionate to flow over a specified period. The data logger (white cabinet) recorded temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen levels.]]
More complex measurements are often made in a [[laboratory]] requiring a water [[Sample (material)|sample]] to be collected, preserved, transported, and analyzed at another location. The process of water sampling introduces two significant problems:
* The first problem is the extent to which the sample may be representative of the water source of interest. Many water sources vary with time and with location. The measurement of interest may vary seasonally or from day to night or in response to some activity of man or natural populations of aquatic [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Goldman, Charles R. &amp; Horne, Alexander J. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Iys5rnwkWYC Limnology]'' (1983) McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-023651-8}} chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; The measurement of interest may vary with distances from the water boundary with overlying [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] and underlying or confining [[soil]]. The sampler must determine if a single time and location meets the needs of the investigation, or if the water use of interest can be satisfactorily assessed by [[average]]d values with time and location, or if critical [[maxima and minima]] require individual measurements over a range of times, locations or events. The sample collection procedure must assure correct weighting of individual sampling times and locations where averaging is appropriate.&lt;ref name="Franson"&gt;Franson, Mary Ann (1975). ''[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000494277 Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater]'' 14th ed. Washington, DC: American Public Health Association, American Water Works Association &amp; Water Pollution Control Federation. {{ISBN|0-87553-078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39–40}} Where critical maximum or minimum values exist, [[statistics|statistical methods]] must be applied to observed variation to determine an adequate number of samples to assess [[probability]] of exceeding those critical values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=August 1973 |title=Handbook for Monitoring Industrial Wastewater |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=20008SJY.txt |publisher=EPA |chapter=Chapter 8. Data Analysis |id=EPA 625/6-73/002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second problem occurs as the sample is removed from the water source and begins to establish [[chemical equilibrium]] with its new surroundings – the sample container. Sample containers must be made of [[material]]s with minimal [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] with substances to be measured; and pre-cleaning of sample containers is important. The water sample may dissolve part of the sample container and any residue on that container, or chemicals dissolved in the water sample may [[sorption|sorb]] onto the sample container and remain there when the water is poured out for analysis.&lt;ref name="Franson" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Similar physical and chemical interactions may take place with any [[pump]]s, [[piping]], or intermediate devices used to transfer the water sample into the sample container. Water collected from depths below the surface will normally be held at the reduced [[pressure]] of the atmosphere; so gas [[solvation|dissolved]] in the water may escape into unfilled space at the top of the container. Atmospheric gas present in that air space may also dissolve into the water sample. Other [[Chemical equilibrium|chemical reaction equilibria]] may change if the water sample changes temperature. Finely divided solid particles formerly [[suspended solids|suspended]] by water [[turbulence]] may settle to the bottom of the sample container, or a solid [[Phase (matter)|phase]] may form from biological growth or [[precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]]. [[Microorganism]]s within the water sample may biochemically alter [[concentration]]s of [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[organic compound]]s. Changing carbon dioxide concentrations may alter [[pH]] and change [[solubility]] of chemicals of interest. These problems are of special concern during measurement of chemicals assumed to be significant at very low concentrations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:watersampling.JPG|thumb|right|Filtering a manually collected water sample ([[Environmental monitoring#Grab samples|grab sample]]) for analysis]]
Sample preservation may partially resolve the second problem. A common procedure is keeping samples cold to slow the [[reaction rate|rate of chemical reactions]] and phase change, and analyzing the sample as soon as possible; but this merely minimizes the changes rather than preventing them.&lt;ref name="Franson" /&gt;{{rp|43–45}} A useful procedure for determining influence of sample containers during delay between sample collection and analysis involves preparation for two artificial samples in advance of the sampling event. One sample container is filled with water known from previous analysis to contain no detectable amount of the chemical of interest. This sample, called a "blank", is opened for exposure to the atmosphere when the sample of interest is collected, then resealed and transported to the laboratory with the sample for analysis to determine if sample holding procedures introduced any measurable amount of the chemical of interest.  The second artificial sample is collected with the sample of interest, but then "spiked" with a measured additional amount of the chemical of interest at the time of collection. The blank and spiked samples are carried with the sample of interest and analyzed by the same methods at the same times to determine any changes indicating gains or losses during the elapsed time between collection and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;United States Geological Survey (USGS), Denver, CO (2009).

===Testing in response to natural disasters and other emergencies===
Inevitably after events such as [[earthquake]]s and [[tsunami]]s, there is an immediate response by the aid agencies as relief operations get underway to try and restore basic infrastructure and provide the basic fundamental items that are necessary for survival and subsequent recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/tsunamis/waterquality.html|title=Water Quality After a Tsunami|last=Natural Disasters and Severe Weather|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to clean drinking water and adequate [[sanitation]] is a priority at times like this. The threat of [[disease]] increases hugely due to the large numbers of people living close together, often in squalid conditions, and without proper sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Furusawa|first=Takuro|last2=Maki|first2=Norio|last3=Suzuki|first3=Shingo|date=2008-01-01|title=Bacterial contamination of drinking water and nutritional quality of diet in the areas of the western Solomon Islands devastated by the April 2, 2007 earthquake⁄tsunami|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tmh/36/2/36_2007-63/_article|journal=Tropical Medicine and Health|volume=36|issue=2|pages=65–74|doi=10.2149/tmh.2007-63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a [[natural disaster]], as far as water quality testing is concerned there are widespread views on the best course of action to take and a variety of methods can be employed. The key basic water quality parameters that need to be addressed in an emergency are bacteriological indicators of fecal contamination, free [[chlorine]] residual, [[pH]], [[turbidity]] and possibly [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]]/[[total dissolved solids]]. There are a number of portable water test kits on the market widely used by aid and relief agencies for carrying out such testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hanaor| first1=Dorian A.

After major natural disasters, a considerable length of time might pass before water quality returns to pre-disaster levels. For example, following the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]] the Colombo-based [[International Water Management Institute]] (IWMI) monitored the effects of saltwater and concluded that the wells recovered to pre-tsunami drinking water quality one and a half years after the event.&lt;ref&gt;International Water Management Institute, Colombo, Sri Lanka (2010). [http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%207%20-%20Helping_restore_the_quality_of_drinking_water_after_the_tsunami.pdf "Helping restore the quality of drinking water after the tsunami."] ''Success Stories.'' Issue 7. {{doi|10.5337/2011.0030}}&lt;/ref&gt; IWMI developed protocols for cleaning wells contaminated by saltwater; these were subsequently officially endorsed by the [[World Health Organization]] as part of its series of Emergency Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2011). [http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/hygiene/envsan/technotes/en/ "WHO technical notes for emergencies."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212053301/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/hygiene/envsan/technotes/en/ |date=12 February 2016 }} Water Engineering Development Centre, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical analysis===
[[File:GCMS open.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|gas chromatograph-&lt;br/&gt;mass spectrometer]] measures [[pesticide]]s and other [[Organic compound|organic]] pollutants]]
The simplest methods of [[Analytical chemistry|chemical analysis]] are those measuring [[chemical element]]s without respect to their form. Elemental analysis for [[oxygen]], as an example, would indicate a concentration of 890 g/L ([[grams]] per [[litre]]) of water sample because oxygen (O) has 89% mass of the water molecule (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). The method selected to measure [[dissolved oxygen]] should differentiate between [[Diatomic molecule|diatomic]] oxygen and oxygen combined with other elements. The comparative simplicity of elemental analysis has produced a large amount of sample data and water quality criteria for elements sometimes identified as [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]]. Water analysis for heavy metals must consider soil particles suspended in the water sample. These suspended soil particles may contain measurable amounts of metal. Although the particles are not [[solvation|dissolved]] in the water, they may be consumed by people drinking the water. Adding [[acid]] to a water sample to prevent loss of dissolved metals onto the sample container may dissolve more metals from suspended soil particles. [[Filtration]] of soil particles from the water sample before acid addition, however, may cause loss of dissolved metals onto the filter.&lt;ref&gt;State of California Environmental Protection Agency ''Representative Sampling of Ground Water for Hazardous Substances'' (1994) pp.23–24&lt;/ref&gt; The complexities of differentiating similar [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]] are even more challenging.
[[File:PSA 2.jpg|thumb|[[Atomic fluorescence spectroscopy]] is used to measure [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and other heavy metals]]
Making these complex measurements can be expensive. Because direct measurements of water quality can be expensive, ongoing monitoring programs are typically conducted by [[Government agency|government agencies]]. However, there are local volunteer programs and resources available for some general assessment.&lt;ref&gt;An example of a local government-sponsored volunteer monitoring program: {{cite web |url=https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/water/streams/monitoring.html |title=Monitoring Our Waters |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Watershed Restoration |publisher=Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection |location=Rockville, Maryland |access-date=2018-11-11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tools available to the general public include on-site test kits, commonly used for home [[Aquarium|fish tanks]], and biological assessment procedures.

===Real-time monitoring===
Although water quality is usually sampled and analyzed at laboratories, nowadays, citizens demand real-time information about the water they are drinking. During the last years, several companies are deploying worldwide real-time remote monitoring systems for measuring water pH, turbidity or dissolved oxygen levels.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Drinking water indicators===
[[File:Electrical conductivity meter.jpg|thumb|right|An [[electrical conductivity meter]] is used to measure [[total dissolved solids]]]]
The following is a list of indicators often measured by situational category:
* [[Alkalinity]]
* [[Color of water]]
* [[pH]]
* Taste and odor ([[geosmin]], [[2-Methylisoborneol]] (MIB), etc.)
* Dissolved metals and salts ([[sodium]], [[chloride]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]], [[manganese]], [[magnesium]])
* Microorganisms such as [[fecal coliform]] bacteria (''Escherichia coli''), [[Cryptosporidium]], and [[Giardia lamblia]]; ''see'' [[Bacteriological water analysis]]
* Dissolved metals and metalloids ([[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[arsenic]], etc.)
* Dissolved organics: [[colored dissolved organic matter]] (CDOM), [[dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC)
* [[Radon]]
* [[Heavy metals]]
* [[Pharmaceutical]]s
* [[Hormone]] analogs

[[Biological indicator|Biological monitoring]] metrics have been developed in many places, and one widely used measure is the presence and abundance of members of the insect orders [[Ephemeroptera]], [[Plecoptera]] and [[Trichoptera]] (common names are, respectively, mayfly, stonefly and caddisfly). EPT indexes will naturally vary from region to region, but generally, within a region, the greater the number of taxa from these orders, the better the water quality. Organisations in the United States, such as EPA. offer guidance on developing a monitoring program and identifying members of these and other aquatic insect orders. Many US wastewater dischargers (e.g., factories, power plants, [[refineries]], mines, municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants) are required to conduct periodic '''whole effluent toxicity''' (WET) tests.&lt;ref name="WET-methods"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/cwa-methods/whole-effluent-toxicity-methods |title=Whole Effluent Toxicity Methods |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-04-19 |website=Clean Water Act Analytical Methods |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=October 2002 |title=Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms |url=https://www.epa.gov/cwa-methods/acute-toxicity-wet-methods |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-821-R-02-012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals interested in monitoring water quality who cannot afford or manage lab scale analysis can also use biological indicators to get a general reading of water quality. One example is the IOWATER volunteer water monitoring program of [[Iowa]], which includes a [[benthic]] [[macroinvertebrate]] indicator key.&lt;ref&gt;IOWATER (Iowa Department of Natural Resources). Iowa City, IA (2005). [http://www.iowater.net/Publications/BMIKey2Edvmay05.pdf "Benthic Macroinvertebrate Key."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bivalve molluscs are largely used as [[bioindicators]] to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both  fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of the ecosystem. They are particularly useful since they are sessile so that they are representative of the environment where they are sampled or placed. A typical project is the U.S. [[Mussel Watch Program]]me,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccma.nos.noaa.gov/about/coast/nsandt/musselwatch.aspx |title=Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment: Mussel Watch Contaminant Monitoring |publisher=Ccma.nos.noaa.gov |date=2014-01-14 |accessdate=2015-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907012135/http://ccma.nos.noaa.gov/about/coast/nsandt/musselwatch.aspx |archivedate=7 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but today they are used worldwide.

The Southern African Scoring System (SASS) method is a biological water quality monitoring system based on the presence of benthic macroinvertebrates. The SASS [[aquatic biomonitoring]] tool has been refined over the past 30 years and is now on the fifth version (SASS5) which has been specifically modified in accordance with international standards, namely the [[ISO/IEC 17025]] protocol.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens CWS and Graham PM. 2002.

* The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has published guidelines for drinking-water quality (GDWQ) in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for drinking-water quality, fourth edition|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/2011/dwq_guidelines/en/index.html|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) published {{when|date=June 2016}} regulation of water quality in the section of ICS 13.060,&lt;ref name=13wq&gt;{{cite web  | last = International Organization for Standardization (ISO) | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = 13.060: Water quality  | location = Geneva, Switzerland  | date =  | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_ics_browse.htm?ICS1=13&amp;ICS2=060 | doi = | accessdate = 2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from water sampling, drinking water, industrial class water, sewage, and examination of water for chemical, physical or biological properties.

====European Union====
{{Further information|Water supply and sanitation in the European Union}}
The water policy of the [[European Union]] is primarily codified in three [[European Union directive|directives]]:
*[[Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment]] (91/271/EEC) of 21 May 1991 concerning discharges of municipal and some industrial [[wastewater]]s;
*[[Water supply and sanitation in the European Union#Drinking water directive of 1998|The Drinking Water Directive]] (98/83/EC) of 3 November 1998 concerning potable water quality;
*[[Water Framework Directive]] (2000/60/EC) of 23 October 2000 concerning [[water resources]] management.

====India====
* [[Indian Council of Medical Research]] (ICMR) Standards for Drinking Water.

====South Africa====
{{Further information|Water supply and sanitation in South Africa}}
Water quality guidelines for South Africa are grouped according to potential user types (e.g. domestic, industrial) in the 1996 Water Quality Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Republic of South Africa, Department of Water Affairs, Pretoria (1996). [http://www.dwaf.gov.za/IWQS/wq_guide/index.html "Water quality guidelines for South Africa: First Edition 1996."]&lt;/ref&gt;  Drinking water quality is subject to the South African National Standard (SANS) 241 Drinking Water Specification.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson K, Manus L. A drinking water quality framework for South Africa. Water SA. 2006;32(5):673–678 [http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/viewFile/47853/34223].&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In England and Wales acceptable levels for drinking water supply are listed in the "Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2000."&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, London, UK. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/3184/contents/made "The Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2000."] 2000 No. 3184. 2000-12-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
In the United States, [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|Water Quality Standards]] are defined by state agencies for various water bodies, guided by the desired uses for the water body (e.g., fish habitat, drinking water supply, recreational use).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Clean Water Act, Section 303, {{USC|33|1313}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) requires each governing jurisdiction (states, territories, and covered tribal entities) to submit a set of biennial reports on the quality of water in their area. These reports are known as the 303(d) and 305(b) reports, named for their respective CWA provisions, and are submitted to, and approved by, EPA.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Clean Water Act, Section 303(d), {{USC|33|1313}}; Section 305(b), {{USC|33|1315(b)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These reports are completed by the governing jurisdiction, typically a [[:Category:State environmental protection agencies of the United States|state environmental agency]]. EPA recommends that each state submit a single "Integrated Report" comprising its list of impaired waters and the status of all water bodies in the state.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/tmdl/program-overview-303d-listing |title=Program Overview: 303(d) Listing |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-10-24 |website=Impaired Waters and TMDLs |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''National Water Quality Inventory Report to Congress'' is a general report on water quality, providing overall information about the number of miles of streams and rivers and their aggregate condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/national-water-quality-inventory-report-congress |title=National Water Quality Inventory Report to Congress |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-08-18 |website=Water Data and Tools |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CWA requires states to adopt standards for each of the possible designated uses that they assign to their waters. Should evidence suggest or document that a stream, river or lake has failed to meet the water quality criteria for one or more of its designated uses, it is placed on a list of impaired waters. Once a state has placed a water body on this list, it must develop a management plan establishing [[Total Maximum Daily Load]]s (TMDLs) for the pollutant(s) impairing the use of the water. These TMDLs establish the reductions needed to fully support the designated uses.&lt;ref&gt;More information about water quality in the United States is available on EPA's [https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/surf-your-watershed "Surf Your Watershed"] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drinking water standards, which are applicable to [[public water system]]s, are issued by EPA under the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]].&lt;ref name="EPA DW reqts"/&gt;
