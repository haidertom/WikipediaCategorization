'''Akrodha''' ([[Sanskrit]]: अक्रोध) literally means "free from anger".&lt;ref name=apte/&gt; It is considered an important virtue in Indian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Mohapatra (1993), Hinduism: Analytical Study, South Asian Books, {{ISBN|978-81-7099-388-9}}, page 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Akrodha is a fusion word ''a'' (अ, without, non) and ''krodha'' (क्रोध, anger),&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=krodha&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 krodha] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; or 'without anger'. A related word is ''Akrodhah'' ([[Sanskrit]]: अक्रोध:), which also means 'absence of anger'.&lt;ref name=apte&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%A7&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
''Akrodha'' is considered a virtue and desirable ethical value in Hinduism. When there is cause of getting angry but even then there is absence of anger, it is non-anger or ''akrodha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Integrated Development Plan for India|author=Shanti Swarup Gupta|publisher=Concept Publishing|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UY7vr_CF_WcC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=Akrodha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgsEU67JJuSS7AaPwIG4Bw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Akrodha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absence of anger (''akrodha'') means being calm even when insulted, rebuked or despite great provocation. ''Akrodha'' does not mean absence of causes of anger, it means not getting angry and keeping an even, calm temper despite the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita|author=Dharmdeo Singh|publisher=Llumina Press|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eixNr74-MggC&amp;pg=PT69&amp;dq=Akrodha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgsEU67JJuSS7AaPwIG4Bw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Akrodha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Krodha'' ('anger') is excessive mental turmoil on account of the obstacles in the gratification of some desire; it is manifestation of the quality of [[Tamas (philosophy)|tamas]] (dark, negative, destructive), an undesirable psychological state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shrimad Bhagavad Gita|author=Pushpa Anand|publisher=Arpana publications|pages=874–875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rl8pAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Akrodha&amp;dq=Akrodha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgsEU67JJuSS7AaPwIG4Bw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of ''Krodha'' is ''Akrodha'', and this is a productive, positive and constructive state.

Bhawuk states that ''akrodha'' is necessary to any process of peace. Peace and happiness is a state of contentment (santustah), where there is absence of spite or envy (advestah), absence of anger (akrodhah), and absence of violence ([[ahimsa]]).&lt;ref&gt;DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology, Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, page 138&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dharma]]'' relies on ''Akrodha'', because it creates an environment of serenity, a rational principle of life, and because it is a moral virtue inspired by love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism: Analytical Study|author=Amulya Mohapatra|publisher=Mittal Publications|pages=40–41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpiU9m7T_tQC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=Akrodha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgsEU67JJuSS7AaPwIG4Bw&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Akrodha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
According to [[Vedic]] sages, when work becomes akin to a ''[[yajna]]'' (a worship ceremony), the effect of that work is transformed into ''[[apurva]]'', that is, it becomes something unique, unprecedented and empowering. In contrast, anger clouds reason, which results in the loss of discrimination between right and wrong and virtue and vice. When the discriminating faculty is ruined, the person loses self-identity and the inner good perishes. With freedom from anger, a person reaches an ''apurva'' state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hindu Mind|author=Bansi Pandit|publisher=New Age Books|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XA9zEw93KXEC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=Akrodha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0Q0EU5LQEsiN7QbkmoGoBQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Akrodha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Upanishads===
Narada Parivrajaka Upanishad states the nature of ''akrodha'' for a person who seeks self-knowledge and liberation ([[moksha|kaivalya]]) as follows,

{{quote|All cruel words should be endured. None should be treated with disrespect. No anger should be directed in turn towards one who is angry. Only soft words should be spoken, even when violently pulled by another.|[[Narada Parivrajaka Upanishad]], Atharva Veda|&lt;ref&gt;KN Aiyar (Translator), Thirty Minor Upanishads, Madras (1914), page 138–140, {{oclc|23013613}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Akrodha'', states Manickam,&lt;ref name=lssm&gt;L. Sam S. Manickam, [http://www.indigenouspsych.org/Interest%20Group/Manickam/Y-5f-Sam.pdf Sahya: The Concept in Indian Philosophical Psychology and Its Contemporary Relevance], in Yoga and Indian Approaches to Psychology, (Editors: Joshi, Cornelissen et al.) Centre for the Study of Civilizations, pages 426–435, {{oclc|466687885}}&lt;/ref&gt; is related to the concept ''Sahya'' (Sanskrit: सह्य) in the Upanishads. ''Sahya'' means, depending on the context, to bear, endure, suffer, and put up with.&lt;ref name=lssm/&gt; The quality to ''Sahya'' is considered an ethical value in Hinduism, not out of weakness to react, but for the cause of the ultimate "Truth". It is the attribute by which a person willingly bears negative cognitive inputs in order to "win over" the opponent or whatever is offensive, in the pursuit of holding on to Truth, in order to achieve oneness with Brahman, the ultimate Truth. This endurance, this strive to overcome the adversaries, through ''akrodha'' and ''[[ahimsa]]'', is recommended as the constructive way in one's pursuit of "Truth".&lt;ref name=lssm/&gt;

===The Epics===
The Hindu epic Mahabharata repeatedly emphasizes the virtue of ''akrodha''. For example, in [[Adi Parva]], it states&lt;ref name=mndap/&gt;

{{quote|If wronged, you should not wrong in return. One's anger, if not subdued, burns one's own self; if subdued, it procures the virtues of the doers of good acts. You should never give pain to others by cruel words. Never defeat your enemies by despicable means. Never utter sinful and burning words as may give pain to others.|The [[Mahabharata]], Adi Parva, Chapter LXXXVII, verses 7–8|&lt;ref name=mndap&gt;MN Dutt (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/aproseenglishtr00duttgoog#page/n139/mode/2up Adi Parva], Chapter LXXXVII, Page 129&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Vana Parva]], the Mahabharata states&lt;ref name=mndap2/&gt;

{{quote|Anger is in this world, the root of the destruction of mankind. The angry man commits a sin; the angry man murders his preceptor; the angry man insults with harsh words. The angry man cannot distinguish what should be and should not be said by him; there is nothing which cannot be said or done by an angry man. From anger, a man may kill one who should not be killed and adore one that should be slain; an angry man may even despatch his own self to the abode of [[Yama]]. Beholding these evils, anger must be conquered.|The [[Mahabharata]], Vana Parva, Chapter XXIX, verses 3–7|&lt;ref name=mndap2&gt;MN Dutt (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/aproseenglishtr00duttgoog#page/n487/mode/2up Vana Parva], Chapter LXXXVII, Page 129&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Shanti Parva]], the Mahabharata states&lt;ref name=mndap3/&gt;

{{quote|That [[Yogin]] who is freed from attachment and pride, who transcends all pairs of opposites such as pleasure and pain, who never gives way to '''wrath''' or hate, who never speaks an untruth, who though slandered or struck still shows friendship for the slanderer or the striker, who never thinks of doing ill to others, who restrains these three, viz. speech, acts and mind, and who behaves uniformly towards all creatures, succeeds in approaching [[Brahman]] (true self).|The [[Mahabharata]], Shanti Parva, Chapter CCXXXVI|&lt;ref name=mndap3&gt;MN Dutt (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri07royp#page/260/mode/2up Shanti Parva], Chapter CCXXXVI, Page 260&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] (Slokas XVI.1–3), in the Mahabharata, gives a list of twenty-six divine attributes beginning with ''abhayam'' ('fearlessness') and ''sattva sansuddhih'' ('purity of mind'), ending with ''adroha'' ('bearing enmity to none') and ''naatimaanita'' ('absence of arrogance'):&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=nAtimAnin&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes नातिमानिन्] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

''Akrodha'' is one of the twenty six divine attributes a person can have, states Bhagavad Gita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadgita Tattvavivecani|author=Jayadayal Goyandaka|publisher=Gita Press, Gorakhpur|pages=621–623|quote=Quote: Non-violence in thought, word and deed, truthfulness and geniality of speech, '''absence of anger even on provocation''', disclaiming doership in respect of actions, quietude or composure of mind, abstaining from malicious gossip compassion towards all creatures, absence of attachment to the objects of senses even during their contact with the senses, mildness, a sense of shame in transgressing against the scriptures or usage, and abstaining from frivolous pursuits; (XVI.2)|url= https://www.amazon.ca/Srimadbhagavadgita-Tattvavivecani-With-English-Commentary/dp/B003FCYKVU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharmasastra===
[[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] has listed ''Akrodha'' ('absence of anger') among the ten primary virtues. The ''Apastambhadharmasutra'' (I.iii.22) rules that a student be not given to anger,  and that a house-holder is required to abstain from anger and abstain from action or words that would provoke someone else to anger (II.xviii.2). The ''Baudhayanadharmasutra'' (I.xv.30) requires a house-holder never to be angry, and the ''Gautamdharmasutra'' (II.13) advises that he must not feel angry. The ''Vashisthadharmasutra'' (IV.4) avers that refraining from anger is a virtue like truthfulness, charity among others.&lt;ref name=rp&gt;{{cite book|title=A Conceptual-analytic Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals|author=Rajendra Prasad|publisher=Concept Publishing|page=319|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D5Hk8EkmQBcC&amp;pg=PA319&amp;dq=Akrodha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgsEU67JJuSS7AaPwIG4Bw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Akrodha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manu mentions ten ''Dharma Lakshanas'', ''akrodha'' is one of these ''[[lakshana]]'' (attribute, sign of a dharmic person). The other nine are: Dhriti (patience), Kshama (forgiveness), Damah (temperance), Asteya (non-stealing), Shaucham (purity), Indriyaigraha (freedom from sensual craving), Dhi (reason), Vidya (knowledge), and Satyam (truth).&lt;ref&gt;Karanam Nagaraja Rao and Krishna Kishore, Electronic Journal of Business Ethics and Organization Studies, Vol. 19, No. 2 (2014), pages 4–8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shaivism===
The [[Shaivite]] doctrine considers four ''[[yamas]]'' for the ''[[Pashupata Shaivism|Pashupata]]'' ascetic who smears on his body ''bhasam''; the four ''yamas'' are – non-injury, celibacy, truthfulness and non-stealing; the ''[[niyama]]s'' consist of non-irritability (''akrodha''), attendance on the teachers, purity, lightness of diet and carefulness (''[[apramada]]''). ''Akrodha'' is a virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Philosophy Vol.5|author=Surendranath Dasgupta |publisher= Motilal Banarsidass |page=134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aohGsuUuXuMC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=Akrodha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgsEU67JJuSS7AaPwIG4Bw&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Akrodha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universalism==
[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] both suggest ten freedoms needed for good life.&lt;ref name=ms/&gt; These are – ''[[Ahimsa]]'' ('freedom from violence'), ''[[Asteya]]'' ('freedom from want, stealing'), ''[[Aparigraha]]'' ('freedom from exploitation'), ''Amritava'' ('freedom from early death') and ''Arogya'' ('freedom from disease'), ''Akrodha'' ('freedom of anger'), ''[[Jnana]]'' or ''Vidya'' ("freedom from ignorance"), ''Pravrtti'' ("freedom of conscience"), ''Abhaya'' ('freedom from fear') and ''[[Dhrti]]'' ('freedom from frustration and despair').&lt;ref name=ms&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Human Rights|author=[[Micheline Ishay]]|publisher=University of California Press|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTh22XQrtlQC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Akrodha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5gwEU8eGHMG47AbmzoH4Cw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Akrodha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anava''' (from "anu", meaning an atom or an exceedingly small entity) is a state - the consciousness of the ego, the sense of "I" and "mine". This represents a sense of individuality and a separation from a general existence of any "divine plan". One of the three [[Buddhist]] [[Malas (Buddhism)|malas]] or bondages: anava, [[karma]] and [[Maya (illusion)|maya]]. The three [[Malas (Buddhism)|malas]] or pashas are also explicitly discussed in the theology of [[Shaivite]] [[Hinduism]]. In [[Shaivism]], '''anava''' is the cause of the individual soul's mistaken sense of separate identity from Universal God [[Shiva|Siva]], and the last bond broken before union or Self-Realization ([[moksha]]).

'''Biodegradation''' is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as [[bacteria]], [[fungi]].{{efn| The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] defines biodegradation as "degradation caused by enzymatic process resulting from the action of cells" and notes that the definition is "modified to exclude abiotic enzymatic processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vert M, Doi Y, Hellwich KH, Hess M, Hodge P, Kubisa P, Rinaudo M, Schué F | title=Terminology for biorelated polymers and applications (IUPAC Recommendations 2012) |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |year=2012 |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=377–410 |doi=10.1351/PAC-REC-10-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Biodegradation| vauthors = Focht DD | work = AccessScience |doi=10.1036/1097-8542.422025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
The process of biodegradation can be divided into three stages: biodeterioration, biofragmentation, and assimilation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Biodeterioration is a surface-level degradation that modifies the mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of the material. This stage occurs when the material is exposed to abiotic factors in the outdoor environment and allows for further degradation by weakening the material's structure. Some abiotic factors that influence these initial changes are compression (mechanical), light, temperature, and chemicals in the environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lucas N, Bienaime C, Belloy C, Queneudec M, Silvestre F, Nava-Saucedo JE | title = Polymer biodegradation: mechanisms and estimation techniques | journal = Chemosphere | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 429–42 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18723204 | doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.06.064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;While biodeterioration typically occurs as the first stage of biodegradation, it can in some cases be parallel to biofragmentation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Muller|first=Rolf-Joachim | editor-first =  Alexander | editor-last = Steinbüchel | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Biodegradability of Polymers: Regulations and Methods for Testing |title=Biopolymers |publisher=Wiley-VCH |isbn=978-3-527-30290-1 | chapter-url = https://application.wiley-vch.de/books/biopoly/pdf_v10/vol10_19.pdf | doi = 10.1002/3527600035.bpola012 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofragmentation of a polymer is the lytic process in which bonds within a polymer are cleaved, generating oligomers and monomers in its place.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The steps taken to fragment these materials also differ based on the presence of oxygen in the system. The breakdown of materials by microorganisms when oxygen is present is aerobic digestion, and the breakdown of materials when is oxygen is not present is anaerobic digestion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polimernet.com/Docs/Aerobic%20-%20Anaerobic%20Biodegredation%20en.pdf|title=Aerobic and Anaerobic Biodegradation| work = Fundementals of Aerobic &amp; Anaerobic Biodegradation Process | publisher = Polimernet Plastik San.

The resulting products from biofragmentation are then integrated into microbial cells, this is the assimilation stage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some of the products from fragmentation are easily transported within the cell by membrane carriers. However, others still have to undergo biotransformation reactions to yield products that can then be transported inside the cell. Once inside the cell, the products enter catabolic pathways that either lead to the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or elements of the cells structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Factors affecting biodegradation rate ==
In practice, almost all chemical compounds and materials are subject to biodegradation processes. The significance, however, is in the relative rates of such processes, such as days, weeks, years or centuries. A number of factors determine the rate at which this degradation of organic compounds occurs. Factors include [[light]], [[water]], [[oxygen]] and temperature.&lt;ref name="pmid29972726"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haider T, Völker C, Kramm J, Landfester K, Wurm FR | title = Plastics of the future? The impact of biodegradable polymers on the environment and on society | journal = Angewandte Chemie (International Ed. In English) | volume = | issue = | pages = | date = July 2018 | pmid = 29972726 | doi = 10.1002/anie.201805766 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The degradation rate of many organic compounds is limited by their bioavailability, which is the rate at which a substance is absorbed into a system or made available at the site of physiological activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bioavailability|title=Definition of BIOAVAILABILITY|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as compounds must be released into solution before organisms can degrade them.The rate of biodegradation can be measured in a number of ways. [[Respirometry]] tests can be used for [[aerobic microbes]]. First one places a solid waste sample in a container with microorganisms and soil, and then aerates the mixture. Over the course of several days, microorganisms digest the sample bit by bit and produce carbon dioxide – the resulting amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; serves as an indicator of degradation. Biodegradability can also be measured by anaerobic microbes and the amount of methane or alloy that they are able to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Andy | last = Jessop | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://commercialwaste.trade/how-is-biodegradability-measured/ |title=How is biodegradability measured? |date=2015-09-16 |work=Commercial Waste |access-date=2018-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It’s important to note factors that effect biodegradation rates during product testing to ensure that the results produced are accurate and reliable. Several materials will test as being biodegradable under optimal conditions in a lab for approval but these results may not reflect real world outcomes where factors are more variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Research of the biodegradability of degradable/biodegradable plastic material in various types of environments| vauthors = Adamcova D, Radziemska M, Fronczyk J, Zloch J, Vaverkova MD | journal =  Przegląd Naukowy.

{{Main|Biodegradable plastic#Examples of biodegradable plastics}}

The term Biodegradable Plastics refers to a material that maintains its mechanical strength during practical use but break down into low-weight compounds and non-toxic byproducts after their use.&lt;ref name = "Ikada_2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ikada |first=Yoshito |last2=Tsuji |first2=Hideto | name-list-format = vanc |date= February 2000 | title = Biodegradable polyesters for medical and ecological applications |journal=Macromolecular Rapid Communications |volume=21|issue=3|pages=117–132 |doi=10.1002/(sici)1521-3927(20000201)21:3&lt;117::aid-marc117&gt;3.0.co;2-x  | url = http://web.mit.edu/course/10/10.569/www/ikadaPEreview.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This breakdown is made possible through an attack of microorganisms on the material, which is typically a non-water soluble polymer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such materials can be obtained through chemical synthesis, fermentation by microorganisms, and from chemically modified natural products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flieger M, Kantorová M, Prell A, Rezanka T, Votruba J | title = Biodegradable plastics from renewable sources | journal = Folia Microbiologica | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–44 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12744074 | doi = 10.1007/bf02931273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plastics]] biodegrade at highly variable rates.  [[Polyvinylchloride|PVC]]-based plumbing is selected for handling [[sewage]] because PVC resists biodegradation.  Some packaging materials on the other hand are being developed that would degrade readily upon exposure to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kyrikou |first=Ioanna |last2=Briassoulis |first2=Demetres | name-list-format = vanc |date=12 Apr 2007 |title=Biodegradation of Agricultural Plastic Films: A Critical Review  |journal=Journal of Polymers and the Environment |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=125–150 |doi= 10.1007/s10924-007-0053-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of [[synthetic polymer]]s that biodegrade quickly include [[polycaprolactone]], other [[polyesters]] and aromatic-aliphatic esters, due to their ester bonds being susceptible to attack by water. A prominent example is [[poly-3-hydroxybutyrate]], the renewably derived [[polylactic acid]], and the synthetic polycaprolactone. Others are the cellulose-based cellulose acetate and celluloid (cellulose nitrate).

:[[File:Polylactid sceletal.svg|thumb|150px|[[Polylactic acid]] is an example of a plastic that biodegrades quickly.]]
Under [[anaerobic decomposition|low oxygen]] conditions plastics break down more slowly. The breakdown process can be accelerated in specially designed [[compost heap]]. Starch-based plastics will degrade within two to four months in a home compost bin, while polylactic acid is largely undecomposed, requiring higher temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pls/portallive/docs/1/33773706.PDF |title= Section 6: Biodegradability of Packaging Waste |publisher=Www3.imperial.ac.uk |date= |access-date=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polycaprolactone and polycaprolactone-starch composites decompose slower, but the starch content accelerates decomposition by leaving behind a porous, high surface area polycaprolactone. Nevertheless, it takes many months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wu |first1=Chin-San | name-list-format = vanc |title=Physical properties and biodegradability of maleated-polycaprolactone/starch composite |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |date=January 2003 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=127–134 |doi=10.1016/S0141-3910(02)00393-2 | url = http://www.kyu.edu.tw/93/epaperv6/93-129.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.453.4220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, a bacterium named ''[[Ideonella sakaiensis]]'' was found to biodegrade [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]].

Many [[plastic producer]]s have gone so far even to say that their plastics are compostable, typically listing [[corn starch]] as an ingredient. However, these claims are questionable because the [[plastics industry]] operates under its own definition of compostable:
:"that which is capable of undergoing biological decomposition in a compost site such that the material is not visually distinguishable and breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with known compostable materials." (Ref: [[ASTM]] D 6002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compostable.info/compostable.htm | title = Compostable |publisher=Compostable.info |date= |access-date=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "composting" is often used informally to describe the biodegradation of packaging materials. Legal definitions exist for compostability, the process that leads to compost.  Four criteria are offered by the European Union:&lt;ref name="EN 13432"&gt;{{cite web|title=Requirements of the EN 13432 standard |url= https://docs.european-bioplastics.org/publications/bp/EUBP_BP_En_13432.pdf | date = April 2015| work =  European Bioplastics  |access-date=July 22, 2017|location=Brussels, Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Breulmann M, Künkel A, Philipp S, Reimer V, Siegenthaler KO, Skupin G, Yamamoto M | chapter = Polymers, Biodegradable | title = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | year = 2012 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | doi = 10.1002/14356007.n21_n01 | isbn = 978-3527306732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Chemical composition''': volatile matter and heavy metals as well as fluorine should be limited.
#'''Biodegradability''': the conversion of &gt;90% of the original material into CO2, water and minerals by biological processes within 6 months.
#'''Disintegrability''': at least 90% of the original mass should be decomposed into particles that are able to pass through a 2x2 mm sieve.
#'''Quality''': absence of toxic substances and other substances that impede composting.

== Biodegradable technology ==
Now biodegradable technology has become a highly developed market with applications in product [[packaging]], production, and medicine.  The biodegradation of biomass offers some guidances.&lt;ref name="pmid1736301"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luzier WD | title = Materials derived from biomass/biodegradable materials | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 839–42 | date = February 1992 | pmid = 1736301 | pmc = 48337 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyesters are known to biodegrade.&lt;ref name="pmid12161646"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gross RA, Kalra B | title = Biodegradable polymers for the environment | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = 5582 | pages = 803–7 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12161646 | doi = 10.1126/science.297.5582.803  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxo-biodegradation is defined by [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] (the European Standards Organisation) as "degradation resulting from [[oxidative]] and cell-mediated phenomena, either simultaneously or successively." Whilst sometimes described as "oxo-fragmentable," and "oxo-degradable" these terms describe only the first or oxidative phase and should not be used for material which degrades by the process of oxo-biodegradation defined by CEN: the correct description is "oxo-biodegradable."

By combining plastic products with very large polymer molecules, which contain only [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]], with [[oxygen]] in the air, the product is rendered capable of [[decomposing]] in anywhere from a week to one to two years. This reaction occurs even without prodegradant additives but at a very slow rate. That is why conventional plastics, when discarded, [[plastic waste|persist for a long time in the environment]]. Oxo-biodegradable formulations catalyze and accelerate the biodegradation process but it takes considerable skill and experience to balance the ingredients within the formulations so as to provide the product with a useful life for a set period, followed by degradation and biodegradation.&lt;ref name="pmid15864950"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agamuthu P, Faizura PN | title = Biodegradability of degradable plastic waste | journal = Waste Management &amp; Research : The Journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–100 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15864950 | doi = 10.1177/0734242X05051045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodegradable technology is especially utilized by the [[bio-medical]] community. Biodegradable polymers are classified into three groups:
medical, ecological, and dual application, while in terms of origin they are divided into two groups: natural and synthetic.&lt;ref name = "Ikada_2000" /&gt; The Clean Technology Group is exploiting the use of [[supercritical carbon dioxide]], which under high pressure at room temperature is a solvent that can use biodegradable plastics to make polymer drug coatings. The polymer (meaning a material composed of molecules with repeating structural units that form a long chain) is used to encapsulate a drug prior to injection in the body and is based on [[lactic acid]], a compound normally produced in the body, and is thus able to be excreted naturally. The coating is designed for controlled release over a period of time, reducing the number of injections required and maximizing the therapeutic benefit.  Professor Steve Howdle states that biodegradable polymers are particularly attractive for use in [[drug delivery]], as once introduced into the body they require no retrieval or further manipulation and are degraded into soluble, non-toxic by-products. Different polymers degrade at different rates within the body and therefore polymer selection can be tailored to achieve desired release rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Using Green Chemistry to Deliver Cutting Edge Drugs | author = The University of Nottingham | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070913132945.htm | work = Science Daily | date = September 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other biomedical applications include the use of biodegradable, elastic shape-memory polymers. Biodegradable implant materials can now be used for minimally invasive surgical procedures through degradable thermoplastic polymers. These polymers are now able to change their shape with increase of temperature, causing shape memory capabilities as well as easily degradable sutures. As a result, implants can now fit through small incisions, doctors can easily perform complex deformations, and sutures and other material aides can naturally biodegrade after a completed surgery.&lt;ref name="pmid11976407"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lendlein A, Langer R | title = Biodegradable, elastic shape-memory polymers for potential biomedical applications | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5573 | pages = 1673–6 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11976407 | doi = 10.1126/science.1066102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodegradation vs. composting ==
There is no universal definition for biodegradation and there are various definitions of composting, which has led to much confusion between the terms. They are often lumped together; however, they do not have the same meaning. Biodegradation is the naturally-occurring breakdown of materials by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi or other biological activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gómez |first1=Eddie F. |last2=Michel |first2=Frederick C. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Biodegradability of conventional and bio-based plastics and natural fiber composites during composting, anaerobic digestion and long-term soil incubation |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |date=December 2013 |volume=98 |issue=12 |pages=2583–2591 |doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2013.09.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composting is a human-driven process in which biodegradation occurs under a specific set of circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bpiworld.org/Composting|title=Biodegradable Products Institute - Composting|website=bpiworld.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant difference between the two is that one process is naturally-occurring and one is human-driven.

Biodegradable material is capable of decomposing without an oxygen source (anaerobically) into carbon dioxide, water, and biomass, but the timeline is not very specifically defined. Similarly, compostable material breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, and biomass; however, compostable material also breaks down into inorganic compounds. The process for composting is more specifically defined, as it controlled by humans. Essentially, composting is an accelerated biodegradation process due to optimized circumstances.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Magdoff|first=Fred | name-list-format = vanc |date= November 1993 |title=Building Soils for Better Crops |journal=Soil Science |volume=156 |issue=5 |pages=371 |doi=10.1097/00010694-199311000-00014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the end product of composting not only returns to its previous state, but also generates and adds beneficial microorganisms to the soil called humus. This organic matter can be used in gardens and on farms to help grow healthier plants in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.accessscience.com/content/325510|title=Humus|last=Morris|first=Schnitzer|last2= Martin |first2 = James P. | name-list-format = vanc | work =AccessScience |doi=10.1036/1097-8542.325510|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composting more consistently occurs within a shorter time frame since it is a more defined process and is expedited by human intervention. Biodegradation can occur in different time frames under different circumstances, but is meant to occur naturally without human intervention.
[[File:Organic Waste Disposal Streams.pdf|thumb|This figure represents the different paths of disposal for organic waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Kranert M, Behnsen A, Schultheis A, Steinbach D | chapter =Composting in the Framework of the EU Landfill Directive |date=2002 | title = Microbiology of Composting |pages=473–486 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-08724-4_39 |isbn=9783642087059 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Even within composting, there are different circumstances under which this can occur. The two main types of composting are at-home versus commercial. Both produce healthy soil to be reused - the main difference lies in what materials are able to go into the process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At-home composting is mostly used for food scraps and excess garden materials, such as weeds. Commercial composting is capable of breaking down more complex plant-based products, such as corn-based plastics and larger pieces of material, like tree branches. Commercial composting begins with a manual breakdown of the materials using a grinder or other machine to initiate the process. Because at-home composting usually occurs on a smaller scale and does not involve large machinery, these materials would not fully decompose in at-home composting. Furthermore, one study has compared and contrasted home and industrial composting, concluding that there are advantages and disadvantages to both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martínez-Blanco J, Colón J, Gabarrell X, Font X, Sánchez A, Artola A, Rieradevall J | title = The use of life cycle assessment for the comparison of biowaste composting at home and full scale | journal = Waste Management | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 983–94 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20211555 | doi = 10.1016/j.wasman.2010.02.023 | url = http://ddd.uab.cat/record/163720 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following studies provide examples in which composting has been defined as a subset of biodegradation in a scientific context. The first study, "Assessment of Biodegradability of Plastics Under Simulated Composting Conditions in a Laboratory Test Setting," clearly examines composting as a set of circumstances that falls under the category of degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Starnecker A, Menner M  |date=1996-01-01|title=Assessment of biodegradability of plastics under simulated composting conditions in a laboratory test system |journal=International Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation|language=en|volume=37|issue=1–2|pages=85–92|doi=10.1016/0964-8305(95)00089-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, this next study looked at the biodegradation and composting effects of chemically and physically crosslinked polylactic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-02-01|title=Some composting and biodegradation effects of physically or chemically crosslinked poly(lactic acid) |journal=Polymer Testing |volume=31|issue=1|pages=83–92|doi=10.1016/j.polymertesting.2011.09.012 |last1=Żenkiewicz |first1=Marian |last2=Malinowski |first2=Rafał |last3=Rytlewski |first3=Piotr |last4=Richert |first4=Agnieszka |last5=Sikorska |first5=Wanda |last6=Krasowska |first6=Katarzyna | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably discussing composting and biodegrading as two distinct terms. The third and final study reviews European standardization of biodegradable and compostable material in the packaging industry, again using the terms separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Avella M, Bonadies E, Martuscelli E, Rimedio R |date=2001-01-01|title=European current standardization for plastic packaging recoverable through composting and biodegradation |journal=Polymer Testing|language=en|volume=20|issue=5|pages=517–521|doi=10.1016/S0142-9418(00)00068-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between these terms is crucial because waste management confusion leads to improper disposal of materials by people on a daily basis. Biodegradation technology has led to massive improvements in how we dispose of waste; there now exist trash, recycling, and compost bins in order to optimize the disposal process. However, if these waste streams are commonly and frequently confused, then the disposal process is not at all optimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Akullian A, Karp C, Austin K, Durbin D | title =  Plastic Bag Externalities and Policy in Rhode Island | url = http://seattlebagtax.org/referencedpdfs/en-akullianetal.pdf | journal = Brown Policy Review | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodegradable and compostable materials have been developed to ensure more of human waste is able to breakdown and return to its previous state, or in the case of composting even add nutrients to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Song JH, Murphy RJ, Narayan R, Davies GB | title = Biodegradable and compostable alternatives to conventional plastics | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 364 | issue = 1526 | pages = 2127–39 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19528060 | pmc = 2873018 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a compostable product is thrown out as opposed to composted and sent to a landfill, these inventions and efforts are wasted. Therefore, it is important for average citizens to understand the difference between these terms so that materials can be disposed of properly and efficiently.

== Environmental and social effects ==
Plastic pollution from illegal dumping poses health risks to wildlife. Animals often mistake plastics for food, resulting in intestinal entanglement. Slow-degrading chemicals, like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), nonylphenol (NP), and pesticides also found in plastics, can release into environments and subsequently also be ingested by wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Webb |first=Hayden |last2=Arnott |first2=Jaimys |last3=Crawford |first3=Russell |last4=Ivanova |first4=Elena |last5=Webb |first5=Hayden K. |last6=Arnott |first6=Jaimys |last7=Crawford |first7=Russell J. |last8=Ivanova|first8=Elena P. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2012-12-28|title=Plastic Degradation and Its Environmental Implications with Special Reference to Poly(ethylene terephthalate) |journal=Polymers |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.3390/polym5010001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachel Carson, a notable environmentalist in the 1960s, provided one of the first key studies on the consequences associated with chemical ingestion in wildlife, specifically birds. In her work ''Silent Spring'', she wrote on [[DDT]], a pesticide commonly used in human agricultural activities. Birds that ate the tainted bugs, Carson found, were more likely to produce eggs with thin and weak shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosner D, Markowitz G | title = Persistent pollutants: a brief history of the discovery of the widespread toxicity of chlorinated hydrocarbons | journal = Environmental Research | volume = 120 | pages = 126–33 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 22999707 | doi = 10.1016/j.envres.2012.08.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In efforts to remediate the damages done by slow-degrading plastics, detergents, metals, and other pollutants created by humans, economic costs have become a concern. Marine litter in particular is notably difficult to quanitfy and review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Stephanie |last2=Watkins |first2=Emma |last3=Farmer |first3=Andrew |last4=Brink |first4=Patrick ten |last5=Schweitzer |first5=Jean-Pierre | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = The Economics of Marine Litter|date=2015 | title =Marine Anthropogenic Litter |pages=367–394 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_14 |isbn=978-3-319-16509-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the World Trade Institute estimate that cleanup initiatives' cost (specifically in ocean ecosystems) has hit close to thirteen billion dollars a year.&lt;ref name= "Matsangou_2018"&gt;{{cite news | first = Elizabeth | last = Matsangou | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2 July 2018 | url= https://www.worldfinance.com/markets/counting-the-cost-of-plastic-pollution | title=Counting the cost of plastic pollution |access-date=17 September 2018 | work = World Finance }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main concern stems from marine environments, with the biggest cleanup efforts centering around garbage patches in the ocean. In 2017, a [[Great Pacific garbage patch|garbage patch the size of Mexico]] was found in the Pacific Ocean. It is estimated to be upwards of a million square miles in size. While the patch contains more obvious examples of litter (plastic bottles, cans, and bags), tiny microplastics are nearly impossible to clean up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rochman CM, Cook AM, Koelmans AA | title = Plastic debris and policy: Using current scientific understanding to invoke positive change | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | volume = 35 | issue = 7 | pages = 1617–26 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27331654 | doi = 10.1002/etc.3408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''National Geographic'' reports that even more non-biodegradable materials are finding their way into vulnerable environments - nearly thirty-eight million pieces a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Shaena | last = Montanari | name-list-format = vanc |url= https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/07/ocean-plastic-patch-south-pacific-spd/ |title=Plastic Garbage Patch Bigger Than Mexico Found in Pacific |date=2017-07-25 |access-date=2018-09-17 | work = National Geographic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials that have not degraded can also serve as shelter for invasive species, such as tube worms and barnacles. When the ecosystem changes in response to the invasive species, resident species and the natural balance of resources, genetic diversity, and species richness is altered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gregory MR | title = Environmental implications of plastic debris in marine settings--entanglement, ingestion, smothering, hangers-on, hitch-hiking and alien invasions | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The World Trade Institute also notes that the communities who often feel most of the effects of poor biodegradation are poorer countries without the means to pay for their cleanup.&lt;ref name= "Matsangou_2018" /&gt; In a positive feedback loop effect, they in turn have trouble controlling their own pollution sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hajat A, Hsia C, O'Neill MS | title = Socioeconomic Disparities and Air Pollution Exposure: a Global Review | journal = Current Environmental Health Reports | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 440–50 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26381684 | pmc = 4626327 | doi = 10.1007/s40572-015-0069-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology of "biodegradable" ==
The first known use of ''biodegradable'' in a biological context was in 1959 when it was  employed to describe the breakdown of material into innocuous components by [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/biodegradable|title=Definition of BIODEGRADABLE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now ''biodegradable'' is commonly associated with environmentally friendly products that are part of the earth's innate cycles and capable of decomposing back into natural elements.

'''Change''' refers to a difference in a state of affairs at different points in [[time]]. Although it is a familiar experience, an analysis of change provides subtle problems which have occupied [[philosopher]]s since the [[Presocratics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Change and Inconsistency|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/change/#intro|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heraclitus]] is the first philosopher known to have directly raised such issues, with [[aphorism]]s such as "one cannot step into the same river twice". The [[Eleatics]] were particularly concerned with change and raised a number of problems, including [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno's]] [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]], which caused them to go as far as insisting that change was impossible, and that reality was one and unchanging. Later philosophers would reject this conclusion, instead developing systems such as [[atomism]] in attempts to circumvent the Eleatic problems. In the [[modernity|modern era]], some of these problems would enter the domain of [[mathematics]], with the development of [[calculus]] and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. These developments were regarded by some as solving problems of change, but others maintain that philosophical issues persist.

==In Chinese philosophy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
The Chinese philosophy of change was described in centuries of commentary on the ''[[I Ching]]'', the Book of Changes.

== In Greek philosophy ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
[[Heraclitus]] is the first philosopher for whom there exists an extant written account of an enquiry into change. Writing in an [[aphorism|aphoristic]] and esoteric style, Heraclitus remarked that, "On those stepping into rivers staying the same other and other waters flow". Or, more popularly: "One cannot step into the same river twice." This is generally taken to refer to the seeming contradiction between our calling a river "the same", while knowing that the material constituents of a river, the "waters", have completely changed. (A later follower amended the final word in the saying from "twice" to "once".)

It is unclear what reaction Heraclitus intends to induce by this statement, and he provides no exposition. It is however but one of many examples of a more general theme which Heraclitus termed the "unity of opposites" - the fact that opposing [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s could be asserted of the same thing, another example being, "the road up and the road down is one and the same".

=== The Eleatics ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
Change was one of the chief concerns of the [[Eleatic]] school of thought founded by [[Parmenides]]. Parmenides considered non-existence to be absurd, and thus asserted that it was impossible for something to come into existence out of nothing, or for something to pass out of existence into nothing. By "something", he was referring not just to material, but to any general predicate; rejecting, for instance, changes of colour, as they involved the new colour arising from nothing and the old colour passing into nothing. He therefore rejected all change as impossible, and claimed that reality was an undifferentiated and unchanging whole.

These ideas were taken up by various followers of Parmenides, most notably [[Melissus of Samos|Melissus]] and [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]], who provided additional arguments, specifically for the impossibility of [[motion (physics)|motion]]. Melissus claimed that reality was "full" (nonexistence being impossible), and that therefore nothing could move. Zeno gave a series of arguments which were particularly influential. Among the simplest was his observation that to move from A to B, one must first reach the halfway point between A and B; but then in order to do this, one must get halfway from A to this halfway point; and so on. Thus all motion involves an infinite number of steps, which Zeno held to be impossible. A similar argument involved a footrace between [[Achilles]] and a [[tortoise]]. The tortoise is given a headstart. Achilles quickly reaches the point where the tortoise stood, but by this time the tortoise has moved on a little, so Achilles must now reach this new point, and so on. A different argument involved the flight of an [[arrow]]. Zeno observed that if one considers a single moment of time, the arrow is not moving in that moment. He then claimed it was impossible that an arrow in motion could arise as the result of a sequence of motionless arrows.

=== Responses to the Eleatics ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
The [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]] and [[Leucippus]] can be seen as a response to the Eleatic denial of change. The atomists conceded that something coming from or becoming nothing was impossible, but only with respect to [[matter|material substance]], not to general qualities. They hypothesised that every visible object was in fact a composite of unseen indivisible particles of different shapes and sizes. These particles were held to be eternal and unchanging, but by rearranging themselves, the composite objects which they formed could come into and go out of being. These composite objects and their properties were not taken as truly real; in the words of Democritus, "by convention sweet, by convention bitter; by convention hot, by convention cold; by convention colour: but in reality atoms and void." Any perceived change in an object's properties was therefore illusory and not susceptible to the objections of Parmenides.

[[Anaxagoras]] provided a similar response, but instead of atoms, he hypothesised a number of eternal, primal "ingredients" which were mixed together in a [[continuum (measurement)|continuum]]. No material object was made of a pure ingredient; rather, it had its material character due to a preponderance of various ingredients over every other. In this way, Anaxagoras could assert that nowhere did any ingredient ever fully come into or go out of being.

'''Child Identity''' is not only a psychological structure, but also a complex subject of contemporary [[humanitarian science]]. Identity formation is a complex process that is never completed. When we research the problems of identity we want to answer questions 'Who we are?', 'Do we choose our identity?', 'Is identity given to us or do we create our own?', etc. In a world of change, children are faced with many questions and struggles as they sort out their multiple identities. Children begin to ask identity questions at an early age. Who am I? Who is my family? Where do I belong? Why does my family celebrate some holidays and not others? These are all standard questions children ask to determine how they fit into their world. 
 
[[Erik Erikson]] (1902–1994) became one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in problem of child identity. The child identity is a complex socio-cultural phenomenon, which includes a variety of representations of a child about themselves, about the world, about his place in this world. The Child Identity is a dynamic construct that is rapidly changing under the influence of the environment, education and family. In childhood, identity is a dependent phenomenon, there are a lot of the unconscious factors are affecting to behavior patterns, relationships child with world. Child Identity formed under influence of various factors and stereotypes.

== History of question ==

[[Erik Erikson]] was one of the first scientists who described the problems of identity of teenagers and [[crisis identity]]. The development of identity was one of Erikson's greatest concerns in his theory. When [http://www.freud.org.uk/education/topic/40053/anna-freud/ Anna Freud] worked with different children, she opened many original forms of their psychological life. For example, she was the first who described phenomenon 'Identification with the Aggressor' (The Ego, 1936). According to her it was a [[defense mechanism]] that was used to “protect the self from hurt and disorganization”.
Anthropologists have most frequently employed the term ‘identity’ to refer to this idea of selfhood in a loosely Eriksonian way (Erikson 1972) properties based on the uniqueness and individuality which makes a person distinct from others. Identity became of more interest to anthropologists with the emergence of modern concerns with ethnicity and social movements in the 1970s. One of the most interesting research about some elements of ethnic, cultural and gender children's identity was described by [[Margaret Mead]]. [[Jean S. Phinney]] developed a three stage model of ethnic identity development (1992) based on research with minority adolescents combined with other ego identity and ethnic identity models.

== Socialization and child identity ==

Societies are shared communities with complex codes and organizational structures. Socialization is the process by which individuals adapt to and internalize the norms, values, customs, and behaviors of a shared social group (see Lutfey &amp; Mortimer, 2006; Parsons, 1951). The degree to which children learn how to participate and be accepted by society has important consequences for their development and future lives. Importantly, the social codes that children and adolescents learn are specific not only to nation-states and regions of the globe, but also to historical periods and social groups within larger societies. The socio-historical context is a critical dimension of the socialization of children and adolescents, both with respect to their status within society (as compared to adults) as well as their social roles.

Child Identity is in its general sense self-awareness and other-awareness; how much child knows about his likes and dislikes, his beliefs about who he is and what he thinks his capabilities are. Identity is one of key part of child's development. As child's sense of self develops, so does her ability to be successful in school and in social relationships. Just as self-esteem is how he feels about himself, identity is how he thinks about herself. A child with a strong sense of identity might state, “I am a short person, I like pizza, and I am funny.” [9]
Relationships with family members, other adults and children, friends and members of his community play a key role in building child identity. Child Identity includes many questions such as problems of [[gender identity]], [[cultural identity]], [[social identity]], [[national identity]] and others forms of identities. ( [http://www.mediate.com/articles/adler3.cfm 1])

== New research directions ==
 
Today there are many new frames for forming identity of a child. The Child Identity is modern ontological construct. For example, hybrid identity is a result of globalization. Therefore we have phenomenon of [http://ckid.com/what-is-a-tck.html third culture kid (TCK, 3CK)] or '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIlpSavAeag children of global nomads]'. Children raised as global nomads can be the offspring of diplomatic, international business, government agency, international agency, missionary, or military personnel, or indeed of people living internationally mobile lives for any professional reason. Typically, global nomads share a unique cultural heritage.
For many global nomads, nationality will form but one part of a complex identity influenced also by the host countries in which they have lived, by the experience of mobility itself, and by a multicultural heritage forged within one or more international expatriate communities.
The internet has become a big part of contemporary children’s life.  In the 21st century, this typically involves engagement in virtual play worlds. As children play video game s, aspects of their real world and virtual identities interact and learning takes place. [http://video.canadianliving.com/2381748104001/How_to_help_your_kids_develop_a_safe_virtual_identity Children’s Construction of Identity] in Virtual Play Worlds (or online child identity) is one of new research aspects of child identity.
[http://digimed-jhi.pbworks.com/f/Stald%2BMobile%2BIdentity.pdf Mobile child identity] is influenced by his (her) use of media, in particular personal communication media such as the mobile phone. On the other hand, it also implies a view of adolescent identity as mobile, changing and developing moment by moment and over time, as very sensitive to changes in the relations between friends and families, and [http://www.childalert.co.uk/article.php?articles_id=365 to the emotional and intellectual challenges experienced and mediated through the use of the mobile phone] (among other factors).

== Development of identity ==
 {{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
Everybody has a sense of self or sense of personal identity. In fact most people have a number of important ways of thinking about themselves that are significant enough to be considered multiple senses of self. The sense of self includes those roles, attributes, behaviors, etc. These sense-of-self associations can be based on any combination of the following occupations, social relationships, familial relationships, abilities/disabilities, spirituality and others.
In the first few hours of life, children can tell one smell from another, one voice from another-and they prefer their mother's smell and voice to all others. Attachment is part of the process of identity formation. As infants grow emotionally close to certain people, they associate how those people smell, touch, sound; in this way, they are able to recognize their "special people" early on.

Children as young as four years old have a sense of self that is based on some salient attributes that the child considers important and is maintained over time, for example, “I am the strongest or fastest boy in my class” or “I am smart; I figure things out easily” or “I am good at helping people”. Identities are often imposed or at least encouraged by environmental or cultural forces.

Children acquire their sense of self and self-esteem slowly as they mature into adolescents. Furthermore, children do not always feel good about themselves or their behaviors in every situation. Identities are developed over time and may change from time to time and place to place. Furthermore, as children interact with their peers or learn to function in school or some other place, they may feel accepted and liked one moment and alienated the next. Emotional stability and acceptance at home and among school staff are important during these times.

“Construction of identity” is rarely a deliberate, self-conscious process. Early in life, sense of self is associated with the security, protection, and acceptance that infants, toddlers, and preschoolers feel when effectively cared for by adults to whom they feel an attachment. By the late preschool years and early school years, sense of self comes to be additionally associated – positively or negatively – with attributes that parents value and model for their children in the way they live their lives. Over the school years, peer values and peer pressure come to play an increasingly influential role in how older children and young adolescents think about themselves. “Cliques” – the “in crowd” versus the “out crowd” – become important components of identity. Identities that have been strongly developed prior to these years often protect against the developmental difficulties associated with these years.

'''Classical conditioning''' (also known as '''Pavlovian''' or '''respondent conditioning''') refers to a [[learning]] procedure in which a biologically potent [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] (e.g. food) is paired with a previously neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell). It also refers to the learning process that results from this pairing, through which the neutral stimulus comes to elicit a response (e.g. salivation) that is usually similar to the one elicited by the potent stimulus. These basic facts, which require many qualifications (see below), were first studied in detail by [[Ivan Pavlov]] through [[experiment]]s with dogs.  Together with [[operant conditioning]], classical conditioning became the foundation of [[behaviorism]], a school of [[psychology]] which was dominant in the mid-20th century and is still an important influence on the practice of [[Psychotherapy|psychological therapy]] and the study of animal behavior. Classical conditioning is a basic learning process, and its [[neural substrate]]s are now beginning to be understood.

==Definition==
Classical conditioning occurs when a conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US). Usually, the conditioned stimulus is a neutral stimulus (e.g., the sound of a tuning fork), the unconditioned stimulus is biologically potent (e.g., the taste of food) and the unconditioned response (UR) to the unconditioned stimulus is an unlearned [[reflex]] response (e.g., salivation). After pairing is repeated the organism exhibits a conditioned response (CR) to the conditioned stimulus when the conditioned stimulus is presented alone. (A conditioned response may occur after only one pairing.) Thus, unlike the UR, the CR is acquired through experience, and it is also less permanent than the UR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://psychology.about.com/od/cindex/g/condresp.htm |title= What Is a Conditioned Response? |first= Kendra |last= Cherry |work= About.com Guide |publisher= [[About.com]] |location= |accessdate= 2013-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually the conditioned response is similar to the unconditioned response, but sometimes it is quite different. For this and other reasons, most learning theorists suggest that the conditioned stimulus comes to signal or predict the unconditioned stimulus, and go on to analyze the consequences of this signal.&lt;ref name="Shet"&gt;Shettleworth, Sara J.(2010) ''Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior (2nd edn)'' Oxford Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert A. Rescorla]] provided a clear summary of this change in thinking, and its implications, in his 1988 article "Pavlovian conditioning: It's not what you think it is".&lt;ref name="Rescorla1988"&gt;Rescorla, Robert A. [http://www.stanford.edu/class/psych227/RESCORLA%20(1988).pdf Pavlovian Conditioning — It's Not What You Think It Is]. (1988) ''[[American Psychologist]]'', ''43'', 151–160.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its widespread acceptance, Rescorla's thesis may not be defensible.&lt;ref&gt;Papini, M. R., &amp; Bitterman, M. E. (1990). The role of contingency in classical conditioning. ''[[Psychological Review]]'', ''97''(3), 396-403.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical conditioning differs from [[Operant conditioning|''operant'' or ''instrumental'' conditioning]]: in classical conditioning, behaviors are modified through the association of stimuli as described above, whereas in operant conditioning behaviors are modified by the effect they produce (i.e., reward or punishment).&lt;ref name = "Bouton"&gt;Bouton, M. E. (2016) ''Learning and Behavior: A Contemporary Synthesis (2nd ed)'', Sunderland, MA: Sinauer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedures==

===Pavlov's research===
The best-known and most thorough early work on classical conditioning was done by [[Ivan Pavlov]], although [[Edwin Twitmyer]] published some related findings a year earlier.&lt;ref name = "Pavlov"&gt;Pavlov, I. P. (1927/1960). ''Conditional Reflexes''. New York: Dover Publications (the 1960 edition is not an unaltered republication of the 1927 translation by Oxford University Press http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Pavlov/).&lt;/ref&gt; During his research on the physiology of digestion in dogs, Pavlov developed a procedure that enabled him to study the digestive processes of animals over long periods of time. He redirected the animal's digestive fluids outside the body, where they could be measured. Pavlov noticed that his dogs began to salivate in the presence of the technician who normally fed them, rather than simply salivating in the presence of food. Pavlov called the dogs' anticipatory salivation "psychic secretion". Putting these informal observations to an experimental test, Pavlov presented a stimulus (e.g. the sound of a metronome) and then gave the dog food; after a few repetitions, the dogs started to salivate in response to the stimulus. Pavlov concluded that if a particular stimulus in the dog's surroundings was present when the dog was given food then that stimulus could become associated with food and cause salivation on its own.

===Terminology===
In Pavlov's experiments the '''unconditioned stimulus (US)''' was the dog food because its effects did not depend on previous experience.  The metronome's sound is originally a '''neutral stimulus  NS''' because it does not elicit salivation in the dogs.  After conditioning, the metronome's sound becomes the '''conditioned stimulus (CS)'' or conditional stimulus; because its effects depend on its association with food.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas L. Medin, Brian H. Ross, and Arthur B. Markmen. ''Cognitive Psychology''. N.p.:n.p,2009. Print 50–53&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the responses of the dog follow the same conditioned-versus-unconditioned arrangement.  The '''conditioned response (CR)''' is the response to the conditioned stimulus, whereas the '''unconditioned response (UR)''' corresponds to the unconditioned stimulus.

Pavlov reported many basic facts about conditioning; for example, he found that learning occurred most rapidly when the interval between the CS and the appearance of the US was relatively short.&lt;ref&gt;T.L. Brink (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/TLBrink_PSYCH06.pdf "Unit 6: Learning."] pp.&amp;nbsp;97–98&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted earlier, it is often thought that the conditioned response is a replica of the unconditioned response, but Pavlov noted that saliva produced by the CS differs in composition from that produced by the US. In fact, the CR may be any new response to the previously neutral CS that can be clearly linked to experience with the conditional relationship of CS and US.&lt;ref name=Rescorla1988/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bouton"/&gt; It was also thought that repeated pairings are necessary for conditioning to emerge, but many CRs can be learned with a single trial, especially in [[fear conditioning]] and [[taste aversion]] learning.

[[Image:delay,trace conditioning.svg|thumb|right|384px|Diagram representing forward conditioning. The time interval increases from left to right.]]

===Forward conditioning===
Learning is fastest in forward conditioning. During forward conditioning, the onset of the CS precedes the onset of the US in order to signal that the US will follow.&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;Chang, Raymond C.; Stout, Steven; Miller, Ralph R. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raymond_Chang/publication/8945976_Comparing_excitatory_backward_and_forward_conditioning/links/5404a9f60cf23d9765a6919f.pdf "Comparing excitatory backward and forward conditioning."] ''Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology: Section B'' January 2004. Vol. 57 Issue 1, pp. 1–23. State University of New York at Binghamton, New York, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chance, Paul. Learning and Behavior. Belmont/CA: Wadsworth, {{ISBN|0-495-09564-8}}, 2008. Print. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Two common forms of forward conditioning are delay and trace conditioning.

* '''Delay conditioning''': In delay conditioning, the CS is presented and is overlapped by the presentation of the US. For example, if a person hears a buzzer for five seconds, during which time air is puffed into their eye, the person will blink. After several pairings of the buzzer and the puff, the person will blink at the sound of the buzzer alone. This is delay conditioning.
* '''Trace conditioning''': During trace conditioning, the CS and US do not overlap. Instead, the CS begins and ends before the US is presented. The stimulus-free period is called the ''trace interval'' or the ''conditioning interval''. If in the above buzzer example, the puff came a second after the sound of the buzzer stopped, that would be trace conditioning, with a trace or conditioning interval of one second.
[[File:Forward Conditioning.svg]]

===Simultaneous conditioning===
[[File:Classical Conditioning.svg|thumb|Classical conditioning procedures and effects]]

During simultaneous conditioning, the CS and US are presented and terminated at the same time. For example: If a person hears a bell and has air puffed into their eye at the same time, and repeated pairings like this lead to the person blinking when they hear the bell despite the puff of air being absent, this demonstrates that simultaneous conditioning has occurred.

[[File:Simultaneous Conditioning.svg]]

===Second-order and higher-order conditioning===
{{main|Second-order conditioning}}
Second-order or higher-order conditioning follow a two-step procedure. First a neutral stimulus ("CS1") comes to signal a US through forward conditioning. Then a second neutral stimulus ("CS2") is paired with the first (CS1) and comes to yield its own conditioned response.&lt;ref&gt;Chance, Paul. ''Learning and Behavior''. Belmont/CA: Wadsworth, {{ISBN|0-495-09564-8}}, 2008. Print. p.66&lt;/ref&gt; For example: A bell might be paired with food until the bell elicits salivation. If a light is then paired with the bell, then the light may come to elicit salivation as well. The bell is the CS1 and the food is the US. The light becomes the CS2 once it is paired with the CS1.

[[File:Second Order Conditioning.svg]]

===Backward conditioning===
Backward conditioning occurs when a CS immediately follows a US.&lt;ref name="Chang"/&gt; Unlike the usual conditioning procedure, in which the CS precedes the US, the conditioned response given to the CS tends to be inhibitory. This presumably happens because the CS serves as a signal that the US has ended, rather than as a signal that the US is about to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Chance, Paul. ''Learning and Behavior''. Belmont/CA: Wadsworth, {{ISBN|0-495-09564-8}}, 2008. Print. pp.71&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a puff of air directed at a person's eye could be followed by the sound of a buzzer.

===Temporal conditioning===
In temporal conditioning, a US is presented at regular intervals, for instance every 10 minutes. Conditioning is said to have occurred when the CR tends to occur shortly before each US. This suggests that animals have a biological clock that can serve as a CS. This method has also been used to study timing ability in animals (see [[Animal cognition]]).

The example below shows the temporal conditioning, as US such as food to a hungry mouse is simply delivered on a regular time schedule such as every thirty seconds. After sufficient exposure the mouse will begin to salivate just before the food delivery. This then makes it temporal conditioning as it would appear that the mouse is conditioned to the passage of time. (see [[Basic Principle of Learning]]).
[[File:Temporal Conditioning.svg]]

===Zero contingency procedure===
In this procedure, the CS is paired with the US, but the US also occurs at other times. If this occurs, it is predicted that the US is likely to happen in the absence of the CS. In other words, the CS does not "predict" the US. In this case, conditioning fails and the CS does not come to elicit a CR.&lt;ref&gt;Rescorla, R. A. (1967). [http://www.uk.sagepub.com/upm-data/23600_Ch_1.pdf Pavlovian conditioning and its proper control procedures].  ''Psychological Review'', 74, 71–80&lt;/ref&gt; This finding – that ''prediction'' rather than CS-US pairing is the key to conditioning – greatly influenced subsequent conditioning research and theory.

===Extinction===
{{main|Extinction (psychology)}}
In the extinction procedure, the CS is presented repeatedly in the absence of a US. This is done after a CS has been conditioned by one of the methods above. When this is done, the CR frequency eventually returns to pre-training levels. However, extinction does not completely eliminate the effects of the prior conditioning. This is demonstrated by [[spontaneous recovery]] – when there is a sudden appearance of the (CR) after extinction occurs – and other related phenomena (see "Recovery from extinction" below). These phenomena can be explained by postulating accumulation of inhibition when a weak stimulus is presented.

==Phenomena observed==

===Acquisition===
During acquisition, the CS and US are paired as described above. The extent of conditioning may be tracked by test trials. In these test trials, the CS is presented alone and the CR is measured. A single CS-US pairing may suffice to yield a CR on a test, but usually a number of pairings are necessary and there is a gradual increase in the conditioned response to the CS. This repeated number of trials increase the strength and/or frequency of the CR gradually. The speed of conditioning depends on a number of factors, such as the nature and strength of both the CS and the US, previous experience and the animal's [[motivation]]al state.&lt;ref name="Shet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bouton"/&gt; The process slows down as it nears completion.&lt;ref name="Schacter 2009 267"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel L|title=PSYCHOLOGY|year=2009|publisher=Catherine Woods|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extinction===
If the CS is presented without the US, and this process is repeated continuously, the CS will eventually stop eliciting a CR. This means that the CR has been "extinguished".&lt;ref name = Shet/&gt; This occurs due to a temporal sensitive relationship between the US and CS. The cessation or long temporal delay of CS-US pairing results in a learned decision to stop responding to a CS since there is a sufficient change in the rate at which the CS is being reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=C. K. J.|last2=Harris|first2=Justin A.|date=2017-08-01|title=Extinction of Pavlovian conditioning: The influence of trial number and reinforcement history|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635717301961|journal=Behavioural Processes|series=SQAB 2016: Persistence and Relapse|volume=141|issue=Part 1|pages=19–25|doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2017.04.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[File:Classical conditioning - extinction.svg]]

===External inhibition===
[[External inhibition]] may be observed if a strong or unfamiliar stimulus is presented just before, or at the same time as, the CS. This causes a reduction in the conditioned response to the CS.

===Recovery from extinction===
Several procedures lead to the recovery of a CR that had been first conditioned and then extinguished. This illustrates that the extinction procedure does not completely eliminate the effect of conditioning.&lt;ref name = "Bouton"/&gt; These procedures are the following:
* Reacquisition: If the CS is again paired with the US, a CR is again acquired, but this second acquisition usually happens much faster than the first one.
* [[Spontaneous recovery]]: Spontaneous recovery is defined as the reappearance of a previously extinguished conditioned response after a rest period. That is, if the CS is tested at a later time (for example an hour or a day) after extinction it will again elicit a CR. This renewed CR is usually much weaker than the CR observed prior to extinction.
* [[Disinhibition#Associative learning concept|Disinhibition]]: If the CS is tested just after extinction and an intense but associatively neutral stimulus has occurred, there may be a temporary recovery of the conditioned response to the CS.
* Reinstatement: If the US used in conditioning is presented to a subject in the same place where conditioning and extinction occurred, but without the CS being present, the CS often elicits a response when it is tested later.
* Renewal: Renewal is a reemergence of a conditioned response following extinction when an animal is returned to the environment in which the conditioned response was acquired.

===Stimulus generalization===
''Stimulus generalization'' is said to occur if, after a particular CS has come to elicit a CR, another similar stimulus will elicit the same CR. Usually the more similar the CS and the test stimulus are, the stronger the CR to the test stimulus.&lt;ref name = Shet/&gt; The more the test stimulus differs from the CS, the weaker the CR will be, or the more it will differ from that previously observed.

===Stimulus discrimination===
One observes ''stimulus discrimination'' when one stimulus ("CS1") elicits one CR and another stimulus ("CS2") elicits either another CR or no CR at all. This can be brought about by, for example, pairing CS1 with an effective US and presenting CS2 with no US.&lt;ref name = Shet/&gt;

===Latent inhibition===
{{main|Latent inhibition}}
Latent inhibition refers to the observation that it takes longer for a familiar stimulus to become a CS than it does for a novel stimulus to become a CS, when the stimulus is subsequently paired with an effective US.&lt;ref name = Shet/&gt;

===Conditioned suppression===
This is one of the most common ways to measure the strength of learning in classical conditioning. A typical example of this procedure is as follows: a rat first learns to press a lever through [[operant conditioning]].  Then, in a series of trials, the rat is exposed to a CS, a light or a noise, followed by the US, a mild electric shock.  An association between the CS and US develops, and the rat slows or stops its lever pressing when the CS comes on. The rate of pressing during the CS measures the strength of classical conditioning; that is, the slower the rat presses, the stronger the association of the CS and the US. (Slow pressing indicates a "fear" conditioned response, and it is an example of a conditioned emotional response; see section below.)

===Conditioned inhibition===
Typically, three phases of conditioning are used.

====Phase 1====
A CS (CS+) is paired with a US until asymptotic CR levels are reached.

====Phase 2====
CS+/US trials are continued, but these are interspersed with trials on which the CS+ is paired with a second CS, (the CS-) but not with the US (i.e. CS+/CS- trials).  Typically, organisms show CRs on CS+/US trials, but stop responding on CS+/CS− trials.

====Phase 3====
* ''Summation test for conditioned inhibition:'' The CS- from phase 2 is presented together with a new CS+ that was conditioned as in phase 1. Conditioned inhibition is found if the response is less to the CS+/CS- pair than it is to the CS+ alone.
* ''Retardation test for conditioned inhibition:'' The CS- from phase 2 is paired with the US. If conditioned inhibition has occurred, the rate of acquisition to the previous CS− should be less than the rate of acquisition that would be found without the phase 2 treatment.

===Blocking===
{{main|Blocking effect}}
This form of classical conditioning involves two phases.

====Phase 1====
A CS (CS1) is paired with a US.

====Phase 2====
A compound CS (CS1+CS2) is paired with a US.

====Test====
A separate test for each CS (CS1 and CS2) is performed. The blocking effect is observed in a lack of conditional response to CS2, suggesting that the first phase of training blocked the acquisition of the second CS.

[[File:Classical conditioning - blocking.svg]]

==Theories==

===Data sources===

Experiments on theoretical issues in conditioning have mostly been done on vertebrates, especially rats and pigeons. However, conditioning has also been studied in invertebrates, and very important data on the neural basis of conditioning has come from experiments on the sea slug, ''Aplysia''.&lt;ref&gt;Shettleworth, S. J. (2010) ''Cognition, Evolution and Behavior'' (2nd Ed), New York: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most relevant experiments have used the classical conditioning procedure, although [[Operant conditioning|instrumental (operant) conditioning]] experiments have also been used, and the strength of classical conditioning is often measured through its operant effects, as in ''conditioned suppression'' (see Phenomena section above) and [[Shaping (psychology)|autoshaping]].

===Stimulus-substitution theory===
{{further|Counterconditioning}}
According to Pavlov, conditioning does not involve the acquisition of any new behavior, but rather the tendency to respond in old ways to new stimuli. Thus, he theorized that the CS merely substitutes for the US in evoking the reflex response. This explanation is called the stimulus-substitution theory of conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Chance, Paul. ''Learning and Behavior''. Belmont/CA: Wadsworth, {{ISBN|0-495-09564-8}}, 2008. Print. p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; A critical problem with the stimulus-substitution theory is that the CR and UR are not always the same. Pavlov himself observed that a dog's saliva produced as a CR differed in composition from that produced as a UR.&lt;ref name="Pavlov"/&gt; The CR is sometimes even the opposite of the UR. For example: the unconditional response to electric shock is an increase in heart rate, whereas a CS that has been paired with the electric shock elicits a decrease in heart rate. (However, it has been proposed that only when the UR does not involve the [[central nervous system]] are the CR and the UR opposites.)

===Rescorla–Wagner model===
{{main|Rescorla–Wagner model}}

The Rescorla–Wagner (R–W) model&lt;ref name="Bouton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rescorla,  R. A. &amp; A. R. Wagner (1972). A theory of Pavlovan conditioning: Variations in the effectiveness of reinforcement and nonreinforcement.  In ''Classical Conditioning II: Current Theory and Research'' Black &amp; Prokasy (eds), pp. 64–99. New York: Appleton-Century.&lt;/ref&gt;  is a relatively simple yet powerful model of conditioning.  The model predicts a number of important phenomena, but it also fails in important ways, thus leading to a number of modifications and alternative models.  However, because much of the theoretical research on conditioning in the past 40 years has been instigated by this model or reactions to it, the R–W model deserves a brief description here.&lt;ref name = "M&amp;E"&gt;Miller, R. &amp; M. Escobar ''Learning: Laws and Models of Basic Conditioning''.  In ''Stevens' Handbook of Experimental Psychology'',(3rd Edition)  Vol 3: Learning, Motivation &amp; Emotion, Pashler &amp; Gallistel, (eds) pp 47–102, New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chance, Paul. ''Learning and Behavior''. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, {{ISBN|0-495-09564-8}}, 2008. Print. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rescorla-Wagner model argues that there is a limit to the amount of conditioning that can occur in the pairing of two stimuli. One determinant of this limit is the nature of the US. For example: pairing a bell with a juicy steak is more likely to produce salivation than pairing the bell with a piece of dry bread, and dry bread is likely to work better than a piece of cardboard.  A key idea behind the R–W model is that a CS signals or predicts the US. One might say that before conditioning, the subject is surprised by the US. However, after conditioning, the subject is no longer surprised, because the CS predicts the coming of the US. (Note that the model can be described mathematically and that words like predict, surprise, and expect are only used to help explain the model.) Here the workings of the model are illustrated with brief accounts of acquisition, extinction, and blocking.  The model also predicts a number of other phenomena, see main article on the model.

==== Equation ====
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\Delta V=\alpha\beta (\lambda - \Sigma V)&lt;/math&gt;

This is the Rescorla-Wagner equation. It specifies the amount of learning that will occur on a single pairing of a conditioning stimulus (CS) with an unconditioned stimulus (US). The above equation is solved repeatedly to predict the course of learning over many such trials.

In this model the degree of learning is measured by how well the CS predicts the US, which is given by the "associative strength" of the CS. In the equation, V represents the current associative strength of the CS, and ∆V is the change in this strength that happens on a given trial. ΣV is the sum of the strengths of all stimuli present in the situation. λ is the maximum associative strength that a given US will support; its value is usually set to 1 on trials when the US is present, and 0 when the US is absent. α and β are constants related to the salience of the CS and the speed of learning for a given US. How the equation predicts various experimental results is explained in following sections.  For further details, see the main article on the model.&lt;ref&gt;Chance, Paul. ''Learning and Behavior''. Belmont/CA: Wadsworth, {{ISBN|0-495-09564-8}}, 2008. Print pp 85–89&lt;/ref&gt;

====R–W model: acquisition====
The R–W model measures conditioning by assigning an "associative strength" to the CS and other local stimuli.  Before a CS is conditioned it has an associative strength of zero. Pairing the CS and the US causes a gradual increase in the associative strength of the CS. This increase is determined by the nature of the US (e.g. its intensity).&lt;ref name="Chance, Paul 2008. pp. 85-89"&gt;Chance, Paul. ''Learning and Behavior''. Belmont/CA: Wadsworth, {{ISBN|0-495-09564-8}}, 2008. Print. pp. 85–89&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of learning that happens during any single CS-US pairing depends on the difference between the total associative strengths of CS and other stimuli present in the situation (ΣV in the equation), and a maximum set by the US (λ in the equation). On the first pairing of the CS and US, this difference is large and the associative strength of the CS takes a big step up. As CS-US pairings accumulate, the US becomes more predictable, and the increase in associative strength on each trial becomes smaller and smaller.  Finally the difference between the associative strength of the CS (plus any that may accrue to other stimuli) and the maximum strength reaches zero. That is, the US is fully predicted, the associative strength of the CS stops growing, and conditioning is complete.

====R–W model: extinction====
The associative process described by the R–W model also accounts for extinction (see "procedures" above).  The extinction procedure starts with a positive associative strength of the CS, which means that the CS predicts that the US will occur.  On an extinction trial the US fails to occur after the CS.  As a result of this “surprising” outcome, the associative strength of the CS takes a step down. Extinction is complete when the strength of the CS reaches zero; no US is predicted, and no US occurs. However, if that same CS is presented without the US but accompanied by a well-established conditioned inhibitor (CI), that is, a stimulus that predicts the absence of a US (in R-W terms, a stimulus with a negative associate strength) then R-W predicts that the CS will not undergo extinction (its V will not decrease in size).

====R–W model: blocking====
{{main|Blocking effect}}
The most important and novel contribution of the R–W model is its assumption that the conditioning of a CS depends not just on that CS alone, and its relationship to the US, but also on all other stimuli present in the conditioning situation.  In particular, the model states that the US is predicted by the sum of the associative strengths of all stimuli present in the conditioning situation.  Learning is controlled by the difference between this total associative strength and the strength supported by the US. When this sum of strengths reaches a maximum set by the US, conditioning ends as just described.&lt;ref name="Chance, Paul 2008. pp. 85-89"/&gt;

The R–W explanation of the blocking phenomenon illustrates one consequence of the assumption just stated.  In blocking (see "phenomena" above), CS1 is paired with a US until conditioning is complete. Then on additional conditioning trials a second stimulus (CS2) appears together with CS1, and both are followed by the US.  Finally CS2 is tested and shown to produce no response because learning about CS2 was “blocked” by the initial learning about CS1.  The R–W model explains this by saying that after the initial conditioning, CS1 fully predicts the US.  Since there is no difference between what is predicted and what happens, no new learning happens on the additional trials with CS1+CS2, hence CS2 later yields no response.

===Theoretical issues and alternatives to the Rescorla–Wagner model===
One of the main reasons for the importance of the R–W model is that it is relatively simple and makes clear predictions.  Tests of these predictions have led to a number of important new findings and a considerably increased understanding of conditioning.  Some new information has supported the theory, but much has not, and it is generally agreed that the theory is, at best, too simple. However, no single model seems to account for all the phenomena that experiments have produced.&lt;ref name = "Bouton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, R. R., Barnet, R. C. &amp; Grahame, N. J. (1995) Assessment of the Rescorla–Wagner model. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 117, 363–386&lt;/ref&gt;   Following are brief summaries of some related theoretical issues.&lt;ref name="M&amp;E"/&gt;

====Content of learning====
The R–W model reduces conditioning to the association of a CS and US, and measures this with a single number, the associative strength of the CS.  A number of experimental findings indicate that more is learned than this. Among these are two phenomena described earlier in this article
* Latent inhibition:  If a subject is repeatedly exposed to the CS before conditioning starts, then conditioning takes longer.  The R–W model cannot explain this because preexposure leaves the strength of the CS unchanged at zero.
* Recovery of responding after extinction:  It appears that something remains after extinction has reduced associative strength to zero because several procedures cause responding to reappear without further conditioning.&lt;ref name = "Bouton"/&gt;

====Role of attention in learning====
Latent inhibition might happen because a subject stops focusing on a CS that is seen frequently before it is paired with a US.  In fact, changes in attention to the CS are at the heart of two prominent theories that try to cope with experimental results that give the R–W model difficulty.  In one of these, proposed by [[Nicholas Mackintosh]],&lt;ref&gt;Mackintosh, N. J. (1975) A theory of attention: Variations in the associability of stimuli with reinforcement  ''Psychological Review'', 82, 276–298&lt;/ref&gt; the speed of conditioning depends on the amount of attention devoted to the CS, and this amount of attention depends in turn on how well the CS predicts the US.  Pearce and Hall proposed a related model based on a different attentional principle&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, J. M. &amp; Hall, G. (1980) [http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~elliot/PearceHall1980_PsychReview.pdf A model for Pavlovian learning: Variations in the effectiveness of conditioned but not of unconditioned stimuli] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407081232/http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~elliot/PearceHall1980_PsychReview.pdf |date=2014-04-07 }}. ''Psychological Review'', 87, 532–552.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both models have been extensively tested, and neither explains all the experimental results. Consequently, various authors have attempted hybrid models that combine the two attentional processes. Pearce and Hall in 2010 integrated their attentional ideas and even suggested the possibility of incorporating the Rescorla-Wagner equation into an integrated model.&lt;ref name="Bouton"/&gt;

====Context====
As stated earlier, a key idea in conditioning is that the CS signals or predicts the US  (see "zero contingency procedure" above).  However, for example, the room in which conditioning takes place also "predicts" that the US may occur. Still, the room predicts with much less certainty than does the experimental CS itself, because the room is also there between experimental trials, when the US is absent. The role of such context is illustrated by the fact that the dogs in Pavlov's experiment would sometimes start salivating as they approached the experimental apparatus, before they saw or heard any CS.&lt;ref name="Schacter 2009 267"/&gt; Such so-called "context" stimuli are always present, and their influence helps to account for some otherwise puzzling experimental findings. The associative strength of context stimuli can be entered into the Rescorla-Wagner equation, and they play an important role in the ''comparator'' and ''computational'' theories outlined below.&lt;ref name = "Bouton"/&gt;

====Comparator theory====
To find out what has been learned, we must somehow measure behavior ("performance") in a test situation. However, as students know all too well, performance in a test situation is not always a good measure of what has been learned.  As for conditioning, there is evidence that subjects in a blocking experiment do learn something about the "blocked" CS, but fail to show this learning because of the way that they are usually tested.

"Comparator" theories of conditioning are "performance based", that is, they stress what is going on at the time of the test.  In particular, they look at all the stimuli that are present during testing and at how the associations acquired by these stimuli may interact.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, J. &amp; Balsam P. (1981) Spreading association in time.  In Locurto, Terrace &amp; Gibbon (Eds.), ''Autoshaping and conditioning theory'' (pp. 219–235). New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, R. R. &amp; Escobar, M. (2001) [http://faculty.oxy.edu/clint/learn/articles/contrastingacquisitionfocusedandperformancefocusedmodelsofacquiredbehavior.pdf Contrasting acquisition-focused and performance-focused models of acquired behavior]. ''Current Directions in Psychological Science'' 10, 141–145.&lt;/ref&gt;  To oversimplify somewhat, comparator theories assume that during conditioning the subject acquires both CS-US and context-US associations. At the time of the test, these associations are compared, and a response to the CS occurs only if the CS-US association is stronger than the context-US association. After a CS and US are repeatedly paired in simple acquisition, the CS-US association is strong and the context-US association is relatively weak. This means that the CS elicits a strong CR. In “zero contingency” (see above), the conditioned response is weak or absent because the context-US association is about as strong as the CS-US association. Blocking and other more subtle phenomena can also be explained by comparator theories, though, again, they cannot explain everything.&lt;ref name="Bouton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M&amp;E"/&gt;

====Computational theory====
An organism's need to predict future events is central to modern theories of conditioning. Most theories use associations between stimuli to take care of these predictions. For example: In the R–W model, the associative strength of a CS tells us how strongly that CS predicts a US. A different approach to prediction is suggested by models such as that proposed by Gallistel &amp; Gibbon (2000, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Gallistel, R. &amp; Gibbon, J. (2000). [http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/faculty/GnG/Gal&amp;Gib_Preprint.pdf Time, rate and conditioning]. ''Psychological Review'', 107, 289–304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallistel, R. &amp; Gibbon, J. (2002) ''The Symbolic Foundations of Conditioned Behavior''. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Here the response is not determined by associative strengths.  Instead, the organism records the times of onset and offset of CSs and USs and uses these to calculate the probability that the US will follow the CS. A number of experiments have shown that humans and animals can learn to time events (see [[Animal cognition]]), and the Gallistel &amp; Gibbon model yields very good quantitative fits to a variety of experimental data.&lt;ref name = "Shet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M&amp;E"/&gt; However, recent studies have suggested that duration-based models cannot account for some empirical findings as well as associative models.&lt;ref&gt;Golkar, A., Bellander, M., &amp; Öhman, A. (2013). Temporal properties of fear extinction--does time matter? "Behavioral neuroscience", 127(1), 59–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Element-based models====
The Rescorla-Wagner model treats a stimulus as a single entity, and it represents the associative strength of a stimulus with one number, with no record of how that number was reached.  As noted above, this makes it hard for the model to account for a number of experimental results.  More flexibility is provided by assuming that a stimulus is internally represented by a collection of elements, each of which may change from one associative state to another. For example, the similarity of one stimulus to another may be represented by saying that the two stimuli share elements in common.  These shared elements help to account for stimulus generalization and other phenomena that may depend upon generalization.  Also, different elements within the same set may have different associations, and their activations and associations may change at different times and at different rates.  This allows element-based models to handle some otherwise inexplicable results.

=====The SOP model=====
A prominent example of the element approach is the “SOP” model of Wagner.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, A. R. (1981). SOP: A model of automatic memory processing in animal behavior.  In Spear &amp; Miller (Eds.) Information processing in animals: Memory mechanisms (pp.5-47). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt;  The model has been elaborated in various ways since its introduction, and it can now account in principle for a very wide variety of experimental findings.&lt;ref name="Bouton"/&gt;  The model represents any given stimulus with a large collection of elements. The time of presentation of various stimuli, the state of their elements, and the interactions between the elements, all determine the course of associative processes and the behaviors observed during conditioning experiments.

The SOP account of simple conditioning exemplifies some essentials of the SOP model.  To begin with, the model assumes that the CS and US are each represented by a large group of elements. Each of these stimulus elements can be in one of three states: 
* primary activity (A1)  - Roughly speaking, the stimulus is  “attended to.”  (References to “attention” are intended only to aid understanding and are not part of the model.)
* secondary activity (A2)  -  The stimulus is “peripherally attended to.”
* inactive (I) – The stimulus is “not attended to.”
Of the elements that represent a single stimulus at a given moment, some may be in state A1, some in state A2, and some in state I.

When a stimulus first appears, some of its elements jump from inactivity I to primary activity A1. From the A1 state they gradually decay to A2, and finally back to I.  Element activity can only change in this way; in particular, elements in A2 cannot go directly back to A1.  If the elements of both the CS and the US are in the A1 state at the same time, an association is learned between the two stimuli.  This means that if, at a later time, the CS is presented ahead of the US, and some CS elements enter A1, these elements will activate some US elements.  However, US elements activated indirectly in this way only get boosted to the A2 state.  (This can be thought of the CS arousing a memory of the US, which will not be as strong as the real thing.)   With repeated CS-US trials, more and more elements are associated, and more and more US elements go to A2 when the CS comes on. This gradually leaves fewer and fewer US elements that can enter A1 when the US itself appears. In consequence, learning slows down and approaches a limit. One might say that the US is “fully predicted” or “not surprising” because almost all of its elements can only enter A2 when the CS comes on, leaving few to form new associations.

The model can explain the findings that are accounted for by the Rescorla-Wagner model and a number of additional findings as well.  For example, unlike most other models, SOP takes time into account. The rise and decay of element activation enables the model to explain time-dependent effects such as the fact that conditioning is strongest when the CS comes just before the US, and that when the CS comes after the US  (“backward conditioning”) the result is often an inhibitory CS.  Many other more subtle phenomena are explained as well.&lt;ref name="Bouton"/&gt;
 
A number of other powerful models have appeared in recent years which incorporate element representations.  These often include the assumption that associations involve a network of connections between “nodes” that represent stimuli, responses, and perhaps one or more “hidden” layers of intermediate interconnections.  Such models make contact with a current explosion of research on [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]].

==Applications==

===Neural basis of learning and memory===

Pavlov proposed that conditioning involved a connection between brain centers for conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. His physiological account of conditioning has been abandoned, but classical conditioning continues to be to study the neural structures and functions that underlie learning and memory. Forms of classical conditioning that are used for this purpose include, among others, [[fear conditioning]], [[eyeblink conditioning]], and the foot contraction conditioning of ''[[Hermissenda crassicornis]]'', a sea-slug. Both fear and eyeblink conditioning involve a neutral stimulus, frequently a tone, becoming paired with an unconditioned stimulus.  In the case of eyeblink conditioning, the US is an air-puff, while in fear conditioning the US is threatening or aversive such as a foot shock.

"Available data demonstrate that discrete regions of the cerebellum and associated brainstem areas contain neurons that alter their activity during conditioning – these regions are critical for the acquisition and performance of this simple learning task. It appears that other regions of the brain, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex, contribute to the conditioning process, especially when the demands of the task get more complex."&lt;ref&gt;Steinmetz, J. E. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=RMH8iUZdAFYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Neural%20Basis%20of%20Classical%20Conditioning%22&amp;f=false Neural Basis of Classical Conditioning]" in Encyclopedia of Behavioral Neuroscience, Academic Press, 2010, pp 313-319s&lt;/ref&gt;

Fear and eyeblink conditioning involve generally non overlapping neural circuitry, but share molecular mechanisms.  
Fear conditioning occurs in the basolateral amygdala, which receives glutaminergic input directly from thalamic afferents, as well as indirectly from prefrontal projections.  The direct projections are sufficient for delay conditioning, but in the case of trace conditioning, where the CS needs to be internally represented despite a lack of external stimulus, indirect pathways are necessary.  The anterior cingulate is one candidate for intermediate trace conditioning, but the hippocampus may also play a major role. Presynaptic activation of [[protein kinase A]] and postsynaptic activation of [[NMDA receptor]]s and its signal transduction pathway are necessary for conditioning related plasticity.  [[CREB]] is also necessary for conditioning related plasticity, and it may induce downstream synthesis of proteins necessary for this to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fanselow|first1=Michael S.|last2=Poulos|first2=Andrew M|title=The Neuroscience of Mammalian Associative Learning|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=February 2005|volume=56|issue=1|pages=207–234|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070213}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As NMDA receptors are only activated after an increase in presynaptic calcium(thereby releasing the Mg2+ block), they are a potential coincidence detector that could mediate [[spike timing dependent plasticity]].  STDP constrains LTP to situations where the CS predicts the US, and LTD to the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markram|first1=H|last2=Gerstner|first2=W|last3=Sjöström|first3=PJ|title=A history of spike-timing-dependent plasticity.|journal=Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience|date=2011|volume=3|pages=4|doi=10.3389/fnsyn.2011.00004|pmid=22007168|pmc=3187646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioral therapies===
{{main|Behavior therapy}}
Some therapies associated with classical conditioning are [[aversion therapy]], [[systematic desensitization]] and [[flooding (psychology)|flooding]].
Aversion therapy is a type of behavior therapy designed to make patients cease an undesirable habit by associating the habit with a strong unpleasant unconditioned stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, Christopher A. ''Abnormal Psychology and Life: A Dimensional Approach''. N.p.: n.p., January 1, 2011. Print. p.336&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a medication might be used to associate the taste of alcohol with stomach upset. Systematic desensitization is a treatment for phobias in which the patient is trained to relax while being exposed to progressively more anxiety-provoking stimuli (e.g. angry words). This is an example of [[counterconditioning]], intended to associate the feared stimuli with a response (relaxation) that is incompatible with anxiety&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, Christopher A. ''Abnormal Psychology and Life: A Dimensional Approach''. N.p.: n.p., January 1, 2011. Print. p 136&lt;/ref&gt; Flooding is a form of desensitization that attempts to eliminate phobias and anxieties by repeated exposure to highly distressing stimuli until the lack of reinforcement of the anxiety response causes its extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, Christopher A. ''Abnormal Psychology and Life: A Dimensional Approach''. N.p.: n.p., January 1, 2011. Print. p 133&lt;/ref&gt; "Flooding" usually involves actual exposure to the stimuli, whereas the term "implosion" refers to imagined exposure, but the two terms are sometimes used synonymously.

Conditioning therapies usually take less time than [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]] therapies.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, Donald Loring. ''Behavior Modification.'' Wellness.com, Inc. 2006. Retrieved on 2012-2-14. http://www.wellness.com/reference/health-and-wellness/behavior-modification&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conditioned drug response===
A stimulus that is present when a drug is administered or consumed may eventually evoke a conditioned physiological response that mimics the effect of the drug. This is sometimes the case with caffeine; habitual coffee drinkers may find that the smell of coffee gives them a feeling of alertness. In other cases, the conditioned response is a compensatory reaction that tends to offset the effects of the drug. For example, if a drug causes the body to become less sensitive to pain, the compensatory conditioned reaction may be one that makes the user more sensitive to pain. This compensatory reaction may contribute to [[drug tolerance]]. If so, a drug user may increase the amount of drug consumed in order to feel its effects, and end up taking very large amounts of the drug. In this case a dangerous overdose reaction may occur if the CS happens to be absent, so that the conditioned compensatory effect fails to occur. For example, if the drug has always been administered in the same room, the stimuli provided by that room may produce a conditioned compensatory effect; then an overdose reaction may happen if the drug is administered in a different location where the conditioned stimuli are absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology: The Science of Behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=New Jersey, United States|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|pages=599–604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conditioned hunger{{anchor|Conditioned hunger}}===
Signals that consistently precede food intake can become conditioned stimuli for a set of bodily responses that prepares the body for food and digestion. These reflexive responses include the secretion of digestive juices into the stomach and the secretion of certain hormones into the blood stream, and they induce a state of hunger. An example of conditioned hunger is the "appetizer effect." Any signal that consistently precedes a meal, such as a clock indicating that it is time for dinner, can cause people to feel hungrier than before the signal. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is involved in the initiation of eating. The nigrostriatal pathway, which includes the substantia nigra, the lateral hypothalamus, and the basal ganglia have been shown to be involved in hunger motivation.

===Conditioned emotional response{{anchor|Conditioned emotional response}}===
{{further|Conditioned emotional response|Fear conditioning}}
The influence of classical conditioning can be seen in emotional responses such as [[phobia]], disgust, nausea, anger, and sexual arousal. A familiar example is conditioned nausea, in which the CS is the sight or smell of a particular food that in the past has resulted in an unconditioned stomach upset. Similarly, when the CS is the sight of a dog and the US is the pain of being bitten, the result may be a conditioned fear of dogs. An example of conditioned emotional response is [[#Conditioned suppression|conditioned suppression]].

As an adaptive mechanism, emotional conditioning helps shield an individual from harm or prepare it for important biological events such as sexual activity. Thus, a stimulus that has occurred before sexual interaction comes to cause sexual arousal, which prepares the individual for sexual contact. For example, sexual arousal has been conditioned in human subjects by pairing a stimulus like a picture of a jar of pennies with views of an erotic film clip. Similar experiments involving blue gourami fish and domesticated quail have shown that such conditioning can increase the number of offspring. These results suggest that conditioning techniques might help to increase fertility rates in infertile individuals and endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology: The Science of Behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=New Jersey, United States|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|pages=198–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pavlovian-instrumental transfer===
{{Main|Pavlovian-instrumental transfer}}
{{expand section|date=May 2017}}
Pavlovian-instrumental transfer is a phenomenon that occurs when a conditioned stimulus (CS, also known as a "cue") that has been associated with [[reward system|rewarding]] or [[aversives|aversive]] [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] via classical conditioning alters [[motivational salience]] and [[operant behavior]].&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cartoni E, Puglisi-Allegra S, Baldassarre G | title = The three principles of action: a Pavlovian-instrumental transfer hypothesis | journal = Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 153 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24312025 | pmc = 3832805 | doi = 10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00153 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aversive PIT in humans - review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geurts DE, Huys QJ, den Ouden HE, Cools R | title = Aversive Pavlovian control of instrumental behavior in humans | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 25 | issue = 9 | pages = 1428–1441 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23691985 | doi = 10.1162/jocn_a_00425 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer of reward - review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cartoni E, Balleine B, Baldassarre G | title = Appetitive Pavlovian-instrumental Transfer: A review | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 829–848 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27693227 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.09.020 | quote = This paper reviews one of the experimental paradigms used to study the effects of cues, the Pavlovian to Instrumental Transfer paradigm. In this paradigm, cues associated with rewards through Pavlovian conditioning alter motivation and choice of instrumental actions.&amp;nbsp;... Predictive cues are an important part of our life that continuously influence and guide our actions. Hearing the sound of a horn makes us stop before we attempt to cross the street. Seeing an advertisement for fast food might make us hungry and lead us to seek out a specific type and source of food. In general, cues can both prompt us towards or stop us from engaging in a certain course of action. They can be adaptive (saving our life in crossing the street) or maladaptive, leading to suboptimal choices, e.g. making us eat when we are not really hungry (Colagiuri and Lovibond, 2015). In extreme cases they can even play a part in pathologies such as in addiction, where drug associated cues produce craving and provoke relapse (Belin et al., 2009).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic computation of reward motivation review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC | title = From prediction error to incentive salience: mesolimbic computation of reward motivation | journal = Eur.

This is a signature feature of incentive salience. In daily life, the smell of food may make you suddenly feel hungry, when you hadn’t felt that way a minute before. In animal neuroscience experiments, a CS for reward may trigger a more frenzied pulse of increased instrumental efforts to obtain that associated UCS reward in situations that purify the measurement of incentive salience, such as in Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) experiments&amp;nbsp;... Similarly, including a CS can often spur increased consumption of a reward UCS by rats or people, compared to consumption of the same UCS when CSs are absent&amp;nbsp;... Thus Pavlovian cues can elicit pulses of increased motivation to consume their UCS reward, whetting and intensifying the appetite. However, the motivation power is never simply in the cues themselves or their associations, since cue-triggered motivation can be easily modulated and reversed by drugs, hungers, satieties, etc., as discussed below.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical experiment, a rat is presented with sound-food pairings (classical conditioning).  Separately, the rat learns to press a lever to get food (operant conditioning). Test sessions now show that the rat presses the lever faster in the presence of the sound than in silence, although the sound has never been associated with lever pressing.

Pavlovian-instrumental transfer is suggested to play a role in the [[differential outcomes effect]], a procedure which enhances operant discrimination by pairing stimuli with specific outcomes.

==In popular culture==

In the 1932 novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]], conditioning plays a key role in the maintenance of social peace, especially in maintaining the [[caste system]] upon which society is based. Another example is in [[Anthony Burgess]]' 1962 dystopian novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' in which the novel's [[anti-hero]] and [[protagonist]], Alex, undergoes a procedure called the [[Ludovico technique]], where he is fed a solution to cause severe nausea and then forced to watch violent acts. This renders him unable to perform any violent acts without inducing similar nausea. Unintentionally, he also forms an aversion to classical music.

Some general examples that involve the classical conditioning theory in action include, in a lot of cases, advertising. This is a tactic used in order to elicit a response. Advertising on game shows is one of many examples. With the exciting and positive environment of a game show, the viewer may then start to generate an exciting response to the advertisement because of the association with the environment. Another example, very similar to Pavlov's experiment, involves food. Every time a person goes into the kitchen, they begin to feel hungry. This can also relate to eating certain foods while watching a scary movie turning into associating terror with the food that was being consumed at the times of watching the movie. Any type of music, such as Christmas music, that triggers certain sweet memories are related to classical conditioning as well.

The remorseful person is said to be ''contrite''.

A central concept in much of [[Christianity]], contrition is regarded as the first step, through [[Christ]], towards reconciliation with [[God in Christianity|God]]. It consists of repentance for all one's sins, a desire for God over sin, and faith in Christ's [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]] on the cross and its sufficiency for salvation (see [[regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] and ''[[ordo salutis]]''). It is widely referred to throughout the [[Bible]], e.g. Ezekiel 33:11, Psalms 6:7ff, Psalm 51:1–12, Luke 13:5, Luke 18:9–13, and the well-known [[Parable of the Prodigal Son|parable of the prodigal son]] (Luke 15:11–32).

== In the Catholic Church ==

=== Nature ===
The [[Council of Trent]] defined contrition as "sorrow of soul, and a hatred of sin committed, with a firm purpose of not sinning in the future". It is also known as ''animi cruciatus'' (affliction of spirit) and ''compunctio cordis'' (repentance of heart).

The word "contrition" implies a breaking of something that has become hardened. St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his [[Commentary on the Master of the Sentences]] thus explains its peculiar use: "Since it is requisite for the remission of sin that a man cast away entirely the liking for sin which implies a sort of continuity and solidity in his mind, the act which obtains forgiveness is termed by a figure of speech 'contrition'."&lt;ref name="Hanna 1908"&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Contrition|first=Edward Joseph |last=Hanna|authorlink=Edward Joseph Hanna|accessdate=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sorrow of soul is not merely speculative sorrow for wrong done, remorse of conscience, or a resolve to amend; it is a real pain and bitterness of soul together with a hatred and horror for sin committed; and this hatred for sin leads to the resolve to sin no more. The early Christian writers in speaking of the nature of contrition sometimes insist on the feeling of sorrow, sometimes on the detestation of the wrong committed. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] includes both when writing: "Compunctus corde non solet dici nisi stimulus peccatorum in dolore pœnitendi".&lt;ref name="Hanna 1908"/&gt;

Nearly all the medieval theologians hold that contrition is based principally on the detestation of sin. This detestation presupposes a knowledge of the heinousness of sin, and this knowledge begets sorrow and pain of soul. "A sin is committed by the consent, so it is blotted out by the dissent of the rational will; hence contrition is essentially sorrow. But it should be noted that sorrow has a twofold signification—dissent of the will and the consequent feeling; the former is of the essence of contrition, the latter is its effect."&lt;ref name="Hanna 1908"/&gt;

=== Necessity ===
The formal doctrine of the Church, announced through the Council of Trent, declares that contrition has always been necessary to obtain pardon of one's sins. Contrition is the first and indispensable condition for pardon. While it is possible for one to receive pardon where confession is impossible, there is no case where sin can be pardoned without contrition.&lt;ref name="Luche 1898"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5RY9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA527&amp;lpg=PA527&amp;dq=Contrition,+necessity+of&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jsJl13NJ4n&amp;sig=rIz2OGKjSt9ZuqUeFC3hQ11GoWc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjw15W8qLLOAhUI34MKHaM1AckQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Contrition%2C%20necessity%20of&amp;f=false Abbé Luche. ''The Catechism of Rodez: Explained in Form of Sermons'', B. Herder, 1898]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', Catholic writers have always insisted that such necessity arises (a) from the very nature of repentance as well as (b) from the positive command of God. From the very nature of repentance, they point out that the sentence of Christ in Luke 13:5, is final: "Except you [[repent]]", etc., and from the Fathers they cite passages such as the following from [[Cyprian]], ''De Lapsis'', no. 32: "Do penance in full, give proof of the sorrow that comes from a grieving and lamenting soul ... they who do away with repentance for sin, close the door to satisfaction." Scholastic doctors laid down the satisfaction' principle, "No one can begin a new life who does not repent him of the old" ([[Bonaventure]], In Lib. Sent. IV, dist. xvi, Pt. II, art. 1, Q. ii, also ex professo, ibid., Pt. I, art. I, Q. iii), and when asked the reason why, they point out the absolute incongruity of turning to God and clinging to sin, which is hostile to God's law. The Council of Trent, mindful of the tradition of the ages, defined (Sess. XlV. ch. iv de Contritione) that "contrition has always been necessary for obtaining forgiveness of sin". The positive command of God is also clear in the premises. The [[John the Baptist|Baptist]] sounded the note of preparation for the coming of the [[Messiah]]: "Make straight his paths"; and, as a consequence "they went out to him and were baptized confessing their sins". The first preaching of [[Jesus]] is described in the words: "Do penance, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand"; and the [[Twelve apostles|Apostles]], in their first [[sermon]]s to the people, warn them to "do penance and be baptized for the remission of their sins" ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 2:38). The Fathers followed up with like exhortation ([[First Epistle of Clement|Clement]] in P.G., I, 341; [[Hermas]] iii P.G., II, 894; [[Tertullian]] in P.L., II).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://ivww.newadvent.org/cathen/04337a.htm |chapter=Contrition |last=Hanna |first=Edward |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |volume=4 |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |year=1908 |others=Retrieved from New Advent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfect and imperfect contrition===
If detestation of sin arises from the love of God, who has been grievously offended, then contrition is termed "perfect"; if it arise from any other motive, such as loss of heaven, fear of hell, or the heinousness of guilt, then it is termed "imperfect contrition", or attrition.&lt;ref name="Hanna 1907"&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Attrition|first=Edward Joseph |last=Hanna|authorlink=Edward Joseph Hanna|accessdate=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Attrition|volume=2|page=887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Perfect contrition ====
Perfect contrition (also called contrition of charity), is a repentance for [[sin]] that is motivated by faith and the love of God.&lt;ref name="CCC 2012"&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|author=Catholic Church|edition=2|publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|location=Vatican City|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1452}} It contrasts with imperfect contrition, which arises from a less pure motive, such as common decency, or fear of [[Hell]].&lt;ref name="CCC 2012" /&gt;{{rp|1453}} The two types of contrition are distinguished by a person's motive for repentance, rather than the intensity of ones feelings or emotions. It is possible for perfect and imperfect contrition to be experienced simultaneously.

In perfect contrition its motive is founded on God's own goodness and not merely his goodness to the sinner or to humanity. There is no way of knowing with an absolute certainty if one has made an act of perfect contrition, but all that is required is the standard of all human action, moral certainty. If one says an act of contrition truthfully, intending it, then one would likely have moral certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/vexperts/showmessage_print.asp?number=370862|title=Perfect Contrition|publisher=EWTN|last1=Donovan, STL|first1=Colin B.|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perfect contrition removes the guilt and eternal punishment due to [[mortal sin]], even before the sinner has received [[absolution]] in the [[Confession (religion)|sacrament of penance]], provided that the person has a firm resolution to have recourse to sacramental confession as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=Penance&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_cti_1982_riconciliazione-penitenza_en.html|title=Penance And Reconciliation|publisher=International Theological Commission|ref=C.4|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this theological precept is demonstrated in the ''[[Code of Canon Law]]'' in canon 916, which states: "A person who is conscious of grave sin is not to celebrate Mass or receive the body of the Lord without previous sacramental confession unless there is a grave reason and there is no opportunity to confess; in this case the person is to remember the obligation to make an act of perfect contrition which includes the resolution of confessing as soon as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Code of Canon Law|edition=1984|location=Canon 916|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of imminent death, in which sacramental confession may not be possible, the firm resolution to go to sacramental confession, as soon as possible if a person survives, also removes the guilt and eternal punishment due to [[mortal sin]].&lt;ref name=Penance/&gt;

==== Imperfect contrition ====
{{Wikisource1911Enc|Attrition}}
According to Psalm 111: 10, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." In Philippians 2:12, Paul exhorts Christians to work out "our salvation in fear and trembling". In contrast to perfect contrition, imperfect contrition (also known as ''attrition'') is a desire not to [[sin]] for a reason other than love of [[God]].&lt;ref name="CCC 2012" /&gt;{{rp|1492}} While attrition does not produce [[Justification (theology)|justification]], attrition ''does dispose'' the soul to receive [[Divine grace|grace]] in the Catholic [[Sacrament]] of [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Reconciliation]].&lt;ref name="CCC 2012" /&gt;{{rp|1453}}

The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563) held that while imperfect contrition is motivated by reasons such as "the consideration of the turpitude of sin or from the fear of [[Hell]] and punishment", it also is a gift from God. "If any man assert that attrition ... is not a true and a profitable sorrow; that it does not prepare the soul for grace, but that it makes a man a hypocrite, yea, even a greater sinner, let him be [[Anathema]]."&lt;ref name="Hanna 1907"/&gt;

The question has also been asked apropos of attrition when one receives a sacrament in mortal sin, of which sin he is not then aware, will attrition with the sacrament suffice unto justification? The answer is generally given in the affirmative.&lt;ref name="Hanna 1907"/&gt;

Scriptural support for attrition can be found in [https://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+13%3A13&amp;version=DRA Proverbs 13:13], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2014:26-27&amp;version=DRA Proverbs 14:26–27], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+19%3A23&amp;version=DRA Proverbs 19:23], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10%3A28&amp;version=DRA Matthew 10:28], and [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2%3A12&amp;version=DRA Philippians 2:12].

=== Qualities ===
In accord with Catholic tradition, contrition, whether perfect or imperfect, must be interior, supernatural, universal, and sovereign.&lt;ref name="Hanna 1907"/&gt;

==== Interior ====
Contrition must be real and sincere sorrow of heart.&lt;ref name="Hanna 1908"/&gt;

==== Supernatural ====
In accordance with Catholic teaching contrition ought to be prompted by God's grace and aroused by motives which spring from faith, as opposed to merely natural motives, such as loss of [[honour]], fortune, and the like (Chemnitz, Exam. Concil. Trid., Pt. II, De Poenit.). In the Old Testament it is God who gives a "new heart" and who puts a "new spirit)" into the children of Israel (Ezech. 36:25–29); and for a clean heart the Psalmist prays in the Miserere (Ps. 1, 11 sqq.). Peter told those to whom he preached in the first days after [[Pentecost]] that God the Father had raised up Christ "to give repentance to Israel" (Acts, v, 30 sq.). [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], in advising [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], insists on dealing gently and kindly with those who resist the truth, "if peradventure God may give them full repentance" ([[Second Epistle to Timothy|2 Timothy]], 2:24–25). In the days of the [[Pelagian]] heresy [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] insisted on the supernaturalness of contrition, when he writes, "That we turn away from God is our doing, and this is the bad will; but to turn back to God we are unable unless He arouse and help us, and this is the good will." Some of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] doctors, notably [[John Duns Scotus|Scotus]], [[Cajetan]], and after them [[Francisco Suárez|Suarez]] (De Poenit., Disp. iii, sect. vi), asked speculatively whether man if left to himself could elicit a true act of contrition, but no theologian ever taught that makes for forgiveness of sin in the present economy of God could be inspired by merely natural motives. On the contrary, all the doctors have insisted on the absolute necessity of grace for contrition that disposes to forgiveness (Bonaventure, In Lib. Sent. IV, dist. xiv, Part I, art. II, Q. iii; also dist. xvii, Part I, art. I, Q. iii; cf.  Thomas, In Lib. Sent. IV). In keeping with this teaching of the Scriptures and the doctors, the Council of Trent defined; "If anyone say that without the inspiration of the [[Holy Spirit]] and without His aid a man can repent in the way that is necessary for obtaining the grace of justification, let him be [[anathema]]."

==== Universal ====
True contrition must extend to, at the very least, all mortal sins committed, and not just a select convenient few.&lt;ref name="Luche 1898"/&gt; This doctrine is intimately bound up with the Catholic teaching concerning grace and repentance. There is no forgiveness without sorrow of soul, and forgiveness is always accompanied by God's grace; grace cannot coexist with sin; and, as a consequence, one sin cannot be forgiven while another remains for which there is no repentance.

The prophet Joel urged men to turn to God with their whole heart (Joel 2:12–19). and Christ tells the doctor of the law that we must love God with our whole mind, our whole strength (Luke 10:27). Ezekiel insists that a man must "turn from his evil ways" if he wish to live (Ezekiel 33:11).

The Scholastics inquired into this question when they asked whether or not there must be a special act of contrition for every serious sin, and whether, in order to be forgiven, one must remember at the moment all grievous transgressions. To both questions they answered in the negative, judging that an act of [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]] which implicitly included all his sins would be sufficient.

==== Sovereign ====
According to Mark 8:35–37, Jesus admonished his disciples: "For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel, shall save it. For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his [[Soul in the Bible|soul]]?" Contrition for sin must take precedence over temporal concerns. When the envoys of the Empress [[Aelia Eudoxia|Eudoxia]] threatened [[John Chrysostom]], he responded, "Go tell the princess that Chrysostom fears only one thing, and that is sin."&lt;ref name="Luche 1898"/&gt;

=== Sacrament of Penance ===
{{See also|Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation}}

Contrition is not only a moral virtue, but the Council of Trent defined that it is a "part", nay more, quasi materia, in the Sacrament of Penance. "The (quasi) matter of this sacrament consists of the acts of the penitent himself, namely, contrition, confession, and satisfaction. These, inasmuch as they are by God's institution required in the penitent for the integrity of the sacrament and for the full and perfect remission of sin, are for this reason called parts of penance. "In consequence of this decree of Trent theologians teach that sorrow for sin must be in some sense sacramental. [[La Croix]] went so far as to say that sorrow must be aroused with a view of going to confession, but this seems to be asking too much; most theologians think with Schieler-Heuser (Theory and Practice of Confession, p. 113) that it is sufficient if the sorrow coexist in any way with the confession and is referred to it. Hence the precept of the Roman [[Ritual]], "After the confessor has heard the confession he should try by earnest exhortation to move the penitent to contrition" (Schieler-Heuser, op. cit., p.&amp;nbsp;111 sqq.).

==== Perfect contrition without the Sacrament of Penance ====

Regarding that contrition which has for its motive the love of God, the Council of Trent declares: "The Council further teaches that, though contrition may sometimes be made perfect by [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] and may reconcile men to God before the actual reception of this [[sacrament]], still the reconciliation is not to be ascribed to the contrition apart from the desire for the sacrament which it includes." The following proposition (no. 32) taken from [[Michel Baius|Baius]] was condemned by [[Gregory XIII]]: "That charity which is the fullness of the law is not always conjoined with forgiveness of sins." Perfect contrition, with the desire of receiving the Sacrament of Penance, restores the sinner to grace at once. This is certainly the teaching of the Scholastic doctors (Peter Lombard in P.L., CXCII, 885; St. Thomas, In Lib. Sent. IV, ibid.; St. Bonaventure, In Lib. Sent. IV, ibid.). This doctrine they derived from Holy Writ. Scripture certainly ascribes to charity and the love of God the power to take away sin: "He that loveth me shall be loved by My Father"; "Many sins are forgiven her because she hath loved much" (Luke 7:36-50).

Since the act of perfect contrition implies necessarily this same love of God, theologians have ascribed to perfect contrition what Scripture teaches belongs to charity. Nor is this strange, for in the [[Old Covenant]] there was some way of recovering God's grace once man had sinned. God wills not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live (Ezech. 33:11). This total turning to God corresponds to our idea of perfect contrition; and if under the Old Law love sufficed for the pardon of the sinner, surely the coming of Christ and the institution of the Sacrament of Penance cannot be supposed to have increased the difficulty of obtaining forgiveness. That the earlier Fathers taught the efficacy of sorrow for the remission of sins is very clear ([[First Epistle of Clement|Clement]] in P.G., I, 341 sqq.; and Hermas in P.G., II, 894 sqq.; Chrysostom in P.G., XLIX, 285 sqq.) and this is particularly noticeable in all the commentaries on Luke, vii, 47.

The [[Venerable Bede]] writes (P.L., XCII, 425): "What is love but fire; what is sin but rust? Hence it is said, many sins are forgiven her because she hath loved much, as though to say, she hath burned away entirely the rust of sin, because she is inflamed with the fire of love." Theologians have inquired with much learning as to the kind of love that justifies with the Sacrament of Penance. All are agreed that pure, or disinterested, love (amor benevolentiæ, amor amicitiæ) suffices; when there is question of interested, or selfish, love (amor concupiscentia) theologians hold that purely selfish love is not sufficient. When on furthermore asks what must be the formal motive in perfect love, there seems to be no real unanimity among the doctors. Some say that where there is perfect love God is loved for His great goodness alone; other, basing their contention on Scripture, think that the love of gratitude (amor gratitudinis) is quite sufficient, because God's benevolence and love towards men are intimately united, nay, inseparable from His Divine perfections ([[Hurter]], ''Theol. Dog.'', Thesis ccxlv, Scholion iii, no 3; [[Schieler-Heuser]], op. cit., pp.&amp;nbsp;77 sq.).

=== Obligation of eliciting the act of contrition ===
In the very nature of things the sinner must repent before he can be reconciled with God (Sess. XIV, ch. iv, de Contritione, Fuit quovis tempore, etc.). Therefore, he who has fallen into grievous sin must either make an act of perfect contrition or supplement the imperfect contrition by receiving the Sacrament of Penance; otherwise reconciliation with God is impossible. This obligation urges under pain of sin when there is danger of death. In danger of death, therefore, if a priest be not at hand to administer the sacrament, the sinner must make an effort to elicit an act of perfect contrition. The obligation of perfect contrition is also urgent whensoever one has to exercise some act for which a state of grace is necessary and the Sacrament of Penance is not accessible. Theologians have questions how long a man may remain in the state of sin, without making an effort to elicit an act of perfect contrition. They seem agreed that such neglect must have extended over considerable time, but what constitutes a considerable time they find it hard to determine (Schieler-Hauser, op. cit., pp.&amp;nbsp;83 sqq.). Probably the rule of [[St. Alphonsus Liguori]] will aid the solution: "The duty of making an act of contrition is urgent when one is obliged to make an act of love" (Sabetti, ''Theologia Moralis: de necess. contritionis'', no. 731; [[Ballerine]], ''Opus Morale: de contritione'').

== In other Christian theology ==
{{Expand section|This article does not substantively deal with non-Catholic thought on contrition; Sections on Eastern Orthodox, Protestant, LDS, etc. views should be written.|date=May 2016|small=no}}

The ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'', the primary confession of faith of the Lutheran Church, divides repentance into two parts: "One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the [[Law and Gospel#The Book of Concord|knowledge of sin]]; the other is faith, which is born of the Gospel, or of [[Absolution#Lutheran Church|absolution]], and believes that for Christ's sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article12 Augsburg Confession, Article XII: Of Repentance]&lt;/ref&gt;

Puritan preacher [[Thomas Hooker]] defined contrition as: "...nothing else, namely, when the sinner when a sinner by the sight of sin and vileness of it, and the punishment due to the same, is made sensible of sin, and is made to hate it, and hath his heart separated from the same..."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6QQDAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=contrition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJlYrD6LDOAhVm64MKHWpuB7cQ6AEIPjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=contrition&amp;f=false Hooker, Thomas. ''The soules preparation for Christ: a treatise of contrition'', 1638]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglo-Catholic rector of [[St. Mark's Episcopal Church (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|St. Mark's Church]] in Philadelphia, Alfred Garnett Mortimer, pointed out that "feelings" are not an adequate gauge of contrition. The signs of true contrition are a readiness to confess, a readiness to amend one's life and avoid temptation, and a readiness to forgive those others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=D-orAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=Contrition,+conditions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Uh-objdlgw&amp;sig=fPtIZAGTzQn8N4qyXkcOl4RfKqU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim24CqgbHOAhXGRSYKHQR1BVwQ6AEIUTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Contrition%2C%20conditions&amp;f=false Mortimer, Alfred Garnett.

[[File:Daniel Pešta (2017).jpg|thumb|Daniel Pešta, 2017]]
'''Daniel Pešta''' (born 1 May 1959) is a Czech [[multimedia artist]].

== Biography ==
Pešta was born into the family of architect Antonín Pešta and psychologist Helena Montanelli-Peštová. After completing secondary school of civil engineering, he studied at the Václav Hollar College of Art in [[Prague]]. During the communist era, Pešta became a part of the country's alternative culture scene and later earned a living as a graphic designer. After 2000, he finally left behind applied art and book illustrations and started to work exclusively with painting, from which he expanded into other forms of artistic expression. He spent two study trips in [[New York City|New York]] – one in 1998 and one in 2000.

Pešta has exhibited independently since 1992, and has participated in group exhibitions since 2000. Some of his most important projects include ''I was born in your bed'', held at the [[Venice Biennale|55th Venice Biennale]] in 2013 and ''Personal Structures (Nocturnal Head Records)'', held at the Palazzo Bembo on the occasion of 56th Venice Biennale in 2015 and in Palazzo Mora in 2017. In 2017 he was awarded the 2nd price in painting at London Art Biennale.

He is married to [[Dadja Altenburg-Kohl]]. His daughter Karolína Peštová-Matoušová studied art theory at Charles University in Prague.

== Work ==
Already in his youth, Pešta acquired an artistic dexterity and sense for material that he first applied in [[hyperrealism (visual arts)|hyperrealistic painting]]. Nevertheless, he soon abandoned this approach in favor of a raw, expressive style more closely reflecting his nature. In 1998, Pešta went on his first study trip to [[New York City|New York]]. This contact with the international art scene radically influenced his work. He started to make use of diverse materials, experimenting with wax, leather, textiles, or recycled photographs as part of naturalistic [[assemblage (art)|assemblages]]. Since 2004, his favorite technique has been clear epoxy resin, which he uses to cover older paintings and objects, thus conserving and devaluating them all at once.
Over time, he expanded his range of artistic approaches to include [[installation art|object installations]], [[video art]], and purely [[conceptual art|conceptual]] endeavors.

In his alarming conceptual project ''I was born in your bed'' (2013) – an exploration of [[Romani people|Roma]] issues (i.e., how an individual's fate is predetermined by race) – Pešta sounds a warning bell. The accompanying video art projects in particular contributed to broad public discourse on the issue. 

In his series ''Genetic Codes'', which explores the predestination of fate or analyses human subconsciousness. A mask is another of Pešta's central motifs. He sees it as a symbol of pretense and anonymity, and also of being obsessed with one's own uniqueness and power. 

In terms of subject matter, Pešta's works touch on the mysteries of human existence, the fragile nature of intimacy, and the role of man within society. His art often has a social or political subtext.

== Early life and education==
Hickton was born on August 14, 1955 in [[Columbus, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lawyercentral.com/david-j-hickton-interactive-profile--20-563329.html Lawyer Central.com profile]&lt;/ref&gt; He received his undergraduate degree from Pennsylvania State University and his [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Law]],&lt;ref name="UTimes" /&gt; where he met his wife [[Dawne Hickton|Dawne Eileen Sepanski Hickton]].&lt;ref name="Tribune-Review"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/5152245-74/hickton-law-david|title=Pitt law clinic to help low-income seniors endowed by $1 million grant|last=Tribune-Review|website=TribLIVE.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
Hickton began his legal career as a law clerk for U.S. District Judge [[Gustave Diamond]] from 1981 to 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2009/10/27/Hickton-believed-to-be-frontrunner-for-U-S-attorney/stories/200910270268|title=Hickton believed to be frontrunner for U.S. attorney|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For eleven years, Hickton was an adjunct professor at the [[Duquesne University School of Law]], where he taught a course on [[competition law|antitrust law]]. He served on the Board of Trustees at [[Penn State University]] from 1977-1980.

He was nominated as [[United States Attorney]] for Western Pennsylvania by President [[Barack Obama]] on May 3, 2010, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 5, 2010.

In May, 2014, Hickton's office brought an indictment against five members of the [[Chinese People's Liberation Army]], alleging economic espionage. The defendants were charged with hacking into American entities to steal trade secrets and other information that would be useful to Chinese competitors. Victims included [[Westinghouse Electric Company]], the [[U.S. Steel]], [[Alcoa]], Inc., and [[Allegheny Technologies]].&lt;ref name="Allegheny Technologies" /&gt; His office also indicted Russian hacker [[Evgeniy Bogachev]], one of the world's leading cyber criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Pittsburgh Officials Indict International Cyber-Criminal"|url=http://wesa.fm/post/pittsburgh-officials-indict-international-cyber-criminal#stream/0|accessdate=24 April 2017|agency=WESA-FM|publisher=Liz Reid|date=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, his office, in cooperation with the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and legal authorities in 19 other countries, shut down [[Dark0de]], a [[Computer crime|cybercrime]] [[Crime forum|forum]] and [[black market]]place for [[security hacker]]s. Darkode offered [[malware]] to disrupt operations in computer systems in several countries, and offered stolen data ranging from U.S. [[Social Security number]]s to passwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/major-computer-hacking-forum-shut-down-by-20-countries-us-announces/2015/07/15/dd4cf514-2b05-11e5-a5ea-cf74396e59ec_story.html|title="Major computer hacking forum shut down by 20 countries, U.S. announces"|date=July 15, 2015|publisher=Ellen Nakashima|agency=The Washington Post|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Hickton and his office brought forth a 21 count indictment of conspiracy, [[money laundering]], [[wire fraud]], and [[identity theft]] against Cuban national Yoandy Perez Llanes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdpa/pr/alleged-upmc-hack-co-conspirator-extradited-us|title=Alleged UPMC Hack Co-conspirator Extradited to U.S.|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2016, Mr. Llanes was extradited from Venezuela to the U.S., and later in 2017, Llanes and a cohort Soler Nodarse&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/947101/venezuelan-sentenced-for-2-2m-tax-fraud-with-hacked-info|title=Venezuelan Sentenced For $2.2M Tax Fraud With Hacked Info - Law360|website=www.law360.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, plead guilty for their part in a $2.2 million scheme where hackers stole an estimated 62,000 tax forms of [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center|UPMC]] employees and sold them on the dark web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2017/04/17/Cuban-Yoandy-Llanes-pleads-guilty-stolen-UPMC-IDs-tax-refunds/stories/201704170110|title=Cuban national pleads guilty in tax scam that used stolen UPMC IDs|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=2017-08-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania, Hickton was named to co-chair a national Heroin Task Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Federal prosecutor to co-chair national Heroin Task Force"|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/17/federal-prosecutor-to-co-chair-national-heroin-tas/|accessdate=24 April 2017|agency=Associated Press, Joe Mandak|publisher=New Pittsburgh Courier|date=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he formed the U.S. Attorney's Working Group on Addiction: Prevention, Intervention, Treatment, and Recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Regional task force on drug addiction nears final report"|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2014/08/15/Regional-task-force-on-drug-addiction-nears-final-report/stories/201408150030.print|accessdate=24 April 2017|agency=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|publisher=Rich Lord|date=August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="dangers of opioids" /&gt; His office worked with the University of Pittsburgh to post information online about lethal batches of heroin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="U.S. Attorney, Pitt working to prevent ODs by posting heroin info online"|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2014/08/15/Regional-task-force-on-drug-addiction-nears-final-report/stories/201408150030.print|accessdate=24 April 2017|agency=Pittsburgh Tribune Review|issue=February 3, 2016|publisher=Brian Bowling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Hickton assembled a Community Police Working Group to help build trust between members of law enforcement and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David J. Hickton|url=http://www.law.pitt.edu/people/david-j-hickton|website=PittLaw|publisher=University of Pittsburgh School of Law|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group held community-based meetings, developed a Crisis Team, and distributed thousands of surveys to elicit community feedback about community-police relations and safety. In 2015, Pittsburgh was selected by Attorney General [[Loretta Lynch]] as one of six pilot cities for the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=Emma|title="U.S. Attorney General Addresses Pittsburgh's Community-Police Relationships"|url=http://wesa.fm/post/us-attorney-general-addresses-pittsburgh-s-community-police-relationships#stream/0|accessdate=26 April 2017|publisher=WESA-FM|date=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a three-year investigation, Hickton secured fundamental changes in the [[Pennsylvania Department of Corrections]] (PDOC) to humanely address the issues of unconstitutional confinement conditions for those suffering from serious mental illness and for victims of institutional sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tricountysentry.com/blog/justice-department-closes-investigation-against-pennsylvania-department-of-corrections/|title=Justice Department Closes Investigation Against Pennsylvania Department of Corrections|work=Tri County Sentry – The Tri-County's Only Muliticultural Newspaper|access-date=2017-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also initiated a case study in police-community reconciliation in the neighborhood of Homewood.&lt;ref name="Lord2013" /&gt;

In 2015, Hickton led an investigation of [[Education Management Corporation]] (EDMC), which resulted in the recovery of $95.5 million, the largest [[False Claims Act]] (FCA) recovery of Department of Education funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2015/11/16/EDMC-reaches-nearly-100-million-settlement-with-federal-state-prosecutors-over-recruiting-practices/stories/201511170011|title=EDMC reaches nearly $100 million settlement with prosecutors over recruiting|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David R. Roediger''' (born July 13, 1952) is the Foundation Distinguished Professor of American Studies and History at the [[University of Kansas]], where he has been since the fall of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roediger|first1=David|title=CV|url=https://history.ku.edu/sites/history.ku.edu/files/docs/cv/david_roediger_cv_2015-01.pdf|website=history.ku.edu|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, he was an American Kendrick C. Babcock Professor of History at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (UIUC).  His research interests include the construction of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial identity]], [[social class|class structures]], labor studies, and the history of [[Far left|American radicalism]]. He writes from a [[Marxism|Marxist]] theoretical framework.

==Early life and education==
Roediger was born on July 13, 1952 in [[Columbia, Illinois]]. He attended local public schools through high school. He earned a [[bachelor of science]] degree in education from [[Northern Illinois University]] in 1975. He went on to do graduate study and earned a [[doctor of philosophy|PhD]] in history from [[Northwestern University]] in 1980, where he wrote a dissertation under the direction of [[George M. Fredrickson]].

==Academic career==
He was assistant editor of the [[Frederick Douglass]] Papers at [[Yale University]] from 1979 to 1980.

After receiving his doctorate, Roediger was a lecturer and assistant professor of history at [[Northwestern University]] from 1980 to 1985. He served as an assistant professor at the [[University of Missouri]] in 1985, rising to full professor in 1992.  He moved to the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1995, and was chair of the university's American Studies Program from 1996 to 2000.

In 2000, he was appointed professor of history at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. Roediger has also served as the director for the Center on Democracy in a Multiracial Society at UIUC. Beginning in the fall of 2014, he will be the Foundation Distinguished Professor of American Studies and History at [[Kansas University]].  
Roediger is a member of the board of directors of the [[Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company|Charles H Kerr Company Publishers]], a position he has held since 1992.

==Research==
Roediger's research interests primarily concern race and class in the [[United States]], although he has also written on radicalism in American history and politics.

In 1989, Roediger and historian [[Philip Foner]] co-authored ''Our Own Time: A History of American Labor and the Working Day,'' a book that provides a highly detailed account of the movement to shorten the [[working time|working day]] in the United States. The work broke new ground by combining [[Labor history of the United States|labor history]] with a study of culture and the nature of work. The book also extended the history of the [[eight-hour day]] movement to [[Colonial America|colonial times]]. The authors argued that debate over the length of the work-day or work-week has been the central issue of the American labor movement during periods of high growth.

===The Wages of Whiteness===
{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
Roediger's book, ''[[The Wages of Whiteness]]: Race and the Making of the American Working Class'', was published in 1991. Along with Alexander Saxton's ''Rise and Fall of the White Republic''(1990) and [[Toni Morrison]]'s ''Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination'' (1992), this work is often cited as the starting point of contemporary [[whiteness studies]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

[[Theodore W. Allen]]'s [http://clogic.eserver.org/2006/allen.html “Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race"] (1975),&lt;ref&gt;Theodore W. Allen, https://www.jstor.org/stable/3004507 [http://clogic.eserver.org/2006/allen.html "Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race"] (Hoboken: Hoboken Education Project, 1975), republished in 2006 with an "Introduction" by Jeffrey B. Perry at Center for the Study of Working Class Life, SUNY, Stony Brook&lt;/ref&gt; a pamphlet that later was expanded into his seminal two-volume work [http://www.versobooks.com/books/1039-the-invention-of-the-white-race-volume-1 “The Invention of the White Race,” Vol. 1: “Racial Oppression and Social Control”] (1994, 2012) and &lt;ref&gt;Theodore W. Allen, [http://www.versobooks.com/books/1039-the-invention-of-the-white-race-volume-1 "The Invention of the White Race," Vol. 1: "Racial Oppression and Social Control"] (Verso Books, 1994, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.versobooks.com/books/1048-the-invention-of-the-white-race-volume-2 “The Invention of the White Race,” Vol. 2: “The Origin of Racial Oppression in Anglo-America”] (1997, 2012);&lt;ref&gt;Theodore W. Allen, [http://www.versobooks.com/books/1048-the-invention-of-the-white-race-volume-2 “The Invention of the White Race,” Vol. 2: “The Origin of Racial Oppression in Anglo-America”] (1997, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-84467-770-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; has also been influential in this field. The argument was also in some regards anticipated by [[Abram Lincoln Harris]]' radical scholarship in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, this argument from Harris: "An ill founded fear of seditious combination between outnumbering Negro slaves and landless whites led the dominant whites to foster and augment race distinctions just as many modern employers maintain a definite proportion of representatives of different races and nationalities as a bulwark against labor organization and as others, more ruthless, exploit race antip athy upon the theory of divide et impera” (472). https://www.jstor.org/stable/3004507 {{cite journal |  author-link = Abram L. Harris | title = Economic Foundations of American Race Division | journal = Social Forces | volume = 5(3) | pages = 468–478 | date = 1927 }} Also from Allen: “the opposition to slavery which emanated from the Northwest and the eastern wage-earners was caused by their recognition of a fundamental antagonism of interest between the slavery system and free labor rather than by their humanitarism. As a matter of fact the northern wage-earners were as hostile to Negro freemen as to the slaves. The mobbing of Negroes was quite a common occurrence in the northern and middlewestern cities during the pre-civil war period." [here, Allen cites Frederick Douglass, LIFE AND TIMES OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS, Part I, Ch. 20 and Part II, Ch. 5. Also THE NEW YORK RIOTS]” (472)&lt;/ref&gt; Allen later wrote of Roediger's work: &lt;blockquote&gt;"...because of its almost universal acceptance for use in colleges and universities, has served as the single most effective instrument in the socially necessary consciousness-raising function of objectifying "whiteness," and in popularizing the "race-as-a-social-construct" thesis. As one who has been the beneficiary of kind supportive comments from him for my own efforts in this field of historical investigation, I undertake this critical essay with no other purpose than furthering the our common aim of the disestablishment of white identity, and the overthrow of white supremacism in general."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore W. Allen, [http://clogic.eserver.org/4-2/allen.html "On Roediger’s Wages of Whiteness" (Revised Edition)"] ("Cultural Logic," 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the work, Roediger argued that "whiteness" is a historical phenomenon in the United States, as many different ethnicities now considered "[[white people|white]]" were not initially perceived as such here. The [[Irish people|Irish]], for example, as Roman Catholics and from rural areas, were not considered "white" - meaning accepted as members of the Anglo-American Protestant majority society - until they began to distinguish themselves from [[African American|black]] [[slave]]s and freedmen; from the [[New York Draft Riots]] of 1863, to riots in [[Philadelphia]] against black voting, and the [[Chicago Race Riot of 1919]], ethnic Irish were prominent in violent confrontations against black Americans, with whom they competed for jobs, physical territory and political power. Roediger believes their struggle reflects the emergence of the modern theory of [[Color Consciousness|color consciousness]], through which notions of "nations" and "races" were increasingly linked to color as the primary category of human difference. Roediger claims that the [[social construction]] of the concept of a white [[critical race theory|race]] in the United States was a conscious effort by slave owners to gain distance from those they enslaved, who were generally non-European and non-Christian. In addition, white working peoples gained distance from their Southern proletarian complements, the slaves. By the 18th century, he says, "white" had become well-established as a racial term in the United States; by the end of the 19th, it had become an all-encompassing one.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Weaving together economic theory, psychology, and the histories of immigration, industrialization, class formation and slavery, Roediger in this work addressed what has become a common question in labor history, specifically, and American political culture more generally: why, historically, have working class blacks and whites not found common cause in their shared suffering at the bottom of the social ladder?  ([[W.E.B. DuBois]] also posed this question in his seminal work, ''[[Black Reconstruction]]'' (1935), as he saw a failure of labor in creating connections across racial lines.) In the nineteenth-century context where the small-scale, autonomous craftsmen were being replaced, slowly but inexorably, by the factory system - with great consequences for the "liberty" of ordinary Americans, Roediger suggested that for workers to embrace "whiteness" and a caricatured representation of black slaves provided them with a meaningful symbolic "wage," replacing the status values of independence and craft skill for workers.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

This idea that "whiteness" has enormous surplus value for the working class has influenced a generation of scholars including, most recently, cultural critic [[Thomas Frank]]. Most immediately, it was considered by scholars to have contributed to what analysts had observed to be the splitting of the civil rights consensus of the national Democratic Party and the shift among many of the white working class to vote for Republican [[Ronald Reagan]] as president in 1980, pushing him to victory.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

''Wages of Whiteness'' won the Merle Curti Award in 1992 from the [[Organization of American Historians]], for the best work of social history in 1991.

'''Edward S. Miller''' was the Deputy Assistant Director of the Inspections Division under [[Mark Felt]] with the [[United States]] [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].

In November 1980, Miller, then head of the FBI's Domestic Intelligence Division, and Mark Felt were convicted after a seven-week federal jury trial of having "conspired to injure and oppress the citizens of the United States" and Miller was fined $3,500. While the convictions were being appealed in April 1981, President [[Ronald Reagan]] [[pardon]]ed both men. At the time of trial, Felt and Miller were the highest-ranking bureau employees to have been tried for a [[criminal offense]].&lt;ref name="nytpardon"&gt;Pear, Robert (April 16, 1981).

An '''emblem''' is an [[abstract art|abstract]] or representational pictorial [[image]] that represents a [[concept]], like a [[moral]] [[truth]], or an [[allegory]], or a person, like a king or [[saint]].&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Oxford English Dictionary (OED2) | place = United Kingdom | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1989 | url = http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/symbol | isbn = 0-19-861186-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emblems vs. symbols==
Although the words ''emblem'' and ''[[symbol]]'' are often used interchangeably, an emblem is a pattern that is used to represent an [[idea]] or an individual. An emblem crystallizes in concrete, visual terms some abstraction: a deity, a tribe or nation, or a virtue or vice.{{Clarify| reason=In which discipline is this distinction done? Is it an elementary notion in such field? As the previous sentence says (as everyone knows) emblem and symbols are interchangeable casually.| date=January 2013}}

An emblem may be worn or otherwise used as an identifying [[badge]] or [[Embroidered patch|patch]]. For example, in America, police officers' badges refer to their personal metal emblem whereas their woven emblems on uniforms identify members of a particular unit. A real or metal cockle shell, the emblem of [[St James the Great|St.&amp;nbsp;James the Apostle]], sewn onto the hat or clothes, identified a medieval pilgrim to his shrine at [[Santiago de Compostela]]. In the Middle Ages, many saints were given emblems, which served to identify them in paintings and other images: [[Catherine of Alexandria|St.&amp;nbsp;Catherine]] had a wheel, or a sword, [[St Anthony the Great|St.&amp;nbsp;Anthony Abbot]], a pig and a small bell. These are also called '''attributes''', especially when shown carried by or close to the saint in art. Kings and other grand persons increasingly adopted [[personal device]]s or emblems that were distinct from their family [[heraldry]]. The most famous include [[Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV of France]]'s sun, the [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamander]] of [[Francis&amp;nbsp;I of France]], the [[boar]] of [[Richard&amp;nbsp;III of England]] and the [[armillary sphere]] of [[Manuel&amp;nbsp;I of Portugal]].  In the fifteenth and sixteenth century, there was a fashion, started in Italy, for making large [[medal]]s with a portrait head on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] and the emblem on the reverse; these would be given to friends and as [[diplomatic gift]]s. [[Pisanello]] produced many of the earliest and finest of these.

A symbol, on the other hand, substitutes one thing for another, in a more concrete fashion:&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;
* The [[Christian cross]] is a symbol of the [[Crucifixion]]; it is an emblem of sacrifice.
* The [[Red Cross]] is one of three symbols representing the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Red Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/emblem-history |title=The History of the Emblems |accessdate=2009-05-29 |date=2006-03-14 }} History of the emblems of the International Red Cross: An account of this organisation's need to adopt an emblem to represent itself, and the factors which led to it eventually adopting a second (the red crescent) and third (the red crystal).&lt;/ref&gt; A red cross on a white background is the emblem of [[humanitarian spirit]].

==Other terminology==
A [[totem]] is specifically an animal emblem that expresses the spirit of a [[clan]]. [[Heraldry]] knows its emblems as [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]]s. The [[lion passant]] serves as the emblem of England, the [[lion rampant]] as the emblem of [[Scotland]].

An [[icon]] consists of an image (originally a religious image), that has become standardized by convention. A [[logo]] is an impersonal, secular icon, usually of a [[corporation|corporate entity]].

== Emblems in history ==
Since the 15th century the terms of emblem (''emblema''; from {{lang-el|ἔμβλημα}}, meaning "embossed ornament") and emblematura belong to the ''termini technici'' of [[architecture]]. They mean an [[icon]]ic painted, drawn, or sculptural representation of a concept affixed to houses and belong—like the inscriptions—to the architectural ornaments (ornamenta). Since the publication of 
''De Re Aedificatoria'' (1452, Ten Books of Architecture),[8] by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472), patterned after the ''De architectura'' by the Roman architect and engineer [[Vitruvius]], ''emblema'' are related to Egyptian hieroglyphics and are considered as being the lost universal language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Raybould | first = Robin | authorlink = Robin Raybould | title = An Introduction to the Symbolic Literature of the Renaissance | publisher = [[friedman Publishing]] | year = 2005 | pages = 170 | isbn = 9781412053112 | quote = {{ISBN|1-4120-5311-0}}}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, the emblems belong to the Renaissance knowledge of antiquity which comprises not only Greek and Roman antiquity but also Egyptian antiquity as proven by the numerous [[obelisk]]s built in 16th and 17th century Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/skull-and-crossboneshttp://www.romeartlover.it/Obelisks.html |title=Obelisks of Rome |accessdate=2009-05-29 |last=Piperno |first=Roberto |editor=Rosamie Moore}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}} Historical information, a map, photographs, and descriptions of Egyptian obelisks in Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1531 publication in Augsburg of the first [[emblem book]], the ''[[Emblemata]]'' of the Italian jurist [[Andrea Alciato]] launched a fascination with emblems that lasted two centuries and touched most of the countries of western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mun.ca/alciato/ |title=Alciato's Book of Emblems: The Memorial Web Edition in Latin and English |accessdate=2009-05-29 |last=Barker |first=William |author2=Mark Feltham |author3=Jean Guthrie |date=1995-10-26}} This page states that "Andrea Alciato's [Emblemata] had enormous influence and popularity in the 16th and 17th centuries".&lt;/ref&gt; "Emblem" in this sense refers to a didactic or moralizing combination of picture and text intended to draw the reader into a self-reflective examination of his or her own [[personal life|life]]. Complicated associations of emblems could transmit information to the culturally-informed viewer, a characteristic of the 16th-century artistic movement called [[Mannerism]].

A popular collection of emblems, which ran to many editions, was presented by [[Francis Quarles]] in 1635. Each of the emblems consisted of a paraphrase from a passage of Scripture, expressed in ornate and metaphorical language, followed by passages from the Christian Fathers, and concluding with an [[epigram]] of four lines. These were accompanied by an emblem that presented the symbols displayed in the accompanying passage.

== Emblems in speech ==
Emblems are certain gestures which have a specific meaning attached to them. These meanings usually are associated with the culture they are established in. Using emblems creates a way for humans to communicate with one another in a non-verbal way. An individual waving their hand at a friend, for example, would communicate "hello" without having to verbally say anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KaZYCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Nonverbal Communication|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|isbn=9780205525003|edition=1st|pages=432|last1=Burgoon, Guerrero, Floyd|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emblems vs. sign language ===
Although sign language uses hand gestures to communicate words in a non-verbal way, it should not be confused with emblems. Sign language contains linguistic properties, similar to those used in verbal languages, and is used to communicate entire conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Distinguishing the Processing of Gestures from Signs in Deaf Individuals: An fMRI Study|last1=Res|first1=Brain|pmc=2693477|pmid=19397900|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2009.04.034|volume=1276|journal=Brain Res|pages=140–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistic properties are verbs, nouns, pronouns, adverbs, adjectives, etc...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/7/1766.full.pdf|title=On the Universal Structure of Human Lexical Semantics|last1=Youn|first1=Hyejin|accessdate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with sign language, emblems are a non-linguistic form of communication. Emblems are single gestures which are meant to get a short non-verbal message to another individual.

== Emblems in culture ==
Emblems are associated with the culture they are established in and are subjective to that said culture. For example, the OK sign used in America to communicate "OK" in a non-verbal way, also means “O” in the state of France. The same OK sign means "money" in the country of Japan, and in some European countries the OK sign means something sexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwhZOxI11QMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Academic+Encounters+Level+4+Student%27s+Book+Reading+and+Writing:+Human+Behavior&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrlY6I4dnTAhVDKCYKHcldCtIQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Academic%20Encounters%20Level%204%20Student's%20Book%20Reading%20and%20Writing%3A%20Human%20Behavior&amp;f=false|title=Academic Encounters Level 4 Student's Book Reading and Writing: Human Behavior|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last1=Seal|first1=Bernard|accessdate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the thumbs up sign in America means "good job or good luck", but in some parts of the Middle East the thumbs up sign means something highly offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.busuu.com/what-hand-gestures-mean-in-different-countries/|title=What Hand Gestures Mean In Different Countries|website=Busuu Logo|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Empathy''' is the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from within their frame of reference, that is, the capacity to place oneself in another's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=392335 | title=The importance of empathy as an interviewing skill in medicine | author1=Bellet, Paul S. | author2=Michael J.

Types of empathy include cognitive empathy, emotional empathy, and [[Wiktionary:somatic#Etymology|somatic]] empathy.&lt;ref name="Rothschild, B. 2006"&gt;Rothschild, B. (with Rand, M. L.). (2006). ''Help for the Helper: The psychophysiology of compassion fatigue and vicarious trauma.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The English word ''empathy'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word εμπάθεια (''empatheia'', meaning "physical affection or passion"). This, in turn, comes from εν (''en'', "in, at") and πάθος (''[[pathos]]'', "passion" or "suffering").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2334198 Empatheia, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt; The term was adapted by [[Hermann Lotze]] and [[Robert Vischer]] to create the German word ''Einfühlung'' ("feeling into"), which was translated by [[Edward B. Titchener]] into the English term empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Titchener E.B. (1909/2014) [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-E14-01.pdf Introspection and empathy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726132552/http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-E14-01.pdf |date=July 26, 2014 }} Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences  2014; 7: 25–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| citeseerx=10.1.1.143.2396 | first = Vittorio | last = Gallese | year = 2003 | title = The Roots of Empathy: The Shared Manifold Hypothesis and the Neural Basis of Intersubjectivity | journal = Psychopathology | volume = 36 | pages = 171–180 | doi = 10.1159/000072786 | pmid=14504450 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in modern Greek, εμπάθεια means "malice", "hostility".

''[[Alexithymia]]'' is a word used to describe a deficiency in understanding, processing or describing emotions ''in oneself'' as opposed to in others.&lt;ref name="Bar-On"&gt;Bar-On, Reuven; Parker, James DA (2000). ''The Handbook of Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Development, Assessment, and Application at Home, School, and in the Workplace''. San Francisco, California: Jossey-Bass. {{ISBN|0-7879-4984-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This term comes from the combination of two Ancient Greek words: ἀλέξω (''alekso'', meaning "push away, repel, or protect") and ''θυμός'' (''thymos'', meaning "the soul, as the seat of emotion, feeling and thought"). Thus alexithymia literally means "pushing away your emotions".

== Definitions ==

Empathy definitions encompass a broad range of emotional states, including caring for other people and having a desire to help them; experiencing emotions that match another person's emotions; discerning what another person is thinking or feeling;&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G H M Pijnenborg, G.H.M. |author2=Spikman, J.M. |author3=Jeronimus, B.F. |author4=Aleman, A. |year=2012|title= Insight in schizophrenia: associations with empathy |journal= European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience|volume=263|issue=4|pages=299–307|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-012-0373-0|doi=10.1007/s00406-012-0373-0|pmid=23076736}}&lt;/ref&gt; and making less distinct the differences between the self and the other.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, S.D., &amp; Klein, K.J. (2001). Regulating the costs of empathy: the price of being human. ''Journal of Socio-Economics''.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be understood as having the separateness of defining oneself and another a blur.&lt;ref name="Decety, J" /&gt;

It also is the ability to feel and share another person's emotions. Some believe that empathy involves the ability to match another's emotions, while others believe that empathy involves being tenderhearted toward another person.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2011"&gt;Snyder, C. R., Shane J. Lopez, and Jennifer T. Pedrotti. Positive Psychology: The Scientific and Practical Explorations of Human Strengths. Second ed. Los Angeles: SAGE, 2011. 267–75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having empathy can include having the understanding that there are many factors that go into decision making and cognitive thought processes. Past experiences have an influence on the decision making of today. Understanding this allows a person to have empathy for individuals who sometimes make illogical decisions to a problem that most individuals would respond with an obvious response. Broken homes, childhood trauma, lack of parenting and many others factors can influence the connections in the brain which a person uses to make decisions in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dietrich|first1=Cindy|title=Decision Making: Factors that Influence Decision Making, Heuristics Used, and Decision Outcomes|url=https://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/180/decision-making-factors-that-influence-decision-making-heuristics-used-and-decision-outcomes?ab=hb|website=Inquiries Journal|publisher=Inquiries Journal/Student Pulse LLC|accessdate=6 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003124530/http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/180/decision-making-factors-that-influence-decision-making-heuristics-used-and-decision-outcomes?ab=hb|archivedate=October 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Hoffman]] is a psychologist who studied the development of empathy. According to Hoffman everyone is born with the capability of feeling empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roth-Hanania|first=Ronit|last2=Davidov|first2=Maayan|last3=Zahn-Waxler|first3=Carolyn|date=2011-06-01|title=Empathy development from 8 to 16 months: Early signs of concern for others|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638311000506|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|volume=34|issue=3|pages=447–458|doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2011.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compassion]] and [[sympathy]] are terms associated with empathy.  Definitions vary, contributing to the challenge of defining empathy. Compassion is often defined as an emotion we feel when others are in need, which motivates us to help them. Sympathy is a feeling of care and understanding for someone in need. Some include in sympathy an [[empathic concern]], a feeling of concern for another, in which some scholars include the wish to see them better off or happier.&lt;ref name="Batson, C.D. 2009 pp. 3"&gt;Batson, C.D. (2009). These things called empathy: Eight related but distinct phenomena. In J. Decety and W. Ickes (Eds.), The Social Neuroscience of Empathy (pp.&amp;nbsp;3–15). Cambridge: [[MIT Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Empathy is distinct also from [[pity]] and [[emotional contagion]].&lt;ref name="Batson, C.D. 2009 pp. 3"/&gt; Pity is feeling that another is in trouble and in need of help as they cannot fix their problems themselves, often described as "feeling sorry" for someone. Emotional contagion is when a person (especially an infant or a member of a [[crowd|mob]]) imitatively "catches" the emotions that others are showing without necessarily recognizing this is happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hatfield E. |author2=Cacioppo J. L. |author3=Rapson R. L. |year=1993 |title=Emotional contagion |url=http://www.elainehatfield.com/ch50.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=96–99 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770953 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119002643/http://www.elainehatfield.com/ch50.pdf |archivedate=November 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since empathy involves understanding the emotional states of other people, the way it is characterized is derived from the way emotions themselves are characterized. If, for example, emotions are taken to be centrally characterized by bodily feelings, then grasping the bodily feelings of another will be central to empathy. On the other hand, if emotions are more centrally characterized by a combination of beliefs and desires, then grasping these beliefs and desires will be more essential to empathy. The ability to imagine oneself as another person is a sophisticated imaginative process. However, the basic capacity to recognize emotions is probably innate&lt;ref name="Baird, James D., and Laurie Nadel, 2010"&gt;Happiness Genes: Unlock the Positive Potential Hidden in Your DNA, New Page Books (April, 2010) {{ISBN|978-1-60163-105-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be achieved unconsciously. Yet it can be trained&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = O'Malley W. J. | year = 1999 | title = Teaching Empathy | url = | journal = America | volume = 180 | issue = 12| pages = 22–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and achieved with various degrees of intensity or accuracy.

Empathy necessarily has a "more or less" quality. The paradigm case of an empathic interaction, however, involves a person communicating an accurate recognition of the significance of another person's ongoing intentional actions, associated emotional states, and personal characteristics in a manner that the recognized person can tolerate. Recognitions that are both accurate and tolerable are central features of empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwartz W | year = 2002 | title = From passivity to competence: A conceptualization of knowledge, skill, tolerance, and empathy | url = | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 338–345 | doi=10.1521/psyc.65.4.338.20239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwartz W | year = 2013 | title = The parameters of empathy: Core considerations for psychotherapy and supervision | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.2393689 | journal = Advances in Descriptive Psychology | volume = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human capacity to recognize the bodily feelings of another is related to one's imitative capacities, and seems to be grounded in an innate capacity to associate the bodily movements and facial expressions one sees in another with the [[proprioception|proprioceptive]] feelings of producing those corresponding movements or expressions oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Meltzoff A.N. |author2=Decety J. | year = 2003 | title = What imitation tells us about social cognition: A rapprochement between developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 358 | issue = 1431| pages = 491–500 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2002.1261 | pmid=12689375 | pmc=1351349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans seem to make the same immediate connection between the tone of voice and other vocal expressions and inner feeling.

In the field of positive psychology, empathy has also been compared with altruism and egotism. Altruism is behavior that is aimed at benefitting another person, while egotism is a behavior that is acted out for personal gain. Sometimes, when someone is feeling empathetic towards another person, acts of altruism occur. However, many question whether or not these acts of altruism are motivated by egotistical gains. According to positive psychologists, people can be adequately moved by their empathies to be [[altruistic]].&lt;ref name="Snyder, C.

== Classification and types of empathy ==

Empathy is generally divided into two major components:&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogers K, Dziobek I, Hassenstab J, Wolf OT, Convit A | date = Apr 2007 | title = Who cares?

Affective empathy can be subdivided into the following scales:&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983" /&gt;

* [[Empathic concern]]: sympathy and compassion for others in response to their suffering.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="response"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Minio-Paluello | first1 = Ilaria | last2 = Lombardo | first2 = Michael V. | last3 = Chakrabarti | first3 = Bhismadev | last4 = Wheelwright | first4 = Sally | last5 = Baron-Cohen | first5 = Simon | title = Response to Smith's Letter to the Editor "''Emotional Empathy in Autism Spectrum Conditions: Weak, Intact, or Heightened?''" | journal = [[Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders]] | volume = 39 | issue = 12 | page = 1749 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-009-0800-x | date = December 2009 | ref = harv }} [http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/bc249/papers/minio-paluello_2009_jadd.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050227/http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/bc249/papers/minio-paluello_2009_jadd.pdf |date=March 4, 2016 }}

Cognitive empathy can be subdivided into the following scales:&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983" /&gt;

* [[Perspective-taking]]: the tendency to spontaneously adopt others' psychological perspectives.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;
* '''Fantasy''': the tendency to identify with fictional characters.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;

== Development of empathy ==

=== Evolutionary development across species ===

An increasing number of studies in [[ethology|animal behavior]] and [[neuroscience]] claim that empathy is not restricted to humans, and is in fact as old as the mammals, or perhaps older. Examples include [[dolphin]]s saving humans from drowning or from [[shark attack]]s. Professor Tom White suggests that reports of [[cetacea]]ns having three times as many spindle cells — the nerve cells that convey empathy — in their brains as we do might mean these highly-social animals have a great awareness of one another's feelings.&lt;ref&gt;White, T. I. (2007). In defense of dolphins: the new moral frontier. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

A multitude of behaviors has been observed in [[primate]]s, both in captivity and in the wild, and in particular in [[bonobo]]s, which are reported as the most empathetic of all the primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandin|first=Jo|title=Bonobos: Encounters in Empathy|year=2007|publisher=Zoological Society of Milwaukee &amp; The Foundation for Wildlife Conservation, Inc.|location=Milwaukee|isbn=978-0-9794151-0-4|page=109|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bonobos-Encounters-Empathy-Jo-Sandin/dp/0979415101|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124025312/https://www.amazon.com/Bonobos-Encounters-Empathy-Jo-Sandin/dp/0979415101|archivedate=November 24, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The age of empathy: nature's lessons for a kinder society By: Waal, F.

For University of Chicago neurobiologist Jean Decety, [empathy] is not specific to humans. He argues that there is strong evidence that empathy has deep evolutionary, biochemical, and neurological underpinnings, and that even the most advanced forms of empathy in humans are built on more basic forms and remain connected to core mechanisms associated with affective communication, social [[attachment theory|attachment]], and [[parental care]].&lt;ref name="Decety, J"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Decety J | year = 2011 | title = The neuroevolution of empathy | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1231 | issue = 1| pages = 35–45 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06027.x | pmid=21651564|bibcode = 2011NYASA1231...35D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Core neural circuits that are involved in empathy and caring include the [[brainstem]], the [[amygdala]], [[hypothalamus]], [[basal ganglia]], [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Svetlova M. | year = 2012 | title = Putting together phylogenetic and ontogenetic perspectives on empathy | url = | journal = Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 1–24 | doi = 10.1016/j.dcn.2011.05.003 | pmid = 22682726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since all definitions of empathy involves an element of for others, all distinctions between egoism and empathy fail at least for beings lacking self-awareness. Since the first [[mammal]]s lacked a self-aware distinction between self and other, as shown by most mammals failing at [[mirror test]]s, the first mammals or anything more evolutionarily primitive than them cannot have had a context of default egoism requiring an empathy mechanism to be transcended. However, there are numerous examples in artificial intelligence research showing that simple reactions can carry out de facto functions the agents have no concept of, so this does not contradict evolutionary explanations of parental care. However, such mechanisms would be unadapted to self-other distinction and beings already dependent on some form of behavior benefitting each other or their offspring would never be able to evolve a form of self-other distinction that necessitated evolution of specialized non-preevolved and non-preevolvable mechanisms for retaining empathic behavior in the presence of self-other distinction, and so a fundamental neurological distinction between egoism and empathy cannot exist in any species.&lt;ref&gt;How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence, 2006, by Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Intelligence of Apes and Other Rational Beings 2003, Duane M.

=== Ontogenetic development in the individual ===
By the age of two years, children normally begin to display the fundamental behaviors of empathy by having an emotional response that corresponds with another person's emotional state.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, M.L. (2000). ''Empathy and Moral Development''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier, at one year of age, infants have some rudiments of empathy, in the sense that they understand that, just like their own actions, other people's actions have goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Meyer M. | year = 2008 | title = From emotion resonance to empathic understanding: A social developmental neuroscience account | url = | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 1053–1080 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579408000503 | pmid = 18838031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., Spinrad, T.L., &amp; Sadovsky, A.

''Nature Neuroscience'', 9&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, [[toddler]]s will comfort others or show concern for them at as early an age as two. Also during the second year, toddlers will play games of falsehood or "pretend" in an effort to fool others, and this requires that the child know what others believe before he or she can manipulate those beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zahn-Waxler C. |author2=Radke-Yarrow M. | year = 1990 | title = The origins of empathic concern | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 107–130 | doi = 10.1007/BF00991639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to develop these traits, it is essential to expose your child to face-to-face interactions and opportunities and lead them away from a [[sedentary lifestyle]].

According to researchers at the [[University of Chicago]] who used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), children between the ages of 7 and 12 years appear to be naturally inclined to feel empathy for others in pain. Their findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Michalska K.J. |author3=Akitsuki Y. | year = 2008 | title = Who caused the pain?

The research also found additional aspects of the brain were activated when youngsters saw another person intentionally hurt by another individual, including regions involved in moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/542456/ Brain Scans Show Children Naturally Prone to Empathy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102202203/http://newswise.com/articles/view/542456/ |date=January 2, 2009 }} Newswise. Retrieved July 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being able to show some signs of empathy, including attempting to comfort a crying baby, from as early as 18 months to two years, most children do not show a fully fledged [[theory of mind]] until around the age of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wimmer H. |author2=Perner J. | year = 1983 | title = Beliefs about beliefs: representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103–28 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5 | pmid = 6681741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind involves the ability to understand that other people may have beliefs that are different from one's own, and is thought to involve the cognitive component of empathy.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, 2003"/&gt; Children usually become capable of passing "false belief" tasks, considered to be a test for a theory of mind, around the age of four. Individuals with [[autism]] often find using a theory of mind very difficult (e.g. Baron-Cohen, Leslie &amp; Frith, 1988; the [[Sally-Anne test]]).

Empathetic maturity is a cognitive structural theory developed at the Yale University School of Nursing and addresses how adults conceive or understand the personhood of patients. The theory, first applied to nurses and since applied to other professions, postulates three levels that have the properties of cognitive structures. The third and highest level is held to be a meta-ethical theory of the moral structure of care. Those adults operating with level-III understanding synthesize systems of justice and care-based ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Douglas|title=Empathetic Maturity: Theory of Moral Point of View in Clinical Relations|journal=Advances in Nursing Science|date=September 2001|volume=24|issue=1|pages=36–46|url=http://www.nursingcenter.com/library/JournalArticle.asp?Article_ID=430999|pmid=11554532|doi=10.1097/00012272-200109000-00006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907234403/http://www.nursingcenter.com/library/JournalArticle.asp?Article_ID=430999|archivedate=September 7, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major theories and empirical findings ==

=== Influence of empathy on helping behavior ===
Emotions motivate individual behavior that aids in solving communal challenges as well as guiding group decisions about social exchange. Additionally, recent research has shown individuals who report regular experiences of gratitude engage more frequently in prosocial behaviors. Positive emotions like empathy or gratitude are linked to a more positive continual state and these people are far more likely to help others than those not experiencing a positive emotional state.&lt;ref name="Bartlett, M. 2006" /&gt; Thus, empathy's influence extends beyond relating to other's emotions, it correlates with an increased positive state and likeliness to aid others. Measures of empathy show that mirror neurons are activated during arousal of sympathetic responses and prolonged activation shows increased probability to help others.

Research investigating the social response to natural disasters looked at the characteristics associated with individuals who help victims. Researchers found that cognitive empathy, rather than emotional empathy, predicted helping behavior towards victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marjanovic|first=Zdravko|author2=Struthers, Greenglass |title=Who Helps Natural-Disaster Victims?

Yet, despite this evidence for empathy-induced altruistic motivation, egoistic explanations may still be possible. For example, one alternative explanation for the problem-specific helping pattern may be that the sequence of events in the same problem condition first made subjects sad when they empathized with the problem and then maintained or enhanced subjects’ sadness when they were later exposed to the same plight. Consequently, the negative state relief model would predict substantial helping among imagine-set subjects in the same condition, which is what occurred. An intriguing question arises from such findings concerning whether it is possible to have mixed motivations for helping. If this is the case, then simultaneous egoistic and altruistic motivations would occur. This would allow for a stronger sadness-based motivation to obscure the effects of an empathic concern-based altruistic motivation. The observed study would then have sadness as less intense than more salient altruistic motivation. Consequently, relative strengths of different emotional reactions, systematically related to the need situation, may moderate the predominance of egoistic or altruistic motivation (Dovidio, 1990). But it has been shown that researchers in this area who have used very similar procedures sometimes obtain apparently contradictory results. Superficial procedural differences such as precisely when a manipulation is introduced could also lead to divergent results and conclusions. It is therefore vital for any future research to move toward even greater standardization of measurement. Thus, an important step in solving the current theoretical debate concerning the existence of altruism may involve reaching common methodological ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dovidio J.F. |author2=Allen J.L. |author3=Schroeder D.A. | year = 1990 | title = Specificity of empathy-induced helping: Evidence for altruistic motivation | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 249–260 | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1991-01135-001 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuroscientific basis of empathy ===
Contemporary neuroscience has allowed us to understand the neural basis of the human mind's ability to understand and process emotion. Studies today enable us to see the activation of mirror neurons and attempt to explain the basic processes of empathy. By isolating these mirror neurons and measuring the neural basis for human mind reading and emotion sharing abilities,&lt;ref name="Keen Suzanne 2006 207–36"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Keen | first = Suzanne | year = 2006 | title = A Theory of Narrative Empathy | url = | journal = Narrative | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 207–36 | doi=10.1353/nar.2006.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; science has come one step closer to finding the reason for reactions like empathy. Neuroscientists have already discovered that people scoring high on empathy tests have especially busy mirror neuron systems in their brains (Dr. Christian Keysers). {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}  Empathy is a spontaneous sharing of affect, provoked by witnessing and sympathizing with another's emotional state. In a way we mirror or mimic the emotional response that we would expect to feel in that condition or context, much like sympathy. Unlike personal distress, empathy is not characterized by aversion to another's emotional response. Additionally, empathizing with someone requires a distinctly sympathetic reaction where personal distress demands avoidance of distressing matters. This distinction is vital because empathy is associated with the moral emotion sympathy, or empathetic concern, and consequently also prosocial or altruistic action.&lt;ref name="Keen Suzanne 2006 207–36"/&gt; Empathy leads to sympathy by definition unlike the over-aroused emotional response that turns into personal distress and causes a turning-away from another's distress.

In empathy we feel what we believe are the emotions of another, which makes it both affective and cognitive by most psychologists.&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"/&gt; In this sense, arousal and empathy promote prosocial behavior as we accommodate each other to feel similar emotions. For social beings, negotiating interpersonal decisions is as important to survival as being able to navigate the physical landscape.&lt;ref name="Bartlett, M. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bartlett M.

=== Gender differences ===
The literature commonly indicates that females tend to have more cognitive empathy than males. On average, female subjects score higher than males on the [[Empathy Quotient]] (EQ), while males tend to score higher on the [[Systemizing Quotient]] (SQ).

Throughout prehistory, females were the primary nurturers and caretakers of children; so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non-verbal expressions. According to the ''Primary Caretaker Hypothesis'', prehistoric males did not have the same selective pressure as primary caretakers; so therefore this might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Empathy in educational contexts ===
Another growing focus of investigation is how empathy manifests in education between teachers and learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = McAlinden | first = Maggie | contribution = Can teachers know learners' minds? Teacher empathy and learner body language in English language teaching | editor-last1 = Dunworth | editor-first1 = Katie | editor-last2 = Zhang | editor-first2 = Grace | title = Critical perspectives on language education: Australia and the Asia Pacific | pages = 71&amp;ndash;100 | publisher = Springer | location = Cham, Switzerland | year = 2014 | isbn = 9783319061856 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is general agreement that empathy is essential in educational settings, research has found that it is difficult to develop empathy in trainee teachers.&lt;ref name="Tettegah, S. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tettegah S. |author2=Anderson C. J. | year = 2007 | title = Pre-service teachers' empathy and cognitions: Statistical analysis of text data by graphical models | url = | journal = [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]] | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 48–82 | doi=10.1016/j.cedpsych.2006.10.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one theory, there are seven components involved in the effectiveness of intercultural communication; empathy was found to be one of the seven. This theory also states that empathy is learnable. However, research also shows that it is more difficult to empathize when there are differences between people including status, culture, religion, language, skin colour, gender, age and so on.&lt;ref name="Tettegah, S. 2007"/&gt;

An important target of the method [[Learning by teaching]] (LbT) is to train systematically and, in each lesson, teach empathy. Students have to transmit new content to their classmates, so they have to reflect continuously on the mental processes of the other students in the classroom. This way it is possible to develop step-by-step the students' feeling for group reactions and networking. Carl R. Rogers pioneered research in effective psychotherapy and teaching which espoused that empathy coupled with unconditional positive regard or caring for students and authenticity or congruence were the most important traits for a therapist or teacher to have. Other research and publications by Tausch, Aspy, Roebuck. Lyon, and meta-analyses by Cornelius-White, corroborated the importance of these person-centered traits.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius-White, J. H. D., and A. P. Harbaugh. (2010).

=== Empathy in intercultural contexts ===
In order to achieve intercultural empathy, psychologists have employed empathy training. One study hypothesized that empathy training would increase the measured level of relational empathy among the individuals in the experimental group when compared to the control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Keillor|first=Robin Michelle|date=1999|title=Empathy and intergroup relations: a study in cross-cultural relationship building|publisher=[[Arizona State University]]|oclc=44999879}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also hypothesized that empathy training would increase communication among the experimental group, and that perceived satisfaction with group dialogue would also increase among the experimental group. To test this, the experimenters used the Hogan Empathy Scale, the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory, and questionnaires.  Using these measures, the study found that empathy training was not successful in increasing relational empathy. Also, communication and satisfaction among groups did not increase as a result of the empathy training. While there didn’t seem to be a clear relationship between empathy and relational empathy training, the study did report that "relational empathy training appeared to foster greater expectations for a deep dialogic process resulting in treatment differences in perceived depth of communication".

US researchers William Weeks, Paul Pedersen et al. state that developing intercultural empathy enables the interpretation of experiences or perspectives from more than one worldview.&lt;ref&gt;William Weeks, Paul Pedersen, &amp; Richard Brislin (1979).

University of Portland.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developmental and environmental influences ===

The environment has been another interesting topic of study. Many theorize that environmental factors, such as parenting style and relationships, play a significant role in the development of empathy in children. Empathy promotes pro social relationships, helps mediate aggression, and allows us to relate to others, all of which make empathy an important emotion among children.

A study done by Caroline Tisot  looked at how a variety of environmental factors affected the development of empathy in young children. Parenting style, parent empathy, and prior social experiences were looked at. The children participating in the study were asked to complete an effective empathy measure, while the children's parents completed the Parenting Practices Questionnaire, which assesses parenting style, and the Balanced Emotional Empathy scale.

This study found that a few parenting practices – as opposed to parenting style as a whole – contributed to the development of empathy in children. These practices include encouraging the child to imagine the perspectives of others and teaching the child to reflect on his or her own feelings. The results also show that the development of empathy varied based on the gender of the child and parent. Paternal warmth was found to be significantly important, and was positively related to empathy within children, especially in boys. However, maternal warmth was negatively related to empathy within children, especially in girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Tisot|first=Caroline Monforte|date=2003|title=Environmental contributions to empathy development in young children|publisher=[[Temple University]]|oclc=56772472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been found that empathy can be disrupted due to trauma in the brain such as a stroke. In most cases empathy is usually impaired if a lesion or stroke occurs on the right side of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leigh|first=Richard|last2=Oishi|first2=Kenichi|last3=Hsu|first3=John|last4=Lindquist|first4=Martin|last5=Gottesman|first5=Rebecca F.|last6=Jarso|first6=Samson|last7=Crainiceanu|first7=Ciprian|last8=Mori|first8=Susumu|last9=Hillis|first9=Argye E.|date=2013-08-01|title=Acute lesions that impair affective empathy|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/136/8/2539|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=136|issue=8|pages=2539–2549|doi=10.1093/brain/awt177|issn=0006-8950|pmc=3722353|pmid=23824490|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129031206/http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/136/8/2539|archivedate=November 29, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this it has been found that damage to the frontal lobe, which is primarily responsible for emotional regulation, can impact profoundly on a person's capacity to experience empathy toward another individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sousa|first=Arielle de|last2=McDonald|first2=Skye|last3=Rushby|first3=Jacqueline|date=2012-07-01|title=Changes in emotional empathy, affective responsivity, and behavior following severe traumatic brain injury|journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology|volume=34|issue=6|pages=606–623|doi=10.1080/13803395.2012.667067|issn=1380-3395|pmid=22435955}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who have suffered from an acquired brain injury also show lower levels of empathy according to previous studies. In fact, more than 50% of people who suffer from a traumatic brain injury self-report a deficit in their empathic capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Sousa|first=Arielle|last2=McDonald|first2=Skye|last3=Rushby|first3=Jacqueline|last4=Li|first4=Sophie|last5=Dimoska|first5=Aneta|last6=James|first6=Charlotte|date=2010-10-01|title=Why don't you feel how I feel?

This is again suggestive of the fact that understanding one's own emotions is key in being able to identify with another individual’s emotional state.

== Applications ==

The empathy-altruism relationship also has broad  for whom empathy is felt at the expense of other potential pro-social goals, thus inducing a type of bias. Researchers suggest that individuals are willing to act against the greater collective good or to violate their own moral principles of fairness and justice if doing so will benefit a person for whom empathy is felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Batson C. D. |author2=Moran T. | year = 1999 | title = Empathy-induced altruism in a prisoner's dilemma | url = | journal = Eur. J. Soc. Psychol. | volume = 29 | issue = 7| pages = 909–924 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0992(199911)29:7&lt;909::aid-ejsp965&gt;3.0.co;2-l}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a more positive note, aroused individuals in an empathetic manner may focus on the long-term welfare rather than just the short-term of those in need. Empathy-based socialization is very different from current practices directed toward inhibition of egoistic impulses through shaping, modeling and internalized guilt. Therapeutic programs built around facilitating altruistic impulses by encouraging perspective taking and empathetic feelings might enable individuals to develop more satisfactory interpersonal relations, especially in the long-term. At a societal level, experiments have indicated that empathy-induced altruism can be used to improve attitudes toward stigmatized groups, even used to improve racial attitudes, actions toward people with AIDS, the homeless and even convicts. Such resulting altruism has also been found to increase cooperation in competitive situations.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, C.R. and Lopez, S.J. (Eds.). (2009). Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology. Second ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 243–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Individual differences ==

Empathy in the broadest sense refers to a reaction of one individual to another's emotional state. Recent years have seen increased movement toward the idea that empathy occurs from motor neuron imitation. But, how do we account for individual differences in empathy? It cannot be said that empathy is a single unipolar construct but rather a set of constructs. In essence, not every individual responds equally and uniformly the same to various circumstances. The Empathic Concern scale assesses "other-oriented" feelings of sympathy and concern and the Personal Distress scale measures "self-oriented" feelings of personal anxiety and unease. The combination of these scales helps reveal those that might not be classified as empathetic and expands the narrow definition of empathy. Using this approach we can enlarge the basis of what it means to possess empathetic qualities and create a multi-faceted definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = Mark H | year = 1983 | title = Measuring Individual Differences in Empathy: Evidence for a Multidimensional Approach | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 113–26 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral and neuroimaging research show that two underlying facets of the personality dimensions Extraversion and Agreeableness (the Warmth-Altruistic personality profile) are associated with empathic accuracy and increased brain activity in two brain regions important for empathic processing (medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haas|first1=BW|last2=Brook|first2=M|last3=Remillard|first3=L|last4=Ishak|first4=A|last5=Anderson|first5=IW|last6=Filkowski|first6=MM|title=I know how you feel: the warm-altruistic personality profile and the empathic brain.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2015|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e0120639|pmid=25769028|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0120639|pmc=4359130|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1020639H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empathic anger and distress ==

=== Anger ===

Empathic anger is an [[emotion]], a form of empathic distress.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w126637624m00103/ |title= Empathy and justice motivation|doi=10.1007/BF00991641 |accessdate=August 29, 2012 |year=1990|last1=Hoffman|first1=Martin L.|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume=14|issue=2|pages=151–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empathic anger is felt in a situation where someone else is being hurt by another person or thing. It is possible to see this form of anger as a [[pro-social]] emotion.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Empathic anger has direct effects on both helping and punishing desires. Empathic anger can be divided into two sub-categories: trait empathic anger and state empathic anger.&lt;ref&gt;Abstract: Assessing a new dimension of empathy: Empathic anger as a predictor of helping and punishing desires, Vitaglione, Guy D. &amp; Barnett, Mark A. {{cite web |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15290642 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514194128/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15290642 |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between empathy and anger response towards another person has also been investigated, with two studies basically finding that the higher a person's perspective taking ability, the less angry they were in response to a provocation. Empathic concern did not, however, significantly predict anger response, and higher personal distress was associated with increased anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mohr P. |author2=Howells K. |author3=Gerace A. |author4=Day A. |author5=Wharton M. | year = 2007 | title = The role of perspective taking in anger arousal | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 507–517 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2006.12.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Day A. |author2=Mohr P. |author3=Howells K. |author4=Gerace A. |author5=Lim L. | year = 2012 | title = The role of empathy in anger arousal in violent offenders and university students | url = | journal = International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology | volume = 56 | issue = 4|pages = 599–613 | doi = 10.1177/0306624X11431061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distress ===

Empathic distress is feeling the perceived pain of another person. This feeling can be transformed into empathic anger, feelings of injustice, or [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. These emotions can be perceived as pro-social, and some say they can be seen as motives for moral behavior.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt;

== Impairment in psychopathology ==

A difference in distribution between affective and cognitive empathy has been observed in various conditions. [[Psychopathy]] and [[narcissism]] have been associated with impairments in affective but not cognitive empathy, whereas [[bipolar disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder|borderline traits]] have been associated with deficits in cognitive but not affective empathy.&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt; [[Autism spectrum disorder]]s have been associated with various combinations, including deficits in cognitive empathy as well as deficits in both cognitive and affective empathy.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt;&lt;ref name="response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldwell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zero degrees" /&gt; [[Schizophrenia]], too, has been associated with deficits in both types of empathy.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017 |title=Empathic abilities in people with schizophrenia. |year=2008 |last1=Bora |first1=E. |last2=Gökçen |first2=S. |last3=Veznedaroglu |first3=B. |pmid=18514324 |volume=160 |issue=1 |journal=Psychiatry Res |pages=23–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in people without conditions such as these, the balance between affective and cognitive empathy varies.&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt;

Atypical empathic responses have been associated with [[autism spectrum|autism]] and particular [[personality disorders]] such as [[psychopathy]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]],  [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], and [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] personality disorders; [[conduct disorder]];&lt;ref name="Decety_BiologicalPsy2008" /&gt; [[schizophrenia]]; [[bipolar disorder]];&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt; and [[depersonalization]].&lt;ref name="Grossman 1996"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grossman |first=Dave |title=On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society |publisher=Back Bay Books |year=1996 |isbn=0-316-33000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of affective empathy has also been associated with sex offenders. It was found that offenders that had been raised in an environment where they were shown a lack of empathy and had endured the same type of abuse, felt less affective empathy for their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simons|first=Dominique|last2=Wurtele|first2=Sandy K.|last3=Heil|first3=Peggy|date=2002-12-01|title=Childhood Victimization and Lack of Empathy as Predictors of Sexual Offending Against Women and Children|url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/17/12/1291|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|language=en|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1291–1307|doi=10.1177/088626002237857|issn=0886-2605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autism ===

The interaction between empathy and [[autism spectrum|autism]] is a complex and ongoing field of research. Several different factors are proposed to be at play.

A study of [[high-functioning autism|high-functioning]] adults with autistic spectrum disorders found an increased prevalence of [[alexithymia]],&lt;ref name="Hill et al."&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hill E. |author2=Berthoz S. |author3=Frith U |year=2004 |title=Brief report: cognitive processing of own emotions in individuals with autistic spectrum disorder and in their relatives. |url=http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/2585/1/hill_berth_frith_jadd04.pdf |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=229–235 |doi=10.1023/B:JADD.0000022613.41399.14 |pmid=15162941 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619122446/http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/2585/1/hill_berth_frith_jadd04.pdf |archivedate=June 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a personality construct characterized by the inability to recognize and articulate emotional arousal in oneself or others.&lt;ref name="Hill et al." /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, G.J. and Bagby, R.M &amp; Parker, J.D.A.

Recently, a study has shown that high-functioning autistic adults appear to have a range of responses to music similar to that of neurotypical individuals, including the deliberate use of music for mood management.

One study found that, relative to typically developing children, high-functioning autistic children showed reduced [[mirror neuron]] activity in the brain's [[inferior frontal gyrus]] (pars opercularis) while imitating and observing emotional expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dapretto M. |author2=Davies M.S. |author3=Pfeifer J.H. |author4=Scott A.A. |author5=Sigman M. |author6=Bookheimer S.Y. |author7=Iacoboni M. | year = 2006 | title = Understanding emotions in others: mirror neuron dysfunction in children with autism spectrum disorders | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 28–31 | doi=10.1038/nn1611 | pmid=16327784 | pmc=3713227}}&lt;/ref&gt; EEG evidence revealed that there was significantly greater mu suppression in the sensorimotor cortex of autistic individuals. Activity in this area was inversely related to symptom severity in the social domain, suggesting that a dysfunctional mirror neuron system may underlie social and communication deficits observed in autism, including impaired theory of mind and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Oberman. – 'EEG evidence for mirror neuron dysfunction in autism spectrum' in Brain Research (2005) p.190&lt;/ref&gt; The mirror neuron system is essential for emotional empathy.&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;

Previous studies have suggested that autistic individuals have an impaired [[theory of mind]]. Theory of mind is the ability to understand the perspectives of others.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; The terms cognitive empathy and [[theory of mind]] are often used synonymously, but due to a lack of studies comparing theory of mind with types of empathy, it is unclear whether these are equivalent.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; Theory of mind relies on structures of the temporal lobe and the pre-frontal cortex, and empathy, i.e. the ability to share the feelings of others, relies on the sensorimotor cortices as well as limbic and para-limbic structures.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The lack of clear distinctions between [[theory of mind]] and cognitive empathy may have resulted in an incomplete understanding of the empathic abilities of those with Asperger syndrome; many reports on the empathic deficits of individuals with Asperger syndrome are actually based on impairments in theory of mind.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gillberg | first1 = C.

Studies have found that individuals on the autistic spectrum self-report lower levels of empathic concern, show less or absent comforting responses toward someone who is suffering, and report equal or higher levels of personal distress compared to controls.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; The combination in those on the autism spectrum of reduced empathic concern and increased personal distress may lead to the overall reduction of empathy.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; Professor [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] suggests that those with classic [[autism]] often lack both cognitive and affective empathy.&lt;ref name="zero degrees" /&gt; However, other research has found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton AF | title = Goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 8 | pages = 881–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19508497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.621.6275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that people with [[Asperger syndrome]] may have problems understanding others' perspectives in terms of theory of mind, but the average person with the condition demonstrates equal empathic concern as, and higher personal distress, than controls.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; The existence of individuals with heightened personal distress on the autism spectrum has been offered as an explanation as to why at least some people with autism would appear to have heightened emotional empathy,&lt;ref name="response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldwell"&gt;Phoebe Caldwell, "Letters", London Times, Dec 30 2005&lt;/ref&gt; although increased personal distress may be an effect of heightened egocentrism, emotional empathy depends on [[mirror neuron]] activity (which, as described previously, has been found to be reduced in those with autism), and empathy in people on the autism spectrum is generally reduced.&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; The empathy deficits present in autism spectrum disorders may be more indicative of impairments in the ability to take the perspective of others, while the empathy deficits in psychopathy may be more indicative of impairments in responsiveness to others’ emotions. These “disorders of empathy” further highlight the importance of the ability to empathize by illustrating some of the consequences to disrupted empathy development.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Nicole M., and Daniel S. Messinger. "The development of empathy: How, when, and why." ''Moral Behavior and Free Will: A Neurobiological and Philosophical Aprroach'' (2011): 341-368.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[empathizing–systemizing theory]] (E-S) suggests that people may be classified on the basis of their capabilities along two independent dimensions, empathizing (E) and systemizing (S). These capabilities may be inferred through tests that measure someone's Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ). Five different "brain types" can be observed among the population based on the scores, which should correlate with differences at the neural level. In the E-S theory, autism and Asperger syndrome are associated with below-average empathy and average or above-average systemizing. The E-S theory has been extended into the Extreme Male Brain theory, which suggests that people with an autism spectrum condition are more likely to have an "Extreme Type S" brain type, corresponding with above-average systemizing but challenged empathy.&lt;ref name="e-s theory"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon |year=2009 |title=Autism: The Empathizing–Systemizing (E-S) Theory |journal=[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] |volume=1156 |issue=The Year in Cognitive Neuroscience 2009 |pages=68&amp;ndash;80 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x |bibcode = 2009NYASA1156...68B |pmid=19338503 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Extreme Male Brain (EMB) theory proposes that individuals on the autistic spectrum are characterized by impairments in empathy due to sex differences in the brain: specifically, people with autism spectrum conditions show an exaggerated male profile. A study showed that some aspects of autistic neuroanatomy seem to be extremes of typical male neuroanatomy, which may be influenced by elevated levels of [[Prenatal testosterone transfer|fetal testosterone]] rather than gender itself.&lt;ref name="e-s theory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fetal testosterone"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Auyeung | first1 = Bonnie | last2 = Baron-Cohen | first2 = Simon | last3 = Ashwin | first3 = Emma | last4 = Knickmeyer | first4 = Rebecca | last5 = Taylor | first5 = Kevin | last6 = Hackett | first6 = Gerald | title = Fetal testosterone and autistic traits | journal = [[British Psychological Society#Journal|British Journal of Psychology]] | volume = 100 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;22 | doi = 10.1348/000712608X311731 | pmid = 18547459 | date = February 2009 | ref = harv | url = https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/16383524/Fetal_testosterone_and_autistic_traits.pdf }} [http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_Auyeung_etal_BJP.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809053353/http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_Auyeung_etal_BJP.pdf |date=August 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psypost.org/2016/03/testosterone-may-reduce-empathy-blocking-brain-connections-41985|title=Testosterone may reduce empathy by reducing brain connectivity|website=PsyPost|access-date=2016-04-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402081237/http://www.psypost.org/2016/03/testosterone-may-reduce-empathy-blocking-brain-connections-41985|archivedate=April 2, 2016|df=mdy-all|date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study involving brain scans of 120 men and women suggested that autism affects male and female brains differently; females with autism had brains that appeared to be closer to those of non-autistic males than females, yet the same kind of difference was not observed in males with autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Autism 'affects male and female brains differently' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23613816 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=August 9, 2013 |accessdate=August 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809170217/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23613816 |archivedate=August 9, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the discovery of a higher incidence of diagnosed autism in some groups of second generation immigrant children was initially explained as a result of too little vitamin D during pregnancy in dark-skinned people further removed from the equator, that explanation did not hold up for the later discovery that diagnosed autism was most frequent in children of newly immigrated parents and decreased if they immigrated many years earlier as that would further deplete the body's store of vitamin D. Nor could it explain the similar effect on diagnosed autism for some European migrants America in the 1940s that was reviewed in the 2010s as a shortage of vitamin D was never a problem for these light-skinned immigrants to America. The decrease of diagnosed autism with the number of years the parents had lived in their new country also cannot be explained by the theory that the cause is genetic no matter if it is said to be caused by actual ethnic differences in autism gene prevalence or a selective migration of individuals predisposed for autism since such genes, if present, would not go away over time. It have therefore been suggested that autism is not caused by an innate deficit in a specific social circuitry in the brain, also citing other research suggesting that specificalized social brain mechanisms may not exist even in neurotypic people, but that particular features of appearance and/or minor details in behavior are met with exclusion from socialization that shows up as apparently reduced social ability.&lt;ref&gt;"Immigrant Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: The Relationship between the Perspective of the Professionals and the Parents’ Point of View" 2013 Milena Pereira Pondé PhD, Cécile Rousseau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Prevalence of autism according to maternal immigrant status and ethnic origin" 2011 Marie-Jose Dealberto&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychopathy is a personality disorder partly characterized by antisocial and aggressive behaviors, as well as emotional and interpersonal deficits including shallow emotions and a lack of [[remorse]] and empathy.&lt;ref name="Cleckly, 1941"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cleckly|first=H.

A large body of research suggests that psychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues (e.g. facial and vocal expressions of fear and [[sadness]]), including decreased activation of the [[Fusiform gyrus|fusiform]] and [[Extrastriate cortex|extrastriate cortical]] regions, which may partly account for impaired recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of fear, and impairments of empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Skelly, L.

A recent study on psychopaths found that, under certain circumstances, they could willfully empathize with others, and that their empathic reaction initiated the same way it does for controls. Psychopathic criminals were brain-scanned while watching videos of a person harming another individual. The psychopaths' empathic reaction initiated the same way it did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the harmed individual, and the area of the brain relating to pain was activated when the psychopaths were asked to imagine how the harmed individual felt. The research suggests how psychopaths could switch empathy on at will, which would enable them to be both callous and charming. The team who conducted the study say it is still unknown how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people have, though they propose it could be possible to bring psychopaths closer to rehabilitation by helping them to activate their "empathy switch". Others suggested that despite the results of the study, it remained unclear whether psychopaths' experience of empathy was the same as that of controls, and also questioned the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions that would make the empathic reactions more automatic.&lt;ref name="empathy switch"&gt;{{cite news |title=Psychopathic criminals have empathy switch |first=Melissa |last=Hogenboom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431793 |newspaper=BBC News |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=July 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727080108/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431793 |archivedate=July 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Tanya.

Work conducted by Professor [[Jean Decety]] with large samples of incarcerated psychopaths offers additional insights. In one study, psychopaths were scanned while viewing video clips depicting people being intentionally hurt. They were also tested on their responses to seeing short videos of facial expressions of pain. The participants in the high-psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], [[amygdala]] and [[periaqueductal gray]] parts of the brain, but more activity in the [[striatum]] and the [[insular cortex|insula]] when compared to control participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Decety | first1 = J. | last2 = Skelly | first2 = L.

It was predicted that people who have high levels of psychopathy would have sufficient levels of cognitive empathy but would lack in their ability to use affective empathy. People that scored highly on psychopathy measures were less likely to portray affective empathy. There was a strong negative correlation showing that psychopathy and affective empathy correspond strongly. The DANVA-2 portrayed those who scored highly on the psychopathy scale do not lack in recognising emotion in facial expressions. Therefore, individuals who have high scores on psychopathy and do not lack in perspective-talking ability but do lack in compassion and the negative incidents that happen to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mullins-Nelson | first1 = Jana L. | last2 = Salekin | first2 = Randall T. | last3 = Anne-Marie | first3 = R.

Despite studies suggesting deficits in emotion perception and imagining others in pain, professor [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] claims psychopathy is associated with intact cognitive empathy, which would imply an intact ability to read and respond to behaviors, social cues and what others are feeling. Psychopathy is, however, associated with impairment in the other major component of empathy—affective (emotional) empathy—which includes the ability to ''feel'' the suffering and emotions of others (what scientists would term as [[emotional contagion]]), and those with the condition are therefore not distressed by the suffering of their victims. Such a dissociation of affective and cognitive empathy has indeed been demonstrated for aggressive offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winter|first=Korina|last2=Spengler|first2=Stephanie|last3=Bermpohl|first3=Felix|last4=Singer|first4=Tania|last5=Kanske|first5=Philipp|date=2017-04-06|title=Social cognition in aggressive offenders: Impaired empathy, but intact theory of mind|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00745-0|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-00745-0|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2017NatSR...7..670W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with [[Autism spectrum disorder|autism]], on the other hand, are claimed to be often impaired in both affective and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name="zero degrees"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baron-Cohen |first=Simon |title=Zero Degrees of Empathy: A New Theory of Human Cruelty |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QUPgbxY4C4C |accessdate=August 8, 2013 |year=2011 |publisher=Penguin UK |location= |isbn= 9780713997910|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem with the theory that the ability to turn empathy on and off constitutes psychopathy is that such a theory would classify socially sanctioned violence and [[punishment]] as psychopathy, as it means suspending empathy towards certain individuals and/or groups. The attempt to get around this by standardizing tests of psychopathy for cultures with different norms of punishment is criticized in this context for being based on the assumption that people can be classified in discrete cultures while cultural influences are in reality mixed and every person encounters a mosaic of influences (e.g. non-shared environment having more influence than family environment). It is suggested that psychopathy may be an artefact of psychiatry's standardization along imaginary sharp lines between cultures, as opposed to an actual difference in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;“How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain” 2017 Lisa Feldman Barrett&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Role of Culture in Empathy: The Consequences and Explanations of Cultural Differences in Empathy at the Affective and Cognitive Levels" 2014 David Atkins&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other conditions ===

Research indicates atypical empathic responses are also correlated with a variety of other conditions.

[[Borderline personality disorder]] is characterized by extensive behavioral and interpersonal difficulties that arise from emotional and cognitive dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Minzenberg et al., 2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minzenberg|first=M.J.|first2=M.|last2=Fisher-Irving|first3=J.H.|last3=Poole|first4=S.|last4=Vinogradov|year=2006|title=Reduced self-referential source memory performance is associated with interpersonal dysfunction in borderline personality disorder|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders|url=http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/minzenberg_fisher_etal_JPD2006.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516001713/http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/minzenberg_fisher_etal_JPD2006.pdf|archivedate=May 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dysfunctional social and interpersonal behavior has been shown to play a crucial role in the emotionally intense way people with borderline personality disorder react.&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; While individuals with borderline personality disorder may show their emotions too much, several authors have suggested that they might have a compromised ability to reflect upon mental states (impaired [[cognitive empathy]]), as well as an impaired [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; People with borderline personality disorder have been shown to be very good at recognizing emotions in people's faces, suggesting increased empathic capacities.&lt;ref name="Wagner and Linehan, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=A.W.|author2=M.M Linehan|year=1999|title=Facial expression recognition ability among women with borderline personality disorder: implications for emotion regulation?|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynch|first=T.R.|first2=M.Z. |last2=Rosenthal |first3=D.S. |last3=Kosson |first4=J.S. |last4=Cheavens |first5=C.W. |last5=Lejuez |first6=R.J. |last6=Blair|year=2006|title=Heightened sensitivity to facial expressions of emotion in borderline personality disorder.|journal=Emotion|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.4.647 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=647–655}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, therefore, possible that impaired cognitive empathy (the capacity for understanding another person's experience and perspective) may account for borderline personality disorder individuals' tendency for interpersonal dysfunction, while "hyper-emotional empathy"{{Verify source|date=August 2013}} may account for the emotional over-reactivity observed in these individuals.&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; One primary study confirmed that patients with borderline personality disorder were significantly impaired in cognitive empathy, yet there was no sign of impairment in affective empathy.&lt;ref name=Harari&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harari|first=Hagai|author2=Simone G.

One diagnostic criterion of [[narcissistic personality disorder]] is a lack of empathy and an unwillingness or inability to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR npd"&gt;[http://behavenet.com/narcissistic-personality-disorder Narcissistic personality disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120212711/http://behavenet.com/narcissistic-personality-disorder |date=January 20, 2013 }} – [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper empathic engagement helps an individual understand and anticipate the behavior of another. Apart from the automatic tendency to recognize the emotions of others, one may also deliberately engage in empathic reasoning. Two general methods have been identified here. An individual may simulate fictitious versions of the beliefs, desires, character traits and context of another individual to see what emotional feelings it provokes. Or, an individual may simulate an emotional feeling and then access the environment for a suitable reason for the emotional feeling to be appropriate for that specific environment.&lt;ref name="DeWaal"&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Waal F.

Some research suggests that people are more able and willing to empathize with those most similar to themselves. In particular, empathy increases with similarities in culture and living conditions. Empathy is more likely to occur between individuals whose interaction is more frequent. (See Levenson and Reuf 1997 and Hoffman 2000: 62). A measure of how well a person can infer the specific content of another person's thoughts and feelings has been developed by William Ickes (1997, 2003). [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] an anti-empathy crusader claims emotional engagement of empathy leads to racism and prejudice.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} In 2010, team led by Grit Hein and Tania Singer gave two groups of men wristbands according to which football team they supported.

There are concerns that the empathizer's own emotional background may affect or distort what emotions they perceive in others (e.g. Goleman 1996: p.&amp;nbsp;104). It is evidenced that societies that promote individualism have lower ability for empathy.&lt;ref name="WeinerCraighead2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Irving B. Weiner|author2=W.

== Ethical issues ==

The extent to which a person's emotions are publicly observable, or mutually recognized as such has significant social consequences. Empathic recognition may or may not be welcomed or socially desirable. This is particularly the case where we recognize the emotions that someone has towards us during real time interactions. Based on a metaphorical affinity with touch, philosopher Edith Wyschogrod claims that the proximity entailed by empathy increases the potential vulnerability of either party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wyschogrod E | year = 1981 | title = Empathy and sympathy as tactile encounter | url = | journal = J Med Philos | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 25–43 | doi = 10.1093/jmp/6.1.25 | pmid = 7229562 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appropriate role of empathy in our dealings with others is highly dependent on the circumstances. For instance, [[Tania Singer]] says that clinicians or caregivers must be objective to the emotions of others, to not over-invest their own emotions for the other, at the risk of [[compassion fatigue|draining away]] their own resourcefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/12/tania-singer-compassion-burnout|title=Compassion over empathy could help prevent emotional burnout|work=Wired UK|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515020421/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/12/tania-singer-compassion-burnout|archivedate=May 15, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, an awareness of the limitations of empathic accuracy is prudent in a [[caregiving]] situation.

==== Ethics ====

In his 2008 book, ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time:Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong]]'', writer [[Iain King]] presents two reasons why empathy is the "essence" or "DNA" of right and wrong. First, he argues that empathy uniquely has all the characteristics we can know about an ethical viewpoint&lt;ref&gt;''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong'', (2008), {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; – including that it is "partly self-standing", and so provides a source of motivation that is partly within us and partly outside, as moral motivations seem to be.&lt;ref name="King2008-74"&gt;{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=empathy%20iain%20king&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q=empathy%20iain%20king&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 28, 2013|publisher=Continuum|date=16 October 2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=74|quote=Empathy is special, because it always and automatically has the characteristics of right and wrong&amp;nbsp;... Something rooted in empathy must have more of the essence of good about it than something which is not.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows empathy-based judgements to have sufficient distance from a personal opinion to count as "moral". His second argument is more practical: he argues, "Empathy for others really is the route to value in life", and so the means by which a selfish attitude can become a moral one. By using empathy as the basis for a system of ethics, King is able to reconcile ethics based on [[Consequentialism|consequences]] with [[Virtue Ethics|virtue-ethics]] and [[Deontological ethics|act-based]] accounts of right and wrong.&lt;ref name="King2008-227"&gt;{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&amp;lpg=PA227|publisher=Continuum|location=London|date=2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; His empathy-based system has been taken up by some [[Buddhism|Buddhists]],&lt;ref&gt;A Buddhist account of Iain King's ideas is set out in [http://www.experiencefestival.com/wp/article/iain-king-ethics this] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020235032/http://www.experiencefestival.com/wp/article/iain-king-ethics |date=October 20, 2012 }} Global Oneness article.&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to address some practical problems, such as when to tell [[Lie#Ethics|lies]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Publishers Weekly]] state that "King is even able to formulate a credible rule that tells us when to lie" [http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84706-347-2 here.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030514/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84706-347-2 |date=November 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and how to develop culturally-neutral [[Romance (love)#In philosophy|rules for romance]].

In the 2007 book ''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', philosopher [[Michael Slote]] introduces a theory of care-based ethics that is grounded in empathy. His claim is that moral motivation does, and should, stem from a basis of empathic response. He claims that our natural reaction to situations of moral significance are explained by empathy. He explains that the limits and obligations of empathy and in turn morality are natural. These natural obligations include a greater empathic, and moral obligation to family and friends, along with an account of temporal and physical distance. In situations of close temporal and physical distance, and with family or friends, our moral obligation seems stronger to us than with strangers at a distance naturally. Slote explains that this is due to empathy and our natural empathic ties. He further adds that actions are wrong if and only if they reflect or exhibit a deficiency of fully developed empathic concern for others on the part of the agent.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', Michael Slote, Oxford University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phenomenology ====

In [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], empathy describes the experience of something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and [[Other (philosophy)|other]]. This draws on the [[sense of agency]]. In the most basic sense, this is the experience of the other's body and, in this sense, it is an experience of "my body over there". In most other respects, however, the experience is modified so that what is experienced is experienced as being the other's experience; in experiencing empathy, what is experienced is not "my" experience, even though ''I'' experience it. Empathy is also considered to be the condition of [[intersubjectivity]] and, as such, the source of the constitution of objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;''Empathy in the Context of Philosophy'', Lou Agosta, Palgrave/Macmillan, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===

Some postmodern historians such as [[Keith Jenkins]] in recent years have debated whether or not it is possible to empathize with people from the past. Jenkins argues that empathy only enjoys such a privileged position in the present because it corresponds harmoniously with the dominant [[Liberalism|liberal]] discourse of modern society and can be connected to [[John Stuart Mill]]'s concept of reciprocal freedom. Jenkins argues the past is a foreign country and as we do not have access to the [[epistemological]] conditions of by gone ages we are unable to empathize.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, K. (1991) ''Re-thinking History'' London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

It is impossible to forecast the effect of empathy on the future.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} A past subject may take part in the present by the so-called historic present. If we watch from a fictitious past, can tell the present with the future tense, as it happens with the trick of the false prophecy. There is no way of telling the present with the means of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Pozzi, G. (1976) Prefazione 6. L'elemento storico e politico -sociale, in G.B. Marino, ''L'Adone'' Milano&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychotherapy ===

[[Heinz Kohut]] is the main introducer of the principle of empathy in psychoanalysis. His principle applies to the method of gathering unconscious material. The possibility of not applying the principle is granted in the cure, for instance when you must reckon with another principle, that of reality.

In evolutionary psychology, attempts at explaining pro-social behavior often mention the presence of empathy in the individual as a possible variable. While exact motives behind complex social behaviors are difficult to distinguish, the "ability to put oneself in the shoes of another person and experience events and emotions the way that person experienced them" is the definitive factor for truly altruistic behavior according to Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis. If empathy is not felt, social exchange (what's in it for me?) supersedes pure altruism, but if empathy is felt, an individual will help by actions or by word, regardless of whether it is in their self-interest to do so and even if the costs outweigh potential rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aronson | first = Elliot | authorlink = Elliot Aronson | last2 = Wilson |first2=Timothy D. |last3=Akert |first3=Robin | title = Social Psychology, 6th Edition | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-13-238245-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business and management ===

In the 2009 book ''Wired to Care'', strategy consultant [[Dev Patnaik]] argues that a major flaw in contemporary business practice is a lack of empathy inside large corporations. He states that lacking any sense of empathy, people inside companies struggle to make intuitive decisions and often get fooled into believing they understand their business if they have quantitative research to rely upon. Patnaik claims that the real opportunity for companies doing business in the 21st century is to create a widely held sense of empathy for customers, pointing to [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Harley-Davidson]], and [[IBM]] as examples of "Open Empathy Organizations". Such institutions, he claims, see new opportunities more quickly than competitors, adapt to change more easily, and create workplaces that offer employees a greater sense of mission in their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiredtocare.com|title=Wired To Care|work=wiredtocare.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210095811/http://www.wiredtocare.com/|archivedate=December 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 book ''The Empathy Factor'', organizational consultant [[Marie Miyashiro]] similarly argues the value of bringing empathy to the workplace, and offers [[Nonviolent Communication]] as an effective mechanism for achieving this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Empathy Factor: Your Competitive Advantage for Personal, Team, and Business Success

== Measurement ==
{{citation style|section|date=July 2013}}
Research into the measurement of empathy has sought to answer a number of questions: who should be carrying out the measurement? What should pass for empathy and what should be discounted? What unit of measure (UOM) should be adopted and to what degree should each occurrence precisely match that UOM are also key questions that researchers have sought to investigate.

Researchers have approached the measurement of empathy from a number of perspectives.

Behavioral measures normally involve raters assessing the presence or absence of certain either predetermined or ad-hoc behaviors in the subjects they are monitoring. Both verbal and non-verbal behaviors have been captured on video by experimenters such as Truax (1967b).&lt;ref&gt;Truax, C. B. (1967). Rating of Accurate Empathy. The Therapeutic Relationship and its Impact. A Study of Psychotherapy with Schizophrenics. Eds. C. R. Rogers, E. T. Gendlin, D. J. Kiesler and C. B. Truax. Madison, Wisconsin, The University of Wisconsin Press pp.&amp;nbsp;555–568.&lt;/ref&gt; Other experimenters, including Mehrabian and Epstein (1972),&lt;ref name="Mehrabian A., Epstein N. 1972 525–543"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mehrabian A. |author2=Epstein N. | year = 1972 | title = A measure of emotional empathy | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 525–543 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1972.tb00078.x | pmid = 4642390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have required subjects to comment upon their own feelings and behaviors, or those of other people involved in the experiment, as indirect ways of signaling their level of empathic functioning to the raters.

Physiological responses tend to be captured by elaborate electronic equipment that has been physically connected to the subject's body. Researchers then draw inferences about that person's empathic reactions from the electronic readings produced (e.g. Levenson and Ruef, 1992;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Levenson R. W. |author2=Ruef A. M. | year = 1992 | title = Empathy: a physiological substrate | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 63 | issue = 2| pages = 234–246 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.63.2.234 | pmid = 1403614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie et al., 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Leslie K. R. |author2=Johnson-Frey S. H. | year = 2004 | title = Functional imaging of face and hand imitation: towards a motor theory of empathy | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 601–607 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.09.038 | pmid = 14980562 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Bodily or "somatic" measures can be looked upon as behavioral measures at a micro level. Their focus is upon measuring empathy through facial and other non-verbally expressed reactions in the empathizer. These changes are presumably underpinned by physiological changes brought about by some form of "emotional contagion" or mirroring (e.g. Levenson and Ruef, 1992*; Leslie et al., 2004*). It should be pointed out that these reactions, whilst appearing to reflect the internal emotional state of the empathizer, could also, if the stimulus incident lasted more than the briefest period, be reflecting the results of emotional reactions that are based upon more pieces of thinking through (cognitions) associated with role-taking ("if I were him I would feel&amp;nbsp;...").

Paper-based indices involve one or more of a variety of methods of responding. In some experiments, subjects are required to watch video scenarios (either staged or authentic) and to make written responses which are then assessed for their levels of empathy (e.g. Geher, Warner and Brown, 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Geher G. |author2=Warner R. M. | year = 2001 | title = Predictive validity of the emotional accuracy research scale | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 373–388 | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(00)00045-3 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;); scenarios are sometimes also depicted in printed form (e.g. Mehrabian and Epstein, 1972&lt;ref name="Mehrabian A., Epstein N. 1972 525–543"/&gt;). Measures also frequently require subjects to self-report upon their own ability or capacity for empathy, using Likert-style numerical responses to a printed questionnaire that may have been designed to tap into the affective, cognitive-affective or largely cognitive substrates of empathic functioning. Some questionnaires claim to have been able to tap into both cognitive and affective substrates (e.g. Davis, 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davis M. H. | year = 1980 | title = A multidimensional approach to individual differences in empathy | url = | journal = JSAS Catalogue of selected documents in psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 1–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). More recent paper-based tools include The [[Empathy Quotient]] (EQ) created by [[Simon Baron-Cohen|Baron-Cohen]] and Wheelwright&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Baron-Cohen S. |author2=Wheelwright S. |year=2004 |title=The empathy quotient: an investigation of adults with Asperger Syndrome or high functioning autism, and normal sex differences |url=http://www.queensu.ca/rarc/services/ASDAssessmentTemplate/ResourcesfromRobertGauthierfromRARCworkshop2014/EQArticle.pdf |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=163–175 |doi=10.1023/B:JADD.0000022607.19833.00 |pmid=15162935 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304035846/http://www.queensu.ca/rarc/services/ASDAssessmentTemplate/ResourcesfromRobertGauthierfromRARCworkshop2014/EQArticle.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which comprises a self-report questionnaire consisting of 60 items.

For the very young, picture or puppet-story indices for empathy have been adopted to enable even very young, pre-school subjects to respond without needing to read questions and write answers (e.g. Denham and Couchoud, 1990). Dependent variables (variables that are monitored for any change by the experimenter) for younger subjects have included self reporting on a 7-point smiley face scale and filmed facial reactions (Barnett, 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barnett M. A. | year = 1984 | title = Similarity of experience and empathy in preschoolers | url = | journal = Journal of Genetic Psychology | volume = 145 | issue = 2| pages = 241–250 | doi = 10.1080/00221325.1984.10532271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A certain amount of confusion exists about how to measure empathy. These may be rooted in another problem: deciding what empathy is and what it is not. In general, researchers have until now been keen to pin down a singular definition of empathy which would allow them to design a measure to assess its presence in an exchange, in someone's repertoire of behaviors or within them as a latent trait. As a result, they have been frequently forced to ignore the richness of the empathic process in favor of capturing surface, explicit self-report or third-party data about whether empathy between two people was present or not. In most cases, instruments have unfortunately only yielded information on whether someone had the potential to demonstrate empathy (Geher et al., 2001)*. Gladstein (1987)&lt;ref&gt;Gladstein, G. A. (1987). What It All Means. Empathy and counseling: explorations in theory and research. G. A. Gladstein. New York, Springer-Verlag: 173–189.&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes the position noting that empathy has been measured from the point of view of the empathizer, the recipient for empathy and the third-party observer. He suggests that since the multiple measures used have produced results that bear little relation to one another, researchers should refrain from making comparisons between scales that are in fact measuring different things. He suggests that researchers should instead stipulate what kind of empathy they are setting out to measure rather than simplistically stating that they are setting out to measure the unitary phenomenon "empathy"; a view more recently endorsed by Duan and Hill (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Duan C. |author2=Hill C. E. | year = 1996 | title = The current state of empathy research | url = | journal = Journal of Counselling Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 261–274 | doi = 10.1037/0022-0167.43.3.261 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of medicine, a measurement tool for carers is the ''Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, Health Professional Version (JSPE-HP)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen D, Lew R, Hershman W, Orlander J |year= 2007 |title= A cross-sectional measurement of medical student empathy |journal= J Gen Intern Med |volume= 22 |issue= 10 |pages= 1434–8 |publisher= |doi= 10.1007/s11606-007-0298-x |pmc= 2305857 |pmid= 17653807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) is the only published measurement tool to date that accounts for a multi-dimensional assessment of empathy. It comprises a self-report questionnaire of 28 items, divided into four 7-item scales covering the above subdivisions of affective and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davis M | year = 1983 | title = Measuring individual differences in empathy: evidence for a multidimensional approach | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 113–126 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983" /&gt;

== Other animals ==

Research has shown that the ability of empathy in other species is attainable. Many instances of empathy have been recorded throughout many species, including (but not limited to) canines, felines, dolphins, primates, rats and mice {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. In animals, empathy-related responding could have an ulterior motive such as survival, the sharing of food, companionship and pack-oriented mentality. It is certainly difficult to understand an animal's intention behind an empathic response. Many researchers{{Who|weasel|date=May 2014}} maintain that applying the term empathy in general to animal behavior is an act of [[anthropomorphism]].

Researchers Zanna Clay and [[Frans de Waal]] studied the socio-emotional development of the [[bonobo]] chimpanzee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clay|author2=Zanna|title=Development of socio-emotional competence in bonobos.|journal=US: National Academy of Sciences.|date=November 5, 2014|volume=110|issue=45|pages=18121–18126|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=181339d9-1520-40c7-a9e4-ce8ac385d6d9%40sessionmgr115&amp;hid=120&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-39226-002|doi=10.1073/pnas.1316449110|bibcode = 2013PNAS..11018121C |pmc=3831480}}&lt;/ref&gt; They focused on the interplay of numerous skills such as empathy-related responding, and how different rearing backgrounds of the juvenile bonobo affected their response to stressful events, related to themselves (loss of a fight) and of stressful events of others. It was found that the bonobos  sought out body contact as a coping mechanism with one another. A finding of this study was that the bonobos sought out more body contact after watching a distressing event upon the other bonobos rather than their individually experienced stressful event. Mother-reared bonobos as opposed to orphaned bonobos sought out more physical contact after a stressful event happened to another. This finding shows the importance of mother-child attachment and bonding, and how it may be crucial to successful socio-emotional development, such as empathic-like behaviors.

Empathic-like responding has been observed in [[chimpanzees]] in various different aspects of their natural behaviors. For example, chimpanzees are known to spontaneously contribute comforting behaviors to victims of aggressive behavior in natural and unnatural settings, a behavior recognized as consolation. Researchers Teresa Romero and co-workers observed these empathic and sympathetic-like behaviors in chimpanzees at two separate outdoor housed groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romero|author2=Teresa|title=Consolation as possible expression of sympathetic concern among chimpanzees|journal=US: National Academy of Sciences.|date=July 6, 2010|volume=107|issue=27|pages=12110–12115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1006991107|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=11&amp;sid=24706b87-cfc3-4942-8f8f-8d4fa8b29f28%40sessionmgr198&amp;hid=128&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2010-14411-001|accessdate=February 15, 2014|bibcode = 2010PNAS..10712110R |pmc=2901437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of consolation was observed in both of the groups of chimpanzees. This behavior is found in humans, and particularly in human infants. Another similarity found between chimpanzees and humans is that empathic-like responding was disproportionately provided to individuals of kin. Although comforting towards non-family chimpanzees was also observed, as with humans, chimpanzees showed the majority of comfort and concern to close/loved ones. Another similarity between chimpanzee and human expression of empathy is that females provided more comfort than males on average. The only exception to this discovery was that high-ranking males showed as much empathy-like behavior as their female counterparts. This is believed to be because of policing-like behavior and the authoritative status of high-ranking male chimpanzees.

It is thought that species that possess a more intricate and developed prefrontal cortex have more of an ability of experiencing empathy. It has however been found that empathic and altruistic responses may also be found in sand dwelling Mediterranean ants. Researcher Hollis studied the ''[[Cataglyphis cursor]]'' sand dwelling Mediterranean ant and their rescue behaviors by ensnaring ants from a nest in nylon threads and partially buried beneath the sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollis|first=Karen|title=A comparative analysis of precision rescue behaviour in sand-dwelling ants|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=March 2013|volume=85|series=Animal Behaviour|issue=3|pages=537–544|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.12.005|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=bf4000d0-6a9c-4225-8ebf-82db56f427e8%40sessionmgr113&amp;hid=128&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-01472-001|accessdate=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ants not ensnared in the nylon thread proceeded to attempt to rescue their nest mates by sand digging, limb pulling, transporting sand away from the trapped ant, and when efforts remained unfruitful, began to attack the nylon thread itself; biting and pulling apart the threads.  Similar rescue behavior was found in other sand-dwelling Mediterranean ants, but only ''[[Cataglyphis floricola]]'' and ''[[Lasius grandis]]'' species of ants showed the same rescue behaviors of transporting sand away from the trapped victim and directing attention towards the nylon thread. It was observed in all ant species that rescue behavior was only directed towards nest mates. Ants of the same species from different nests were treated with aggression and were continually attacked and pursued, which speaks to the depths of ants discriminative abilities. This study brings up the possibility that if ants have the capacity for empathy and/or altruism, these complex processes may be derived from primitive and simpler mechanisms.

[[Dog|Canines]] have been hypothesized to share empathic-like responding towards human species. Researchers Custance and Mayer put individual dogs in an enclosure with their owner and a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-012-0510-1 |last=Custance|first=Deborah|author2=Jennifer Mayer|title=Empathetic-like responding by domestic dogs (canis familiaris) to distress in humans|journal=Animal Cognition|date=29 May 2012|volume=15|issue=851–859|doi=10.1007/s10071-012-0510-1|accessdate=October 5, 2014|pages=851–859|pmid=22644113}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the participants were talking or humming, the dog showed no behavioral changes, however when the participants were pretending to cry, the dogs oriented their behavior toward the person in distress whether it be the owner or stranger. The dogs approached the participants when crying in a submissive fashion, by sniffing, licking and nuzzling the distressed person. The dogs did not approach the participants in the usual form of excitement, tail wagging or panting. Since the dogs did not direct their empathic-like responses only towards their owner, it is hypothesized that dogs generally seek out humans showing distressing body behavior. Although this could insinuate that dogs have the cognitive capacity for empathy, this could also mean that domesticated dogs have learned to comfort distressed humans through generations of being rewarded for that specific behavior.

When witnessing chicks in distress, domesticated hens, ''[[Gallus gallus domesticus]]'' show emotional and physiological responding. Researchers Edgar, Paul and Nicol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgar|first=J|author2=Paul|title=Protective Mother Hens: Cognitive influences on the avian maternal response|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=Aug 2013|volume=86|issue=2|pages=223–229|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.004|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=c35dba7e-d8a4-4b46-8855-20319f7a74e3%40sessionmgr4001&amp;hid=4214&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-21521-001 |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that in conditions where the chick was susceptible to danger, the mother hens heart rate increased, vocal alarms were sounded, personal preening decreased and body temperature increased. This responding happened whether or not the chick felt as if they were in danger. Mother hens experienced stress-induced hyperthermia only when the chick's behavior correlated with the perceived threat. Animal maternal behavior may be perceived as empathy, however, it could be guided by the evolutionary principles of survival and not emotionality.

In [[telecommunication]]s, '''extinction ratio''' (''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) is the [[ratio]] of two optical [[Power (physics)|power]] levels of a [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]] generated by an [[optical source]], e.g., a [[laser diode]]. The extinction ratio may be expressed as a fraction, in [[decibel|dB]], or as a [[percentage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timbercon.com/Extinction-Ratio.html|title=Extinction Ratio|publisher=Timbercon|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be given by

where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the optical power level generated when the light source is on, and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the power level generated when the light source is off.

The '''polarization extinction ratio''' ('''PER''') is the ratio of optical powers of perpendicular polarizations, usually called TE (transverse electrical) and TM (transverse magnetic). In [[telecommunication]]s, the PER is used to characterize the degree of polarization in a polarization-maintaining device or fiber. For coherent transmitter and receiver, the PER is a key parameter, since X&amp;nbsp;polarization and Y&amp;nbsp;polarization are coded with different signals.

In [[theoretical physics]], '''Feynman diagrams''' are pictorial representations of the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of [[subatomic particle]]s. The scheme is named after its inventor, American physicist [[Richard Feynman]], and was first introduced in 1948. The interaction of sub-atomic particles can be complex and difficult to understand intuitively. Feynman diagrams give a simple visualization of what would otherwise be an arcane and abstract formula. As [[David Kaiser]] writes, "since the middle of the 20th century, theoretical physicists have increasingly turned to this tool to help them undertake critical calculations", and so "Feynman diagrams have revolutionized nearly every aspect of theoretical physics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaiser |first=David |year=2005 |title=Physics and Feynman's Diagrams |url=http://web.mit.edu/dikaiser/www/FdsAmSci.pdf |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=93 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the diagrams are applied primarily to [[quantum field theory]], they can also be used in other fields, such as [[solid-state physics|solid-state theory]].

Feynman used [[Ernst Stueckelberg]]'s interpretation of the [[positron]] as if it were an electron moving backward in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feynman |first=Richard |title=The Theory of Positrons |journal=Physical Review |issue=76 |year=1949 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.76.749 |volume=76 |pages=749 |bibcode = 1949PhRv...76..749F |quote="In this solution, the "negative energy states" appear in a form which may be pictured (as by Stückelberg) in space-time as waves traveling away from the external potential backwards in time. Experimentally, such a wave corresponds to a positron approaching the potential and annihilating the electron."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[antiparticle]]s are represented as moving backward along the time axis in Feynman diagrams.

The calculation of [[probability amplitude]]s in theoretical particle physics requires the use of rather large and complicated integrals over a large number of variables. These integrals do, however, have a regular structure, and may be represented graphically as Feynman diagrams.

A Feynman diagram is a contribution of a particular class of particle paths, which join and split as described by the diagram. More precisely, and technically, a Feynman diagram is a graphical representation of a [[perturbative]] contribution to the [[transition amplitude]] or correlation function of a quantum mechanical or statistical field theory. Within the [[canonical quantization|canonical]] formulation of quantum field theory, a Feynman diagram represents a term in the [[Wick's theorem|Wick's expansion]] of the perturbative [[S-matrix|{{mvar|S}}-matrix]]. Alternatively, the [[path integral formulation]] of quantum field theory represents the transition amplitude as a weighted sum of all possible histories of the system from the initial to the final state, in terms of either particles or fields. The transition amplitude is then given as the matrix element of the {{mvar|S}}-matrix between the initial and the final states of the quantum system.

== Motivation and history ==
[[File:Kaon-Decay.svg|301px|thumb|right|In this diagram, a [[kaon]], made of an up and anti-strange quark, decays both [[Weak interaction|weakly]] and strongly into three [[pion]]s, with intermediate steps involving a [[W and Z bosons|W boson]] and a [[gluon]] (represented by the blue sine wave and green spiral, respectively).]]

When calculating [[scattering cross-section]]s in [[particle physics]], the interaction between particles can be described by starting from a [[free field]] that describes the incoming and outgoing particles, and including an interaction [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] to describe how the particles deflect one another. The amplitude for scattering is the sum of each possible interaction history over all possible intermediate particle states. The number of times the interaction Hamiltonian acts is the order of the [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation expansion]], and the time-dependent perturbation theory for fields is known as the [[Dyson series]]. When the intermediate states at intermediate times are energy [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenstates]] (collections of particles with a definite momentum) the series is called [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)#Time-dependent perturbation theory|old-fashioned perturbation theory]].

The Dyson series can be alternatively rewritten as a sum over Feynman diagrams, where at each vertex both the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] are [[conservation law|conserved]], but where the length of the [[four-momentum|energy-momentum four-vector]] is not necessarily equal to the mass. The Feynman diagrams are much easier to keep track of than “old-fashioned” terms, because the old-fashioned way treats the particle and antiparticle contributions as separate. Each Feynman diagram is the sum of exponentially many old-fashioned terms, because each internal line can separately represent either a particle or an antiparticle. In a non-relativistic theory, there are no antiparticles and there is no doubling, so each Feynman diagram includes only one term.

Feynman gave a prescription for calculating the amplitude ([[#Feynman rules|the Feynman rules, below]]) for any given diagram from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|field theory Lagrangian]]. Each internal line corresponds to a factor of the [[virtual particle]]'s [[propagator]]; each vertex where lines meet gives a factor derived from an interaction term in the Lagrangian, and incoming and outgoing lines carry an energy, momentum, and [[spin (physics)|spin]].

In addition to their value as a mathematical tool, Feynman diagrams provide deep physical insight into the nature of particle interactions. Particles interact in every way available; in fact, intermediate virtual particles are allowed to propagate faster than light. The probability of each final state is then obtained by summing over all such possibilities. This is closely tied to the [[functional integral]] formulation of [[quantum mechanics]], also invented by Feynman—see [[path integral formulation]].

The naïve application of such calculations often produces diagrams whose amplitudes are [[infinity|infinite]], because the short-distance particle interactions require a careful limiting procedure, to include particle [[self-interaction]]s. The technique of [[renormalization]], suggested by [[Ernst Stueckelberg]] and [[Hans Bethe]] and implemented by [[Freeman Dyson|Dyson]], Feynman, [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]], and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga|Tomonaga]] compensates for this effect and eliminates the troublesome infinities. After renormalization, calculations using Feynman diagrams match experimental results with very high accuracy.

Feynman diagram and path integral methods are also used in [[statistical mechanics]] and can even be applied to [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |authors=R. Penco, D. Mauro |arxiv=hep-th/0605061 |title=Perturbation theory via Feynman diagrams in classical mechanics |journal=European Journal of Physics |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=1241–1250 |year=2006 |doi=10.1088/0143-0807/27/5/023 |bibcode=2006EJPh...27.1241P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative names ===
[[Murray Gell-Mann]] always referred to Feynman diagrams as '''Stueckelberg diagrams''', after a Swiss physicist, [[Ernst Stueckelberg]], who devised a similar notation many years earlier. Stueckelberg was motivated by the need for a manifestly covariant formalism for quantum field theory, but did not provide as automated a way to handle symmetry factors and loops, although he was first to find the correct physical interpretation in terms of forward and backward in time particle paths, all without the path-integral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=George Johnson |title=The Jaguar and the Fox |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2000/07/johnson.htm |work=The Atlantic |date=July 2000 |access-date=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historically, as a book-keeping device of covariant perturbation theory, the graphs were called '''Feynman–Dyson diagrams''' or '''Dyson graphs''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Gribbin, John and Mary |title=Richard Feynman: A Life in Science |publisher=Penguin-Putnam |year=1997 |chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the path integral was unfamiliar when they were introduced, and [[Freeman Dyson]]'s derivation from old-fashioned perturbation theory was easier to follow for physicists trained in earlier methods.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;"It was Dyson's contribution to indicate how Feynman's visual insights could be used [...] He realized that Feynman diagrams [...] can also be viewed as a representation of the logical content of field theories (as stated in their perturbative expansions)". Schwebber, op.cit (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Feynman had to lobby hard for the diagrams, which confused the establishment physicists trained in equations and graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Leonard |last=Mlodinow |title=Feynman's Rainbow |publisher=Vintage |year=2011 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representation of physical reality ==
In their presentations of [[fundamental interactions]],&lt;ref&gt;Gerardus 't Hooft, Martinus Veltman, ''Diagrammar'', CERN Yellow Report 1973, reprinted in G. 't Hooft, ''Under the Spell of Gauge Principle'' (World Scientific, Singapore, 1994), Introduction [http://preprints.cern.ch/cgi-bin/setlink?base=cernrep&amp;categ=Yellow_Report&amp;id=1973-009 online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martinus Veltman, ''Diagrammatica: The Path to Feynman Diagrams'', Cambridge Lecture Notes in Physics, {{ISBN|0-521-45692-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; written from the particle physics perspective, [[Gerard 't Hooft]] and [[Martinus Veltman]] gave good arguments for taking the original, non-regularized Feynman diagrams as the most succinct representation of our present knowledge about the physics of quantum scattering of [[fundamental particles]]. Their motivations are consistent with the convictions of [[James Daniel Bjorken]] and [[Sidney Drell]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. D. |last=Bjorken |first2=S. D. |last2=Drell |title=Relativistic Quantum Fields |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1965 |page=viii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Feynman graphs and rules of calculation summarize [[quantum field theory]] in a form in close contact with the experimental numbers one wants to understand. Although the statement of the theory in terms of graphs may imply [[perturbation theory]], use of graphical methods in the [[many-body problem]] shows that this formalism is flexible enough to deal with phenomena of nonperturbative characters … Some modification of the [[Feynman rules]] of calculation may well outlive the elaborate mathematical structure of local canonical quantum field theory …&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So far there are no opposing opinions. In [[quantum field theories]] the Feynman diagrams are obtained from [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] by Feynman rules.

[[Dimensional regularization]] is a method for [[regularization (physics)|regularizing]] [[integral]]s in the evaluation of Feynman diagrams; it assigns values to them that are [[meromorphic function]]s of an auxiliary complex parameter {{mvar|d}}, called the dimension.  Dimensional regularization writes a [[Feynman integral]] as an integral depending on the spacetime dimension {{mvar|d}} and spacetime points.

== Particle-path interpretation ==
A Feynman diagram is a representation of quantum field theory processes in terms of [[Elementary particle|particle]] interactions. The particles are represented by the lines of the diagram, which can be squiggly or straight, with an arrow or without, depending on the type of particle. A point where lines connect to other lines is a ''vertex'', and this is where the particles meet and interact: by emitting or absorbing new particles, deflecting one another, or changing type.

There are three different types of lines: ''internal lines'' connect two vertices, ''incoming lines'' extend from "the past" to a vertex and represent an initial state, and ''outgoing lines'' extend from a vertex to "the future" and represent the final state (the latter two are also known as ''external lines''). Traditionally, the bottom of the diagram is the past and the top the future; other times, the past is to the left and the future to the right. When calculating [[correlation functions]] instead of [[scattering amplitude]]s, there is no past and future and all the lines are internal. The particles then begin and end on little x's, which represent the positions of the operators whose correlation is being calculated.

Feynman diagrams are a pictorial representation of a contribution to the total amplitude for a process that can happen in several different ways. When a group of incoming particles are to scatter off each other, the process can be thought of as one where the particles travel over all possible paths, including paths that go backward in time.

Feynman diagrams are often confused with [[spacetime diagram]]s and [[bubble chamber]] images because they all describe particle scattering. Feynman diagrams are [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] that represent the interaction of particles rather than the physical position of the particle during a scattering process. Unlike a bubble chamber picture, only the sum of all the Feynman diagrams represent any given particle interaction; particles do not choose a particular diagram each time they interact. The law of summation is in accord with the [[quantum superposition|principle of superposition]]—every diagram contributes to the total amplitude for the process.

A Feynman diagram represents a perturbative contribution to the amplitude of a quantum transition from some initial quantum state to some final quantum state.

For example, in the process of electron-positron annihilation the initial state is one electron and one positron, the final state: two photons.

The initial state is often assumed to be at the left of the diagram and the final state at the right (although other conventions are also used quite often).

A Feynman diagram consists of points, called vertices, and lines attached to the vertices.

The particles in the initial state are depicted by lines sticking out in the direction of the initial state (e.g., to the left), the particles in the final state are represented by lines sticking out in the direction of the final state (e.g., to the right).

In [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]] there are two types of particles: matter particles such as electrons or positrons (called [[fermions]]) and exchange particles (called [[gauge bosons]]). They are represented in Feynman diagrams as follows:
# Electron in the initial state is represented by a solid line, with an arrow indicating the spin of the particle e.g. pointing toward the vertex (→•).
# Electron in the final state is represented by a line, with an arrow indicating the spin of the particle e.g. pointing away from the vertex: (•→).
# Positron in the initial state is represented by a solid line, with an arrow indicating the spin of the particle e.g. pointing away from the vertex: (←•).
# Positron in the final state is represented by a line, with an arrow indicating the spin of the particle e.g. pointing toward the vertex: (•←).
# Virtual Photon in the initial and the final state is represented by a wavy line (&lt;big&gt;~•&lt;/big&gt; and &lt;big&gt;•~&lt;/big&gt;).

In QED a vertex always has three lines attached to it: one bosonic line, one fermionic line with arrow toward the vertex, and one fermionic line with arrow away from the vertex.

The vertices might be connected by a bosonic or fermionic [[propagator]]. A bosonic propagator is represented by a wavy line connecting two vertices (•~•). A fermionic propagator is represented by a solid line (with an arrow in one or another direction) connecting two vertices, (•←•).

The number of vertices gives the order of the term in the perturbation series expansion of the transition amplitude.

=== Electron–positron annihilation example ===
[[File:Feynman EP Annihilation.svg|thumb|Feynman diagram of electron/positron annihilation]]

The electron–positron annihilation interaction:

:e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2γ

has a contribution from the second order Feynman diagram shown adjacent:

In the initial state (at the bottom; early time) there is one electron (e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and one positron (e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and in the final state (at the top; late time) there are two photons (γ).

== Canonical quantization formulation ==
The [[probability amplitude]] for a transition of a quantum system from the initial state {{math|{{ket|''i''}}}} to the final state {{math|{{ket| ''f'' }}}} is given by the matrix element

:&lt;math&gt;S_{fi}=\langle f|S|i\rangle\;,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|S}} is the [[S-matrix|{{mvar|S}}-matrix]].

In the canonical quantum field theory the {{mvar|S}}-matrix is represented within the [[interaction picture]] by the perturbation series in the powers of the interaction Lagrangian,

:&lt;math&gt;S=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{i^n}{n!}\int\prod_{j=1}^n d^4 x_j T\prod_{j=1}^n L_v\left(x_j\right)\equiv\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}S^{(n)}\;,
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|L&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the interaction Lagrangian and {{mvar|T}} signifies the time-ordered product of operators.

A Feynman diagram is a graphical representation of a term in the [[Wick's theorem|Wick's expansion]] of the time-ordered product in the {{mvar|n}}th order term {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;}} of the {{mvar|S}}-matrix,

:&lt;math&gt;T\prod_{j=1}^nL_v\left(x_j\right)=\sum_{\text{all possible} \atop \text{contractions}}(\pm)N\prod_{j=1}^nL_v\left(x_j\right)\;,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|N}} signifies the [[Normal order|normal-product]] of the operators and (±) takes care of the possible sign change when commuting the fermionic operators to bring them together for a contraction (a [[propagator]]).

=== Feynman rules ===
The diagrams are drawn according to the Feynman rules, which depend upon the interaction Lagrangian. For the [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]] interaction Lagrangian
:&lt;math&gt;L_v=-g\bar\psi\gamma^\mu\psi A_\mu&lt;/math&gt;
describing the interaction of a fermionic field {{mvar|ψ}} with a bosonic gauge field {{mvar|A&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the Feynman rules can be formulated in coordinate space as follows:

# Each integration coordinate {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}} is represented by a point (sometimes called a vertex);
# A bosonic [[propagator]] is represented by a wiggly line connecting two points;
# A fermionic propagator is represented by a solid line connecting two points;
# A bosonic field &lt;math&gt;A_\mu(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; is represented by a wiggly line attached to the point {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}};
# A fermionic field {{math|''ψ''(''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is represented by a solid line attached to the point {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} with an arrow toward the point;
# An anti-fermionic field {{math|{{overline|''ψ''}}(''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is represented by a solid line attached to the point {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} with an arrow away from the point;

=== Example: second order processes in QED ===
The second order perturbation term in the {{mvar|S}}-matrix is

:&lt;math&gt;S^{(2)}=\frac{(ie)^2}{2!}\int d^4x\, d^4x'\, T\bar\psi(x)\,\gamma^\mu\,\psi(x)\,A_\mu(x)\,\bar\psi(x')\,\gamma^\nu\,\psi(x')\,A_\nu(x').\;&lt;/math&gt;

==== Scattering of fermions ====
    {|align="right"
    |[[File:Feynman-diagram-ee-scattering.png|right|thumb|360px|The Feynman diagram of the term &lt;math&gt;N\bar\psi(x)ie\gamma^\mu\psi(x)\bar\psi(x')ie\gamma^\nu\psi(x')A_\mu(x)A_\nu(x')&lt;/math&gt;]]
    |}
The [[Wick's theorem|Wick's expansion]] of the integrand gives (among others) the following term

:&lt;math&gt;N\bar\psi(x)\gamma^\mu\psi(x)\bar\psi(x')\gamma^\nu\psi(x')\underline{A_\mu(x)A_\nu(x')}\;,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{A_\mu(x)A_\nu(x')}=\int\frac{d^4k}{(2\pi)^4}\frac{-ig_{\mu\nu}}{k^2+i0}e^{-ik(x-x')}&lt;/math&gt;

is the electromagnetic contraction (propagator) in the Feynman gauge. This term is represented by the Feynman diagram at the right. This diagram gives contributions to the following processes:
# e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; scattering (initial state at the right, final state at the left of the diagram);
# e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; scattering (initial state at the left, final state at the right of the diagram);
# e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; scattering (initial state at the bottom/top, final state at the top/bottom of the diagram).

==== Compton scattering and annihilation/generation of e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pairs ====
Another interesting term in the expansion is

:&lt;math&gt;N\bar\psi(x)\,\gamma^\mu\,\underline{\psi(x)\,\bar\psi(x')}\,\gamma^\nu\,\psi(x')\,A_\mu(x)\,A_\nu(x')\;,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{\psi(x)\bar\psi(x')}=\int\frac{d^4p}{(2\pi)^4}\frac{i}{\gamma p-m+i0}e^{-ip(x-x')}&lt;/math&gt;

is the fermionic contraction (propagator).

== Path integral formulation ==
In a [[path integral formulation|path integral]], the field Lagrangian, integrated over all possible field histories, defines the probability amplitude to go from one field configuration to another. In order to make sense, the field theory should have a well-defined [[ground state]], and the integral should be performed a little bit rotated into imaginary time, i.e. a [[Wick rotation]].

=== Scalar field Lagrangian ===
A simple example is the free relativistic scalar field in {{mvar|d}} dimensions, whose action integral is:
:&lt;math&gt; S = \int \tfrac12 \partial_\mu \phi \partial^\mu \phi\, d^dx \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The probability amplitude for a process is:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_A^B e^{iS}\, D\phi\,, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are space-like hypersurfaces that define the boundary conditions. The collection of all the {{math|''φ''(''A'')}} on the starting hypersurface give the initial value of the field, analogous to the starting position for a point particle, and the field values {{math|''φ''(''B'')}} at each point of the final hypersurface defines the final field value, which is allowed to vary, giving a different amplitude to end up at different values. This is the field-to-field transition amplitude.

The path integral gives the expectation value of operators between the initial and final state:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_A^B e^{iS} \phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n) \,D\phi = \left\langle A\left| \phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n) \right|B \right\rangle\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and in the limit that A and B recede to the infinite past and the infinite future, the only contribution that matters is from the ground state (this is only rigorously true if the path-integral is defined slightly rotated into imaginary time). The path integral can be thought of as analogous to a probability distribution, and it is convenient to define it so that multiplying by a constant doesn't change anything:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\displaystyle\int e^{iS} \phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n) \,D\phi }{ \displaystyle\int e^{iS} \,D\phi } = \left\langle 0 \left| \phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n) \right|0\right\rangle \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The normalization factor on the bottom is called the ''partition function'' for the field, and it coincides with the statistical mechanical partition function at zero temperature when rotated into imaginary time.

The initial-to-final amplitudes are ill-defined if one thinks of the continuum limit right from the beginning, because the fluctuations in the field can become unbounded. So the path-integral can be thought of as on a discrete square lattice, with lattice spacing {{mvar|a}} and the limit {{math|''a'' → 0}} should be taken carefully{{clarify|date=May 2016}}. If the final results do not depend on the shape of the lattice or the value of {{mvar|a}}, then the continuum limit exists.

=== On a lattice ===
On a lattice, (i), the field can be expanded in [[Fourier series|Fourier modes]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x) = \int \frac{dk}{(2\pi)^d} \phi(k) e^{ik\cdot x} = \int_k \phi(k) e^{ikx}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the integration domain is over {{mvar|k}} restricted to a cube of side length {{math|{{sfrac|2π|''a''}}}}, so that large values of {{mvar|k}} are not allowed. It is important to note that the {{mvar|k}}-measure contains the factors of 2{{pi}} from Fourier transforms, this is the best standard convention for {{mvar|k}}-integrals in QFT. The lattice means that fluctuations at large {{mvar|k}} are not allowed to contribute right away, they only start to contribute in the limit {{math|''a'' → 0}}. Sometimes, instead of a lattice, the field modes are just cut off at high values of {{mvar|k}} instead.

It is also convenient from time to time to consider the space-time volume to be finite, so that the {{mvar|k}} modes are also a lattice. This is not strictly as necessary as the space-lattice limit, because interactions in {{mvar|k}} are not localized, but it is convenient for keeping track of the factors in front of the {{mvar|k}}-integrals and the momentum-conserving delta functions that will arise.

On a lattice, (ii), the action needs to be discretized:
:&lt;math&gt; S= \sum_{\langle x,y\rangle} \tfrac12 \big(\phi(x) - \phi(y) \big)^2\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|{{angbr|''x'',''y''}}}} is a pair of nearest lattice neighbors {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}. The discretization should be thought of as defining what the derivative {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;''φ''}} means.

In terms of the lattice Fourier modes, the action can be written:
:&lt;math&gt;S= \int_k \Big( \big(1-\cos(k_1)\big) +\big(1-\cos(k_2)\big) + \cdots + \big(1-\cos(k_d)\big) \Big)\phi^*_k \phi^k\,.&lt;/math&gt;
For {{mvar|k}} near zero this is:
:&lt;math&gt;S = \int_k \tfrac12 k^2 \left|\phi(k)\right|^2\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Now we have the continuum Fourier transform of the original action. In finite volume, the quantity {{mvar|d&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;k}} is not infinitesimal, but becomes the volume of a box made by neighboring Fourier modes, or {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{sfrac|2π|''V''}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''d''|b=&amp;nbsp;}}}}.

The field {{mvar|φ}} is real-valued, so the Fourier transform obeys:

:&lt;math&gt; \phi(k)^* = \phi(-k)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of real and imaginary parts, the real part of {{math|''φ''(''k'')}} is an [[even function]] of {{mvar|k}}, while the imaginary part is odd. The Fourier transform avoids double-counting, so that it can be written:

:&lt;math&gt; S = \int_k \tfrac12 k^2 \phi(k) \phi(-k)&lt;/math&gt;

over an integration domain that integrates over each pair {{math|(''k'',−''k'')}} exactly once.

For a complex scalar field with action

:&lt;math&gt; S = \int \tfrac12 \partial_\mu\phi^* \partial^\mu\phi \,d^dx&lt;/math&gt;

the Fourier transform is unconstrained:

:&lt;math&gt; S = \int_k \tfrac12 k^2 \left|\phi(k)\right|^2&lt;/math&gt;

and the integral is over all {{mvar|k}}.

Integrating over all different values of {{math|''φ''(''x'')}} is equivalent to integrating over all Fourier modes, because taking a Fourier transform is a unitary linear transformation of field coordinates. When you change coordinates in a multidimensional integral by a linear transformation, the value of the new integral is given by the determinant of the transformation matrix. If
:&lt;math&gt; y_i = A_{ij} x_j\,,&lt;/math&gt;

then
:&lt;math&gt;\det(A) \int dx_1\, dx_2 \cdots\, dx_n = \int dy_1\, dy_2 \cdots\, dy_n\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{mvar|A}} is a rotation, then
:&lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{T} A = I&lt;/math&gt;
so that {{math|det ''A'' {{=}} ±1}}, and the sign depends on whether the rotation includes a reflection or not.

The matrix that changes coordinates from {{math|''φ''(''x'')}} to {{math|''φ''(''k'')}} can be read off from the definition of a Fourier transform.

:&lt;math&gt; A_{kx} = e^{ikx} \,&lt;/math&gt;

and the Fourier inversion theorem tells you the inverse:

:&lt;math&gt; A^{-1}_{kx} = e^{-ikx} \,&lt;/math&gt;

which is the complex conjugate-transpose, up to factors of 2{{pi}}. On a finite volume lattice, the determinant is nonzero and independent of the field values.
:&lt;math&gt; \det A = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

and the path integral is a separate factor at each value of {{mvar|k}}.

:&lt;math&gt; \int \exp \left(\frac{i}{2} \sum_k k^2 \phi^*(k) \phi(k) \right)\, D\phi = \prod_k \int_{\phi_k} e^{\frac{i}{2} k^2 \left|\phi_k \right|^2\, d^dk} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The factor {{mvar|d&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;k}} is the infinitesimal volume of a discrete cell in {{mvar|k}}-space, in a square lattice box
:&lt;math&gt;d^dk = \left(\frac{1}{L}\right)^d\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|L}} is the side-length of the box. Each separate factor is an oscillatory Gaussian, and the width of the Gaussian diverges as the volume goes to infinity.

In imaginary time, the ''Euclidean action'' becomes positive definite, and can be interpreted as a probability distribution. The probability of a field having values {{mvar|φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} is
:&lt;math&gt; e^{\int_k - \tfrac12 k^2 \phi^*_k \phi_k} = \prod_k e^{- k^2 \left|\phi_k\right|^2\, d^dk}\,. &lt;/math&gt;

The expectation value of the field is the statistical expectation value of the field when chosen according to the probability distribution:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n) \right\rangle = \frac{ \displaystyle\int e^{-S} \phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n)\, D\phi} {\displaystyle\int e^{-S}\, D\phi}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the probability of {{mvar|φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a product, the value of {{mvar|φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} at each separate value of {{mvar|k}} is independently Gaussian distributed. The variance of the Gaussian is {{math|{{sfrac|1|''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''d&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;k''}}}}, which is formally infinite, but that just means that the fluctuations are unbounded in infinite volume. In any finite volume, the integral is replaced by a discrete sum, and the variance of the integral is {{math|{{sfrac|''V''|''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}.

=== Monte Carlo ===
The path integral defines a probabilistic algorithm to generate a Euclidean scalar field configuration. Randomly pick the real and imaginary parts of each Fourier mode at wavenumber {{mvar|k}} to be a Gaussian random variable with variance {{math|{{sfrac|1|''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}. This generates a configuration {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''(''k'')}} at random, and the Fourier transform gives {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')}}. For real scalar fields, the algorithm must generate only one of each pair {{math|''φ''(''k''), ''φ''(−''k'')}}, and make the second the complex conjugate of the first.

To find any correlation function, generate a field again and again by this procedure, and find the statistical average:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle \phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n) \right\rangle = \lim_{|C|\rightarrow\infty}\frac{ \displaystyle\sum_C \phi_C(x_1) \cdots \phi_C(x_n) }{|C| } &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|{{abs|''C''}}}} is the number of configurations, and the sum is of the product of the field values on each configuration. The Euclidean correlation function is just the same as the correlation function in statistics or statistical mechanics. The quantum mechanical correlation functions are an analytic continuation of the Euclidean correlation functions.

For free fields with a quadratic action, the probability distribution is a high-dimensional Gaussian, and the statistical average is given by an explicit formula. But the [[Monte Carlo method]] also works well for bosonic interacting field theories where there is no closed form for the correlation functions.

=== Scalar propagator ===
Each mode is independently Gaussian distributed. The expectation of field modes is easy to calculate:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle \phi_k \phi_{k'}\right\rangle = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

for {{math|''k'' ≠ ''k''′}}, since then the two Gaussian random variables are independent and both have zero mean.

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\phi_k \phi_k \right\rangle = \frac{V}{k^2} &lt;/math&gt;

in finite volume {{mvar|V}}, when the two {{mvar|k}}-values coincide, since this is the variance of the Gaussian. In the infinite volume limit,

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\phi(k) \phi(k')\right\rangle = \delta(k-k') \frac{1}{k^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Strictly speaking, this is an approximation: the lattice propagator is:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\phi(k) \phi(k')\right\rangle = \delta(k-k') \frac{1}{2\big(d - \cos(k_1) + \cos(k_2) \cdots + \cos(k_d)\big) }&lt;/math&gt;

But near {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}}, for field fluctuations long compared to the lattice spacing, the two forms coincide.

It is important to emphasize that the delta functions contain factors of 2{{pi}}, so that they cancel out the 2{{pi}} factors in the measure for {{mvar|k}} integrals.

:&lt;math&gt;\delta(k) = (2\pi)^d \delta_D(k_1)\delta_D(k_2) \cdots \delta_D(k_d) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''δ&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''(''k'')}} is the ordinary one-dimensional Dirac delta function. This convention for delta-functions is not universal—some authors keep the factors of 2{{pi}} in the delta functions (and in the {{mvar|k}}-integration) explicit.

=== Equation of motion ===
The form of the propagator can be more easily found by using the equation of motion for the field. From the Lagrangian, the equation of motion is:

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_\mu \partial^\mu \phi = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

and in an expectation value, this says:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu\partial^\mu \left\langle \phi(x) \phi(y)\right\rangle =0&lt;/math&gt;

Where the derivatives act on {{mvar|x}}, and the identity is true everywhere except when {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} coincide, and the operator order matters. The form of the singularity can be understood from the canonical commutation relations to be a delta-function. Defining the (Euclidean) ''Feynman propagator'' {{math|Δ}} as the Fourier transform of the time-ordered two-point function (the one that comes from the path-integral):

:&lt;math&gt; \partial^2 \Delta (x) = i\delta(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

So that:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(k) = \frac{i}{k^2}&lt;/math&gt;

If the equations of motion are linear, the propagator will always be the reciprocal of the quadratic-form matrix that defines the free Lagrangian, since this gives the equations of motion. This is also easy to see directly from the path integral. The factor of {{mvar|i}} disappears in the Euclidean theory.

==== Wick theorem ====
{{Main article|Wick's theorem}}
Because each field mode is an independent Gaussian, the expectation values for the product of many field modes obeys ''Wick's theorem'':

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle \phi(k_1) \phi(k_2) \cdots \phi(k_n)\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

is zero unless the field modes coincide in pairs. This means that it is zero for an odd number of {{mvar|φ}}, and for an even number of {{mvar|φ}}, it is equal to a contribution from each pair separately, with a delta function.

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \phi(k_1) \cdots \phi(k_{2n})\right\rangle = \sum \prod_{i,j} \frac{\delta\left(k_i - k_j\right) }{k_i^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is over each partition of the field modes into pairs, and the product is over the pairs. For example,

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle \phi(k_1) \phi(k_2) \phi(k_3) \phi(k_4) \right\rangle = \frac{\delta(k_1 -k_2)}{k_1^2}\frac{\delta(k_3-k_4)}{k_3^2} + \frac{\delta(k_1-k_3)}{k_3^2}\frac{\delta(k_2-k_4)}{k_2^2} + \frac{\delta(k_1-k_4)}{k_1^2}\frac{\delta(k_2 -k_3)}{k_2^2}&lt;/math&gt;

An interpretation of Wick's theorem is that each field insertion can be thought of as a dangling line, and the expectation value is calculated by linking up the lines in pairs, putting a delta function factor that ensures that the momentum of each partner in the pair is equal, and dividing by the propagator.

==== Higher Gaussian moments — completing Wick's theorem ====
There is a subtle point left before Wick's theorem is proved—what if more than two of the phis have the same momentum? If it's an odd number, the integral is zero; negative values cancel with the positive values. But if the number is even, the integral is positive. The previous demonstration assumed that the phis would only match up in pairs.

But the theorem is correct even when arbitrarily many of the {{mvar|φ}} are equal, and this is a notable property of Gaussian integration:
:&lt;math&gt; I = \int e^{-ax^2/2}dx = \sqrt\frac{2\pi}{a} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^n}{\partial a^n } I = \int \frac{x^{2n}}{2^n} e^{-ax^2/2}dx = \frac{1\cdot 3 \cdot 5 \ldots \cdot (2n-1) }{ 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \ldots \;\;\;\;\;\cdot 2\;\;\;\;\;\;} \sqrt{2\pi}\, a^{-\frac{2n+1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by {{mvar|I}},

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle x^{2n}\right\rangle=\frac{\displaystyle\int x^{2n} e^{-a x^2/2} }{\displaystyle \int e^{-a x^2/2} } = 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \ldots \cdot (2n-1) \frac{1}{a^n} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle x^2 \right\rangle = \frac{1}{a} &lt;/math&gt;

If Wick's theorem were correct, the higher moments would be given by all possible pairings of a list of {{math|2''n''}} different {{mvar|x}}:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle x_1 x_2 x_3 \cdots x_{2n} \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{mvar|x}} are all the same variable, the index is just to keep track of the number of ways to pair them. The first {{mvar|x}} can be paired with {{math|2''n'' − 1}} others, leaving {{math|2''n'' − 2}}. The next unpaired {{mvar|x}} can be paired with {{math|2''n'' − 3}} different {{mvar|x}} leaving {{math|2''n'' − 4}}, and so on. This means that Wick's theorem, uncorrected, says that the expectation value of {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} should be:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle x^{2n} \right\rangle = (2n-1)\cdot(2n-3)\ldots \cdot5 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 \left\langle x^2\right\rangle^n &lt;/math&gt;

and this is in fact the correct answer. So Wick's theorem holds no matter how many of the momenta of the internal variables coincide.

==== Interaction ====
Interactions are represented by higher order contributions, since quadratic contributions are always Gaussian. The simplest interaction is the quartic self-interaction, with an action:

:&lt;math&gt; S = \int \partial^\mu \phi \partial_\mu\phi +\frac {\lambda}{ 4!} \phi^4. &lt;/math&gt;

The reason for the combinatorial factor 4! will be clear soon. Writing the action in terms of the lattice (or continuum) Fourier modes:

:&lt;math&gt; S = \int_k k^2 \left|\phi(k)\right|^2 + \int_{k_1k_2k_3k_4} \phi(k_1) \phi(k_2) \phi(k_3)\phi(k_4) \delta(k_1+k_2+k_3 + k_4) = S_F + X. &lt;/math&gt;

Where {{mvar|S&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the free action, whose correlation functions are given by Wick's theorem. The exponential of {{mvar|S}} in the path integral can be expanded in powers of {{mvar|λ}}, giving a series of corrections to the free action.

:&lt;math&gt; e^{-S} = e^{-S_F} \left( 1 + X + \frac{1}{2!} X X + \frac{1}{3!} X X X + \cdots \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The path integral for the interacting action is then a power series of corrections to the free action. The term represented by {{mvar|X}} should be thought of as four half-lines, one for each factor of {{math|''φ''(''k'')}}. The half-lines meet at a vertex, which contributes a delta-function that ensures that the sum of the momenta are all equal.

To compute a correlation function in the interacting theory, there is a contribution from the {{mvar|X}} terms now. For example, the path-integral for the four-field correlator:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \phi(k_1) \phi(k_2) \phi(k_3) \phi(k_4) \right\rangle = \frac{\displaystyle\int e^{-S} \phi(k_1)\phi(k_2)\phi(k_3)\phi(k_4) D\phi }{ Z}&lt;/math&gt;

which in the free field was only nonzero when the momenta {{mvar|k}} were equal in pairs, is now nonzero for all values of {{mvar|k}}. The momenta of the insertions {{math|''φ''(''k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} can now match up with the momenta of the {{mvar|X}}s in the expansion. The insertions should also be thought of as half-lines, four in this case, which carry a momentum {{mvar|k}}, but one that is not integrated.

The lowest-order contribution comes from the first nontrivial term {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''S&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sup&gt;''X''}} in the Taylor expansion of the action. Wick's theorem requires that the momenta in the {{mvar|X}} half-lines, the {{math|''φ''(''k'')}} factors in {{math|X}}, should match up with the momenta of the external half-lines in pairs. The new contribution is equal to:

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda \frac{1}{ k_1^2} \frac{1}{ k_2^2} \frac{1}{ k_3^2} \frac{1}{ k_4^2}\,. &lt;/math&gt;

The 4! inside {{math|X}} is canceled because there are exactly 4! ways to match the half-lines in {{mvar|X}} to the external half-lines. Each of these different ways of matching the half-lines together in pairs contributes exactly once, regardless of the values of {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;1,2,3,4&lt;/sub&gt;}}, by Wick's theorem.

==== Feynman diagrams ====
The expansion of the action in powers of {{mvar|X}} gives a series of terms with progressively higher number of {{mvar|X}}s. The contribution from the term with exactly {{mvar|n}} {{mvar|X}}s is called {{mvar|n}}th order.

The {{mvar|n}}th order terms has:
# {{math|4''n''}} internal half-lines, which are the factors of {{math|''φ''(''k'')}} from the {{mvar|X}}s. These all end on a vertex, and are integrated over all possible {{mvar|k}}.
# external half-lines, which are the come from the {{math|''φ''(''k'')}} insertions in the integral.

By Wick's theorem, each pair of half-lines must be paired together to make a ''line'', and this line gives a factor of

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta(k_1 + k_2)}{k_1^2} &lt;/math&gt;

which multiplies the contribution. This means that the two half-lines that make a line are forced to have equal and opposite momentum. The line itself should be labelled by an arrow, drawn parallel to the line, and labeled by the momentum in the line {{mvar|k}}. The half-line at the tail end of the arrow carries momentum {{mvar|k}}, while the half-line at the head-end carries momentum {{mvar|−''k''}}. If one of the two half-lines is external, this kills the integral over the internal {{mvar|k}}, since it forces the internal {{mvar|k}} to be equal to the external {{mvar|k}}. If both are internal, the integral over {{mvar|k}} remains.

The diagrams that are formed by linking the half-lines in the {{mvar|X}}s with the external half-lines, representing insertions, are the Feynman diagrams of this theory. Each line carries a factor of {{math|{{sfrac|1|''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}, the propagator, and either goes from vertex to vertex, or ends at an insertion. If it is internal, it is integrated over. At each vertex, the total incoming {{mvar|k}} is equal to the total outgoing {{mvar|k}}.

The number of ways of making a diagram by joining half-lines into lines almost completely cancels the factorial factors coming from the Taylor series of the exponential and the 4! at each vertex.

==== Loop order ====
A forest diagram is one where all the internal lines have momentum that is completely determined by the external lines and the condition that the incoming and outgoing momentum are equal at each vertex. The contribution of these diagrams is a product of propagators, without any integration. A tree diagram is a connected forest diagram.

An example of a tree diagram is the one where each of four external lines end on an {{mvar|X}}. Another is when three external lines end on an {{mvar|X}}, and the remaining half-line joins up with another {{mvar|X}}, and the remaining half-lines of this {{mvar|X}} run off to external lines. These are all also forest diagrams (as every tree is a forest); an example of a forest that is not a tree is when eight external lines end on two {{mvar|X}}s.

It is easy to verify that in all these cases, the momenta on all the internal lines is determined by the external momenta and the condition of momentum conservation in each vertex.

A diagram that is not a forest diagram is called a ''loop'' diagram, and an example is one where two lines of an {{mvar|X}} are joined to external lines, while the remaining two lines are joined to each other. The two lines joined to each other can have any momentum at all, since they both enter and leave the same vertex. A more complicated example is one where two {{mvar|X}}s are joined to each other by matching the legs one to the other. This diagram has no external lines at all.

The reason loop diagrams are called loop diagrams is because the number of {{mvar|k}}-integrals that are left undetermined by momentum conservation is equal to the number of independent closed loops in the diagram, where independent loops are counted as in [[homology theory]]. The homology is real-valued (actually {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;}} valued), the value associated with each line is the momentum. The boundary operator takes each line to the sum of the end-vertices with a positive sign at the head and a negative sign at the tail. The condition that the momentum is conserved is exactly the condition that the boundary of the {{mvar|k}}-valued weighted graph is zero.

A set of valid {{mvar|k}}-values can be arbitrarily redefined whenever there is a closed loop. A closed loop is a cyclical path of adjacent vertices that never revisits the same vertex. Such a cycle can be thought of as the boundary of a hypothetical 2-cell. The {{mvar|k}}-labellings of a graph that conserve momentum (i.e. which has zero boundary) up to redefinitions of {{mvar|k}} (i.e. up to boundaries of 2-cells) define the first homology of a graph. The number of independent momenta that are not determined is then equal to the number of independent homology loops. For many graphs, this is equal to the number of loops as counted in the most intuitive way.

==== Symmetry factors ====
The number of ways to form a given Feynman diagram by joining together half-lines is large, and by Wick's theorem, each way of pairing up the half-lines contributes equally. Often, this completely cancels the factorials in the denominator of each term, but the cancellation is sometimes incomplete.

The uncancelled denominator is called the ''symmetry factor'' of the diagram. The contribution of each diagram to the correlation function must be divided by its symmetry factor.

For example, consider the Feynman diagram formed from two external lines joined to one {{mvar|X}}, and the remaining two half-lines in the {{mvar|X}} joined to each other. There are 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3 ways to join the external half-lines to the {{mvar|X}}, and then there is only one way to join the two remaining lines to each other. The {{mvar|X}} comes divided by {{nowrap|4! {{=}} 4 × 3 × 2}}, but the number of ways to link up the {{mvar|X}} half lines to make the diagram is only 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3, so the contribution of this diagram is divided by two.

For another example, consider the diagram formed by joining all the half-lines of one {{mvar|X}} to all the half-lines of another {{mvar|X}}. This diagram is called a ''vacuum bubble'', because it does not link up to any external lines. There are 4! ways to form this diagram, but the denominator includes a 2! (from the expansion of the exponential, there are two {{mvar|X}}s) and two factors of 4!. The contribution is multiplied by {{sfrac|4!|2 × 4! × 4!}} =&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|48}}.

Another example is the Feynman diagram formed from two {{mvar|X}}s where each {{mvar|X}} links up to two external lines, and the remaining two half-lines of each {{mvar|X}} are joined to each other. The number of ways to link an {{mvar|X}} to two external lines is 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3, and either {{mvar|X}} could link up to either pair, giving an additional factor of 2. The remaining two half-lines in the two {{mvar|X}}s can be linked to each other in two ways, so that the total number of ways to form the diagram is {{nowrap|4 × 3 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 2}}, while the denominator is {{nowrap|4! × 4! × 2!}}. The total symmetry factor is 2, and the contribution of this diagram is divided by 2.

The symmetry factor theorem gives the symmetry factor for a general diagram: the contribution of each Feynman diagram must be divided by the order of its group of automorphisms, the number of symmetries that it has.

An [[automorphism]] of a Feynman graph is a permutation {{mvar|M}} of the lines and a permutation {{mvar|N}} of the vertices with the following properties:

# If a line {{mvar|l}} goes from vertex {{mvar|v}} to vertex {{mvar|v′}}, then {{math|''M''(''l'')}} goes from {{math|''N''(''v'')}} to {{math|''N''(''v′'')}}. If the line is undirected, as it is for a real scalar field, then {{math|''M''(''l'')}} can go from {{math|''N''(''v′'')}} to {{math|''N''(''v'')}} too.
# If a line {{mvar|l}} ends on an external line, {{math|''M''(''l'')}} ends on the same external line.
# If there are different types of lines, {{math|''M''(''l'')}} should preserve the type.

This theorem has an interpretation in terms of particle-paths: when identical particles are present, the integral over all intermediate particles must not double-count states that differ only by interchanging identical particles.

Proof: To prove this theorem, label all the internal and external lines of a diagram with a unique name. Then form the diagram by linking a half-line to a name and then to the other half line.

Now count the number of ways to form the named diagram. Each permutation of the {{mvar|X}}s gives a different pattern of linking names to half-lines, and this is a factor of {{math|''n''!}}. Each permutation of the half-lines in a single {{mvar|X}} gives a factor of 4!. So a named diagram can be formed in exactly as many ways as the denominator of the Feynman expansion.

But the number of unnamed diagrams is smaller than the number of named diagram by the order of the automorphism group of the graph.

==== Connected diagrams: ''linked-cluster theorem'' ====
Roughly speaking, a Feynman diagram is called ''connected'' if all vertices and propagator lines are linked by a sequence of vertices and propagators of the diagram itself. If one views it as an [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|undirected graph]] it is connected. The remarkable relevance of such diagrams in QFTs is due to the fact that they are sufficient to determine the [[Partition function (quantum field theory)|quantum partition function]] {{math|''Z''[''J'']}}. More precisely, connected Feynman diagrams determine

:&lt;math&gt;i W[J]\equiv \ln Z[J].&lt;/math&gt;

To see this, one should recall that

:&lt;math&gt; Z[J]\propto\sum_k{D_k}&lt;/math&gt;

with {{mvar|D&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} constructed from some (arbitrary) Feynman diagram that can be thought to consist of several connected components {{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If one encounters {{mvar|n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} (identical) copies of a component {{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} within the Feynman diagram {{mvar|D&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} one has to include a ''symmetry factor'' {{mvar|''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''!}}. However, in the end each contribution of a Feynman diagram {{mvar|D&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} to the partition function has the generic form

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_i \frac{C_{i}^{n_i} }{ n_i!} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|i}} labels the (infinitely) many connected Feynman diagrams possible.

A scheme to successively create such contributions from the {{mvar|D&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''Z''[''J'']}} is obtained by

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{1}{0!}+\frac{C_1}{1!}+\frac{C^2_1}{2!}+\cdots\right)\left(1+C_2+\frac{1}{2}C^2_2+\cdots\right)\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

and therefore yields

:&lt;math&gt;Z[J]\propto\prod_i{\sum^\infty_{n_i=0}{\frac{C_i^{n_i}}{n_i!}}}=\exp{\sum_i{C_i}}\propto \exp{W[J]}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

To establish the ''normalization'' {{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} exp ''W''[0] {{=}} 1}} one simply calculates all connected ''vacuum diagrams'', i.e., the diagrams without any ''sources'' {{mvar|J}} (sometimes referred to as ''external legs'' of a Feynman diagram).

==== Vacuum bubbles ====
An immediate consequence of the linked-cluster theorem is that all vacuum bubbles, diagrams without external lines, cancel when calculating correlation functions. A correlation function is given by a ratio of path-integrals:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle \phi_1(x_1) \cdots \phi_n(x_n)\right\rangle = \frac{\displaystyle\int e^{-S} \phi_1(x_1) \cdots\phi_n(x_n)\, D\phi }{\displaystyle \int e^{-S}\, D\phi}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The top is the sum over all Feynman diagrams, including disconnected diagrams that do not link up to external lines at all. In terms of the connected diagrams, the numerator includes the same contributions of vacuum bubbles as the denominator:

:&lt;math&gt; \int e^{-S}\phi_1(x_1)\cdots\phi_n(x_n)\, D\phi = \left(\sum E_i\right)\left( \exp\left(\sum_i C_i\right) \right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Where the sum over {{mvar|E}} diagrams includes only those diagrams each of whose connected components end on at least one external line. The vacuum bubbles are the same whatever the external lines, and give an overall multiplicative factor. The denominator is the sum over all vacuum bubbles, and dividing gets rid of the second factor.

The vacuum bubbles then are only useful for determining {{mvar|Z}} itself, which from the definition of the path integral is equal to:

:&lt;math&gt; Z= \int e^{-S} D\phi = e^{-HT} = e^{-\rho V} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|ρ}} is the energy density in the vacuum. Each vacuum bubble contains a factor of {{math|''δ''(''k'')}} zeroing the total {{mvar|k}} at each vertex, and when there are no external lines, this contains a factor of {{math|''δ''(0)}}, because the momentum conservation is over-enforced. In finite volume, this factor can be identified as the total volume of space time. Dividing by the volume, the remaining integral for the vacuum bubble has an interpretation: it is a contribution to the energy density of the vacuum.

==== Sources ====
Correlation functions are the sum of the connected Feynman diagrams, but the formalism treats the connected and disconnected diagrams differently. Internal lines end on vertices, while external lines go off to insertions. Introducing ''sources'' unifies the formalism, by making new vertices where one line can end.

Sources are external fields, fields that contribute to the action, but are not dynamical variables. A scalar field source is another scalar field {{mvar|h}} that contributes a term to the (Lorentz) Lagrangian:

:&lt;math&gt; \int h(x) \phi(x)\, d^dx = \int h(k) \phi(k)\, d^dk \,&lt;/math&gt;

In the Feynman expansion, this contributes H terms with one half-line ending on a vertex. Lines in a Feynman diagram can now end either on an {{mvar|X}} vertex, or on an {{mvar|H}} vertex, and only one line enters an {{mvar|H}} vertex. The Feynman rule for an {{mvar|H}} vertex is that a line from an {{mvar|H}} with momentum {{mvar|k}} gets a factor of {{math|''h''(''k'')}}.

The sum of the connected diagrams in the presence of sources includes a term for each connected diagram in the absence of sources, except now the diagrams can end on the source. Traditionally, a source is represented by a little "×" with one line extending out, exactly as an insertion.

:&lt;math&gt; \log\big(Z[h]\big) = \sum_{n,C} h(k_1) h(k_2) \cdots h(k_n) C(k_1,\cdots,k_n)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''C''(''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is the connected diagram with {{mvar|n}} external lines carrying momentum as indicated. The sum is over all connected diagrams, as before.

The field {{mvar|h}} is not dynamical, which means that there is no path integral over {{mvar|h}}: {{mvar|h}} is just a parameter in the Lagrangian, which varies from point to point. The path integral for the field is:

:&lt;math&gt; Z[h] = \int e^{iS + i\int h\phi}\, D\phi \,&lt;/math&gt;

and it is a function of the values of {{mvar|h}} at every point. One way to interpret this expression is that it is taking the Fourier transform in field space. If there is a probability density on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the Fourier transform of the probability density is:

:&lt;math&gt; \int \rho(y) e^{i k y}\, d^n y = \left\langle e^{i k y} \right\rangle = \left\langle \prod_{i=1}^{n} e^{ih_i y_i}\right\rangle \,&lt;/math&gt;

The Fourier transform is the expectation of an oscillatory exponential. The path integral in the presence of a source {{mvar|''h''(''x'')}} is:

:&lt;math&gt; Z[h] = \int e^{iS} e^{i\int_x h(x)\phi(x)}\, D\phi = \left\langle e^{i h \phi }\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

which, on a lattice, is the product of an oscillatory exponential for each field value:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle \prod_x e^{i h_x \phi_x}\right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

The fourier transform of a delta-function is a constant, which gives a formal expression for a delta function:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta(x-y) = \int e^{ik(x-y)}\, dk &lt;/math&gt;

This tells you what a field delta function looks like in a path-integral. For two scalar fields {{mvar|φ}} and {{mvar|η}},

:&lt;math&gt; \delta(\phi - \eta) = \int e^{ i h(x)\big(\phi(x) -\eta(x)\big)\,d^dx}\, Dh\,, &lt;/math&gt;

which integrates over the Fourier transform coordinate, over {{mvar|h}}. This expression is useful for formally changing field coordinates in the path integral, much as a delta function is used to change coordinates in an ordinary multi-dimensional integral.

The partition function is now a function of the field {{mvar|h}}, and the physical partition function is the value when {{mvar|h}} is the zero function:

The correlation functions are derivatives of the path integral with respect to the source:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\phi(x)\right\rangle = \frac{1}{Z} \frac{\partial}{\partial h(x)} Z[h] = \frac{\partial}{\partial h(x)} \log\big(Z[h]\big)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In Euclidean space, source contributions to the action can still appear with a factor of {{mvar|i}}, so that they still do a Fourier transform.

=== Spin {{sfrac|1|2}}; "photons" and "ghosts" ===

==== Spin {{sfrac|1|2}}: Grassmann integrals ====
The field path integral can be extended to the Fermi case, but only if the notion of integration is expanded. A [[Berezin integral|Grassmann integral]] of a free Fermi field is a high-dimensional [[determinant]] or [[Pfaffian]], which defines the new type of Gaussian integration appropriate for Fermi fields.

The two fundamental formulas of Grassmann integration are:

:&lt;math&gt; \int e^{M_{ij}{\bar\psi}^i \psi^j}\, D\bar\psi\, D\psi= \mathrm{Det}(M)\,, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|M}} is an arbitrary matrix and {{math|''ψ'', {{overline|''ψ''}}}} are independent Grassmann variables for each index {{mvar|i}}, and

:&lt;math&gt; \int e^{\frac12 A_{ij} \psi^i \psi^j}\, D\psi = \mathrm{Pfaff}(A)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|A}} is an antisymmetric matrix, {{mvar|ψ}} is a collection of Grassmann variables, and the {{sfrac|1|2}} is to prevent double-counting (since {{math|''ψ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;ψ&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} −''ψ&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;ψ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}}).

In matrix notation, where {{mvar|{{overline|ψ}}}} and {{mvar|{{overline|η}}}} are Grassmann-valued row vectors, {{mvar|η}} and {{mvar|ψ}} are Grassmann-valued column vectors, and {{mvar|M}} is a real-valued matrix:

:&lt;math&gt; Z = \int e^{\bar\psi M \psi + \bar\eta \psi + \bar\psi \eta}\, D\bar\psi\, D\psi = \int e^{\left(\bar\psi+\bar\eta M^{-1}\right)M \left(\psi+ M^{-1}\eta\right) - \bar\eta M^{-1}\eta}\, D\bar\psi\, D\psi = \mathrm{Det}(M) e^{-\bar\eta M^{-1}\eta}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the last equality is a consequence of the translation invariance of the Grassmann integral. The Grassmann variables {{mvar|η}} are external sources for {{mvar|ψ}}, and differentiating with respect to {{mvar|η}} pulls down factors of {{mvar|{{overline|ψ}}}}.

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\bar\psi \psi\right\rangle = \frac{1}{Z} \frac{\partial}{\partial \eta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar\eta} Z |_{\eta=\bar\eta=0} = M^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

again, in a schematic matrix notation. The meaning of the formula above is that the derivative with respect to the appropriate component of {{mvar|η}} and {{mvar|{{overline|η}}}} gives the matrix element of {{math|''M''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This is exactly analogous to the bosonic path integration formula for a Gaussian integral of a complex bosonic field:

:&lt;math&gt; \int e^{\phi^* M \phi + h^* \phi + \phi^* h } \,D\phi^*\, D\phi = \frac{e^{h^* M^{-1} h} }{ \mathrm{Det}(M)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\phi^* \phi\right\rangle = \frac{1}{Z} \frac{\partial}{\partial h} \frac{\partial}{\partial h^*}Z |_{h=h^*=0} = M^{-1} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

So that the propagator is the inverse of the matrix in the quadratic part of the action in both the Bose and Fermi case.

For real Grassmann fields, for [[Majorana fermion]]s, the path integral a Pfaffian times a source quadratic form, and the formulas give the square root of the determinant, just as they do for real Bosonic fields. The propagator is still the inverse of the quadratic part.

The free Dirac Lagrangian:

:&lt;math&gt; \int \bar\psi\left(\gamma^\mu \partial_{\mu} - m \right) \psi &lt;/math&gt;

formally gives the equations of motion and the anticommutation relations of the Dirac field, just as the Klein Gordon Lagrangian in an ordinary path integral gives the equations of motion and commutation relations of the scalar field. By using the spatial Fourier transform of the Dirac field as a new basis for the Grassmann algebra, the quadratic part of the Dirac action becomes simple to invert:

:&lt;math&gt; S= \int_k \bar\psi\left( i\gamma^\mu k_\mu - m \right) \psi\,. &lt;/math&gt;

The propagator is the inverse of the matrix {{mvar|M}} linking {{math|''ψ''(''k'')}} and {{math|''{{overline|ψ}}''(''k'')}}, since different values of {{mvar|k}} do not mix together.

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\bar\psi(k') \psi (k) \right\rangle = \delta (k+k')\frac{1} {\gamma\cdot k - m}  = \delta(k+k')\frac{\gamma\cdot k+m }{ k^2 - m^2} &lt;/math&gt;

The analog of Wick's theorem matches {{mvar|ψ}} and {{mvar|{{overline|ψ}}}} in pairs:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\bar\psi(k_1) \bar\psi(k_2) \cdots \bar\psi(k_n) \psi(k'_1) \cdots \psi(k_n)\right\rangle = \sum_{\mathrm{pairings}} (-1)^S \prod_{\mathrm{pairs}\; i,j} \delta\left(k_i -k_j\right) \frac{1}{\gamma\cdot k_i - m}&lt;/math&gt;

where S is the sign of the permutation that reorders the sequence of {{mvar|{{overline|ψ}}}} and {{mvar|ψ}} to put the ones that are paired up to make the delta-functions next to each other, with the {{mvar|{{overline|ψ}}}} coming right before the {{mvar|ψ}}. Since a {{math|''ψ'', ''{{overline|ψ}}''}} pair is a commuting element of the Grassmann algebra, it doesn't matter what order the pairs are in. If more than one {{math|''ψ'', ''{{overline|ψ}}''}} pair have the same {{mvar|k}}, the integral is zero, and it is easy to check that the sum over pairings gives zero in this case (there are always an even number of them). This is the Grassmann analog of the higher Gaussian moments that completed the Bosonic Wick's theorem earlier.

The rules for spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} Dirac particles are as follows: The propagator is the inverse of the Dirac operator, the lines have arrows just as for a complex scalar field, and the diagram acquires an overall factor of −1 for each closed Fermi loop. If there are an odd number of Fermi loops, the diagram changes sign. Historically, the −1 rule was very difficult for Feynman to discover. He discovered it after a long process of trial and error, since he lacked a proper theory of Grassmann integration.

The rule follows from the observation that the number of Fermi lines at a vertex is always even. Each term in the Lagrangian must always be Bosonic. A Fermi loop is counted by following Fermionic lines until one comes back to the starting point, then removing those lines from the diagram. Repeating this process eventually erases all the Fermionic lines: this is the Euler algorithm to 2-color a graph, which works whenever each vertex has even degree. Note that the number of steps in the Euler algorithm is only equal to the number of independent Fermionic homology cycles in the common special case that all terms in the Lagrangian are exactly quadratic in the Fermi fields, so that each vertex has exactly two Fermionic lines. When there are four-Fermi interactions (like in the Fermi effective theory of the [[weak nuclear interaction]]s) there are more {{mvar|k}}-integrals than Fermi loops. In this case, the counting rule should apply the Euler algorithm by pairing up the Fermi lines at each vertex into pairs that together form a bosonic factor of the term in the Lagrangian, and when entering a vertex by one line, the algorithm should always leave with the partner line.

To clarify and prove the rule, consider a Feynman diagram formed from vertices, terms in the Lagrangian, with Fermion fields. The full term is Bosonic, it is a commuting element of the Grassmann algebra, so the order in which the vertices appear is not important. The Fermi lines are linked into loops, and when traversing the loop, one can reorder the vertex terms one after the other as one goes around without any sign cost. The exception is when you return to the starting point, and the final half-line must be joined with the unlinked first half-line. This requires one permutation to move the last {{mvar|{{overline|ψ}}}} to go in front of the first {{mvar|ψ}}, and this gives the sign.

This rule is the only visible effect of the exclusion principle in internal lines. When there are external lines, the amplitudes are antisymmetric when two Fermi insertions for identical particles are interchanged. This is automatic in the source formalism, because the sources for Fermi fields are themselves Grassmann valued.

==== Spin 1: photons ====
The naive propagator for photons is infinite, since the Lagrangian for the A-field is:

:&lt;math&gt; S = \int \tfrac14 F^{\mu\nu} F_{\mu\nu} = \int -\tfrac12\left(\partial^\mu A_\nu \partial_\mu A^\nu - \partial^\mu A_\mu \partial_\nu A^\nu \right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The quadratic form defining the propagator is non-invertible. The reason is the [[gauge invariance]] of the field; adding a gradient to {{mvar|A}} does not change the physics.

To fix this problem, one needs to fix a gauge. The most convenient way is to demand that the divergence of {{mvar|A}} is some function {{mvar|f}}, whose value is random from point to point. It does no harm to integrate over the values of {{mvar|f}}, since it only determines the choice of gauge. This procedure inserts the following factor into the path integral for {{mvar|A}}:

:&lt;math&gt; \int \delta\left(\partial_\mu A^\mu - f\right) e^{-\frac{f^2}{2} }\, Df\,. &lt;/math&gt;

The first factor, the delta function, fixes the gauge. The second factor sums over different values of {{mvar|f}} that are inequivalent gauge fixings. This is simply

:&lt;math&gt; e^{- \frac{\left(\partial_\mu A_\mu\right)^2}{2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The additional contribution from gauge-fixing cancels the second half of the free Lagrangian, giving the Feynman Lagrangian:

:&lt;math&gt; S= \int \partial^\mu A^\nu \partial_\mu A_\nu &lt;/math&gt;

which is just like four independent free scalar fields, one for each component of {{mvar|A}}. The Feynman propagator is:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle A_\mu(k) A_\nu(k') \right\rangle = \delta\left(k+k'\right) \frac{g_{\mu\nu}}{ k^2 }.&lt;/math&gt;

The one difference is that the sign of one propagator is wrong in the Lorentz case: the timelike component has an opposite sign propagator. This means that these particle states have negative norm—they are not physical states. In the case of photons, it is easy to show by diagram methods that these states are not physical—their contribution cancels with longitudinal photons to only leave two physical photon polarization contributions for any value of {{mvar|k}}.

If the averaging over {{mvar|f}} is done with a coefficient different from {{sfrac|1|2}}, the two terms don't cancel completely. This gives a covariant Lagrangian with a coefficient &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, which does not affect anything:

:&lt;math&gt; S= \int \tfrac12\left(\partial^\mu A^\nu \partial_\mu A_\nu - \lambda \left(\partial_\mu A^\mu\right)^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and the covariant propagator for QED is:

:&lt;math&gt;\left \langle A_\mu(k) A_\nu(k') \right\rangle =\delta\left(k+k'\right)\frac{g_{\mu\nu} - \lambda\frac{k_\mu k_\nu }{ k^2} }{ k^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Spin 1: non-Abelian ghosts ====
To find the Feynman rules for non-Abelian gauge fields, the procedure that performs the gauge fixing must be carefully corrected to account for a change of variables in the path-integral.

The gauge fixing factor has an extra determinant from popping the delta function:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta\left(\partial_\mu A_\mu - f\right) e^{-\frac{f^2}{2}} \det M &lt;/math&gt;

To find the form of the determinant, consider first a simple two-dimensional integral of a function {{mvar|f}} that depends only on {{mvar|r}}, not on the angle {{mvar|θ}}. Inserting an integral over {{mvar|θ}}:

:&lt;math&gt; \int f(r)\, dx\, dy = \int f(r) \int d\theta\, \delta(y) \left|\frac{dy}{d\theta}\right|\, dx\, dy &lt;/math&gt;

The derivative-factor ensures that popping the delta function in {{mvar|θ}} removes the integral. Exchanging the order of integration,

:&lt;math&gt; \int f(r)\, dx\, dy = \int d\theta\, \int f(r) \delta(y) \left|\frac{dy}{d\theta}\right|\, dx\, dy &lt;/math&gt;

but now the delta-function can be popped in {{mvar|y}},

:&lt;math&gt; \int f(r)\, dx\, dy = \int d\theta_0\, \int f(x) \left|\frac{dy}{d\theta}\right|\, dx\,. &lt;/math&gt;

The integral over {{mvar|θ}} just gives an overall factor of 2{{pi}}, while the rate of change of {{mvar|y}} with a change in {{mvar|θ}} is just {{mvar|x}}, so this exercise reproduces the standard formula for polar integration of a radial function:

:&lt;math&gt; \int f(r)\, dx\, dy = 2\pi \int f(x) x\, dx &lt;/math&gt;

In the path-integral for a nonabelian gauge field, the analogous manipulation is:

:&lt;math&gt; \int DA \int \delta\big(F(A)\big) \det\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial G}\right)\, DG e^{iS} = \int DG \int \delta\big(F(A)\big)\det\left(\frac{\partial F}{ \partial G}\right) e^{iS} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The factor in front is the volume of the gauge group, and it contributes a constant, which can be discarded. The remaining integral is over the gauge fixed action.

:&lt;math&gt; \int \det\left(\frac{\partial F}{ \partial G}\right)e^{iS_{GF}}\, DA \,&lt;/math&gt;

To get a covariant gauge, the gauge fixing condition is the same as in the Abelian case:

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_\mu A^\mu = f \,,&lt;/math&gt;

Whose variation under an infinitesimal gauge transformation is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_\mu\, D_\mu \alpha \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|α}} is the adjoint valued element of the Lie algebra at every point that performs the infinitesimal gauge transformation. This adds the Faddeev Popov determinant to the action:

:&lt;math&gt; \det\left(\partial_\mu\, D_\mu\right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

which can be rewritten as a Grassmann integral by introducing ghost fields:

:&lt;math&gt; \int e^{\bar\eta \partial_\mu\, D^\mu \eta}\, D\bar\eta\, D\eta \,&lt;/math&gt;

The determinant is independent of {{mvar|f}}, so the path-integral over {{mvar|f}} can give the Feynman propagator (or a covariant propagator) by choosing the measure for {{mvar|f}} as in the abelian case. The full gauge fixed action is then the Yang Mills action in Feynman gauge with an additional ghost action:

:&lt;math&gt; S= \int \operatorname{Tr} \partial_\mu A_\nu \partial^\mu A^\nu + f^i_{jk} \partial^\nu A_i^\mu A^j_\mu A^k_\nu + f^i_{jr} f^r_{kl} A_i A_j A^k A^l + \operatorname{Tr} \partial_\mu \bar\eta \partial^\mu \eta + \bar\eta A_j \eta \,&lt;/math&gt;

The diagrams are derived from this action. The propagator for the spin-1 fields has the usual Feynman form. There are vertices of degree 3 with momentum factors whose couplings are the structure constants, and vertices of degree 4 whose couplings are products of structure constants. There are additional ghost loops, which cancel out timelike and longitudinal states in {{mvar|A}} loops.

In the Abelian case, the determinant for covariant gauges does not depend on {{mvar|A}}, so the ghosts do not contribute to the connected diagrams.

== Particle-path representation ==
Feynman diagrams were originally discovered by Feynman, by trial and error, as a way to represent the contribution to the S-matrix from different classes of particle trajectories.

=== Schwinger representation&lt;!--'Schwinger representation' redirects here--&gt; ===
The Euclidean scalar propagator has a suggestive representation:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{p^2+m^2} = \int_0^\infty e^{-\tau\left(p^2 + m^2\right)}\, d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

The meaning of this identity (which is an elementary integration) is made clearer by Fourier transforming to real space.

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(x) = \int_0^\infty d\tau e^{-m^2\tau} \frac{1}{ ({4\pi\tau})^{d/2}}e^\frac{-x^2}{ 4\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

The contribution at any one value of {{mvar|τ}} to the propagator is a Gaussian of width {{math|{{sqrt|''τ''}}}}. The total propagation function from 0 to {{mvar|x}} is a weighted sum over all proper times {{mvar|τ}} of a normalized Gaussian, the probability of ending up at {{mvar|x}} after a random walk of time {{mvar|τ}}.

The path-integral representation for the propagator is then:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(x) = \int_0^\infty d\tau \int DX\, e^{- \int\limits_0^{\tau} \left(\frac{\dot{x}^2}{2} + m^2\right) d\tau'} &lt;/math&gt;

which is a path-integral rewrite of the '''Schwinger representation'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

The Schwinger representation is both useful for making manifest the particle aspect of the propagator, and for symmetrizing denominators of loop diagrams.

=== Combining denominators ===
The Schwinger representation has an immediate practical application to loop diagrams. For example, for the diagram in the {{math|''φ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} theory formed by joining two {{mvar|x}}s together in two half-lines, and making the remaining lines external, the integral over the internal propagators in the loop is:

: &lt;math&gt; \int_k \frac{1}{k^2 + m^2} \frac{1}{ (k+p)^2 + m^2} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Here one line carries momentum {{mvar|k}} and the other {{math|''k'' + ''p''}}. The asymmetry can be fixed by putting everything in the Schwinger representation.

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{t,t'} e^{-t(k^2+m^2) - t'\left((k+p)^2 +m^2\right) }\, dt\, dt'\,. &lt;/math&gt;

Now the exponent mostly depends on {{math|''t'' + ''t''′}},

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{t,t'} e^{-(t+t')(k^2+m^2) - t' 2p\cdot k -t' p^2}\,, &lt;/math&gt;

except for the asymmetrical little bit. Defining the variable {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''t'' + ''t''′}} and {{math|''v'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''t''′|''u''}}}}, the variable {{mvar|u}} goes from 0 to {{math|∞}}, while {{mvar|v}} goes from 0 to 1. The variable {{mvar|u}} is the total proper time for the loop, while {{mvar|v}} parametrizes the fraction of the proper time on the top of the loop versus the bottom.

The Jacobian for this transformation of variables is easy to work out from the identities:

:&lt;math&gt; d(uv)= dt'\quad du = dt+dt'\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and "wedging" gives

:&lt;math&gt; u\, du \wedge dv = dt \wedge dt'\,&lt;/math&gt;.

This allows the {{mvar|u}} integral to be evaluated explicitly:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{u,v} u e^{-u \left( k^2+m^2 + v 2p\cdot k + v p^2\right)} = \int \frac{1}{\left(k^2 + m^2 + v 2p\cdot k - v p^2\right)^2}\, dv &lt;/math&gt;

leaving only the {{mvar|v}}-integral. This method, invented by Schwinger but usually attributed to Feynman, is called ''combining denominator''. Abstractly, it is the elementary identity:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{AB}= \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\big( vA+ (1-v)B\big)^2}\, dv &lt;/math&gt;

But this form does not provide the physical motivation for introducing {{mvar|v}}; {{mvar|v}} is the proportion of proper time on one of the legs of the loop.

Once the denominators are combined, a shift in {{mvar|k}} to {{math|''k''′ {{=}} ''k'' + ''vp''}} symmetrizes everything:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^1 \int\frac{1}{\left(k^2 + m^2 + 2vp \cdot k + v p^2\right)^2}\, dk\, dv = \int_0^1 \int \frac{1}{\left(k'^2 + m^2 + v(1-v)p^2\right)^2}\, dk'\, dv&lt;/math&gt;

This form shows that the moment that {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is more negative than four times the mass of the particle in the loop, which happens in a physical region of Lorentz space, the integral has a cut. This is exactly when the external momentum can create physical particles.

When the loop has more vertices, there are more denominators to combine:

:&lt;math&gt; \int dk\, \frac{1}{k^2 + m^2} \frac{1}{(k+p_1)^2 + m^2} \cdots \frac{1}{(k+p_n)^2 + m^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The general rule follows from the Schwinger prescription for {{mvar|''n'' + 1}} denominators:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{D_0 D_1 \cdots D_n} = \int_0^\infty \cdots\int_0^\infty e^{-u_0 D_0 \cdots -u_n D_n}\, du_0 \cdots du_n \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The integral over the Schwinger parameters {{mvar|u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be split up as before into an integral over the total proper time {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; … + ''u&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and an integral over the fraction of the proper time in all but the first segment of the loop {{math|''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''|''u''}}}} for {{math|''i'' ∈ {{mset|1,2,…,''n''}}}}. The {{mvar|v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} are positive and add up to less than 1, so that the {{mvar|v}} integral is over an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional simplex.

The Jacobian for the coordinate transformation can be worked out as before:

:&lt;math&gt; du = du_0 + du_1 \cdots + du_n \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; d(uv_i) = d u_i \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Wedging all these equations together, one obtains

:&lt;math&gt; u^n\, du \wedge dv_1 \wedge dv_2 \cdots \wedge dv_n = du_0 \wedge du_1 \cdots \wedge du_n \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the integral:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^\infty \int_{\mathrm{simplex}} u^n e^{-u\left(v_0 D_0 + v_1 D_1 + v_2 D_2 \cdots + v_n D_n\right)}\, dv_1\cdots dv_n\, du\,, &lt;/math&gt;

where the simplex is the region defined by the conditions
:&lt;math&gt;v_i&gt;0 \quad \mbox{and} \quad \sum_{i=1}^n v_i &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;
as well as
:&lt;math&gt;v_0 = 1-\sum_{i=1}^n v_i\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Performing the {{mvar|u}} integral gives the general prescription for combining denominators:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{ D_0 \cdots D_n } = n! \int_{\mathrm{simplex}} \frac{1}{ \left(v_0 D_0 +v_1 D_1 \cdots + v_n D_n\right)^{n+1}}\, dv_1\, dv_2 \cdots dv_n &lt;/math&gt;

Since the numerator of the integrand is not involved, the same prescription works for any loop, no matter what the spins are carried by the legs. The interpretation of the parameters {{mvar|v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is that they are the fraction of the total proper time spent on each leg.

=== Scattering ===
The correlation functions of a quantum field theory describe the scattering of particles. The definition of "particle" in relativistic field theory is not self-evident, because if you try to determine the position so that the uncertainty is less than the [[compton wavelength]], the uncertainty in energy is large enough to produce more particles and antiparticles of the same type from the vacuum. This means that the notion of a single-particle state is to some extent incompatible with the notion of an object localized in space.

In the 1930s, [[Eugene Wigner|Wigner]] gave a mathematical definition for single-particle states: they are a collection of states that form an irreducible representation of the Poincaré group. Single particle states describe an object with a finite mass, a well defined momentum, and a spin. This definition is fine for protons and neutrons, electrons and photons, but it excludes quarks, which are permanently confined, so the modern point of view is more accommodating: a particle is anything whose interaction can be described in terms of Feynman diagrams, which have an interpretation as a sum over particle trajectories.

A field operator can act to produce a one-particle state from the vacuum, which means that the field operator {{mvar|''φ''(''x'')}} produces a superposition of Wigner particle states. In the free field theory, the field produces one particle states only. But when there are interactions, the field operator can also produce 3-particle, 5-particle (if there is no +/− symmetry also 2, 4, 6 particle) states too. To compute the scattering amplitude for single particle states only requires a careful limit, sending the fields to infinity and integrating over space to get rid of the higher-order corrections.

The relation between scattering and correlation functions is the LSZ-theorem: The scattering amplitude for {{mvar|n}} particles to go to {{mvar|m}} particles in a scattering event is the given by the sum of the Feynman diagrams that go into the correlation function for {{math|''n'' + ''m''}} field insertions, leaving out the propagators for the external legs.

For example, for the {{math|''λφ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} interaction of the previous section, the order {{mvar|λ}} contribution to the (Lorentz) correlation function is:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle \phi(k_1)\phi(k_2)\phi(k_3)\phi(k_4)\right\rangle = \frac{i}{k_1^2}\frac{i}{k_2^2} \frac{i}{k_3^2} \frac{i}{k_4^2} i\lambda \,&lt;/math&gt;

Stripping off the external propagators, that is, removing the factors of {{math|{{sfrac|''i''|''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}, gives the invariant scattering amplitude {{mvar|M}}:

:&lt;math&gt; M = i\lambda \,&lt;/math&gt;

which is a constant, independent of the incoming and outgoing momentum. The interpretation of the scattering amplitude is that the sum of {{math|{{abs|''M''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} over all possible final states is the probability for the scattering event. The normalization of the single-particle states must be chosen carefully, however, to ensure that {{mvar|M}} is a relativistic invariant.

Non-relativistic single particle states are labeled by the momentum {{mvar|k}}, and they are chosen to have the same norm at every value of {{mvar|k}}. This is because the nonrelativistic unit operator on single particle states is:

:&lt;math&gt; \int dk\, |k\rangle\langle k|\,. &lt;/math&gt;

In relativity, the integral over the {{mvar|k}}-states for a particle of mass m integrates over a hyperbola in {{math|''E'',''k''}} space defined by the energy–momentum relation:

:&lt;math&gt; E^2 - k^2 = m^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

If the integral weighs each {{mvar|k}} point equally, the measure is not Lorentz-invariant. The invariant measure integrates over all values of {{mvar|k}} and {{mvar|E}}, restricting to the hyperbola with a Lorentz-invariant delta function:

:&lt;math&gt; \int \delta(E^2-k^2 - m^2) |E,k\rangle\langle E,k|\, dE\, dk = \int {dk \over 2 E} |k\rangle\langle k|\,.&lt;/math&gt;

So the normalized {{mvar|k}}-states are different from the relativistically normalized {{mvar|k}}-states by a factor of
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{E} = \left(k^2-m^2\right)^\frac14\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The invariant amplitude {{mvar|M}} is then the probability amplitude for relativistically normalized incoming states to become relativistically normalized outgoing states.

For nonrelativistic values of {{mvar|k}}, the relativistic normalization is the same as the nonrelativistic normalization (up to a constant factor {{math|{{sqrt|''m''}}}}). In this limit, the {{math|''φ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} invariant scattering amplitude is still constant. The particles created by the field {{mvar|φ}} scatter in all directions with equal amplitude.

The nonrelativistic potential, which scatters in all directions with an equal amplitude (in the [[Born approximation]]), is one whose Fourier transform is constant—a delta-function potential. The lowest order scattering of the theory reveals the non-relativistic interpretation of this theory—it describes a collection of particles with a delta-function repulsion. Two such particles have an aversion to occupying the same point at the same time.

== Nonperturbative effects ==
Thinking of Feynman diagrams as a perturbation series, nonperturbative effects like tunneling do not show up, because any effect that goes to zero faster than any polynomial does not affect the Taylor series. Even bound states are absent, since at any finite order particles are only exchanged a finite number of times, and to make a bound state, the binding force must last forever.

But this point of view is misleading, because the diagrams not only describe scattering, but they also are a representation of the short-distance field theory correlations. They encode not only asymptotic processes like particle scattering, they also describe the multiplication rules for fields, the [[operator product expansion]]. Nonperturbative tunneling processes involve field configurations that on average get big when the coupling constant gets small, but each configuration is a coherent superposition of particles whose local interactions are described by Feynman diagrams. When the coupling is small, these become collective processes that involve large numbers of particles, but where the interactions between each of the particles is simple.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

This means that nonperturbative effects show up asymptotically in resummations of infinite classes of diagrams, and these diagrams can be locally simple. The graphs determine the local equations of motion, while the allowed large-scale configurations describe non-perturbative physics. But because Feynman propagators are nonlocal in time, translating a field process to a coherent particle language is not completely intuitive, and has only been explicitly worked out in certain special cases. In the case of nonrelativistic bound states, the [[Bethe–Salpeter equation]] describes the class of diagrams to include to describe a relativistic atom. For quantum chromodynamics, the Shifman Vainshtein Zakharov sum rules describe non-perturbatively excited long-wavelength field modes in particle language, but only in a phenomenological way.

The number of Feynman diagrams at high orders of perturbation theory is very large, because there are as many diagrams as there are graphs with a given number of nodes. Nonperturbative effects leave a signature on the way in which the number of diagrams and resummations diverge at high order. It is only because non-perturbative effects appear in hidden form in diagrams that it was possible to analyze nonperturbative effects in string theory, where in many cases a Feynman description is the only one available.

{{Status of religious freedom}}
[[South Africa]] is a [[secular state]], with [[freedom of religion]] enshrined in the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]].

==Legislation==

===Constitution===
The [[preamble]] to [[post-apartheid South Africa]]'s [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution of 1996]] contains [[constitutional references to God|references to God]] in the form of a multilingual [[evocation]] asking for God's protection and blessing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution-republic-south-africa-1996-preamble|title=Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 – Preamble|publisher=Government of South Africa|quote=May God protect our people. Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. Morena boloka setjhaba sa heso. God seën Suid-Afrika. God bless South Africa.|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch theologian Johannes van der Ven describes this text as a "rhetorical petition prayer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Johannes A.|last=van der Ven|editor1-last=Osmer|editor1-first=Richard R.|editor2-last=Schweitzer|editor2-first=Friedrich L.|title=Developing a public faith: new directions in practical theology: essays in honor of James W. Fowler|publisher=Chalice Press|location=St. Louis, Missouri|chapter=Religious Freedom and the Public Church|pages=189–202|year=2003|isbn=9780827206311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution nevertheless enshrines the right to freedom of religion.

[[Chapter 2 of the Constitution of South Africa]], the Bill of Rights, contains a number of provisions dealing with religious freedom. [[Section 9 of the Constitution of South Africa|Section 9]], the equality clause, prohibits unfair discrimination on various grounds including religion and requires national legislation to be enacted to prevent or prohibit unfair discrimination. Section 15 states that everyone has the right to freedom of conscience, religion, thought, belief and opinion. This section also allows religious observances in state and state-aided institutions, provided they follow public authority rules, they are conducted on an equitable basis and attendance is free and voluntary; and provides for the recognition of religious legal systems and marriages that are not inconsistent with the Constitution. Section 31 protects the right of persons belonging to a religious community to practise their religion together with other members of that community, and to form, join and maintain voluntary religious associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of South Africa: Bill of Rights|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/chapter-2-bill-rights|publisher=Government of South Africa|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other provisions of the Constitution relate to religion and religious freedom. Sections 185 and 186 provide for a commission for the promotion and protection of the rights of cultural, religious and linguistic communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of South Africa: Chapter 9: State institutions supporting constitutional democracy, Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution-republic-south-africa-1996-chapter-9-state-institutions-supporting|publisher=Government of South Africa|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, human rights such as the right to human dignity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of South Africa: Bill of Rights: Section 10: Human dignity|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/chapter-2-bill-rights#10|publisher=Government of South Africa|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the right to freedom of expression&lt;ref name=Section16&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of South Africa: Bill of Rights: Section 16: Freedom of expression|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/chapter-2-bill-rights#16|publisher=Government of South Africa|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the right to freedom of association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of South Africa: Bill of Rights: Section 18: Freedom of association|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/chapter-2-bill-rights#18|publisher=Government of South Africa|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; relate indirectly to the protection of religious freedom. The right to freedom of expression does not extend to [[hate speech]] based on various grounds including religion.&lt;ref name=Section16 /&gt;

The constitutional right to freedom of religion is not absolute. In his keynote speech at the public endorsement ceremony of the ''[[South African Charter of Religious Rights and Freedoms]]'' in [[Johannesburg]] on 21 October 2010 [[Deputy Chief Justice of South Africa|Deputy Chief Justice]] [[Dikgang Moseneke]] stated:

&lt;poem&gt;{{blockquote|Most of the provisions of the charter may appear uncontroversial, and yet as a sitting justice of the Constitutional Court moments may present themselves when I may be duty-bound to proffer judicial opinion on the remit or impact of one or more of its provisions, if they were to be formally enacted, or if a justiciable dispute about its enactment should arise. I am thus honour-bound to keep an open mind on the constitutional appropriateness of its provisions.
...
Every right guaranteed in the Bill of Rights may be limited by a law of general application. Thus the right to religious freedom is not absolute. Its scope may be limited by other rights or by a law in pursuit of a legitimate government purpose.
...
We have opted for a secular state which is enjoined to observe strict neutrality among religious tendencies. This duty indeed extends to the right not to believe or hold or observe any religion.
Where religious rights are at odds with other constitutional guarantees or a legitimate government purpose, the conflict must be weighed carefully, keeping in mind that in our constitutional democracy the constitution is supreme and there is no hierarchy of rights. All rank equally. We all have the right to be different.|Dikgang Moseneke|{{cite web|title=The right to differ religiously|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-240224117.html|date=24 October 2010|publisher=The Sunday Independent {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=18 March 2014}}}}&lt;/poem&gt;

===Equality Act===
Pursuant to [[Section Nine of the Constitution of South Africa|Section 9 of the Constitution]], the [[Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, 2000|Equality Act of 2000]] prohibits unfair discrimination on various grounds including religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act 4 of 2000|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2000-004.pdf|publisher=DOJ&amp;CD|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Briefing Document: Equality Act and equality courts|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/EQCact/eqc_briefingdoc.html|publisher=DOJ&amp;CD|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Equality Act does not apply to unfair discrimination in the workplace, which is covered by the Employment Equity Act.&lt;ref name=LodgingComplaint/&gt;

===South African Human Rights Commission===
The [[South African Human Rights Commission]] (SAHRC) is a [[chapter nine institution]] inaugurated in 1995 to support [[Liberal democracy|constitutional democracy]]. The SAHRC investigates complaints about unfair discrimination and assists members of the public with cases heard in Equality Courts.&lt;ref name=LodgingComplaint&gt;{{cite web|title=Lodging a complaint in the Equality Court: Equality/Discrimination|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/services/discrimination.html|publisher=DOJ&amp;CD|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the SAHRC|url=http://www.sahrc.org.za/home/index.php?ipkContentID=1&amp;ipkMenuID=28|publisher=SAHRC|accessdate=30 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307012102/http://www.sahrc.org.za///home/index.php?ipkContentID=1&amp;ipkMenuID=28|archivedate=7 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equality for all!

==Religion in schools==
National legislation and policies governing religion in schools relate to [[Religious education in primary and secondary education|Religion Education]], religious observances in schools and school dress codes:
*The National Policy on Religion and Education adopted in September 2003 provides for Religion Education, i.e. education about diverse religions, which does not promote any particular religion in the [[State school|public school]] curriculum.&lt;ref name=REPolicy&gt;{{cite web|title=National Policy on Religion and Education|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/national-policy-religion-and-education|publisher=Government of South Africa|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion Education is covered in the Life Orientation subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Curriculum Statement Grades 10-12 (General) Life Orientation|url=http://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=xY8RaCOWqTY%3D&amp;..|year=2003|publisher=Department of Education|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative reforms==
The new Constitution did not result in immediate reform of discriminatory legislation infringing on the right to religious freedom. Various legislative reforms have taken place or have been initiated since 1994 as a result of lobbying by disenfranchised groups.

The [[Civil Union Act, 2006|Civil Union Act]], which came into effect on 30 November 2006, legalised [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|same-sex marriage]] and also allowed for the legal designation of religious marriage officers without any religious restriction in accordance with the Constitution. Previously, religious marriage officers could only be legally designated as such "for the purpose of solemnizing marriages according to Christian, Jewish or Mohammedan rites or the rites of any Indian religion" in accordance with the [[Marriage Act, 1961 (South Africa)|Marriage Act]]. In accordance with section 5 of the Civil Union Act, any religious organisation may apply to the [[Department of Home Affairs (South Africa)|Department of Home Affairs]] for designation as a religious organisation and when designated as such must formally nominate suitable candidates from within their organisation to be designated by the Department of Home Affairs as religious marriage officers for the purpose of solemnising marriages according to the rites of that religious organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Union Act 17 of 2006|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/civil-union-act|publisher=Government of South Africa|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Witchcraft Suppression Act, 1957|Witchcraft Suppression Act of 1957]] based on colonial witchcraft legislation criminalises claiming a knowledge of witchcraft, conducting specified practices associated with witchcraft including the use of charms and divination, and accusing others of practising witchcraft.&lt;ref name=WSA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/1957-003.pdf|title=Witchcraft Suppression Act 3 of 1957|publisher=DOJ&amp;CD|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the [[South African Law Reform Commission]] received submissions from the South African Pagan Rights Alliance and the Traditional Healers Organization requesting the investigation of the constitutionality of the act and on 23 March 2010 the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development approved a South African Law Reform Commission project to review witchcraft legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sapra Appeal for legislative reform|publisher=vuya.net|date=10 July 2007|url=http://www.vuya.net/node/2677|accessdate=18 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121220043355/http://www.vuya.net/node/2677|archivedate=20 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Department of Justice and Constitutional Development|title=Current Investigations: Progress Report; Project 135: Review of witchcraft legislation|publisher=DOJ&amp;CD|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/salrc/progress.htm|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gel bracelets''', or '''jelly bracelets''' are an inexpensive type of [[wristband]] often made from [[Silicone]]. They come in a variety of colors, and several can be worn on each arm. They have been popular in waves throughout the [[Western world]] and elsewhere since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;Mikkelson, Barbara (2003).

[[File:I'm with Coco wristband.jpg|alt=|thumb|Livestrong wristbands popularized gel bracelets for charity purposes. This humorous example is used to raise awareness about the [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|2010 ''Tonight Show'' conflict]].]]
The silicone wristband first became popular in 2004 with the [[Livestrong wristband|Livestrong]] yellow band which was set up by American cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]] to raise awareness of [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Walker | first = Rob | title = Yellow Fever | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2004-08-29 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=980CE7DA153EF93AA1575BC0A9629C8B63 | accessdate = 2007-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2014}} A larger, 1" wide variety became more popular in 2007, with bands selling the inexpensive items to young concert fans.  Both the wider and thinner bands are cheap to customize and as a result have become a popular fundraising tool in America and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.wristbandbros.com/glossary/gel-wristbands/|title = Gel Wristbands Explained|date = 9 September 2015|accessdate = 9 September 2015|website = Wristband Bros|publisher = Sean Mulligan|last = Mulligan|first = Sean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of these wristbands varies depending on the particular campaign, but are often $1 or £1 and usually the majority of the money goes towards the charity involved. They are seen by young people as trendier than traditional charity pins which may explain their increase in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.britishcouncil.org/poland-charity-wristband-trend.htm| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071120053813/http://www.britishcouncil.org/poland-charity-wristband-trend.htm| archivedate = 2007-11-20| title = charity wristband trend| deadurl = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a resurgence in popularity in 2003, gel bracelets became the subject of a widespread [[urban legend]] linking them to a supposed sex game explaining their popularity among young teenagers: they were subsequently dubbed "'''sex bracelets'''".&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Aguilar, Alexa|author2=Bell, Kaitlin|date=November 18, 2003|url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/News/A9286BCB3F0E79D386256DE30017FF18?OpenDocument&amp;Headline=Rumors+link+bracelets+to+sex+game+|title=Rumors Link Bracelets to Sex Game.|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|archiveurl=https://business.highbeam.com/435553/article-1G1-110317398/rumors-link-bracelets-sex-game|archivedate=November 19, 2003|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/EDUCATION/12/10/sex.bracelet.ap/|title=Student 'sex bracelets' an urban legend?|date=December 12, 2003|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=February 10, 2006|location=CHICAGO, Illinois|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031220191943/http://www.cnn.com/2003/EDUCATION/12/10/sex.bracelet.ap/|archivedate=December 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to rumors, people who wore the jewelry implied they were willing to engage in various acts with whoever pulled them from their wrists; the acts ranged from hugging and [[kiss]]ing to [[sexual intercourse]], and were determined by the bracelet's color.

In October 2003, the rumors were prominent enough in Alachua Elementary School in [[Gainesville, Florida]] that the principal banned the bracelets to avert disruption and inappropriate comments about them.&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.gainesville.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031018/LOCAL/210180317&amp;SearchID=73258459105519|title=Principal puts ban on 'sex bracelets'|last=James|first=Douane D.|date=October 18, 2003|work=[[The Gainesville Sun]]|accessdate=September 30, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307005654/http://search.gainesville.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20031018%2FLOCAL%2F210180317&amp;SearchID=73258459105519|archivedate=2007-03-07|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were subsequently banned in other schools around Florida and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; The effectors of these early bans did not insinuate that the rumors were true; however, some later media reports suggested that they may have been,&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;For example, see: {{cite web|url=http://www.nbc10.com/family/2649800/detail.html|title='Sex Bracelets' Cause Parental Concern|date=November 20, 2003|work=NBC Philadelphia|publisher=NBC10.com|accessdate=September 30, 2006|location=RALEIGH, N.C.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211223640/http://www.nbc10.com/family/2649800/detail.html|archivedate=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; generating something of a [[moral panic]].&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; The supposed meanings of the colours of the bands were reported in the British press in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1486387/Blair-joins-wristband-celebrities-who-make-charity-cool.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Sally | last=Pook | title=Blair joins wristband celebrities who make charity cool | date=March 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very similar set of stories surfaced (or re-surfaced) in the British media in 2009, in which the bracelets were allegedly nicknamed ''shag bands''.&lt;ref name="Mirror"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/fury-over-sex-bracelets-sold-420820|title=Fury over 'sex' bracelets sold to school children|last=Stretch|first=Euan|date=25 Sep 2009|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=mirror.co.uk|accessdate=25 Oct 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article6910040.ece|title=Would you let your daughter wear a "shag band"?|last=Midgley|first=Carol|date=10 Nov 2009|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=10 Nov 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/2658958/Bracelet-which-means-your-child-is-having-SEX.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024020040/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/2658958/Bracelet-which-means-your-child-is-having-SEX.html|archivedate=2015-10-24|title=Bracelet which means your child is having SEX|last=Pearce|first=Dulcie|date=29 Sep 2009|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|accessdate=16 November 2010|location=London|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar stories circulated widely in Brazil during the 2009–2010 summer, where the bracelets were referred to as ''pulseiras do sexo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/SaoPaulo/0,,MUL1412235-5605,00-PULSEIRA+DO+SEXO+GERA+POLEMICA+ENTRE+PAIS+E+EDUCADORES+EM+SP.html |title=‘Pulseira do sexo’ gera polêmica entre pais e educadores em SP|trans-title='Sex bracelets' generates controversy among parents and educators in São Paulo |author=Paulo Toledo Piza|date=13 December 2009|language=Portuguese|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, a 13-year-old girl in Brazil was raped by three teenage boys after one of them snatched the bracelet she was wearing. The police stated that the crime was motivated by the use of sex bracelets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL1552238-5598,00-APOS+TER+PULSEIRA+DO+SEXO+ARRANCADA+ADOLESCENTE+E+ESTUPRADA+EM+LONDRINA.html |title=Após ter 'pulseira do sexo' arrancada, adolescente é estuprada em Londrina|trans-title=After 'sex bracelet' ripped off teen is raped in Londrina|author=Glauco Araújo|date=31 March 2010|language=Portuguese|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different versions associate different colors with sex acts (similar to the [[handkerchief code]]). For example, purple might be associated with kissing, red with [[lap dance|lapdancing]], and black with intercourse.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce"/&gt; Some versions said the involved action occurs at parties held for the purpose, making them similar to contemporary rumors of "[[rainbow party (sexuality)|rainbow parties]]", a gathering at which groups of girls wearing varying shades of [[lipstick]] supposedly take turns [[fellatio|fellating]] their classmates, leaving an array of colors on their penises. Other tales of teenage [[group sex|sex parties]] have circulated at various times. [[Folkloristics|Folklorist]] Barbara Mikkelson of [[snopes|snopes.com]] associates the "sex bracelet" stories with similar ones of the past.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; In the 1970s, pulltabs from [[beverage can|aluminum cans]] and labels from [[beer bottle]]s were supposedly considered "sex coupons" and obligated any girl presented with one to sleep with the bearer; by the 1990s the rumors shifted to include an assortment of plastic items, including some worn as bracelets. According to Mikkelson, there is likely little truth behind the stories, and the vast majority of teenagers who contact her site express shock and disappointment that so many have believed them.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt;

At least one particular type of gel bracelet called the MY Single Band was specifically designed to advertise the wearer's relationship status.&lt;ref name=nydaily&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Victoria|title=Will bracelets for singles revolutionize dating?|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/single-band-shows-world-single-article-1.1434446|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|date=22 August 2013|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web|last=Dockterman|first=Eliana|title=MY Single Band: A Bracelet That Advertises You’re Single|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/09/01/wear-your-heart-on-your-sleeve-bracelets-advertise-youre-single/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1 September 2013|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press release, creators, Rina Mardahl and Rob Young, compared their concept to that of [[wedding rings]] that show the married status of a wearer,&lt;ref name=pr&gt;{{cite press release | title =Meeting Other Singles Just Got a Whole Lot Easier!  | publisher =[[PR Newswire]] | date =20 August 2013 | url =http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/meeting-other-singles-just-got-a-whole-lot-easier-220313101.html | accessdate = 1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young saying he "saw hundreds of people each day that could potentially be a suitable partner, yet there was no way of knowing their relationship status."&lt;ref name=mail&gt;{{cite web|last=De Lacey|first=Martha|title=Would you wear a wristband to show you're single?

'''Generative art''' refers to [[art]] that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system. An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist. In some cases the human creator may claim that the [[Generative systems|generative system]] represents their own artistic idea, and in others that the system takes on the role of the creator.

"Generative art" often refers to [[algorithmic art]] (algorithmically determined computer generated artwork), but artists can also make it using systems of [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[mechanics]] and [[robotics]], [[smart materials]], manual [[randomization]], [[mathematics]], [[data mapping]], [[symmetry]], [[Tessellation|tiling]], and more.

== History ==

The use of the word "generative" in the discussion of art has developed over time. The use of "[[Artificial DNA]]" defines a generative approach to art focused on the construction of a system able to generate unpredictable events, all with a recognizable common character. The use of [[autonomous robot|autonomous systems]], required by some contemporary definitions, focuses a generative approach where the controls are strongly reduced. This approach is also named "emergent". [[Margaret Boden]] and Ernest Edmonds have noted the use of the term "generative art" in the broad context of automated computer graphics in the 1960s, beginning with artwork exhibited by [[Georg Nees]] and [[Frieder Nake]] in 1965:&lt;ref name="Boden"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boden, Margaret |author2=Edmonds, Ernest |author1link=Margaret Boden |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233128802_What_is_generative_art |title=What is Generative Art? |journal=Digital Creativity |date=2009 |volume=20 |issue=1/2 |pages=21–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 {{quotation | The  terms  "generative art"  and  "computer  art"  have been  used  in  tandem,  and  more  or  less interchangeably, since the very earliest days.&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt;}}

The first such exhibition showed the work of Nees in February 1965, which some claim was titled "Generative Computergrafik".&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; While Nees does not himself remember, this was the title of his doctoral thesis published a few years later.&lt;ref name=Nake12&gt;{{cite web |last=Nake |first=Frieder |title=Georg Nees: Generative Computergrafik |url=http://dada.compart-bremen.de/node/3280 |publisher=University of Bremen |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correct title of the first exhibition and catalog was "computer-grafik".&lt;ref&gt;Ness, Georg; Bense, Max: ''computer-grafik''; Edition Rot 19; Stuttgart, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; "Generative art" and related terms was in common use by several other early computer artists around this time, including [[Manfred Mohr]].&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; The term "Generative Art" with the meaning of dynamic artwork-systems able to generate multiple artwork-events was clearly used the first time for the "Generative Art" conference in Milan in 1998.

The term has also been used to describe geometric [[abstract art]] where simple elements are repeated, transformed, or varied to generate more complex forms. Thus defined, generative art was practised by the Argentinian artists Eduardo McEntyre and Miguel Ángel Vidal in the late 1960s. In 1972 the Romanian-born Paul Neagu created the Generative Art Group in Britain. It was populated exclusively by Neagu using aliases such as "Hunsy Belmood" and "Edward Larsocchi." In 1972 Neagu gave a lecture titled 'Generative Art Forms' at the [[Queen's University, Belfast]] Festival.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Harold, ed. ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Art'', Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, J. A. ''Glossary of art, architecture, and design since 1945 (3rd ed.)'', London; Boston: Library Association Publishing; G.K. Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] created a department called "Generative Systems." As described by [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] the focus was on art practices using the then new technologies for the capture, inter-machine transfer, printing and transmission of images, as well as the exploration of the aspect of time in the transformation of image information.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Sonia Landy. ''Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas'', Leonardo, 16(2), 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Clauser &lt;ref&gt;Clauser, H. R. ''Towards a Dynamic, Generative Computer Art'', Leonardo, 21(2), 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; identified the aspect of systemic autonomy as a critical element in generative art:

 {{quotation | It should be evident from the above description of the evolution of generative art that process (or structuring) and change (or transformation) are among its most definitive features, and that these features and the very term 'generative' imply dynamic development and motion. ...

(the result) is not a creation by the artist but rather the product of the generative process - a self-precipitating structure. }}

In 1989 Celestino Soddu defined the Generative Design approach to Architecture and Town Design in his book ''Citta' Aleatorie''.&lt;ref&gt;Soddu, C.  Citta' Aleatorie, Masson Publisher 1989 "[http://www.artscience-ebookshop.com/cittaaleatorie_book.htm]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Franke referred to "generative mathematics" as "the study of mathematical operations suitable for generating artistic images."&lt;ref&gt;Franke, H. W.''Mathematics As an Artistic-Generative Principle'', Leonardo, Supplemental Issue, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-1990s [[Brian Eno]] popularized the terms [[generative music]] and generative systems, making a connection with earlier [[experimental music]] by [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]] and [[Philip Glass]].&lt;ref&gt;Eno, B. ''[http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/eno1.html  Generative Music]'', In Motion Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

From the end of the 20th century, communities of generative artists, designers, musicians and theoreticians began to meet, forming cross-disciplinary perspectives.  
The first meeting about generative Art was in 1998, at the inaugural International Generative Art conference at Politecnico di Milano University, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Soddu, C. and Colabella, E. ed.s "[http://www.artscience-ebookshop.com/ga98_book.htm Generative Art]", Dedalo&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Australia, the Iterate conference on generative systems in the electronic arts followed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~iterate/FI/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  
On-line discussion has centred around the eu-gene mailing list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727083144/http://generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene |archivedate=2012-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which began late 1999, and has hosted much of the debate which has defined the field.&lt;ref name="Galanter2003" /&gt;{{rp|1}}  These activities have more recently been joined by the [http://www.generatorx.no/generatorx-introduction/ Generator.x] conference in Berlin starting in 2005.
In 2012 the new journal GASATHJ, Generative Art Science and Technology Hard Journal was founded by Celestino Soddu and Enrica Colabella &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasathj.com  GASATHJ]&lt;/ref&gt; jointing several generative artists and scientists in the Editorial Board.

Some have argued that as a result of this engagement across disciplinary boundaries, the community has converged on a shared meaning of the term.  As Boden and Edmonds&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; put it in 2011:

{{quotation | Today, the term "Generative Art" is still current within the relevant artistic community. Since 1998  a series  of  conferences  have been  held  in Milan with  that  title (Generativeart.com), and Brian Eno has been inﬂuential in promoting and using generative art methods (Eno, 1996). Both in music and in visual art, the use of the term has now converged on work that has been produced by the activation of a set of rules and where the artist lets a computer system take over at least some of the decision-making (although, of course, the artist determines the rules).}}

In the call of the Generative Art conferences in Milan (annually starting from 1998), the definition of Generative Art by Celestino Soddu:

{{quotation | Generative Art is the idea realized as genetic code of artificial events, as construction of dynamic complex systems able to generate endless variations. Each Generative Project is a concept-software that works producing unique and non-repeatable events, like music or 3D Objects, as possible and manifold expressions of the generating idea strongly recognizable as a vision belonging to an artist / designer / musician / architect /mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generativeart.com Generative Art]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Discussion on the eu-gene mailing list was framed by the following definition by [[Adrian Ward (artist)|Adrian Ward]] from 1999:

{{quotation | Generative art is a term given to work which stems from concentrating on the processes involved in producing an artwork, usually (although not strictly) automated by the use of a machine or computer, or by using mathematic or pragmatic instructions to define the rules by which such artworks are executed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000901084825/http://www.generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene eu-gene mailing list welcome page]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A similar definition is provided by Philip Galanter:&lt;ref name="Galanter2003" /&gt;
{{quotation | Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist creates a process, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is then set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.}}

==Types==

===Music===
{{Main article|Generative music}}
[[Johann Philipp Kirnberger]]'s "[[Musikalisches Würfelspiel]]" (Musical Dice Game) 1757 is considered an early example of a generative system based on randomness. Dice were used to select musical sequences from a numbered pool of previously composed phrases. This system provided a balance of order and disorder. The structure was based on an element of order on one hand, and disorder on the other.&lt;ref name="Algorithmic"&gt;Nierhaus, Gerhard (2009). ''Algorithmic Composition: Paradigms of Automated Music Generation'', pp. 36 &amp; 38n7. {{ISBN|9783211755396}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fugues]] of [[J.S. Bach]] could be considered generative, in that there is a strict underlying process that is followed by the composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Tim|title=Fugue 9: E Major.

Composers such as [[John Cage]],&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]] ''Digital Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13–15}} [[Farmers Manual]] and [[Brian Eno]]&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;{{rp|133}} have used [[generative systems]] in their works.

===Visual art===
The artist [[Ellsworth Kelly]] created paintings by using chance operations to assign colors in a grid. He also created works on paper that he then cut into strips or squares and reassembled using chance operations to determine placement.&lt;ref&gt;Yve-Alain Bois, Jack Cowart, Alfred Pacquement ''Ellsworth Kelly: The Years in France, 1948-1954'', Washington DC, National Gallery of Art, Prestel, p. 23-26&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists such as [[Hans Haacke]] have explored processes of physical and social systems in artistic context.  
[[François Morellet]] has used both highly ordered and highly disordered systems in his artwork.  Some of his paintings feature regular systems of radial or parallel lines to create [[Moiré Patterns]]. In other works he has used chance operations to determine the coloration of grids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue16/colourchart3.htm Tate Online Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325054818/http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue16/colourchart3.htm |date=2012-03-25 }} about [[François Morellet]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck "Francois Morellet, Austere Abtractionism", New York Times, Feb. 22, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sol LeWitt]] created generative art in the form of systems expressed in [[natural language]] and systems of geometric [[permutation]].

The French artist [[Jean-Max Albert]], beside environmental sculptures like ''Iapetus'',&lt;ref&gt;Michel Ragon, Jean-Max Albert «Iapetus», L’art abstrait vol.5, Éditions Maeght, Paris, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and ''O=C=O'',&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Max Albert O=C=O, Franco Torriani, Dalla Land arte alla bioarte, Hopefulmonster editore Torino, 2007, p. 64-70&lt;/ref&gt; developed a project dedicated to the vegetation itself, in terms of biological activity. The ''Calmoduline Monument'' project is based on the property of a protein, [[calmodulin]], to bond selectively to calcium. Exterior physical constraints (wind, rain, etc.) modify the electric potential of the cellular membranes of a plant and consequently the flux of calcium. However, the calcium controls the expression of the calmoduline gene.&lt;ref&gt;Intra-and Intercellular Communications in Plants, Millet &amp; Greppin Editors, INRA, Paris, 1980, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; The plant can thus, when there is a stimulus, modify its « typical » growth pattern. So the basic principle of this monumental sculpture is that to the extent that they could be picked up and transported, these signals could be enlarged, translated into colors and shapes, and show the plant’s « decisions » suggesting a level of fundamental biological activity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/L_espace_de_profil.html?id=PAlPAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Space in profile/ L'espace de profil,'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software art===
{{Main article|Software Art}}

===Literature===

Writers such as [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Brion Gysin]], and [[William Burroughs]] used the [[cut-up technique]] to introduce randomization to literature as a generative system. [[Jackson Mac Low]] produced computer-assisted poetry and used algorithms to generate texts; [[Philip M. Parker#Automatically generated books|Philip M. Parker]] has written software to automatically generate entire books. [[Jason Nelson]] used generative methods with Speech-to-Text software to create a series of digital poems from movies, television and other audio sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Flores |first1=Leonardo |title=The Battery Life of Meaning: Speech to Text Poetry” |url=http://iloveepoetry.com/?p=324 |website=I love E-Poetry |accessdate=9 February 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704155151/http://iloveepoetry.com/?p=324 |archivedate=4 July 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live coding===
{{Main article|Live coding}}
Generative systems may be modified while they operate, for example by using interactive programming environments such as [[Max/MSP]], [[vvvv]], [[Fluxus (programming environment)|Fluxus]], [[Isadora (software)|Isadora]], [[Quartz Composer]] and [[openFrameworks]]. This is a standard approach to programming by artists, but may also be used to create live music and/or video by manipulating generative systems on stage, a performance practice that has become known as [[live coding]]. As with many examples of [[software art]], because live coding emphasises human authorship rather than autonomy, it may be considered in opposition to generative art.&lt;ref name=McLean11&gt;{{cite book |last=McLean |first=Alex |title=Artist-Programmers and Programming Languages for the Arts |year=2011 |publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London (PhD Thesis)|pages=16–17 |url=http://yaxu.org/writing/thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Philip Galanter===

In the most widely cited theory of generative art, in 2003 Philip Galanter&lt;ref name="Galanter2003"&gt;Philip Galanter [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/ga2003_what_is_genart.pdf ''What is Generative Art? Complexity theory as a context for art theory''], 2003 International Conference on Generative Art&lt;/ref&gt; describes generative art systems in the context of complexity theory. In particular the notion of [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Seth Lloyd]]'s [[effective complexity]] is cited. In this view both highly ordered and highly disordered generative art can be viewed as simple. Highly ordered generative art minimizes [[entropy]] and allows maximal [[data compression]], and highly disordered generative art maximizes entropy and disallows significant data compression. Maximally complex generative art blends order and disorder in a manner similar to biological life, and indeed biologically inspired methods are most frequently used to create complex generative art. This view is at odds with the earlier [[information theory]] influenced views of [[Max Bense]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Bense|Bense, Max]] ''Aesthetica; Einfuehrung in die neue Aesthetik'', Agis-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abraham Moles]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Moles|Moles, Abraham]]. ''Information theory and esthetic perception'', University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt; where complexity in art increases with disorder.

Galanter notes further that given the use of visual symmetry, pattern, and repetition by the most ancient known cultures generative art is as old as art itself. He also addresses the mistaken equivalence by some that rule-based art is synonymous with generative art. For example, some art is based on constraint rules that disallow the use of certain colors or shapes. Such art is not generative because constraint rules are not constructive, i.e. by themselves they don't assert what is to be done, only what cannot be done.&lt;ref&gt;Galanter, Philip. [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/vague_terrain_2006.pdf ''Generative art and rules-based art.''], Vague Terrain (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Margaret Boden and Ernest Edmonds===

In their 2009 article, [[Margaret Boden]] and Ernest Edmonds agree that generative art need not be restricted to that done using computers, and that some rule-based art is not generative. They develop a technical vocabulary that includes Ele-art (electronic art), C-art ([[computer art]]), D-art (digital art), CA-art (computer assisted art), G-art (generative art), CG-art (computer based generative art), Evo-art (evolutionary based art), R-art (robotic art), I-art (interactive art), CI-art (computer based interactive art), and VR-art (virtual reality art).&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt;
&lt;!--
In both accounts the term generative art does not describe an [[art movement]], [[ideology]], or theory of [[aesthetics]]. The term refers to how the art is made, and does not take into account why it was made or what the content of the artwork is.--&gt;&lt;!--this is WP:OR, an editor's opinion--&gt;

=== Questions ===

The discourse around generative art can be characterised by the theoretical questions which motivate its development. McCormack et al. propose the following questions, shown with paraphrased summaries, as the most important:&lt;ref name=McC&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCormack |first=Jon |author2=Oliver Bown |author3=Alan Dorin |author4=Jonathan McCabe |author5=Gordon Monro |author6=Mitchell Whitelaw |title=Ten Questions Concerning Generative Computer Art |journal=Leonardo |year=forthcoming |url=http://diotima.infotech.monash.edu.au/~jonmc/sa/news/ten-questions-concerning-generative-computer-art/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121129225520/http://diotima.infotech.monash.edu.au/~jonmc/sa/news/ten-questions-concerning-generative-computer-art/ |archivedate=2012-11-29 |date=2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Can a machine originate anything?  ''Related to [[machine intelligence]] - can a machine generate something new, meaningful, surprising and of value: a poem, an artwork, a useful idea, a solution to a long-standing problem?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What is it like to be a computer that makes art?  ''If a computer could originate art, what would it be like from the computer's perspective?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# Can human aesthetics be formalised?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What new kinds of art does the computer enable?  ''Many generative artworks do not involve digital computers, but what does generative computer art bring that is new?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# In what sense is generative art representational, and what is it representing?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What is the role of randomness in generative art? ''For example, what does the use of randomness say about the place of intentionality in the making of art?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What can computational generative art tell us about creativity? ''How could generative art give rise to artefacts and ideas that are new, surprising and valuable?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What characterises good generative art? ''How can we form a more critical understanding of generative art?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What can we learn about art from generative art? ''For example, can the art world be considered a complex generative system involving many processes outside the direct control of artists, who are agents of production within a stratified global art market.''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What future developments would force us to rethink our answers?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;

Another question is of postmodernism—are generative art systems the ultimate expression of the postmodern condition, or do they point to a new synthesis based on a complexity-inspired world-view?&lt;ref&gt;Galanter, Philip. [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/complexism_chapter.pdf ''Complexism and the role of evolutionary art''] in "The art of artificial evolution : a handbook on evolutionary art and music", Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graded absolutism''' is a theory of [[moral absolutism]] in [[Christian ethics]] which resolves the objection to absolutism that in moral conflicts we are obligated to opposites.  Moral absolutism is the [[Ethics|ethical]] view that certain actions are absolutely right or wrong regardless of other contexts such as their consequences or the intentions behind them.  Graded absolutism is moral absolutism but qualifies that a moral absolute, like "Do not kill," can be greater or lesser than another moral absolute, like "Do not lie". Also called contextual absolutism or the greater good view, is an alternative to the third alternative view and the [[Lesser of two evils principle|lesser evil view]], both discussed below, regarding moral conflict resolution.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

According to graded absolutism, in [[Ethical dilemma|moral conflicts]], the dilemma is not that we are obligated to opposites, because greater absolutes are not opposites of lesser absolutes, and evil is not the opposite of good but is instead the privation of good.  Since evil is the privation of good, only the privation of the greater good counts as evil, since whenever there is a moral conflict, we are only obligated to the greater good.  The real dilemma is that we cannot perform both conflicting absolutes at the same time.  'Which' absolutes are in conflict depends on the context, but which conflicting absolute is ‘greater’ does not depend on the context. That is why graded absolutism is also called 'contextual absolutism' but is not to be confused with [[situational ethics]]. The conflict is resolved in acting according to the greater absolute. That is why graded absolutism is also called the 'greater good view', but is not to be confused with [[utilitarianism]].

==The third alternative view==

This is the view that there are never any real moral conflicts and that there is always a third alternative. For example, instead of answering in the affirmative or negative to the Nazi at the door, one may simply withhold an answer.

==The lesser evil view==

[[Lesser of two evils principle|The lesser evil view]] is the view that the only way out of a moral conflict is to violate one of the moral absolutes and choose the lesser evil.  For example, if we disagree with [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s thoughts on the [[categorical imperative]] and say that lying is a lesser evil than helping a would-be murderer, the lesser evil view would have us lie rather than help a would-be murderer.  According to the proponent of graded absolutism, this violates the [[ought implies can]] principle and defeats itself in obligating evil.

==The greater good view==

The greater good view is the view that there are real moral conflicts between absolutes, but rather than requiring a third alternative (as in the case of the third alternative view above) or obligating evil (as in the case of the lesser evil view above), this view obligates the greater absolute, or greater good.  For example, when one saves a life rather than telling the truth to a would-be murderer, one is committing the greater good of saving life, rather than violating the lesser good of telling the truth or committing the lesser (than aiding a murderer) evil of lying.  Since evil is the privation of good, only the privation of the greater good counts as evil, since whenever there is a moral conflict, we are only obligated to the greater good.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—are brought toward (or ''gravitate'' toward) one another.  On [[Earth]], gravity gives [[weight]] to [[physical body|physical objects]], and the [[Moon]]'s [[gravitation of the Moon|gravity]] causes the ocean [[tide]]s. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the [[Universe]] caused it to begin [[coalescence (physics)|coalescing]], [[star formation|forming stars]]{{snd}}and for the stars to group together into galaxies{{snd}}so gravity is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects.

Gravity is most accurately described by the [[general theory of relativity]] (proposed by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1915) which describes gravity not as a [[force]], but as a consequence of the [[curvature of spacetime]] caused by the uneven distribution of mass. The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a [[black hole]], from which nothing—not even light—can escape once past the black hole's event horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hubblesite.org/explore_astronomy/black_holes/home.html|title=HubbleSite: Black Holes: Gravity's Relentless Pull|website=hubblesite.org|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], which describes gravity as a force which causes any two bodies to be attracted to each other, with the force [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the product of their masses and [[inversely proportional]] to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[distance]] between them.&lt;!---This is considered{{by whom|date=February 2016}} to occur over an infinite range, such that all bodies (with mass) in the Universe are drawn to each other no matter how far they are apart.{{citation needed|date=February 2016|reason=infinite range claim is not supported in the body of this article}}---&gt;

Gravity is the weakest of the four [[fundamental force]]s of physics, approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; times weaker than the [[Strong interaction|strong force]], 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; times weaker than the [[electromagnetic force]] and 10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; times weaker than the [[Weak interaction|weak force]]. As a consequence, it has no significant influence at the level of subatomic particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Scientific Development and Misconceptions Through the Ages: A Reference Guide |edition=illustrated |first1=Robert E. |last1=Krebs |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-313-30226-8 |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iApVikcj9UC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=4iApVikcj9UC&amp;pg=PA133 Extract of page 133]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, it is the dominant force at the [[macroscopic scale]], and is the cause of the formation, shape and [[trajectory]] ([[orbit]]) of [[astronomical bodies]].  For example, gravity causes the Earth and the other planets to orbit the Sun, it also causes the [[Moon]] to orbit the Earth, and causes the formation of [[tide]]s, the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]], [[stellar evolution|stars]] and [[galaxy formation and evolution|galaxies]].

The earliest instance of gravity in the Universe, possibly in the form of [[quantum gravity]], [[supergravity]] or a [[gravitational singularity]], along with ordinary [[space]] and [[time]], developed during the [[Timeline of the formation of the Universe#Planck epoch|Planck epoch]] (up to 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the [[Big Bang|birth]] of the Universe), possibly from a primeval state, such as a [[false vacuum]], [[quantum vacuum]] or [[virtual particle]], in a currently unknown manner.&lt;ref name="Planck-UOregon"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Birth of the Universe |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec20.html |date= |website=[[University of Oregon]] |accessdate=24 September 2016 }} – discusses "[[Planck time]]" and "[[Planck era]]" at the [[Big Bang|very beginning]] of the Universe&lt;/ref&gt;  Attempts to develop a theory of gravity consistent with [[quantum mechanics]], a [[quantum gravity]] theory, which would allow gravity to be united in a common mathematical framework (a [[theory of everything]]) with the other three forces of physics, are a current area of research.

===Scientific revolution===
{{main|Scientific revolution}}
Modern work on gravitational theory began with the work of [[Galileo Galilei]] in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

This was a major departure from [[Aristotle]]'s belief that heavier objects have a higher gravitational acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Galileo]] (1638), ''[[Two New Sciences]]'', [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=753&amp;chapter=109891&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 First Day] Salviati speaks: "If this were what Aristotle meant you would burden him with another error which would amount to a falsehood; because, since there is no such sheer height available on earth, it is clear that Aristotle could not have made the experiment; yet he wishes to give us the impression of his having performed it when he speaks of such an effect as one which we see."&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo postulated [[air resistance]] as the reason that objects with less mass fall more slowly in an atmosphere.

===Newton's theory of gravitation===
{{main|Newton's law of universal gravitation}}
[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|English physicist and mathematician, [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] (1642-1727)]]
In 1687, English mathematician Sir [[Isaac Newton]] published ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', which hypothesizes the [[inverse-square law]] of universal gravitation. In his own words, "I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must [be] reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about which they revolve: and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the Moon in her Orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the Earth; and found them answer pretty nearly."&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book

As early as 1645 [[Ismaël Bullialdus]] had argued that any force exerted by the Sun on distant objects would have to follow an inverse-square law.  However, he also dismissed the idea that any such force did exist. See, for example,

&lt;/ref&gt; The equation is the following:

&lt;math&gt;F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\ &lt;/math&gt;

Where ''F'' is the force, ''m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the masses of the objects interacting, ''r'' is the distance between the centers of the masses and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].

Newton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of [[Neptune]] based on motions of [[Uranus]] that could not be accounted for by the actions of the other planets. Calculations by both [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]] predicted the general position of the planet, and Le Verrier's calculations are what led [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] to the discovery of Neptune.

A discrepancy in [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit pointed out flaws in Newton's theory. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that its orbit showed slight perturbations that could not be accounted for entirely under Newton's theory, but all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) had been fruitless. The issue was resolved in 1915 by [[Albert Einstein]]'s new theory of [[general relativity]], which accounted for the small discrepancy in Mercury's orbit. This discrepancy was the advance in the perihelion of Mercury of 42.98 arcseconds per century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nobil|first=Anna M.|date=March 1986|title=The real value of Mercury's perihelion advance|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/320039a0|journal=Nature|volume=320|issue=6057|pages=39–41|via=|bibcode=1986Natur.320...39N|doi=10.1038/320039a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Newton's theory has been superseded by [[Einstein]]'s general relativity, most modern [[Theory of relativity|non-relativistic]] gravitational calculations are still made using Newton's theory because it is simpler to work with and it gives sufficiently accurate results for most applications involving sufficiently small masses, speeds and energies.

===Equivalence principle===
The [[equivalence principle]], explored by a succession of researchers including Galileo, [[Loránd Eötvös]], and Einstein, expresses the idea that all objects fall in the same way, and that the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from certain aspects of acceleration and deceleration.  The simplest way to test the weak equivalence principle is to drop two objects of different masses or compositions in a vacuum and see whether they hit the ground at the same time. Such experiments demonstrate that all objects fall at the same rate when other forces (such as air resistance and electromagnetic effects) are negligible. More sophisticated tests use a torsion balance of a type invented by Eötvös. Satellite experiments, for example [[STEP (satellite)|STEP]], are planned for more accurate experiments in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=M.C.W.Sandford |publisher=[[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] |title=STEP: Satellite Test of the Equivalence Principle |url=http://www.sstd.rl.ac.uk/fundphys/step/ |date=2008 |accessdate=2011-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928041608/http://www.sstd.rl.ac.uk/fundphys/step/ |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formulations of the equivalence principle include:

===General relativity===
{{see also|Introduction to general relativity}}

Matter changes the geometry of spacetime, this (curved) geometry being interpreted as gravity. White lines do not represent the curvature of space but instead represent the [[coordinate system]] imposed on the curved spacetime, which would be [[regular grid|rectilinear]] in a flat spacetime.]]
{{General relativity sidebar}}
In [[general relativity]], the effects of gravitation are ascribed to [[spacetime]] [[curvature]] instead of a force. The starting point for general relativity is the [[equivalence principle]], which equates free fall with inertial motion and describes free-falling inertial objects as being accelerated relative to non-inertial observers on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.black-holes.org/relativity6.html |title=Gravity and Warped Spacetime |publisher=black-holes.org |accessdate=2010-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621005940/http://www.black-holes.org/relativity6.html |archivedate=21 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lecture 20: Black Holes—The Einstein Equivalence Principle |author=Dmitri Pogosyan |url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~pogosyan/teaching/ASTRO_122/lect20/lecture20.html |publisher=University of Alberta |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Newtonian physics]], however, no such acceleration can occur unless at least one of the objects is being operated on by a force.

Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along locally straight paths in curved spacetime. These straight paths are called [[geodesic (general relativity)|geodesics]]. Like Newton's first law of motion, Einstein's theory states that if a force is applied on an object, it would deviate from a geodesic.  For instance, we are no longer following geodesics while standing because the mechanical resistance of the Earth exerts an upward force on us, and we are non-inertial on the ground as a result. This explains why moving along the geodesics in spacetime is considered inertial.

Einstein discovered the [[field equation]]s of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime and are named after him. The [[Einstein field equations]] are a set of 10 [[simultaneous equations|simultaneous]], [[nonlinear system|non-linear]], [[differential equation]]s. The solutions of the field equations are the components of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] of spacetime. A metric tensor describes a geometry of spacetime. The geodesic paths for a spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.

====Solutions====
Notable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:
* The [[Schwarzschild solution]], which describes spacetime surrounding a [[Circular symmetry|spherically symmetric]] non-[[rotation|rotating]] uncharged massive object. For compact enough objects, this solution generated a [[black hole]] with a central [[gravitational singularity|singularity]]. For radial distances from the center which are much greater than the [[Schwarzschild radius]], the accelerations predicted by the Schwarzschild solution are practically identical to those predicted by Newton's theory of gravity.
* The [[Reissner–Nordström metric|Reissner-Nordström solution]], in which the central object has an electrical charge. For charges with a [[geometrized]] length which are less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution produces black holes with double [[event horizon]]s.
* The [[Kerr metric|Kerr solution]] for rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple event horizons.
* The [[Kerr–Newman metric|Kerr-Newman solution]] for charged, rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple event horizons.
* The [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker solution]], which predicts the expansion of the Universe.

====Tests====
The [[tests of general relativity]] included the following:&lt;ref name=Pauli1958&gt;{{cite book|last=Pauli|first=Wolfgang Ernst|title=Theory of Relativity|date=1958|isbn=978-0-486-64152-2|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|chapter=Part IV. General Theory of Relativity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The prediction that time runs slower at lower potentials ([[gravitational time dilation]]) has been confirmed by the [[Pound–Rebka experiment]] (1959), the [[Hafele–Keating experiment]], and the [[GPS#Predecessors|GPS]].
* The prediction of the deflection of light was first confirmed by [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]] from his observations during the [[Solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dyson|first1=F.W.|authorlink1=Frank Watson Dyson|last2= Eddington|first2=A.S.|authorlink2=Arthur Eddington|last3=Davidson|first3=C.R. |date=1920 |title=A Determination of the Deflection of Light by the Sun's Gravitational Field, from Observations Made at the Total Eclipse of May 29, 1919|journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|Phil.

* The [[time delay of light]] passing close to a massive object was first identified by [[Irwin I. Shapiro]] in 1964 in interplanetary spacecraft signals.
* [[Gravitational radiation]] has been indirectly confirmed through studies of binary [[pulsar]]s. On 11 February 2016, the [[LIGO]] and [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]] collaborations announced the first observation of a gravitational wave.
* [[Alexander Friedmann]] in 1922 found that Einstein equations have non-stationary solutions (even in the presence of the [[cosmological constant]]). In 1927 [[Georges Lemaître]] showed that static solutions of the Einstein equations, which are possible in the presence of the cosmological constant, are unstable, and therefore the static Universe envisioned by Einstein could not exist. Later, in 1931, Einstein himself agreed with the results of Friedmann and Lemaître. Thus general relativity predicted that the Universe had to be non-static—it had to either expand or contract. The expansion of the Universe discovered by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929 confirmed this prediction.&lt;ref name=Pauli1&gt;See W.Pauli, 1958, pp. 219–20&lt;/ref&gt;
* The theory's prediction of [[frame dragging]] was consistent with the recent [[Gravity Probe B]] results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2011/may/HQ_11-134_Gravity_Probe_B.html |title=NASA's Gravity Probe B Confirms Two Einstein Space-Time Theories |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* General relativity predicts that light should lose [[photon energy|its energy]] when traveling away from massive bodies through [[gravitational redshift]]. This was verified on earth and in the solar system around 1960.

===Gravity and quantum mechanics===
{{Main|Graviton|Quantum gravity}}
In the decades after the publication of the theory of general relativity, it was realized that general relativity is incompatible with [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref name="Randall, Lisa 2005"&gt;{{cite book | author=Randall, Lisa | title=Warped Passages: Unraveling the Universe's Hidden Dimensions | publisher=Ecco | date=2005 | isbn=978-0-06-053108-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to describe gravity in the framework of [[quantum field theory]] like the other [[fundamental forces]], such that the attractive force of gravity arises due to exchange of [[virtual particle|virtual]] gravitons, in the same way as the electromagnetic force arises from exchange of virtual [[photon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Feynman |first= R.

However, this approach fails at short distances of the order of the [[Planck length]],&lt;ref name="Randall, Lisa 2005"/&gt; where a more complete theory of quantum gravity (or a new approach to quantum mechanics) is required.

===Earth's gravity===
[[File:Falling ball.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|An initially-stationary object that is allowed to fall freely under gravity drops a distance that is proportional to the square of the elapsed time. This image spans half a second and was captured at 20 flashes per second.]]
{{main|Earth's gravity}}
Every planetary body (including the Earth) is surrounded by its own gravitational field, which can be conceptualized with Newtonian physics as exerting an attractive force on all objects. Assuming a spherically symmetrical planet, the strength of this field at any given point above the surface is proportional to the planetary body's mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of the body.
[[File:Gravity action-reaction.gif|thumb|upright=0.7|left|If an object with comparable mass to that of the Earth were to fall towards it, then the corresponding acceleration of the Earth would be observable.]]
The strength of the gravitational field is numerically equal to the acceleration of objects under its influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Companion to the History of Modern Science |first1=G.N. |last1=Cantor |first2=J.R.R. |last2=Christie |first3=M.J.S. |last3=Hodge |first4=R.C. |last4=Olby |publisher=Routledge |year=2006 |isbn=    978-1-134-97751-2 |page=448 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkJn6ciwYZsC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=gkJn6ciwYZsC&amp;pg=PA448 Extract of page 448]&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of acceleration of falling objects near the Earth's surface varies very slightly depending on latitude, surface features such as mountains and ridges, and perhaps unusually high or low sub-surface densities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD|date = 15 December 2014|title = The Potsdam Gravity Potato|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For purposes of weights and measures, a [[standard gravity]] value is defined by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]], under the [[International System of Units]] (SI).

The standard value of 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the one originally adopted by the International Committee on Weights and Measures in 1901 for 45° latitude, even though it has been shown to be too high by about five parts in ten thousand.&lt;ref name=List&gt;List, R. J. editor, 1968, Acceleration of Gravity, ''Smithsonian Meteorological Tables'', Sixth Ed. Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; This value has persisted in meteorology and in some standard atmospheres as the value for 45° latitude even though it applies more precisely to latitude of 45°32'33".&lt;ref name=USSA1976&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19770009539_1977009539.pdf U.S. Standard Atmosphere], 1976, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1976. (Linked file is very large.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming the standardized value for g and ignoring air resistance, this means that an object falling freely near the Earth's surface increases its velocity by 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s (32.1740&amp;nbsp;ft/s or 22&amp;nbsp;mph) for each second of its descent. Thus, an object starting from rest will attain a velocity of 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s (32.1740&amp;nbsp;ft/s) after one second, approximately 19.62&amp;nbsp;m/s (64.4&amp;nbsp;ft/s) after two seconds, and so on, adding 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s (32.1740&amp;nbsp;ft/s) to each resulting velocity. Also, again ignoring air resistance, any and all objects, when dropped from the same height, will hit the ground at the same time.

According to [[Newton's 3rd law|Newton's 3rd Law]], the Earth itself experiences a [[Newtons|force]] equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that which it exerts on a falling object.  This means that the Earth also accelerates towards the object until they collide.  Because the mass of the Earth is huge, however, the acceleration imparted to the Earth by this opposite force is negligible in comparison to the object's.  If the object doesn't bounce after it has collided with the Earth, each of them then exerts a repulsive [[contact force]] on the other which effectively balances the attractive force of gravity and prevents further acceleration.

The force of gravity on Earth is the resultant (vector sum) of two forces:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (a) The gravitational attraction in accordance with Newton's universal law of gravitation, and (b) the centrifugal force, which results from the choice of an earthbound, rotating frame of reference.  The force of gravity is the weakest at the equator because of the centrifugal force caused by the Earth's rotation and because points on the equator are furthest from the center of the Earth.  The force of gravity varies with latitude and increases from about 9.780&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the Equator to about 9.832&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the poles.

===Equations for a falling body near the surface of the Earth===
{{main|Equations for a falling body}}
Under an assumption of constant gravitational attraction, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] simplifies to ''F'' = ''mg'', where ''m'' is the [[mass]] of the body and ''g'' is a constant vector with an average magnitude of 9.81&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on Earth. This resulting force is the object's weight. The acceleration due to gravity is equal to this ''g''. An initially stationary object which is allowed to fall freely under gravity drops a distance which is proportional to the square of the elapsed time. The image on the right, spanning half a second, was captured with a stroboscopic flash at 20 flashes per second. During the first {{frac|20}} of a second the ball drops one unit of distance (here, a unit is about 12&amp;nbsp;mm); by {{frac|2|20}} it has dropped at total of 4 units; by {{frac|3|20}}, 9 units and so on.

Under the same constant gravity assumptions, the [[potential energy]], ''E''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, of a body at height ''h'' is given by ''E''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = ''mgh'' (or ''E''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Wh'', with ''W'' meaning weight). This expression is valid only over small distances ''h'' from the surface of the Earth. Similarly, the expression &lt;math&gt;h = \tfrac{v^2}{2g}&lt;/math&gt; for the maximum height reached by a vertically projected body with initial velocity ''v'' is useful for small heights and small initial velocities only.

The application of Newton's law of gravity has enabled the acquisition of much of the detailed information we have about the planets in the Solar System, the mass of the Sun, and details of [[quasar]]s; even the existence of [[dark matter]] is inferred using Newton's law of gravity. Although we have not traveled to all the planets nor to the Sun, we know their masses. These masses are obtained by applying the laws of gravity to the measured characteristics of the orbit. In space an object maintains its [[orbit]] because of the force of gravity acting upon it. Planets orbit stars, stars orbit [[bulge (astronomy)|galactic centers]], galaxies orbit a center of mass in clusters, and clusters orbit in [[supercluster]]s. The force of gravity exerted on one object by another is directly proportional to the product of those objects' masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

The earliest gravity (possibly in the form of quantum gravity, [[supergravity]] or a [[gravitational singularity]]), along with ordinary space and time, developed during the [[Timeline of the formation of the Universe#Planck Epoch|Planck epoch]] (up to 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the [[Big Bang|birth]] of the Universe), possibly from a primeval state (such as a [[false vacuum]], [[quantum vacuum]] or [[virtual particle]]), in a currently unknown manner.&lt;ref name="Planck-UOregon"/&gt;

===Gravitational radiation===
[[File:LIGO Hanford aerial 05.jpg|alt=LIGO Hanford Observatory|thumb|The [[LIGO]] Hanford Observatory located in Washington, US where gravitational waves were first observed in September 2015.]]
{{Main|Gravitational wave}}
According to general relativity, gravitational radiation is generated in situations where the curvature of [[spacetime]] is oscillating, such as is the case with co-orbiting objects. The gravitational radiation emitted by the [[Solar System]] is far too small to measure. However, gravitational radiation has been indirectly observed as an energy loss over time in binary pulsar systems such as [[PSR B1913+16]]. It is believed that [[neutron star]] mergers and [[black hole]] formation may create detectable amounts of gravitational radiation. Gravitational radiation observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory ([[LIGO]]) have been created to study the problem. In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole collision. On 14 September 2015, LIGO registered gravitational waves for the first time, as a result of the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion light-years from Earth.&lt;ref name='Clark 2016'&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gravitational waves: scientists announce 'we did it!'{{snd}}live|url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/live/2016/feb/11/gravitational-wave-announcement-latest-physics-einstein-ligo-black-holes-live|website = the Guardian|date=2016-02-11|access-date = 2016-02-11|first = Stuart|last = Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Discovery 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Einstein's gravitational waves found at last |journal=Nature News|url=http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-gravitational-waves-found-at-last-1.19361 |date=11 February 2016 |last=Castelvecchi |first=Davide |last2=Witze |first2=Witze |doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19361  |accessdate=2016-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This observation confirms the theoretical predictions of Einstein and others that such waves exist. The event confirms that [[binary black hole]]s exist. It also opens the way for practical observation and understanding of the nature of gravity and events in the Universe including the Big Bang and what happened after it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHAT ARE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES AND WHY DO THEY MATTER?|url=http://www.popsci.com/whats-so-important-about-gravitational-waves|publisher=popsci.com|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speed of gravity===
{{Main|Speed of gravity}}
In December 2012, a research team in China announced that it had produced measurements of the phase lag of [[Earth tide]]s during full and new moons which seem to prove that the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrowatch.net/2012/12/chinese-scientists-find-evidence-for.html Chinese scientists find evidence for speed of gravity], astrowatch.com, 12/28/12.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that if the Sun suddenly disappeared, the Earth would keep orbiting it normally for 8 minutes, which is the time light takes to travel that distance. The team's findings were released in the [[Chinese Science Bulletin]] in February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=TANG|first=Ke Yun|author2=HUA ChangCai |author3=WEN Wu |author4=CHI ShunLiang |author5=YOU QingYu |author6=YU Dan |title=Observational evidences for the speed of the gravity based on the Earth tide|journal=Chinese Science Bulletin|date=February 2013|volume=58|issue=4–5|pages=474–77|doi=10.1007/s11434-012-5603-3|bibcode=2013ChSBu..58..474T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the [[LIGO]] and Virgo detectors received gravitational wave signals within 2 seconds of gamma ray satellites and optical telescopes seeing signals from the same direction. This confirmed that the speed of gravitational waves was the same as the speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/press-release-gw170817|title=GW170817 Press Release|website=LIGO Lab - Caltech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anomalies and discrepancies==
There are some observations that are not adequately accounted for, which may point to the need for better theories of gravity or perhaps be explained in other ways.
[[File:GalacticRotation2.svg|frame|right|Rotation curve of a typical spiral galaxy: predicted ('''A''') and observed ('''B'''). The discrepancy between the curves is attributed to [[dark matter]].]]
* '''Extra-fast stars''': Stars in galaxies follow a [[Galaxy rotation curve|distribution of velocities]] where stars on the outskirts are moving faster than they should according to the observed distributions of normal matter. Galaxies within [[Galaxy groups and clusters|galaxy clusters]] show a similar pattern. [[Dark matter]], which would interact through gravitation but not electromagnetically, would account for the discrepancy. Various [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|modifications to Newtonian dynamics]] have also been proposed.
* '''[[Flyby anomaly]]''': Various spacecraft have experienced greater acceleration than expected during [[gravity assist]] maneuvers.
* '''Accelerating expansion''': The [[metric expansion of space]] seems to be speeding up. [[Dark energy]] has been proposed to explain this. A recent alternative explanation is that the geometry of space is not homogeneous (due to clusters of galaxies) and that when the data are reinterpreted to take this into account, the expansion is not speeding up after all,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/astronomy/cosmology/mg19726461.600-dark-energy-may-just-be-a-cosmic-illusion.html Dark energy may just be a cosmic illusion], ''New Scientist'', issue 2646, 7 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; however this conclusion is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026783.800-swisscheese-model-of-the-cosmos-is-full-of-holes.html Swiss-cheese model of the cosmos is full of holes], ''New Scientist'', issue 2678, 18 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Anomalous increase of the [[astronomical unit]]''': Recent measurements indicate that [[Astronomical unit#Developments|planetary orbits are widening]] faster than if this were solely through the Sun losing mass by radiating energy.
* '''Extra energetic photons''': Photons travelling through galaxy clusters should gain energy and then lose it again on the way out. The accelerating expansion of the Universe should stop the photons returning all the energy, but even taking this into account photons from the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] gain twice as much energy as expected. This may indicate that gravity falls off ''faster'' than inverse-squared at certain distance scales.&lt;ref name=newsci2699&gt;{{cite web|last=Chown|first=Marcus|title=Gravity may venture where matter fears to tread|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126990.400-gravity-may-venture-where-matter-fears-to-tread.html|website=New Scientist|accessdate=4 August 2013|date=16 March 2009|issue=2699}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Extra massive hydrogen clouds''': The spectral lines of the [[Lyman-alpha forest]] suggest that hydrogen clouds are more clumped together at certain scales than expected and, like [[dark flow]], may indicate that gravity falls off ''slower'' than inverse-squared at certain distance scales.&lt;ref name=newsci2699/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3689">{{Taxation in the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}
'''İspençe''' was a tax levied on [[non-Muslim]]s in the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ACCOUNTING METHOD  USED BY OTTOMANS  FOR 500 YEARS: STAIRS (MERDIBAN) METHOD|pages=192|url=http://www.sgb.gov.tr/Publications/Accounting%20Method%20Used%20By%20Ottomans%20For%20500%20Years%20-%20Stairs%20(Merdiban)%20Method.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=morea&gt;{{cite book|title=A historical and economic geography of Ottoman Greece: the southwestern Morea in the 18th century|year=2005|publisher=ASCSA|isbn=978-0-87661-534-8|pages=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju9sKUox3OcC&amp;dq=ispence&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

İspençe was a land-tax on non-Muslims in parts of the Ottoman Empire; its counterpart, for Muslim taxpayers, was the resm-i çift - which was set at slightly lower rate.&lt;ref name=Malcolm&gt;{{cite book|last=Malcolm|first=Noel|title=Kosovo: A Short History|year=1999|publisher=Harper Perennial|isbn=978-0-06-097775-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treasury was well aware of the difference in tax takes, and the incentive to convert; the legal reforms of [[Bayezid II]] halved some criminal penalties on nonmuslim taxpayers "''so that the taxpayers shall not vanish''";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heyd|first=Uriel|title=Studies in old Ottoman criminal law|year=1973|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=156, 287}}&lt;/ref&gt; this rule was reconfimed, a century later, in 1587. In other cases, local taxes were imposed on nonmuslims specifically to encourage conversion.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

İspençe had existed in the Balkans before the Ottoman conquest; the Ottoman Empire typically adapted local taxes and institutions in each conquered area, leading to a patchwork of different taxes and rates. The concept of İspençe, theoretically a payment in lieu of [[corvee labour]], was derived from the Byzantine "zeugaratikion", a land tax based on the [[zeugarion]] - the area of farmland which could be ploughed by a pair of oxen. The zeugarion itself was taken up as the Ottoman "[[çift]]", a word meaning "pair".&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

==Variation==
Despite taxes being set centrally, by the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]], there was some local variance; around 1718. the [[kadı]] of Janjevo complained to Istanbul that the local lord set ispençe at 80 [[akçe]]s per year rather than official rate of 32.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

As with other [[Taxation in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman taxes]], there were various exemptions and loopholes; royal hunters, who provided birds-of-prey to the court, had an exemption from ispençe (and other taxes); they could pass on their job, and the tax exemption, to their sons.&lt;ref name=Acun&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acun|first=Fatma|title=The Other Side of the Coin: Tax Exemptions within the Context of Ottoman Taxation History|journal=Bulgarian Historical Review|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also some exemptions for those unable to work their land through disability, although it was expected that the elderly would have children able to work and therefore to pay ispençe.

The tax was paid by adult male heads of households; in the [[Morea]] it increased to 25 akces (from 20) between 1480 and 1512, and stayed at a similar level after that, (for most), confirmed by the tahrir of 1583; but widows may have paid a reduced rate, and Jews may have paid 125 akces.&lt;ref name=morea/&gt;

{{Buddhism}}
In Indian philosophy and [[Indian religions|religion]], '''jñāna''' (Sanskrit, pronounced gya:nə) ([[Pali]]: ''ñāṇa'') or '''gyan/gian''' ([[Hindi]]: ''jñān'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/gyan |title=Gyan – definition of ''gyan'' in English |website=[[Oxford Dictionaries]] |accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is "knowledge".

The idea of jnana centers on a cognitive event which is recognized when experienced. It is knowledge inseparable from the total experience of reality, especially a total or divine reality ([[Brahman]]).&lt;ref name="brittanica on jnana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/304133/jnana |title=jnana (Indian religion) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The root [[:wikt:ज्ञान|jñā-]] is cognate to  English ''[[:wikt:know|know]]'', as well as to the Greek [[:wikt:γιγνώσκω|γνώ-]] (as in γνῶσις ''[[gnosis]]'') and Russian ''[[:wikt:знание|знание]]''. Its antonym is ''ajñāna'' "ignorance".

==In Buddhism==
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], it refers to pure awareness that is free of conceptual encumbrances, and is contrasted with [[vijnana]], which is a moment of 'divided knowing'. Entrance to, and progression through the ten stages of Jnana/Bhimis, will lead one to complete enlightenment and [[nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;Gampopa's "Jewel Ornament of Liberation", especially the ten bhumis, where the absorption state or non-dual state, which characterizes all ten bhumis, in this well-respected traditional text, is equated to the state of jnana&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Vipassanā]] tradition of [[Buddhism]]  there are the following ñanas according to [[Mahasi Sayadaw]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Progress of Insight: (Visuddhiñana-katha), by The Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw, translated from the Pali with Notes by Nyanaponika Thera (1994; 33pp./99KB)&lt;/ref&gt;  As a person meditates these ñanas or "knowledges" will be experienced in order.  The experience of each may be brief or may last for years and the subjective intensity of each is variable. Each ñana could also be considered a [[jhāna]] although many are not stable and the mind has no way to remain embedded in the experience.  Experiencing all the ñanas will lead to the first of the [[Four stages of enlightenment]] then the cycle will start over at a subtler level.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==In Hinduism==

Sahu explains:
{{quote|''Prajnanam iti Brahman'' - wisdom is the soul/spirit. ''Prajnanam'' refers to the intuitive truth which can be verified/tested by reason. It is a higher function of the intellect that ascertains the ''Sat'' or Truth in the ''Sat-Chit-Ananda'' or truth-consciousness-bliss, i.e. the ''Brahman/Atman/Self''/person [...] A truly wise person [...] is known as ''[[Prajna (Vedic)|Prajna]]'' - who has attained ''Brahman''hood itself; thus, testifying to the ''Vedic'' ''Maha Vakya'' (great saying or words of wisdom): ''Prajnanam iti Brahman''.{{sfn|Sahu|2004|p=41}}}}

[[Jnana yoga]] (Yoga of Knowledge) is one of the three main paths ([[Sadhana|margas]]), which are supposed to lead towards [[moksha]] (liberation) from material miseries. The other two main paths  are [[Karma yoga]] and [[Bhakti Yoga]]. [[Rāja yoga]] (classical yoga) which includes several yogas, is also said to lead to moksha. It is said that each path is meant for a different temperament of personality.

== In Jainism ==
{{Main|Jain epistemology}}
According to the Jain texts like [[Tattvārthsūtra]] and [[Sarvārthasiddhi]], knowledge is of five kinds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details|title=Reality_JMT|last=Jain|first=S.A.|year=1992|publisher=Jwalamalini Trustp=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kevala Jnana]] (Omniscience)
* Śrutu Jñāna (Scriptural Knowledge)
* Mati Jñāna (Sensory Knowledge)
* Avadhi Jñāna (Clairvoyance)
* Manah prayāya Jñāna (Telepathy)

== In Sikhism ==
''Gyan'' or ''Gian'' refers to spiritual knowledge. It is mentioned throughout the [[Guru Granth Sahib]].

The ''join-based algorithms'' can be applied to at least four balancing schemes: [[AVL tree]]s, [[red-black tree]]s, [[weight-balanced tree]]s and [[treap]]s.

The ''join''&lt;math&gt;(L,k,R)&lt;/math&gt; operation takes as input two binary balanced trees &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of the same balancing scheme, and a key &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and outputs a new balanced binary tree &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; whose [[Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR)|in-order traversal]] is the in-order traversal of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; then the in-order traversal of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, if the trees are [[Search tree|search trees]], which means that the in-order of the trees maintain a [[total ordering]] on keys, it must satisfy the condition that all keys in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; are smaller than &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and all keys in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are greater than &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

==History==
The ''join'' operation was first defined by Tarjan &lt;ref name="join-tarjan"&gt;{{citation

In 1998, Blelloch and Reid-Miller extended ''join'' on [[treap]]s, and proved the bound of the set functions to be &lt;math&gt;O(m\log (1+\frac{n}{m}))&lt;/math&gt; for two trees of size &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n(\ge m)&lt;/math&gt;, which is optimal in the comparison model. They also brought up parallelism in Adams' algorithm by using a [[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide-and-conquer scheme]]. In 2016, Blelloch et al. formally proposed the join-based algorithms, and formalized the ''join'' algorithm for four different balancing schemes: [[AVL tree]]s, [[red-black tree]]s, [[weight-balanced tree]]s and [[treap]]s. In the same work they proved that Adams' algorithms on union, intersection and difference are work-optimal on all the four balancing schemes.

==Join Algorithms==
The function ''join''&lt;math&gt;(t_1,k,t_2)&lt;/math&gt; considers rebalancing the tree, and thus depends on the input balancing scheme. If the two trees are balanced, ''join'' simply creates a new node with left subtree {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, root {{mvar|k}} and right subtree {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Suppose that {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is heavier (this "heavier" depends on the balancing scheme) than {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} (the other case is symmetric). ''Join'' follows the right spine of {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} until a node {{mvar|c}} which is balanced with {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. At this point a new node with left child {{mvar|c}}, root {{mvar| k}} and right child {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is created to replace c. The new node may invalidate the balancing invariant. This can be fixed with rotations.

The following is the ''join'' algorithms on different balancing schemes.

The [[AVL tree#Set operations and bulk operations|''join'' algorithm for AVL trees]]:

 '''function''' joinRightAVL(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     (l, k', c) = expose(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' (h(c) &lt; h(T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) + 1)
        T'=Node(c, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
        if (h(T') &lt;= h(l) + 1) then '''return''' Node(l, k', T')
        else '''return''' rotateLeft(Node(l, k', rotateRight(T')))
     '''else''' 
         T' = joinRightAVL(c, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
         T'' = Node(l, k', T')
         '''if''' (h(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; h(T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) + 1) '''return''' T''
         '''else''' '''return''' rotateLeft(T'')
 '''function''' joinLeftAVL(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
   /* symmetric to joinRightAVL */
 '''function''' join(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' (h(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; h(T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) + 1) '''return''' joinRightAVL(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' (h(T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; h(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) + 1) '''return''' joinLeftAVL(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''return''' Node(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)

Here &lt;math&gt;h(v)&lt;/math&gt; of a node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; the height of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. expose(v)=(l,k,r) means to extract a tree node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;'s left child &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, the key of the node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and the right child &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Node(l,k,r) means to create a node of left child &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, key &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and right child &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Red-black tree#Set operations and bulk operations|''join'' algorithm for red-black trees]]:

 '''function''' joinRightRB(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' r(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) = ⌊r(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/2⌋ × 2:
         '''return''' Node(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, ⟨k, red⟩, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''else''' 
         (L', ⟨k', c'⟩, R') = expose(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)
         T' = Node(L', ⟨k', c'⟩, joinRightRB(R', k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
         '''if''' (c' = black) and (T'.right.color = T'.right.right.color = red):
              T'.right.right.color = black
              '''return''' rotateLeft(T')
         '''else''' return T'
 '''function''' joinLeftRB(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
   /* symmetric to joinRightRB */
 '''function''' join(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' ⌊r(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/2⌋ &gt; ⌊r(T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)/2⌋ × 2:
        T' = joinRightRB(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
        '''if''' (T'.color = red) and (T'.right.color = red):
           T'.color = black
        return T'
     '''else if''' ⌊r(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/2⌋ &gt; ⌊r(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/2⌋ × 2
        /* symmetric */
     '''else if''' (T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.color = black) and (T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = black)
        Node(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, ⟨k, red⟩, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''else'''
        Node(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, ⟨k, black⟩, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)

Here &lt;math&gt;r(v)&lt;/math&gt; of a node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; means twice the black height of a black node, and the twice the black height of a red node. expose(v)=(l,⟨k,c⟩,r) means to extract a tree node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;'s left child &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, the key of the node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the color of the node &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and the right child &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Node(l,⟨k,c⟩,r) means to create a node of left child &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, key &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, color &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and right child &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Weight-balanced tree#Set operations and bulk operations|''join'' algorithm for weight-balanced trees]]:

 '''function''' joinRightWB(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
    (l, k', c)=expose(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' balance(|T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;|, |T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;|) '''return''' Node(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;,k,T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''else''' 
         T' = joinRightWB(c, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
         (l&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = expose(T')
         '''if''' (balance(l, T')) '''return''' Node(l, k', T')
         '''else if''' (balance(|l|, |l&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|) and balance(|l|+|l&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|, |r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|))
              '''return''' rotateLeft(Node(l, k', T'))
         '''else''' return rotateLeft(Node(l, k', rotateRight(T'))
 '''function''' joinLeftWB(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
   /* symmetric to joinRightWB */
 '''function''' join(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' (heavy(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)) return joinRightWB(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' (heavy(T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)) return joinLeftWB(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     Node(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)

Here balance&lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; means two weigthts &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are balanced. expose(v)=(l,k,r) means to extract a tree node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;'s left child &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, the key of the node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and the right child &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Node(l,k,r) means to create a node of left child &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, key &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and right child &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

==Join-based Algorithms==
In the following, expose(v)=(l,k,r) means to extract a tree node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;'s left child &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, the key of the node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and the right child &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Node(l,k,r) means to create a node of left child &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, key &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and right child &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. right(&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;) and left(&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;) extracts the right child and the left child of a tree node&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. &lt;math&gt;k(v)&lt;/math&gt; extract the key of a node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. "&lt;math&gt;s_1 || s_2&lt;/math&gt;" means that two statements &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; can run in parallel.

===Split===
To split a tree into two trees, those smaller than key ''x'', and those larger than key ''x'', we first draw a path from the root by inserting ''x'' into the tree. After this insertion, all values less than ''x'' will be found on the left of the path, and all values greater than ''x'' will be found on the right. By applying ''Join'', all the subtrees on the left side are merged bottom-up using keys on the path as intermediate nodes from bottom to top to form the left tree, and the right part is asymmetric. For some applications, ''Split'' also returns a boolean value denoting if ''x'' appears in the tree. The cost of ''Split'' is &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt;, order of the height of the tree. 

The split algorithm is as follows:

 '''function''' split(T,k)
     '''if''' (T=nil) return (nil,false,nil)
     (L,(m,c),R)=expose(T)
     '''if''' (k=m) return (L,true,R)
     '''if''' (k&lt;m) 
        (L',b,R')=split(L,k)
        '''return''' (L',b,join(R',m,R))
     '''if''' (k&gt;m) 
        (L',b,R')=split(R,k)
        '''return''' (join(L,m,L'),b,R))

===Join2===
This function is defined similarly as ''join'' but without the middle key. It first splits out the last key &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of the left tree, and then join the rest part of the left tree with the right tree with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
The algorithm is as follows:

 '''function''' splitLast(T)
    (L,k,R)=expose(T)
     '''if''' (R=nil) '''return''' (L,k)
     (T',k')=splitLast(R)
     '''return''' (join(L,k,T'),k')
 '''function''' join2(L,R)
     '''if''' (L=nil) '''return''' R
     (L',k)=splitLast(L)
     '''return''' join(L',k,R)

The cost is &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; for a tree of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

===Insert and Delete===
The insertion and deletion algorithms, when making use of ''join'' can be independent of balancing schemes. For an insertion, the algorithm compares the key to be inserted with the key in the root, inserts it to the left/right subtree if the key is smaller/greater than the key in the root, and joins the two subtrees back with the root. A deletion compares the key to be deleted with the key in the root. If they are equal, return join2 on the two subtrees. Otherwise, delete the key from the corresponding subtree, and join the two subtrees back with the root.
The algorithms are as follows:

 '''function''' insert(T,k)
    if (T=nil) '''return''' Node(nil,k,nil)
    (L,k',R)=expose(T)
     '''if''' (k&lt;k') '''return''' join(insert(L,k),k',R)
     '''if''' (k&gt;k') '''return''' join(L,k,insert(R,k))
 '''function''' delete(T,k)
    if (T=nil) '''return''' nil
    (L,k',R)=expose(T)
     '''if''' (k&lt;k') '''return''' join(delete(L,k),k',R)
     '''if''' (k&gt;k') '''return''' join(L,k',delete(R,k))
     return join2(L,R)

Both insertion and deletion requires &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; time if &lt;math&gt;|T|=n&lt;/math&gt;.

===Set-Set Functions===
Several set operations have been defined on weight-balanced trees: [[Union (set theory)|union]], [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[set difference]]. The union of two weight-balanced trees {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} representing sets {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}}, is a tree {{mvar|''t''}} that represents {{math|''A'' ∪ ''B''}}. The following recursive function computes this union:

 '''function''' union(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):
     '''if''' t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = nil:
         '''return''' t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
     '''if''' t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = nil:
         '''return''' t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
     (t&lt;sub&gt;&lt;&lt;/sub&gt;, b, t&lt;sub&gt;&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) = split t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.root
     nl=union(left(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), t&lt;sub&gt;&lt;&lt;/sub&gt;) || nr = union(right(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), t&lt;sub&gt;&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''return''' join(nl, t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.root, nr)

Similarly, the algorithms of intersection and set-difference are as follows:

 '''function''' intersection(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):
     '''if''' (t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = nil or t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = nil) '''return''' nil
     (t&lt;sub&gt;&lt;&lt;/sub&gt;, b, t&lt;sub&gt;&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) = split t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.root
     nl = t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.root, intersection(left(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) || nr = intersection(right(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), t&lt;sub&gt;&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if'''  (b) '''return''' join(nl, t&lt;sub&gt;&lt;&lt;/sub&gt;), nr)
     '''else''' '''return''' join2(nl, nr)
 '''function''' difference(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):
     '''if''' (t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = nil) '''return''' nil
     '''if''' (t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = nil) '''return''' t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
     (t&lt;sub&gt;&lt;&lt;/sub&gt;, b, t&lt;sub&gt;&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) = split t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.root
     nl = difference(left(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), t&lt;sub&gt;&lt;&lt;/sub&gt;) || nr = difference(right(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), t&lt;sub&gt;&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''return''' join2(nl, nr)

The complexity of each of union, intersection and difference is &lt;math&gt;O\left(m \log \left({n\over m}+1\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt; for two weight-balanced trees of sizes &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n(\ge m)&lt;/math&gt;. This complexity is optimal in terms of the number of comparisons. More importantly, since the recursive calls to union, intersection or difference are independent of each other, they can be executed [[parallel programming|in parallel]] with a [[Analysis of parallel algorithms|parallel depth]] &lt;math&gt;O(\log m\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="join-based"/&gt; When &lt;math&gt;m=1&lt;/math&gt;, the join-based implementation applies the same computation as in a single-element insertion or deletion if the root of the larger tree is used to split the smaller tree.

===Build===
The algorithm for building a tree can make use of the union algorithm, and use the divide-and-conquer scheme:

 '''function''' build(A[], n):
     '''if''' (n=0) '''return''' nil
     '''if''' (n=1) '''return''' Node(nil,A[0],nil)
     L = build(A,n/2) || R = (A+n/2, n-n/2)
     '''return''' union(L,R)

This algorithm costs &lt;math&gt;O(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt; work and has &lt;math&gt;O(\log^3 n)&lt;/math&gt; depth. A more-efficient algorithm makes use of a parallel sorting algorithm.

 '''function''' buildSorted(A[], n):
     '''if''' (n=0) '''return''' nil
     '''if''' (n=1) '''return''' Node(nil,A[0],nil)
     L = build(A,n/2) || R = (A+n/2+1, n-n/2-1)
     '''return''' join(L,A[n/2],R)
 '''function''' build(A[], n):
     A'=sort(A,n)
     '''return''' buildSorted(A,n)

This algorithm costs &lt;math&gt;O(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt; work and has &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; depth assuming the sorting algorithm has &lt;math&gt;O(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt; work and &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; depth.

===Filter===
This function selects all entries in a tree satisfying an indicator &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, and return a tree containing all selected entries. It recursively filters the two subtrees, and join them with the root if the root satisfies &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise ''join2'' the two subtrees.

 '''function''' filter(T,f):
     '''if''' (T=nil) '''return''' nil
     L = filter(left(T),f) || R = (right(T),f)
     '''if''' (f(k(T)) '''return''' join(L,k(T),R)
     '''else''' '''return''' join2(L,R)

This algorithm costs work &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; and depth &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; on a tree of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, assuming &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has constant cost.

'''KHOPCA''' is an adaptive [[clustering algorithm]] originally developed for dynamic networks. KHOPCA (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-hop clustering algorithm) provides a fully [[Distributed computing|distributed]] and localized approach to group elements such as nodes in a network according to their distance from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brust|first=Matthias R.|last2=Frey|first2=Hannes|last3=Rothkugel|first3=Steffen|date=2007-01-01|title=Adaptive Multi-hop Clustering in Mobile Networks|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1378063.1378086|journal=Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications, and Systems and the 1st International Symposium on Computer Human Interaction in Mobile Technology|series=Mobility '07|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=132–138|doi=10.1145/1378063.1378086|isbn=9781595938190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brust|first=Matthias R.|last2=Frey|first2=Hannes|last3=Rothkugel|first3=Steffen|date=2008-01-01|title=Dynamic Multi-hop Clustering for Mobile Hybrid Wireless Networks|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1352793.1352820|journal=Proceedings of the 2Nd International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication|series=ICUIMC '08|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=130–135|doi=10.1145/1352793.1352820|isbn=9781595939937}}&lt;/ref&gt; KHOPCA  operates proactively through a simple set of rules that defines clusters, which are optimal with respect to the applied distance function.

KHOPCA's clustering process explicitly supports joining and leaving of nodes, which makes KHOPCA suitable for highly dynamic networks. However, it has been demonstrated that KHOPCA also performs in static networks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Besides applications in ad hoc and [[wireless sensor network]]s, KHOPCA can be used in localization and navigation problems, networked [[Swarm intelligence|swarming]], and real-time [[Cluster analysis|data clustering and analysis]].

== Algorithm description ==
KHOPCA (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-hop clustering algorithm) operates proactively through a simple set of rules that defines clusters with variable &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-hops. A set of local rules describes the state transition between nodes. A node's weight is determined only depending on the current state of its neighbors in communication range. Each node of the network is continuously involved in this process. As result, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-hop clusters are formed and maintained in static as well as dynamic networks.

KHOPCA does not require any predetermined initial configuration. Therefore, a node can potentially choose any weight (between &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MIN&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MAX&lt;/math&gt;). However, the choice of the initial configuration does influence the convergence time.

=== Initialization ===
The prerequisites in the start configuration for the application of the rules are the following.
* &lt;math&gt;\Nu&lt;/math&gt; is the network with nodes and links, whereby each node has a weight &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.
* Each node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Nu&lt;/math&gt; node stores the same positive values &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MIN&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MAX&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MIN &lt; MAX&lt;/math&gt;.
* A node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; with weight &lt;math display="inline"&gt;w_n=MAX&lt;/math&gt; is called cluster center.
* &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MAX&lt;/math&gt; - &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MIN&lt;/math&gt; and represents the maximum size a cluster can have from the most outer node to the cluster center. The cluster diameter is therefore &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k\cdot2-1&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\Nu(n)&lt;/math&gt; returns the direct neighbors of node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W(\Nu)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of weights of all nodes of &lt;math&gt;\Nu&lt;/math&gt;.
The following rules describe the state transition for a node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; with weight &lt;math display="inline"&gt;w_n&lt;/math&gt;. These rules have to be executed on each node in the order described here.

=== Rule 1 ===
[[File:KHOPCA rule 1.png|thumb|KHOPCA rule 1]]
The first rule has the function of constructing an order within the cluster. This happens through a node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; detects the direct neighbor with the highest weight &lt;math display="inline"&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, which is higher than the node's own weight &lt;math display="inline"&gt;w_n&lt;/math&gt;. If such a direct neighbor is detected, the node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; changes its own weight to be the weight of the highest weight within the neighborhood subtracted by 1. Applied iteratively, this process creates a top-to-down hierarchical cluster structure.&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="java" line="1"&gt;
if max(W(N(n))) &gt; w_n
    w_n = max(W(N(n))) - 1
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Rule 2 ===
[[File:KHOPCA rule 2 a.png|thumb|KHOPCA rule 2]]
The second rule deals with the situation where nodes in a neighborhood are on the minimum weight level. This situation can happen if, for instance, the initial configuration assigns the minimum weight to all nodes. If there is a neighborhood with all nodes having the minimum weight level, the node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; declares itself as cluster center. Even if coincidently all nodes declare themselves as cluster centers, the conflict situation will be resolved by one of the other rules.&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="java" line="1"&gt;
if max(W(N(n)) == MIN &amp; w_n == MIN
    w_n = MAX;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Rule 3 ===
[[File:KHOPCA rule 3 a.png|thumb|KHOPCA rule 3]]
The third rule describes situations where nodes with leveraged weight values, which are not cluster centers, attract surrounding nodes with lower weights. This behavior can lead to fragmented clusters without a cluster center. In order to avoid fragmented clusters, the node with higher weight value is supposed to successively decrease its own weight with the objective to correct the fragmentation by allowing the other nodes to reconfigure according to the rules. &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="java" line="1"&gt;
if max(W(N(n))) &lt;= w_n &amp;&amp; w_n != MAX
    w_n = w_n - 1;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Rule 4 ===
[[File:KHOPCA rule 4 a.png|thumb|KHOPCA rule 4]]
The fourth rule resolves the situation where two cluster centers connect in 1-hop neighborhood and need to decide which cluster center should continue its role as cluster center. Given any specific criterion (e.g., device ID, battery power), one cluster center remains while the other cluster center is hierarchized in 1-hop neighborhood to that new cluster center. The choice of the specific criterion to resolve the decision-making depends on the used application scenario and on the available information. &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="java" line="1"&gt;
if max(W(N(n)) == MAX &amp;&amp; w_n == MAX
    w_n = apply criterion to select a node from set (max(W(N(n)),w_n);
    w_n = w_n - 1;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Examples ==

=== 1-D ===
An exemplary sequence of state transitions applying the described four rules is illustrated below.

=== 2-D ===

=== 3-D ===
KHOPCA also works in a dynamic 3-D environment. The cluster connections are illustrated with bold lines.

== Guarantees ==
It has been demonstrated that KHOPCA terminates after a finite number of state transitions in static networks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Language Rights Support Program''' (LRSP) is a non-profit organisation whose objectives are "to promote awareness of [[language rights]] through public education; to offer access to alternative dispute resolution processes to settle disputes out of court; to support litigation that helps to advance and clarify constitutional language rights when test cases are involved and dispute resolution efforts have not resolved matters." &lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Website ''[http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/lo-ol/pgm/pubs/padl-lrsp/101-eng.cfm Language Rights Support Program]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the abolition of the [[Court Challenges Program of Canada]] in 2006, the Language Rights Support Program was created in 2008, receiving an annual budget of $1.5 million from the Government of Canada.

The LRSP works to promote constitutional language rights in Canada and offers financial aid to individuals, groups and non-profit organizations who belong to [[official bilingualism in Canada|official language]] communities in Canada and who feel their constitutional language rights have been breached.

Financial aid can be awarded for [[alternative dispute resolution]] such as mediation, negotiation and arbitration or it can be awarded for litigation. To receive financial aid, applicants must fulfill the criteria set forth by the LRSP, most importantly having a case that involves constitutional language rights.

'''London Sake Challenge (LSC)''', established in 2012 by the [[Sake sommelier association|Sake Sommelier Association]] and its founders Xavier Chapelou and Kumiko Ohta, is an annual [[sake]] competition held at [[Harrods]], and is the first competition of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 2012 London Sake Challenge|url=http://jytk.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/the-2012-london-sake-challenge/|newspaper=Roadside Hut of the Jui "Young"|date=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products submitted from [[breweries]] all over [[Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sommeliers Match Sake with Truffles and Foie Gras|url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/m/2012/09/sommeliers-match-sake-with-foie-gras|newspaper=Wine-searcher|date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are evaluated by sake sommeliers from around the world and judged by taste, quality, labelling and packaging. The first competition took place on 20 August 2012, during [[London 2012|2012 London Olympic Games]].

== Objective ==
The purpose of the event is to recognise outstanding premium sakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sam|title=London Sake Challenge|url=http://www.esdmagazine.com/london-sake-challenge/|newspaper=Eat Sleep Drink Magazine|date=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to promote the consumption of sake by highlighting a new market where sake is matched with non-[[oriental]] food. It also seeks to increase public awareness and fashionability of the drink in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Joe|first=Warwick|title=Sake Sommelier Association launches London Sake Challenge|url=http://www.harpers.co.uk/sommelier/sommeliers-news/12324-sake-sommelier-association-launches-london-sake-challenge.html|newspaper=Harpers|date=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Melinda|first=Joe|title=Looking to bring Japan’s tastes to new markets through sake|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/01/23/national/looking-to-bring-japans-tastes-to-new-markets-through-sake/#.UUHnDXNgqTw|newspaper=The Japan Times|date=23 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judging Process ==
Every sake is assessed independently, not comparatively. Sake sommeliers and jury members evaluate each sake by scoring appearance, flavour and taste in the first round of blind tasting. Labelling and packaging are assessed separately in the second round. Sake sommeliers score sakes from 0 to 5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Sake Challenge|url=http://londonsakechallenge.com/judge-en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reward ==
The competition awards gold, silver and bronze medals to the highest scoring sakes in accordance with the judging criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Experts in U.K. push rice wine in Europe|url=http://aws.japantimes.co.jp/news/2012/08/29/news/experts-in-u-k-push-rice-wine-in-europe/#.UQfu1nNgqTw|newspaper=The Japan Times|date=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Loneliness''' is a complex and usually unpleasant [[emotion]]al response to [[Social isolation|isolation]]. Loneliness typically includes anxious feelings about a lack of [[Interpersonal relationship|connection]] or [[communication]] with other beings, both in the present and extending into the future. As such, loneliness can be felt even when surrounded by other people. The causes of loneliness are varied and include social, mental, emotional, and physical factors.

Research has shown that loneliness is prevalent throughout society, including people in marriages, relationships, families, veterans, and those with successful careers.&lt;ref name="Peplau, L.A. 1982 pp. 1-18"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peplau |first1=L.A. |last2=Perlman |first2=D. |year=1982 |chapter=Perspectives on loneliness |editor1-first=Letitia Anne |editor1-last=Peplau |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Perlman |title=Loneliness: A sourcebook of current theory, research and therapy |pages=1–18 |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-08028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been a long explored theme in the literature of human beings since classical antiquity. Loneliness has also been described as [[social pain]]—a psychological mechanism meant to motivate an individual to seek social connections.&lt;ref name="Science of Loneliness.com"&gt;Cacioppo, John; [[William Patrick, author|Patrick, William]], ''Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection'', New York : W.W.

==Common causes==
People can experience loneliness for many reasons, and many life events may cause it, such as a lack of [[friendship]] relations during [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]], or the physical absence of meaningful people around a person. At the same time, loneliness may be a symptom of another [[social]] or [[Psychology|psychological]] problem, such as [[Dysthymia|chronic depression]].

Many people experience loneliness for the first time when they are left alone as [[infants]]. It is also a very common, though normally temporary, consequence of a [[Relationship breakup|breakup]], [[divorce]], or loss of any important [[long-term relationship]]. In these cases, it may stem both from the loss of a specific person and from the withdrawal from [[social circle]]s caused by the event or the associated sadness.

The loss of a significant person in one's life will typically initiate a [[grief|grief response]]; in this situation, one might feel lonely, even while in the company of others. Loneliness may also occur after the birth of a [[child]] (often expressed in [[postpartum depression]]), after [[marriage]], or following any other socially disruptive event, such as moving from one's home town into an unfamiliar [[community]], leading to [[homesickness]]. Loneliness can occur within unstable [[marriages]] or other close [[interpersonal relationship|relationships]] of a similar nature, in which feelings present may include [[anger]] or [[resentment]], or in which the feeling of [[love]] cannot be given or received. Loneliness may represent a dysfunction of [[Interpersonal communication|communication]], and can also result from places with low [[Population density|population densities]] in which there are comparatively few people to interact with. Loneliness can also be seen as a [[social phenomenon]], capable of spreading like a disease. When one person in a group begins to feel lonely, this feeling can spread to others, increasing everybody's risk for feelings of loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Parker |first=Pope |url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/why-loneliness-can-be-contagious/ |title=Why loneliness can be contagious |accessdate=10 December 2012 |work=The New York Times |date=1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can feel lonely even when they are surrounded by other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1943748,00.html#ixzz0YZghiRRl |title=Feeling Alone Together: How Loneliness Spreads |publisher=Time.com |date=1 December 2009 |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[twin study]] found evidence that [[genetics]] account for approximately half of the measurable differences in loneliness among adults, which was similar to the heritability estimates found previously in children. These genes operate in a similar manner in males and females. The study found no common environmental contributions to adult loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10519-005-6040-8 |title=Genetic and Environmental Contributions to Loneliness in Adults: The Netherlands Twin Register Study |year=2005 |last1=Boomsma |first1=Dorret I. |last2=Willemsen |first2=Gonneke |last3=Dolan |first3=Conor V. |last4=Hawkley |first4=Louise C. |last5=Cacioppo |first5=John T. |journal=Behavior Genetics |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=745–52 |pmid=16273322|citeseerx=10.1.1.453.498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==

===Feeling lonely vs. being socially isolated===
There is a clear distinction between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a [[loner]]). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]],&lt;ref name="Peplau, L.A. 1982 pp. 1-18"/&gt; while [[solitude]] is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or in the middle of a crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own optimal level of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or [[over-stimulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Suedfeld |first1=P. |year=1989 |chapter=Past the reflection and through the looking-glass: Extending loneliness research |editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Hojat |editor2-first=R. |editor2-last=Crandall |title=Loneliness: Theory, research and applications |pages=51–6 |location=Newbury Park, California |publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solitude can have positive effects on individuals. One [[Research|study]] found that, although time spent alone tended to depress a person's mood and increase feelings of loneliness, it also helped to improve their [[Cognition|cognitive state]], such as improving [[Attention|concentration]]. Furthermore, once the alone time was over, people's moods tended to increase significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Larson |first1=R. |last2=Csikszentmihalyi |first2=M. |last3=Graef |first3=R. |year=1982 |chapter=Time alone in daily experience: Loneliness or renewal? |editor1-first=Letitia Anne |editor1-last=Peplau |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Perlman |title=Loneliness: A sourcebook of current theory, research and therapy |pages=41–53 |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-08028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solitude is also associated with other positive growth experiences, [[Religion|religious]] experiences, and [[Identity (social science)|identity]] building such as solitary quests used in [[rites of passage]]s for adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Suedfeld |first1=P. |year=1982 |chapter=Aloneness as a healing experience |editor1-first=Letitia Anne |editor1-last=Peplau |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Perlman |title=Loneliness: A sourcebook of current theory, research and therapy |pages=54–67 |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-08028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loneliness can also play an important role in the [[creativity|creative]] process. In some people, temporary or prolonged loneliness can lead to notable [[art]]istic and creative expression, for example, as was the case with [[poet]]s [[Emily Dickinson]] and [[Isabella di Morra]], and numerous [[musician]]s{{Who|date=May 2017}}. This is not to imply that loneliness itself ensures this creativity, rather, it may have an influence on the subject matter of the artist and more likely be present in individuals engaged in creative activities.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Transient vs. chronic loneliness===
The other important typology of loneliness focuses on the [[time]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=de Jong-Gierveld |first1=J. |last2=Raadschelders |first2=J. |year=1982 |chapter=Types of loneliness |editor1-first=Letitia Anne |editor1-last=Peplau |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Perlman |title=Loneliness: A sourcebook of current theory, research and therapy |pages=105–19 |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-08028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, loneliness can be viewed as either [[wikt:transient|transient]] or [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]]. It has also been referred to as state and trait loneliness.

Transient (state) loneliness is temporary in nature, caused by something in the environment, and is easily relieved. Chronic (trait) loneliness is more permanent, caused by the person, and is not easily relieved.&lt;ref&gt;Duck, S. (1992). Human relations (2nd ed.).  London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when a person is sick and cannot socialize with friends would be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got better it would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness. A person who feels lonely regardless of if they are at a family gathering, with friends, or alone is experiencing chronic loneliness. It does not matter what goes on in the surrounding environment, the experience of loneliness is always there.

===Loneliness as a human condition===
The [[existentialist]] school of thought views loneliness as the essence of being [[human]]. Each human being comes into the world alone, travels through life as a separate person, and ultimately dies alone. Coping with this, accepting it, and learning how to direct our own lives with some degree of grace and satisfaction is the [[human condition]].&lt;ref name="Exist"&gt;''[http://www.philosophicalsociety.com/Archives/An%20Existential%20View%20Of%20Loneliness.htm An Existential View of Loneliness]'' - Carter, Michele; excerpt from ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20111007024245/http://www.parkridgecenter.org/Page437.html Abiding Loneliness: An Existential Perspective]'', Park Ridge Center, September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[philosopher]]s, such as [[Sartre]], believe in an epistemic loneliness in which loneliness is a fundamental part of the human condition because of the paradox between people's consciousness desiring [[Meaning of life|meaning in life]] and the isolation and nothingness of the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tomšik |first1=Robert |title=Relationship of loneliness and meaning of life among adolescents. In Current Trends in Educational Science and Practice VIII : International Proceedings of Scientific Studies |date=2015 |publisher=UKF |location=Nitra |isbn=978-80-558-0813-0 |pages=66-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, other existentialist thinkers argue that human beings might be said to actively engage each other and the universe as they communicate and create, and loneliness is merely the feeling of being cut off from this process.

==Frequency==
There are several estimates and indicators of loneliness. It has been estimated that approximately 60 million people in the [[United States]], or 20% of the total population, feel lonely.&lt;ref name="Science of Loneliness.com"/&gt; Another study found that 12% of Americans have no one with whom to spend free time or to discuss important matters.&lt;ref&gt;Christakis, N. A. &amp; Fowler, J. H. (2009). Connected: The surprising power of our social networks and how they shape our lives. New York, NY: Little, Brown and Company.{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research suggests that this rate has been increasing over time. The ''General Social Survey'' found that between 1985 and 2004, the number of people the average American discusses important matters with decreased from three to two. Additionally, the number of Americans with no one to discuss important matters with tripled&lt;ref&gt;Olds, J. &amp; Schwartz, R. S. (2009). ''The lonely American: Drifting apart in the 21st century''. Boston, MA: Beacon Press{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though this particular study may be flawed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://asr.sagepub.com/content/74/4/657.abstract|title=The 2004 GSS Finding of Shrunken Social Networks: An Artifact?|volume=74|issue=4|pages=657–669|work=sagepub.com|doi=10.1177/000312240907400408|year=2009|last1=Fischer|first1=Claude S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  In the UK research by [[Age UK]] shows half a million people more than 60 years old spend each day alone without social interaction and almost half a million more see and speak to no one for 5 or 6 days a week.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/06/half-a-million-older-people-spend-every-day-alone-poll-shows  Half a million older people spend every day alone, poll shows] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the ''Community Life Survey, 2016 to 2017'', by the UK's [[Office for National Statistics]], found that young adults in [[England]] aged 16 to 24 reported feeling lonely more often than those in older age groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/lonelinesswhatcharacteristicsandcircumstancesareassociatedwithfeelinglonely/2018-04-10 Loneliness - What characteristics and circumstances are associated with feeling lonely?] Analysis of characteristics and circumstances associated with loneliness in England using the Community Life Survey, 2016 to 2017.

Loneliness appears to have intensified in every society in the world as modernization occurs. A certain amount of this loneliness appears to be related to greater migration, smaller household sizes, a larger degree of [[media consumption]] (all of which have positive sides as well in the form of more opportunities, more choice in family size, and better access to information), all of which relates to [[social capital]].

Within [[Developed country|developed nations]], loneliness has shown the largest increases among two groups: seniors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Aging/5-11-21-SeniorsAreLonely.htm |title=Most Senior Citizens Experience Loneliness, Say Researchers |accessdate=2012-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226045830/http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Aging/5-11-21-SeniorsAreLonely.htm |archivedate=26 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isolatedseniors.ca/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815113613/http://isolatedseniors.ca/ |archivedate=15 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and people living in low-density suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/49370|title=Isolation and Dissatisfaction in the Suburbs|work=Planetizen:  The Urban Planning, Design, and Development Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geog.ubc.ca/~ewyly/u200/suburbia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Seniors living in suburban areas are particularly vulnerable, for as they lose the ability to drive, they often become "stranded" and find it difficult to maintain [[interpersonal relationship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governing.com/topics/transportation-infrastructure/Stranded-Seniors.html|title=Stranded Seniors|work=governing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loneliness is prevalent in vulnerable groups in society.  In New Zealand the fourteen surveyed groups with the highest prevalence of loneliness most/all of the time in descending order are: disabled, recent migrants, low income households, unemployed, single parents, rural (rest of South Island), seniors aged 75+, not in the labour force, youth aged 15-24, no qualifications, not housing owner-occupier, not in a family nucleus, Māori, and low personal income.&lt;ref name="Loneliness NZ"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Comber |first1=Cathy |title=Ms |url=https://www.loneliness.org.nz/nz/facts/loneliness-prevalent-in-the-vulnerable/ |website=www.loneliness.org.nz |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans seem to report more loneliness than any other country, though this finding may simply be an effect of greater research volume. A 2006 study in the ''[[American Sociological Review]]'' found that Americans on average had only two close friends in which to confide, which was down from an average of three in 1985. The percentage of people who noted having no such [[confidant]] rose from 10% to almost 25%, and an additional 19% said they had only a single confidant, often their [[spouse]], thus raising the risk of serious loneliness if the relationship ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/000312240607100301 |title=Social Isolation in America: Changes in Core Discussion Networks over Two Decades |year=2006 |last1=McPherson |first1=M. |last2=Smith-Lovin |first2=L. |last3=Brashears |first3=M. E. |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=353–75|citeseerx=10.1.1.101.6700 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern office environment has been demonstrated to give rise to loneliness. This can be especially prevalent in individuals prone to social isolation who can interpret the business focus of co-workers for a deliberate ignoring of needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Sarah|title=Loneliness in the Workplace|date=16 May 2008|publisher=VDM Verlag Dr. Mull Ed Beasleyschaft &amp; Co.|isbn=978-3-639-02734-1}}{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] exists between [[Internet]] usage and loneliness is a subject of controversy, with some findings showing that Internet users are lonelier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Carole |last=Hughes |year=1999 |title=The relationship of use of the Internet and loneliness among college students |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=Boston College |oclc=313894784}}{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others showing that lonely people who use the Internet to keep in touch with loved ones (especially seniors) report less loneliness, but that those trying to make friends online became lonelier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/cpb.2007.0010 |title=Internet Use and Loneliness in Older Adults |year=2008 |last1=Sum |first1=Shima |last2=Mathews |first2=R.

==Effects==

===Mental health===
[[File:Thoma Loneliness.jpg|thumb|''Loneliness'' by [[Hans Thoma]] ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]])]]

Loneliness has been linked with [[depression (mood)|depression]], and is thus a risk factor for [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="PsychTo"&gt;''[https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/articles/200307/the-dangers-loneliness The Dangers of Loneliness]'' - Marano, Hara Estroff; ''[[Psychology Today]]'' Thursday 21 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim]] has described loneliness, specifically the inability or unwillingness to live for others, i.e. for friendships or altruistic ideas, as the main reason for what he called ''egoistic suicide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Polina |last=Shelkova |year=2010 |title=Loneliness |url=http://www.vzmakh.ru/refero/english/2009-2010/loneless.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2013}} In adults, loneliness is a major precipitant of depression and [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marano |first=Hara |title=The Dangers of Loneliness |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200308/the-dangers-loneliness |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who are socially isolated may report poor [[sleep]] quality, and thus have diminished restorative processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0889-1591(02)00073-9 |title=Loneliness and pathways to disease |year=2003 |last1=Hawkley |first1=Louise C |last2=Cacioppo |first2=John T |journal=Brain, Behavior, and Immunity |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=98–105 |pmid=12615193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loneliness has also been linked with a [[Schizoid personality disorder|schizoid character type]] in which one may see the world differently and experience [[social alienation]], described as ''the self in exile''.&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;{{cite book |title=Disorders of the Self: Secret Pure Schizoid Cluster Disorder |year=1995 |pages=25–7 |last1=Masterson |first1=James F. |last2=Klein |first2=Ralph |quote=Klein was Clinical Director of the Masterson Institute and Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York |authorlink1=James F. Masterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[children]], a lack of social connections is directly linked to several forms of [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] and [[self-destructive]] behavior, most notably [[Hostility|hostile]] and [[juvenile delinquency|delinquent]] behavior. In both children and adults, loneliness often has a negative impact on [[learning]] and [[memory]]. Its disruption of [[sleep]] patterns can have a significant impact on the ability to function in everyday life.&lt;ref name="PsychTo"/&gt;

Research from a large-scale study published in the journal [[Psychological Medicine]], showed that "lonely [[millennial]]s are more likely to have mental health problems, be out of work and feel pessimistic about their ability to succeed in life than their peers who feel connected to others, regardless of gender or wealth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/24/loneliness-linked-to-major-life-setbacks-for-millennials-study-says Loneliness linked to major life setbacks for millennials, study says].

Pain, depression, and fatigue function as a symptom cluster and thus may share common risk factors. Two longitudinal studies with different populations demonstrated that loneliness was a risk factor for the development of the pain, depression, and fatigue symptom cluster over time.  These data also highlight the health risks of loneliness; pain, depression, and fatigue often accompany serious illness and place people at risk for poor health and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Jaremka, L.M., Andridge, R.R., Fagundes, C.P., Alfano, C.M., Povoski, S.P., Lipari, A.M., Agnese, D.M., Arnold, M.W., Farrar, W.B., Yee, L.D.

Health Psychology, 38, 1310-1317.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical health===
Chronic loneliness can be a serious, life-threatening health condition. It has been found to be associated with an increased risk of [[stroke]] and [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="pfizer"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Loneliness and Isolation: Modern Health Risks|url = http://www.thepfizerjournal.com/default.asp?a=article&amp;j=tpj15&amp;t=Loneliness%20and%20Isolation%3A%20Modern%20Health%20Risks|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060128104835/http://www.thepfizerjournal.com/default.asp?a=article&amp;j=tpj15&amp;t=Loneliness%20and%20Isolation%3A%20Modern%20Health%20Risks|archivedate = 28 January 2006|journal = The Pfizer Journal|year = 2000|volume = IV|issue = 4|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loneliness shows an increased incidence of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity.&lt;ref name="Cacioppo, J 2010 p218-227"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cacioppo | first1 = J. | last2 = Hawkley | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = Loneliness Matters: A Theorectical and Empirical Review of Consequences and Mechanisms | url = | journal = Annals of Behavioral Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 2| pages = 218–227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loneliness is shown to increase the concentration of [[cortisol]] levels in the body.&lt;ref name="Cacioppo, J 2010 p218-227"/&gt; Prolonged, high cortisol levels can cause anxiety, depression, digestive problems, heart disease, sleep problems, and weight gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/stress-management/in-depth/stress/art-20046037|title=Chronic stress puts your health at risk|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

″Loneliness has been associated with impaired cellular immunity as reflected in lower [[Natural killer cell|natural killer (NK) cell]] activity and higher antibody titers to the Epstein Barr Virus and human herpes viruses".&lt;ref name="Cacioppo, J 2010 p218-227"/&gt; Because of impaired cellular immunity, loneliness among young adults shows vaccines, like the flu vaccine, to be less effective.&lt;ref name="Cacioppo, J 2010 p218-227"/&gt; Data from studies on loneliness and HIV positive men suggests loneliness increases disease progression.&lt;ref name="Cacioppo, J 2010 p218-227"/&gt;

===Physiological mechanisms link to poor health===

There are a number of potential physiological mechanisms linking loneliness to poor health outcomes. In 2005, results from the American ''[[Framingham Heart Study]]'' demonstrated that lonely men had raised levels of [[Interleukin 6|Interleukin 6 (IL-6)]], a blood chemical linked to [[heart disease]]. A 2006 study conducted by the ''Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience'' at the [[University of Chicago]] found loneliness can add thirty points to a blood pressure reading for adults over the age of fifty. Another finding, from a survey conducted by [[John Cacioppo]] from the [[University of Chicago]], is that doctors report providing better [[Health care|medical care]] to patients who have a strong network of family and friends than they do to patients who are alone. Cacioppo states that loneliness impairs [[cognition]] and [[will (philosophy)|willpower]], alters [[DNA]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] in [[White blood cell|immune cells]], and leads over time to [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]].&lt;ref name="Science of Loneliness.com"/&gt; Lonelier people are more likely to show evidence of viral reactivation than less lonely people.&lt;ref name = "Ja_herpesvirus"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2012.11.016 |title=Loneliness predicts pain, depression, and fatigue: Understanding the role of immune dysregulation |year=2013 |last1=Jaremka |first1=Lisa M. |last2=Fagundes |first2=Christopher P. |last3=Glaser |first3=Ronald |last4=Bennett |first4=Jeanette M. |last5=Malarkey |first5=William B. |last6=Kiecolt-Glaser |first6=Janice K. |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=38 |issue=8 |pages=1310–7 |pmid=23273678 |pmc=3633610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lonelier people also have stronger inflammatory responses to acute stress compared with less lonely people; inflammation is a well known risk factor for age-related diseases.&lt;ref name = "Ja_inflammation"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0956797612464059 |title=Loneliness Promotes Inflammation During Acute Stress |year=2013 |last1=Jaremka |first1=Lisa M. |last2=Fagundes |first2=Christopher P. |last3=Peng |first3=Juan |last4=Bennett |first4=Jeanette M. |last5=Glaser |first5=Ronald |last6=Malarkey |first6=William B. |last7=Kiecolt-Glaser |first7=Janice K. |journal=Psychological Science |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=1089–97 |pmid=23630220 |pmc=3825089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When someone feels left out of a situation, they feel excluded and one possible side effect is for their body temperature to decrease. When people feel excluded blood vessels at the periphery of the body may narrow, preserving core body heat. This class protective mechanism is known as vasoconstriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ijzerman|first=Hans|title=Getting the cold shoulder|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/opinion/sunday/the-chill-of-loneliness.html|accessdate=1 November 2012|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments and prevention==
There are many different ways used to treat loneliness, [[social isolation]], and [[clinical depression]]. The first step that most doctors recommend to patients is [[therapy]]. Therapy is a common and effective way of treating loneliness and is often successful. Short-term therapy, the most common form for lonely or depressed patients, typically occurs over a period of ten to twenty weeks. During therapy, emphasis is put on understanding the cause of the problem, reversing the negative thoughts, feelings, and attitudes resulting from the problem, and exploring ways to help the patient feel connected. Some doctors also recommend [[group therapy]] as a means to connect with other sufferers and establish a support system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depression.com/psychotherapy.html |title=Psychotherapy |accessdate=29 March 2008 |work=Depression.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors also frequently prescribe [[anti-depressants]] to patients as a stand-alone treatment, or in conjunction with therapy. It may take several attempts before a suitable anti-depressant medication is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=The Truth About Antidepressants | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.webmd.com/depression/features/truth-about-antidepressants?page=2 | work =WebMD | pages = | accessdate = 30 March 2008 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative approaches to treating depression are suggested by many doctors. These treatments include [[exercise]], [[dieting]], [[hypnosis]], [[electro-shock therapy]], [[acupuncture]], and [[herbal remedies|herbs]], amongst others. Many patients find that participating in these activities fully or partially alleviates symptoms related to depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Alternative treatments for depression | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.webmd.com/depression/alternative-therapies-depression?page=2 | work =WebMD | pages = | accessdate = 30 March 2008 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paro robot.jpg|thumb|[[Paro (robot)|Paro]], a robot pet seal classified as a medical device by U.S. regulators]]
Another treatment for both loneliness and depression is [[pet]] therapy, or [[animal-assisted therapy]], as it is more formally known. Studies and surveys, as well as [[anecdotal evidence]] provided by volunteer and community organizations, indicate that the presence of animal companions such as [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[rabbit]]s, and [[guinea pig]]s can ease feelings of depression and loneliness among some sufferers. Beyond the companionship the animal itself provides there may also be increased opportunities for socializing with other pet owners. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] there are a number of other health benefits associated with pet ownership, including lowered [[blood pressure]] and decreased levels of [[cholesterol]] and [[triglycerides]].&lt;ref name="Pets"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/health_benefits.htm Health Benefits of Pets] (from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]). Retrieved 14 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nostalgia]] has also been found to have a restorative effect, counteracting loneliness by increasing perceived social support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02194.x |title=Counteracting Loneliness: On the Restorative Function of Nostalgia |year=2008 |last1=Zhou |first1=Xinyue |last2=Sedikides |first2=Constantine |last3=Wildschut |first3=Tim |last4=Gao |first4=Ding-Guo |journal=Psychological Science |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=1023–9 |pmid=19000213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1989 study found that the social aspect of [[religion]] had a significant negative association with loneliness among [[elderly]] people. The effect was more consistent than the effect of social relationships with family and friends, and the subjective concept of [[religiosity]] had no significant effect on loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/073346488900800109 |title=Religiosity and Loneliness Among the Elderly |year=1989 |last1=Johnson |first1=D. P. |last2=Mullins |first2=L. C. |journal=Journal of Applied Gerontology |volume=8 |pages=110–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study compared the effectiveness of four interventions: improving social skills, enhancing social support, increasing opportunities for social interaction, addressing abnormal social cognition (faulty thoughts and patterns of thoughts). The results of the study indicated that all interventions were effective in reducing loneliness, possibly with the exception of social skill training. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that correcting maladaptive social cognition offers the best chance of reducing loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1088868310377394 |title=A Meta-Analysis of Interventions to Reduce Loneliness |year=2010 |last1=Masi |first1=C.

'''Maria the Korean Bride''', is a [[New York City|New York]]-based [[performance artist]] and [[filmmaker]]. She is best known for her extended performance art project and film where in the course of nine years, she gets married in all 50 of the United States, [[Puerto Rico]], the [[District of Columbia]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref name=Bozeman/&gt;

==Background and education==
Born in [[Seoul]], the oldest of three,&lt;ref name=Yahoo&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/style/always-a-bride-woman-weds-50-times-in-50-states-110691614387.html|date=11 February 2015|title=Never a Bridesmaid, Always a Bride — Woman Weds 50 Strangers in 50 States|last=Cooper|first=Brittany Jones|publisher=yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yoon's family immigrated to the US when she was seven. She grew up in [[Queens]], [[the Bronx]], and [[Staten Island]], [[New York City|New York]],&lt;ref name="Sarasota"/&gt; and attended [[Cooper Union]] for her [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]]. She attended [[Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariayoon.com/bio|website=Maria Yoon|title=Bio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==
Yoon felt an inordinate pressure from her parents and the [[Korean American]] community&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/the-daily-need/marriage-as-performance-art/10002/|publisher=pbs.org|date= 23 June 2011|last=Ko|first=Lisa|title=The Daily Need: Marriage As Performance Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; to marry after turning 30.&lt;ref name=DNA/&gt; She first responded by making a calendar full of bachelors who wanted to propose to her to start a conversation with her father. The ''Marriage Proposal Series 2003 Calendar'' sold out of its first printing at the [[New Museum]] bookstore.&lt;ref&gt;"Museums New York 2003: The Museum Goer's Handbook."&lt;/ref&gt; Yoon, however, felt the project reinforced [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] male roles.&lt;ref name=Yahoo/&gt;

==Maria the Korean Bride==
She took the [[hanbok]] her mother had given her for her 30th birthday and decided to make a further art project out of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/nine-years-50-weddings-50-states-meet-maria-korean-bride-n306951|title=Nine Years, 50 Weddings, 50 States: Meet Maria the Korean Bride|publisher=Nbcnews.com|date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She started by marrying two people in [[Las Vegas]] on a friend's vacation trip.&lt;ref name=Yahoo/&gt; She married in [[Hawaii]] in a traditional wedding ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://honoluluweekly.com/city-wise/2010/05/hanbok-off-the-hook/|title=Hanbok Off the Hook|publisher=Honolulu Weekly|last=Seeto|first=Margot|date=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Detroit]], she married an artist dressed as Death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN-GDiPlqOE|title=Maria the Korean Bride in Detroit, Michigan (aka 49th Wedding)|publisher=YouTube|author=Maria the Korean Bride|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she experienced racism in [[Wisconsin]], she married a shirt representing the company where she experienced the incident. Her final wedding was held in [[Times Square]] in New York City, officiated by Jimmy McMillan, of the [[Rent is Too Damn High]] party. Yoon selected her husband from a raffle.&lt;ref name=DNA/&gt;

Yoon writes the all vows herself and never smiles out of cultural respect&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; and to honor Korean wedding ceremony custom. She has expressed that [[Wyoming]] was her favorite experience in the U.S. for the change of scenery it offered and people's friendliness.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt; Though awarded a number of grants and donations, the project was largely self-funded.&lt;ref name=Sarasota&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ticket.heraldtribune.com/2013/04/04/the-many-marriages-of-maria-the-korean-bride/|title=The many marriages of 'Maria the Korean Bride'|date=4 April 2014|last=Seidman|first=Carrie|publisher=Sarasota Herald Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mariathekoreanbride.com/content/support|publisher=Maria the Korean Bride website|title=Support}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to the work===
In [[Montana]], the minister, a recent newlywed, said "She’s asking some really good questions about the institution."&lt;ref name=Bozeman&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/article_20421f36-b719-11df-b158-001cc4c002e0.html|title=Artist’s wedding asks: What is marriage?|publisher=Bozeman Daily Chronicle|date=3 September 2010|last=Person|first=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Hampshire]] Yoon got lectured by a minister on the project and there have been people who have bowed out of the project because of her support of [[gay marriage]].&lt;ref name=NYfolklore&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nyfolklore.org/pubs/voic36-1-2/praise.html|title=Maria Yoon|publisher=Voices: The Journal of New York Folklore|volume=10|date=Spring–Summer 2010|last=Condon|first=Eileen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ghost weddings==

After learning about police in [[northwest China]] charging a man with murdering two women with mental disabilities, alleging that he wanted to sell their corpses to be used in so-called "ghost weddings" on [[BBC.com]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-37103447|date=24 August 2016|title=China's ghost weddings and why they can be deadly|last=Tsoi|first=Grace|publisher=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yoon took an interest in incorporating the old practice of marrying the dead into her work. In July 2017, after a local Taoist priest had an omen that marrying a deceased man would be unlucky, Yoon married an imaginary husband at a [[Taoist temple]] in the [[Xizhi District]] of [[New Taipei City]], [[Taiwan]]. She wore a pink ''hanbok'' with her wrist tied with a red string to a [[memorial tablet]] representing the fake individual. Still, many Taiwanese avoided attending the filming of the performance out of superstition, and the priest ritually cleansed the film crew with incense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2017/07/06/2003673981/1|publisher=Taipei Times|date=6 July 2017|title=Wedding a Taiwanese ghost in a Korean dress|last=Cheung|first=Han}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]] and [[probability theory]], '''mean field theory''' ('''MFT''' also known as '''self-consistent field theory''') studies the behavior of large and complex [[stochastic]] models by studying a simpler model. Such models consider a large number of small individual components that interact with each other. The effect of all the other individuals on any given individual is approximated by a single averaged effect, thus reducing a [[many-body problem]] to a [[one-body problem]].

The ideas first appeared in physics in the work of [[Pierre Curie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kadanoff | first1 = L. P. | authorlink1 = Leo Kadanoff| title = More is the Same; Phase Transitions and Mean Field Theories | doi = 10.1007/s10955-009-9814-1 | journal = Journal of Statistical Physics | volume = 137 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 777–797 | year = 2009 | arxiv = 0906.0653| pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2009JSP...137..777K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pierre Weiss]] to describe [[phase transitions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = L'hypothèse du champ moléculaire et la propriété ferromagnétique | first = Pierre | last = Weiss | authorlink = Pierre Weiss | journal = J.

Approaches inspired by these ideas have seen applications in [[epidemic model]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Boudec | first1 = J. Y.

A [[many-body system]] with interactions is generally very difficult to solve exactly, except for extremely simple cases ([[random field]] theory, 1D [[Ising model]]). The n-body system is replaced by a 1-body problem with a chosen good external field. The external field replaces the interaction of all the other particles to an arbitrary particle.  The great difficulty (e.g., when computing the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] of the system) is the treatment of [[combinatorics]] generated by the interaction terms in the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] when summing over all states. The goal of mean field theory is to resolve these combinatorial problems. MFT is known under a great many names and guises. Similar techniques include [[Bragg–Williams approximation]], models on [[Bethe lattice]], [[Landau theory]], [[Pierre–Weiss approximation]], [[Flory–Huggins solution theory]], and [[Scheutjens–Fleer theory]].

The main idea of MFT is to replace all interactions to any one body with an average or effective interaction, sometimes called a ''molecular field''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaikin|first=P. M.  |first2=T. C. |last2=Lubensky |title=Principles of condensed matter physics|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-79450-3|edition=4th print}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reduces any multi-body problem into an effective one-body problem.  The ease of solving MFT problems means that some insight into the behavior of the system can be obtained at a relatively low cost.

In [[classical field theory|field theory]], the Hamiltonian may be expanded in terms of the magnitude of fluctuations around the mean of the field.  In this context, MFT can be viewed as the "zeroth-order" expansion of the Hamiltonian in fluctuations.  Physically, this means an MFT system has no fluctuations, but this coincides with the idea that one is replacing all interactions with a "mean field".  Quite often, in the formalism of fluctuations, MFT provides a convenient launch-point to studying first or second order fluctuations.

In general, dimensionality plays a strong role in determining whether a mean-field approach will work for any particular problem.  In MFT, many interactions are replaced by one effective interaction.  Then it naturally follows that if the field or particle exhibits many interactions in the original system, MFT will be more accurate for such a system.  This is true in cases of high dimensionality, when the Hamiltonian includes long-range forces, or when the particles are extended (e.g., polymers). The [[Ginzburg criterion]] is the formal expression of how fluctuations render MFT a poor approximation, often depending upon the number of spatial dimensions in the system of interest.

While MFT arose primarily in the field of [[statistical mechanics]], it has more recently been applied elsewhere, for example in [[inference]], [[graphical models]] theory, [[neuroscience]], and [[artificial intelligence]].

==Formal approach==
The formal basis for mean field theory is the [[Helmholtz free energy#Bogoliubov inequality|Bogoliubov inequality]]. This inequality states that the [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of a system with Hamiltonian

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}_0 + \Delta \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;

has the following upper bound:

:&lt;math&gt;F \leq F_0 \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \langle \mathcal{H} \rangle_0 - T S_0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[entropy]] and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt; are Helmholtz free energies. The average is taken over the equilibrium ensemble of the reference system with Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_{0}&lt;/math&gt;. In the special case that the reference Hamiltonian is that of a non-interacting system and can thus be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_0 = \sum_{i=1}^N h_i \left( \xi_i \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\left(\xi_i\right) &lt;/math&gt; is shorthand for the [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the individual components of our statistical system (atoms, spins and so forth), one can consider sharpening the upper bound by minimizing the right hand side of the inequality. The minimizing reference system is then the "best" approximation to the true system using non-correlated degrees of freedom, and is known as the '''mean field approximation'''.

For the most common case that the target Hamiltonian contains only pairwise interactions, ''i.e.,''

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H} = \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{P}} V_{i,j} \left( \xi_i, \xi_j \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of pairs that interact, the minimizing procedure can be carried out formally. Define &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}_i f(\xi_i)&lt;/math&gt; as the generalized sum of the observable &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over the degrees of freedom of the single component (sum for discrete variables, integrals for continuous ones). The approximating free energy is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  F_{0} ={} &amp;\operatorname{Tr}_{1,2,\ldots,N} \mathcal{H} \left(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_N\right) P^{(N)}_0 \left(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_N\right) \\
            &amp;{} + kT \,\operatorname{Tr}_{1,2,\ldots,N} P^{(N)}_0 \left(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_N\right) \log P^{(N)}_0 \left(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_N\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P^{(N)}_{0}(\xi_{1},\xi_{2},...,\xi_{N})&lt;/math&gt; is the probability to find the reference system in the state specified by the variables &lt;math&gt;(\xi_{1},\xi_{2},...,\xi_{N})&lt;/math&gt;. This probability is given by the normalized [[Boltzmann factor]]
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  P^{(N)}_0(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_N)
    &amp; {}= \frac{1}{Z^{(N)}_0} e^{-\beta \mathcal{H}_0 (\xi_1, \xi_2, \ldots, \xi_N)} \\
    &amp; {}= \prod_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{Z_0} e^{-\beta h_i \left( \xi_i \right)} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \prod_{i=1}^N P^{(i)}_0 (\xi_i)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; Z_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]].  Thus
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  F_0 ={} &amp;\sum_{(i,j)\in\mathcal{P}} \operatorname{Tr}_{i,j} V_{i,j} \left( \xi_i,\xi_j \right) P^{(i)}_0 (\xi_i) P^{(j)}_0 (\xi_j)  \\
          &amp;{} + kT \sum_{i=1}^N \operatorname{Tr}_i P^{(i)}_0 (\xi_i) \log P^{(i)}_0 (\xi_i).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In order to minimize we take the derivative with respect to the single degree-of-freedom probabilities &lt;math&gt;P^{(i)}_0&lt;/math&gt; using a [[Lagrange multiplier]] to ensure proper normalization. The end result is the set of self-consistency equations
:&lt;math&gt;P^{(i)}_0(\xi_i) = \frac{1}{Z_0} e^{-\beta h_i^{MF}(\xi_i)}\qquad i = 1, 2, \ldots, N&lt;/math&gt;

where the mean field is given by
:&lt;math&gt;h_i^{MF}\left(\xi_i\right) = \sum_{\{j|(i,j)\in\mathcal{P}\}} \operatorname{Tr}_j V_{i,j} \left( \xi_i,\xi_j \right) P^{(j)}_0 \left(\xi_j\right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
Mean field theory can be applied to a number of physical systems so as to study phenomena such as [[phase transitions]].&lt;ref name=Stanley&gt;

===Ising Model===
Consider the [[Ising model]] on a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional lattice.  The Hamiltonian is given by
:&lt;math&gt;H = -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} s_i s_j - h \sum_i s_i&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle}&lt;/math&gt; indicates summation over the pair of nearest neighbors &lt;math&gt;\langle i,j \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;s_i = \pm 1&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;s_j&lt;/math&gt; are neighboring Ising spins.

Let us transform our spin variable by introducing the fluctuation from its mean value &lt;math&gt; m_i \equiv \langle s_i \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. We may rewrite the Hamiltonian:
:&lt;math&gt;H = -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \left(m_i + \delta s_i\right)\left(m_j + \delta s_j\right) - h \sum_i s_i&lt;/math&gt;

where we define &lt;math&gt; \delta s_i \equiv  s_i - m_i &lt;/math&gt;; this is the ''fluctuation'' of the spin.

If we expand the right hand side, we obtain one term that is entirely dependent on the mean values of the spins, and independent of the spin configurations.  This is the trivial term, which does not affect the statistical properties of the system.  The next term is the one involving the product of the mean value of the spin and the fluctuation value.  Finally, the last term involves a product of two fluctuation values.

The mean-field approximation consists of neglecting this second order fluctuation term. These fluctuations are enhanced at low dimensions, making MFT a better approximation for high dimensions.

:&lt;math&gt;H \approx H^{MF} \equiv -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \left(m_i m_j + m_i \delta s_j + m_j \delta s_i \right) - h \sum_i s_i&lt;/math&gt;

Again, the summand can be reexpanded. In addition, we expect that the mean value of each spin is site-independent, since the Ising chain is translationally invariant. This yields

:&lt;math&gt;H^{MF} = -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \left( m^2 + 2m(s_i - m) \right) - h \sum_i s_i&lt;/math&gt;

The summation over neighboring spins can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt; \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i \sum_{j\in nn(i)}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;nn(i)&lt;/math&gt; means 'nearest-neighbor of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;' and the &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; prefactor avoids double-counting, since each bond participates in two spins. Simplifying leads to the final expression
:&lt;math&gt;H^{MF} = \frac{J m^2 N z}{2} - \underbrace{(h + m J z)}_{h^\text{eff}} \sum_i s_i &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the [[coordination number]]. At this point, the Ising Hamiltonian has been ''decoupled'' into a sum of one-body Hamiltonians with an ''effective mean-field'' &lt;math&gt;h^\text{eff} = h + J z m&lt;/math&gt; which is the sum of the external field &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and of the ''mean-field'' induced by the neighboring spins. It is worth noting that this mean field directly depends on the number of nearest neighbors and thus on the dimension of the system (for instance, for a hypercubic lattice of dimension &lt;math&gt; d&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; z = 2 d&lt;/math&gt;).

Substituting this Hamiltonian into the partition function, and solving the effective 1D problem, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt; Z = e^{-\frac{\beta J m^2 Nz}{2}} \left[2 \cosh\left(\frac{h + m J z}{k_BT} \right)\right]^N &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; is the number of lattice sites.  This is a closed and exact expression for the partition function of the system.  We may obtain the free energy of the system, and calculate [[critical exponent]]s. In particular, we can obtain the magnetization &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;h^{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;/math&gt;.

We thus have two equations between &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h^\text{eff}&lt;/math&gt;, allowing us to determine &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; as a function of temperature. This leads to the following observation:
* for temperatures greater than a certain value &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt;, the only solution is &lt;math&gt;m = 0&lt;/math&gt;. The system is paramagnetic.
* for &lt;math&gt;T &lt; T_c&lt;/math&gt;, there are two non-zero solutions: &lt;math&gt; m = \pm m_0 &lt;/math&gt;. The system is ferromagnetic.

&lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; is given by the following relation: &lt;math&gt; T_c = \frac{J z}{k_B} &lt;/math&gt;.
This shows that MFT can account for the ferromagnetic phase transition.

===Application to other systems===
Similarly, MFT can be applied to other types of Hamiltonian as in the following cases:
* To study the metal-[[superconductor]] transition. In this case, the analog of the magnetization is the superconducting gap &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;.
* The molecular field of a [[liquid crystal]] that emerges when the [[Laplacian]] of the director field is non-zero.
* To determine the optimal [[amino acid]] [[side chain]] packing given a fixed [[tertiary structure|protein backbone]] in [[protein structure prediction]] (see [[Self-consistent mean field (biology)]]).
* To determine the [[elasticity (physics)|elastic properties]] of a composite material.

==Extension to time-dependent mean fields==
{{Main|Dynamical mean field theory}}

In mean-field theory, the mean field appearing in the single-site problem is a scalar or vectorial time-independent quantity. However, this need not always be the case: in a variant of mean-field theory called [[dynamical mean field theory]] (DMFT), the mean-field becomes a time-dependent quantity. For instance, DMFT can be applied to the [[Hubbard model]] to study the metal-Mott insulator transition.

By combining these omes into a set of omes, scientists can analyze complex biololgical [[big data]] efficiently enough to easily find relevant [[biomarkers]]. In so doing, multiomics integrates diverse omics data to find a coherently matching geno-pheno-envirotype relationship or association, even with reduced numbers of samples, although multiomics usually involves 'big' data.

Usually, a very large number of samples is required to detect functional relationships, but, using multiomics, encompassing multiple data types, researchers try to detect such associations with more confidence. A possible example case would be suicide [[biomarker]] detection by taking the blood of [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]] patients and performing genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic sequencing, combining these omes to find significant markers from the case population.

The '''Nihoa millerbird''' (''Acrocephalus familiaris kingi'') is a subspecies of the [[millerbird]]. It gets its name from its preferred food, the Miller moth. The {{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}} long millerbird has dark, [[Sepia (color)|sepia]]-colored feathers, white belly, and dark beak. Its natural geographic range is limited to the tiny [[island]] of [[Nihoa]] in the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]], and it is hoped that birds translocated to [[Laysan]] will help to ensure the survival of the species. The Nihoa millerbird is one of the two endemic birds remaining on Nihoa, the other being the [[Nihoa finch]].

Only 200– 900 Nihoa millerbirds persist on the island, making the species seriously endangered. It is always at risk of extinction from environmental changes (droughts, fires, insect population irruptions), because flight away from the island would likely prove fatal. The [[Laysan millerbird]], now extinct, was closely related.[http://www.fws.gov/pacificislands/wesa/millerbirdniho.html#]

The trinomial commemorates [[Samuel Wilder King]], captain of the [[Tanager Expedition]] and later Governor of Hawaii.

[[File:Acrocephalus familiaris -Laysan, Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, USA-8.jpg|right|thumb|A millerbird wearing coloured leg bands shortly after translocation from Nihoa to [[Laysan]]]]
24 Nihoa millerbirds were translocated by ship about {{convert|650|mi}} from Nihoa to [[Laysan]] in September 2011 after years of planning with the aim of establishing a second population of the species on Laysan. Mark MacDonald, a graduate student from the University of New Brunswick in Canada, lead a team that was working with the Service to collect information needed for translocations. From July through September 2007, MacDonald and his team captured and banded Nihoa millerbirds, collected body measurements, assessed body fat and breeding condition, identified individual territories and analyzed vocalizations, conducted feeding experiments, collected fecal samples, observed behavior to determine diet composition, noted the presence and abundance of non-native grasshoppers, and sampled the insect community on both Nihoa and Laysan to assess the millerbird’s potential prey base. MacDonald’s study estimated the Nihoa millerbird’s population at approximately 800 individuals – a relatively high number in 40 years of low and fluctuating numbers. He believes that this could be attributed not only to high numbers of birds present during the survey period but also a larger survey area, the use of more experienced observers, or (most likely) the greater visibility of the birds during the late summer, when vegetation cover is most limited.

Using mist nets, 85 Nihoa millerbirds (60 males and 25 females) were captured and banded. Banding permits identification of previously captured birds and reduces stress that can be caused by multiple captures. Most importantly, however, banding allows individual birds to be identified in the field and enables biologists to identify pairs, map their territories, and track individual survival from year to year through repeat sightings. Photographs and measurements of wing and tail feathers were taken from each individual, as well as small feather samples for genetic analysis. Growth bars visible on the tail feathers can help scientists determine the age of the bird, and comparison of photographs and measurements with results of lab analyses will aid in finding a way to sex Nihoa millerbirds in the field. Development of these methods will ensure that the right numbers of male and female birds are moved to Laysan.
Several Nihoa millerbirds were placed in a temporary enclosure and presented with a selection of island insects. The purpose was to identify millerbird dietary preferences and see if the birds would eat in captivity. Preliminary results showed that the birds fed readily from a plastic container of prey items. Of the choices offered, they left behind only lady bugs, sow-bugs, and ants. One bird was quick to chase down fast-moving cockroaches before taking smaller, slower insects such as spiders and beetles. Another test with a male and female showed that, after a brief adjustment period, the pair fed together without hesitation.
Using an iPod and a speaker, the team played millerbird songs within the territories of all 60 banded males and recorded the responses with a microphone. These recordings were used to determine the territories of 20 males and will also be analyzed to determine if differences exist in millerbird songs across Nihoa. Preliminary spectrograph analysis of the recordings shows variety among the songs of male millerbirds, but more research is needed to determine if these differences are significant. Identifying millerbird dialects on such a small spatial scale would be a novel finding and a major accomplishment of the expedition.

Thanks to MacDonald and his team, the Service is one step closer to establishing a second population and greatly reducing the risk of extinction for the Nihoa millerbird.

The birds were provided with different combinations of coloured leg bands to help identification of individual birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.vocuspr.com/Newsroom/Query.aspx?SiteName=FWS&amp;Entity=PRAsset&amp;SF_PRAsset_PRAssetID_EQ=128401&amp;XSL=PressRelease&amp;Cache=True |title=Release of Nihoa Millerbirds on Laysan Island Offers New Hope for Critically Endangered Species |publisher=US Fish &amp; Wildlife service |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35220">'''Optimism bias''' (also known as '''unrealistic''' or '''comparative optimism''') is a [[cognitive bias]] that causes a person to believe that they are at a lesser risk of experiencing a negative event compared to others. Optimism bias is quite common and transcends gender, ethnicity, nationality and age.&lt;ref name=Neural&gt;O’Sullivan, Owen P. (2015). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-09.pdf The neural basis of always looking on the bright side.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''8'''(1):11–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Optimistic biases are even reported in non-human animals such as rats and birds. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-12-06|title=The optimism bias|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211011912|journal=Current Biology|language=en|volume=21|issue=23|pages=R941–R945|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.030|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four factors exist that cause a person to be optimistically biased: their desired end state, their cognitive mechanisms, the information they have about themselves versus others, and overall mood.&lt;ref name="shepperd2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shepperd |first=James A. |author2=Patrick Carroll |author3=Jodi Grace |author4=Meredith Terry  |title=Exploring the Causes of Comparative Optimism |journal=Psychologica Belgica |year=2002 |volume=42 |pages=65–98 |url=http://www.psych.ufl.edu/~shepperd/articles/PsychBelgica2002.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.507.9932}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optimistic bias is seen in a number of situations. For example: people believing that they are less at risk of being a crime victim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chapin |first=John |author2=Grace Coleman |title=Optimistic Bias: What you Think, What you Know, or Whom you Know? |journal=North American Journal of Psychology |year=2009 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=121–132 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286894666}}&lt;/ref&gt; smokers believing that they are less likely to contract lung cancer or disease than other smokers, first-time bungee jumpers believing that they are less at risk of an injury than other jumpers,&lt;ref name="weinstein1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weinstein |first=Neil D. |author2=William M. Klein |title=Unrealistic Optimism: Present and Future |journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology |year=1996 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.1521/jscp.1996.15.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or traders who think they are less exposed to losses in the markets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Elder|Elder; Alexander]] "Trading for a Living; Psychology, Trading Tactics, Money Management" [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] 1993, Intro – sections "Psychology is the Key" &amp; "The Odds are against You", And Part I "Individual Psychology", Section 5 "Fantasy versus Reality" {{ISBN|0-471-59224-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the optimism bias occurs for both positive events, such as believing oneself to be more financially successful than others, and negative events, such as being less likely to have a drinking problem, there is more research and evidence suggesting that the bias is stronger for negative events (the '''valence effect''').&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gouveia2001&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gouveia |first=Susana O. |author2=Valerie Clarke |title=Optimistic bias for negative and positive events |journal=Health Education |year=2001 |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=228–234
|doi=10.1108/09654280110402080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different consequences result from these two types of events: positive events often lead to feelings of well being and self-esteem, while negative events lead to consequences involving more risk, such as engaging in risky behaviors and not taking precautionary measures for safety.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt;

== Measuring ==
Optimism bias is typically measured through two determinants of [[risk]]: absolute risk, where individuals are asked to estimate their likelihood of experiencing a negative event compared to their actual chance of experiencing a negative event (comparison against self), and comparative risk, where individuals are asked to estimate the likelihood of experiencing a negative event (their personal risk estimate) compared to others of the same age and sex (a target risk estimate).&lt;ref name=gouveia2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=helweg-larsen2001&gt;{{cite journal |last=Helweg-Larsen |first=Marie |author2=James A. Shepperd |title=Do Moderators of the Optimistic Bias Affect Personal or Target Risk Estimates? A Review of the Literature |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review |year=2001 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=74–95 |url=http://users.dickinson.edu/~helwegm/pdfversion/do_moderators_of_the_optimistic_bias.pdf |doi=10.1207/S15327957PSPR0501_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems can occur when trying to measure absolute risk because it is extremely difficult to determine the actual risk statistic for a person.&lt;ref name=helweg-larsen2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=klein2002&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klein |first=Cynthia T. F. |author2=Marie Helweg-Larsen |title=Perceived Control and the Optimistic Bias: A Meta-analytic Review |journal=Psychology and Health |year=2002 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=437–446 |doi=10.1080/0887044022000004920 |url=http://www2.dickinson.edu/departments/psych/helwegm/PDFVersion/Perceived_control_and_the_optimistic.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the optimistic bias is primarily measured in comparative risk forms, where people compare themselves against others, through direct and indirect comparisons.&lt;ref name=weinstein1996 /&gt; Direct comparisons ask whether an individual's own risk of experiencing an event is less than, greater than, or equal to someone else's risk, while indirect comparisons ask individuals to provide separate estimates of their own risk of experiencing an event and other's risk of experiencing the same event.&lt;ref name=helweg-larsen2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=radcliffe2002&gt;{{cite journal |last=Radcliffe |first=Nathan M. |author2=William M. P. Klein |title=Dispositional, Unrealistic, and Comparative Optimism: Differential Relations with the Knowledge and Processing of Risk Information and Beliefs about Personal Risk |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |year=2002 |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=836–846 |doi=10.1177/0146167202289012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining scores, researchers are able to use the information to determine if there is a difference in the average risk estimate of the individual compared to the average risk estimate of their peers. Generally in negative events, the mean risk of an individual appears lower than the risk estimate of others.&lt;ref name=helweg-larsen2001 /&gt; This is then used to demonstrate the bias' effect. The optimistic bias can only be defined at a group level, because at an individual level the positive assessment could be true.&lt;ref name=gouveia2001 /&gt; Likewise, difficulties can arise in measurement procedures, as it is difficult to determine when someone is being optimistic, realistic, or pessimistic.&lt;ref name=helweg-larsen2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=radcliffe2002 /&gt; Research suggests that the bias comes from an overestimate of group risks rather than underestimating one's own risk.&lt;ref name=helweg-larsen2001 /&gt;

An example: participants assigned a higher probability to picking a card that had a smiling face on its reverse side than one which had a frowning face.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Nigel, ''Making Actuaries Less Human: Lessons from Behavioral Finance''. The Staple Inn Actuarial Society, 2000-01-18. Last accessed on 2009-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors ==
The factors leading to the optimistic bias can be categorized into four different groups: desired end states of comparative judgment, [[cognitive]] mechanisms, information about the self versus a target, and underlying [[affect (psychology)|affect]].&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt; These are explained more in detail below.

=== Desired end states of comparative judgment ===
Many explanations for the optimistic bias come from the goals that people want and outcomes they wish to see.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt; People tend to view their risks as less than others because they believe that this is what other people want to see. These explanations include [[self-enhancement]], self-presentation, and [[perceived control]].

==== Self-enhancement ====
Self-enhancement suggests that optimistic predictions are satisfying and that it feels good to think that positive events will happen.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt; People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt; People tend to focus on finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what will happen to them.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt; With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome to be. This also suggests that people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt;

==== Self-presentation ====
Studies suggest that people attempt to establish and maintain a desired personal image in social situations. People are motivated to present themselves towards others in a good light, and some researchers suggest that the optimistic bias is a representative of self-presentational processes: people want to appear more well-off than others. However, this is not through conscious effort. In a study where participants believed their driving skills would be either tested in either real-life or driving simulations, people who believed they were to be tested had less optimistic bias and were more modest about their skills than individuals who would not be tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKenna |first=F. P |author2=R. A. Stanier |author3=C. Lewis  |title=Factors underlying illusionary self-assessment of driving skill in males and females |journal=Accident Analysis and Prevention |year=1991 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=45–52 |doi=10.1016/0001-4575(91)90034-3 |pmid=2021403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies also suggest that individuals who present themselves in a pessimistic and more negative light are generally less accepted by the rest of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helweg-Larsen|first=Marie|author2=Pedram Sadeghian |author3=Mary S. Webb |title=The stigma of being pessimistically biased|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|year=2002|volume=21|issue=1|pages=92–107|url=http://users.dickinson.edu/~helwegm/PDFVersion/The_Stigma_of_Being_Pessimistically_Biased.pdf|doi=10.1521/jscp.21.1.92.22405}}&lt;/ref&gt; This might contribute to overly optimistic attitudes.

==== Personal control/perceived control ====
People tend to be more optimistically biased when they believe they have more control over events than others.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=klein2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=harris1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Peter|title=Sufficient grounds for optimism?: The relationship between perceived controllability and optimistic bias|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|year=1996|volume=15|issue=1|pages=9–52|location=|doi=10.1521/jscp.1996.15.1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, people are more likely to think that they will not be harmed in a car accident if they are driving the vehicle.&lt;ref name=harris1996 /&gt; Another example is that if someone believes that they have a lot of control over becoming infected with HIV, they are more likely to view their risk of contracting the disease to be low.&lt;ref name=helweg-larsen2001 /&gt; Studies have suggested that the greater [[perceived control]] someone has, the greater their optimistic bias.&lt;ref name=harris1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=weinstein1980&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weinstein |first=Neil D. |title=Unrealistic optimism about future life events |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=1980 |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=806–820 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.39.5.806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stemming from this, control is a stronger factor when it comes to personal risk assessments, but not when assessing others.&lt;ref name=klein2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=harris1996 /&gt;

A meta-analysis reviewing the relationship between the optimistic bias and [[perceived control]] found that a number of moderators contribute to this relationship.&lt;ref name=klein2002 /&gt; In previous research, participants from the United States generally had higher levels of optimistic bias relating to perceived control than those of other nationalities. Students also showed larger levels of the optimistic bias than non-students.&lt;ref name=klein2002 /&gt; The format of the study also demonstrated differences in the relationship between perceived control and the optimistic bias: direct methods of measurement suggested greater perceived control and greater optimistic bias as compared to indirect measures of the bias.&lt;ref name=klein2002 /&gt; The optimistic bias is strongest in situations where an individual needs to rely heavily on direct action and responsibility of situations.&lt;ref name=klein2002 /&gt;

An opposite factor of [[perceived control]] is that of prior experience.&lt;ref name=helweg-larsen2001 /&gt; Prior experience is typically associated with less optimistic bias, which some studies suggest is from either a decrease in the perception of personal control, or make it easier for individuals to imagine themselves at risk.&lt;ref name=helweg-larsen2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=weinstein1980 /&gt; Prior experience suggests that events may be less controllable than previously believed.&lt;ref name=helweg-larsen2001 /&gt;

=== Cognitive mechanisms ===
The optimistic bias is possibly also influenced by three cognitive mechanisms that guide judgments and decision-making processes: the representativeness heuristic, singular target focus, and interpersonal distance.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt;

==== Representativeness heuristic ====
The estimates of likelihood associated with the optimistic bias are based on how closely an event matches a person's overall idea of the specific event.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt; Some researchers suggest that the [[representativeness heuristic]] is a reason for the optimistic bias: individuals tend to think in stereotypical categories rather than about their actual targets when making comparisons.&lt;ref name=weinstein1980 /&gt; For example, when drivers are asked to think about a car accident, they are more likely to associate a bad driver, rather than just the average driver.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt; Individuals compare themselves with the negative elements that come to mind, rather than an overall accurate comparison between them and another driver. Additionally, when individuals were asked to compare themselves towards friends, they chose more vulnerable friends based on the events they were looking at.&lt;ref name=perloff1986&gt;{{cite journal |last=Perloff |first=Linda S |author2=Barbara K. Fetzer |title=Self-other judgments and perceived vulnerability to victimization |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=1986 |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=502–510 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.3.502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals generally chose a specific friend based on whether they resemble a given example, rather than just an average friend.&lt;ref name=perloff1986 /&gt; People find examples that relate directly to what they are asked, resulting in representativeness heuristics.

==== Singular target focus ====
One of the difficulties of the optimistic bias is that people know more about themselves than they do about others. While individuals know how to think about themselves as a single person, they still think of others as a generalized group, which leads to biased estimates and inabilities to sufficiently understand their target or comparison group. Likewise, when making judgments and comparisons about their risk compared to others, people generally ignore the average person, but primarily focus on their own feelings and experiences.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt;

==== Interpersonal distance ====
Perceived risk differences occur depending on how far or close a compared target is to an individual making a risk estimate.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt; The greater the perceived distance between the self and the comparison target, the greater the perceived difference in risk. When one brings the comparison target closer to the individual, risk estimates appear closer together than if the comparison target was someone more distant to the participant.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt; There is support for perceived social distance in determining the optimistic bias.&lt;ref name=harris2000&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=P |author2=Wendy Middleton |author3=Richard Joiner  |title=The typical student as an in-group member: eliminating optimistic bias by reducing social distance |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |year=2000 |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=235–253 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0992(200003/04)30:2&lt;235::AID-EJSP990&gt;3.0.CO;2-G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through looking at comparisons of personal and target risk between the in-group level contributes to more perceived similarities than when individuals think about outer-group comparisons which lead to greater perceived differences.&lt;ref name=harris2000 /&gt; In one study, researchers manipulated the social context of the comparison group, where participants made judgements for two different comparison targets: the typical student at their university and a typical student at another university. Their findings showed that not only did people work with the closer comparison first, but also had closer ratings to themselves than the "more different" group.&lt;ref name=harris2000 /&gt;

Studies have also noticed that people demonstrate more optimistic bias when making comparisons when the other is a vague individual, but biases are reduced when the other is a familiar person, such as a friend or family member. This also is determined due to the information they have about the individuals closest to them, but not having the same information about other people.&lt;ref name=gouveia2001 /&gt;

=== Neurosciences ===
Functional neuroimaging suggests a key role for the rostral Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) in modulating both emotional processing and autobiographical retrieval. It is part of brain network showing extensive correlation between rostral ACC and amygdala during imagining of future positive events and restricted correlation during imagining of future negative events. Based on these data, it is suggested that the rostral ACC has a crucial part to play in creating positive images of the future and ultimately, in ensuring and maintaining the optimism bias.&lt;ref name=Neural/&gt;

=== Information about self versus target ===
Individuals know a lot more about themselves than they do about others.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt; Because information about others is less available, information about the self versus others leads people to make specific conclusions about their own risk, but results in them having a harder time making conclusions about the risks of others. This leads to differences in judgments and conclusions about self-risks compared to the risks of others, leading to larger gaps in the optimistic bias.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt;

==== Person-positivity bias ====
Person-[[positivity bias]] is the tendency to evaluate an object more favorably the more the object resembles an individual human being. Generally, the more a comparison target resembles a specific person, the more familiar it will be. However, groups of people are considered to be more abstract concepts, which leads to less favorable judgments. With regards to the optimistic bias, when people compare themselves to an average person, whether someone of the same sex or age, the target continues to be viewed as less human and less personified, which will result in less favorable comparisons between the self and others.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt;

==== Egocentric thinking ====
{{Main|Egotism}}
"Egocentric thinking" refers to how individuals know more of their own personal information and risk that they can use to form judgments and make decisions. One difficulty, though, is that people have a large amount of knowledge about themselves, but no knowledge about others. Therefore, when making decisions, people have to use other information available to them, such as population data, in order to learn more about their comparison group.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt; This can relate to an optimism bias because while people are using the available information they have about themselves, they have more difficulty understanding correct information about others.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt; 

It is also possible that someone can escape egocentric thinking. In one study, researchers had one group of participants list all factors that influenced their chances of experiencing a variety of events, and then a second group read the list. Those who read the list showed less optimistic bias in their own reports. It's possible that greater knowledge about others and their perceptions of their chances of risk bring the comparison group closer to the participant.&lt;ref name=weinstein1980 /&gt;

==== Underestimating average person's control ====
Also regarding egocentric thinking, it is possible that individuals underestimate the amount of control the average person has. This is explained in two different ways:
# People underestimate the control that others have in their lives.&lt;ref name=weinstein1980 /&gt;
# People completely overlook that others have control over their own outcomes.
For example, many smokers believe that they are taking all necessary precautionary measures so that they won't get lung cancer, such as smoking only once a day, or using filtered cigarettes, and believe that others are not taking the same precautionary measures. However, it is likely that many other smokers are doing the same things and taking those same precautions.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt;

=== Underlying affect ===
The last factor of optimistic bias is that of underlying [[affect (psychology)|affect]] and affect experience. Research has found that people show less optimistic bias when experiencing a negative mood, and more optimistic bias when in a positive mood.&lt;ref name=helweg-larsen2001 /&gt; Sad moods reflect greater memories of negative events, which lead to more negative judgments, while positive moods promote happy memories and more positive feelings.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt; This suggests that overall negative moods, including depression, result in increased personal risk estimates but less optimistic bias overall.&lt;ref name=helweg-larsen2001 /&gt; Anxiety also leads to less optimistic bias, continuing to suggest that overall positive experiences and positive attitudes lead to more optimistic bias in events.&lt;ref name=helweg-larsen2001 /&gt;

==Valence effect==
'''Valence effect''' is used to allude to the effect of [[valence (psychology)|valence]] on unrealistic optimism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gold|first1=Ron S.|last2=Sousa|first2=Phillip N. de|title=When does event valence affect unrealistic optimism?|journal=Psychology, Health &amp; Medicine|volume=17|issue=1|pages=105–115|doi=10.1080/13548506.2011.582503|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13548506.2011.582503}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been studied by Ron S. Gold and his team since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gold|first1=Ron S.|last2=Martyn|first2=Kate|title=Event Valence and Unrealistic Optimism|journal=Psychological Reports|date=6 December 2016|volume=92|issue=3_suppl|pages=1105–1109|doi=10.2466/pr0.2003.92.3c.1105}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They frame questions for the same event in different ways: "some participants were given information about the conditions that promote a given health-related event, such as developing heart disease, and were asked to rate the comparative likelihood that they would experience the event. Other participants were given matched information about the conditions that prevent the same event and were asked to rate the comparative likelihood that they would avoid the event". They have generally found that unrealistic optimism was greater for negative than positive valence.

== Consequences ==
In health, the optimistic bias tends to prevent individuals from taking on preventative measures for good health.&lt;ref name=bandb2010&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bränström |first=Richard |author2=Yvonne Brandberg |title=Health Risk Perception, Optimistic Bias, and Personal Satisfaction |journal=American Journal of Health Behavior |year=2010 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=197–205 |pmid=19814599 |url= |doi=10.5993/ajhb.34.2.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, researchers need to be aware of the optimistic bias and the ways it can prevent people from taking precautionary measures in life choices. For example, people who underestimate their comparative risk of heart disease know less about heart disease, and even after reading an article with more information, are still less concerned about risk of heart disease.&lt;ref name=radcliffe2002 /&gt; Because the optimistic bias can be a strong force in decision-making, it is important to look at how risk perception is determined and how this will result in preventative behaviors. Risk perceptions are particularly important for individual behaviors, such as exercise, diet, and even sunscreen use.&lt;ref name=brewer2007&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brewer |first=Noel T. |author2=Gretchen B. Chapman |author3=Fredrick X. Gibbons |author4=Meg Gerrard |author5=Kevin D. McCaul |author6=Neil D. Weinstein  |title=Meta-analysis of the Relationship Between Risk Perception and Health Behavior: The Example of Vaccination |journal=Health Psychology |year=2007 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=136–145 |doi=10.1037/0278-6133.26.2.136 |pmid=17385964 |url=http://www.unc.edu/~ntbrewer/pubs/2007,%20brewer,%20chpaman,%20gibbons,%20et%20al.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large portion of risk prevention focuses on adolescents. Especially with health risk perception, adolescence is associated with an increased frequency of risky health-related behaviors such as smoking, drugs, and unsafe sex. While adolescents are aware of the risk, this awareness does not change behavior habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gerrard |first=Meg |author2=Frederick X. Gibbons |author3=Alida C. Benthin |author4=Robert M.

However, many times there are methodological problems in these tests. Unconditional risk questions in cross-sectional studies are used consistently, leading to problems, as they ask about the likelihood of an action occurring, but does not determine if there is an outcome, or compare events that haven't happened to events that have.&lt;ref name=brewer2007 /&gt; Concerning vaccines, perceptions of those who have not been vaccinated are compared to the perceptions of people who have been. Other problems which arise include the failure to know a person's perception of a risk.&lt;ref name=brewer2007 /&gt; Knowing this information will be helpful for continued research on optimistic bias and preventative behaviors.

== Attempts to alter and eliminate ==
Studies have shown that it is very difficult to eliminate the optimistic bias; however, some people believe that trying to reduce the optimistic bias will encourage people to adapt to health-protective behaviors. Some researchers suggest that the optimistic bias cannot be reduced, and that by trying to reduce the optimistic bias the end result was generally even more optimistically biased.&lt;ref name=weinsteinklein1995&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weinstein |first=Neil D. |author2=William M. Klein |title=Resistance of Personal Risk Perceptions to Debiasing Interventions |journal=Health Psychology |year=1995 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=132–140 |doi=10.1037/0278-6133.14.2.132 |pmid=7789348}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of four different tests to reduce the optimistic bias, researchers found that regardless of the attempts to reduce the bias, through lists of risk factors, participants perceiving themselves as inferior to others, participants asked to think of high-risk individuals, and giving attributes of why they were at risk, all increased the bias rather than decreased it.&lt;ref name=weinsteinklein1995 /&gt; Although studies have tried to reduce the optimistic bias through reducing distance, overall, the optimistic bias still remains.&lt;ref name=harris2000 /&gt;

Although research has suggested that it is very difficult to eliminate the bias, some factors may help in closing the gap of the optimistic bias between an individual and their target risk group. First, by placing the comparison group closer to the individual, the optimistic bias can be reduced: studies found that when individuals were asked to make comparisons between themselves and close friends, there was almost no difference in the likelihood of an event occurring.&lt;ref name=perloff1986 /&gt; Additionally, actually experiencing an event leads to a decrease in the optimistic bias.&lt;ref name=helweg-larsen2001 /&gt; While this only applies to events with prior experience, knowing the previously unknown will result in less optimism of it not occurring.

== Policy, planning, and management ==
Optimism bias influences decisions and forecasts in policy, planning, and management, e.g., the costs and completion times of planned decisions tend to be underestimated and the benefits overestimated due to optimism bias. The term [[planning fallacy]] for this effect was first proposed by [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]].&lt;ref name="PezzoLitman2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pezzo|first1=Mark V.|last2=Litman|first2=Jordan A.|last3=Pezzo|first3=Stephanie P.|title=On the distinction between yuppies and hippies: Individual differences in prediction biases for planning future tasks |journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=41|issue=7|year=2006|pages=1359–1371|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2006.03.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intuitive prediction: Biases and corrective procedures|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a047747.pdf|date=1977|last1=Kahneman |first1=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos}} Decision Research Technical Report PTR-1042-77-6.

== Pessimism bias ==
The opposite of optimism bias is pessimism bias (or pessimistic bias), because the principles of the optimistic bias continue to be in effect in situations where individuals regard themselves as worse off than others.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt; Optimism may occur from either a distortion of personal estimates, representing personal optimism, or a distortion for others, representing personal pessimism.&lt;ref name=shepperd2002 /&gt;

'''Pessimism bias''' is an effect in which people [[exaggerate]] the likelihood that negative things will happen to them. It contrasts with optimism bias. The difference is that we are in an improbable way worried about our society's future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edelman|first=Ric|title=The Truth About Money 4th Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A3snVoXwD6oC&amp;pg=PA230|date=21 December 2010|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-207572-7|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Renewable energy sources}}
'''Osmotic power''', '''salinity gradient power''' or '''blue energy''' is the energy available from the difference in the salt concentration between [[seawater]] and [[fresh water|river water]]. Two practical methods for this are [[reverse electrodialysis]] (RED) and
[[pressure retarded osmosis]] (PRO). Both processes rely on [[osmosis]] with [[artificial membrane|membrane]]s. The key waste product is [[brackish water]]. This byproduct is the result of natural forces that are being harnessed: the flow of fresh water into seas that are made up of salt water.

In 1954, Pattle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=R.E. Pattle|title=Production of electric power by mixing fresh and salt water in the hydroelectric pile|journal=Nature|date=2 October 1954|volume=174|page=660|doi=10.1038/174660a0|issue=4431|bibcode=1954Natur.174..660P}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that there was an untapped source of power when a river mixes with the sea, in terms of the lost osmotic pressure, however it was not until the mid ‘70s where a practical method of exploiting it using selectively permeable membranes by Loeb &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=S. Loeb|title=Osmotic power plants|journal=Science|date=22 August 1975|volume=189|issue=4203|pages=654–655|doi=10.1126/science.189.4203.654|pmid=17838753|bibcode=1975Sci...189..654L}}&lt;/ref&gt; was outlined.

The method of generating power by pressure retarded osmosis was invented by Prof. [[Sidney Loeb]] in 1973 at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel.&lt;ref&gt;^ Israel Patent Application 42658 of July 3, 1973. (see also {{patent|US|3906250|title=Method and apparatus for generating power utilizing pressure-retarded-osmosis}} Erroneously shows Israel priority as 1974 instead of 1973 {{patent|US|3906250|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea came to Prof. Loeb, in part, as he observed the Jordan River flowing into the Dead Sea. He wanted to harvest the energy of mixing of the two aqueous solutions (the Jordan River being one and the Dead Sea being the other) that was going to waste in this natural mixing process.&lt;ref&gt;^ Weintraub, Bob.

The technologies have been confirmed in laboratory conditions. They are being developed into commercial use in the Netherlands (RED) and Norway (PRO). The cost of the membrane has been an obstacle. A new, lower cost membrane, based on an electrically modified [[polyethylene]] plastic, made it fit for potential commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.statkraft.com/Images/Faktaark%20OSMOTIC%20ENG_tcm4-7797.pdf History of osmotic power (PDF) at archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods have been proposed and are currently under development.

==Basics of salinity gradient power==
[[Image:Blue energy mechanism.png|thumb|right|Pressure-retarded osmosis]]
Salinity gradient power is a specific renewable energy alternative that creates renewable and sustainable power by using naturally occurring processes. This practice does not contaminate or release [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions (vapor pressure methods will release dissolved air containing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at low pressures—these non-condensable gases can be re-dissolved of course, but with an energy penalty). Also as stated by Jones and Finley within their article “Recent Development in Salinity Gradient Power”, there is basically no fuel cost.

Salinity gradient energy is based on using the resources of “osmotic pressure difference between fresh water and sea water.”&lt;ref&gt;(Jones, A.T., W. Finley. “Recent developments in salinity gradient power”. Oceans. 2003. 2284-2287.)&lt;/ref&gt; All energy that is proposed to use salinity gradient technology relies on the evaporation to separate water from salt. Osmotic pressure is the "chemical potential of concentrated and dilute solutions of salt".&lt;ref&gt;(Brauns, E. “Toward a worldwide sustainable and simultaneous large-scale production of renewable energy and potable water trough salinity gradient power by combining reversed electrodialysis and solar power?” Environmental Process and Technology. Jan 2007. 312-323.)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at relations between high osmotic pressure and low, solutions with higher concentrations of salt have higher pressure.

Differing salinity gradient power generations exist but one of the most commonly discussed is [[pressure-retarded osmosis]] (PRO). Within PRO seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber where the pressure is lower than the difference between fresh and salt water pressure. Fresh water moves in a semipermeable membrane and increases its volume in the chamber. As the pressure in the chamber is compensated a turbine spins to generate electricity. In Braun's article he states that this process is easy to understand in a more broken down manner. Two solutions, A being salt water and B being fresh water are separated by a membrane. He states "only water molecules can pass the semipermeable membrane. As a result of the osmotic pressure difference between both solutions, the water from solution B thus will diffuse through the membrane in order to dilute solution A".&lt;ref&gt;(Brauns, E. “Toward a worldwide sustainable and simultaneous large-scale production of renewable energy and potable water through salinity gradient power by combining reversed electrodialysis and solar power?.” ''Environmental Process and Technology''. Jan 2007. 312-323.)&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure drives the turbines and power the generator that produces the electrical energy. Osmosis might be used directly to "pump" fresh water out of The Netherlands into the sea. This is currently done using electric pumps.

==Efficiency==
A 2012 study on efficiency from Yale university concluded that the highest extractable work in constant-pressure PRO with a seawater draw solution and river water feed solution is 0.75 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; while the free energy of mixing is 0.81 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;—a thermodynamic extraction efficiency of 91.0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/es300060m | pmid=22463483 | volume=46 | issue=9 | title=Thermodynamic and Energy Efficiency Analysis of Power Generation from Natural Salinity Gradients by Pressure Retarded Osmosis | year=2012 | journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | pages=5230–5239 | last1 = Yin Yip | first1 = Ngai | last2 = Elimelech | first2 = Menachem| bibcode=2012EnST...46.5230Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
While the mechanics and concepts of salinity gradient power are still being studied, the power source has been implemented in several different locations. Most of these are experimental, but thus far they have been predominantly successful. The various companies that have utilized this power have also done so in many different ways as there are several concepts and processes that harness the power from salinity gradient.

===Pressure-retarded osmosis===
[[File:Simplistic pressure retarded osmosis power generation diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Simple PRO power generation scheme]]
[[File:Hurum osmosis power 02.JPG|250px|thumbnail|right|Osmotic Power Prototype at Tofte (Hurum), Norway]]
One method to utilize salinity gradient energy is called [[pressure-retarded osmosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TGK-4MDGP8H-1&amp;_user=607017&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=607017&amp;md5=acc4682fd086886dff4b0cb1ee6123df Salinity-gradient power: Evaluation of pressure-retarded osmosis and reverse electrodialysis]&lt;/ref&gt; In this method, seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber that is at a pressure lower than the difference between the pressures of saline water and fresh water. Freshwater is also pumped into the pressure chamber through a membrane, which increase both the volume and pressure of the chamber. As the pressure differences are compensated, a turbine is spun, providing kinetic energy. This method is being specifically studied by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[public utility|utility]] [[Statkraft]], which has calculated that up to 2.85 GW would be available from this process in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waderllc.com/2284-2287.pdf Recent Developments in Salinity Gradient Power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901211414/http://waderllc.com/2284-2287.pdf |date=2011-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Statkraft has built the world's first [[Statkraft osmotic power prototype in Hurum|prototype PRO power plant]] on the Oslo fjord which was opened by [[Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway|Princess Mette-Marit of Norway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/statkraft-osmotic-power/13451/ |title=The world's first osmotic power plant from Statkraft |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024125/http://www.gizmag.com/statkraft-osmotic-power/13451/ |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }} Statkraft-osmotic-power&lt;/ref&gt; on November 24, 2009. It aims to produce enough electricity to light and heat a small town within five years by osmosis. At first, it will produce a minuscule 4 kilowatts – enough to heat a large electric kettle, but by 2015 the target is 25 megawatts – the same as a small wind farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8377186.stm BBC News Norway's Statkraft opens first osmotic power plant]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 however Statkraft announced not to continue this pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forwardosmosistech.com/statkraft-discontinues-investments-in-pressure-retarded-osmosis/ |title=Is PRO economically feasible? Not according to Statkraft &amp;#124; ForwardOsmosisTech |accessdate=2017-01-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118220928/http://www.forwardosmosistech.com/statkraft-discontinues-investments-in-pressure-retarded-osmosis/ |archivedate=2017-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reversed electrodialysis===
A second method being developed and studied is [[reversed electrodialysis]] or reverse dialysis, which is essentially the creation of a salt battery. This method was described by Weinstein and Leitz as “an array of alternating anion and cation exchange membranes can be used to generate electric power from the free energy of river and sea water.”

The technology related to this type of power is still in its infant stages, even though the principle was discovered in the 1950s. Standards and a complete understanding of all the ways salinity gradients can be utilized are important goals to strive for in order make this clean energy source more viable in the future.

===Capacitive method===
A third method is [[Doriano Brogioli]]'s&lt;ref name="Brogioli" /&gt; capacitive method, which is relatively new and has so far only been tested on lab scale. With this method energy can be extracted out of the mixing of saline water and freshwater by cyclically charging up [[electrode]]s in contact with saline water, followed by a discharge in freshwater. Since the amount of electrical energy which is needed during the charging step is less than one gets out during the discharge step, each completed cycle effectively produces energy. An intuitive explanation of this effect is that the great number of [[ion]]s in the saline water efficiently neutralizes the charge on each electrode by forming a thin layer of opposite charge very close to the electrode surface, known as an [[double layer (interfacial)|electric double layer]]. Therefore, the [[voltage]] over the electrodes remains low during the charge step and charging is relatively easy. In between the charge and discharge step, the electrodes are brought in contact with freshwater. After this, there are less ions available to neutralize the charge on each electrode such that the voltage over the electrodes increases. The discharge step which follows is therefore able to deliver a relatively high amount of energy. A physical explanation is that on an electrically charged capacitor, there is a mutually attractive [[electric force]] between the [[electric charge]] on the electrode, and the ionic charge in the liquid. In order to pull ions away from the charged electrode, osmotic pressure must do [[work (physics)|work]]. This work done increases the electrical potential energy in the capacitor. An electronic explanation is that [[capacitance]] is a function of ion density. By introducing a salinity gradient and allowing some of the ions to diffuse out of the capacitor, this reduces the capacitance, and so the voltage must increase, since the voltage equals the ratio of charge to capacitance.

===Vapor pressure differences: open cycle and absorption refrigeration cycle (closed cycle)===
Both of these methods do not rely on membranes, so filtration requirements are not as important as they are in the PRO &amp; RED schemes.

====Open cycle====
Similar to the open cycle in ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC). The disadvantage of this cycle is the cumbersome problem of a large diameter turbine (75 meters +) operating at below atmospheric pressure to extract the power between the water with less salinity &amp; the water with greater salinity.

====Absorption refrigeration cycle (closed cycle)====
For the purpose of dehumidifying air, in a [[absorption refrigerator#Water spray absorption refrigeration|water-spray absorption refrigeration]] system, water vapor is dissolved into a [[deliquescent]] salt water mixture using osmotic power as an intermediary. The primary power source originates from a thermal difference, as part of a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] [[heat engine]] cycle.

===Solar pond===
At the Eddy Potash Mine in New Mexico, a technology called "salinity gradient [[solar pond]]" (SGSP) is being utilized to provide the energy needed by the mine. '''This method does not harness osmotic power''', only solar power (see: [[solar pond]]). Sunlight reaching the bottom of the saltwater pond is absorbed as heat. The effect of [[natural convection]], wherein "heat rises", is blocked using density differences between the three layers that make up the pond, in order to trap heat. The upper convection zone is the uppermost zone, followed by the stable gradient zone, then the bottom thermal zone. The stable gradient zone is the most important. The saltwater in this layer can not rise to the higher zone because the saltwater above has lower salinity and is therefore less-dense and more buoyant; and it can not sink to the lower level because that saltwater is denser. This middle zone, the stable gradient zone, effectively becomes an "insulator" for the bottom layer (although the main purpose is to block natural convection, since water is a poor insulator). This water from the lower layer, the storage zone, is pumped out and the heat is used to produce energy, usually by turbine in an [[organic Rankine cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/756432-k7Q3X9/webviewable/756432.pdf Salinity Gradient Solar Pond Technology Applied to Potash Solution Mining]&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory a solar pond ''could'' be used to generate osmotic power if evaporation from solar heat is used to create a salinity gradient, ''and'' the potential energy in this salinity gradient is ''harnessed directly'' using one of the first three methods above, such as the capacitive method.

===Boron nitride nanotubes===

A research team built an experimental system using boron nitride that produced much greater power than the Statoil prototype. It used an impermeable and electrically insulating membrane that was pierced by a single boron nitride nanotube with an external diameter of a few dozen nanometers. With this membrane separating a salt water reservoir and a fresh water reservoir, the team measured the electric current passing through the membrane using two electrodes immersed in the fluid either side of the nanotube.

The results showed the device was able to generate an electric current on the order of a nanoampere. The researchers claim this is 1,000 times the yield of other known techniques for harvesting osmotic energy and makes boron nitride nanotubes an extremely efficient solution for harvesting the energy of salinity gradients for usable electrical power.

The team claimed that a {{convert|1|m2}} membrane could generate around 4&amp;nbsp;kW and be capable of generating up to 30 MWh per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/osmotic-salinity-gradient-power-nanotubes/26623/ |title=Nanotubes boost potential of salinity power as a renewable energy source |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028032447/http://www.gizmag.com/osmotic-salinity-gradient-power-nanotubes/26623/ |archivedate=2013-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Using low caloric waste energy by regenerate a high solution ammonium bicarbonate in a solution with a low salinity===
At Pennsylvania State University, Dr. Logan tries to use waste heat with low calority using the fact that [[ammonium bicarbonate]] disappears into NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in warm water to form ammonia bicarbonate again in cold water. So in a RED energy producing closed system the two different gradients of salinity are kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.psu.edu/energyfromwater/ |title=Energy from Water |accessdate=2017-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202195525/http://sites.psu.edu/energyfromwater/ |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible negative environmental impact==

Marine and river environments have obvious differences in water quality, namely salinity. Each species of aquatic plant and animal is adapted to survive in either marine, brackish, or freshwater environments. There are species that can tolerate both, but these species usually thrive best in a specific water environment. The main waste product of salinity gradient technology is brackish water. The discharge of brackish water into the surrounding waters, if done in large quantities and with any regularity, will cause salinity fluctuations. While some variation in salinity is usual, particularly where fresh water (rivers) empties into an ocean or sea anyway, these variations become less important for both bodies of water with the addition of brackish waste waters. Extreme salinity changes in an aquatic environment may result in findings of low densities of both animals and plants due to intolerance of sudden severe salinity drops or spikes.&lt;ref name=Montague&gt;Montague, C., Ley, J. A Possible Effect of Salinity Fluctuation on Abundance of Benthic Vegetation and Associated Fauna in Northeastern Florida Bay. Estuaries and Coasts. 1993. Springer New York. Vol.15 No. 4. Pg. 703-717&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prevailing environmentalist opinions, the possibility of these negative effects should be considered by the operators of future large blue energy establishments.

The impact of brackish water on ecosystems can be minimized by pumping it out to sea and releasing it into the mid-layer, away from the surface and bottom ecosystems.

Impingement and entrainment at intake structures are a concern due to large volumes of both river and sea water utilized in both PRO and RED schemes. Intake construction permits must meet strict environmental regulations and desalination plants and power plants that utilize surface water are sometimes involved with various local, state and federal agencies to obtain permission that can take upwards to 18 months.

'''Parataxic distortion''' is a [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] term first used by [[Harry Stack Sullivan|Harry S. Sullivan]] to describe the inclination to skew [[perception]]s of others based on [[fantasy]]. The "distortion" is a faulty perception of others, based not on actual experience with the other individual, but on a projected fantasy [[wikt:personality|personality]] attributed to the individual. For example, when one falls in love, an image of another person as the “perfect match” or “soul mate” can be created when in reality, the other person may not live up to these expectations or embody the imagined traits at all. 

The fantasy personality is created in part from past experiences and from expectations as to how the person 'should be', and is formulated in response to [[emotional stress]]. This stress can originate from the formation of a new relationship, or from [[cognitive dissonance]] required to maintain an existing relationship. Parataxic distortion serves as an immature cognitive [[defense mechanism]] against this psychological stress and is similar to [[Transference]].

Parataxic distortion is difficult to avoid because of the nature of human learning and interaction. Stereotyping of individuals based on social cues and the classification of people into groups is a commonplace cognitive function of the human mind. Such [[pigeonholing]] allows for a person to gain a quick, though possibly inaccurate, assessment of an interaction. The cognitive processes employed, however, can have a distorting effect on the clear understanding of individuals. In essence, one can lose the ability to 'hear the other' through one's own projected beliefs of what the other person is saying.

==Etymology==
From the Greek παράταξις, "placement side by side" 

Para - A Greek prefix which came to designate objects or activities auxiliary to or derivative of that denoted by the base word ( parody; paronomasia, paranoia) and hence abnormal or defective.
 
Taxic - indicating movement towards or away from a specified stimulus.

In this sense, Parataxic distortion, is a shift in perception away from reality.
	
==Interpersonal relationships and emotions==

Distorting one's perception of others can often interfere with interpersonal relationships. In many cases, however, it may be beneficial to do so. Humans are constantly and subconsciously stereotyping. According to Paul Martin Lester, "our brains naturally classify what we see, we can't help but notice the differences in physical attributes between one person and another."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://paulmartinlester.info/writings/stereotype.html|title=PICTORIAL STEREOTYPES IN THE MEDIA|website=paulmartinlester.info|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parataxic distortion runs parallel to stereotyping while it remains in the subconscious. As we make quick judgments, we are drawing from previous experiences stored in our memory.

Parataxic distortion can be a beneficial defense mechanism for the individual, allowing the individual to maintain relationships with others with whom he or she would otherwise be unable to interact or allowing the individual to endure difficult periods in relationships. A self-imposed blindness to certain personality traits can keep a relationship healthy, or it can also prove destructive. For instance, parataxic distortion can keep one in denial of the abusive nature of a spouse.

==Attachment theory==

Parataxic distortion can begin in the early stages of development in [[infants]]. A mother’s nurturing personality and emotional warmth might be projected onto a lover later in life. This could initially generate stronger feelings for the woman than are warranted by her behavior and character alone. This example of [[attachment theory]] correlates with Parataxic Distortion.

Attachment theory would have it that the fantasy selves projected onto others in parataxic distortion are informed by our long-term attachment patterns. Not only are these imagined traits the resultant of our earliest bonds and unresolved emotional issues from past relationships, but they are recreated in these fantasy selves for the purpose of recreating that past attachment in the present.

==Negative effects==
Dealing with current situations or people that relate to a past event, or remind someone of a person from the past, can have negative effects on a human from an emotional standpoint. If the person from the past was a negative figure or the past event had a negative influence on a person, the person may create a self-sense of identity for the new individual they met. The negative emotional response happens when the individual realizes that they have been creating a fake identity for the new individual. 

Parataxic distortion is most effective in the realm of interpersonal communication. Parataxic distortion is typically used to avoid coping with past events. For example, if a child is mistreated by his or her father, the child may not only attach the fear and anger towards the father but will also relate this fear and anger to other men that look, talk or act like the father. The human mind keeps track of situations that we have encountered in the past to help us deal with future situations. The unconscious memory, without our knowing, helps us understand and deal with situations in the present that we have dealt with in the past. Parataxic distortion and our unconscious mind make us act the same way in current situations as we did in the past, even without realizing it.

==Defense mechanism==

As a [[Defence mechanisms|defense mechanism]], parataxic distortion protects one from the emotional consequences of a past event. A person may not remember a certain event, or be acting on it consciously, but will act a certain way to protect themselves from an outcome with the use of parataxic distortion. This behavior is a pathological attempt to cope with reality by using unreality.

Parataxic distortion is a commonly used psychological defense mechanism. It is not an illness or a disease, but a part of everyday, normal human psychology that can become maladaptive in certain situations. The cognitive abilities used to generate internal models of others are useful in interaction. As we can never truly internalize the full reality of another, we must interact with a shorthand version of them. It's only when we believe that the shorthand version is their reality that this ability can become maladaptive. One may also attempt to coerce or force another to 'fit the mold' and act more according to expectations, more like the idealized version they dream the other as being. This is also pathological. 

However, all humans engage in parataxic distortion to one extent or another, in one realm or another. It may be to manage emotions within their family, to facilitate communication between them and their spouse, or to imagine a relationship between them and their nation-state.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34175">{{short description|A social network game played on a two-dimensional matrix}}
The '''Poietic Generator''' is a [[social-network game]] designed by [[Olivier Auber]]&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Auber, independent researcher, member dof the research cluster of the [http://p2pfoundation.net P2P foundation], affiliated since 2012 to the interdisciplinary research group [http://ecco.vub.ac.be/?q=node/30 "Evolution, Complexity and COgnition" (ECCO), Vrije Universiteit Brussel] and to the [http://globalbraininstitute.org Global Brain Institute].&lt;/ref&gt; in 1986, and developed from 1987 under the label [[free art]]&lt;ref&gt;Prior the free art license (2000), the Poietic Generator had its own free license: https://web.archive.org/web/20020605145918/http://perso.enst.fr/~auber/sommaireA.html#statut.&lt;/ref&gt; thanks to many contributors.&lt;ref&gt;Poietic Generator's contributors : http://poietic-generator.net/blog/?page_id=91.&lt;/ref&gt; The game takes place within a two-dimensional matrix in the tradition of [[board games]] and its principle is similar to both [[Conway's Game of Life]] and the [[Surrealism|surrealists]]' [[Exquisite corpse]].

However, it differs from these models in several respects. It is not an algorithm like Conway's, but human players who control in real time the graphic elements of a global matrix, on the basis of one unit per person. Unlike the exquisite corpse, in which there are always hidden parts, here all the players' actions are visible at all times by each of them. Unlike [[board games]], there is no concept of winning or losing, the goal of the game is simply to collectively draw recognizable forms and to observe how we create them together.

The name "Poietic Generator", derived from the concept of [[autopoiesis]] in life sciences ([[Francisco Varela]]), and of [[poietic]] in philosophy of art ([[Paul Valéry]], [[:fr:René Passeron|René Passeron]] {{fr}}), illustrates the process of [[self-organization]] at work in the continuous emergence of the global picture. Since its inception, the Poietic Generator has been designed as part of a wider [[action research]] to create an "Art of Speed".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://nideffer.net/proj/_SPEED_/1.4/articles/auber.html Esquisse d'une position théorique pour un art de la vitesse]'', Olivier Auber, SPEED 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules of the game ==
&lt;blockquote&gt; Every player draws on a small part of a global mosaic formed by the dynamic juxtaposition of those parts, which are manipulated by all the participants (eventually it will be possible for several thousand players to play simultaneously). Every player can therefore change the sign in his/her square, depending on the overall state of the image, which itself depends on the actions of all the individual players. Out of this cybernetic loop emerges a kind of narrative: autonomous forms, sometimes abstract, sometimes figurative, appear in a completely unpredictable manner and tell stories.&lt;ref name="Olivier Auber"&gt;Olivier Auber, in [http://www.kisskissbankbank.com/fr/projects/generateur-poietique/news/poietic-generator-reloaded-l-aventure-peut-re-commencer ''Poietic Generator reloaded, l'aventure peut (re)commencer !'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In practice, each player can draw (using a graphics tablet) on a very simple image. This image is limited in size (20×20 [[pixels]]) by design. This was done to prevent a single player from drawing figurative signs by himself. The overall image is continuously formed in the style of a spiral, that is to say the sign of the first player occupies the whole image, and the signs of the newcomers are juxtaposed in the first winding around it, and so on. If a player forfeits the game, his/her sign immediately disappears and its position remains empty until another player occupies it. A zoom in/zoom out feature ensures that the image constituted by the juxtaposition of all signs, is permanently visible to all the players.

== Versions ==
The Poietic Generator runs on two types of architecture, a centralized network (for versions 1, 3, 4), or an ''[[Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector|ad hoc]]'' distributed network capable of implementing the [[multicast]] protocol (case version 2). Therefore, no location in the network plays a particular role and according to the rules of the Poietic Generator, an "all-all" interaction may take place without the intervention of any kind of control center.

== Experiments ==
Since 1987, the Poietic Generator (various versions) inspired many experiments in diverse contexts. The first public experiment was at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in 1990 as part of the "Communication and monumentality" exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;The exhibition "Communication and monumentality" ([[Centre Georges Pompidou]], 1990) presented the seven laureates of the ''France-Japon Symbol'' contest launched by [[:fr:Philippe Quéau|Philippe Quéau]]. The Poietic Generator was one of them: [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1510/is_n62/ai_7422483/ Charles Lenay "The poietic generator - interactive telecommunication artwork".

Several experiments were performed on the periphery of academic research. For instance, experiments were conducted in particular at [[Telecom ParisTech]] (where Olivier Auber was a guest artist between 1994 and 1997), during the Internet [[Mbone]] experiment (with [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] and Xerox PARC), and at other laboratories. The subjects of the experiments were diverse: network protocols, the process of emergence of forms, human-machine interfaces, collective intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;''ProspecTic, nouvelles technologies, nouvelles pensées'', Jean-Michel Cornu, FING &amp; Fyp Editions, oct. 2008. ([http://perspective-numerique.net/wakka.php?wiki=ProspecTic Web])&lt;/ref&gt; group behavior,&lt;ref&gt;Elisa Giaccardi, Center for LifeLong Learning and Design (L3D), Department of Computer Science and Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Colorado : ''Mediators in Visual Interaction: An Analysis of the “Poietic Generator” and “Open Studio”'' ([http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/~giaccard/research/pdf/Giaccardi_JVLC05.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

Since 1997, the Poietic Generator is accessible to everyone on the web as a work of [[free art]] (under [[Free Art License]] from 2002). At the request of various groups of artists, teachers or researchers, this led to several hundred recorded&lt;ref&gt;Some records: [http://perspective-numerique.net/wakka.php?wiki=GenerateurPoietiqueVideos (perspective-numerique.net)]&lt;/ref&gt; game sessions, some of them commented.&lt;ref&gt;Some comments: [http://www.transactiv-exe.org/spip.php?article98 (Transactiv.exe)]&lt;/ref&gt; In several of these sessions, 70 players participated simultaneously. Several experiments were in kindergarten, elementary and secondary schools (including one experiment linking multiple classrooms).

The most recent event was in the spring of 2011 when 70 people responded to a call on the  [[France Culture]] radio station&lt;ref&gt;France-Culture, [http://www.franceculture.fr/emission-place-de-la-toile-agriculture-machines-et-reseaux-generateur-poietique-2011-04-10.html ''Place de la Toile'', 2011.04.10] ([http://perspective-numerique.net/wakka.php?wiki=PlaceDeLaToile10042011 Audio])&lt;/ref&gt; to finance the mobile version of the Poietic Generator via the crowd-funded platform&lt;ref&gt;.

Note that the Poietic Generator was born at the time of [[Minitel]], before the invention of the Web (1994), and implemented from 1995 onwards on experimental [[Multicast]] networks foreshadowing [[IPv6]]. The introduction of the Minitel in France, offered, for the first time in the world, an easy way to implement [[telematic art]]. Several French artists attempted somewhat similar experiments,&lt;ref&gt;Example of [[telematic art]] using [[Minitel]] : ''Image-la-Vallée'', vitrail monumental dessiné collectivement par minitel, (Jean-Claude Anglade) 1987. ([http://jean.claude.anglade.free.fr/ Web])&lt;/ref&gt; but none of them had the durability of Poietic Generator.

[[:fr:Anne Cauquelin|Anne Cauquelin]], who deals with the mechanisms of the "system of art" in several of her works,&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Anne Cauquelin|Anne Cauquelin]]: ''Fréquenter les incorporels'', PUF, collection « Lignes d'art », 2006. ''Que sais-je ? L’art contemporain'', PUF, 9eme édition, mai 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; considers the Poietic Generator to be the prototype of a new "cognitive art". This new "cognitive art", following [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Andy Warhol]], re-institutes the task of questioning again, and in a more radical way, the "[[doxa]] of art".
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like in the Renaissance, art becomes (a) heuristic, a type of probe with the task to explore a continent.&lt;ref name="Anne Cauquelin"&gt;[[:fr:Anne Cauquelin|Anne Cauquelin]], à propros of  "cognitive art" in ''L'art contemporain'', PUF (2009), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since 1987, the Poietic Generator directly inspired multiple variations and derivative works. Some of them developed by its original author&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Auber, derivative works of the Poietic Generator: ''[http://wiki.km2.net/wakka.php?wiki=FranceJaponReseau L'Anneau France-Japon, 1988]'' (lauréat du concours du symbole France-Japon, Paris-Kobé, 1988), ''[http://wiki.km2.net/wakka.php?wiki=Schatz Le Trésor des Nibelungen, 2001]'' ([http://km2.net/aplush/nibelungenmuseum/presse/BostonGlobe/BostonGlobe.htm Boston CyberArt 2001], [http://www.liberation.fr/guide/0101356321-tragedies-en-sous-sol ISEA 2001], [http://km2.net/aplush/nibelungenmuseum/communique/sommaire.htm NibelungenMuseum, Worms 2001]), ''[http://arbe.km2.net @rbre (open collective memory), 2000]'' ([http://www.francegenweb.org/blog/index.php?post/2006/05/13/138-l-rbre-un-nouvelle-representation-graphique-de-la-genealogie Tourouvre 2006, Québec 2008]), ''[http://wiki.km2.net/wakka.php?wiki=InvisibleMonument L’Invisible Monument, 2002]'' ([http://km2.net/IMG/jpg/libe10-05-2003-.jpg Metz, 2003])&lt;/ref&gt; based on his own research process,&lt;ref&gt;Elen S.

[http://www.dfki.de/LAMDa/2012/accepted/PolySocial_Reality.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Indirectly, the Poietic Generator probably inspired many other artists and designers too.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of recent works using some Poietic Generator's principles: [http://www.cinematrix.com/games.html Cinematrix] ([[Loren Carpenter]], SIGGRAH, 2006), [https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_visualizing Bar chart for words] ([[Martin M.

== Theoretical aspects ==

=== Modelling ===
Jean-Paul Fourmentraux, in his classification&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Fourmentraux, ''[http://tc.revues.org/2872 Les Dispositifs du Net Art]'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Net.art]] devices, quotes the Poietic Generator as one of the few representatives of the "alteraction" devices category. These type of devices support processes of pure synchronous human communication, free from algorithmic control or introduction of external data. This alteraction process, envisioned as "an intermediate action which makes one become other"&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Philippe Quéau|Philippe Quéau]] : ''Metaxu : théorie de l'art intermédiaire'', Editions Champ Vallon, 1989 - 337 pages&lt;/ref&gt; ([[:fr:Philippe Quéau|Philippe Quéau]]), lies outside the field studied by the general [[theory of games]], as its branch covering multiplayer games ([[coordination game]]s, [[cooperative game]]s) which does not consider the [[emergence]] of meta-levels: specifically the "becoming other". According to testimony, the Poietic Generator has an amazing ability to immerse its players in a learning process of social phenomena: it gives not only the possibility to live a kind of "conversation", but in some degree, to access to its model by observing and interpreting autopoietic phenomena, that is to say the "life", which takes place there. According to Olivier Auber, there would be in the Poietic Generator, intrusion of eigenfrequencies, similar to those existing in other autopoietic systems (cell, cerebral cortex, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Jean Petitot, [http://jean.petitot.pagesperso-orange.fr/JPmodeles.html ''Modèles dynamiques en Sciences cognitives'']&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their apparent complexity, these temporal phenomena (oscillations between structure and chaos, complexity and simplicity) could be analyzed, even "mathematised",&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Auber : [http://perspective-numerique.net/PDF/RecherchePerspectivesAnoptiques.pdf ''Perspectives anoptiques : théorie et applications'' PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the light of the [[simplicity theory]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simplicitytheory.org/ ''simplicity theory'' ([[Jean-Louis Dessalles]], Telecom Paristech, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08657 Saillenfest, A., Dessalles, J-L., Auber, O. (2016). Role of Simplicity in Creative Behaviour: The Case of the Poietic Generator. Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC-2016). Paris, France. (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Jean-Louis Dessalles]]). Structuring phases corresponds to a "becoming other" (Quéau) and a greater "simplicity" (Dessalles). The emergence of these kinds of paradigm shifts would be both unexpected and [[determinism|deterministic]].

=== Perspectives ===
The Poietic Generator may be seen as a generic model&lt;ref&gt;Lenay, C. (1988): ''Création collective et émergence de signes : l'oeuvre d'Olivier Auber'', published in  Actes du séminaire interdisciplinaire de Sciences Cognitives et Epistémologie "Genèse des Représentations" - 01/1995 - p. 139-148, online on [https://www.academia.edu/31940266/Cr%C3%A9ation_collective_et_%C3%A9mergence_de_signes Academia]&lt;/ref&gt; of multiple complex systems (informational, urban, economic, ecological, etc.) to which everyone is confronted daily. But unlike these systems, often opaque about their prerequisites, their rules and infrastructure, the Poietic Generator is perfectly transparent: "everything is known or knowable",&lt;ref name="Olivier Auber"/&gt; in particular the fact that it operates either centrally or without any center. According to Olivier Auber,&lt;ref&gt;As discussed by Inge Hinterwaldner in ''The Systemic Image: A New Theory of Interactive Real-Time Simulations'', MIT Press (2016) - p. 28, 29, 283, 326, 327, 386. Available on [https://books.google.com/books?id=XT3mDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA326&amp;lpg=PA326&amp;dq=%22Du+%22g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rateur+po%C3%AF%C3%A9tique%22+%C3%A0+la+perspective+num%C3%A9rique%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=luXR2A3N6V&amp;sig=dFahWS0MJh1kq9-vlh4UjZ7zSek&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Auber&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; these two architectures, centered or not, are achieving some forms of "[[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]" (within the meaning of the Renaissance) in which the vanishing point lies, in the first case, in a physical center (the server), in the second in a "code" under cover of which the network is sharing information (its sign of recognition in some way). He speaks in the first case of a "temporal perspective" because it is in the center where emerges moment by moment the "proper time" of the network (its rhythmic pulsations). In the second case, he speaks of a "digital perspective"&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Auber : ''Du Générateur poïétique à la perspective numérique'', Revue d'esthétique 43 - 07/2003 - p. 127, online on [http://archee.qc.ca/ar.php?page=imp&amp;no=207 Archée, Québec], "The Aestetic of the Digital Perspective", Artmedia VIII,
Paris, 2002 ([http://vv.arts.ucla.edu/publications/publications/02-03/Artmedia/PARTICIPANTSe.htm arts.ucla.edu])&lt;/ref&gt;  because it is a "code" (an arbitrary number) which is the guarantor of the emergence of the proper time of the network in each of its nodes. These two perspectives are of course not visual as is the case of the spatial perspective, but they share with it some topological and symbolic attributes. In particular, one can speak of "legitimate perspective", as [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] did in the [[Renaissance]]. The Poietic Generator as an [[Ideal city]], implements these two non-visual perspectives, described by Oliver Auber "anoptical perspectives," as perfectly and obvious as possible. Throughout the game, players can gradually take a cognitive step back, and by analogy grasp in thought the nature of the perspectives in question. The hypothesis of Olivier Auber is that these perspectives are exercised within the framework of "real" systems, opaque and complex as mentioned above, and that they shape the imagination and judgment, that is to say the [[doxa]] of those who are enrolled in it.

In attempting to uncover the "anoptical perspectives", the Poietic Generator positions itself as a [[metagaming|metagame]] which invites a questioning of the processes of social interaction, especially when they are mediated by technological devices interacting with [[social networks]].&lt;ref&gt;De nouvelles perspectives pour les « réseaux sociaux ?», conférence dans les cadre des « Entretiens du nouveau monde industriel », Centre Georges Pompidou, 4 octobre 2008 ([http://amateur.iri.centrepompidou.fr/nouveaumonde/enmi/ldt/index/xolivierauber vidéo])&lt;/ref&gt; For Olivier Auber, the Poietic Generator, as a model and experience available to all, could contribute to "a certain conceptual knowledge (dianoia) of how the doxa is formed and exercised on us, especially through technology". At a time when technical objects are close to the body and are preparing to invade it, the Poietic Generator could help us by providing "a set of conceptual tools for the new "perspecteurs" ([[Abraham Bosse]]) that we could all become" in order, he says, to "rethink the imagination of the technology in full light".&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Auber : Perspectives anoptiques : théorie et applications, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception by the institutions of research, culture and media ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;Attempts like this are crucial to emancipate the technology from the status a mere instrument for defined purposes, and to recognize the role that it should have as a creator of culture and practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isabelle Stengers]], [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/stengers.gif lettre de soutien, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Since the 1990s, many scientists in all disciplines, mentioned the Poietic Generator as a model which may help to rethink the cultural, even anthropological changing, latent in networks, and especially emphasized the urgency of a "redefinition of the notion of authorship".&lt;ref&gt;Anne Sauvageot et Michel Léglise, ''Culture visuelle et art collectif sur le web'' (PDF)], rapport au Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication, 1999 ([http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/rapports/sauvageot-leglise/art_col_web.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these researchers&lt;ref&gt;Some scientists supporting the Poietic Generator : [[Francisco Varela]] (biology) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/varela.gif lettre], [[Paul Virilio]] (urbanism and philosophy) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/virilio.gif lettre], [[Isabelle Stengers]] (history of science) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/stengers.gif lettre], [[Bernard Stiegler]] (philosophy) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/stiegler.gif lettre], [[:fr:Jean-Pierre Dupuy|Jean-Pierre Dupuy]] (philosophy) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/dupuy.gif lettre], [[w:en:Roy ascott|Roy Ascott]] (digital arts) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/ascott.gif lettre], [[Fred Forest]] (media art) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/forest.gif lettre], [[:fr:Jean-Pierre Le Goff (historian)|Jean-Pierre Le Goff]] (history of science)- [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/legoff.gif lettre], [[Pierre Lévy]] (cognitive sciences) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/levy.gif lettre], [http://cricc.univ-paris1.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=18 Isabelle Rieusset-Lemarié] (humanities) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/rieusset.gif lettre], [http://www.ehess.fr/fr/enseignement/enseignements/2012/enseignant/307/ Michel Tibon-Cornillot] (history of sciences), [http://liris.cnrs.fr/enaction/docs/fiches2008/CharlesLenay.html Charles Lenay] (history of sciences) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/lenay.gif lettre], [[:fr:René Passeron|René Passeron]] (esthetics) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/passeron.gif lettre], [http://chavalarias.com/tiki-index.php?page=Louis+Bec+%3A+L%27art+est+le+vivant&amp;bl=y Louis Bec] (artificial life) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/bec.gif lettre], [http://www.cnrs.fr/cw/dossiers/dosrob/accueil/laboratoires/labo/tuteur.html Philippe Coiffet] (robotics) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/coiffet.gif lettre], [http://www.twobirds.com/French/Lawyers/Pages/Pierre_Sirinelli1.aspx Pierre Sirinelli] (law) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/siri.gif lettre], [http://www.sgdl.org/toutes-les-actualites/718-notice-biographique-de-sandra-travers-de-faultrier Sandra Travers de Faultrier] (law) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/faultrier.gif lettre], [http://www.lactamme.polytechnique.fr/ Jean-François Colonna] (mathematics) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/colonna.gif lettre]&lt;/ref&gt; brought in a personal support to attempts to practice large-scale experiments using channels such as broadcast television stations, museums, public places, etc. Without listening and support from these institutional broadcasters,&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Auber : 'Grandeur et déchéance programmée de l'art numérique en France'' 2011 ([http://perspective-numerique.net/wakka.php?wiki=GrandeurEtDecheanceProgrammee Web])&lt;/ref&gt; very few of these projects have been successful. Handicapped by its transdisciplinary or even "undisciplinary" nature, and naturally questioning the legitimacy of human organizations to which it is dealing with, the [[action research]] on the Poietic Generator has never found any other field to flourish as the Internet itself. Nevertheless, the Poietic Generator and writings of its author are quoted in many academic thesis,&lt;ref&gt;''Le copyleft appliqué à la création hors logiciel.

The '''problem of other minds''' is a philosophical problem traditionally stated as the following [[Epistemology|epistemological]] challenge raised by the [[Skepticism|skeptic]]: given that I can only observe the [[behavior]] of others, how can I know that others have [[mind]]s?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/other-minds/|first=Alec|last=Hyslop|title=Other Minds|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.|editor2-last=Nodelman|editor2-first=Uri|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University|issn=1095-5054|date=14 January 2014|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a central tenet of the philosophical idea known as [[solipsism]]; the notion that for any person only one's own mind is known to exist. Solipsism maintains that no matter how sophisticated someone's behavior is, behavior on its own does not guarantee the presence of mentality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7135">Rna22 is a pattern-based algorithm for the discovery of [[microRNA]] target sites and the corresponding heteroduplexes.&lt;ref name="pmid16990141"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miranda KC, Huynh T, Tay Y, Ang YS, Tam WL, Thomson AM, Lim B, Rigoutsos I |title=A pattern-based method for the identification of MicroRNA binding sites and their corresponding heteroduplexes. |journal=Cell |volume=126 |issue=6 |pages=1203–17 |year=2006 |pmid=16990141 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The algorithm is conceptually distinct from other methods for predicting [[List of RNA structure prediction software#Inter molecular interactions: MicroRNA:UTR|microRNA:mRNA heteroduplexes]] in that it does ''not'' use experimentally validated heteroduplexes for training, instead relying only on the sequences of
known mature miRNAs that are found in the public databases. The key idea of rna22 is that the reverse complement of any salient sequence features that one can identify in mature microRNA sequences (using pattern discovery techniques) should allow one to identify candidate microRNA target sites in a sequence of interest: rna22 makes use of the [[Teiresias algorithm]] to discover such salient features. Once a candidate microRNA target site has been located, the targeting microRNA can be identified with the help of any of several algorithms able to compute RNA:RNA heteroduplexes. A new version (v2.0) of the algorithm is now available: v2.0-beta adds probability estimates to each prediction, gives users the ability to choose the sensitivity/specificity settings on-the-fly, is significantly faster than the original, and can be accessed through http://cm.jefferson.edu/rna22/Interactive/.

Rna22 neither relies on nor imposes any cross-organism conservation constraints to filter out unlikely candidates; this gives it the ability to discover microRNA binding sites that may not be conserved in phylogenetically proximal organisms. Also, as mentioned above, rna22 can identify putative microRNA binding sites without needing to know the identity of the targeting microRNA. A notable property of rna22 is that it does ''not'' require the presence of the exact reverse complement of a microRNA's seed in a putative target permitting bulges and G:U wobbles in the seed region of the heteroduplex. Lastly, the algorithm has been shown to achieve high signal-to-noise ratio.&lt;ref name="pmid19478799"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ritchie W, Flamant S, Rasko JE |title=Predicting microRNA targets and functions: traps for the unwary. |journal=Nature Methods |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=397–8 |year=2009 |pmid=19478799 |doi=10.1038/nmeth0609-397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of rna22 led to the discovery of "non-canonical" microRNA targets in the coding regions of the mouse ''Nanog'', ''Oct4'' and ''Sox2''.&lt;ref name="pmid18806776"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tay Y, Zhang J, Thomson AM, Lim B, Rigoutsos I |title=MicroRNAs to ''Nanog'', ''Oct4'' and ''Sox2'' coding regions modulate embryonic stem cell differentiation. |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7126 |pages=1124–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18806776 | doi=10.1038/nature07299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these targets are not conserved in the human orthologues of these three transcription factors even though they reside in the coding region of the corresponding mRNAs. Moreover, most of these targets contain G:U wobbles, one or more bulges, or both, in the seed region of the heteroduplex. In addition to coding regions, rna22 has helped discover non-canonical targets in 3'UTRs.&lt;ref name="pmid19748357"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lal A, Navarro F, Maher CA, Maliszewski LE, Yan N, O'Day E, Chowdhury D, Dykxhoorn DM, Tsai P, Hofmann O, Becker KG, Gorospe M, Hide W, Lieberman J |title=miR-24 inhibits cell proliferation by targeting E2F2, MYC, and other cell-cycle genes via binding to "seedless" 3'UTR microRNA recognition elements. |journal=Mol Cell |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=610–25 |year=2009 |pmid=19748357 | doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2009.08.020 |pmc=2757794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study&lt;ref name="srep00569"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Xia Z, Clark P, Huynh T, Loher P, Zhao Y, Chen HW, Rigoutsos I, Zhou R |title=Molecular dynamics simulations of Ago silencing complexes reveal a large repertoire of admissible 'seed-less' targets. |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=2 |year=2012 |doi=10.1038/srep00569 |pmid=22888400 |pmc=3415692}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the problem of non-canonical miRNA targets using molecular dynamics simulations of the crystal structure of the Argonaute-miRNA:mRNA ternary complex. The study found that several kinds of modifications, including combinations of multiple G:U wobbles and mismatches in the seed region, are admissible and result in only minor structural fluctuations that do not affect the stability of the ternary complex. The study also showed that the findings of the molecular dynamics simulation are supported by [[HITS-CLIP]] (CLIP-seq) data. These results suggest that ''bona fide'' miRNA targets transcend the canonical seed-model in turn making target prediction tools like rna22 an ideal choice for exploring the newly augmented spectrum of miRNA targets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3909">'''Repetition blindness''' ('''RB''') is a phenomenon observed in [[rapid serial visual presentation]]. People are sometimes poor at recognizing when things happen twice. Repetition blindness is the failure to recognize a second happening of a visual display. The two displays are shortly shown usually for about 150 milliseconds, and then they are shown within 500 milliseconds of each other (Kanwisher, 1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanwisher|first=N|title=Repetition blindness: Type recognition without token individuation|journal=Cognition|year=1987|volume=27|pages=117–143|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90016-3|pmid=3691023}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Repetition blindness tasks usually are words in lists and in sentences. They are called phonologically similar items (Bavelier &amp; Potter, 1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bavelier|first=D|author2=Potter, M |title=Visual and phonological codes in repetition blindness|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also pictures, and words that include pictures. An example of this is a picture of the sun and the word sun (Bavelier, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bavelier|first=D|title=Repetition blindness between visually different items: The case of pictures and words|journal=Cognition|year=1994|issue=3|pages=199–236|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(94)90054-x|volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most popular task used to examine repetition blindness is to show words one after another on a screen fast in which participants must recall the words that they saw. This task is known as the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). Repetition blindness is present if missing the second word creates an inaccurate sentence. An example of this is "When she spilled the ink there was ink all over.” An RSVP sequence participants will recall seeing "When she spilled the ink there was all over." However, they are missing the second occurrence of "ink" (Kanwisher, 1987). This finding supports that people are "blind" for the second occurrence of a repetitive item in an RSVP series.  
For example, a subject's chances of correctly reporting both appearances of the word "cat" in the RSVP stream "dog mouse cat elephant cat snake" are lower than their chances of reporting the third and fifth words in the stream "dog mouse cat elephant pig snake".

The precise mechanism underlying RB has been extensively debated. [[Nancy Kanwisher]] has argued that it involves failure to [[tokenize]] the second appearance of a repeated stimulus, leading to the second appearance being dropped from short term memory before it can be reported.  However, Whittlesea and colleagues have argued that repetition blindness arises from a failure to properly reconstruct the list, both online and post list.  This failure to properly reconstruct the list arises from the poor encoding cues that are the result of the RSVP task.

{{Platonism}}
The '''Ship of State''' is a famous and oft-cited [[metaphor]] put forth by [[Plato]] in Book VI of the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (488a–489d).  It likens the [[governance]] of a [[city-state]] to the command of a naval vessel and ultimately argues that the only men fit to be [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] of this [[ship]] ({{lang-grc-gre|ναῦς}}) are [[philosopher king]]s, benevolent men with absolute power who have access to [[the Form of the Good]]. The origins of the metaphor can be traced back to the lyric poet [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] (frs. 6, 208, 249), and it is found in [[Sophocles]]’ [[Antigone]] and [[Aeschylus]]' [[Seven Against Thebes]] before Plato.

==Plato's use of the metaphor==
Plato establishes the comparison by saying that [[God]] was one of the best models of describing the steering of a ship as just like any other "craft" or [[profession]] — in particular, that of a [[Politician|statesman]].  He then runs the metaphor in reference to a particular type of government: [[democracy]].  Plato’s democracy is not the modern notion of a mix of democracy and [[republic]]anism, but rather direct democracy by way of pure majority rule.  In the metaphor, found at 488a-489d, Plato's Socrates compares the population at large to a strong but nearsighted shipowner whose knowledge of seafaring is lacking. The quarreling sailors are demagogues and politicians, and the ship's navigator, a stargazer, is the philosopher. The sailors flatter themselves with claims to knowledge of sailing, though they know nothing of navigation, and are constantly vying with one another for the approval of the shipowner so to captain the ship, going so far as to stupefy the shipowner with drugs and wine. Meanwhile, they dismiss the navigator as a useless stargazer, though he is the only one with adequate knowledge to direct the ship's course.

==The Ship of State since Plato==
It has been routinely referenced throughout [[Western culture]] ever since its inception; two notable literary examples are [[Horace|Horace's]] [[Odes (Horace)|ode]] 1.14 and "[[O Ship of State]]" by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]. [[Roger Williams]], the founder of Rhode Island, used the metaphor in his Letter to the Town of Providence (1656).

More recently, it has become a staple of American political discussion, where it is viewed simply as its image of the state as a ship, in need of a government as officers to command it – and conspicuously absent of its anti-democratic, pro-[[Autocracy|absolutist]] original meaning.

The term has entered popular culture as well. [[Leonard cohen|Leonard Cohen]]'s song "Democracy" contains the line "Sail on. Sail on, o mighty ship of state. To the shores of need, past the reefs of greed, through the squalls of hate." Also, in his second novel 'Beautiful Losers' (1966) Cohen writes "Sail on, sail on, O Ship of State, auto accidents, births, Berlin, cures for cancer!" (p.&amp;nbsp;12). In the British TV series [[Yes, Minister]], [[Sir Humphrey|Sir Humphrey Appleby]] pointed out that "the Ship of State is the only ship that leaks from the top".&lt;ref&gt;Season 3, episode 5 ("The Bed of Nails") at ca 25:33 mins&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actual ocean liners===
Beyond the political metaphor, in the 20th century "Ship of State" became a term applied to [[ocean liner]]s which were built to be floating symbols of a state's artistic and technological advancement; normally [[flagship]]s of the country's most successful passenger shipping line, and the construction of which was often subsidised by the state government.  Examples of liners considered Ships of State are the [[RMS Queen Mary|RMS ''Queen Mary'']] ([[United Kingdom]]), [[SS Normandie|SS ''Normandie'']] ([[France]]), [[SS Rex|SS ''Rex'']] ([[Italy]]), [[SS France (1961)|SS ''France'']] (France), [[RMS Queen Mary 2|RMS ''Queen Mary 2'']] (United Kingdom), and [[SS United States|SS ''United States'']] ([[United States]]).

[[Image:Snoezelruimte.JPG|thumb|Room for Snoezelen therapy in the home of a child with a developmental disability in the Netherlands]]

'''Snoezelen''' or '''controlled multisensory environment''' ('''MSE''') is a therapy for people with [[autism]] and other [[developmental disability|developmental disabilities]], [[dementia]] or [[Acquired brain injury|brain injury]]. It consists of placing the person in a soothing and stimulating environment, called the "Snoezelen room". These rooms are specially designed to deliver stimuli to various [[senses]], using lighting effects, color, sounds, music, scents, etc. The combination of different materials on a wall may be explored using tactile senses, and the floor may be adjusted to stimulate the [[sense of balance]]. The person is usually accompanied by an aide or therapist.

Developed in the [[Netherlands]] in the 1970s, Snoezelen rooms have been established in institutions all over the world and are especially common in [[Germany]], where more than 1,200 exist.

There is no evidence that Snoezelen is effective for the treatment of dementia.&lt;ref name=Cochrane /&gt;
==Term==
The term "Snoezelen" (pronounced {{IPA|/ˈsnuzələ(n)/}}) is a [[neologism]] formed from a blend of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] "snuffelen" (to snuggle, also: to sniff) and "doezelen" (to doze, to snooze). It was coined by Jan Hulsegge and Ad Verheul who developed the concept while working at [[De Hartenberg Institute]] in the Netherlands.

==Approach==
Ideally, Snoezelen is a non-directive therapy, controlled by the client and not by the therapist. It can be staged to provide a multi-sensory experience or single sensory focus, simply by adapting the lighting, atmosphere, sounds, and textures to the specific needs of the client at the time of use. There is no formal focus on therapeutic outcome—the focus is to assist users to gain the maximum pleasure from the activity in which they and the enabler are involved. An advantage of Snoezelen therapy is that it does not rely on verbal communication and may be beneficial for people with profound autism, as it may provide stimulation for those who would otherwise be almost impossible to reach.

Snoezelen therapy relates to the interdependence of both the space (the physical environment) and the "client-centered" approach of the practitioner (the human environment). The specially designed sensory physical environment together with the input of the "enabling practitioner" initiates changes in arousal by affecting the relaxation process, reducing anxiety/pain (both physical and emotional).&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro et al., 1997; 2009a; 2009b; Fornes, Messbauer, Pagliano &amp; Verheul, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to maximize a person's potential to focus on his own free will and to engage on a motivational stimulus (object, activity or person), and thereby to improve communication and functioning.

The defining principles of the MSE help the practitioner to focus attention on the basic elements of this approach. The following are the principles.

# The experience takes place in a specific physical environment.
# The attitude of the practitioners is "client centered".
# Stimuli must be controlled according to the client's needs.
# The MSE is a medium for communication.
# The sensory environment is neither positive nor negative.
# The practitioner relies on the client's point of view. (Shapiro, 2010).

==Research==
Research on the benefits of Snoezelen treatment is scarce, with variable [[clinical study design|study designs]].&lt;ref name=Cochrane&gt;Chung JCC, Lai CKY. Snoezelen for dementia. ''The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews'' 2002, Issue '''4'''. Art. No.: [http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD003152/frame.html CD003152]. {{doi|10.1002/14651858.CD003152}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lancioni GE, Cuvo AJ, O'Reilly MF. Snoezelen: an overview of research with people with developmental disabilities and dementia. ''Disabil Rehabil.'' 2002; '''24''': 175-84. {{PMID|11926258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small research study carried out in Brussels compared the behavior of nine adult clients with profound autism in both classroom and Snoezelen settings. Though individual results varied, the study claimed a 50% reduction in distress and stereotypical behavior, and seventy-five percent less aggression and self-injury in the Snoezelen environment.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

'''Somatic experiencing''' is a form of [[alternative medicine|alternative therapy]] aimed at relieving the symptoms of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and other mental and physical trauma-related health problems by focusing on the client's perceived body sensations (or somatic experiences). It was created by trauma therapist Peter A. Levine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=van der Kolk|first1=Bessel|author-link=Bessel van der Kolk|title=The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma|date=2014|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101608302|page=217|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sessions are normally done in person, and involve a client tracking his or her own experience.&lt;ref name="Scaer 2005"&gt;Scaer, Robert C.: ''The Trauma Spectrum. Hidden Wounds and Human Resiliency''. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, N.Y. &amp; London, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|255–256}} Practitioners are often mental health practitioners such as social workers, psychologists, marriage and family therapists (MFTs) or psychotherapists, but may also be nurses, physicians, [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodyworkers]], physical therapists, chaplains, clergy, or members of other professions. Certified practitioners complete a three-year training course (216 hours of instruction) and must complete 18 hours of case consultations and 12 hours of personal sessions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaustralia.com.au/somatic-experiencing-australia_professional_training/ Somatic experiencing Australia training], Retrieved 2 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Somatic Experiencing is used for shock trauma in the short term and for developmental trauma as an adjunct to psychotherapy that may span years.

Somatic Experiencing attempts to promote awareness and release physical tension that remains in the aftermath of trauma.&lt;ref name="Scaer 2005"/&gt;{{rp|43–50}}&lt;ref name="Scaer 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scaer|first1=Robert C.|title=The Body Bears the Burden: Trauma, Dissociation, and Disease|date=2001|publisher=The Haworth Press|isbn=0789033348|pages=275|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Body_Bears_the_Burden.html?id=C30EbO7GDMIC|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38–40}}

==Methods==

Another element of Somatic Experiencing therapy is "pendulation",&lt;ref name="Scaer 2005"/&gt;{{rp|255}} the movement between regulation and dysregulation. The client is helped to move to a state where he or she is dysregulated (i.e. is aroused or frozen, demonstrated by physical symptoms such as pain or numbness) and then iteratively helped to return to a state of regulation. The goal is to allow the client to resolve the physical and mental difficulties caused by the trauma, and thereby to be able to respond appropriately to everyday situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mary-ware.com/how-does-se-work.html Mary ware Somatic Experiencing], Retrieved 2 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

"Resources" are defined as anything that helps the client's [[autonomic nervous system]] return to a regulated state. This might be the memory of someone close to them, a physical item that might ground them in the present moment, or other supportive elements that minimize distress. In the face of arousal, "discharge" is facilitated to allow the client's body to return to a regulated state. Discharge may be in the form of tears, a warm sensation, unconscious movement, the ability to breathe easily again, or other responses which demonstrate the autonomic nervous system returning to its baseline.

'''Threatcasting''' is a conceptual framework used to help multidisciplinary groups envision future scenarios. It is also a process that enables systematic planning against threats ten years in the future. Utilizing the threatcasting process, groups explore possible future threats and how to transform the future they desire into reality while avoiding undesired futures. Threatcasting is a continuous, multiple-step process with inputs from social science, technical research, cultural history, economics, trends, expert interviews, and science fiction storytelling. These inputs inform the exploration of potential visions of the future.

Once inputs are explored for impact and application, participants create a science fiction story ([[Science fiction prototyping|Science Fiction Prototyping]]) based ten years in the future to add context around human activity. Science Fiction Prototyping consists of a future story about a person in a place doing a thing. The threatcasting process results in creation of many potential futures scenarios - some futures are desirable while others are not. Identifying both types of futures (desirable and undesirable) will help the participant recognize which future to aim toward, and which to avoid. Utilizing the scenarios, participants plot actions necessary in the present and at various intervals working toward the ten year future scenario. These actions will help participants understand how to empower or disrupt the target future scenario. Flags (warning events) are also determined in order to map societal indicators onto the recommended path toward the targeted future. When identified flags appear in society, threatcasting participants map these back to the original forecast to see whether or not they are on track toward the target future scenario.

== Origins ==
{{see also|Science fiction prototyping}}

The notion of threatcasting can be traced back to Brian David Johnson, an applied futurist, who first began using threatcasting, also referred to as futurecasting, in 2011 and to George Hemingway of the Stratalis Group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stratalisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/MMStratalisFuturecasting1.pdf|title=Futurecasting the Mining Industry|last=|first=|date=January 2013|website=Stratalis Group|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who pioneered notion of futurecasting for corporate strategy and innovation industrial markets, including mining&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stratalisgroup.com/futurecasting-the-power-of-foresight/|title=The Stratalis Group {{!}}   Futurecasting: The Power of Foresight – The Final in a Six Part Series|website=www.stratalisgroup.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year. Early adopters of threatcasting include the [[United States Air Force Academy]], the [[Government of California]], and the Army Cyber Institute at [[United States Military Academy|West Point Military Academy]]. Official use of the term threatcasting is attributed to Brian David Johnson in a 2014 Gazette article “Drones, smart hydrants considered by experts looking at future of firefighting.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gazette.com/drones-smart-hydrants-considered-by-experts-looking-at-future-of-firefighting/article/1515148|title=Drones, smart hydrants considered by experts looking at future of firefighting|newspaper=Colorado Springs Gazette|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences between Threatcasting and Strategic Planning ==
Threatcasting is fundamentally different from traditional [[strategic planning]] and [[Scenario analysis|scenario building]] processes due to the identification of specific actions, indicators and concrete steps that can be taken today to disrupt, mitigate and recover from future threats.

== Applications ==
The Army Cyber Institute at West Point in conjunction with [[Arizona State University Polytechnic campus|Arizona State University's]] Global Securities Initiative and the School for the Future of Innovation in Society have established a Threatcasting Lab to host and manage a Cyber Threatcasting Project which looks to envision future cyber threats ten years in the future. The first session of this collaborative group was held at West Point, NY in August 2016.

The '''War of Ideas''' is a clash of opposing ideals, [[ideologies]], or concepts through which nations or groups use strategic influence to promote their interests abroad. The "battle space" of this conflict is the target population's "[[Winning hearts and minds|hearts and minds]]", while the "weapons" can include, inter alia, [[think tanks]], TV programs, newspaper articles, the internet, blogs, official government policy papers, traditional as well as [[public diplomacy]], or radio broadcasts.

They are, indeed, genuine wars, even though the physical violence might be minimal, because they serve a political, socio-cultural, or economic purpose, and they involve hostile intentions or hostile acts. Wars of ideas can assume many forms, but they tend to fall into four general categories (though these are not necessarily exhaustive): (a) intellectual debates, (b) ideological wars, (c) wars over religious dogma, and (d) advertising campaigns. All of them are essentially about power and influence, just as with wars over territory and material resources, and their stakes can run very high indeed|Echevarria 2008 ''Wars of Ideas and the War of Ideas''|Strategic Studies Institute of the US Army War College (SSI)}}.

==History of the concept==

{{quote|''On résiste à l'invasion des armées; on ne résiste pas à l'invasion des idées.''

{{quote|The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed, the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.|John Maynard Keynes |''The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money''|1936), chapter xxiv}}

[[Richard M. Weaver]] published ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'' in 1948 by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. The book is largely a treatise on the harmful effects of [[nominalism]] on [[Western civilization]] since that doctrine gained prominence in the [[High Middle Ages]], followed by a prescription of a course of action through which Weaver believes the West might be rescued from its decline. Weaver attributes the beginning of the Western decline to the adoption of nominalism (or the rejection of the notion of [[absolute truth]]) in the late [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] period.

In 1993, Heritage Foundation analyst James A. Phillips used the term "war of ideas" in describing the pivotal role played by the [[National Endowment for Democracy]] (NED) in the ideological battle for the protection of democracy. Phillips defended the NED as "an important weapon in the war of ideas," &lt;ref name=NED1993&gt;{{cite report |author=James A. Phillips |title=The National Endowment for Democracy: An Important Weapon in the War of Ideas |series=Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum |publisher=Heritage Foundation |number=360 |date=July 8, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; against communist dictatorships in control of China, Cuba, North Korea, and Vietnam. In a [[Cato Institute]] Foreign Policy brief, it was argued that there was no longer a need for the NED because "the democratic West has won the war of ideas against its communist adversaries." &lt;ref name=NED1993/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; commemorating the 10th anniversary of 9/11, a round table was held bringing together [[Paul Berman]], Scott Malcomson, [[James Traub]], [[David Rieff]], [[Ian Burama]] and [[Michael Ignatieff]]. Malcomson observed, 

{{quote|The American reaction to being attacked on September 11 was in many ways an intellectual one. President [[George W. Bush]] tended to frame it that way: the attack was on our "values," and the "war against terror" was a war of ideas meant to advance the idea of freedom|Scott Malcomson.

{{quote|Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was the administration's epistemologist, worrying over the question of knowability; Bernard Lewis was its historian, Paul Wolfowitz its moralist in arms. That America's actions (as opposed to precautions) after 9/11 almost all took place far from home, with a professional army, strengthened this sense of abstraction. The possibility of anything like victory over our enemies was discounted early on (by Rumsfeld). Little wonder that, unlike in earlier wars, we have talked so much about what this conflict means, rather than simply working to end it as soon as possible|Scott Malcomson|September 7, 2011|''New York Times Magazine''}}

==Intellectual debates as wars of ideas==
Intellectual debates spiral into wars of ideas when academic concepts of neutrality and objectivity are abandoned and issues devolve into embittered and divisive disputes. Echevarria argued (2008) that in the United States topics such as [[abortion]], "[[intelligent design]]" and [[evolution]] are wars of ideas.&lt;ref name=Echevarriawarsideas /&gt; When an intellectual debate devolves into a war of ideas

{{quote|... [o]pposing sides seldom change their positions based on the introduction of new evidence, or new ways of evaluating existing evidence. Thus, wars of ideas are rarely settled on the merits of the ideas themselves. Instead, they tend to drag on, unless an event occurs that causes the belligerents to focus their attention elsewhere (Echevarria).|Strategic Studies Institute of the US Army War College (SSI)}}

Echarria uses &lt;ref name=Echevarriawarsideas /&gt; Kuhn's controversial incommensurability thesis &lt;ref name=Kuhn1962&gt;{{cite book |year=1962 |title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a claim to relativism and therefore a defense of engagement in the war of ideas. [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] (1922–1996) who is one of the most influential twentieth century philosophers of science published ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962) one of the most cited publications, in which he developed the thesis of incommensurability thesis, where he argued that "theories from differing periods suffer from certain deep kinds of failure of comparability" In &lt;ref name=Kuhn1962&gt;{{cite book |year=1962 |title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The central idea is that the development of science is driven by adherence to paradigms. If a particular paradigm cannot solve an anomaly, a crisis in science may result. An existing paradigm may be superseded by a rival paradigm. There may be no common measure for assessing the competing scientific theories. They are 'incommensurable'.&lt;ref name=SEPKuhn&gt;{{cite web |title=Thomas Kuhn |author=Alexander Bird |year=2011 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common misinterpretation of paradigms is the belief that the discovery of [[paradigm shift]]s and the dynamic nature of science (with its many opportunities for subjective judgments by scientists) are a case for [[relativism]]:&lt;ref&gt;Sankey, Howard (1997) "Kuhn's ontological relativism," in ''Issues and Images in the Philosophy of Science: Scientific and Philosophical Essays in Honour of Azarya Polikarov'', edited by Dimitri Ginev and Robert S. Cohen. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1997. Boston studies in the philosophy of science, vol. 192, pp. 305-320. {{ISBN|0792344448}}&lt;/ref&gt; the view that all kinds of belief systems are equal.  Kuhn vehemently denies this interpretation and states that when a scientific paradigm is replaced by a new one, albeit through a complex social process, the new one is ''always better'', not just different.

These claims of [[relativism]] are, however, tied to another claim that Kuhn does at least somewhat endorse: that the language and theories of different paradigms cannot be translated into one another or rationally evaluated against one another &amp;mdash; that they are ''incommensurable''. This gave rise to much talk of different peoples and cultures having radically different worldviews or conceptual schemes &amp;mdash; so different that whether or not one was better, they could not be understood by one another. However, the [[philosopher]] [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] published a highly regarded essay in 1974, "On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme" (''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', Vol. 47, (1973-1974), pp.&amp;nbsp;5–20) arguing that the notion that any languages or theories could be incommensurable with one another was itself incoherent. If this is correct, Kuhn's claims must be taken in a weaker sense than they often are.  Furthermore, the hold of the Kuhnian analysis on [[social science]] has long been tenuous with the wide application of multi-paradigmatic approaches in order to understand complex human behaviour (see for example John Hassard, ''Sociology and Organization Theory: Positivism, Paradigm and Postmodernity''. Cambridge University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0521350344}}.)

==In U.S. politics==

According to political scientist [[Andrew Rich]], author of ''Think Tanks, Public Policy, and the Politics of Expertise '' &lt;ref name=thinktanks&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |author=Andrew Rich |title=Think Tanks, Public Policy, and the Politics of Expertise}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "war of ideas" is "fundamentally a battle between liberals and conservatives, progressives and libertarians, over the appropriate role for government."&lt;ref name=Rich2005&gt;

{{quote|The extreme and asymmetric partisan polarization that has evolved over several decades, initially reflecting increasing ideological differences but then extending well beyond issues that ordinarily divide the parties to advance strategic electoral interests, fits uneasily with a set of governing institutions that puts up substantial barriers to majority rule. To improve that fit—either by producing less polarized combatants or by making political institutions and practices more responsive to parliamentary-like parties—we as a people need to think about ambitious reforms of electoral rules and governing arrangements. The former can include, for example, focusing more on the demand side of campaign finance than on the supply side. |Thomas E. Mann and Norm Ornstein (2012)}}

This makes it difficult for leaders to "lead and govern effectively".

Policy-making today is "plagued by extreme partisan polarization". News coverage does not inform civic discussions. There is a lack of political civility.

==In US foreign policy==

There are two principal schools of thought on how to approach the war of ideas. The first approach advocates treating the conflict as a matter best addressed through [[public diplomacy]]—defined as the conveyance of information across a broad spectrum to include cultural affairs and political action. Accordingly, this view calls for revitalizing or transforming the [[U.S. Department of State]] and many of the traditional tools of [[Public relations|statecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=866 Dr. Antulio J. Echevarria, WARS OF IDEAS AND THE WAR OF IDEAS], p.26&lt;/ref&gt;  This school of thought contends that American public diplomacy declined after the Cold War, as evidenced by the demise of the [[U.S. Information Agency]] in 1999, and the reduction or elimination of [[Strategic Communication|strategic communications]] programs such as "[[Voice of America]]," and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]. The remedy, then, according to this view, is to re-engage the world, especially the Arab-Muslim world, by revitalizing both the form and content of U.S. public diplomacy and strategic communications, and by reinforcing those communications with concrete programs that invest in people, create opportunities for positive exchanges, and help build friendships. In fact, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and its Iraqi component, [[Radio Free Iraq]], and [[Al-Hurra]] TV are now actively participating in U.S. strategic communication efforts, though with debatable effectiveness; all this has occurred, in part, by taking resources from Voice of America.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Curtis, "Efforts to Deal with America's Image Abroad: Are They Working?" Testimony before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight, April 26, 2007, p. 6.[http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/35034.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In direct contrast, the second school of thought advocates treating the war of ideas as a "real war," wherein the objective is to destroy the influence and credibility of the opposing ideology, to include neutralizing its chief proponents. This approach sees [[public diplomacy]] as an essential, but insufficient tool because it requires too much time to achieve desired results, and does little to aid the immediate efforts of combat forces in the field. For this school of thought, the principal focus of the war of ideas ought to be how to use the ways and means of [[information warfare]] to eliminate terrorist groups.&lt;ref&gt;Walid Phares, "The War of Ideas: Jihadism against Democracy,"(New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007); Waller, "Fighting the War of Ideas"; Zeyno Baran, "Fighting the War of Ideas," Foreign Affairs,Vol. 84, No. 6, November/December 2005, pp. 68–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use during the Cold War==
[[File:Chile quema libros 1973.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Book burnings in Chile]] following the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|1973 coup]] that installed the [[Military government of Chile (1973–1990)|Pinochet regime]]. Note the painting with a [[Che Guevara]] portrait being burned.]]
According to Dr. John Lenczowski, former Director of European and Soviet Affairs for the National Security Council during the Reagan administration, 'The Cold War took many forms, including proxy wars, the arms race, nuclear blackmail, economic warfare, subversion, covert operations and the battle for men's minds.  While many of these forms had the trappings of traditional conflicts of national interests, there was a dimension to the Cold War that made it unique among wars: it centered around a war of ideas—a war between two alternative political philosophies.''&lt;ref&gt;Dr. John Lenczowski,[http://www.phillysoc.org/lenctex.htm ''Emboldening Domestic Resistance to Communism: Presidential Rhetoric and the War of Information and Ideas Against the Soviet Union'']&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], the United States and other Western powers developed a robust infrastructure for waging a ''war of ideas'' against the [[communist]] ideology being promulgated by the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies. During the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, the so-called golden age of U.S. propaganda, counterpropaganda, and public diplomacy operations, the U.S. government carried out a sophisticated program of overt and covert activities designed to shape public opinion behind the [[Iron Curtain]], within European intellectual and cultural circles, and across the developing world.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1131"&gt;William Rosenau,[http://www.rand.org/pubs/reprints/2006/RAND_RP1218.pdf The RAND Corporation, “Waging the “war of Ideas,”](The McGraw-Hill Homeland Security Handbook, Chapter 72, pp. 1131–1148, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The United States was able to reach as much as 50–70% of the populations behind the Iron Curtain during the 1950s through their international broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Gough,[http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/gough.pdf ‘‘The Evolution of Strategic Influence,’’] USAWC [U.S. Army War College] Strategy Research Project, Carlisle Barracks, Pa. (April 7, 2004), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; High-level interest in such operations waned during the 1970s, but received renewed emphasis under President Ronald Reagan, the ''Great Communicator,'' who, like Eisenhower, was a firm advocate of the informational component of America's Cold War strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Gough,[http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/gough.pdf ‘‘The Evolution of Strategic Influence,’’PP.20–24]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with the end of the Cold War official interest once again plummeted. During the 1990s, Congress and the executive branch disparaged informational activities as costly Cold War anachronisms. The budget for State Department informational programs was slashed, and [[USIA]], a quasi-independent body that reported to the secretary of state, was disestablished, and its responsibilities were transferred to a new undersecretary of state for public diplomacy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1131"/&gt;

==Use in the War on Terror==

Terrorism is a form of political and psychological warfare; it is protracted, high-intensity propaganda, aimed more at the hearts of the public and the minds of decision makers, and not at the physical victims.&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael Waller, Fighting the War of Ideas like a Real War (The Institute of World Politics Press,2007), p.20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; There is growing recognition among U.S. government officials, journalists, and analysts of terrorism that defeating al-Qaida— arguably the preeminent challenge to U.S. security—will require far more than ''neutralizing'' leaders, disrupting cells, and dismantling networks.&lt;ref&gt;William Rosenau,[http://www.rand.org/pubs/reprints/2006/RAND_RP1218.pdf The RAND Corporation, “Waging the “war of Ideas,”] (The McGraw-Hill Homeland Security Handbook, Chapter 72, pp. 1131–1148, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[9/11 Commission]] concluded in its final report, eliminating al-Qaida as a formidable danger ultimately requires ''prevailing in the longer term over the ideology that gives rise to Islamist terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States,[http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf The 9/11 Commission Report] (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 2004), p. 363.
&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Akbar Ahmed]], a Muslim scholar who holds the Chair of Islamic Studies at American University, explains: Properly understood, this is a war of ideas within Islam—some of them faithful to authentic Islam, but some of them clearly un-Islamic and even blasphemous toward the peaceful and compassionate Allah of the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael Waller, Fighting the War of Ideas like a Real War,  Washington, DC: The Institute of World Politics Press, 2007, p. 68. [http://jmw.typepad.com/political_warfare/files/War_of_Ideas_Waller.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans, in general, are fundamentally opposed waging what seems as a blatantly ideological struggle seems quite unnatural to Americans and other Westerners, who tend to downplay intangible factors such as ideas, history, and culture as political motivators, preferring instead to stress relatively more concrete driving forces such as personal security and physical well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Carnes Lord, ''The Psychological Dimension in National Strategy,'' in Frank R. Barnett and Carnes Lord (eds.), Political Warfare and Psychological Operations(Washington, D.C.: National Defense University Press, 1989): 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States military has recently begun incorporating a strategic communication into their overall battle operations in the [[War on Terror]], especially in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].  In addition to the military's traditional role of using force they are beginning to use political as well as [[ideological]] warfare against the enemy as a method of influencing the local populations into opposing say the [[Taliban]] or [[al Qa'ida]]. The ancient Chinese philosopher [[Sun Tzu]] once said that to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Sun Tzu, Art of War, http://suntzusaid.com/book/3&lt;/ref&gt; The War of Ideas attempts to  "break the enemy's resistance."

==Terrorists' use of mass media==

Users of terror tactics' strategic communications goals are aimed at legitimizing, propagating, and intimidating their audience. Their skilful use of the mass media and the internet has enabled them to keep generating new generations of followers.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Carsten Bockstette, "Jihadist Terrorist Use of Strategic Communication Management Techniques" http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/MCDocs/files/College/F_Publications/occPapers/occ-paper_20-en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaida's message, disseminated widely and effectively through all forms of mass media, including the Internet, has a powerful appeal in much of the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous [Michael Scheuer], Imperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror (Washington: Brassey's, 2004), pp. 209–12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, an al-Qaeda spokesman described Osama bin Laden's strategic [[influence of mass media]] in the Arab world:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sheikh Usama knows that the media war is not less important than the military war against America. That's why al-Qaeda has many media wars. The Sheikh has made al-Qaeda's media strategy something that all TV stations look for. There are certain criteria for the stations to be able to air our videos, foremost of which is that it has not taken a previous stand against the mujahedeen. That maybe explains why we prefer Al-Jazeera to the rest.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Gendron,[http://www.itac-ciem.gc.ca/pblctns/tc_prsnts/2007-2-eng.asp Trends in Terrorism Series: Al-Qaeda: Propaganda and Media Strategy](2007) ITAC Presents Vol. 2007-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Media and the internet enable terrorists to thrive in a cancerous manner in the freedom that democracies provide. The intensive, sometimes obsessive coverage in the media about a terrorist act generates the desired psychological effect. Terrorist actions are planned and organized in a manner that causes a strategically maximum communicative effect, while requiring minimal resources. The symbiotic relationship between terror events and the media is apparent: the perpetrators would have far less impact without media publicity and the media can hardly be expected to resist reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Elihu &amp; Liebes, Tamar, "'No More Peace!' How Disaster, Terror and War have Upstaged Media Events." International Journal of Communication (2007), 157–166.http://ijoc.org/ojs/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/44/23&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite TV and the internet offers terrorists expanded possibilities of influencing and manipulating audiences.

==Terrorist media publication companies==

Terrorist groups are utilizing mass media, particularly the internet, to win the "War of Ideas" because their inability to win a traditional head-to-head war against a military force.

==Methods==

For instance in the West's battle against jihadist terrorists:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ensuring one's own credibility while undermining the jihadists' credibility is one of the key elements to winning this battle. It is possible to counteract the three primary terroristic communication goals, the propagation and enlargement of their movement, the legitimization of their movement and the coercion and intimidation of their enemies. Next to eliminating root causes and alleviating the underlying conditions, motivators and enablers of terrorism, such as terrorists' physical bases, developing an effective counter strategic communication plan, which exploits weaknesses and contradictions in the jihadists' use of strategic communication techniques, is vital in winning the asymmetrical conflict with jihadist terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Carsten Bockstette |title=Jihadist Terrorist Use of Strategic Communication Management Techniques |page=5 |url=http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/MCDocs/files/College/F_Publications/occPapers/occ-paper_20-en.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''War on Terror''', also known as the '''Global War on Terrorism''', is an international military campaign that was launched by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] after the [[September 11 attacks]] against the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Schmitt/slogan"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/26/politics/26strategy.html?_r=0|title=U.S. Officials Retool Slogan for Terror War|first=|newspaper= New York Times|date=26 July 2005|author=Eric Schmitt|author2=Thom Shanker}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The naming of the campaign uses a [[War as metaphor|metaphor of war]] to refer to a variety of actions that do not constitute a specific war as traditionally defined. U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] first used the [[Slogans and terms derived from the September 11 attacks|term]] "''war on terrorism"'' on 16 September 2001,&lt;ref name="evilwar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="evilwar2" /&gt; and then "''war on terror''" a few days later in a formal speech to Congress.&lt;ref name="whitehousejoint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnntranscript" /&gt;  In the latter speech, George Bush stated, "Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them."&lt;ref name="cnntranscript" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/attacked/transcripts/bushaddress_092001.html|title=washingtonpost.com|website=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was originally used with a particular focus on countries associated with [[al-Qaeda]].  The term was immediately criticised by such people as [[Richard B. Myers]], chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and more nuanced ones subsequently came to be used by the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] to publicly define the international campaign led by the U.S.;&lt;ref name="Schmitt/slogan" /&gt; it was never used as a formal designation of U.S. operations in internal government documentation.&lt;ref name="Ambinder2013"&gt;{{cite news |title=The New Term for the War on Terror |author=Marc Ambinder |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/05/the-new-term-for-the-war-on-terror/56969/ |newspaper=The Atlantic |date=20 May 2010 |accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] announced on 23 May 2013 that the Global War on Terror is over, saying the military and intelligence agencies will not wage war against a tactic but will instead focus on a specific group of networks determined to destroy the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/05/23/obama-global-war-on-terror-is-over|title=Obama: 'Global War on Terror' Is Over|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 December 2014, the Obama administration announced the end of the combat role of the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-war-idUSKBN0K60FB20141228|title=U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan ends combat role; thousands of…|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the unexpected rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] terror group led to a new operation against terror in the Middle East and South Asia, [[Operation Inherent Resolve]].

[[Criticism of the War on Terror]] focused on morality, efficiency, economics; some, including later president [[Barack Obama]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/aug/06/white-house-war-terrorism-over/ White House: ‘War on terrorism’ is over] August 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="declover" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whitehdefuniv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="terrorover" /&gt; objected to the phrase itself as a [[misnomer]]. The notion of a "war" against "terrorism" has proven contentious, with critics charging that it has been exploited by participating governments to pursue long-standing policy/military objectives,&lt;ref name="Monbiot2003" /&gt; reduce [[civil liberties]],&lt;ref name="Wired-FBI" /&gt; and infringe upon human rights. Critics also assert that the term "war" is not appropriate in this context (much like the term "[[War on Drugs]]") since there is no identifiable enemy and it is unlikely that international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.&lt;ref name="Richissin" /&gt;

=={{anchor|Terminology}}Etymology==

[[File:OCO GWOT.jpg|thumb|Letter from Barack Obama indicating appropriation of Congressional funds for "Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism"]]

The phrase "War on Terror" has been used to specifically refer to the ongoing military campaign led by the U.S., U.K. and their allies against organizations and regimes identified by them as terrorist, and usually excludes other independent [[counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist operations and campaigns]] such as those by Russia and India.

===History of use of the phrase and its rejection by the U.S. government===
{{update|section|date=April 2018}}
In 1984, the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], which had significantly expanded the CIA-run [[Operation Cyclone|program of funding]] the [[Mujahideen|Jihadi militants in Afghanistan]], employed the term "war against terrorism" to pass legislation aimed at countering terrorist groups in the wake of the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]] that killed 241 U.S. and 58 French [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silver |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1973131,00.html |title=How America Became a Surveillance State |work=Time Magazine |date=18 March 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U.S. Vice President]] [[Mike Pence]] called the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing "the opening salvo in a war that we have waged ever since—the global war on terror,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/trump-administration-says-war-terror-began-911-hezbollah-attack-us-troops-691653|title=Mike Pence says Hezbollah started the war on terror with a 1983 attack in Beirut|date=24 October 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the U.S. at war with terrorism may have begun on 11 September 2001 when [[Tom Brokaw]], having just witnessed the collapse of one of the towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], declared "Terrorists have declared war on [America]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.nbclearn.com/portal/site/k-12/flatview?cuecard=1419 |title=Breaking News on September 11th |author=[[Matt Lauer]] |author2=[[Katie Couric]] |author3=Tom Brokaw |date=11 September 2001 |website=NBC Learn K-12 |publisher=NBCUniversal Media |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 2001, at [[Camp David]], U.S. president George W. Bush used the phrase ''war on terrorism'' in an ostensibly unscripted comment when answering a journalist′s question about the impact of enhanced law enforcement authority given to the [[Mass surveillance in the United States|U.S. surveillance]] agencies on Americans′ civil liberties: "This is a new kind of — a new kind of evil.

In April 2007, the British government announced publicly that it was abandoning the use of the phrase "War on Terror" as they found it to be less than helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Reynolds|first=Paul |date=17 April 2007 |title=Declining use of 'war on terror' |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6562709.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was explained more recently by Lady [[Eliza Manningham-Buller]]. In her 2011 [[Reith lecture]], the former head of [[MI5]] said that the 9/11 attacks were "a crime, not an act of war. So I never felt it helpful to refer to a war on terror."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Norton-Taylor |first=Richard |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2 September 2011 |title=MI5 former chief decries 'war on terror' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/sep/02/mi5-war-on-terror-criticism |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. president [[Barack Obama]] rarely used the term, but in his inaugural address on 20 January 2009, he stated: "Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Inauguration/story?id=6689022&amp;page=1 |title=FULL TRANSCRIPT: President Barack Obama's Inaugural Address|publisher=ABC News |date=20 January 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009 the Defense Department officially changed the name of operations from "Global War on Terror" to "Overseas Contingency Operation" (OCO).&lt;ref name="oco-wapost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/24/AR2009032402818.html|title='Global War On Terror' Is Given New Name|author1=Scott Wilson |author2=Al Kamen |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=The Washington Post|date= 25 March 2009 |page= A04|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] requested that [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] staff members avoid the use of the term and instead to use "Overseas Contingency Operation".&lt;ref name="oco-wapost"/&gt; Basic objectives of the Bush administration "war on terror", such as targeting al Qaeda and building international counterterrorism alliances, remain in place.&lt;ref&gt;Jai Singh and Ajay Singh, "[http://smallwarsjournal.com/printpdf/13142 The War on Terror – Over] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120045914/http://smallwarsjournal.com/printpdf/13142 |date=20 January 2013 }}?", ''Small Wars Journal'', 28 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Kravets, "[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/09/bush-obama-war-on-terror/ Former CIA Chief: Obama's War on Terror Same as Bush's, But With More Killing]", ''Wired'', 10 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, the Obama administration published a report outlining its [[National Security Strategy (United States)|National Security Strategy]].  The document dropped the Bush-era phrase "global war on terror" and reference to "Islamic extremism," and stated, "This is not a global war against a tactic  —  terrorism, or a religion  —  Islam. We are at war with a specific network, al-Qaeda, and its terrorist affiliates who support efforts to attack the United States, our allies, and partners."&lt;ref name=declover&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/7772598/Barack-Obama-declares-the-War-on-Terror-is-over.html Barack Obama declares the 'War on Terror' is over: President Barack Obama has rejected George W.

In December 2012, [[Jeh Johnson]], the [[General Counsel of the Department of Defense]], stated that the military fight would be replaced by a [[law enforcement]] operation when speaking at [[Oxford University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pentagon lawyer: War on terror not endless |agency=The Associated Press |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/dec/01/eu-britain-us-al-qaida/ |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |publisher=Greenspun Media Group |date=1 December 2012 |accessdate=4 December 2012}}{{Dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; predicting that al Qaeda will be so weakened to be ineffective, and has been "effectively destroyed", and thus the conflict will not be an armed conflict under [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pentagon Lawyer Looks Post-Terror |author=Julian E.

In May 2013, two years after the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|assassination]] of [[Osama bin Laden]], Barack Obama delivered a speech that employed the term ''global war on terror'' put in quotation marks (as officially transcribed by the White House): ″Now, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists. &lt; ... &gt; But we have to recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. &lt; ... &gt; From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions that we are making now will define the type of nation  —  and world  —  that we leave to our children.  So America is at a crossroads.  We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us.  We have to be mindful of James Madison's warning that "No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare."  &lt; ... &gt; In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for that country's security. &lt; ... &gt;  Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless "global war on terror," but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America.  In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries.″ Nevertheless, in the same speech, in a bid to emphasise the legality of military actions undertaken by the U.S., noting that [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Congress had authorised]] the use of force, he went on to say, ″Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces.  We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first.  So this is a just war  —  a war waged proportionally, in last resort, and in self-defense.″&lt;ref name=whitehdefuniv&gt;[https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/23/remarks-president-national-defense-university Remarks by the President at the National Defense University] The White House, 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=terrorover&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama: 'Global War on Terror' Is Over |author=Paul D.

===The rhetorical war on terror===

Because the actions involved in the "war on terrorism" are diffuse, and the criteria for inclusion are unclear, political theorist Richard Jackson has argued that "the 'war on terrorism,' therefore, is simultaneously a set of actual practices—wars, covert operations, agencies, and institutions—and an accompanying series of assumptions, beliefs, justifications, and narratives—it is an entire language or discourse."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''Writing the War on Terrorism'' (2005), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson cites among many examples a statement by [[John Ashcroft]] that "the attacks of September 11 drew a bright line of demarcation between the civil and the savage".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''Writing the War on Terrorism'' (2005), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Administration officials also described "terrorists" as hateful, treacherous, barbarous, mad, twisted, perverted, without faith, [[Parasitism|parasitical]], inhuman, and, most commonly, evil.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''Writing the War on Terrorism'' (2005), pp. 62–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Americans, in contrast, were described as brave, loving, generous, strong, resourceful, heroic, and respectful of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''Writing the War on Terrorism'' (2005), pp. 77–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the term and the policies it denotes have been a source of ongoing controversy, as critics argue it has been used to justify unilateral [[preventive war]], human rights abuses and other violations of international law.&lt;ref&gt;Borhan Uddin Khan and Muhammad Mahbubur Rahman, "Combating Terrorism under Human Rights and Humanitarian Law Regime", ''Mediterranean Journal of Human Rights," Vol. 12 (Double Issue), 2008, pp.379–397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==

===Precursor to the September 11 attacks===
{{See also|Islamic terrorism|List of Islamist terrorist attacks}}

The origins of al-Qaeda can be traced back to the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] (December 1979 – February 1989). The United States, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, [[Pakistan]], and the People's Republic of China supported the [[Islamism|Islamist]] Afghan [[mujahadeen]] [[guerilla warfare|guerillas]] against the military forces of the Soviet Union and the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. A small number of "Afghan Arab" volunteers joined the fight against the Soviets, including [[Osama bin Laden]], but there is no evidence they received any external assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergen|first=Peter|title=The Osama Bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of Al-Qaeda's Leader|publisher=Free Press|year=2006|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1996 the group World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders (WIFJAJC), sponsored by bin Laden (and later re-formed as al-Qaeda), started forming a large base of operations in [[Afghanistan]], where the Islamist extremist regime of the [[Taliban]] had seized power earlier in the year.&lt;ref&gt;The group was also responsible for the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]].{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/06/news/mn-12224|title=Fighters Hunt Former Ally|date=6 December 2001|author=Megan K.

On the morning of September 11, 2001, [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|nineteen men]] [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] four [[jet airliner]]s all bound for California.

On 20 September 2001, in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]], George W. Bush delivered an ultimatum to the Taliban government of Afghanistan, the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]], to turn over Osama bin Laden and [[al-Qaeda]] leaders operating in the country or face attack.&lt;ref name="cnntranscript" /&gt; The Taliban demanded evidence of bin Laden's link to the 11 September attacks and, if such evidence warranted a trial, they offered to handle such a trial in an Islamic Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taliban rejects president Bush's demands |publisher=PBS |date=21 September 2001 |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/september01/taliban_9-21.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601224636/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/september01/taliban_9-21.html |archivedate=1 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. refused to provide any evidence.

Subsequently, in October 2001, U.S. forces (with UK and coalition allies) invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban regime. On 7 October 2001, the official invasion began with British and U.S. forces conducting [[airstrike]] campaigns over enemy targets. Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan, [[Fall of Kabul|fell by mid-November]]. The remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban remnants fell back to the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, mainly Tora Bora. In December, Coalition forces (the U.S. and its allies) [[Battle of Tora Bora|fought within that region]]. It is believed that Osama bin Laden escaped into Pakistan during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/world/asia/29torabora.html?_r=1 |title=Senate Report Explores 2001 Escape by bin Laden From Afghan Mountains |work=The New York Times |date=28 November 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |first=Scott |last=Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/29/osama-bin-laden-senate-report |title=Rumsfeld let Bin Laden escape in 2001, says Senate report |date=29 November 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |first=Ed |last=Pilkington |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2002, the U.S. and other [[NATO]] and non-NATO forces launched [[Operation Anaconda]] with the goal of destroying any remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in the [[Shah-i-Kot Valley]] and [[Arma Mountains]] of Afghanistan. The Taliban suffered heavy casualties and evacuated the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.atimes.com/c-asia/DC12Ag01.html |work=[[Asia Times Online]] |date=12 March 2002 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |first=Syed Saleem |last=Shahzad |title=Taliban find unlikely allies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

December 2001 saw the creation of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to assist the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]] and the first post-Taliban elected government. With a renewed Taliban insurgency, it was announced in 2006 that ISAF would replace the U.S. troops in the province as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

The British [[16th Air Assault Brigade]] (later reinforced by [[Royal Marines]]) formed the core of the force in southern Afghanistan, along with troops and helicopters from Australia, Canada and the Netherlands. The initial force consisted of roughly 3,300 British, 2,000 Canadian, 1,400 from the Netherlands and 240 from Australia, along with special forces from Denmark and [[Estonia]] and small contingents from other nations. The monthly supply of cargo containers through Pakistani route to ISAF in Afghanistan is over 4,000 costing around {{nowrap|12 billion}} in Pakistani Rupees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2011/01/29/war-on-terror-cost-of-us-taxpayers-patience/#.TtjwPLLNllk |title=Afghan war cost rise tests US taxpayers' patience |publisher=Thenewstribe.com |date=29 January 2011 |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK troops take over Afghan duties|date=1 June 2006|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4961368.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada set for longer Afghan stay |date=16 June 2006 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4984880.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia outlines Afghan force|date=8 May 2006|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4983540.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More Dutch troops for Afghanistan |date=3 February 2006 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4673026.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iraq]] had been listed as a [[State sponsor of terrorism]] by the U.S. since 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq accuses U.S., Turkey of 'illegally' meeting with Kurds |publisher=CNN |date=9 March 2000 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/03/09/un.iraq/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516120925/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/03/09/un.iraq/index.html |archivedate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Saddam Hussein]] [[invasion of Kuwait|invaded Kuwait]]. Iraq had also been on the list from 1979 to 1982; it was removed so that the U.S. could provide material support to Iraq in its [[Iran–Iraq War|war with Iran]]. Hussein's regime had proven to be a problem for the UN and Iraq's neighbors due to its use of [[chemical weapons]] against [[Iranian people|Iranians]] and [[Kurds]] in the 1980s.

===Iraqi no-fly zones===

Following the ceasefire agreement that suspended hostilities (but not officially ended) in the 1991 [[Gulf War]], the United States and its allies instituted and began patrolling [[Iraqi no-fly zones]], to protect Iraq's [[Kurds|Kurdish]] and [[Shi'a]] [[Arab]] population—both of which suffered attacks from the Hussein regime before and after the Gulf War—in Iraq's northern and southern regions, respectively. U.S. forces continued in combat zone deployments through November 1995 and launched [[Operation Desert Fox]] against Iraq in 1998 after it failed to meet U.S. demands for "unconditional cooperation" in weapons inspections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton: Iraq has abused its final chance |publisher=CNN |date=16 December 1998 |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/12/16/clinton/index.html?eref=sitesearch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of Operation Desert Fox, during December 1998, Iraq announced that it would no longer respect the no-fly zones and resumed its attempts to shoot down U.S. aircraft.

===Operation Iraqi Freedom===
{{Main|Iraq War}}

The Iraq War began in March 2003 with an air campaign, which was immediately followed by a [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S.-led ground invasion]].

In January 2007, President Bush presented a new strategy for Operation Iraqi Freedom based upon [[counter-insurgency]] theories and tactics developed by General [[David Petraeus]]. The [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]] was part of this "new way forward" and, along with U.S. backing of [[Sunni]] groups it had previously sought to defeat, has been credited with a widely recognized dramatic decrease in violence by up to 80%.

In a major split in the ranks of Al Qaeda's organization, the Iraqi franchise, known as [[Al Qaeda in Iraq]] covertly invaded Syria and the Levant and began participating in the ongoing Syrian Civil War, gaining enough support and strength to re-invade Iraq's western provinces under the name of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIS/ISIL), taking over much of the country in a [[blitzkrieg]]-like action and combining the [[Iraqi insurgency (2011–14)|Iraq insurgency]] and [[Syrian Civil War]] into a single conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/ctc-perspectives-al-baghdadis-blitzkrieg-isils-psychological-warfare-and-what-it-means-for-syria-and-iraq |title=CTC Perspectives: Al-Baghdadi's Blitzkrieg, ISIL's Psychological Warfare, and What it Means for Syria and Iraq |last1=Price |first1=Bryan |last2=Milton |first2=Dan |last3=al-'Ubaydi |first3=Muhammad |date=12 June 2014 |website=Combating Terrorism Center |publisher=United States Military Academy |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their extreme brutality and a complete change in their overall ideology, Al Qaeda's core organization in Central Asia eventually denounced ISIS and directed their affiliates to cut off all ties with this organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Calamur |first=Krishnadev |date=13 June 2014 |title=ISIS: An Islamist Group Too Extreme Even For Al-Qaida |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/06/13/321665375/isis-an-islamist-group-too-extreme-even-for-al-qaida |newspaper=National Public Radio |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many analysts{{who|date=September 2014}} believe that because of this schism, Al Qaeda and ISIL are now in a competition to retain the title of the world's most powerful terrorist organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-war-between-isis-and-al-qaeda-for-supremacy-of-the-global-jihadist|title=The War between ISIS and al-Qaeda for Supremacy of the Global Jihadist Movement – The Washington Institute for Near East Policy|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, former President of Pakistan [[Pervez Musharraf]] sided with the U.S. against the Taliban government in Afghanistan after an ultimatum by then U.S. President George W. Bush. Musharraf agreed to give the U.S. the use of three airbases for Operation Enduring Freedom. [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] and other U.S. administration officials met with Musharraf. On 19 September 2001, Musharraf addressed the people of Pakistan and stated that, while he opposed military tactics against the Taliban, Pakistan risked being endangered by an alliance of India and the U.S. if it did not cooperate. In 2006, Musharraf testified that this stance was pressured by threats from the U.S., and revealed in his memoirs that he had "war-gamed" the United States as an adversary and decided that it would end in a loss for Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-09-25-pakistan-memoir_x.htm|title= Musharraf's book says Pakistan faced U.S. 'onslaught' if it didn't back terror war|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014|work=USA Today|date=26 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2002, Musharraf gave a speech against Islamic extremism. He unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism and pledged to combat Islamic extremism and lawlessness within Pakistan itself. He stated that his government was committed to rooting out extremism and made it clear that the banned militant organizations would not be allowed to resurface under any new name. He said, "the recent decision to ban extremist groups promoting militancy was taken in the national interest after thorough consultations. It was not taken under any foreign influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dawn.com/dawnftp/72.249.57.55/dawnftp/fixed/arch/arch_2003.html |title=Musharraf vows to root out extremism: Banned outfits won't be allowed to resurface |publisher=Dawn.Com |date=5 December 2003 |first=Rafaqat |last=Ali |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317081424/http://archives.dawn.com/dawnftp/72.249.57.55/dawnftp/fixed/arch/arch_2003.html |archivedate=17 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Musharraf-led government took a firm stand against the jihadi organizations and groups promoting extremism, and arrested [[Maulana Masood Azhar]], head of the [[Jaish-e-Mohammed]], and [[Hafiz Muhammad Saeed]], chief of the [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]], and took dozens of activists into custody. An official ban was imposed on the groups on 12 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/DH20Df07.html |title=Musharraf braced for jihadi backlash |publisher=Atimes.com |date=20 August 2002 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] born [[Abu Zubaydah|Zayn al-Abidn Muhammed Hasayn Abu Zubaydah]] was arrested by Pakistani officials during a series of joint U.S.-Pakistan raids.

In 2004, the [[Pakistan Army]] launched a campaign in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] of Pakistan's [[Waziristan]] region, sending in 80,000 troops. The goal of the conflict was to remove the al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in the area.

After the fall of the Taliban regime, many members of the Taliban resistance fled to the Northern border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan where the Pakistani army had previously little control. With the logistics and air support of the United States, the Pakistani Army captured or killed numerous al-Qaeda operatives such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, wanted for his involvement in the USS ''Cole'' bombing, the [[Bojinka plot]], and the killing of ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter [[Daniel Pearl]].

The United States has carried out a campaign of [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|Drone attacks]] on targets all over the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. However, the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|Pakistani Taliban]] still operates there. To this day it is estimated that 15 U.S. soldiers were killed while fighting al-Qaeda and Taliban remnants in Pakistan since the War on Terror began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icasualties.org/oef/ |title=Operation Enduring Freedom &amp;#124; Afghanistan |publisher=iCasualties |date=28 May 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406083558/http://icasualties.org/oef/ |archivedate=6 April 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of drones by the Central Intelligence Agency in Pakistan to carry out operations associated with the Global War on Terror sparks debate over sovereignty and the laws of war. The U.S. Government uses the CIA rather than the [[U.S. Air Force]] for strikes in Pakistan to avoid breaching sovereignty through military invasion. The United States was criticized by{{according to whom|date=May 2015}} a report on drone warfare and [[Airspace|aerial sovereignty]] for abusing the term 'Global War on Terror' to carry out military operations through government agencies without formally declaring war.

In the three years before the attacks of 11 September, Pakistan received approximately {{nowrap|US$9 million}} in American military aid. In the three years after, the number increased to {{nowrap|US$4.2 billion}}, making it the country with the maximum funding post 9/11.

===Baluchistan===
An uprising in [[Baluchistan]] began after Pakistan invaded and occupied the territory in 1948. Various NGOs have reported human rights violations in committed by Pakistani armed forces.

[[File:Northern Mali conflict.svg|thumb]]

Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara (OEF-TS) is the name of the military operation conducted by the U.S. and partner nations in the Sahara/Sahel region of Africa, consisting of counter-terrorism efforts and policing of arms and drug trafficking across central Africa.

The [[Northern Mali conflict (2012–present)|conflict in northern Mali]] began in January 2012 with radical Islamists (affiliated to al-Qaeda) advancing into northern Mali. The Malian government had a hard time maintaining full control over their country. The fledgling government requested support from the international community on combating the Islamic militants. In January 2013, France intervened on behalf of the Malian government's request and deployed troops into the region. They launched [[Operation Serval]] on 11 January 2013, with the hopes of dislodging the al-Qaeda affiliated groups from northern Mali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mali conflict: militants killed as French air strikes pound rebel camps|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/13/mali-crisis-militants-killed-french-jets|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 January 2013|location=London|first=Nick|last=Hopkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This extension of Operation Enduring Freedom was titled OEF-HOA. Unlike other operations contained in Operation Enduring Freedom, OEF-HOA does not have a specific organization as a target. OEF-HOA instead focuses its efforts to disrupt and detect militant activities in the region and to work with willing governments to prevent the reemergence of militant cells and activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCE–HORN OF AFRICA |publisher=United States Africa Command |url=http://www.hoa.africom.mil/AboutCJTF-HOA.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426223216/http://www.hoa.africom.mil/AboutCJTF-HOA.asp |archivedate=26 April 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, the [[Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa]] (CJTF-HOA) was established in [[Djibouti]] at [[Camp Lemonnier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10504.pdf |title=DOD Needs to Determine the Future of Its Horn of Africa Task Force |publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] |date = April 2010|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains approximately 2,000 personnel including U.S. military and special operations forces (SOF) and coalition force members, [[Combined Task Force 150]] (CTF-150).

Task Force 150 consists of ships from a shifting group of nations, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Pakistan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The primary goal of the coalition forces is to monitor, inspect, board and stop suspected shipments from entering the Horn of Africa region and affecting the United States' [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].

Included in the operation is the training of selected armed forces units of the countries of Djibouti, [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]] in counter-terrorism and [[counter-insurgency]] tactics. Humanitarian efforts conducted by CJTF-HOA include rebuilding of schools and medical clinics and providing medical services to those countries whose forces are being trained.

The program expands as part of the [[Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative]] as CJTF personnel also assist in training the armed forces of [[Chad]], Niger, [[Mauritania]] and [[Mali]]. However, the War on Terror does not include Sudan, where over 400,000 have died in an ongoing civil war.

On 1 July 2006, a Web-posted message purportedly written by Osama bin Laden urged [[Somalis]] to build an [[Islamic state]] in the country and warned western governments that the al-Qaeda network would fight against them if they intervened there.&lt;ref name="BIN-LADEN-MESSAGE-IRAQ-SOMALIA"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-07-01-bin-laden-plans-message_x.htm |title=Bin Laden releases Web message on Iraq, Somalia |work=USA Today |date=1 July 2006 |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somalia has been considered a "[[failed state]]" because its official central government was weak, dominated by warlords and unable to exert effective control over the country. Beginning in mid-2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), an Islamist faction campaigning on a restoration of "law and order" through [[Sharia]] law, had rapidly taken control of much of southern Somalia.

On 14 December 2006, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State [[Jendayi Frazer]] claimed al-Qaeda cell operatives were controlling the Islamic Courts Union, a claim denied by the ICU.&lt;ref name="US-SAYS-AL-QAEDA-BEHIND-SOMALI-ISLAMISTS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L14556061.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204082431/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L14556061.htm |archivedate=2008-02-04 |title=U.S. says al Qaeda behind Somali Islamists |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=4 February 2008 |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 2006, the UN-backed [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) of Somalia had seen its power effectively limited to [[Baidoa]], while the Islamic Courts Union controlled the majority of southern Somalia, including the capital of [[Mogadishu]]. On 20 December 2006, the Islamic Courts Union launched an [[Battle of Baidoa|offensive]] on the government stronghold of Baidoa and saw early gains before Ethiopia intervened for the government.

By 26 December, the Islamic Courts Union retreated towards Mogadishu, before again retreating as TFG/Ethiopian troops neared, leaving them to take Mogadishu with [[Fall of Mogadishu|no resistance]].

''NBC News'' reported that in mid-2014, [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya|ISIS had about 1,000 fighters in Libya]]. Taking advantage of a power vacuum in the center of the country, far from the major cities of Tripoli and Benghazi, ISIS expanded rapidly over the next 18 months. Local militants were joined by jihadists from the rest of North Africa, the Middle East, Europe and the Caucasus. The force absorbed or defeated other Islamist groups inside Libya and the central ISIS leadership in Raqqa, Syria, began urging foreign recruits to head for Libya instead of Syria. ISIS seized control of the coastal city of [[Sirte]] in early 2015 and then began to expand to the east and south. By the beginning of 2016, it had effective control of 120 to 150 miles of coastline and portions of the interior and had reached Eastern Libya's major population center, [[Benghazi]]. In spring 2016, [[United States Africa Command|AFRICOM]] estimated that ISIS had about 5,000 fighters in its stronghold of Sirte.&lt;ref name="Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/did-obama-defeat-isis-libya-n709001|title=Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya?|publisher=NBC news|date=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the indigenous rebel groups who had staked their claims to Libya and turned their weapons on ISIS — with the help of airstrikes by Western forces, including U.S. drones, the Libyan population resented the outsiders who wanted to establish a fundamentalist regime on their soil.

According to U.S. military estimates, ISIS ranks shrank to somewhere between a few hundred and 2,000 fighters. In August 2016, the [[Military intervention against ISIL#Intervention in Libya|U.S. military began airstrikes]] that, along with continued pressure on the ground from the Libyan militias, pushed the remaining ISIS fighters back into Sirte, In all, U.S. drones and planes hit ISIS nearly 590 times, the Libyan militias reclaimed the city in mid-December.&lt;ref name="Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya"/&gt; On January 18, 2017, ''ABC News'' reported that two USAF [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 bombers]] struck two ISIS camps {{convert|28|mi}} south of Sirte, the airstrikes targeted between 80 and 100 ISIS fighters in multiple camps, an unmanned aircraft also participated in the airstrikes. ''NBC News'' reported that as many as 90 ISIS fighters were killed in the strike, a U.S. defense official said that "This was the largest remaining ISIS presence in Libya," and that "They have been largely marginalized, but I am hesitant to say they have been eliminated in Libya."&lt;ref name="Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya"/&gt;

Operation Active Endeavour is a [[Navy|naval operation]] of NATO started in October 2001 in response to the 11 September attacks. It operates in the Mediterranean and is designed to prevent the movement of militants or [[weapons of mass destruction]] and to enhance the security of shipping in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_7932.htm |title=Operation Active Endeavour |publisher=[[NATO]] |date=10 November 2010 |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 'Letter to American People' written by [[Osama bin Laden]] in 2002, he stated that one of the reasons he was fighting America is because of its support of India on the Kashmir issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/report/2002/021120-ubl.htm|title=Osama bin Laden "letter to the American people"|author=John Pike|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver|title=Full text: bin Laden's 'letter to America'|work=the Guardian|accessdate=14 September 2014|location=London|date=24 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; While on a trip to Delhi in 2002, U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] suggested that [[Al-Qaeda]] was active in Kashmir, though he did not have any hard evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2043800.stm|title=Analysis: Is al-Qaeda in Kashmir?|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014|work=BBC News|first=Zaffar|last=Abbas|date=13 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/06/13/1023864326179.html|title=Rumsfeld offers US technology to guard Kashmir border|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=14 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, [[The Christian Science Monitor]] published an article claiming that Al-Qaeda and its affiliates were "thriving" in [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]] with the tacit approval of Pakistan's National Intelligence agency [[Inter-Services Intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0702/p01s02-wosc.html|title=Al Qaeda thriving in Pakistani Kashmir|date=2 July 2002|website=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of [[Special Air Service]] and [[Delta Force]] was sent into [[Indian-administered Kashmir]] in 2002 to hunt for Osama bin Laden after reports that he was being sheltered by the Kashmiri militant group [[Harkat-ul-Mujahideen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/1385795/SAS-joins-Kashmir-hunt-for-bin-Laden.html|title=SAS joins Kashmir hunt for bin Laden|date=23 February 2002|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=14 September 2014|location=London|first=Michael|last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. officials believed that Al-Qaeda was helping organize a campaign of terror in Kashmir to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan.

==International military support==
{{Main|Participants in Operation Enduring Freedom|Multi-National Force – Iraq}}
{{See also|Coalition combat operations in Afghanistan in 2008|Afghan War order of battle 2012}}

[[File:BritishPatrolHelmand01.jpg|thumb|The United Kingdom is the second largest contributor of troops in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]]]

The invasion of Afghanistan is seen to have been the first action of this war, and initially involved forces from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Afghan [[Northern Alliance]]. Since the initial invasion period, these forces were augmented by troops and aircraft from Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand and Norway amongst others. In 2006, there were about 33,000 troops in Afghanistan.

On 12 September 2001, less than 24 hours after the 11 September attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., NATO invoked Article 5 of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] and declared the attacks to be an attack against all 19 NATO member countries. Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] also stated that Australia would invoke the [[ANZUS]] Treaty along similar lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=14 September 2001 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2001/s367069.htm |title=PM speaks on Ansett collapse, Anzus treaty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following months, NATO took a broad range of measures to respond to the threat of terrorism. On 22 November 2002, the member states of the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]] (EAPC) decided on a Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism, which explicitly states, "[The] EAPC States are committed to the protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights, as well as the rule of law, in combating terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism |url=http://pfpdev.ethz.ch/SCORMcontent/72234/scos/93/documents/0.pdf |date=22 November 2002 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |publisher=[[NATO]]}}{{Dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; NATO started naval operations in the Mediterranean Sea designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction as well as to enhance the security of shipping in general called Operation Active Endeavour.

Support for the U.S. cooled when America made clear its determination to invade Iraq in late 2002. Even so, many of the "coalition of the willing" countries that unconditionally supported the U.S.-led military action have sent troops to Afghanistan, particular neighboring Pakistan, which has disowned its earlier support for the Taliban and contributed tens of thousands of soldiers to the conflict. Pakistan was also engaged in the [[War in North-West Pakistan]] (Waziristan War). Supported by U.S. intelligence, Pakistan was attempting to remove the Taliban insurgency and al-Qaeda element from the northern tribal areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New frontline in the war on terror.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terrorist attacks and failed plots since 9/11==

===Al-Qaeda===
{{Main|al-Qaeda}}

Since 9/11, Al-Qaeda and other affiliated radical Islamist groups have executed attacks in several parts of the world where conflicts are not taking place. Whereas countries like Pakistan have suffered hundreds of attacks killing tens of thousands and displacing much more.
* The [[2002 Bali bombings]] in Indonesia were committed by various members of [[Jemaah Islamiyah]], an organization linked to Al-Qaeda.
* The [[2003 Casablanca bombings]] were carried out by [[Salafia Jihadia]], an Al-Qaeda affiliate.
* After the [[2003 Istanbul bombings]], Turkey charged 74 people with involvement, including Syrian Al-Qaeda member [[Loai al-Saqa]].
* The [[2004 Madrid train bombings]] in Spain were "inspired by" Al-Qaeda, though no direct involvement has been established.
* The [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] in the United Kingdom were perpetrated by four [[Homegrown terrorism|homegrown terrorists]], one of whom appeared in an edited video with a known Al-Qaeda operative, though the British government denies Al-Qaeda involvement.
* Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the [[11 April 2007 Algiers bombings]] in Algeria.
* The [[2007 Glasgow International Airport attack]] in the United Kingdom was carried out by a pair of bombers whose laptops and suicide notes included videos and speeches referencing Al-Qaeda, though no direct involvement was established.

[[File:Liberty.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] helicopter patrols the airspace over New York City]]

In addition to military efforts abroad, in the aftermath of 9/11, the Bush Administration increased domestic efforts to prevent future attacks. Various government bureaucracies that handled security and military functions were reorganized. A new cabinet-level agency called the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] was created in November 2002 to lead and coordinate the largest reorganization of the U.S. federal government since the consolidation of the armed forces into the Department of Defense.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The Justice Department launched the [[National Security Entry-Exit Registration System]] for certain male non-citizens in the U.S., requiring them to register in person at offices of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].

The USA PATRIOT Act of October 2001 dramatically reduces restrictions on law enforcement agencies' ability to search telephone, e-mail communications, medical, financial, and other records; eases restrictions on foreign intelligence gathering within the United States; expands the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]'s authority to regulate financial transactions, particularly those involving foreign individuals and entities; and broadens the discretion of law enforcement and immigration authorities in detaining and deporting immigrants suspected of terrorism-related acts. The act also expanded the definition of terrorism to include domestic terrorism, thus enlarging the number of activities to which the USA PATRIOT Act's expanded law enforcement powers could be applied. A new [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program]] monitored the movements of terrorists' financial resources (discontinued after being revealed by ''[[The New York Times]]''). Global telecommunication usage, including those with no links to terrorism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/10/double-danger-nsa-surveillance |title=The double danger of the NSA's 'collect it all' policy on surveillance &amp;#124; Rachel Levinson-Waldman &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=theguardian.com |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; is being collected and monitored through the [[NSA electronic surveillance program]]. The Patriot Act is still in effect.

Political interest groups have stated that these laws remove important restrictions on governmental authority, and are a dangerous encroachment on civil liberties, possible [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] violations of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. On 30 July 2003, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) filed the first legal challenge against Section 215 of the Patriot Act, claiming that it allows the [[FBI]] to violate a citizen's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights, Fourth Amendment rights, and right to [[due process]], by granting the government the right to search a person's business, bookstore, and library records in a terrorist investigation, without disclosing to the individual that records were being searched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/2003/august2003/firstpatriot.cfm |title=American Libraries – First Patriot Act Challenge Filed by ACLU |publisher=ALA |date=4 August 2003 |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122043434/http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/2003/august2003/firstpatriot.cfm |archivedate=22 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, governing bodies in many communities have passed symbolic resolutions against the act.

[[File:John Walker Lindh Custody.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Walker Lindh]] was captured as an enemy combatant during the United States' [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]]]]

In a speech on 9 June 2005, Bush said that the USA PATRIOT Act had been used to bring charges against more than 400 suspects, more than half of whom had been convicted. Meanwhile, the ACLU quoted Justice Department figures showing that 7,000 people have complained of abuse of the Act.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) began an initiative in early 2002 with the creation of the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, designed to promote information technologies that could be used in counter-terrorism. This program, facing criticism, has since been defunded by Congress.

By 2003, 12 major conventions and protocols were designed to combat terrorism. These were adopted and ratified by many states. These conventions require states to co-operate on principal issues regarding unlawful seizure of aircraft, the physical protection of nuclear materials, and the freezing of assets of militant networks.&lt;ref&gt;Cindy C Combs (2003), Terrorism in the Twenty First Century, (3rd Edition, New Jersey: Pearsons Educ. Inc.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the UN Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1624|Resolution 1624]] concerning incitement to commit acts of terrorism and the obligations of countries to comply with international human rights laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sc/ctc/ |title=UN Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611145715/http://www.un.org/sc/ctc/ |archivedate=11 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both resolutions require mandatory annual reports on counter-terrorism activities by adopting nations, the United States and Israel have both declined to submit reports. In the same year, the [[United States Department of Defense]] and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] issued a planning document, by the name "National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism", which stated that it constituted the "comprehensive military plan to prosecute the Global War on Terror for the [[Military of the United States|Armed Forces of the United States]]...including the findings and recommendations of the [[9/11 Commission]] and a rigorous examination with the Department of Defense".

On 9 January 2007, the House of Representatives passed a bill, by a vote of 299–128, enacting many of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission The bill passed in the U.S. Senate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00073|title=U.S. Senate: Roll Call Vote|date=27 January 2015|website=senate.gov|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a vote of 60–38, on 13 March 2007 and it was signed into law on 3 August 2007 by President Bush. It became Public Law 110-53. In July 2012, U.S. Senate passed a resolution urging that the [[Haqqani Network]] be designated a [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|foreign terrorist organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/us-cong-votes-for-designating-haqqani-network-as-terror-group/980665/|title= US Cong votes for designating Haqqani network as terror group| date= 28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Office of Strategic Influence]] was secretly created after 9/11 for the purpose of coordinating propaganda efforts but was closed soon after being discovered. The Bush administration implemented the [[Continuity of Operations Plan]] (or Continuity of Government) to ensure that U.S. government would be able to continue in catastrophic circumstances.

Since 9/11, extremists made various attempts to attack the United States, with varying levels of organization and skill. For example, vigilant passengers aboard a transatlantic flight prevented [[Richard Reid (shoe bomber)|Richard Reid]], in 2001, and [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]], in 2009, from detonating an explosive device.

Other terrorist plots have been stopped by federal agencies using new legal powers and investigative tools, sometimes in cooperation with foreign governments.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Such thwarted attacks include:
* The [[2001 shoe bomb plot]]
* A plan to crash airplanes into the [[U.S. Bank Tower (Los Angeles)|U.S. Bank Tower]] (aka Library Tower) in Los Angeles
* The 2003 plot by [[Iyman Faris]] to blow up the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] in New York City
* The [[2004 Financial buildings plot]], which targeted the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] buildings in Washington, D.C., the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and other financial institutions
* The 2004 [[Columbus Shopping Mall Bombing Plot]]
* The [[2006 Sears Tower plot]]
* The [[2007 Fort Dix attack plot]]
* The [[2007 John F. Kennedy International Airport attack plot]]
* The [[Najibullah Zazi|New York Subway Bombing Plot]] and [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]]

The Obama administration has promised the closing of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], increased the number of troops in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], and promised the withdrawal of its forces from [[War in Iraq|Iraq]].

==="Extraordinary rendition"===

After the September 11 attacks, the United States government commenced a program of illegal "[[extraordinary rendition]]," sometimes referred to as "irregular rendition" or "forced rendition," the government-sponsored [[kidnapping|abduction]] and [[extrajudicial]] transfer of a person from one country to transferee countries, with the consent of transferee countries.&lt;ref name="54 countries"&gt;{{cite news |author=Max Fisher |title=A staggering map of the 54 countries that reportedly participated in the CIA's rendition program|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/02/05/a-staggering-map-of-the-54-countries-that-reportedly-participated-in-the-cias-rendition-program/ |quote= |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=5 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/22/us-extraordinary-rendition-programme|title=New light shed on US government's extraordinary rendition programme|first1=Ian|last1=Cobain|first2=James|last2=Ball|date=22 May 2013|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/cia-photographed-naked-detainees|title=CIA photographed detainees naked before sending them to be tortured|first=Spencer|last=Ackerman|date=28 March 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of extraordinary rendition is often conducting [[torture]] on the detainee that would be difficult to conduct in the U.S. legal environment, a practice known as [[torture by proxy]].

===Rendition to "Black Sites===
In 2005, ''The Washington Post'' and [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) published revelations concerning CIA kidnapping of detainees and their transport to "[[black site]]s," covert prisons operated by the CIA and whose existence is denied by the US government. The [[European Parliament]] published a report connecting use of such secret detention Black Sites for detainees kidnapped as part of extraordinary rendition (''[[Extraordinary rendition#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|See below]]''). Although some Black Sites have been known to exist inside [[European Union]] states, these detention centers violate the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) and the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|UN Convention Against Torture]], treaties that all EU member states are bound to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Europeans Probe Secret CIA Flights | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/16/AR2005111602198.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The Washington Post | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | date=17 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= EU to look into 'secret US jails' | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4403166.stm | accessdate=18 December 2005 |publisher=BBC News  | date=3 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=U.S. Faces Scrutiny Over Secret Prisons | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/03/AR2005110300422.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The Washington Post | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | date=4 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ABC News]] two such facilities, in countries mentioned by Human Rights Watch, have been closed following the recent publicity with the CIA relocating the detainees. Almost all of these detainees were tortured as part of the "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]" of the CIA.&lt;ref name="AbcNews051205"&gt;{{cite news | title=Exclusive: Sources Tell ABC News Top Al Qaeda Figures Held in Secret CIA Prisons | url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1375123 | accessdate=18 December 2005 | publisher=ABC News | date=5 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major American newspapers, such as the "[[The Washington Post]]," have been criticized for deliberately withholding publication of articles reporting locations of Black Sites. The Post defended its decision to suppress this news on the ground that such revelations "could open the [[U.S. government]] to legal challenges, particularly in foreign courts, and increase the risk of political condemnation at home and abroad." However, according to [[Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting]] "the possibility that illegal, unpopular government actions might be disrupted is not a consequence to be feared, however—it's the whole point of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|U.S. First Amendment]]. ... Without the basic fact of where these prisons are, it's difficult if not impossible for 'legal challenges' or 'political condemnation' to force them to close." FAIR argued that the damage done to the global reputation of the United States by the continued existence of black-site prisons was more dangerous than any threat caused by the exposure of their locations.&lt;ref name="FAIR 2005"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Consequences of Covering Up | url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2715 | accessdate=18 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The complex at Stare Kiejkuty, a Soviet-era compound once used by German intelligence in World War II, is best known as having been the only Russian intelligence training school to operate outside the Soviet Union. Its prominence in the Soviet era suggests that it may have been the facility first identified—but never named—when the Washington Post's Dana Priest revealed the existence of the CIA's secret prison network in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Soviet-era compound in northern Poland was site of secret CIA interrogation, detentions | url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2007/Sovietera_compound_in_Poland_was_site_0307.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The journalists who exposed this provided their sources and this information and documents were provided to ''The Washington Post'' in 2005. In addition, they also identified such Black Sites are concealed:

{{quote|Former European and US intelligence officials indicate that the secret prisons across the European Union, first identified by the Washington Post, are likely not permanent locations, making them difficult to identify and locate.

What some believe was a network of secret prisons was most probably a series of facilities used temporarily by the United States when needed, officials say. Interim "black sites"—secret facilities used for covert activities—can be as small as a room in a government building, which only becomes a black site when a prisoner is brought in for short-term detainment and interrogation.}}

The journalists went on to explain that "Such a site, sources say, would have to be near an airport." The airport in question is the [[Szczytno-Szymany International Airport]].

In response to these allegations, former Polish intelligence chief, [[Zbigniew Siemiatkowski]], embarked on a media blitz and claimed that the allegations were "... part of the domestic political battle in the US over who is to succeed current Republican President George W Bush," according to the German news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Former Polish intelligence chief who says report on CIA detention site part of US domestic battle admitted CIA had access to facility | url=http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Former_Polish_intelligence_chief_who_says_0308.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prison ships ====
The United States has also been accused of operating "[[Prison ship|floating prisons]]" to house and transport those arrested in its [[war on terror#US objectives|''War on Terror'']], according to human rights lawyers. They have claimed that the US has tried to conceal the numbers and whereabouts of detainees. Although no credible information to support these assertions has ever come to light, the alleged justification for prison ships is primarily to remove the ability for jihadists to target a fixed location to facilitate the escape of high value targets, commanders, operations chiefs etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Duncan Campbell |author2=Richard Norton-Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/02/usa.humanrights |title=US accused of holding terror suspects on prison ships |work=The Guardian  |location=London |date= 2 June 2008|accessdate=17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties==

According to Joshua Goldstein, an [[international relations]] professor at the [[American University]], The Global War on Terror has seen fewer war deaths than any other decade in the past century.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Joshua S. [https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/08/15/think_again_war "Think Again: War"]. ''Foreign Policy Magazine'', 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no widely agreed on figure for the number of people that have been killed so far in the War on Terror as it has been defined by the Bush Administration to include the war in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq, and operations elsewhere. The [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]] and the Physicians for Social Responsibility and Physicians for Global Survival give total estimates ranging from {{nowrap|1.3 million}} to {{nowrap|2 million}} casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/study-1-3-million-killed-in-usa-war-on-terror/article/429180|title=Doctors' group says 1.3 million killed in U.S. 'War on Terror'|date=25 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study from 2018 by Brown University's [[Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs]] puts the total number of casualties of the War on Terror in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan between 480,000 and 507,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 9, 2018 |title=US 'war on terror' has killed over half a million people: study|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/wars-terror-killed-million-people-study-181109080620011.html|work=[[Al Jazeera]]|location= |access-date=November 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimates for regional conflicts include the following:

The author found it impossible to provide an upper-end estimate to direct civilian casualties from the [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] bombing campaign that he noted as having an increased use of [[cluster bombs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comw.org/pda/0201oef.html#1 |title=Operation Enduring Freedom: Why a Higher Rate of Civilian Bombing Casualties – Bombers and cluster bombs |publisher=Comw.org |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this lower-end estimate, only Western press sources were used for hard numbers, while heavy "reduction factors" were applied to Afghan government reports so that their estimates were reduced by as much as 75%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comw.org/pda/0201oef.html#appendix1 |title=Operation Enduring Freedom: Why a Higher Rate of Civilian Bombing Casualties – Appendix 1.

:*In similar numbers, a [[Los Angeles Times]] review of U.S., British, and Pakistani newspapers and international wire services found that between 1,067 and 1,201 direct civilian deaths were reported by those news organizations during the five months from 7 October 2001 to 28 February 2002.

On December 7, 2015, the Washington Post reported that since 2001, in five theaters of the war (Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Somalia) that the total number of terrorists killed ranges from 65,800 to 88,600, with the Obama administration being responsible for between 30,000 and 33,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/07/president-obama-likes-to-brag-about-the-terrorists-he-has-taken-out-how-many-is-that-exactly/|title=How many terrorists has President Obama actually 'taken out'?

==Costs==
The War on Terror, spanning decades, is a multi-trillion-dollar war.

According to the Costs of War Project at [[Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs|Brown University's Watson Institute]], the War on Terror will have cost $5.6 trillion for operations between 2001-2018 plus anticipated future costs of veterans' care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Engelhardt|first1=Tom|title=America's 'War on Terror' Has Cost Taxpayers $5.6 Trillion|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/americas-war-on-terror-has-cost-taxpayers-5-6-trillion/|accessdate=20 May 2018|publisher=The Nation|date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Soufan Group in July 2015, the U.S. government was spending {{nowrap|$9.4 million}} per day in operations against ISIS in Syria and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://soufangroup.com/tsg-intelbrief-terrorism-in-the-horn-of-africa/|title = TSG IntelBrief: Terrorism in the Horn of Africa|date = 2015-07-28|accessdate = 2015-07-28|website = The Soufan Group|publisher = |location = New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of the War on Terror}}

[[File:World Can't Wait J4 Demo.jpg|thumb|Participants in a rally, dressed as hooded detainees]]

Criticism of the War on Terror addressed the issues, morality, efficiency, economics, and other questions surrounding the War on Terror and made against the phrase itself, calling it a [[misnomer]]. The notion of a "war" against "terrorism" has proven highly contentious, with critics charging that it has been exploited by participating governments to pursue long-standing policy/military objectives,&lt;ref name="Monbiot2003"&gt;[[George Monbiot]], [http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2003/03/11/a-wilful-blindness "A Wilful Blindness"] ("Those who support the coming war with Iraq refuse to see that it has anything to do with US global domination"), ''monbiot.com'' (author's website archives), reposted from ''[[The Guardian]]'', 11 March 2003. Retrieved 28 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; reduce [[civil liberties]],&lt;ref name="Wired-FBI"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/03/fbi-tried-to-co/|title=FBI Tried to Cover Patriot Act Abuses With Flawed, Retroactive Subpoenas, Audit Finds|last=Singel|first=Ryan|date=13 March 2008|work=Wired |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and infringe upon human rights. It is argued that the term war is not appropriate in this context (as in [[War on Drugs]]) since there is no identifiable enemy and that it is unlikely international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.&lt;ref name="Richissin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002023596_russanal02.html |title="War on terror" difficult to define |last=Richissin |first=Todd |date=2 September 2004 |work=The Baltimore Sun |accessdate=28 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114085106/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002023596_russanal02.html |archivedate=14 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics, such as [[Francis Fukuyama]], note that "[[Definition of terrorism|terrorism]]" is not an enemy, but a tactic; calling it a "war on terror", obscures differences between conflicts such as anti-occupation [[Insurgency|insurgents]] and international [[mujahideen]]. With a military presence in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] and its associated collateral damage, [[Shirley Williams]] maintains this increases resentment and terrorist threats against the West.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Shirley.

==Other Wars on Terror==

In the 2010s, [[China]] has also been engaged in its own War on Terror, predominantly a domestic campaign in response to violent actions by [[Uyghur people|Uighur]] separatist movements in the [[Xinjiang conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/china/chinas-war-terror-september-11-uighur-separatism/p4765|title=China's 'War on Terror': September 11 and Uighur Separatism|date=|website=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign was widely criticized in international media due to the perception that it unfairly targets and [[persecutes]] [[Chinese Muslims]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/chinas-war-on-terror-becomes-all-out-attack-on-islam-in-xinjiang/2014/09/19/5c5840a4-1aa7-4bb6-bc63-69f6bfba07e9_story.html|title=China's war on terror becomes all-out attack on Islam in Xinjiang|author=Simon Denyer|date=19 September 2014|website=Washington Post|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; potentially resulting in a negative backlash from [[China]]'s predominantly [[Muslim]] [[Uyghur people|Uighur]] population.

[[Russia]] has also been engaged on its own, also largely internally focused, counter-terrorism campaign often termed a war on terror, during the [[Second Chechen War]], the [[Insurgency in the North Caucasus]], and the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2093529,00.html | work=Time | title=Breaking News, Analysis, Politics, Blogs, News Photos, Video, Tech Reviews - TIME.com | date=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[China]]'s war on terror, [[Russia]]'s has also been focused on [[separatist]] and [[Islamist]] movements that use [[political violence]] to achieve their ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwu.edu/~ieresgwu/assets/docs/demokratizatsiya%20archive/10-4_Cohen.PDF | title=Russia, Islam, and the War on Terrorism | first=Ariel | last=Cohen | accessdate=29 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3224">In [[model theory]], a '''weakly o-minimal structure''' is a model theoretic [[Structure (mathematical logic)| structure]] whose definable sets in the domain are just finite unions of convex sets.

==Definition==
A [[Total order|linearly ordered]] structure, ''M'', with language ''L'' including an ordering relation &lt;, is called weakly o-minimal if every parametrically definable subset of ''M'' is a finite union of convex (definable) subsets. A theory is weakly o-minimal if all its models are weakly o-minimal.

Note that, in contrast to [[o-minimality]], it is possible for a theory to have models which are weakly o-minimal and to have other models which are not weakly o-minimal.&lt;ref&gt;M.A.Dickmann,  ''Elimination of Quantifiers for Ordered Valuation Rings'', The Journal of symbolic Logic, Vol. 52, No. 1 (Mar., 1987), pp 116-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference from o-minimality==
In an o-minimal structure &lt;math&gt;(M,&lt;,...)&lt;/math&gt; the definable sets in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; are finite unions of points and intervals, where ''interval'' stands for a sets of the form &lt;math&gt;I=\{r\in M\,:\,a&lt;r&lt;b\}&lt;/math&gt;, for some ''a'' and ''b'' in &lt;math&gt;M \cup \{\pm \infty\}&lt;/math&gt;.  For weakly o-minimal structures &lt;math&gt;(M,&lt;,...)&lt;/math&gt; this is relaxed so that the definable sets in ''M'' are finite unions of convex definable sets.  A set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is convex if whenever ''a'' and ''b'' are in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, ''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b'' and ''c''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; satisfies that ''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b'', then ''c'' is in ''C''. Points and intervals are of course convex sets, but there are convex sets which are not either points or intervals, as explained below.

If we have a weakly o-minimal structure expanding ('''R''',&lt;), the real ordered field, then the structure will be o-minimal. The two notions are different in other settings though.  For example, let ''R'' be the ordered field of real [[algebraic number]]s with the usual ordering &lt; inherited from '''R'''.  Take a transcendental number, say ''[[Pi|π]]'', and add a [[unary relation]] ''S'' to the structure given by the subset (&amp;minus;''π'',''π'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;cap;&amp;nbsp;''R''.  Now consider the subset ''A'' of ''R'' defined by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;0&lt;a \,\wedge\, S(a)&lt;/math&gt;

so that the set consists of all strictly positive real algebraic numbers that are less than ''π''.  The set is clearly convex, but cannot be written as a finite union of points and intervals whose endpoints are in ''R''.  To write it as an interval one would either have to include the endpoint ''π'', which isn't in ''R'', or one would require infinitely many intervals, such as the union

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{\alpha&lt;\pi}(0,\alpha).&lt;/math&gt;

Since we have a definable set that isn't a finite union of points and intervals, this structure is not o-minimal.  However, it is known that the structure is weakly o-minimal, and in fact the theory of this structure is weakly o-minimal.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macpherson, D. Marker, C. Steinhorn, ''Weakly o-minimal structures and real closed fields'', Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. '''352''' (2000), no. 12, pp.5435&amp;ndash;5483, {{MathSciNet | id = 1781273}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
