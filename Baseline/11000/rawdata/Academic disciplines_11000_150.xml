'''Aerodynamic heating''' is the heating of a solid body produced by its high-speed passage through air (or by the passage of air past a test object in a [[wind tunnel]]), whereby its kinetic energy [[heat transfer|is converted to heat]] by [[Friction#Skin friction|skin friction]] on the surface of the object at a rate that depends on the [[viscosity]] and speed of the air. In science and engineering, it is most frequently a concern regarding [[meteors]], [[Atmospheric entry|reentry vehicles]], and  the design of high-speed [[aircraft]].

==Physics==
At high speeds through the air, the object's [[kinetic energy]] is converted to heat through compression and friction. At lower speed, the object will lose heat to the air through which it is passing, if the air is cooler. The combined temperature effect of heat from the air and from passage through it is called the [[stagnation temperature]]; the actual temperature is called the recovery temperature.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; These viscous dissipative effects to neighboring sub-layers make the [[boundary layer]] slow down via a non-[[isentropic]] process.  Heat then conducts into the surface material from the higher temperature air. The result is an increase in the temperature of the material and a loss of energy from the flow. The forced convection ensures that other material replenishes the gases that have cooled to continue the process.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}

The stagnation and the recovery temperature of a flow increases with the speed of the flow and are greater at high speeds. The total [[thermal loading]] of the object is a function of both the recovery temperature and the mass flow rate of the flow. Aerodynamic heating is greatest at high speed and in the lower atmosphere where the density is greater.  In addition to the convective process described above, there is also [[Thermal radiation]] from the flow to the body and vice versa with the net direction set by the relative temperature of each.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}

Aerodynamic heating increases with the speed of the vehicle. Its effects are minimal at [[Speed of sound|subsonic speed]]s but at [[supersonic speed]]s beyond about M2.2 it dictates the design/materials of the vehicle structure and internal systems. The heating effects are greatest at [[leading edge]]s but the whole vehicle heats up to a stabilized temperature if it remains at speed. Aerodynamic heating is dealt with by the use of high temperature alloys for metals, the addition of insulation of the exterior of the vehicle, or the use of [[ablative material]].

==Aircraft==
Aerodynamic heating is a concern for [[supersonic aircraft|supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] aircraft.

One of the main concerns caused by aerodynamic heating arises in the design of the wing. When the structure of an aircraft wing is designed, there are two main considerations that must be accounted for when this aircraft is to fly at subsonic speeds: minimizing weight and maximizing strength. Aerodynamic heating, which occurs at supersonic and hypersonic aircraft speeds, adds an additional consideration in wing structure analysis. In an idealized wing structure, a wing is made up of spars, stringers, and skin segments. In a wing that normally experiences subsonic speeds, there must be a sufficient number of stringers to withstand the axial and bending stresses induced by the lift force acting on the wing. In addition, the distance between the stringers must be small enough that the skin panels do not buckle, and the panels must be thick enough to withstand the shear stress and shear flow present in the panels due to the lifting force on the wing. However, the weight of the wing must be made as small as possible, so the choice of material for the stringers and the skin is an important factor.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}

At supersonic airspeeds, aerodynamic heating adds another element to this structural analysis. At normal speeds, spars and stringers experience a load called Delta P, which is a function of the lift force, first and second moments of inertia, and length of the spar. When there are more spars and stringers, the Delta P in each member is reduced, and the area of the stringer can be reduced to meet critical stress requirements. However, the increase in temperature caused by energy flowing from the air (heated by skin friction at these high speeds) adds another load factor, called a thermal load, to the spars. This thermal load increases the net force felt by the stringers, and thus the area of the stringers must be increased in order for the critical stress requirement to be met.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}

Another issue that aerodynamic heating causes for aircraft design is the effect of high temperatures on common material properties. Common materials used in aircraft wing design, such as aluminum and steel, experience a decrease in strength as temperatures get extremely high. The Young’s Modulus of the material, defined as the ratio between stress and strain experienced by the material, decreases as the temperature increases. Young’s Modulus is critical in the selection of materials for wing, as a higher value lets the material resist the yield and shear stress caused by the lift and thermal loads. This is because Young's Modulus is an important factor in the equations for calculating the critical buckling load for axial members and the critical buckling shear stress for skin panels. If the Young’s Modulus of the material decreases at high temperatures caused by aerodynamic heating, then the wing design will call for larger spars and thicker skin segments in order to account for this decrease in strength as the aircraft goes supersonic. There are some materials that retain their strength at the high temperatures that aerodynamic heating induces. For example, Inconel X was used for the wing skins of the X-15, a North American aircraft that flew at hypersonic speeds in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weisshaar |first=Dr. Terry A.|title=Aerospace Structures- an Introduction to Fundamental Problems |year=2011 |publisher=Purdue University |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titanium is another high-strength material, even at high temperatures, and is often used for wing frames of supersonic aircraft. The [[SR-71]] used titanium skin panels painted black to reduce the temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rich |first1=Ben R. |last2=Janos |first2=Leo |title=Skunk works: a personal memoir of my years at Lockheed |year=1994 |publisher=Warner Books |isbn=0751515035 |page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; and corrugated to accommodate expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Clarence L. |last2=Smith |first2=Maggie |title=Kelly: more than my share of it all |year=1985 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0874744911|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important design concept for early supersonic aircraft wings was using a small [[thickness-to-chord ratio]], so that the speed of the flow over the airfoil does not increase too much from the free stream speed. As the flow is already supersonic, increasing the speed even more would not be beneficial for the wing structure. Reducing the thickness of the wing brings the top and bottom stringers closer together, reducing the total moment of inertia of the structure. This increases is axial load in the stringers, and thus the area, and weight, of the stringers must be increased. Some designs for hypersonic missiles have used liquid cooling of the [[leading edge]]s (usually the fuel en route to the engine). The [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint missile]]'s heat shield needed several design iterations for Mach 10 temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Bell Labs 1974, 9-17&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reentry vehicles ==
Heating caused by the very high reentry speeds (greater than [[Mach number|Mach]] 20) is sufficient to destroy the vehicle unless special techniques are used. The early space capsules such as used on [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] were given blunt shapes to produce a stand-off bow shock, allowing most of the heat to dissipate into the surrounding air. Additionally, these vehicles had ablative material that [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]]s into a gas at high temperature. The act of sublimation absorbs the thermal energy from the aerodynamic heating and erodes the material away as opposed to heating the capsule. The surface of the heat shield for the Mercury spacecraft had a coating of aluminum with glassfiber in many layers. As the temperature rose to {{convert|1100|C|K|sigfig=2}} the layers would evaporate and take the heat with it. The spacecraft would become hot but not harmfully so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Project Mercury Worked |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/project-mercury2.htm |website=How Stuff Works |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Space Shuttle]] used insulating [[tile]]s on its lower surface to absorb and radiate heat while preventing conduction to the aluminum [[airframe]].  The damage to the heat shield during liftoff of [[Space Shuttle]] ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' contributed to its [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|destruction]] upon reentry.

The '''Albert Einstein Institution''' is a non-profit organization that specializes in the study of the methods of [[nonviolent resistance]] in conflicts and to explore its policy potential and communicate these findings through print and other media, translations, [[Academic conference|conferences]], consultations, and workshops. The institution's founder and senior scholar, [[Gene Sharp]], is known for his writings on strategic nonviolent struggle.

==History==
The institute is named after the [[physicist]] [[Albert Einstein]], who was, at least at some points in his life, a pacifist. The institution "is committed to the defense of freedom, democracy, and the reduction of political violence through the use of nonviolent action".

To further this mission, the Institution has supported research projects; actively consulted with resistance and pro-democracy groups from [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Egypt]], [[Tibet]], [[Serbia]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], the [[Occupied Palestinian Territories]], and elsewhere; and worked to publicize the power and potential of nonviolent struggle around the world through educational materials, scholarly writings, workshops, and the media.

The Albert Einstein Institution was founded in 1983 and operates out of a small office in [[East Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].

A feature documentary by Scottish director, [[Ruaridh Arrow]], ''[[How to Start a Revolution]]'', about the global influence of the Albert Einstein Institution and Gene Sharp's work was released in September 2011. The film won "Best Documentary" and "The Mass Impact Award" at the Boston Film Festival in September 2011.[10] The European premiere was held at London's Raindance Film Festival on October 2, 2011 where it also won Best Documentary.[11] The film has been described as the unofficial film of the Occupy Wall St movement being shown in Occupy camps in cities all over the world. The film screened to MPs and Lords in the British Houses of Parliament on February 1, 2012.

'''Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES)''' is a leading research institute in [[Nainital]], [[Uttarakhand]] which specializes in [[Astronomy]], [[Astrophysics]] and [[Atmospheric Sciences]]. An autonomous body under the [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology]] (DST), [[Government of India]], the institute is situated at Manora Peak (1,951 m (6,401&amp;nbsp;ft)), about 9&amp;nbsp;km from [[Nainital]], a popular hill station.&lt;ref name="ni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nainital.nic.in/observatory.htm |title=Local attractions: Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) |publisher=[[Nainital district]] official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829134618/http://nainital.nic.in/observatory.htm |archivedate=29 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Observatory#Astronomical observatories|astronomical observatory]] is open to the public during working days on afternoons. For night viewing however, three - four days on moonlight nights are fixed and prior permission is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nainitaltourism.com/observatory_aries.html|title=OBSERVATORY ( Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES)|publisher=Official Nainital tourism website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The institute was started on 20 April 1954 under the supervision of Dr.A.N.Singh as Uttar Pradesh State Observatory (UPSO) in the premises of the [[Govt. Sanskrit College]], presently known as [[Sampurnanand Sanskrit University]], [[Varanasi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]].
With the creation of the State of [[Uttarakhand]] on 9 Nov 2000, and because of its geographical location within the boundaries of [[Uttarakhand]], UPSO came under the administrative control of the new government and was re-christened as the State Observatory (SO). Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) was its new name when it came under the Department of Science &amp; Technology (DST), Govt. of India as an autonomous body on 22 March 2004.

==Research facilities==
===Astronomy and Astrophysics===
[[File:Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Belgian PM Charles Michel activate the ARIES Telescope located in Uttarakhand.jpg|thumb|300px|Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] and Belgian Prime Minister [[Charles Michel]] remotely activate the ARIES telescope from [[Brussels]] on 30 March 2016.]]
Research activities at ARIES cover topics related to the sun, stars and galaxies. ARIES has made significant contributions particularly to the field of star clusters and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). The longitude of ARIES (79° East) locates it in the middle of a 180-degree wide longitude band having modern astronomical facilities lying between the Canary Islands (20° West) and Eastern Australia (157° East).Observations, which are not possible in Canary Islands or Australia due to daylight, can be made at ARIES. Because of its geographical location and existence of good astronomical observation sites, ARIES has made unique contributions to many areas of astronomical research, particularly those involving time critical phenomena (e.g., the first successful attempt in the country to observe optical afterglow of GRBs was carried out from ARIES). A large number of eclipsing binaries, variable stars, star clusters, nearby galaxies, GRBs, and supernova have been observed from ARIES. The other research fields of the institute include solar astronomy, stellar astronomy, star clusters, stellar variability and pulsation, photometric studies of nearby galaxies, Quasars, and transient events like supernovae and highly energetic Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). A total solar eclipse lasting about 4 minutes was successfully observed from Manavgat, Antalya in Turkey on 29 March 2006 by a team of scientists from the Institute.

In past, new ring systems around Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune were discovered from the observatory. Recently, for the first time a direct correlation between the intra-night optical variability and the degree of polarization of the radio jets in Quasars was established based on the observations from ARIES. For the first time periodic oscillations are detected in optical intra day variability data of blazers which is extremely useful to get the blackhole mass of blazers and also provide a strong support to accretion disk based models of AGN.

===Atmospheric Sciences===
Nainital (29.40N; 79.50E, 1958 m amsl) is located at a high altitude in the Central Himalayas and away from urban cities or any major pollution source. This factor makes it very suitable for carrying out observations in background condition and to study the regional environment, particularly interactions between natural and anthropogenic trace species and climate change. Additionally, the ARIES site can also provide information on long range transport of pollutants. Studies on lower atmospheric dynamics are also very important in this region, which is severely lacking over northern India.

==Infrastructure==
The Institute has in-house workshops to meet the requirements of electronic, mechanical, and optical maintenance of the instruments. ARIES has a modern computer center with internet facility and a well maintained library with more than 10,000 volumes of research journals and an excellent collection of books on Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics and Atmospheric Sciences.

{{Forms of government}}
{{Neo-fascism}}

'''Authoritarianism''' is a term [[political scientist]]s use for a worldview that values [[orderliness]] and [[authority]], and distrusts outsiders and [[social change]]. As a form of [[government]], it is characterized by strong central power and limited [[political freedom]]s. Individual economic or personal freedoms are subordinate to the state and there is no constitutional [[accountability]] under an authoritarian regime.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11127424/trump-authoritarianism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11431892/after-trump-how-authoritarian-voters-will-change-american-politics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite book|title=Government and Politics - Volume I|last=Sekiguchi|first=Masashi|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=9781905839698|page=92|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gkm5DAAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 December 2016|date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan Linz]]'s influential 1964 description of authoritarianism&lt;ref&gt;Richard Shorten, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ffbV8ZpQ3MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Modernism and Totalitarianism: Rethinking the Intellectual Sources of Nazism and Stalinism, 1945 to the Present]'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), p. 256 (note 67).&lt;/ref&gt; characterized authoritarian [[political system]]s by four qualities:
# Limited [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], that is such regimes place constraints on political institutions and groups like [[legislature]]s, [[Political party|political parties]] and [[interest group]]s;
# A basis for [[Political legitimacy|legitimacy]] based on emotion, especially the identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat "easily recognizable societal problems" such as [[underdevelopment]] or [[insurgency]]; 
# Minimal [[social mobilization]] most often caused by constraints on the public such as suppression of political opponents and anti-regime activity;
# Informally defined executive power with often vague and shifting powers.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Casper, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZVDjmr18f4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fragile Democracies: The Legacies of Authoritarian Rule], pp. 40–50 (citing Linz 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authoritarian government and states==
===Types===
Linz distinguished new forms of authoritarianism from personalistic dictatorships and totalitarian states, taking [[Francoist Spain]] as an example. Unlike personalistic dictatorships, new forms of authoritarianism have institutionalized representation of a variety of actors (in Spain's case, including the military, the [[Catholic Church]], [[Falange Española y de las JONS|Falange]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]], [[technocrat]]s and others). Unlike totalitarian states, the regime relies on passive mass acceptance rather than popular support.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Landman, ''Studying Human Rights'' (Routledge, 2003), p. 71 (citing Linz 1964 and others).&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars also mention the emergence of a different type of regime - the hybrid regime - in the post-Cold War era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mufti |first1=Mariam |title=What Do We Know about Hybrid Regimes after Two Decades of Scholarship? |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=112 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1400 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1400|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several subtypes of authoritarian regimes have been identified by Linz and others.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"&gt;Mark J. Gasiorowski, [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=uxO2QHFzlZsC |page=105 }} The Political Regimes Project], in ''On Measuring Democracy: Its Consequences and Concomitants'' (ed. Alex Inketes), 2006, pp. 110–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Linz identified the two most basic subtypes as traditional authoritarian regimes and bureaucratic-military authoritarian regimes:
* Traditional authoritarian regimes are those "in which the ruling authority (generally a single person)" is maintained in power "through a combination of appeals to traditional legitimacy, [[Clientelism|patron-client ties]] and repression, which is carried out by an apparatus bound to the ruling authority through personal loyalties". An example is [[Ethiopia]] under [[Haile Selassie&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; 
* Bureaucratic-military authoritarian regimes are those "governed by a [[military junta|coalition of military officers]] and technocrats who act pragmatically (rather than ideologically) within the limits of their bureaucratic mentality."&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; [[Mark J. Gasiorowski]] suggests that it is best to distinguish "simple military authoritarian regimes" from "bureaucratic authoritarian regimes" in which "a powerful group of technocrats uses the state apparatus to try to rationalize and develop the economy" such as [[South Korea]] under [[Park Chung-hee]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;

Linz also has identified three other subtypes of authoritarian regime: [[Corporatism|corporatist]] or organic-statistic, racial and ethnic "democracy" and post-totalitarian.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Corporatist authoritarian regimes "are those in which corporatism institutions are used extensively by the state to coopt and demobilize powerful interest groups". This type has been studied most extensively in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Racial and ethnic "democracies" are those in which "certain racial or ethnic groups enjoy full democratic rights while others are largely or entirely denied those rights", such as in [[South Africa under apartheid]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Post-totalitarian authoritarian regimes are those in which totalitarian institutions (such as the party, [[secret police]] and state-controlled mass media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heinrich |first1=Andreas |last2=Pleines |first2=Heiko |title=The Meaning of 'Limited Pluralism' in Media Reporting under Authoritarian Rule |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=103 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1238 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1238|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) remain, but where "ideological orthodoxy has declined in favor of routinization, repression has declined, the state's top leadership is less personalized and more secure, and the level of mass mobilization has declined substantially".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski" /&gt; Examples include the [[Russian Federation]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Eastern bloc]] states in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;

Authoritarian regimes are also sometimes subcategorized by whether they are personalistic or [[Populism|populist]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Personalistic authoritarian regimes are characterized by arbitrary rule and [[authority]] exercised "mainly through patronage networks and coercion rather than through institutions and formal rules".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Personalistic authoritarian regimes have been seen in post-colonial Africa. By contrast, populist authoritarian regimes "are mobilizational regimes in which a strong, charismatic, manipulative leader rules through a coalition involving key lower-class groups".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Examples include [[Argentina]] under [[Juan Perón|Perón]],&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Egypt under Nasser&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; and [[Venezuela]]  under [[Hugo Chávez|Chávez]] and [[Nicolás Maduro|Maduro]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan de Onis, [http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/juan-de-onis/after-chavez-authoritarianism-still-threatens-latin-america "After Chavez, Authoritarianism Still Threatens Latin America"], ''World Affairs'' (May 15, 2013): "the followers of the late President Hugo Chávez continue to apply the playbook of authoritarian populism throughout Latin America in their pursuit of more power...one of the Mercosur partners are challenging the basic political practices of authoritarian populism implanted in Venezuela."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weyland, [http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/latin-america%E2%80%99s-authoritarian-drift-threat-populist-left "Latin America's Authoritarian Drift: The Threat from the Populist Left"], ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'', Vol. 23, Issue 3 (July 2013), pp. 18–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarianism is characterized by highly concentrated and [[Centralized government|centralized]] power maintained by [[political repression]] and the exclusion of potential challengers. It uses [[Political party|political parties]] and mass organizations to mobilize people around the goals of the regime.&lt;ref name="Vestal"&gt;Theodore M. Vesta, ''[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=XWXtXOl56KkC&amp;c |page=17 }} Ethiopia: A Post-Cold War African State]''. Greenwood, 1999, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Przeworski]] has theorized that "authoritarian equilibrium rests mainly on lies, fear and economic prosperity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Democracy and the Market: Political and Economic Reforms in Eastern Europe and Latin America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Mfjv6snK0-EC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 1991-07-26|isbn = 9780521423359|first = Adam|last = Przeworski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarianism also tends to embrace the informal and unregulated exercise of [[Power (politics)|political power]], a leadership that is "self-appointed and even if elected cannot be displaced by citizens' free choice among competitors", the arbitrary deprivation of [[civil liberties]] and little tolerance for meaningful [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

A range of [[social control]]s also attempt to stifle [[civil society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Jennifer Y. J.|last2=Hsu|first2=Carolyn L.|last3=Hasmath|first3=Reza|date=2016|title=NGO Strategies in an Authoritarian Context, and their Implications for Citizenship: The Case of the People's Republic of China|ssrn=2657187|journal=|location=|publisher=American Sociological Association Annual Meeting (Seattle), August 20–23.|volume=|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while political stability is maintained by control over and support of the [[military|armed forces]], a bureaucracy staffed by the regime and creation of [[allegiance]] through various means of [[socialization]] and indoctrination.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

Authoritarian political systems may be weakened through "inadequate performance to demands of the people".&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; Vestal writes that the tendency to respond to challenges to authoritarianism through tighter control instead of [[adaptation]] is a significant weakness and that this overly rigid approach fails to "adapt to changes or to accommodate growing demands on the part of the populace or even groups within the system".&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; Because the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the state is dependent on performance, authoritarian states that fail to adapt may collapse.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

Authoritarianism is marked by "indefinite political tenure" of the ruler or [[ruling party]] (often in a [[one-party state]]) or other authority.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; The transition from an authoritarian system to a more [[Democracy|democratic]] form of government is referred to as [[democratization]].&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

John Duckitt suggests a link between authoritarianism and [[collectivism]], asserting that both stand in opposition to [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Duckitt | first1 = J. | title = Authoritarianism and Group Identification: A New View of an Old Construct | jstor = 3791588 | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–84 | year = 1989 | doi = 10.2307/3791588  |registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duckitt writes that both authoritarianism and collectivism submerge [[individual rights]] and goals to group goals, expectations and [[Conformity|conformities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kemmelmeier | first1 = M. | last2 = Burnstein | first2 = E. | last3 = Krumov | first3 = K. | last4 = Genkova | first4 = P. | last5 = Kanagawa | first5 = C. | last6 = Hirshberg | first6 = M.

===Authoritarianism and totalitarianism===
{{Revolution sidebar}}

[[Totalitarianism]] is an extreme version of authoritarianism. Authoritarianism primarily differs from totalitarianism in that social and economic institutions exist that are not under governmental control. Building on the work of Yale political scientist Juan Linz, Paul C. Sondrol of the [[University of Colorado at Colorado Springs]] has examined the characteristics of authoritarian and totalitarian dictators and organized them in a chart:&lt;ref name="Sondrol"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Sondrol |first1 = P. C. |title = Totalitarian and Authoritarian Dictators: A Comparison of Fidel Castro and Alfredo Stroessner |journal = Journal of Latin American Studies |volume = 23 |issue = 3 |page = 599 |year = 2009 |doi = 10.1017/S0022216X00015868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sondrol argues that while both authoritarianism and totalitarianism are forms of [[autocracy]], they differ in "key [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]]":
{{quote|(1) Unlike their bland and generally unpopular authoritarian brethren, totalitarian dictators develop a [[charisma]]tic "[[Cult of personality|mystique]]" and a mass-based, pseudo-democratic [[interdependence]] with their followers via the conscious manipulation of a prophetic image.
(2) [[wikt:concomitant|Concomitant]] role conceptions differentiate totalitarians from authoritarians. Authoritarians view themselves as individual beings largely content to control and often maintain the status quo. Totalitarian self-conceptions are largely [[Teleology|teleological]]. The [[tyrant]] is less a person than an indispensable function to guide and reshape the universe.

(3) Consequently, the utilisation of power for personal aggrandizement is more evident among authoritarians than totalitarians. Lacking the binding appeal of [[ideology]], authoritarians support their rule by a mixture of instilling fear and granting rewards to loyal collaborators, engendering a [[kleptocracy]].&lt;ref name="Sondrol"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Compared to totalitarianism, "the authoritarian state still maintains a certain distinction between state and society. It is only concerned with political power and as long as that is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty. Totalitarianism, on the other hand, invades [[private life]] and asphyxiates it".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"&gt;Radu Cinpoes, ''Nationalism and Identity in Romania: A History of Extreme Politics from the Birth of the State to EU Accession'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Another distinction is that "authoritarianism is not animated by utopian ideals in the way totalitarianism is. It does not attempt to change the world and human nature".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt; [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] writes that "a totalist ideology, a party reinforced by a [[secret police]], and monopoly control of ... industrial mass society" are the three features of totalitarian regimes that distinguish them from other autocracies.&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt;

===Authoritarianism and democracy===
{{Individualism sidebar}}
Authoritarianism and democracy are not fundamentally opposed to one another, as it is possible for democracies to possess authoritarian elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frantz |first1=Erica |title=Authoritarian Politics: Trends and Debates |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=87 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1498 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1498|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[illiberal democracy]] (or [[procedural democracy]]) is distinguished from [[liberal democracy]] (or [[substantive democracy]]) in that illiberal democracies lack features such as the [[rule of law]], protections for minority groups and an [[Judicial independence|independent judiciary]].&lt;ref&gt;
* Thomas H. Henriksen, ''American Power after the Berlin Wall'' (Palgrave Macmillan: 2007), p. 199: "experts emphasize that elections alone, without the full democratic panoply of an independent judiciary, free press, and viable political parties, constitute, in reality, illiberal democracies, which still menace their neighbors and destabilize their regions."
*  David P. Forsythe, ''Human Rights in International Relations'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 231: "Illiberal democracies may have reasonably free and fair national elections based on broad suffrage, but they do not counteract the tyranny of the majority with effective protections for ethnic and religious minorities or various types of dissenters."
* Rod Hague &amp; Martin Harrop, ''Political Science: A Comparative Introduction'' (7th ed.: Palgrave Macmillan: 2007), p. 259: "The gradual implementation of the rule of law and due process is an accomplishment of liberal politics, provide a basis for distinguishing liberal from illiberal democracies, and both from authoritarian regimes."
* Vladimir Popov, "Circumstances versus Policy Choices: Why Has the Economic Performance of the Soviet Successor States Been So Poor" in ''After the Collapse of Communism: Comparative Lessons of Transition'' (eds. [[Michael McFaul]] &amp; Kathryn Stoner-Weiss: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 20: "The least efficient institutions are in illiberal democracies combining poor rule of law with democracy ... Less democratic regimes with weak rule of law ... appear to do better than illiberal democracies in maintaining institutional capacity."&lt;/ref&gt;

A further distinction that liberal democracies have rarely made war with one another; research has extended the theory and finds that more democratic countries tend to have few wars (sometimes called [[militarized interstate dispute]]s) causing fewer battle deaths with one another and that democracies have far fewer [[civil war]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

Some commentators, such as [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], believed that low-income authoritarian regimes have certain technocratic "efficiency-enhancing advantages" over low-income democracies, helping authoritarian regimes generate development.&lt;ref name="Halperin"&gt;Morton H.

Weinstein (2005) counter this belief, arguing that the evidence has shown that there is no "authoritarian advantage" and that there is a "democratic advantage" instead.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; Halperin et al. argue that democracies "realize superior development performance" over authoritarianism. They point out that poor democracies are more likely to have steadier economic growth and less likely to experience economic and humanitarian catastrophes than authoritarian regimes; that civil liberties act as a curb on corruption and misuse of resources; and that democracies are more adaptable.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; Halperin point out that the vast majority of refugee crises and financial catastrophes occur in authoritarian regimes.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt;

Studies suggest that several health indicators (life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality) have a stronger and more significant association with democracy than they have with [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita, size of the public sector or income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Franco |first1 = Á. |last2 = Álvarez-Dardet |first2 = C. |last3 = Ruiz |first3 = M.

==Characteristics==
===Systemic weakness and resilience===
[[Andrew J. Nathan]] notes that "regime theory holds that authoritarian systems are inherently fragile because of weak legitimacy, overreliance on coercion, overcentralization of decision making, and the predominance of personal power over institutional norms....Few authoritarian regimes—be they communist, fascist, corporatist, or personalist—have managed to conduct orderly, peaceful, timely, and stable successions".&lt;ref name="NathanAuthoritarian"&gt;Andrew J. Nathan, [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/38546/summary "Authoritarian Resilience"], ''Journal of Democracy'', 14.1 (2003), pp. 6–17.&lt;/ref&gt; One exception to this general trend is the endurance of the authoritarian rule of the [[Chinese Communist Party]], which has been unusually resilient among authoritarian regimes.  Nathan posits that this can be attributed to four factors: (1) "the increasingly norm-bound nature of its succession politics"; (2) "the increase in meritocratic as opposed to factional considerations in the promotion of political elites"; (3) "the differentiation and functional specialization of institutions within the regime"; and (4) "the establishment of institutions for political participation and appeal that strengthen the CCP's legitimacy among the public at large".&lt;ref name="NathanAuthoritarian"/&gt;

===Gender and authoritarianism===
According to a study by Brandt and Henry, there is a direct correlation between the rates of [[gender inequality]] and the levels of authoritarian ideas in the male and female populations. It was found that in countries with less gender equality where individualism was encouraged and men occupied the dominant societal roles, women were more likely to support traits such as obedience which would allow them to survive in an authoritarian environment and less likely to encourage ideas such as independence and imagination. In countries with higher levels of gender equality, men held less authoritarian views. It is theorized that this occurs due to the stigma attached to individuals who question the cultural norms set by the dominant individuals and establishments in an authoritarian society as a way to prevent the psychological stress caused by the active ostracizing of the stigmatized individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark J. |last=Brandt |first2=P. J. |last2=Henry |title=Gender Inequality and Gender Differences in Authoritarianism |year=2012 |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=38 |issue=10 |pages=1301–15 |doi=10.1177/0146167212449871 |pmid=22733982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no precise definition of authoritarianism, but several annual measurements are attempted, including [[Freedom House]]’s annual [[Freedom in the World]] report.

==Historical trends==
===Anti-authoritarianism===
{{Main|Anti-authoritarianism}}
Both [[World War II]] (ending in 1945) and the later [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (1991) resulted in the replacement of authoritarian regimes by either democratic regimes or regimes that were less authoritarian.

[[World War II]] saw the defeat of the [[Axis powers]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]]. All the Axis powers — [[Nazi Germany]], Fascist Italy and the [[Empire of Japan]] — had totalitarian or authoritarian governments, and two of the three were replaced by governments based on democratic constitutions. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] were an alliance of Democratic states and (later) the Communist [[Soviet Union]]. At least in Western Europe the initial post-war era embraced pluralism and freedom of expression in areas that had been under control of authoritarian regimes.  The memory of fascism and nazism was denigrated. The new [[Federal Republic of Germany]] banned its expression.  In reaction to the centralism of the Nazi state, for example, the new constitution of West Germany ([[Federal Republic of Germany]]) exercised "[[separation of powers]]" and  placed "[[Law enforcement in Germany|law enforcement]] firmly in the hands" of the sixteen ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]'' or states of the republic, not with the federal German government (at least not at first).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/topics/security/federal-police/federal-police-node.html The Federal Police]. Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community of Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturally there was also a strong sense of anti-authoritarianism based on [[anti-fascism]] in Western Europe. This was attributed to the active resistance from [[German-occupied Europe|occupation]] and to fears arising from the development of [[superpower]]s.&lt;ref name="swcjsb"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sign Wars: The Culture Jammers Strike Back! |last=Cox |first=David |year=2005 |publisher=LedaTape Organisation |isbn=978-0-9807701-5-5 |page=108 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=zKo8DrmamAwC |page= }} |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-authoritarianism also became associated with [[countercultural]] and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] movements such as the [[Beat Generation]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/beatgeneration.html|title=Retired Site PBS Programs |website=pbs.org|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[hippies]] in the 1960s&lt;ref name="Stonepolitics"&gt;"The way of the hippie is antithetical to all repressive hierarchical power structures since they are adverse to the hippie goals of peace, love and freedom&amp;nbsp;... Hippies don't impose their beliefs on others. Instead, hippies seek to change the world through reason and by living what they believe."{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm "The Way of the Hippy"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Punk subculture|punk]]s in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = McLaughlin | first = Paul | title = Anarchism and Authority | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-7546-6196-2 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South America, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile and Uruguay moved away from dictatorships to democracy between 1982 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The challenge of the past |journal=The Economist |date=22 October 1998 |url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/1998/10/22/the-challenge-of-the-past |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 and [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] in [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991]], the other authoritarian/totalitarian "half" of the Allied Powers of WWII collapsed. This led not so much to revolt against authority in general, but to the belief that authoritarian states (and state control of economies) were outdated. 
&lt;ref name="Tharoor-wapo-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tharoor |first1=Ishaan |title=The man who declared `the end of history` fears for democracy's future |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/09/the-man-who-declared-the-end-of-history-fears-for-democracys-future/?noredirect=on |accessdate=4 October 2018 |agency=Washington Post |date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The idea that "liberal democracy was the final form toward which all political striving was directed",&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; became very popular in Western countries and was celebrated in [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''.&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; According to Charles H. Fairbanks, Jr., "all the new states that stumbled out of the ruins of the Soviet bloc, except Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, seemed indeed to be moving toward democracy in the early 1990s," as where the countries of East Central Europe and the Balkans.&lt;ref name="causes-2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fairbanks, Jr. |first1=Charles H. |title=Causes of Authoritarianism in the Former Soviet Republics |url=https://ge.boell.org/en/2014/01/16/causes-authoritarianism-former-soviet-republics |website=Heinrich Boell Stiftung |accessdate=5 October 2018 |date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2010, the "[[Arab Spring]]" arose in response to unrest over economic stagnation but also in opposition to oppressive authoritarian regimes, first in [[Tunisia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/01/19/uk-tunisia-protests-bouaziziidUKTRE70I7TV20110119|title=Peddler’s martyrdom launched Tunisia’s revolution.

Regimes were toppled in  [[Tunisia]] [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], and [[Yemen]], and other countries saw riots, civil wars or insurgencies.&lt;ref name="NYRB-Ruthven"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruthven|first1=Malise|title=How to Understand ISIS|journal=New York Review of Books|date=23 June 2016|volume=63|issue=11|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/06/23/how-to-understand-isis/|accessdate=12 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807014415/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/06/23/how-to-understand-isis/|archivedate=7 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authoritarian revival===
From 2005 to 2015 observers noted what some called a "democratic recession"&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ignatieff |first1=Michael |title=Are the Authoritarians Winning? |journal=New York Review of Books |date=10 July 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/06/28/hitlers-rise-it-can-happen-here/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitsky-myth"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levitsky |first1=Steven |last2=Way |first2=Lucan |title=The Myth of Democratic Recession |journal=Journal of Democracy |date=January 2015 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=45–58 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Levitsky-26-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although some — Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way — have disputed this theory).&lt;ref name="Levitsky-myth"/&gt; 
In 2018 [[Freedom House]] declared that from 2006 to 2018, "113 countries" around the world showed "a net decline" in "political rights and civil liberties" while "only 62" experienced "a net improvement."&lt;ref name="FH-2018"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom in the World 2018 Democracy in Crisis |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2018 |website=Freedom House |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2018, U.S. political journalist David Frum stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The hopeful world of the very late 20th century—the world of [[NAFTA]] and an expanding [[NATO]]; of the World Wide Web 1.0 and liberal interventionism; of the global spread of democracy under leaders such as [[Václav Havel]] and [[Nelson Mandela]]—now looks battered and delusive."&lt;ref name="Frum-liberalism"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frum |first1=David |title=The Republican Party Needs to Embrace Liberalism |journal=Atlantic |date=November 2018 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/the-case-for-liberal-republicanism/570790/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Explanations offered for the new spread of authoritarianism by supporters include excessive immigration into European and Western countries, and the "primary and existential fear" of the "surrender" by liberal democracy of "national sovereignty and independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=BUCHANAN |first1=PATRICK J. |title=Why the Authoritarian Right is on the Rise, |url=https://www.theamericanconservative.com/buchanan/why-the-authoritarian-right-is-on-the-rise/ |website=American Conservative |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others credit  the downside of globalization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bhagavan |first1=Manu |title=We are witnessing the rise of global authoritarianism on a chilling scale |url=https://qz.com/643497/we-are-witnessing-the-rise-of-global-authoritarianism-on-a-chilling-scale/ |website=Qz.com |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the success of the [[Beijing Consensus]], i.e. the authoritarian model of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="Cowen-2017-success"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |title=China's Success Explains Authoritarianism's Allure |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-03/china-s-success-explains-authoritarianism-s-allure?cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-view |website=Bloomberg |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In at least one country, (the U.S.) factors blamed for the  growth of authoritarianism include the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008]] and slower real wage growth;&lt;ref name="Cowen-2017-why"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |title=Why is authoritarianism on the rise? |url=https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/04/why-is-authoritarianism-on-the-rise.html |website=marginalrevolution.com |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social media's elimination of "gatekeepers" of knowledge, so that a large fraction of the population considers to be opinion what were once "viewed as verifiable facts” – everything from the danger of global warming to the preventing the spread of disease through vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Can it Happen Here? review: urgent studies in rise of authoritarian America (Review of Cass Sunstein book ''Can It Happen Here?: Authoritarianism in America'') |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/07/can-it-happen-here-review-trump-republicans-authoritarian-america-fascism |website=The Guardian |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=8 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Castell Henllys''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]], "castle of the old court") is an important [[archaeology|archaeological]] site in north [[Pembrokeshire]], [[Wales]], between [[Newport, Pembrokeshire|Newport]] and [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]].  

This [[Iron Age]] [[hillfort]] has been the subject of an ongoing excavation for more than twenty years, accompanied by an exercise in [[reconstruction archaeology]] whereby experiments in prehistoric farming have been practised.  Four [[Roundhouse_(dwelling)|roundhouse]]s and a [[granary]] have been reconstructed on their original Iron Age foundations, some 2,000 years old, the only site in Britain where this has been done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Tivyside Advertiser|date=5 July 2018|author=Dave Parkinson|title=Roundhouse built on site of existing Iron Age fort near Cardigan|url=http://www.tivysideadvertiser.co.uk/news/16334564.roundhouse-built-on-site-of-existing-iron-age-fort-near-cardigan/|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer the site acts as a training excavation for young archaeologists. The site is a popular visitor attraction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visit Pembrokeshire: Castell Henllys Iron Age Fort|url=http://www.visitpembrokeshire.com/attractions-events/castell-henllys-iron-age-fort/|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is owned by the [[Pembrokeshire Coast National Park]].

A '''cat organ''' or '''cat piano''' ({{lang-de|Katzenorgel}} or ''Katzenklavier'', {{lang-fr|orgue à chats}} or ''piano à chats/piano chats'') is a hypothetical [[musical instrument]] which consists of a line of [[cat]]s fixed in place with their tails stretched out underneath a [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] so that they [[cat communication|cry out]] when a key is pressed. The cats would be arranged according to the natural [[pitch (music)|tone]] of their voices.

==Origins==

There is no official record of a cat organ actually being built; rather it is described in literature as a bizarre concept. "The details of the cat organ present it clearly as an instrument cat lovers might wish was a fictional horror."&lt;ref name="Betancourt"&gt;Betancourt, Michael (2011). {{Cite web |url=http://vagueterrain.net/content/2011/05/birth-sampling |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602011022/http://vagueterrain.net/content/2011/05/birth-sampling# |archive-date=2013-06-02 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is used in stories which criticize the cruelty of royalty while the [[piganino]], a similar instrument using pigs, has been used to criticize the poor.

This instrument was described by the French writer [[Jean-Baptiste Weckerlin]] in his book ''Musiciana, extraits d’ouvrages rare ou bizarre'' (Musiciana, descriptions of rare or bizarre inventions):&lt;ref&gt;Weckerlin, Jean-Baptiste (1877). ''Musiciana, extraits d'ouvrages rare ou bizarre'', p.349. Paris: Garnier Freres. Cited in {{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=diEVidYxO7cC&amp;pg=PA195 |title=The Tiger In The House |first=Carl|last=Van Vechten|isbn=9781417967445 |date=2004-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When the King of Spain [[Philip II of Spain|Felipe II]] was in [[Brussels]] in 1549 visiting his father the [[Emperor Charles V]], each saw the other rejoicing at the sight of a completely singular procession. At the head marched an enormous bull whose horns were burning, between which there was also a small devil. Behind the bull a young boy sewn into a bear skin rode on a horse whose ears and tail were cut off. Then came the archangel Saint Michael in bright clothing, and carrying a balance in his hand.

The most curious was on a chariot that carried the most singular music that can be imagined. It held a bear that played the organ; instead of pipes, there were sixteen cat heads each with its body confined; the tails were sticking out and were held to be played as the strings on a piano, if a key was pressed on the keyboard, the corresponding tail would be pulled hard, and it would produce each time a lamentable [[meow]]. The historian [[Juan Christoval Calvete]], noted the cats were arranged properly to produce a succession of notes from the octave... ([[chromatic scale|chromatically]], I think).

This abominable orchestra arranged itself inside a theatre where monkeys, wolves, deer and other animals danced to the sounds of this infernal music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weckerlin|first=Jean-Baptiste|authorlink=Jean-Baptiste Weckerlin|title=Musiciana, extraits d’ouvrages rare ou bizarre|location=Paris|date=1877|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The instrument was described by German physician [[Johann Christian Reil]] (1759–1813) for the purpose of treating patients who had lost the ability to focus their attention. Reil believed that if they were forced to see and listen to this instrument, it would inevitably capture their attention and they would be cured: "A fugue played on this instrument--when the ill person is so placed that he cannot miss the expression on their faces and the play of these animals--must bring Lot's wife herself from her fixed state into conscious awareness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uchicago.edu/research/jnl-crit-inq/issues/v24/v24n3.richards.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606101253/http://www.uchicago.edu/research/jnl-crit-inq/issues/v24/v24n3.richards.html# |archive-date=2011-06-06 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df= }} from Richards, Robert J. "Rhapsodies on a Cat-Piano, or [[Johann Christian Reil]] and the Foundations of Romantic Psychiatry", 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The instrument was first described by [[Athanasius Kircher]] in his 1650 work ''Musurgia Universalis'', though the lack of an image may have left doubt in the minds of some writers. (''The New York Times'', for example, has carried an article claiming he described the instrument,&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{Citation | last = Boxer| first = Sarah| title = A Postmodernist Of the 1600s Is Back in Fashion| newspaper = The New York Times | publication-place = New York| date = 25 May 2002| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/25/arts/a-postmodernist-of-the-1600-s-is-back-in-fashion.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another stating he did not describe it in ''Musurgia Universalis''.&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{Citation | last = Schuessler| first = Jennifer| title = A 17th-Century Genius, a Quack, or Perhaps Both | newspaper = The New York Times | publication-place = New York| date = 30 December 2012| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/31/books/a-man-of-misconceptions-by-john-glassie.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;). His description appears in Book 6, Part 4, Chapter 1, under the heading "Corollaria," (emphasis added):

Live cats of all sizes where placed in a box built for this purpose, containing sharp points near the tails so that they struck cats of different sizes, producing different pitches when different keys where pressed. The performance of this frenzy of cat voices in harmony, sometimes in misery, sometimes in anger, caused amusement.}}}}

[[Image:katzenkavalier.jpg|right|250px|thumb|from Gaspar Schott, ''Magia Naturalis'' (1657)]]

The citation is noted by Kircher's student [[Gaspar Schott]] in ''Magia Naturalis naturae et artis,'' Part 2, Book 6, Pragmatia 2, titled "Felium Musicam exhibere [Cat Concert]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gaspar|last=Schott|authorlink=Gaspar Schott|title=Magia universals naturae et artis|date=1657}}: [http://lhldigital.lindahall.org/cdm/ref/collection/philsci/id/20194 Text] and [http://lhldigital.lindahall.org/cdm/ref/collection/philsci/id/20194 Image] at Linda Hall Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern citations and reconstructions==
[[Michael Betancourt]] compares the [[sampling (music)|sampling]] of cats' meows used in [[Jingle Cats]]' albums, ''Meowy Christmas'' (1993) and ''Here Comes Santa Claws'' (1994), to the cat organ,&lt;ref name="Betancourt"/&gt; in that both require cats, but diminish each performer's importance.

Kircher notes that the instrument can be used to reduce the melancholy of princes by moving them to laughter, almost exactly the situation that occurred in 2010 when [[Prince Charles]] was greatly amused by a performance of the tune "[[Over the Rainbow]]" on an instrument recreated using [[squeaky toy]] cats by [[Henry Dagg]] for a [[garden party]] held at [[Clarence House]] supporting Charles's [[Start Initiative|Start]] initiative for sustainable living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11273342 |title=Prince Charles' laughter over 'cat organ' |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1310898/Prince-Charles-interviewed-Daybreak-Adrian-Chiles-Christine-Bleakley.html |title=Please stop, one's sides are splitting! |first=Fay|last=Schlesing |date=11 September 2010 |journal=[[Daily Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, [[The People's Republic of Animation]], a professional animation studio, released an animation titled ''[[The Cat Piano]]''. This work tells the tale of a city of cats whose musicians are kidnapped by a human in order to make a cat piano. This short film has received several awards, as well as nominations for awards. The Academy announced that it was shortlisted for an Oscar for Best Animated Short. However, it was not nominated.

[[Cognitive science]] and [[Theoretical linguistics|linguistic theory]] have played an important role in providing empirical research into the [[writing process]] and serving the teaching of composition. As composition theories, there is some dispute concerning the appropriateness of tying these two schools of thought together into one theory of [[Composition studies|composition]]. However, their empirical basis for research and ties to the process theory of composition and cognitive science can be thought to warrant  some connection.

==Theoretical construct==
The cognitive theory of composition (hereafter referred to as “cognitive theory”) can trace its roots to psychology and cognitive science. [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s and [[Jean Piaget]]'s contributions to the theories of cognitive development and developmental psychology could be found in early work linking these sciences with composition theory (see [[Ann E. Berthoff]]).  [[Linda Flower]] and [[John Hayes (cognitive scientist)|John Hayes]] published “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing” in 1981, providing the groundwork for further research into how thought processes influence the writing process.

[[Linguistics|Linguistic]] theories of composition found their roots in the debate surrounding [[grammar]]'s importance in composition pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;Hartwell, Patrick. "Grammar, Grammars, and the Teaching of Grammar." [[College English]] 47.2 (1985): 105-127. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars, such as [[Janet Emig]], [[Patrick Hartwell]], [[Martha J. Kolln]], Robert Funk, [[Stephen Witte]], and [[Lester Faigley]] continued this line of thought around the same time that a cognitive theory of composition was being developed by Flower and Hayes. These scholars, like scholars researching cognitive-oriented composition theory, focused on research providing insight into the writing process, but were also committed to providing pedagogical advancements addressing deficiencies, trends, and insights gained from their linguistic research.

==Research==

===Cognitive Theory===
A cognitive theory is focused on gaining insight into the writing process through the writer’s thought processes. Composition theorists have attacked the problem of accessing writers’ thoughts in various ways. Flower and Hayes’  essay, “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing” sought to outline the writer’s choice-making throughout the writing process, and how those choices constrained or influenced other choices down the line.&lt;ref&gt;Flower, Linda, and John R. Hayes. "A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing." College Composition and Communication 32.4 (1981): 365-387. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has focused on capturing the cognitive processes of writers during the writing process through note-taking or speaking aloud,&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, Anne M., and Barbara M. Sitko. Hearing Ourselves Think: Cognitive Research in the College Writing Classroom. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; while some early research by Birdwell, Nancrow, and Ross was done with computers to record writers’ keystrokes during the writing process.

===Applied Linguistics===
Linguistic composition theory has traditionally focused on sentence and paragraph-level composition, with the goal of providing instructors insights into the way students write at various proficiency levels. Stephen Witte and Lester Faigley&lt;ref&gt;Faigley, Lester, and Stephen P. Witte. "Coherence, Cohesion, and Writing Quality." College Composition and Communication 32.2 (1981): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; utilized detailed [[syntactic]] analysis to redefine the importance of [[cohesion (linguistics)|cohesion]] and [[coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] in judging writing quality. Paul Rodgers&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, Paul Jr. C. "A Discourse-centered Rhetoric of the Paragraph." College Composition and Communication 17.1 (1966): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Braddock&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, Richard. "The Frequency and Placement of Topic Sentences in Expository Prose." Research in the Teaching of English 8.3 (1974): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; focused on paragraph structure, in separate studies, in order to dispel common misjudgments about the importance of traditional paragraph structure.

Applied linguistics, specifically [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL/ESL]] studies, has played a large role in development linguistic theories of composition. Liz Hamp-Lyons’ research in ESL/EFL [[writing assessment]] is valuable in informing ESL composition pedagogy. [[Paul Kei Matsuda]],&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul Kei. "Composition Studies and ESL Writing: A Disciplinary Division of Labor." College Composition and Communication 50.4 (1999): 699-721.&lt;/ref&gt;  has illustrated the deficiency in ESL composition research, and recent compilations by Matsuda and others&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul Kei, Michelle Cox, and Jay Jordan. Second-language Writing in the Composition Classroom: A Critical Sourcebook. New York: Bedford / St. Martin's, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; have attempted to bridge the gap between ESL instruction and composition theory by presenting pedagogical, theoretical, and assessment frameworks in the ESL composition classroom.

==Pedagogy==
Cognitive and linguistic theories of composition are heavily tied to [[process theory]]. Cognitive and linguistic theories have been instrumental in providing respected empirical research to the field of [[Composition studies|composition theory]], but tend to stay away from making pedagogical suggestions. Instead, research in these fields is typically intended to inform process theory by providing data analysis regarding the writing process, and by bringing scientific research to the field.

'''Collaborative leadership''' is a management practice which is focused on leadership skills across functional and organizational boundaries.

==Term Exploration==
The phrase collaborative leadership first appeared in the mid-1990s in response to the twin trends of growth in [[strategic alliance]]s between private corporations, and the formation of long-term [[public private partnership]] contracts to rebuild [[public infrastructure]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Kurt Lewin was first to apply cooperative system in scientific method in 1947 about individual nutrition in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Abdolhamid, A. (2016). School principals’ collaborative leadership style and relation it to teachers’ self-efficacy. International Journal of Research Studies in Education, Vol 5, Iss 3, Pp 3-12 (2016), (3), 3. doi:10.5861/ijrse.2015.1218.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1994 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article "Collaborative Advantage", [[Rosabeth Moss Kanter]] addressed leaders who recognize that critical business relationships exist "that cannot be controlled by formal systems but require (a) dense web of interpersonal connections".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rosabeth Moss Kanter on the Frontiers of Management|first=Rosabeth Moss |last=Kanter|journal=Harvard Business Review|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|year=2003|isbn=1-59139-323-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their book published that same year, Chrislip and Larson looked at the attributes of great civic leaders in communities across the US and found some similar attributes. "Collaboration needs a different kind of leadership; it needs leaders who can safeguard the process, facilitate interaction and patiently deal with high levels of frustration"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Collaborative Leadership Fieldbook - A guide for citizens and civic leaders|first=David|last=Chrislip|publisher=Josey Bass|year=2002|isbn=0-7879-5719-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2013, ''Harvard Business Review''&lt;ref name=HBR&gt;{{cite web | url=https://hbr.org/2013/02/why-the-world-needs-tri-sector.html | title=Why the World Needs Tri-Sector Leaders | work=Harvard Business Review | date=February 13, 2013 | accessdate=July 22, 2016 | author=Nick Lovegrove|author2=Matthew Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; authors [[Nick Lovegrove]] and Matthew Thomas (co-founders of The InterSector Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intersector.com/ The InterSector Project]&lt;/ref&gt;), explore the complex relationship between the business, government and social sectors as it relates to said sectors role in addressing society's most pressing challenges; issues such as managing resource constraints, controlling health care costs, training the twenty-first-century workforce, developing and implementing smart-grid and intelligent-urbanization technologies, and stabilizing financial systems to foster sustainable economic growth.  Their research suggests that the future of collaborative leadership depends on the ability of leaders to engage and collaborate with the business, government and social sectors (see below for the distinguishing characteristics of such leaders).&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;

Hank Rubin author and founder of the Institute for Collaborative Leadership has written "A collaboration is a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to accomplish a shared outcome." In his book ''Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools,'' Rubin asks "Who is a collaborative leader?" and answers "You are a collaborative leader once you have accepted responsibility for building - or helping to ensure the success of - a heterogeneous team to accomplish a shared purpose . Your tools are (1) the purposeful exercise of your behavior, communication, and organizational resources in order to affect the perspective, beliefs, and behaviors of another person (generally a collaborative partner) to influence that person's relationship with you and your collaborative enterprise and (2) the structure and climate of an environment that supports the collaborative relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools|last1=Rubin|first1=Hank|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4129-6544-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubin and Brock distinguish collaborative leadership from collective impact, defining the latter as "...(beginning) when we, as a community, agree to a set of shared outcomes and then, individually, return to our home organizations and work with our staffs, boards, and volunteers to figure out what we - individually and organizationally - can best do to achieve those shared goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/opinion/guest-column/2017/03/01/rochester-monroe-anti-poverty-effort-more-than-collaboration/98603876/|title=Rochester-Monroe anti-poverty effort more than collaboration|last=Brock {{!}} Rubin|first=Leonard {{!}} Hank|date=March 5, 2017|work=Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative leadership is how we align and integrate across organizations.

David Archer and Alex Cameron, in their 2008 book ''Collaborative Leadership: How to succeed in an interconnected world'', identify the basic objective of the collaborative leader as the delivery of results across boundaries between different organisations. They say "Getting value from difference is at the heart of the collaborative leader's task... they have to learn to share control, and to trust a partner to deliver, even though that partner may operate very differently from themselves."&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collaborative leadership – how to succeed in and interconnected world|first1=David|last1=Archer|first2=Alex|last2=Cameron|publisher=Butterworth Heinemann|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7506-8705-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Providing further exploration, in his 2015 book ''Enabling Collaboration – Achieving Success Through Strategic Alliances and Partnerships'' {{ISBN|9780986079337}}, Martin Echavarria argues that Collaborative Leadership is  the result of individual collaborative leadership capability, as well as group leadership. In this respect, he argues that individuals can support and contribute to collaboration and do so from a leadership point of view; but at the group level, where collaboration can be behaviorally experienced. Echavarria cites the work of [[Enrique Pichon-Rivière]], who developed the Operative Group method for working with groups, [[Wilfred Bion]] an influential British psychoanalyst, [[Kurt Lewin]] and others and describes the Operative Partnership Methodology for coaching teams to collaborate (an issue which is addressed vis-a-vis strategic alliances in said publication.&lt;ref&gt;Echavarria, Martin, (2015). Enabling Collaboration – Achieving Success Through Strategic Alliances and Partnerships. LID Publishing Inc. {{ISBN|9780986079337}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of collaborative leaders==
There have been a number of research projects and reviews of key lessons learned for collaborative leaders.

Nick Lovegrove and Matthew Thomas, writing for the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'',&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt; interviewed over 100 leaders who possess a demonstrated ability to engage and collaborate across the business, government and social sectors.  The authors identified six major, distinguishing characteristics:&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;

# Balanced motivations. A desire to create public value no matter where they work, combining their motivations to wield influence (often in government), have social impact (often in nonprofits) and generate wealth (often in business)
# Transferable skills. A set of distinctive skills valued across sectors, such as quantitative analytics, strategic planning and stakeholder management
# Contextual intelligence. A deep empathy of the differences within and between sectors, especially those of language, culture and key performance indicators
# Integrated networks. A set of relationships across sectors to draw on when advancing their careers, building top teams, or convening decision-makers on a particular issue
# Prepared mind. A willingness to pursue an unconventional career that zigzags across sectors, and the financial readiness to take potential pay cuts from time to time
# Intellectual thread. Holistic subject matter expertise on a particular intersector issue by understanding it from the perspective of each sector

[[Madeline Carter]], writing for the [[Center for Effective Public Policy]] as part of a research project funded by the [[United States Department of Justice]] and [[State Justice Institute]], defines five qualities of a collaborative leader:&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Madeline M. (2006). ''[http://www.collaborativejustice.org/docs/The%20Importance%20of%20Collaborative%20Leadership.pdf The Importance of Collaborative Leadership in Achieving Effective Criminal Justice Outcomes]''. Center for Effective Public Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Willingness to take risks
# Eager listeners
# Passion for the cause
# Optimistic about the future
# Able to share knowledge, power and credit

Archer and Cameron list ten key lessons for successful collaborative leaders:&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;

*Find the ''personal'' motive for collaborating
*Find ways of simplifying complex situations for your people
*Prepare for how you are going to handle conflict well in advance
*Recognize that there are some people or organisations you just can't partner with
*Have the courage to act for the long term
*Actively manage the tension between focusing on delivery and on building relationships
*Invest in strong personal relationships at all levels
*Inject energy, passion and drive into your leadership style
*Have the confidence to share the credit generously
*Continually develop your interpersonal skills, in particular: empathy, patience, tenacity, holding difficult conversations, and coalition building.

Rod Newing writing in a ''[[Financial Times]]'' supplement special report says "If a collaboration is to be effective, each party must recognise and respect the different culture of the other". And traditional development paths don't prepare leaders well for this "traditional management development, is based on giving potential managers a team of people and a set of resources to control – and success is rewarded with more people and more resources to control. By contrast, collaboration requires managers to achieve success through people and resources outside their control and for this they have had no preparation".{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Steven Wilson mentions in “Collaborative leadership: it’s good to talk,” four major key leadership traits that all highly collaborative leaders share:
* Focus on authentic leadership; placing the goals of the organization ahead of their own self-interest and following through on their commitments
* Relentlessly pursue transparent decision making clear how their decisions are made and who is accountable for the outcomes
* View resources as instruments of action; realizing shared goals through the flexible use of shared resources
* Clarify the relationship between decisions, rights, accountability and rewards; taking time to establish decision paths and a common vocabulary that everyone can comprehend for successful collaborations
Chantale Mailhot, Stephanie Gagnon, Anne Langley and Louis-Felix Binitte did a research project to examine the qualities of distributing leadership and the effects diversity has on groups. They found that "coupling of leaders and objects helped to maintain the worldview of the different groups involved at different levels in the research project, while directing them towards project objectives".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In retrospect, the differences of each individual increases innovation due to the variety of minds at work. With everyone having their own qualities and prior experiences, the integration between them in a leadership role contributes to the overall experience. In this study, the case was made that collaborative leadership has many benefits and is more practical than just one person solely having the role as the leader.

The best thing a collaborative leader can do is to lead by example. They have to ‘walk the talk’, and be seen to model the right behaviors. Leaders must show a willingness take risks, continually question their own ideas, and reward others for their clear communication and valuable insights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=50202a11-e515-462e-b046-643cdfe41aa7@sessionmgr103&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=114|title=Collaborative leadership: it's good to talk.: ".Start Your Research"|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The need for collaborative leadership is being recognised in more and more areas;
#[[Public Private Partnership]]s
#Global [[Supply Chain]]s
#Civic collaboration to solve complex community problems
#On-line collaboration – [[Linux]], [[Wikipedia]] etc.
#Political collaboration to tackle global issues such as the [[Financial crisis of 2007-2008|credit crunch]], [[Global warming|climate change]] and terrorism
#The Government-  According to Heather Getha-Taylor and Ricardo S. Morse as part of their article, collaborative leadership has an impact on the roles of local government officials. It is said that public administration is shifting to a more collaborative leadership oriented field, because it helps with the set of skills necessary for the jobs.&lt;ref&gt;GETHA-TAYLOR, H., &amp; MORSE, R. S. (2013). COLLABORATIVE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS: EXPLORING COMPETENCIES AND PROGRAM IMPACT. Public Administration Quarterly, (1). 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Education- According to Abdolhamid Arbabi and Vali Mehdinezhad collaborative leadership adds to cooperation which allows for adaptability and consistency. It “increases organizational commitment and decreases employee resistance to changes.” There is a significant correlation between the teachers self-efficiency and the principles style of collaborative leadership. According to Gialamas, Pelonis, and Medeiros collaborative leadership allows for leaders to work together. It allows for a better adaptability to change which in turn allows for “growth and development.”&lt;ref&gt;Arbabi, A., &amp; Mehdinezhad, V. (2015). The relationship between the school principals' collaborative leadership style and teachers' self-efficacy. ''Palestrica Of The Third Millennium Civilization &amp; Sport'', ''16''(2), 125-131.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Health Services- According to Markle-Reid, Dykeman, Ploeg, Stradiotto, Andrews, Bonomo, &amp; Stradiotto, collaborative leadership in the Health area will allow for a more widespread set of skills required to help the patients. An example brought up is the idea that the elderly do not receive the help they require because of the fact that the people do not know how to react in the given case. They know what to do, but when confronted by the situation they do not know how to act. Collaborative leadership will allow for the skills necessary as well as a uniform set of actions they must follow.&lt;ref&gt;Markle-Reid, M., Dykeman, C., Ploeg, J., Stradiotto, C. K., Andrews, A., Bonomo, S., &amp; ... Kelly Stradiotto, C. (2017). Collaborative leadership and the implementation of community-based fall prevention initiatives: a multiple case study of public health practice within community groups. ''BMC Health Services Research'', ''17''1-12. doi:10.1186/s12913-017-2089-3&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[Ipsos MORI]] research report published in 2007 found that relationship management and collaborative leadership were the top two qualities or capabilities that Directors of organisations involved in large business partnerships would have liked to have had more access to when setting up or running a partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socia.co.uk/knowledge/Research.aspx|title=Business Partnerships Survey|year=2007|publisher=Ipsos MORI|accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16380">'''Cyber-collection''' refers to the use of [[cyber-warfare]] techniques in order to conduct [[espionage]].  Cyber-collection activities typically rely on the insertion of [[malware]] into a targeted network or computer in order to scan for, collect and exfiltrate sensitive information.

Cyber-collection started as far back as 1996, when widespread deployment of [[Internet connectivity]] to government and corporate systems gained momentum.  Since that time, there have been numerous cases of such activity.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;Pete Warren, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/30/state-sponsored-cyber-espionage-prevalent State-sponsored cyber espionage projects now prevalent, say experts]'', The Guardian, August 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimesfin"&gt;Nicole Perlroth, ''[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/elusive-finspy-spyware-pops-up-in-10-countries/ Elusive FinSpy Spyware Pops Up in 10 Countries]'', New York Times, August 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AolTech"&gt;Kevin G. Coleman, ''[http://gov.aol.com/2012/07/02/has-stuxnet-duqu-and-flame-ignited-a-cyber-arms-race/ Has Stuxnet, Duqu and Flame Ignited a Cyber Arms Race?]'', AOL Government, July 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the state sponsored examples, cyber-collection has also been used by organized crime for identity and e-banking theft and by corporate spies.  [[Operation High Roller]] used cyber-collection agents in order to collect PC and smart-phone information that was used to electronically raid bank accounts.&lt;ref name="HighRoller"&gt;Rachael King, ''[https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2012/06/26/operation-high-roller-targets-corporate-bank-accounts/ Operation High Roller Targets Corporate Bank Accounts]'', June 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Rocra]], aka Red October, collection system is an "espionage for hire" operation by organized criminals who sell the collected information to the highest bidder.&lt;ref name="CrunchOctober"&gt;Frederic Lardinois, ''[https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/21/eugene-kaspersky-and-mikko-hypponen-talk-red-october-and-the-future-of-cyber-warfare-at-dld/ Eugene Kaspersky And Mikko Hypponen Talk Red October And The Future Of Cyber Warfare At DLD]'', TechCrunch, January 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SundayOctober"&gt;Mark Prigg, ''[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2263322/Operation-Red-October-revealed-The-astonishing-hacker-attack-infiltrated-55-000-high-level-government-computers.html The hunt for Red October: The astonishing hacking ring that has infiltrated over 1,000 high level government computers around the world]'', Daily Mail, January 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platforms and functionality==
Cyber-collection tools have been developed by governments and private interests for nearly every computer and smart-phone operating system.  Tools are known to exist for Microsoft, Apple, and Linux computers and iPhone, Android, Blackberry, and Windows phones.&lt;ref name="BloomFinFisher"&gt;Vernon Silver, ''[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-29/spyware-matching-finfisher-can-take-over-iphone-and-blackberry.html Spyware Matching FinFisher Can Take Over IPhones]'',, Bloomberg, August 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Major manufacturers of [[Commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) cyber collection technology include Gamma Group from the UK&lt;ref name="finfisher"&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120731073430/http://www.finfisher.com/FinFisher/en/index.php FinFisher IT Intrusion]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hacking Team]] from Italy.&lt;ref name="hackingteam"&gt;[http://www.hackingteam.it/index.php/remote-control-system Hacking Team, Remote Control System]&lt;/ref&gt; Bespoke cyber-collection tool companies, many offering COTS packages of [[Zero-day attack|zero-day]] exploits, include [[Endgame, Inc.]] and Netragard of the United States and Vupen from France.&lt;ref name="iw"&gt;Mathew J. Schwartz, ''[https://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/weaponized-bugs-time-for-digital-arms-co/240008564 Weaponized Bugs: Time For Digital Arms Control]'', Information Week, 9 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  State intelligence agencies often have their own teams to develop cyber-collection tools, such as [[Stuxnet]], but require a constant source of ''zero-day exploits'' in order to insert their tools into newly targeted systems.  Specific technical details of these attack methods often sells for six figure sums.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;Ryan Gallagher, ''[http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/01/zero_day_exploits_should_the_hacker_gray_market_be_regulated.html Cyberwar’s Gray Market]'', Slate, 16 Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Common functionality of cyber-collection systems include:
*''Data scan'': local and network storage are scanned to find and copy files of interest, these are often documents, spreadsheets, design files such as Autocad files and system files such as the passwd file.
*''Capture location'': GPS, WiFi, network information and other attached sensors are used to determine the location and movement of the infiltrated device
*''[[Covert listening device|Bug]]'': the device microphone can be activated in order to record audio.  Likewise, audio streams intended for the local speakers can be intercepted at the device level and recorded.
* ''Hidden Private Networks'' that bypass the corporate network security.  A compute that is being spied upon can be plugged into a legitimate corporate network that is heavy monitored for malware activity and at same time belongs to a private wifi network outside of the company network that is leaking confidential information off of an employee's computer.  A computer like this is easily set up by a double-agent working in the IT department by install a second Wireless card in a computer and special software to remotely monitor an employee's computer through this second interface card without them being aware of a side-band communication channel pulling information off of his computer.
*''Camera'': the device cameras can be activated in order to covertly capture images or video.   
*''[[Keylogger]] and Mouse Logger'': the malware agent can capture each keystroke, mouse movement and click that the target user makes.  Combined with screen grabs, this can be used to obtain passwords that are entered using a virtual on-screen keyboard.
*''Screen Grabber'': the malware agent can take periodic screen capture images.  In addition to showing sensitive information that may not be stored on the machine, such as e-banking balances and encrypted web mail, these can be used in combination with the key and mouse logger data to determine access credentials for other Internet resources. 
*''Encryption'': Collected data is usually encrypted at the time of capture and may be transmitted live or stored for later exfiltration.  Likewise, it is common practice for each specific operation to use specific encryption and poly-morphic capabilities of the cyber-collection agent in order to ensure that detection in one location will not compromise others.
*''Bypass Encryption'': Because the malware agent operates on the target system with all the access and rights of the user account of the target or system administrator, encryption is bypassed.  For example, interception of audio using the microphone and audio output devices enables the malware to capture to both sides of an encrypted Skype call.&lt;ref name="Milan"&gt;Daniele Milan, [http://www.comm.rtaf.mi.th/Sitedirectory/124/3148/3148_2_6-Daniele-Milan.pdf The Data Encryption Problem], Hacking Team&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Exfiltration'': Cyber-collection agents usually exfiltrate the captured data in a discrete manner, often waiting for high web traffic and disguising the transmission as secure web browsing.  [[USB flash drive]]s have been used to exfiltrate information from [[Air gap (networking)|air gap]] protected systems.  Exfiltration systems often involve the use of reverse proxy systems that anonymize the receiver of the data.&lt;ref name="FlameUSB"&gt;Robert Lemos, ''[https://www.infoworld.com/t/malware/flame-stashes-secrets-in-usb-drives-195455 Flame stashes secrets in USB drives]'', InfoWorld, June 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Replicate'': Agents may replicate themselves onto other media or systems, for example an agent may infect files on a writable network share or install themselves onto USB drives in order to infect computers protected by an [[Air gap (networking)|air gap]] or otherwise not on the same network.
*''Manipulate Files and File Maintenance'': Malware can be used to erase traces of itself from log files.  It can also download and install modules or updates as well as data files.  This function may also be used to place "evidence" on the target system, e.g. to insert child pornography onto the computer of a politician or to manipulate votes on an electronic vote counting machine.
*''Combination Rules'': Some agents are very complex and are able to combine the above features in order to provide very targeted intelligence collection capabilities.  For example, the use of GPS bounding boxes and microphone activity can be used to turn a smart phone into a smart bug that intercepts conversations only within the office of a target.
*''Compromised cellphones''. Since, modern cellphones are increasingly similar to general purpose computer, these cellphones are vulnerable to the same cyber-collect attacks as computer systems, and are vulnerable to leak extremely sensitive conversational and location information to an attackers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elgj2ZFMZDE how to spy on a cell phone without having access]&lt;/ref&gt;  Leaking of cellphone GPS location and conversational information to an attacker has been reported in a number of recent [[cyber stalking]] cases where the attacker was able to use the victim's GPS location to call nearby businesses and police authorities to make false allegations against the victim depending on his location, this can range from telling the restaurant staff information to tease the victim, or making false witness against the victim.  For instance if the victim were parked in large parking lot the attackers may call and state that they saw drug or violence activity going on with a description of the victim and directions to their GPS location.

==Infiltration==
There are several common ways to infect or access the target:
*An ''[[Injection Proxy]]'' is a system that is placed upstream from the target individual or company, usually at the Internet service provider, that injects malware into the targets system.  For example, an innocent download made by the user can be injected with the malware executable on the fly so that the target system then is accessible to the government agents.&lt;ref name="Gloor"&gt;Pascal Gloor, ''[http://www.swinog.ch/meetings/swinog25/p/02_(Un)Lawful%20Intercept%202012-11-07%20SwiNOG25.pdf (Un)lawful Interception] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205065155/http://www.swinog.ch/meetings/swinog25/p/02_%28Un%29Lawful%20Intercept%202012-11-07%20SwiNOG25.pdf |date=2016-02-05 }}'', SwiNOG #25, 07 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Phishing|Spear Phishing]]'': A carefully crafted e-mail is sent to the target in order to entice them to install the malware via a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]] document or a [[Drive-by download|drive by attack]] hosted on a web server compromised or controlled by the malware owner.&lt;ref name="SpearTechWeb"&gt;Mathew J. Schwartz, ''[https://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/operation-red-october-attackers-wielded/240146621 Operation Red October Attackers Wielded Spear Phishing]'', Information Week, January 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Black bag operation|Surreptitious Entry]]'' may be used to infect a system.  In other words, the spies carefully break into the target's residence or office and install the malware on the target's system.&lt;ref name="blackbagfbi"&gt;FBI Records: The Vault, ''[http://vault.fbi.gov/Surreptitious%20Entries%20%28Black%20Bag%20Jobs%29%20/ Surreptitious Entries]'', Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/ref&gt;
*An ''Upstream monitor'' or ''[[Packet analyzer|sniffer]]'' is a device that can intercept and view the data transmitted by a target system.  Usually this device is placed at the Internet service provider.  The [[Carnivore (software)|Carnivore]] system developed by the U.S. [[FBI]] is a famous example of this type of system.  Based on the same logic as a [[Lawful Interception|telephone intercept]], this type of system is of limited use today due to the widespread use of encryption during data transmission.  
*A ''wireless infiltration'' system can be used in proximity of the target when the target is using wireless technology.  This is usually a laptop based system that impersonates a WiFi or 3G base station to capture the target systems and relay requests upstream to the Internet. Once the target systems are on the  network, the system then functions as an ''Injection Proxy'' or as an ''Upstream Monitor'' in order to infiltrate or monitor the target system.
*A ''[[USB flash drive|USB Key]]'' preloaded with the malware infector may be given to or dropped at the target site.

Cyber-collection agents are usually installed by payload delivery software constructed using [[0-day attack|zero-day]] attacks and delivered via infected USB drives, e-mail attachments or malicious web sites.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Zetter, ''[http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/29/tech/web/iran-spyware-flame/index.html "Flame" spyware infiltrating Iranian computers]'', CNN - Wired, May 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DutchUSB"&gt;Anne Belle de Bruijn, ''[http://www.elsevier.nl/Tech/nieuws/2012/7/Cybercriminelen-doen-poging-tot-spionage-bij-DSM-ELSEVIER343610W/ Cybercriminelen doen poging tot spionage bij DSM]'', Elsevier, July 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  State sponsored cyber-collections efforts have used official operating system certificates in place of relying on security vulnerabilities.  In the Flame operation, [[Microsoft]] states that the Microsoft certificate used to impersonate a [[Windows Update]] was forged;&lt;ref name="MSCertForged"&gt;Mike Lennon, ''[https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-unauthorized-certificate-was-used-sign-flame-malware Microsoft Certificate Was Used to Sign "Flame" Malware] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307131239/http://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-unauthorized-certificate-was-used-sign-flame-malware |date=2013-03-07 }}'', June 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; however, some experts believe that it may have been acquired through [[HUMINT]] efforts.&lt;ref name="MSCertStolen"&gt;Paul Wagenseil, ''[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47675971/ns/technology_and_science-security/t/flame-malware-uses-stolen-microsoft-digital-signature/ Flame Malware Uses Stolen Microsoft Digital Signature]'', NBC News, June 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1289">In [[computability theory]] a '''cylindrification''' is a construction that associates a [[cylindric numbering]] to each [[numbering (computability theory)|numbering]]. The concept was first introduced by [[Yuri L. Ershov]] in 1973.

== Definition ==

Given a numbering &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; the '''cylindrification''' &lt;math&gt;c(\nu)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Domain}(c(\nu)) := \{\langle n, k \rangle | n \in \mathrm{Domain}(\nu)\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c(\nu)\langle n, k \rangle := \nu(i)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\langle n, k \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Cantor pairing function]].
The cylindrification operation takes a relation as input of arity k and outputs a relation of arity k + 1 as follows : Given a relation R of arity K, its cylindrification denoted by c(R), is the following set {(a1,...,ak,a)|(a1,...,ak)belongs to R and a belongs to A}. Note that the cylindrification operation increases the arity of an input by 1.

== Properties ==
* Given two numberings &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\nu \le \mu \Leftrightarrow c(\nu) \le_1 c(\mu)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\nu \le_1 c(\nu)&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Nozzle de Laval diagram.svg|right|thumb|250px|Diagram of a de Laval nozzle, showing approximate flow velocity (v), together with the effect on temperature (T) and pressure (p)]]
A '''de Laval nozzle''' (or '''convergent-divergent nozzle''', '''CD nozzle''' or '''con-di nozzle''') is a tube that is pinched in the middle, making a carefully balanced, asymmetric [[hourglass]] shape. It is used to accelerate a hot, pressurized [[gas]] passing through it to a higher [[supersonic]] speed in the axial (thrust) direction, by converting the heat energy of the flow into [[kinetic energy]]. Because of this, the [[nozzle]] is widely used in some types of [[steam turbines]] and [[rocket engine nozzle]]s. It also sees use in supersonic [[jet engines]].

Similar flow properties have been applied to [[Jet (fluid)|jet streams]] within [[astrophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= C.J. Clarke and B.

This principle was first used in a [[rocket engine]] by [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]]. Most modern rocket engines that employ hot gas combustion use de Laval nozzles.

==Operation==

Its operation relies on the different properties of gases flowing at [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] and [[supersonic]] speeds. The speed of a subsonic flow of gas will increase if the pipe carrying it narrows because the [[mass flow rate]] is constant. The gas flow through a de Laval nozzle is [[Isentropic process#Isentropic flow|isentropic]] (gas [[entropy]] is nearly constant). In a subsonic flow [[sound]] will propagate through the gas. At the "throat", where the cross-sectional area is at its minimum, the gas velocity locally becomes sonic (Mach number = 1.0), a condition called [[choked flow]]. As the nozzle cross-sectional area increases, the gas begins to expand and the gas flow increases to supersonic velocities where a sound wave will not propagate backwards through the gas as viewed in the frame of reference of the nozzle ([[Mach number]] &gt; 1.0).

==Conditions for operation==

A de Laval nozzle will only choke at the throat if the pressure and mass flow through the nozzle is sufficient to reach sonic speeds, otherwise no supersonic flow is achieved, and it will act as a [[Venturi tube]]; this requires the entry pressure to the nozzle to be significantly above ambient at all times (equivalently, the [[stagnation pressure]] of the jet must be above ambient).

In addition, the pressure of the gas at the exit of the expansion portion of the exhaust of a nozzle must not be too low. Because pressure cannot travel upstream through the supersonic flow, the exit pressure can be significantly below the [[ambient pressure]] into which it exhausts, but if it is too far below ambient, then the flow will cease to be [[supersonic]], or the flow will separate within the expansion portion of the nozzle, forming an unstable jet that may "flop" around within the nozzle, producing a lateral thrust and possibly damaging it.

In practice, ambient pressure must be no higher than roughly 2–3 times the pressure in the supersonic gas at the exit for supersonic flow to leave the nozzle.

==Analysis of gas flow in de Laval nozzles==

The analysis of gas flow through de Laval nozzles involves a number of concepts and assumptions:

* For simplicity, the gas is assumed to be an [[ideal gas]].
* The gas flow is [[Isentropic process#Isentropic flow|isentropic]] (i.e., at constant [[entropy]]). As a result, the flow is [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] (frictionless and no dissipative losses), and [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] (i.e., there is no heat gained or lost).
* The gas flow is constant (i.e., steady) during the period of the [[propellant]] burn.
* The gas flow is along a straight line from gas inlet to [[exhaust gas]] exit (i.e., along the nozzle's axis of symmetry)
* The gas flow behaviour is [[compressible flow|compressible]] since the flow is at very high [[velocities]] (Mach number &gt; 0.3).

==Exhaust gas velocity==

As the gas enters a nozzle, it is moving at [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] velocities. As the throat contracts, the gas is forced to accelerate until at the nozzle throat, where the cross-sectional area is the smallest, the axial velocity becomes [[mach number|sonic]]. From the throat the cross-sectional area then increases, the gas expands and the axial velocity becomes progressively more [[supersonic]].
  
The linear velocity of the exiting exhaust gases can be calculated using the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/th_nozz.html Richard Nakka's Equation 12.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.braeunig.us/space/propuls.htm#intro Robert Braeuning's Equation 1.22.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George P. Sutton| title=Rocket Propulsion Elements: An Introduction to the Engineering of Rockets|edition=6th|pages=636| publisher=[[Wiley-Interscience]]|year=1992|isbn=0-471-52938-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v_e = \sqrt{\frac{TR}{M} \cdot \frac{2\gamma}{\gamma - 1} \cdot \left[1 - \left(\frac{p_e}{p}\right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}\right]},&lt;/math&gt;

!align=right|&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= absolute pressure of inlet gas.
|}

Some typical values of the exhaust gas velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; for rocket engines burning various propellants are:

* 1,700 to 2,900&amp;nbsp;m/s (3,800 to 6,500&amp;nbsp;mph) for liquid [[monopropellant]]s,
* 2,900 to 4,500&amp;nbsp;m/s (6,500 to 10,100&amp;nbsp;mph) for liquid [[bipropellant]]s,
* 2,100 to 3,200&amp;nbsp;m/s (4,700 to 7,200&amp;nbsp;mph) for [[solid rocket|solid propellant]]s.

As a note of interest, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is sometimes referred to as the ''ideal exhaust gas velocity'' because it based on the assumption that the exhaust gas behaves as an ideal gas.

As an example calculation using the above equation, assume that the propellant combustion gases are: at an absolute pressure entering the nozzle ''p''&amp;nbsp;= 7.0 MPa and exit the rocket exhaust at an absolute pressure ''p''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.1 MPa; at an absolute temperature of ''T'' = 3500 K; with an isentropic expansion factor ''γ'' = 1.22 and a molar mass ''M''&amp;nbsp;= 22&amp;nbsp;kg/kmol. Using those values in the above equation yields an exhaust velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 2802&amp;nbsp;m/s, or 2.80&amp;nbsp;km/s, which is consistent with above typical values.

The technical literature can be very confusing because many authors fail to explain whether they are using the universal gas law constant ''R'', which applies to any [[ideal gas]], or whether they are using the gas law constant ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', which only applies to a specific individual gas.  The relationship between the two constants is ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''R/M''.

'''Differential centrifugation''' is a common procedure in [[microbiology]] and [[Cell biology|cytology]] used to separate certain [[organelle]]s from whole [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s for further analysis of specific parts of cells. In the process, a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] sample is first [[Lysis|lysed]] to break the [[cell membrane]]s and mix up the cell contents. The lysate is then subjected to repeated [[centrifugation]]s, where density separation causes a sediment to form known as "pellet".  After each centrifugation the pellet is removed and the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] is increased. Finally, purification may be done through [[equilibrium sedimentation]], and the desired layer is extracted for further analysis.

== Theory ==
In general the [[equilibrium sedimentation]] profile is a function of particle-density alone; however, in a viscous fluid the &lt;i&gt;rate&lt;/i&gt; of sedimentation is also a function of particle size.  The reason for this is that (for a given radius of rotation and rotational velocity), the centrifugal force on a particle is proportional to the particle diameter cubed (for a given particle-density), whereas the force from viscous drag (or Stoke's force) is only proportional to the particle diameter squared.  This means that larger particles sediment more quickly and at lower centrifugal forces, potentially causing a sedimentation profile that may be distorted by particle sizes and not quite in equilibrium with density.  For this reason, multiple centrifugation steps are used in the separation process in order to obtain sedimentation profiles that are closer to having an equilibrium with density.  

As an example, unbroken whole cells will pellet at low speeds and short intervals such as 1,000g for 5 minutes. Smaller cell fragments and organelles remain in the [[supernatant]] and require more force and longer durations to pellet. In general, one can enrich for the following cell components, in the separating order in actual application:
*Whole cells and nuclei;
*Mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, and peroxisomes;
*Microsomes (vesicles of disrupted endoplasmic reticulum); and
*Ribosomes and cytosol.


High g-force makes sedimentation of small particles much faster than [[Brownian motion|Brownian]] [[diffusion]], even for very small particles. When a centrifuge is used, [[Stokes' law]] must be modified to account for the variation in g-force with distance from the center of rotation. 

:&lt;math&gt; D = \sqrt{ \frac{18 \eta \, \ln(R_f/R_i)}{( \rho_p - \rho_f) \omega^2 t} } &lt;/math&gt;

where
* D is the minimum diameter of the particles expected to sediment (m)
* η (or µ) is the fluid [[dynamic viscosity]] (Pa.s)
* R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the final [[radius of rotation]] (m)
* R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial radius of rotation (m)
* ρ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is particle volumetric mass density (kg/m³)
* ρ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the fluid volumetric mass density (kg/m³)
* ω is the [[angular velocity]] (radian/s)
* t is the time required to sediment from R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; (s)

==Sample preparation==
{{See also|Homogenization (biology)}}

Before differential centrifugation can be carried out to separate different portions of a cell from one another, the tissue sample must first be lysed. In this process, a [[blender (device)|blender]], usually a piece of porous [[porcelain]] of the same shape and dimension as the container, is used. The container is, in most cases, a [[glass]] [[boiling tube]].

The tissue sample is first crushed and a [[buffer solution]] is added to it, forming a liquid suspension of crushed tissue sample. The buffer solution is a [[density|dense]], [[Chemically inert|inert]], [[aqueous solution]] which is designed to suspend the sample in a liquid medium without damaging it through [[chemical reaction]]s or [[osmosis]]. In most cases, the solution used is [[sucrose]] solution; in certain cases [[brine]] will be used. Then, the blender, connected to a high-speed rotor, is inserted into the container holding the sample, pressing the crushed sample against the wall of the container.

With the rotator turned on, the tissue sample is ground by the porcelain pores and the container wall into tiny fragments. This grinding process will break the cell membranes of the sample's cells, leaving individual organelles suspended in the solution. This process is called cell lysis. A portion of cells will remain intact after grinding and some organelles will be damaged, and these will be catered for in the later stages of centrifugation.

==Ultracentrifugation==
The lysed sample is now ready for centrifugation in an [[ultracentrifuge]]. An ultracentrifuge consists of a refrigerated, low-pressure chamber containing a rotor which is driven by an electrical motor capable of high speed rotation. Samples are placed in tubes within or attached to the rotor. Rotational speed may reach up to 100,000 rpm for floor model, 150,000 rpm for bench-top model (Beckman Optima Max-XP or Sorvall MTX150), creating centrifugal speed forces of 800,000g to 1,000,000g. This force causes [[sedimentation]] of macromolecules, and can even cause non-uniform distributions of small molecules.

Since different fragments of a cell have different sizes and densities, each fragment will settle into a pellet with different minimum centrifugal forces. Thus, separation of the sample into different layers can be done by first centrifuging the original lysate under weak forces, removing the pellet, then exposing the subsequent supernatants to sequentially greater centrifugal fields. Each time a portion of different density is sedimented to the bottom of the container and extracted, and repeated application produces a rank of layers which includes different parts of the original sample. Additional steps can be taken to further refine each of the obtained pellets.

Sedimentation depends on mass, shape, and [[partial specific volume]] of a macromolecule, as well as solvent density, rotor size and rate of rotation. The sedimentation velocity can be monitored during the experiment to calculate [[molecular weight]].
Values of [[sedimentation coefficient]] (S) can be calculated. Large values of S (faster sedimentation rate) correspond to larger molecular weight. Dense particle sediments more rapidly. Elongated proteins have larger frictional coefficients, and sediment more slowly to ensure accuracy.

'''Ecotoxicity''', the subject of study of the field of [[ecotoxicology]] (a [[portmanteau]] of [[ecology]] and [[toxicology]]), refers to the potential for [[biological]], [[chemical]] or physical [[stressor]]s to affect [[ecosystems]]. Such stressors might occur in the natural environment at densities, concentrations or levels high enough to disrupt the natural biochemistry, physiology, behavior and interactions of the living organisms that comprise the ecosystem.

Ecotoxicology has been defined as, "the branch of toxicology concerned with the study of toxic effects, caused by natural or synthetic pollutants, to the constituents of ecosystems, animal (including human), vegetable and microbial, in an integral context".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Truhaut R | year = 1977 | title = Eco-Toxicology - Objectives, Principles and Perspectives | url = | journal = Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 151–173 | doi=10.1016/0147-6513(77)90033-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common environmental toxicants == 
# [[Diethyl phthalate]], that enter environments through industries manufacturing cosmetics, plastic and many other commercial products.
# [[Bisphenol A]] (BPA), found in many mass-produced products such as, medical devices, food packaging, cosmetics, children's toys, computers, CD's, etc.
# Pharmaceuticals such as [[Climbazole]], a fungicide found in [[anti-dandruff shampoo]]s.
# [[Pesticide]]s
# Some but not all; [[Cleaning agent|cleaning products]], [[laundry detergent]]s, [[fabric softener]]s, [[oven cleaner]]s, [[disinfectant]]s
# [[Phosphate]]s
# [[Oil]]

== Everyday hazards ==

In Canada, there is no law requiring manufactures to state the health and [[environmental hazard]]s associated with their cleaning products. Many people buy such products to support a clean and healthy home, often unaware of the products ability to harm both their own health and the surrounding environment. "Canadians spend more than $275 million on household [[cleaning product]]s in a year" &lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://davidsuzuki.org/issues/health/science/toxics/the-dirt-on-toxic-chemicals-in-household-cleaning-products/ |title=The dirt on toxic chemicals in household cleaning products |last=Suzuki |first=David |publisher= The David Suzuki Foundation |date=  |website=David Suzuki Foundation, Solutions are in our nature |access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemicals from these cleaners enter our bodies through air passageways and [[skin absorption|absorption through the skin]] and when these cleaning products are  washed down the drain they negatively affect [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. There are also no regulations in place stating that the ingredients be listed on labels of cleaning products leading the users to be ultimately unaware of the chemicals they expose themselves and their surrounding environments to.

=== 2-Butoxyethanol === 
The organic compound [[2-Butoxyethanol]], commonly found in [[glass cleaner]]s, laundry [[stain remover]]s, windshield wiper fluid, [[oven cleaner]]s, and [[rust remover]]s has been proven to cause [[reproductive problems]] in laboratory experiments.

=== Ammonia === 
The compound [[ammonia]] is found in many window cleaners, drain cleaners, bathroom cleaners, oven cleaners, [[car polish]], and all-purpose cleaners. Its vapour is particularly harmful to people with [[asthma]] and it may also cause kidney and [[liver damage]]. When ammonia is mixed with products containing [[chlorine bleach]], highly poisonous [[chloramine]] gas is formed. This poisonous gas often forms when cleaners are mixed in the home forming strong irritants.

=== Fragrance chemicals ===

[[Fragrance]] chemicals are found in most cleaning products, perfumes, and [[personal care]] products. More than 3000 chemicals are used in these fragrance mixtures. The synthetic musks used in [[detergent]]s accumulate in the environment and are harmful to aquatic organisms. Certain musks are possible [[endocrine disruptor]]s that interfere with hormone functioning. Phthalates are a common ingredient in these fragrance mixtures found in laundry detergents and fabric softeners. These phthalates are suspected endocrine disrupters that affect reproduction rates including reduced sperm count in males. Certain glass cleaners and floor polishes contain dibutyl phthalate (DBP). The European Union classifies DBP as very toxic to aquatic organisms, posing a huge danger as these cleaners, especially the floor polishes are often rinsed down the drain and into aquatic environments.

=== Phosphates ===

[[Phosphates]] are found in many dishwasher detergents, laundry detergents, and bathroom cleaners. They act as a fertilizer in water and in high concentrations can promote algae blooms and increase weed growth. When water containing phosphates are washed into water areas they carry with them [[fertilizer]]s, nutrients, and wastes from the land. [[Phytoplankton]] and algae flourish at the surface due to increased phosphates. Dead phytoplankton and other organisms sink to the bottom giving rise to large numbers of decomposers due to increased food supply (dead organisms, phytoplankton). Due to the increased number of decomposers that use more oxygen, fish and shrimp at the lower layers of the ocean become oxygen-starved and [[hypoxic zone]]s become apparent.

=== Quaternary ammonium compounds (quats) ===

[[Quats]] are [[anti-microbial]] agents that are found in bathroom cleaners, [[fabric softener]]s, and degreasers. They are a class of irritants and [[Allergy|sensitizers]] that negatively affect people who suffer from asthma. Chemicals in this class are persistent in aquatic environments, and toxic to the organisms that live in these environments. Many researchers are concerned that their widespread use in everyday household [[disinfectant]]s and cosmetics are contributing to [[antibiotic resistant]] bacteria, thus limiting microbial infection treatment options.

===Trisodium nitrilotriacetate===

Trisodium [[nitrilotriacetate]] is found in bathroom cleaners and possibly some laundry detergents although more actively used in industrial formulations. Small amounts add up in the environment and add to an overall toxic issue. In aquatic ecosystems these chemicals cause [[heavy metal (chemical element)|heavy metals]] in [[sediment]] to redisolve and many of these metals are toxic to fish and other wildlife.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"/&gt;

== Plasticizers ==
[[Phthalates]] and [[Bisphenol A|BPA]] date back to the 1920s and 1930s. Phthalates have been applied as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) additives since 1926, but were also used for health care purposes as [[insect repellent]]s and [[cercaricides]]. BPA is present in most aquatic environments, entering water systems through [[landfill]]s and [[sewage treatment plant]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] allowing for [[bioaccumulation]] in aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=Oehlmann2009&gt;{{cite journal|author = Oehlmann, J. | author2 = Oehlmann, U.S. | author3 = Kolas, W. | author4 = Jagnytsch, O. |author5=Lutz, I. | author6 = Kusk, K.O. | author7 = Wollenberger, L. | author8 = Santos E.M. | author9 = Paull, G.C. | author10 = Van Look, K.J.W. | author11 = Tyler, C.R. | date = 2009| title = A critical analysis of the biological impacts of plasticizers on wildlife. |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume= 364| issue = | pages = 2047–2062 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0242 | pmid=19528055 | pmc=2873012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These endocrine disrupters are a large group of chemicals that enter into the aquatic environment through the manufacturing of various industrial and consumer products, agriculture and food/drug processing, waste water treatment plants and human wastes. Phthalate esters are common additives that soften and make PVC more flexible.&lt;ref name=Barse2007&gt;{{cite journal|author = Barse, A. V.| author2 = Chakrabarti, T. | author3 = Ghosh, T.K. | author4 = Pal, A.K. |author5=Jadhao, S.B.| date = 2007| title = Endocrine disruption and metabolic changes following exposure of Cyprinus carpio to diethyl phthalate |journal= Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology |volume= 88| issue = | pages = 36–42 | doi=10.1016/j.pestbp.2006.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in many everyday items such as medical devices, packaging for fragrances and cosmetics, ropes and varnishes, in plastic used to wrap food, and shower curtains. These Phthalate esters have been found in areas of water, air, sediment, and in gulfs and rivers around the world, Giam et al. as cited by.&lt;ref name="Barse2007"/&gt; Phalates and BPA affect reproduction in animal groups such as Molluscs, crustaceans, amphibians and fish. Most of these plasticizers affect hormone systems, and some phthalates have even larger pathways of disruption. Phthalates and BPA have been proven to affect development and reproduction in a variety of species. Disturbances include changes in the number of offspring produced and reduced hatching success. In amphibians for example, phthalates and BPA disrupt thyroid functioning which in turn impacts larval development. Molluscs, crustaceans and amphibians appear to be more responsive than fish, with most effects being induced in low concentration ranges with the exception of disrupted [[spermatogenesis]] in fish in the low range.&lt;ref name="Oehlmann2009"/&gt; 
A Phthalate referred to as [[diethyl phthalate]] (DEP) enters the aquatic environment through industries that manufacture cosmetics, plastics and many commercial products that pose hazards to aquatic organisms and human health. Through exposing an adult male common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) to [[LC50]] doses it was evident that a bioaccumulation of DEP in testis, liver, brain, gills and muscle tissue was present. Fish exposed to 20 ppm of DEP became drowsy and discolored during the onset of the fourth week.&lt;ref name="Barse2007"/&gt; 
Sources of DEP contamination and accumulation in humans include cosmetic products and dietary meat of fish, Persky et al.&lt;ref name="Barse2007"/&gt; This DEP acts as a cosmetic ingredient and vehicle for fragrances, both which come in contact with the skin. 
Many countries around the world including India practice sewage fed fisheries where waste waters are used for the purpose of culturing fish. Endocrine disruption and a presence of phthalate residue is highly likely to be observable in these sewage fed fish. This is the case as waste water from various industries and garbage containing DEP are released into these waters. Through a DEP treatment with [[Cyprinus carpio]], liver size was observed to increase and testis size decreased. In fish, muscle ALT and AST activities decreased as it was effected by DEP treatment.  Like many toxic chemicals DEP has been known to affect metabolic enzyme profiles and activities of phosphatases and transaminases, Ghorpade et al. as cited by.&lt;ref name="Barse2007"/&gt; A decrease in immunity of [[M. rosenbergii]] after exposure to DEP was also noted. 
Given that biological effect concentrations for plasticizers used in the laboratory coincide with concentrations present in the environment, it seems that some wildlife species must be negatively impacted.

== Personal hygiene products ==
Personal care products can reach the environment through drainage from waste water treatment plants and digested sludge. Recently, the anti-dandruff and [[antimycotic]], [[Climbazole]], was detected in waste water treatment drainages. Climbazole is readily used in cosmetics, and is an ingredient in anti-dandruff shampoos. Shampoos contain formulations of up to 2.0% which is the equivalent of approximately 15g/L. Climbazole is classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. It affects the growth of green algae [[Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata]] at very low concentrations. [[Zebrafish]] experienced lethal effects after exposure to climbazole in laboratory testing. Effects included thickening of fertilized eggs, lack of somite formation, lack of detachment of the tail bud from the yolk sac, and lack of a heartbeat were evaluated after 48 hours.&lt;ref name=Richter2013&gt;{{cite journal|author = Richter, E. | author2 = Wick, A. | author3 = Ternes, T.A. | author4 = Coors, A. | date = 2013| title = Ecotoxicity of Climbzole, a fungicide contained in Antridandruff shampoo. |journal= Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry  |volume= 32| issue = | pages = 2816–2825 | doi=10.1002/etc.2367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Danio rerio]], [[Lemna minor]], [[Navicula pelliculosa]], Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and [[Daphnia magna]] were tested and all were found to be negatively affected by climbazole in a concentration-dependant manner with highest toxicity observed in L. minor. Effects included stunted colony growth and darkening in color. Effects of climbazole on [[oats]] and [[turnip]] included retarded, stunted growth of the leaves and shoot as well as turning darker in color. The aquatic ecotoxicity of climbazole can be classified as very toxic to Lemna and algae, toxic to fish and harmful to Daphnia.&lt;ref name="Richter2013"/&gt;

== Pesticides == 
[[Pesticides]] often pose serious problems as they kill not only targeted organisms but also non-targeted organisms in the process. They are released into the natural environment intentionally by people who are often unaware that the chemicals will travel further than anticipated, Hatakeyama et al. as cited in.&lt;ref name=Hanazato2001&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hanazato T. | date = 2001 | title = Pesticide effects on freshwater zooplankton: an ecological perspective | url = | journal = Environmental Pollution  | volume = 112 | issue = 1| pages = 1–10 | doi=10.1016/s0269-7491(00)00110-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the pesticides largely affect the natural communities in which they are used. They negatively effect multiple levels ranging from molecules to tisues to organs to individuals to populations and onto communities. In the natural environment, a combination of pesticide exposure and natural stressors such as fluctuating temperature, food shortage or decreased oxygen availability are worse than when presented alone. Pesticides can affect the feeding rates of zoo-plankton. In the presence of pesticides zoo-plankton display lower feeding rates which result in reduced growth and reproduction. Swimming may also be affected by pesticides which poses a life-threatening issue for zoo-plankton as they swim to obtain food and nutrients and avoid predators. Such changes may alter predator-prey relationships. A spinning behavior became apparent in Daphnia induced by carbaryl which increased the probability of the Daphnia being eaten by other fish, Dodson et al. as cited by.&lt;ref name="Hanazato2001"/&gt; The toxicant [[pentachlorophenol]] increases swimming speed in the rotifer [[Brachionus calyciflorus]], in turn increasing the encounter rate of the prey with their predators, Preston et al. as cited by.&lt;ref name="Hanazato2001"/&gt;

== Oil spills == 
One of the major environmental impacts of oil exploration on the environment is the contamination of aquatic ecosystems from [[oil spill]]s and oil seepages from pits. Oftentimes, as is the case in the [[Ecuadorian Amazon]], oil is used to control [[dust]] on roadways, causing the precipitation [[surface runoff|runoff]] from these roads to also be contaminated. Direct human health hazards occur since many people, including children walk barefoot on these oiled roads putting them in direct contact with the crude oil. Other hazards to humans include [[seepage]]s into ponds that provide drinking water for the population. 
During the exploration for oil, mud that has been drilled is deposited into pits. These production pits are often not lined risking the possibility for contaminants to leak into the surrounding environment. Environmental concerns are primarily focused on a group of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs). “PAHs accumulate on particles and sediments, which tend to protect them from biodegrading processes", Green and Trett as cited in.&lt;ref name=Wernersson2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wernersson A.S. | date = 2004 | title = Aquatic ecotoxicity due to oil pollution in the Ecuadorian Amazon. | url = | journal = Aquatic Ecosystem Health &amp; Management | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 127–136 | doi=10.1080/14634980490281470}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the exploration for oil, mud that has been drilled is deposited into pits. These production pits are often not lined risking the possibility for contaminants to leak into the surrounding environment. 
Samples were collected from four sites (13 stations) in the Ecuadorian Amazon where crude oil was the main pollutant. The water collected from Site B, a drinking water pond located 100m from an in use pit, had the highest [[total petroleum hydrocarbon]] (THP) concentration. Sediments were found to be acutely [[phototoxic]]. This area which has poorly developed infrastructure is one where residents collect water for drinking, cooking and bathing from the rivers and ponds nearby. “A recent study observed excess [[cancer rate]]s in a village in this region” Sebastian et. Al, as cited in.&lt;ref name="Wernersson2004"/&gt; Not only were excess cancer rates apparent but many people in this area that were consuming the water for drinking purposes became ill.
In Wernersson’s study, toxicity of water and sediment samples were studied on Daphnia magna (a crustacean zoo-plankton species) and [[Hyalella azteca]] (an amphipod). These samples were collected from four sites where crude oil was the main source of pollution. 1-4 day old organisms of both species were used in the tests. Immobility of D. magna was recorded after 24 hours of exposure indoors. They were then moved outdoors where they were exposed to sunlight. After 1–2 hours the samples were removed from the sunlight and it was found that D. Magna often recovered within an hour after UV exposure.
Hyalella azteca was cultured in the same medium as was used for the D. Magna species. To minimize stress shade was provided. 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness were provided. [[Lethality]] was recorded after 96 hours of exposure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7452">'''Ethnic history''' is a branch of [[social history]] that studies ethnic groups and immigrants. Barman (2007) argues that the field allows historians to use alternate models of interpretation, unite qualitative and quantitative data, apply sociological models to historical patterns, examine more deeply macro-level policies and decisions, and, especially, empathize with the ethnic groups under study.

==Defining the field==
Ethnic history is especially important in the U.S. and Canada. [[Oscar Handlin]] (b. 1915), the director of scores of PhD dissertations at Harvard University was an important pioneer and sponsor of ethnic historiography. Handlin's Pulitzer-prize-winning interpretation, ''[[The Uprooted]]'' (1951) was highly influential.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Handler and Mary F. Handler, "The New History and the Ethnic Factor in American Life," ''Perspectives in American History,'' 1970, Vol. 4, pp 5-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Major encyclopedias have helped define the field; Handler sponsored one published by Harvard University Press in 1980 that received wide media attention because it tied in with an American interest in their roots.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=npQ6Hd3G4kgC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul R.  Magocsi, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Canada's peoples'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dbUuX0mnvQMC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Perin (1983) looks at the historiography of Canadian ethnic history and finds two alternative methodologies. One is more static and emphasizes how closely immigrant cultures replicate the Old World. This approach tends to be filiopietistic. The alternative approach has been influenced by the recent historiography on labor, urban, and family history. It sees the immigrant community as an essentially North American phenomenon and integrates it into the mainstream of Canadian culture.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Perin, "Clio as Ethnic: The Third Force in Canadian Historiography," ''Canadian Historical Review,'' Dec 1983, Vol. 64 Issue 4, pp441-467&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jason J. McDonald|McDonald]] (2007) identifies five main areas of interest for scholarship on U.S. ethnic history: the origins and meaning of ethnicity, particularly the issue of whether it is inherited or invented; the origins of ethnic diversity (such as conquest, immigration, involuntary migration); models of ethnic adaptation (especially the [[Melting pot|Melting Pot]], [[Cultural mosaic|mosaic]], [[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]] and kaleidoscope metaphors); ethnic incorporation into the social, economic, and political fabric of the receiving country; and minority group survival strategies, including responses to competing forms of allegiance like class and gender.&lt;ref&gt;Jason McDonald. ''American Ethnic History: Themes and Perspectives''. (2007), {{ISBN|978-0-8135-4227-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much research is done by reading the letters immigrants wrote to relatives back home, often comparing the advantages and disadvantages of their new lives.&lt;ref&gt;Walter D. Kamphoefner, "Immigrant Epistolary and Epistemology: On the Motivators and Mentality of Nineteenth-Century German Immigrants." ''Journal of American Ethnic History'' (2009): 34-54. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40543427 in JSTOR], on deep-reading their letters&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant trend has been to integrate ethnic history with other new historiographical tendencies, such as [[Atlantic history]],&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, ''British Identities before Nationalism: Ethnicity and Nationhood in the Atlantic World, 1600-1800'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; [[labor history (discipline)|labor history]] or [[women's history]].

A '''European Study Group with Industry (ESGI)''' is usually a week-long meeting where applied mathematicians work on problems presented by industry and research centres. The aim of the meeting is to solve or at least make progress on the problems.

The study group concept originated in Oxford, in 1968 (initiated by [[Leslie Fox]] and [[Alan B Tayler|Alan Tayler]]). Subsequently, the format was adopted in other European countries to form ESGIs. Currently, with a variety of names, they appear in the same or a similar format throughout the world. More specific topics have also formed the subject of focussed meetings, such as the environment, medicine and agriculture.

Problems successfully tackled at study groups are discussed in a number of textbooks as well as a collection of case studies, European Success Stories in Industrial Mathematics. A guide for organising and running study groups is provided by the [[:fr:European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry|European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry]].

== European Study Group with Industry ==

A European Study Group with Industry or ESGI is a type of workshop where mathematicians work on problems presented by industry representatives. The meetings typically last five days, from Monday to Friday. On the Monday morning the industry representatives present problems of current interest to an audience of applied mathematicians. Subsequently, the mathematicians split into working groups to investigate the suggested topics. On the Friday solutions and results are presented back to the industry representative. After the meeting a report is prepared for the company, detailing the progress made and usually with suggestions for further work or experiments.

== History ==

The original Study Groups with Industry started in Oxford in 1968. The format provided a method for initiating interaction between universities and private industry which often led to further collaboration, student projects and new fields of research (many advances in the field of free or moving boundary problems are attributed to the industrial case studies of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=C.M.|last2=Ockendon|first2=J.R.|title=Weak and variational methods for free and moving boundary problems|date=1982|publisher=Pitman Publishing|isbn=0-273-08503-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Study groups were later adopted in other countries, starting in Europe and then spreading throughout the world. The subject areas have also diversified, for example the Mathematics in Medicine Study Groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maths-in-medicine.org/|title=Mathematics in Medicine Study Groups|last=|first=|date=|website=Mathematics in Medicine Study Groups|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematics in the Plant Sciences Study Groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpib.ac.uk/outreach/mpssg/|title=Mathematics in the Plant Sciences Study Group|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the environment, uncertainty quantification and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maths-in-industry.org/past/|title=Mathematics in Industry {{!}} Past Study Groups|last=Bentahar|first=K.|website=www.maths-in-industry.org|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academics work on the problems for free. The following have been given as motivation for this work:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wits.ac.za/conferences/misgsa2016/|title=South African Maths in Industry Study Group|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Discovering new problems and research areas with practical applications.
# The possibility of further projects and collaboration with industry.
# The opportunity for future funding.

A number of reasons have also been quoted for companies to attend ESGIs:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://miis.maths.ox.ac.uk/how/|title=Maths in Industry Information Service, How|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The possibility of a quick solution to their problem, or at least guidance on a way forward.
# Mathematicians can help to identify and correctly formulate a problem for further study.
# Access to state-of-the-art techniques.
# Building contacts with top researchers in a given field.

ESGIs are currently an activity of the European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ECMI|title=European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry|url=https://ecmiindmath.org/|website=European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ESGI webpage &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ECMI ESGI|title=Study Groups|url=https://ecmiindmath.org/study-groups/|website=Study Groups|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains details of European meetings and contact details for prospective industry or academics participants. The current co-ordinator of the ESGIs is Prof. Tim Myers of the [[Centre de Recerca Matemàtica|Centre de Recerca Matemática]], Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre de Recerca Matemática|url=http://www.crm.cat||website=CRM|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2015 and 2019 ESGIs are eligible for funding through the COST network MI-Net (Maths for Industry Network).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathematics for Industry Network|url=https://mi-network.org/|website=MI-Net|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002''' ('''FISMA''', {{usc|44|3541}}, ''et seq.'') is a [[United States federal law]] enacted in 2002 as Title III of the [[E-Government Act of 2002]] ({{USPL|107|347}}, {{USStat|116|2899}}). The act recognized the importance of [[information security]] to the economic and national security interests of the United States.&lt;ref name="nist_overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma/overview.html |title=NIST: FISMA Overview |publisher=Csrc.nist.gov |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act requires each [[Government agency#Government agencies in the United States|federal agency]] to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide program to provide [[information security]] for the information and [[information systems]] that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another agency, [[Government contractor|contractor]], or other source.&lt;ref name="nist_overview"/&gt;

FISMA has brought attention within the federal government to [[cybersecurity]] and explicitly emphasized a "risk-based policy for cost-effective security."&lt;ref name="nist_overview"/&gt; FISMA requires agency program officials, chief information officers, and inspectors general (IGs) to conduct annual reviews of the agency's information security program and report the results to [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB). OMB uses this data to assist in its oversight responsibilities and to prepare this annual report to Congress on agency compliance with the act.&lt;ref name="omb"&gt;FY 2005 Report to Congress on Implementation of The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In FY 2008, federal agencies spent $6.2 billion securing the government's total information technology investment of approximately $68 billion or about 9.2 percent of the total information technology portfolio.&lt;ref name="omb08"&gt;FY 2008 Report to Congress on Implementation of The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

This law has been replaced by the [[Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014]] ({{USPL|113|283}}), sometimes known as FISMA2014 or FISMA Reform. FISMA2014 struck subchapters II and III of chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, amending it with the text of the new law in a new [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/chapter-35/subchapter-II subchapter II] ({{usc|44|3551}}). 

==Purpose of the act==

FISMA assigns specific responsibilities to [[Government agency#Government agencies in the United States|federal agencies]], the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) and the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) in order to strengthen information security systems. In particular, FISMA requires the head of each agency to implement policies and procedures to cost-effectively reduce information technology security risks to an acceptable level.&lt;ref name="omb"/&gt;

According to FISMA, the term ''information security'' means protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide integrity, confidentiality and availability.

==Implementation of FISMA==

In accordance with FISMA, [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] is responsible for developing standards, guidelines, and associated methods and techniques for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, excluding national security systems. NIST works closely with federal agencies to improve their understanding and implementation of FISMA to protect their information and information systems and publishes standards and guidelines which provide the foundation for strong information security programs at agencies. NIST performs its statutory responsibilities through the Computer Security Division of the Information Technology Laboratory.&lt;ref name="nist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov |title=NIST Computer Security Division 2008 report |publisher=Csrc.nist.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIST develops standards, metrics, tests, and validation programs to promote, measure, and validate the security in information systems and services. NIST hosts the following:
* FISMA implementation project&lt;ref name="nist_overview"/&gt;
* [[Information Security Automation Program]] (ISAP)
* [[National Vulnerability Database]] (NVD) – the U.S. government content repository for ISAP and [[Security Content Automation Protocol]] (SCAP). NVD is the U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data. This data enables automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance (e.g., FISMA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nvd.nist.gov/ |title=National Vulnerability Database |publisher=Nvd.nist.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compliance framework defined by FISMA and supporting standards==
FISMA defines a framework for managing information security that must be followed for all [[information system]]s used or operated by a U.S. federal government agency in the executive or legislative branches, or by a contractor or other organization on behalf of a federal agency in those branches. This framework is further defined by the standards and guidelines developed by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]].&lt;ref name="fisma"&gt;The 2002 Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inventory of information systems===
FISMA requires that agencies have an information systems inventory in place.
According to FISMA, the head of each agency shall develop and maintain an inventory of major information systems (including major national security systems) operated by or under the control of such agency&lt;ref name="fisma"/&gt;
The identification of information systems in an inventory under this subsection shall include an identification of the interfaces between each such system and all other systems or networks, including those not operated by or under the control of the agency.&lt;ref name="fisma"/&gt; The first step is to determine what constitutes the "[[information system]]" in question. There is not a direct mapping of computers to an information system; rather, an information system may be a collection of individual computers put to a common purpose and managed by the same system owner. NIST SP 800-18, Revision 1, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems&lt;ref name="nist-sp-800-18"&gt;NIST SP 800-18, Revision 1, "Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems"&lt;/ref&gt; provides guidance on determining [[system]] boundaries.

===Categorize information and information systems according to risk level===
All information and information systems should be categorized based on the objectives of providing appropriate levels of information security according to a range of risk levels&lt;ref name="fisma"/&gt;
The first mandatory security standard required by the FISMA legislation, [[FIPS 199]] "Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems"&lt;ref name="Catalog of FIPS publications"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html |title=Catalog of FIPS publications |publisher=Csrc.nist.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides the definitions of security categories. The guidelines are provided by NIST SP 800-60 "Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html |title=Catalog of NIST SP-800 publications |publisher=Csrc.nist.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall FIPS 199 system categorization is the "high water mark" for the impact rating of any of the criteria for information types resident in a system.  For example, if one information type in the system has a rating of "Low" for "confidentiality," "integrity," and "availability," and another type has a rating of "Low" for "confidentiality" and "availability"  but a rating of "Moderate" for "integrity," then the impact level for "integrity" also becomes "Moderate".

===Security controls===
Federal information systems must meet the minimum security requirements.&lt;ref name="fisma"/&gt; These requirements are defined in the second mandatory security standard required by the FISMA legislation, [[FIPS 200]] "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems".&lt;ref name="Catalog of FIPS publications"/&gt;
Organizations must meet the minimum security requirements  by selecting the appropriate security controls and assurance requirements as described in [[NIST Special Publication 800-53]], "Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems". The process of selecting the appropriate security controls and assurance requirements for organizational information systems to achieve adequate security is a multifaceted, risk-based activity involving management and operational personnel within the organization.
Agencies have flexibility in applying the baseline security controls in accordance with the tailoring guidance provided in Special Publication 800-53. This allows agencies to adjust the security controls to more closely fit their mission requirements and operational environments.
The controls selected or planned must be documented in the System Security Plan.

===Risk assessment===
The combination of FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53 requires a foundational level of security for all federal information and information systems. The agency's risk assessment validates the security control set and determines if any additional controls are needed to protect agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. The resulting set of security controls establishes a level of "security due diligence" for the federal agency and its contractors.&lt;ref name="assessment"&gt;NIST SP 800-53A "Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems"&lt;/ref&gt;
A risk assessment starts by identifying potential [[threat (computer)|threats]] and [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] and mapping implemented [[security control|controls]] to individual vulnerabilities.  One then determines risk by calculating the likelihood and impact that any given vulnerability could be exploited, taking into account existing controls.  The culmination of the risk assessment shows the calculated risk for all vulnerabilities and describes whether the risk should be accepted or mitigated.  If mitigated by the implementation of a control, one needs to describe what additional Security Controls will be added to the system.

NIST also initiated the Information Security Automation Program (ISAP) and [[Security Content Automation Protocol]] (SCAP) that support and complement the approach for achieving consistent, cost-effective security control assessments.

===System security plan===
Agencies should develop policy on the system security planning process.&lt;ref name="fisma"/&gt; NIST SP-800-18 introduces the concept of a System Security Plan.&lt;ref name="nist-sp-800-18"/&gt; System security plans are living documents that require periodic review, modification, and plans of action and milestones for implementing security controls. Procedures should be in place outlining who reviews the plans, keeps the plan current, and follows up on planned security controls.&lt;ref name="nist-sp-800-18"/&gt;

The System security plan is the major input to the security certification and accreditation process for the system. During the security certification and accreditation process, the system security plan is analyzed, updated, and accepted. The certification agent confirms that the security controls described in the system security plan are consistent with the FIPS 199 security category determined for the information system, and that the threat and vulnerability identification and initial risk determination are identified and documented in the system security plan, risk assessment, or equivalent document.&lt;ref name="nist-sp-800-18"/&gt;

===Certification and accreditation===
Once the system documentation and risk assessment has been completed, the system's controls must be reviewed and certified to be functioning appropriately. Based on the results of the review, the information system is accredited. The certification and accreditation process is defined in NIST SP 800-37 "Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems".&lt;ref name="nist-sp-800-37"&gt;NIST SP 800-37 "Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems&lt;/ref&gt;
Security accreditation is the official management decision given by a senior agency official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls. Required by [[OMB Circular A-130]], Appendix III, security accreditation provides a form of quality control and challenges managers and technical staffs at all levels to implement the most effective security controls possible in an information system, given mission requirements, technical constraints, operational constraints, and cost/schedule constraints. By accrediting an information system, an agency official accepts responsibility for the security of the system and is fully accountable for any adverse impacts to the agency if a breach of security occurs. Thus, responsibility and accountability are core principles that characterize security accreditation. It is essential that agency officials have the most complete, accurate, and trustworthy information possible on the security status of their information systems in order to make timely, credible, risk-based decisions on whether to authorize operation of those systems.&lt;ref name="nist-sp-800-37"/&gt;

The information and supporting evidence needed for security accreditation is developed during a detailed security review of an information system, typically referred to as security certification. Security certification is a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls in an information system, made in support of security accreditation, to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. The results of a security certification are used to reassess the risks and update the system security plan, thus providing the factual basis for an authorizing official to render a security accreditation decision.&lt;ref name="nist-sp-800-37"/&gt;

===Continuous monitoring===
All accredited systems are required to monitor a selected set of security controls and the system documentation is updated to reflect changes and modifications to the system. Large changes to the security profile of the system should trigger an updated risk assessment, and controls that are significantly modified may need to be re-certified.

Continuous monitoring activities include configuration management and control of information system components, security impact analyses of changes to the system, ongoing assessment of security controls, and status reporting. The organization establishes the selection criteria and subsequently selects a subset of the security controls employed within the information system for assessment. The organization also establishes the schedule for control monitoring to ensure adequate coverage is achieved.

==Critique==
Security experts Bruce Brody, a former federal chief information security officer, and Alan Paller, director of research for the [[SANS Institute]], have described FISMA as "a well-intentioned but fundamentally flawed tool", arguing that the compliance and reporting methodology mandated by FISMA measures security planning rather than measuring information security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mar 18, 2007 |url=http://gcn.com/Articles/2007/03/18/FISMAs-effectiveness-questioned.aspx?Page=2 |title=Government Computer News, FISMA efficiency questioned, 2007 |publisher=Gcn.com |date=2007-03-18 |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] chief technology officer Keith Rhodes said that FISMA can and has helped government system security but that implementation is everything, and if security people view FISMA as just a checklist, nothing is going to get done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jun 10, 2009 |url=http://gcn.com/Articles/2009/06/15/Interview-Keith-Rhodes-IT-security.aspx?sc_lang=en&amp;Page=2 |title=Government Computer News, Effective IT security starts with risk analysis, former GAO CTO says |publisher=Gcn.com |date=2009-06-10 |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7013">'''Folk linguistics''' is the [[amateur]] study of [[linguistics]]. The term is often used as a [[pejorative]].

The [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Ray Jackendoff]] points out that applying folk linguistics to education can be potentially damaging to the attainment of students who speak [[less standard dialect]]s. Characterising different speech as ''good'' or ''bad'' can have a serious effect.{{Ref label|a|a|none}}

The term ''folk linguistics'' can also refer to [[ideological]]&lt;ref name=BerGr&gt;{{cite book|last=Gröschel |first=Bernhard| authorlink=Bernhard Gröschel |year=2009  |language=German |title=Das Serbokroatische zwischen Linguistik und Politik: mit einer Bibliographie zum postjugoslavischen Sprachenstreit |trans-title=Serbo-Croatian Between Linguistics and Politics: With a Bibliography of the Post-Yugoslav Language Dispute |series=Lincom Studies in Slavic Linguistics ; vol 34 |location=Munich |publisher=Lincom Europa |pages=147, 312–329 |isbn=978-3-929075-79-3 |oclc=428012015 |lccn=2009473660 |ol=15295665W}}&lt;/ref&gt; ideas of language, such as [[nationalist]]&lt;ref name=KordiJin&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |year=2010 |language=Serbo-Croatian |title=Jezik i nacionalizam |trans-title=Language and Nationalism |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf |deadurl=no |series=Rotulus Universitas |location=Zagreb |publisher=Durieux |pages=116–119 |isbn=978-953-188-311-5 |lccn=2011520778 |oclc=729837512 |ol=15270636W |archivedate=8 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/690BiBe4T?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf |accessdate=5 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; views of language. The scientific understanding of language by linguists often contradicts that of native speakers.&lt;ref name=BerGr/&gt;&lt;ref name=KordiJin/&gt;

==Examples==
{{see also|List of common misconceptions about language learning}}

Jackendoff (2003){{Ref label|a|a|none}} cites the following statements as typical examples of folk-linguistic beliefs.

* Claim: "Parents teach their children to talk". Adults assume that children either learn language directly from their parents or via simple [[imitation]]. 
** On the contrary, research in child [[language acquisition]] shows that a child acquires language more automatically, through a systematic pattern rarely noticed by adults. Although interaction with parents, adults and other children is crucial, it is actually very difficult to "correct" a child. Instead most children are able to learn to speak native languages (including those of their peers of the same age) through a process called "acquisition".{{Ref label|b|b|none}} Any [[speech error|error]]s noticed by a parent are often self-corrected by the child weeks or months later.
* Claim: "Children will get confused if they try to speak more than one language". Many parents are afraid a child cannot sort out input from multiple languages. 
** In reality, children can easily become [[simultaneous bilingualism|bilingual]] (native proficiency in two languages) if they are exposed to more than one language. There may be period of confusion, but most children are able to segregate two distinct grammars.
* Claim: "There is a proper, correct English".  Speakers generally value an educated form of the language, often its written form, and that other [[dialect]]al/spoken forms are considered structurally inferior or "sloppy", and speakers of these forms are often regarded as "stupid, lazy, sloppy, hick" or other pejorative terms.  
** However, linguists generally agree that dialectal forms such as [[AAVE|African American Vernacular English (AAVE)]]  have the same grammatical complexity as a standard English. Folk linguistic beliefs view these forms as inferior, and as a result speakers of non-standard forms often suffer forms of linguistic discrimination.{{Ref label|a|a|none}}
* Claim: "The modern language is going downhill". [[linguistic purism|Purist]]s opine that changes in the spoken language (e.g. [[new word]]s, innovations in grammar, new pronunciation patterns) are generally regarded as being detrimental rather than just change.
** In fact, living languages are not static. Their evolution is not just a modern phenomenon.

Other beliefs may include:
* A belief that a language's grammar can negatively influence and restrict how people think. This is also known as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis|strong Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]. Although some linguists do advocate a form of this, many linguists reject this as being too simplistic.{{Ref label|b|b|none}} For instance, just because a language does not formally distinguish "he" vs. "she" in their personal pronouns does not mean that speakers do not distinguish and treat men and women differently. Similarly, just because English lacks a formal [[hodiernal tense]] does not mean that English speakers cannot distinguish events which occur "today" versus those on another day.
* Examples of [[folk etymology]] such as interpreting ''[[asparagus]]'' as "sparrow-grass".{{Ref label|b|b|none}} These are cases where speakers deduce an incorrect word origin. Another folk etymology is the assumption that the New York place name ''[[Fishkill, New York|Fishkill]]'' (on [[Fishkill Creek]]) means a place to kill fish. In reality, ''[[kill (creek)|-kill]]'' is from a Dutch word meaning "creek" (found also in river names such as [[Schuylkill River|Schuylkill, Pennsylvania]] and [[Wallkill River|Wallkill, New Jersey]]). However the folk etymology caused animal rights groups such as [[PETA]] to demand that the town should be renamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A fishy name will stay the same|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9609/06/fishy.name/| publisher=CNN|date=September 6, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Food science''' is the [[applied science]] devoted to the study of [[food]]. The [[Institute of Food Technologists]] defines food science as "the discipline in which the engineering, biological, and physical sciences are used to study the nature of foods, the causes of deterioration, the principles underlying [[food processing]], and the improvement of foods for the consuming public".&lt;ref&gt;Heldman, Dennis R. "IFT and the Food Science Profession." ''Food Technology.'' October 2006. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The textbook ''Food Science'' defines food science in simpler terms as "the application of basic sciences and engineering to study the physical, chemical, and biochemical nature of foods and the principles of food processing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Food Science| series = Food science texts series|edition =5th| first1 = Norman N. |last1 = Potter| first2= Joseph H.| last2= Hotchkiss| publisher= Springer| year =1998| isbn= 9780834212657| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ERoAm13YF8IC&amp;dq=Food+science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities of food scientists include the development of new food products, design of processes to produce these foods, choice of packaging materials, [[shelf-life]] studies, sensory evaluation of products using [[survey panel]]s or potential consumers, as well as microbiological and chemical testing.&lt;ref name="ift.org Food Science Activity Guides"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ift.org/knowledge-center/learn-about-food-science/k12-outreach/activity-guides.aspx | title=Food Science Activity Guides | accessdate=February 2, 2015 | website=IFT.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food scientists may study more fundamental phenomena that are directly linked to the production of food products and its properties.

Food science brings together multiple scientific disciplines. It incorporates concepts from fields such as [[microbiology]], [[chemical engineering]], and [[biochemistry]].

==Disciplines==
Some of the subdisciplines of food science are described below.

===Food chemistry===
{{main article|Food chemistry}}
Food chemistry is the study of [[chemical]] processes and interactions of all biological and non-biological components of foods.&lt;ref&gt;John M. de Man.1999. ''Principles of Food Chemistry'' (Food Science Text Series), Springer Science, Third Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M. de Man. 2009. Food process engineering and technology, Academic Press, Elsevier: London and New York, 1st edn.&lt;/ref&gt; The biological substances include such items as [[meat]], [[poultry]], [[lettuce]], [[beer]], and [[milk]] as examples.
It is similar to [[biochemistry]] in its main components such as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]], but it also includes areas such as water, [[vitamin]]s, [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], [[enzyme]]s, [[food additive]]s, [[flavor]]s, and [[Food coloring|colors]]. This discipline also encompasses how products change under certain [[food processing]] techniques and ways either to enhance or to prevent them from happening.

====Food physical chemistry====
{{main article|Food physical chemistry}}
Food physical chemistry is the study of both physical and chemical interactions in foods in terms of physical and chemical principles applied to food systems, as well as the application of physicochemical techniques and instrumentation for the study and analysis of foods.

===Food engineering===
{{main article|Food engineering}}
[[File:Factory Automation Robotics Palettizing Bread.jpg|thumb|A pizza factory in Germany, an example of [[food engineering]]]]
Food engineering is the industrial processes used to [[Food manufacture|manufacture food]].

===Food microbiology===
[[File:LUA, Faculty of Food Technology Food microbiology laboratory.jpg|thumbnail|[[Food microbiology]] laboratory at the [[Faculty of Food Technology, Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies|Faculty of Food Technology]], [[Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies]].]]
{{main article|Food microbiology}}
Food microbiology is the study of the [[microorganism]]s that inhabit, create, or [[Food contaminant|contaminate]] [[food]], including the study of microorganisms causing food spoilage.&lt;ref name=FratamicoBayles&gt;{{cite book | author = Fratamico PM and Bayles DO (editor). | title = Foodborne Pathogens: Microbiology and Molecular Biology | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2005 |  isbn = 978-1-904455-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Good" bacteria, however, such as [[probiotics]], are becoming increasingly important in food science.&lt;ref name=Tannockpro3&gt;{{cite book | author = Tannock GW (editor). | title = Probiotics and Prebiotics: Scientific Aspects | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2005 | isbn =  978-1-904455-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= LjunghWadstrom&gt;{{cite book |author= Ljungh A, Wadstrom T (editors)| year=2009 |title=Lactobacillus Molecular Biology: From Genomics to Probiotics | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-41-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= MayoB&gt;{{cite book |author= Mayo, B; van Sinderen, D (editor)| year=2010 |title=Bifidobacteria: Genomics and Molecular Aspects | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-68-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, microorganisms are essential for the production of foods such as [[cheese]], [[yogurt]], [[bread]], [[beer]], [[wine]] and, other [[Fermentation in food processing|fermented foods]].

===Food packaging===
[[File:FoodScience-ex2.png|thumbnail|[[Food packaging]] in progress]]

===Food preservation===
{{main article|Food preservation}}
Food preservation involves the causes and prevention of quality spoilage

===Food substitution===
Food substitution refers to the replacement of fat, sugar, or calories from a product while maintaining similar shape, texture, color, or taste.

===Food technology===
{{main article|Food technology}}
Food technology is the technological aspects.
Early scientific research into food technology concentrated on food preservation. Nicolas Appert’s development in 1810 of the canning process was a decisive event.  The process wasn’t called canning then and Appert did not really know the principle on which his process worked, but canning has had a major impact on food preservation techniques.

===Molecular gastronomy===
{{main article|Molecular gastronomy}}
Molecular gastronomy is the scientific investigation of processes in cooking, social and artistic [[gastronomic]]al phenomena.
Molecular gastronomy is a subdiscipline of food science that seeks to investigate the physical and chemical transformations of ingredients that occur in cooking. Its program includes three axis, as cooking was recognized to have three components, which are social, artistic and technical.

===New product development===
{{main article|New product development}}
New product development includes the invention of new food products.

===Quality control===
{{main article|Quality control}}
[[File:FoodScience-ex3.png|thumbnail|A technician performing [[quality control]]]]

Quality control involves the causes, prevention and communication dealing with [[food-borne illness]]. 

Quality control also ensures that product meets specs to ensure the customer receives what they expect from the packaging to the physical properties of the product itself.

===Sensory analysis===
{{main article|Sensory analysis}}
Sensory analysis is the study of how consumers' senses perceive food.

==By country==

===Australia===
{{main|Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation}}
The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is the federal government agency for scientific research in [[Australia]]. CSIRO maintains more than 50 sites across Australia and biological control research stations in France and Mexico. It has nearly 6,500 employees.

===South Korea===
The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology, or KoSFoST, claims to be the first society in South Korea for food science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kosfost.or.kr/eng/|title=Korean Society of Food Science and Technology (KoSFoST)|publisher=KoSFoST |accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=February 2015}}

===United States===
In the United States, food science is typically studied at [[land-grant universities]]. Many of the country's pioneering food scientists were women who had attended chemistry programs at land-grant universities (which were state-run and largely under state mandates to allow for sex-blind admission), but then graduated and had difficulty finding jobs due to widespread sexism in the chemistry industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Finding conventional career paths blocked, they found alternative employment as instructors in [[home economics]] departments and used that as a base to launch the foundation of many modern food science programs.

The main US organization regarding food science and [[food technology]] is the [[Institute of Food Technologists]] (IFT), headquartered in [[Chicago, Illinois]], which is the US member organisation of the [[International Union of Food Science and Technology]] (IUFoST).

'''HyShot''' is a research project of The [[University of Queensland]], [[Australia]] [http://hypersonics.mechmining.uq.edu.au/ Centre for Hypersonics], to demonstrate the possibility of supersonic combustion under flight conditions using two scramjet engines, one designed by The University of Queensland and one designed by QinetiQ (formerly the MOD's Defence Evaluation &amp; Research Agency).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Michael K. Smart, Neal E. Hass, and Allan Paull.  "Flight Data Analysis of the HyShot 2 Scramjet Flight Experiment", AIAA Journal, Vol. 44, No. 10 (2006), pp. 2366-2375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=British scramjet engine prepares for Australian space tests |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/index.html?article=2350 |publisher=[[The University of Queensland]] |format= |date=2012-09-17 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The project has involved the successful launch of one engine designed by The University of Queensland, and one launch of the [[scramjet]] designed by the British company [[QinetiQ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/index.html?article=2350 |title=British scramjet engine prepares for Australian space tests |work=UQ News |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each combustion unit was launched on the nose of a [[RIM-2 Terrier|Terrier]]-[[Orion (rocket)|Orion]] Mk70 [[sounding rocket]] on a high [[ballistics|ballistic]] trajectory, reaching altitudes of approximately 330&amp;nbsp;km.  The rocket was rotated to face the ground, and the combustion unit ignited for a period of 6–10 seconds while falling between 35&amp;nbsp;km and 23&amp;nbsp;km at around [[Mach number|Mach]]&amp;nbsp;7.6.  The system is not designed to produce thrust.

* The first HyShot flight was on 30 October 2001 but was a failure due to the rocket going off course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4832254.stm |title=Revolutionary jet engine tested |work=BBC News |date=26 March 2006 |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first successful launch (Hyshot II) was of a University of Queensland scramjet on 30 July 2002.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It is believed by many to be the first successful flight of a [[scramjet]] engine, although some dispute this and point primarily to earlier tests by [[Russia]]n scientists.&lt;ref&gt;A.Roudakov,
 V.Semenov, J.Hicks "Recent Flight Test Results of the Joint CIAMNASA 
Mach 6.5 Scramjet Flight Program" NASA/TP-1998-206548.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A second successful flight (HyShot III) using a [[QinetiQ]] scramjet was achieved on 25 March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/index.html?article=9258 |title=HyShot scramjet experiment blasts off in South Australian desert |work=UQ News |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later QinetiQ prototype is cylindrical with four stainless steel combustors around the outside.  The aerodynamics of the vehicle is improved by this arrangement but it was expensive to manufacture.
* The HyShot IV flight on 30 March 2006 launched successfully, and telemetry was received, however it is believed that the scramjet did not function as expected. Data analysis is required to confirm what occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/index.html?article=9303 |title=HyShot™4 scramjet experiment lifts off |work=UQ News |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* HyCAUSE was launched on 15 June 2007. (The HyCAUSE experiment differed from the HyShot launches in that a Talos-Castor combination was used for launch and the target Mach number was 10.)
The carrier rocket for the HyShot experiments was composed of a [[RIM-2 Terrier]] first stage (6 second burn, 4000&amp;nbsp;km/h) and an [[Orion (US-rocket)|Orion]] second stage (26 second burn, 8600&amp;nbsp;km/h, 56&amp;nbsp;km altitude).  A fairing over the payload was then jettisoned.  The package then coasted to an altitude of around 300&amp;nbsp;km. Cold gas [[nitrogen]] [[attitude control]] [[Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters]] were used to re-orient the payload for [[atmospheric reentry]].  The experiments each lasted for some 5 seconds as the payload descended between approximately 35 and 23 kilometers altitude, when [[liquid hydrogen]] fuel was fed to the scramjet. [[Telemetry]] reported results to receivers on the ground for later analysis.  The payload landed about 400&amp;nbsp;km down range from the launch site, at which time its temperature was still expected to be about 300 degrees Celsius, which may be enough to cause a small brush fire and thereby make spotting and recovery easier even though a [[radio beacon]] was in the payload.

There has been much analysis of the data obtained in flight and comparison with results from experiments conducted in ground-testing facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, AD; Hannemann, K; Paull, A; Steelant, J "Post flight analysis of the HyShot supersonic combustion flight experiment in HEG", In: Proceedings of the Fifth European Symposium on Aerothermodynamics for Space Vehicles.

The Hyshot program spawned the [[HyCAUSE]] (Hypersonic Collaborative Australian/United States Experiment) program [http://www.uq.edu.au/news/?article=5546]: a collaborative effort between the United States’ Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) and Australia's [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]] (DSTO), also representing the research collaborators in the Australian Hypersonics Initiative (AHI)[http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/news/5118/].

All tests were conducted at the [[Woomera Test Range]] in [[South Australia]].

The Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation (HIFiRE) program was created jointly by DSTO and the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] (AFRL). HIFiRE was formed to investigate hypersonic flight technology, the fundamental science and technology required, and its potential for next generation aeronautical systems.  This will involve up to ten flights with The [[University of Queensland]] involved in at least the first three:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Centre for Hypersonics - HyShot Flight Program &amp; HIFiRE program |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/hypersonics/index.html?page=19501 |publisher=[[The University of Queensland]] |date= |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5700">'''Induction''' is used to refer to a period during which a [[Newly Qualified Teacher]] in [[England]] or [[Wales]] is both supported and assessed to ensure that regulatory standards are met.

==Background==
Although probation periods for new teachers had only been dropped in 1992, the [[Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998]] introduced arrangements by which the [[Secretary of State for Education]] could bring about regulations requiring new teachers to serve a period of induction.&lt;ref name="act"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/80030--d.htm|title=Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998|accessdate=2007-01-22|publisher=HMSO|year=1998|author=HM Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the then secretary of state, [[David Blunkett]] introduced an induction period under The Education (Induction Arrangements for School Teachers) (England) Regulations 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1999/19991065.htm|title=The Education (Induction Arrangements for School Teachers) (England) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/1065) |accessdate=2007-01-21|publisher=HMSO|year=1999|author=HM Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regulations made it a requirement that all teachers complete an induction period equivalent to one year upon qualification as a teacher.

==Requirements==
Under current regulations, teachers wishing to work in maintained [[state school]]s must satisfactorily complete a period of induction. During this period, a newly qualified teacher is entitled to additional support and subject to regular observation and assessment to ensure that he or she is meeting the required induction standards.

===Standards===
Having achieved [[Qualified Teacher Status]] (QTS), teachers are expected to continue to meet the standards required for that qualification. In addition, they must meet the 6 criteria set out in the induction standards:
# Seek and use opportunities to work collaboratively with colleagues to raise standards by sharing effective practice in the school.
#Show a commitment to their professional development by
##identifying areas in which they need to improve their professional knowledge, understanding and practice in order to teach more effectively in their current post, and
##with support, taking steps to address these needs. 
#Plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils in their classes with special educational needs, with or without statements, and in consultation with the SENCO contribute to the preparation, implementation, monitoring and review of Individual Education Plans or the equivalent.
#Liaise effectively with parents or carers on pupils’ progress and achievements.
#Work effectively as part of a team and, as appropriate to the post in which they are completing induction, liaise with, deploy, and guide the work of other adults who support pupils’ learning.
#Secure a standard of behaviour that enables pupils to learn, and act to pre empt and deal with inappropriate behaviour in the context of the behaviour policy of the school.

===Support===
In order to support newly qualified teachers in meeting the standards, a number of entitlements are guaranteed by regulations:
*a reduced timetable (of no more than 90% of other equivalent teachers)
*support from an induction tutor
*a named induction contact at a [[local education authority]] or other body

===Assessment===
In addition, all teachers undergoing a programme of induction are subject to assessment processes, including:
*regular observations every 6–8 weeks
*a termly review meeting
*a decision at the end of the induction period to ascertain whether the required standards have been met.

==Restrictions==
Induction can only be completed in a restricted range of school types. Similarly, teachers who have not completed, and are not completing, induction can only be employed in such school types under special circumstances

===Completing induction===
Induction can only be completed in eligible schools in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]], [[Isle of Man]], [[Gibraltar]] or at [[Service Children's Education]] (SCE) schools in [[Cyprus]] and [[Germany]].
Eligible schools are [[maintained school]]s, non-maintained [[special school]]s, [[independent school]]s (with support from either a [[local education authority]] or [[The Independent Schools' Council Teacher Induction Panel]], or a [[sixth form college]] under certain circumstances.

===Teachers not completing induction===
Teachers who have not completed a period of induction are limited in the work they can carry out in eligible schools.

Where a teacher is employed in an eligible school for at least one term, he or she must be offered, and must undertake, a programme of induction lasting throughout that period.

Teachers who have not completed a period of induction can only work in eligible schools for periods of less than one term during a restricted time-frame. This time-frame begins on the first day that such employment begins, and expires no later than four terms from that date (approximately 16 months). Teachers who have reached this point may seek an extension to this period from the relevant [[local education authority]].

Teachers who have not completed a period of induction are eligible to work in [[independent school]]s

===Time limits===
As stated in the statutory guidance on induction for newly qualified teachers in England, there is no set time limit for starting or completing an induction period. The previous ruling that an NQT needed to complete the induction period within 5 years was abolished in September 2008.

The '''Institute of International Law''' ([[French language|French]]: '''Institut de Droit International''') is an organization devoted to the study and development of [[international law]],  whose membership comprises the world's leading public international lawyers. The organization is generally considered the most authoritative world academy of international law, and its work earned the Nobel Peace Prize in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.idi-iil.org/en/a-propos/prix-nobel-de-la-paix/ |title= Nobel Peace Prize |via= The Institute of International Law }}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''
==History==
The institute was founded by [[Gustave Moynier]] and [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns]], together with 9 other renowned international lawyers, on 8 September 1873 in the ''Salle de l'Arsenal'' of the [[Ghent]] Town Hall in [[Belgium]]. The founders of 1873 were: 
* [[Pasquale Stanislao Mancini]] (from Rome), President; 
* [[Émile Louis Victor de Laveleye|Emile de Laveleye]] (from Liege); 
* [[Tobias Michael Carel Asser]] (from Amsterdam); 
* [[James Lorimer (jurist)|James Lorimer]] (from Edinburgh); 
* [[Wladimir Besobrassof]] (from Saint-Petersburg); 
* [[Gustave Moynier]] (from Geneva); 
* [[Johann Kaspar Bluntschli|Jean Gaspar Bluntschli]] (from Heidelberg); 
* [[Augusto Pierantoni]] (from Naples); 
* [[Carlos Calvo (historian)|Carlos Calvo]] (from Buenos Aires); 
* [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns]] (from Ghent); 
* [[David Dudley Field]] (from New York)

==Organization==
The Institute is a private body, made up of ''associates'', ''members'', and ''honorary members''. The Statute stipulates that the number of members and associates under the age of 80 cannot be over 132. The members, invited by the organization, are persons who have demonstrated notable scholarly work in the area of international law, and is restricted to those who are considered relatively free of political pressure. The organisation attempts to have members broadly distributed around the world. 

The organisation holds biannual congresses for the study of international law as it currently exists, and passes resolutions proposing modifications to international law. It does not comment on specific disputes.

While its recommendations cover international law in its many forms, some of its resolutions particularly pertain to [[international human rights law|human rights law]] and peaceful [[dispute resolution]]. It is for this reason that the organization received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

The organization remains active, with a congress held in Naples in Sept 2009. The location of the institute's headquarters rotates according to the origin of the Secretary General. The current headquarters are at the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] in Geneva, Switzerland. 

Current members of the Institut include, amongst other prominent lawyers and legal academics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idi-iil.org/idiE/navig_members.html |title=IDI-Membres |publisher=Idi-iil.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704193742/http://www.idi-iil.org/idiE/navig_members.html |archivedate=2013-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; judges of the [[International Court of Justice]], International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, and [[International Criminal Court]]. 

Recent resolutions from the organization cover many important areas such as universal jurisdiction, provisional measures, regime of wrecks, immunity, environment, use of force, etc.

The Institut publishes its Annuaire, containing the reports of the commissions, deliberations of the plenary sessions, and any resulting declarations and resolutions. The records of the administrative sessions including elections are also included in the Annuaire. The website for the works of the Institut is here: http://www.idi-iil.org/en/publications/

The Institut maintains a website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idi-iil.org idi-iil.org]&lt;/ref&gt;. The website has been recently revamped and contains much useful information such as the declarations and resolutions, and some works in progress for future inclusion in the Annuaire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4084">{{hatnote|This article deals with the general meaning of the '''integument'''. Consult articles listed below for other articles dealing with similar or related concepts}}

In biology, '''integument''' is the natural covering of an organism or an organ, such as its [[skin]], [[husk]], [[Exoskeleton|shell]], or [[Peel (fruit)|rind]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"/&gt;

It derives from ''integumentum'', which means "a covering" in [[Latin]]. In a transferred or figurative sense, it could mean a [[cloak]] or a [[disguise]].&lt;ref name="Latin Cassel"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marchant, J.R.V. |author2=Charles Joseph F. | title = Cassell's Latin dictionary | publisher = Cassell | location = London | year = 1952 | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In English "integument" is a fairly modern word, its origin having been traced back to the early seventeenth century. It can mean a material or layer with which anything is enclosed, clothed, or covered in the sense of "clad" or "coated", as with a skin or husk.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Botanical usage ==
In [[botany]] the senses are similar to those in zoology, referring to the covering of an organ. When the context indicates nothing to the contrary, the word commonly refers to an envelope covering the [[Ovule#Integuments, chivai and chalaza|ovule]]. The integument may consist of one layer (or unitegmic) or two layers (or bitegmic), each of which consisting of two or more layers of cells. The integument is perforated by a pore, the micropyle, through which the pollen tube can enter. It may develop into the testa, or [[seed]] coat.

==Zoological usage==
The integument of an organ in [[zoology]] typically would comprise membranes of connective tissue such as those around a kidney or liver. In referring to the integument of an animal, the usual sense is its skin and its derivatives: the [[integumentary system]], where "integumentary" is a simile for "[[Skin|cutaneous]]".

In arthropods, the integument, or external "skin", consists of a single layer of [[epithelium|epithelial]] [[ectoderm]] from which arises the [[cuticle]],&lt;ref name="Kristensen&amp;Georges2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kristensen|first1=Niels P.|last2=Georges|first2=Chauvin|title=Lepidoptera, Moths and Butterflies: Morphology, Physiology, and Development : Teilband|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5w8FgSGuH34C&amp;pg=PA484|accessdate=10 January 2013|date=1 December 2003|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-016210-3|page=484|chapter=Integument}}&lt;/ref&gt; an outer covering of [[chitin]] the rigidity of which varies as per its chemical composition.

==Derivative terms and sundry usages==
Derivative terms include various adjectival forms such as integumentary (e.g. system), integumental (e.g. integumental glands, "peltate glands, the integument being raised like a bladder due to abundant secretion"&lt;ref name="BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt;) and integumented (as opposed to bare).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Collocott, T. C. (ed.) | title = Dictionary of science and technology | publisher = W. and R. Chambers | location = Edinburgh | year = 1974 | isbn = 0-550-13202-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other illustrative examples of usage occur in the following articles:
*[[Connective tissue in skeletal muscle]]
*[[Dorsal artery of the penis]] (example of integument enclosing an internal organ)
*[[Flensing]]
*[[Flesh]] (generic use of plural "integuments")
*[[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]] (figurative usage)
*[[Integumentary system]] (senses related to vertebrate skin and medical aspects)
*[[Cat anatomy#Muscles|Integumental muscles]]
*[[Mosasaur#Soft tissue|Mosasaur]]
*[[Seed]]

In [[telecommunication]], an '''isochronous signal''' is a [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] in which the [[time]] interval separating any two significant instants is equal to the [[Unit interval (data transmission)|unit interval]] or a multiple of the unit interval. Variations in the time intervals are constrained within specified limits.

"[[Isochronous]]" is a characteristic of one signal, while "[[Synchronization|synchronous]]" indicates a relationship between two or more signals.

'''Kebony''' is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] wood producer. The company has its roots in Wood Polymer Technologies (WPT), which was founded in 1996 and changed its name to Kebony in 2007. Kebony has a factory in [[Skien, Norway|Skien]] (Norway) and offices in [[Oslo, Norway|Oslo]] (Norway).

==Technology==

Kebony has developed an environmental technology which provides an alternative to threatened and endangered tropical hardwoods, and traditional impregnated wood. In the process, a liquid byproduct of the sugar industry, [[furfuryl alcohol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of the Kebony Technology |url=http://www.martenshout.be/assets/pdf/Kebony_tech-EXT_Jan14.pdf |publisher=martenshout.be |accessdate=11 Jan 2015 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to treat the wood. Using pressure, vacuum and heat treatment, the liquid transforms to [[furan resin]] and is tied together with the cell structure of the wood in order to improve the wood's abilities permanently. The woods used are [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]]-certified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Stewardship Council|url=http://www.fsc.org/|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification|PEFC]]-certified and carry the [[Nordic Ecolabel]] "the Swan".

[[Image:Pm-map.png|thumb|300px|right|The Isthmus of Panama is a '''land bridge''' whose appearance 3 million years ago allowed the [[Great American Interchange]].]]

A '''land bridge''', in [[biogeography]], is an [[isthmus]] or wider land connection between otherwise separate areas, over which [[animals]] and [[plant]]s are able to cross and [[colonise]] new lands. A land bridge can be created by [[marine regression]], in which [[sea level]]s fall, exposing shallow, previously submerged sections of [[continental shelf]]; or when new land is created by [[plate tectonics]]; or occasionally when the sea floor rises due to [[post-glacial rebound]] after an [[ice age]].

==Prominent examples==
* [[Adam's Bridge]] (known as [[Rama Setu]]), connecting [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]]
* The [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]], which  intermittently connected [[Asia]] with [[North America]] as sea levels rose and fell under the effect of ice ages
* [[Doggerland]], a former landmass in the southern [[North Sea]] which connected the island of [[Great Britain]] to mainland [[Europe]] during the last ice age
* The [[Isthmus of Panama]], whose appearance three million years ago allowed the [[Great American Interchange]]
* The [[Sinai Peninsula]], linking [[Africa]] and [[Eurasia]]

==Land bridge theory==
In the 19th century a number of scientists noted puzzling geological and zoological similarities between widely separated areas. To solve these problems, "whenever geologists and paleontologists were at a loss to explain the obvious transoceanic similarities of life that they deduced from the fossil records, they sharpened their pencils and sketched land bridges between appropriate continents."&lt;ref name=corliss&gt;{{cite book|author=[[William R. Corliss|Corliss, William R.]]| title=Mysteries Beneath the Sea|publisher= Apollo Editions|date= June 1975|isbn=978-0815203735}} Chapter 5: "Up-and-Down Landbridges".&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was first proposed by [[Jules Marcou]] in ''Lettres sur les roches du Jura  et leur distribution géographique dans les deux hémisphères'' ("Letters on the rocks of the [[Jura Mountains|Jura [Mountains] ]] and their geographic distribution in the two hemispheres"), 1857–1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[William R. Corliss|Corliss, William R.]]| title=Mysteries Beneath the Sea|publisher= Apollo Editions|date= June 1975|isbn=978-0815203735}} Chapter 5: "Up-and-Down Landbridges". "The basic idea is usually attributed to Jules Marcou..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothetical land bridges included:&lt;ref name=corliss/&gt;
* ''Archatlantis'' from the West Indies to North Africa 
* ''Archhelenis'' from Brazil to South Africa
* ''Archiboreis'' in the North Atlantic
* ''Archigalenis'' from Central America through Hawaii to Northeast Asia
* ''Archinotis'' from South America to Antarctica
* ''[[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]'' in the Indian Ocean
* ''[[Marsupials]]'' between South America and Australia.

The concept became obsolete with the gradual acceptance of [[continental drift]] and the development of [[plate tectonics]] by the mid-20th century.

[[File:Le Ménestrel 1st Edition - 1 December 1833.jpg|thumb|242 px|Front page of the first edition of ''Le Ménestrel'' (1 December 1833)]]
'''''Le Ménestrel''''' (The Minstrel) was an influential French music journal published weekly from 1833 until 1940. It was founded by Joseph-Hippolyte l'Henry and originally printed by Poussièlgue. In 1840 it was acquired by the music publishers [[Éditions Alphonse Leduc#Heugel|Heugel]] and remained with the company until the journal's demise at the beginning of World War II. With the closure of its chief rival, ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris|La Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]'' in 1880, ''Le Ménestrel'' became France's most prestigious and longest-running music journal.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2007) pp. 2 and 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==
In 1827 [[François-Joseph Fétis]] had founded ''La Revue Musicale'', France's first periodical devoted entirely to classical music. By 1834 it had two serious competitors, ''Le Ménestrel'' established in 1833 and [[Maurice Schlesinger]]'s ''Gazette Musicale'' established in 1834. ''Le Ménestrel'' was founded by the Paris publisher Joseph-Hippolyte l'Henry, with the first edition (printed by Poussièlgue) appearing on 1 December 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Gautier (1995) p. 156; ''Le Ménestrel'' (1 December 1833)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1835, Schlesinger bought ''La Revue Musicale'' from Fétis and merged the two journals into ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris|La Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]''. Until ''La Revue et Gazette'' ceased publication in 1880, ''Le Ménestrel'' was to be its main rival in terms of influence and breadth of coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2007) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

E. D'Arlhac took over the directorship of ''Le Ménestrel'' in July 1835, but relinquished it the following March to the journalist and critic [[Jules Lovy]], who had been a writer for the journal since its foundation. By 1836 ''Le Ménestrel'' had a weekly print run of 600 copies, although as [[Katharine Ellis]] points out, the number of actual readers was probably much larger. At the time, Paris alone had over 500 ''[[cabinet de lecture|cabinets de lecture]]'', private reading rooms and precursors to the modern library popular in early 19th century France where for a small fee the public could read the latest issues of newspapers and journals.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2007) pp. 1-2 and 268-269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. Books: A Living History. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum, 2011. p.105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, Harry Earl. The "Cabinet de Lecture" in France, 1800-1850. The Library Quarterly, 48(1). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, the newly formed music publishing partnership of [[Jacques-Léopold Heugel]] and [[Jean-Antoine Meissonnier]] acquired ''Le Ménestrel''. Heugel became the director, and Jules Lovy stayed on as editor-in-chief until his death in 1863. Lovy was succeeded by the critic and music historian [[Joseph d'Ortigue]]. Later editors-in-chief included [[Arthur Pougin]] who served from 1885 to 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Watanabe (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; However, after d'Ortigue's death in 1866, only the Heugel name appeared on the [[Masthead (publishing)|masthead]]. When Jacques-Léopold died in 1883, his son Henri-Georges Heugel took over as director. He was in turn succeeded by his own son Jacques-Paul who served as the director for the remainder of the journal's existence.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Ménestrel'' (3 February 1933) p. 52; Feurzeig (1994) p. 126; Nichols and Drake (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Le Ménestrel'' was published weekly for a period spanning 107 years, initially coming out on Sunday (later changed to Saturday and then Friday). The [[Franco-Prussian War]] caused publication to be suspended from late December 1870 through November 1871, and publication was suspended again for the duration of [[World War I]], with the first post-war issue appearing on 17 October 1919. At the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, the journal carried on until the invasion of France. The 24 May 1940 issue announced that following the German attacks and the closure of theatres and concert halls in Europe and France as well as the [[Paris Conservatory]], the journal was suspending publication with the hope of resuming in the autumn.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Ménestrel'' (24 May 1940). Original text: "Nous souhaitons pouvoir reprendre, à l'automne, l'effort que nous nous sommes imposé pendant la première phase de la guerre, conscients d'avoir ainsi servi modestement, mais de notre mieux, la cause impérissable de la pensée et de l'art français."&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, it proved to be the last issue of ''Le Ménestrel''. The Heugel company continued to operate as an independent music publisher until 1980 when it was sold to [[Éditions Alphonse Leduc]].

Notable people who wrote for the journal include [[Henri Duponchel]], [[Max d'Ollone]], [[Alphonse Royer]] and [[Paul Collin]].

This '''list of electronic Floras''' is arranged by country within continent. An electronic [[flora (publication)|Flora]] is an online resource which provides descriptions of the associated plants, often also providing  identification keys, or partial identification keys, to the plants described. Some Floras point to the literature associated with the plants of the region (flora Malesiana), others seek to show the plants of a region using images (flora of India), others give an inventory of the region's plants (flora of Pakistan).

Countries with sites listing both flora and fauna have also been included, since the sites provide a useful resource for those seeking to use a Flora.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4387">A '''Master of Physics''' (or '''MPhys (Hons)''' ) honours [[academic degree|degree]] is a specific [[master's degree]] for courses in the field of [[physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucas.com/documents/ucasguides/scottishguide2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102074249/http://ucas.com/documents/ucasguides/scottishguide2010.pdf |archivedate=2010-01-02 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the MPhys is an [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] award available after pursuing a four-year course of study at a [[university]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/activity/education/Careers/Publications/file_31428.pdf|title=Education|website=Iop.org|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]] the course has a five-year duration. In some universities, the degree has the variant abbreviation '''MSci'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ugstudy/courses/physicsandastronomy/msci-physics.aspx|title=Physics MSci - The University of Nottingham|website=Nottingham.ac.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qmul.ac.uk/undergraduate/coursefinder/courses/79936.html|title=MSci Physics|website=Qmul.ac.u|accessdate=2 September 2017k}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/physics/physics-msci.aspx|title=Undergraduate degree course/programme in Physics MSc F302i – School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham - University of Birmingham|website=Birmingham.ac.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/2015/physics/msci-physics/|title=MSci Physics - Study at Bristol - University of Bristol|website=Bristol.ac.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/careers/i-am-at-school-college/undergraduate-courses/page_57508.html|title=Undergraduate courses|website=Iop.org|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are taught courses, with a [[research]] element in the final year — this can vary from a small component to an entire year working with a research group — and are not available as [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] qualifications in most cases, although depending on institution the final year can be considered as approximately equivalent to an [[Master of Science|MSc]].

===Structure===
In terms of course structure, MPhys degrees usually follow the pattern familiar from [[bachelor's degree]]s with [[lecture]]s, [[laboratory]] work, [[coursework]] and [[exam]]s each year. Usually one, or more commonly two, substantial projects are to be completed in the fourth year which may well have research elements. At the end of the second or third years, there is usually a threshold of academic performance in examinations to be reached to allow progression into the final year. Final results are, in most cases, awarded on the standard [[British undergraduate degree classification]] scale, although some universities award something structurally similar to 'Distinction', 'Merit', 'Pass' or 'Fail', as this is often the way that taught postgraduate master's degrees are classified.

===Degree schemes===
It is usual for there to be some variation in the MPhys schemes, to allow for students to study the area of physics which most interests them. For example, [[Lancaster University]]'s physics department offer the following&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/physics/ugAdmissions/index.htm|title=Physics|website=Lancs.ac.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; schemes:
*MPhys Physics
*MPhys Physics, [[Astrophysics]] and [[Cosmology]]
*MPhys Physics with [[Particle Physics]] and Cosmology
*MPhys Physics with [[Space Science]]
*MPhys Physics with Biomedical Physics
*MPhys [[Theoretical Physics]]
*MPhys Theoretical Physics with [[Mathematics]]

These schemes will usually incorporate the same core modules with additional scheme specific modules. Students tend to take all the same core modules during their first year and start to specialise in their second year. In some cases, optional modules can be taken from other schemes.

The '''Monheim Town Hall''' ([[German language|German]] ''Monheimer Rathaus'') is a historical  building   in [[Monheim, Bavaria|Monheim]], [[Bavaria]], southern [[Germany]], now owned by the city's council.

The building, constructed from 1714 to 1720 for a rich Jewish merchant, the [[Court Jew]] Abraham Elias Model, is most notable for its [[ceiling]]s, displaying motifs from the [[Old Testament]], or [[Tanakh]], which were restored in 1978 and 1994 respectively.&lt;ref name="Kostbar"&gt;{{de icon}} ''Monheim - Kleine Stadt mit grosser Vergangenheit'', Chapter: Jews as citizens in Monheim, by: Emeran Meyer (Mayor of Monheim 1978-84), page: 117-123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.junge-pfalz.de/broschuere/die_junge_pfalz.pdf ''Die Junge Pfalz''] {{de icon}} ''The young Palatinate'', page: 11, accessed: 6 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The Jewish community===
The Jewish community in Monheim was established in 1697, when Duke [[Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine|Johann Wilhelm]] allowed six Jewish families which had been banned from [[Eichstätt]], to settle in Monheim. The new community was allowed to acquire property in Monheim, to construct a [[Synagogue]] and to work as merchants in town. In the following years, the community grew considerably, numbering 19 families and 150 people by 1737.&lt;ref name="Community" &gt;[http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/monheim_synagoge.htm History of the Jewish community in Monheim] {{de icon}}, accessed: 6 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospering community however raised concerns with the local population, which was worried about eventually becoming outnumbered in town. In 1736, restrictions were passed, allowing only a limited number of weddings to be conducted by the local Jews at considerable cost. In 1741, Duke [[Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine|Charles III Philip]] passed an act banning all Jews from [[Palatinate-Neuburg]]. By the 31 July 1741, all Jews had to leave his lands and were only permitted to take with them what they could carry. No financial compensation was made for their loss of property. The Jews from Monheim left for the towns in the region not part of Palatinate-Neuburg and their origin from Monheim remains obvious through the surname ''Monheim'' or ''Monheimer''.&lt;ref name="Community" /&gt;

===The town hall===
The location of the current town hall was acquired by Abraham Elias Model in 1712 from Ferdinand Kugler for 1,025 [[Baden gulden|Gulden]].&lt;ref name="Community" /&gt; The later owned a brewery and guest house at the spot, called ''Gasthaus zur Rose''. Model had the old building demolished and commissioned a new building to be constructed, which was erected between 1714 and 1720.&lt;ref name="Kostbar" /&gt;

The new building, which was referred to in the local town chronicles as "very precious", was built in [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style. It was a square three-story building which was richly decorated, especially the ceilings. The main room on the second floor, now the council chambers, depict [[Abraham]] being prevented by the angel from sacrificing [[Isaac]], with a text in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] from the [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref name="Kostbar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Community" /&gt;

The ceiling, long hidden, was only restored in 1978.&lt;ref name="Kostbar" /&gt; Two more ceilings, also on the second floor, were restored in 1994. One depicts [[Moses]] receiving the [[Ten Commandments]] while the other shows King [[David]] playing the [[harp]].&lt;ref name="Community" /&gt;

For a time it was assumed that the house also functioned as a synagogue, Monheim having had a [[Rabbi]] since 1715, but this has since been disproven. Nothing is left of the former synagogue, which was located in the nearby building that later became the guest house ''Zum Ochsen''.&lt;ref name="Kostbar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Community" /&gt;

With the forced departure of the Jews in 1741, the building came into non-Jewish, private possession. In 1853, it was acquired by the town from the brewer Anton Wunderlich, to be used as a school house. For this purpose, the chamber that is now the main council chamber was subdivided into two rooms. The rooms were nevertheless insufficient to house all pupils and a separate building was constructed from 1892 to 1895 to house the school boys, while the girls stayed at the town hall. Eventually, two more, larger schools were completed, one in 1957 and 1976. With the completion of the later, the town hall ceased to be required for schooling purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} ''Monheim - Kleine Stadt mit grosser Vergangenheit'', Chapter: "To read and to write...", by: Dr. Paul Olbrich, page: 137-144&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceilings on the second floor can be visited free of charge during the opening hours of the town hall, provided no marriages or council meetings take place in the rooms at the time.

[[File:Universal South Building.JPG|thumb|NICHCY headquarters in the [[Adams Morgan, Washington, D.C.|Adams Morgan]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
'''National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities (NICHCY''', an acronym derived from its original name, '''National Information Center for Handicapped Children and Youth''') operated as a national centralized information resource on disabilities and special education for children and youth ages birth through 21 years, sponsored by the [[U.S. Department of Education]]. It did so by collecting, organizing and disseminating current, accurate, research-based information about childhood disability and special education. The Center also disseminated information about the  [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the nation's special education law]] and the [[NCLB|No Child Left Behind Act, the nation's general education law]].  NICHCY  focused on research, information dissemination, and providing quality information on teaching and learning.

NICHCY was de-funded by the U.S. Department of Education in 2013. Its website will continue to be available until September 2014, and its resources have been moved to [http://www.parentcenterhub.org/resources/ Center for Parent Information and Resources]. The original NICHCY website carries a short message about the decommissioning of the site following the de-funding of the organization. Here is the text of that notice:

''Regrettably, on September 30, 2013, our funding from the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) at the U.S. Department of Education ended. Our website will remain available until September 2014. Note that the new Center for Parent Information and Resources will be the new home of NICHCY resources. Visit their Resource Library at http://www.parentcenterhub.org/resources/''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the National Dissemination Center|url=http://nichcy.org/about|website=http://nichcy.org/|publisher=The National Dissemination Center|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NICHCY responded to over 2,500 requests for information each year from families, professionals, advocates, government agencies, journalists, and others concerned with issues affecting children and youth with disabilities.

NICHCY’S Research Center connected stakeholders to the knowledge base the field of special education has accumulated over years of investigation and practice.  Approximately 5,000 unique users visited the Research Center’s web site each week to find the latest research news, briefs, and analysis on effective educational practices for children with disabilities.

NICHCY's services, publications, and Web site were available in both English and Spanish. On the [http://www.parentcenterhub.org/resources/ Center for Parent Information and Resources] web site, information is available on: 
* Services for infants and toddlers with disabilities (Early intervention)
* The special education process and IEPs (individualized education programs)
* Fact sheets on disabilities ([[ADHD|Attention Deficit Disorder]], [[Autism|Autism/PDD]], [[Cerebral palsy|Cerebral Palsy]], [[Deaf|Deafness/Hearing Loss]], [[Down syndrome|Down Syndrome]], [[Serious Emotional Disturbance|Emotional Disturbance]], [[Epilepsy]], [[Learning disability|Learning Disabilities]], [[Mental retardation|Mental Retardation]], Severe and/or Multiple Disabilities, Speech-Language Impairments, [[Spina bifida|Spina Bifida]], [[Traumatic brain injury|Traumatic Brain Injury]], and [[Visual impairments|Visual Impairments]])

INEOS RAS is an internationally recognized research establishment, where the chemistry of organoelement and macromolecular compounds is developed. Its reputation as a scientific centre in chemistry is very high both in Russia and abroad. Many outstanding scientists who initiated new directions in organic and organoelement chemistry, polymer chemistry, physical chemistry, and physics, such as K.A. Andrianov, I.L. Knunyants, V.V. Korshak, I.V. Obreimov, M.E. Vol’pin, M.I. Kabachnik, O.A. Reutov, D.N. Kursanov, Yu.T. Struchkov, R.Kh. Freydlina, A.I .Kitaigorodsky, T.A. Mastryukova, M.Yu. Antipin and many others have been fruitfully working at INEOS RAS.

For recent years the scientific activities of the Institute have been supported by ~20 international grants (7th European Commission program, Swiss National Science Foundation (SNCF), Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), etc.), 50-60 grants from the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR), more than 50 grants from the Presidium of the RAS and Department of Chemistry and Material Sciences of the RAS. INEOS is also incorporated in six Federal Scientific and Technical Programmes. Six young scientists received personal Grants from the President of Russian Federation for Government support of Young Russian Scientists and four scientists received the grants from Foundation for Russian Science Support.

One of the important part of the INEOS RAS activity aimed at the future is the training of young specialists of high qualification. In 2003, a scientific educational centre “INEOS Department” was founded within the framework of the RAS Presidium Programme “Support for Young Scientists” and according to the resolution of the INEOS RAS Scientific Council. The goal of the Centre is to train a new generation of young highly educated specialists of wide profile who know modern research methods, on the basis of the priority scientific line performed at INEOS RAS.

The results of scientific research carried out at the Institute since 2008 have been summarized in more than 1500 scientific papers and 16 monographs. For the past five years, mutually beneficial contracts have been signed with numerous universities, institutes and industrial centres in Russia and abroad. Outstanding foreign scientists and representatives of science-oriented companies are frequent visitors to INEOS RAS. The Institute participates in several joint projects with foreign institutions and companies directed to research collaboration and commercialization of “know-how” and new synthesized products.

Within the recent years INEOS RAS participated in organization of more than 20 conferences, symposia, and seminars. The list of most important international meetings includes the following international conferences:

'''''Historical background'''''

At the INEOS’s earliest stages it was implied that synthetic work in organoelement and macromolecular chemistry should be combined with the necessity of relevant theoretical and physical investigations, and therefore many laboratories at INEOS are carrying out their research at the junction of several branches in chemistry and physics. This determines “the points of growth” which lead to progress in modern science and technology as A.N. Nesmeyanov used to say. Apart from traditional, scientific disciplines (to which the organoelement chemistry itself belongs too), valuable experience accumulated during these years has given rise to a series of new scientific fields which are characterized by a unique combination of organic, organoelement, coordination, physical chemistry, and chemistry of the macromolecular and natural biologically active compounds.

Thus, new branches in chemistry have appeared at the junction of organic, organometallic and coordination chemistry, namely the chemistry of the organic derivatives of the transition metals, p-complexes and clusters, asymmetric catalysis etc. The unique properties of these new compounds made it possible to develop new organometallic catalysts, to study an activation of small molecules, including molecular nitrogen, hydrocarbons, etc. Combination of organic and organoelement chemistry with the experimental and theoretical methods of physical chemistry promoted the development of relevant studies in reactivity, structural chemistry, catalysis and molecular dynamics of organoelement compounds.

The interaction between organophosphorus chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology made it possible to unlock the secrets of the mechanisms responsible for the action of organophosphorus compounds upon biological structures and living organisms. Significant progress has been also achieved in the field of new tumor-selective anticancer preparations and physiologically active organofluorine compounds.

The works at the junction of the organic and inorganic chemistry, studies of the processes of polymer formation as well as structure—property relations, brought about the chemistry of polymers with organoelement and inorganic molecular chains and opened the routes to novel classes of linear and network polymers. New materials with valuable thermal, catalytic, sorptional and electro-physical properties, engineering plastics, thermostable composites and adhesives, membranes and polymers for electronics and medicine have been made up on the basis of these polymers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5115">'''Non-repudiation''' refers to a situation where a statement's author cannot successfully dispute its authorship or the validity of an associated [[contract]]. The term is often seen in a legal setting when the authenticity of a signature is being challenged. In such an instance, the authenticity is being "repudiated".{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==In security==
In general, ''non-repudiation'' involves associating actions or changes with a unique individual. For example, a secure area may use a [[Keycard lock|key card access]] system. Here, non-repudiation would be violated if key cards were shared or if lost and stolen cards were not immediately reported. Similarly, the owner of a computer account must not allow others to use it, such as by giving away their password, and a policy should be implemented to enforce this. This prevents the owner of the account from denying actions performed by the account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Negus |first=Christopher |others=Contributions by Christine Bresnahan |title=Linux Bible |date=2012 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781118286906 |page=580 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0gL9poGWIIC&amp;lpg=PA580&amp;dq=linux%20bible%20Non-repudiation&amp;pg=PA580#v=onepage&amp;q=Non-repudiation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In digital security===
In [[information security|digital security]], non-repudiation means:&lt;ref&gt;[http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/778/687 Non-Repudiation in the Digital Environment (Adrian McCullagh)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*A service that provides proof of the [[Data integrity|integrity]] and [[Message authentication|origin of data]].
*An authentication that can be said to be genuine with high confidence.

Proof of data integrity is typically the easiest of these requirements to accomplish. A data [[Hash function|hash]] such as [[SHA2]] usually ensures that the data will not be changed undetectably. Even with this safeguard, it is possible to tamper with [[data in transit]], either through a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] or [[phishing]]. Because of this, data integrity is best asserted when the recipient already possesses the necessary verification information.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The most common method of verifying the digital origin of data is through [[digital certificates]], a form of [[public key infrastructure]] that includes [[digital signatures]]. Note that the public key scheme is not used for [[encryption]] in this form; the goal is not to achieve confidentiality since a message signed with a private key can be read by anyone using the public key. Verifying the digital origin means that the certified/signed data likely came from someone who possesses the private key corresponding to the signing certificate. If the key is not properly safeguarded by the original owner, digital forgery can occur.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Trusted third parties (TTPs)==
To mitigate the risk of people repudiating their own signatures, the standard approach is to involve a [[trusted third party]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The two most common TTPs are [[forensic analyst]]s and [[notary|notaries]]. A forensic analyst specializing in handwriting can compare some signature to a known valid signature and assess its legitimacy. A notary is a witness who verifies an individual's identity by checking other credentials and affixing their certification that the person signing is who they claim to be. A notary provides the extra benefit of maintaining independent logs of their transactions, complete with the types of credentials checked, and another signature that can be verified by the forensic analyst. This double security makes notaries the preferred form of verification.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

For digital information, the only TTP is the repository for [[public key certificate]]s. This lets the recipient verify the origin of an item even if the public information has ever been directly exchanged. The digital signature, however, is forensically identical in both legitimate and forged uses - if someone possesses the private key they can create a "real" signature. Protecting the private key is the idea behind the [[United States Department of Defense]]'s [[Common Access Card]] (CAC), which never lets the key leave the card. This means that, to use the card for encryption and digital signatures, a person needs the [[personal identification number]] (PIN) code necessary to unlock it.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[Image:Alpine valley.jpg|thumb|right|Alpine valley, like Oldest Dryas]]
The '''Oldest Dryas''' was a climatic period, which occurred during the coldest [[stadial]] after the [[Weichselian]] glaciation in north Europe. In the [[Alps]], the Oldest Dryas corresponds to the [[Gschnitz]] stadial of the [[Würm glaciation]]. The three “Dryas” periods (younger, older, oldest) are named for a marker species, ''[[Dryas octopetala]]'', detected in [[core sample]]s of glacial ice and [[peat bog]]s. The Oldest Dryas corresponds to [[pollen zone]] Ia.

==Dating==
[[Image:Greenland Kangerlussuaq icesheet.jpg|thumb|right|The edge of the ice in Greenland]]
The period was between 16,050-13,050 [[Before Christ|BC]], from Roberts, 1998. A date from [[Kilkeel]], [[Northern Ireland]], extends the start of the period to as early as 17,050 BC. A strong sequence of carbon-14 dates derived from layered material in the Hauterive/Rouges-Terres excavations on the northwest shore of [[Lake Neuchâtel]] in [[Switzerland]], 1992–1993, places the end of the Oldest Dryas at about 12,700 BC, calibrated. The same date from [[Antarctica]] and the south China sea is 14,600 and 14,700, respectively, and a [[Greenland]] ice core indicates 14,500. David Miles refers to the Oldest Dryas as the last [[Heinrich event]] (H1) and dates it to between 16,500 and 14,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David  |last=Miles  |title=The Tale of the Axe: How the Neolithic Revolution Transformed Britain |authorlink= |publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson|location = London, UK |year=2016 |page=79 |isbn=978-0-500-05186-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate standard to which all these dates are to be compared is the graph of the [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]s, which gives change in isotope concentration on the y-axis, with time on the x-axis. The graph plots many events that are sharply defined, but others are not. The selection of a terminal point is sometimes partially arbitrary.

The end of the Oldest Dryas is sharply defined. The beginning is a long, gently sloping band, probably no earlier than 17,050 BC, but the date might be set later by approximately 1000 years. Data derived from isotope variation of [[nitrogen]] and [[argon]] trapped in [[Greenland]] ice gives a high-resolution date for the end of the oldest Dryas at the sharp temperature rise of 14.67 ky BP.

[[Image:Lac de Neuchatel depuis la Neuchatel (ville suisse) dscn0660.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Neuchatel]]
The complete sequence of late [[Pleistocene]] climatic periods, defined for [[Northern Europe]], are the Oldest Dryas (stadial), the [[Bølling Oscillation|Bölling]] (interstadial), the [[Older Dryas]] (stadial), the [[Allerød Oscillation|Allerød]] (interstadial), and the [[Younger Dryas]] (stadial). The [[Holocene]] begins immediately afterward. The last three are also [[Blytt-Sernander]] periods.

Sometimes, the Older Dryas is missing, as in the [[Jura Mountains]] of [[France]], or it is negligible in the evidence. In that case, the initial part of the sequence appears to be Oldest Dryas (cold), Bølling-Allerød (warm), Younger Dryas (cold). The Bølling-Allerød corresponds to the [[Windermere]] interstadial in [[Great Britain|Britain]].

Often, however, the apparently-missing Older Dryas is a problem of resolution in the evidence. Some scientists have undertaken high-resolution studies, which combine a variety of climatological methods. They, like the ones conducted on [[Owens Lake|Owens]] and [[Mono Lake|Mono]] Lakes, in [[California]], usually detect the Older Dryas. Even when it is detected, it appears to be no more than a few centuries of slightly-cooler weather on the oxygen isotope ratio graph.

==Flora==
During the Oldest Dryas, Europe was treeless and similar to the Arctic [[tundra]], but much drier and grassier than the modern tundra. It contained shrubs and herbaceous plants such as the following:
:*[[Poaceae]], grasses
:*''[[Artemisia (plant)|Artemisia]]''
:*''[[Dwarf Birch|Betula nana]]'', dwarf birch
:*''[[Dwarf Willow|Salix retusa]]'', dwarf willow
:*''[[Dryas octopetala]]''
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Grasslands-menggu.jpg|Grassland ([[Inner Mongolia]])
Image:Artemisia_vulgaris_-_Köhler–s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-016.jpg|''Artemisia vulgaris''
Image:Betula nana0.jpg|''Betula nana''
Image:Mountainavens2.jpg|''Dryas octopetala''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Fauna==
Species were mainly Arctic but during the Glacial Maximum, the warmer weather species had withdrawn into refugia and began to repopulate Europe in the Oldest Dryas.

The brown bear, ''[[Brown bear|Ursos arctos]]'', was among the first to arrive in the north. Genetic studies indicate North European brown bears came from a refugium in the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] of [[Moldavia]]. Other refugia were in [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Greece]].

The bears would not have returned north except in pursuit of food. The tundra must already have been well populated. It is likely that the species hunted by humans at [[Lake Neuchâtel]] in [[Switzerland]] by the end of the period were present during it. Here are other animals present:

[[Aves]]
:*''[[Black-throated diver|Gavia arctica]]'', black-throated diver
:*''[[Black-necked grebe|Podiceps nigricollis]]'', black-necked grebe
:*''[[Whooper swan|Cygnus cygnus]]'', whooper swan
:*''[[Golden eagle|Aquila chrysaetos]]'', golden eagle
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Gavia arctica1.jpg|''Gavia arctica''
Image:Podiceps nigricollis naumann.jpg|''Podiceps nigricollis''
Image:Cygnus cygnus from zh.JPG|''Cygnus cygnus''
Image:Aquila chrysaetos large drawing.jpg|''Aquila chrysaetos''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The above birds are primarily maritime. They must have fed in the copious glacial waters of the north that were just beginning to be released.

[[Fish]]
:*''[[Burbot|Lota lota]]'', burbot
:*''[[Grayling (species)|Thymallus thymallus]]'', grayling
:*''[[Common Roach|Rutilus rutilus]]'', roach
:*''[[Trout|Salmo trutta]]'', trout
:*''[[Salvelinus]] alpinus'', char
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Tarfala.jpg|Glacial stream
Image:Trüsche Walchensee.jpg|''Lota lota''
Image:Bachforelle Zeichnung.jpg|''Salmo trutta''
Image:Röding, Iduns kokbok.jpg|''Salvelinus''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The smaller mammals of the food chain inhabited the herbaceous blanket of the tundra:

[[Cricetidae]]
:*''[[Lemming|Discrotonyx torquatus]]'', collared lemming
:*''[[Vole|Microtus oeconomus]]'', root vole
:*''[[Vole|Microtus arvalis]]'', common vole
:*''[[Vole|Chionmys nivalis]]'', snowy vole

[[Leporidae]]
:*''[[Mountain hare|Lepus timidus]]'', Arctic hare

[[Sciuridae]]
:*''[[Marmot|Marmota marmota]]'', marmot

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:TundraVole23.jpg|''Microtus oeconomus''
Image:Feldmaus Microtus arvalis.jpg|''Microtus arvalis''
Image:Arctic Hare.jpg|''Lepus timidus''
Image:Marmota marmota Alpes1.jpg|''Marmota marmota''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In addition to bears and birds were other predators of the following small animals:

[[Carnivora]]
:*''[[Lynx|Felis lynx]]'', lynx
:*''[[Arctic fox|Alopex lagopus]]'', Arctic fox
:*''[[Wolf|Canis lupus]]'', wolf

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Lynx lynx poing.jpg|Lynx (or Felis) lynx
Image:Alopex lagopus standing on Nizke Island.jpg|''Alopex lagopus''
Image:Canis lupus portrait.jpg|''Canis lupus''
Image:IcelandicHorseInWinter.jpg|Icelandic horse, perhaps like ''Equus ferus''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Humans were interested in the large mammals, which included:
:*''[[Reindeer|Rangifer tarandus]]'', reindeer
:*''[[Horse|Equus ferus]]'', wild horse

==Human prehistory==
[[Image:JomonPottery.JPG|thumb|right|Jōmon pottery]]
Human cultures in Europe were Upper [[Palaeolithic]] and belonged to [[Cro-Magnon]] man. [[Neanderthal]]s had long since disappeared by replacement or amalgamation with ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. The [[Magdalenian]] culture of reindeer hunters prevailed in Western Europe. From the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] eastward, the Epigravettian continued the prior [[Gravettian]]. In Japan, the [[Jōmon]] culture had already become sedentary and was producing some food, and possibly grew rice, but it was not at all urban. It was manufacturing the first known pottery.

One of the most remarkable discoveries of the period was the domestic wolf, a distinct breed of ''[[Canis lupus]]'', with smaller teeth. The domestic dog, ''[[Canis familiaris]]'', also has been found. It is thought that the animals helped with the hunting, but they would, by the nature of the hunt, have gradually become adept at herding.

Together with the [[St. Andrews Biological Station|St. Andrew's Biological Station]] in New Brunswick, the Pacific Biological Station was designated a [[Events of National Historic Significance (Canada)|National Historic Event]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/biological-station-gets-national-recognition/|title=Biological station gets national recognition - Nanaimo News Bulletin|date=2011-08-02|work=Nanaimo News Bulletin|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Its research facilities include the [[research vessel]] [[CCGS W. E. Ricker|CCGS ''W.E. Ricker'']] and an experimental fish farm.  Key research areas are stock assessment, [[aquaculture]], marine environment, habitat science, ocean science, and productivity.&lt;ref name="data.fptt-pftt.gc.ca2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.fptt-pftt.gc.ca/fedlabs/fedlab_e.cfm?id=164|title=Federal Labs Fisheries and Oceans Canada  Pacific Biological Station|date=2007-09-19|publisher=Federal Partners in Technology Transfer|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing [[elasmobranch]] research at the PBS includes [[basking shark]]s, skate tagging, Pacific Spiny Dogfish, [[Blue Shark]] tagging, and development of aging methods.&lt;ref name="PacificSharkResearchLab2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/species-especes/elasmobranch/index-eng.htm|title=Canadian Pacific Shark Research Lab|date=2011-04-07|publisher=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1984, Station researchers store their finding in the [[GFCATCH]] database, which holds a record of all specimens removed from fisheries for study. This system was later altered in 1991 to record trawl trips and other cruising information. GFCATCH has also added records of the station's cruising and trawling activities as well as shipping patterns since 1954. This data is gathered from both official ship logs and first-hand accounts from the crews and fishery scientists that attended those voyages. The database also keeps a catalog of the species that were studied on each expedition, ranging from [[Sponge|sea sponges]] and jelly fish to various arthropods, like shrimp. The list also categorizes various worm species, such as [[Leech|leeches]] and other [[Annelid|annelids]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The station conducts research expeditions and [[trawling]] missions along Canada's west coast, with expeditions to the [[Strait of Georgia]], [[Queen Charlotte Sound (Canada)|Queen Charlotte Sound]] and the [[Hecate Strait]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rutherford|first=K.L.|date=1999|title=Canadian Technical Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 2299: A brief history of GFCATCH (1954-1995), the groundfish catch and effort database at the Pacific Biological Station|url=|journal=Canadian Technical Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences|volume=2299|pages=1-66|via=Biological Abstracts 1969 - Present}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1944 and 2002, the [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada]] launched 652 research cruises from the station. These cruises allowed researchers direct access to the fisheries were they investigated various aquatic animals and their ecologies. One prominent species in the Station's research has been the groundfish. These research cruises are all cataloged using an online database, [[GFCruise]]. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinclair|first=C.A.|date=2002|title=Groundfish research cruises conducted by the Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 1944-2002.|url=|journal=Canadian Technical Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences|volume=2617|pages=1-91|via=Biological Abstracts 1969 - Present}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vessels chartered for these voyages included Investigator #1, which operated from January 1948 to November 1964. Other vessels included the AP Knight, [[G.B. Reed]], Ocean Traveller, [[Gambler 1]], Star Wars II, and [[Rupert Brand V]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Scientists and researchers from many different backgrounds worked at the station during its long tenure. These researchers included freshwater biologist [[Ferris Neave]], who worked at the station from 1939 until he retired in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/neave_f.shtml|title=Memorable Manitobans: Ferris Neave (1901-1986)|last=|first=|date=June 4, 2014|website=Manitoba Historical Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard J. Beamish, a Canadian fisheries scientists, served as a groundfish researcher and later director of the station from 1980 to 1993. Statistician also work with the researchers to measure stock assessments and fishery management. [[John T. Schnute]], a mathematician from [[Texas State University]], worked at the station for 28 years.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schnute|first=Jon T.|date=2005|title=Mathematics and fisheries: Match or mismatch?|url=|journal=Electronic Journal of Differential Equations|volume=12|pages=143-158|via=Directory of Open Access Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station celebrated its 100th year of research in 2008. The centennial celebration included guest lecturers [[Mark Angelo]] and [[Rick Troll]], and attract 20,000 visitors from multiple fields of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pices.int/publications/pices_press/volume16/v16_n2/pp_35_PBS100_f.pdf|title=Pacific Biological Station Celebrates Centennial Anniversary, 1908 – 2008|last=Thiess|first=Mary|date=|work=PICES Press|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration also included guided tours of the station's facilities, including a library and containers of circulating sea water to store specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Directory to Marine Laboratories of the United States and Canada|last=Hiatt|first=Robert W.|publisher=|year=1949|isbn=31822009444316|location=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Scientific Discoveries ==
A report from the Canadian Chemistry and Metallurgy journal found early studies from the station neglected to account for chemical factors in the fisheries they were observing This included the oxygen content of a specimen's habitat and the materials that make up the ocean sediment were many roundworms live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carter|first=Neal M.|date=September 1933|title=Scientific Problems of Canadian Fisheries|url=|journal=Canadian Chemistry and Metallurgy|volume=17|pages=188-190|via=Applied Science &amp; Technology Index Retrospective: 1913-1983 (H.W. Wilson)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies headed by Richard Beamish discovered new techniques for determining the ages of fish. This discovery has altered the way many fisheries monitor their stocks to prevent themselves from over harvesting. The study also found the [[Pacific ocean perch]] could live up to 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.science.ca/scientists/scientistprofile.php?pID=262|title=Richard J. Beamish|last=|first=|date=June 6, 2015|website=science.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Station fishery research has also contributed to mathematical studies to improve management of major Pacific fisheries. These studies also provided possible alternatives to existing fishery models and offer greater insight into the relationship between the fishery activities and the Pacific environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Pharmaceutical Research Institute (PRI)- Albany''' is an independent, not-for-profit research and development institute for research, pharmaceutical services and education at [[Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences]].

Under the direction of [[Shaker A. Mousa]], Ph.D., formerly a senior researcher at [[DuPont Pharmaceuticals Co]]., PRI-Albany conducts pre-clinical testing and clinical trials to develop drugs for transitioning to industrial manufacture. Through its research capabilities, PRI-Albany endeavors to introduce novel non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of vascular, oncological and neurological disorders.

Experimental research at the Pharmaceutical Research Institute focuses on identifying novel therapeutic and diagnostic strategies for unmet medical needs, with the initial focus on advancing the development of key concepts for vascular and cardiovascular diseases. In this area, initial research is concentrated on in vitro and in vivo models of angiogenesis, thrombosis and vascular biology. Investigation includes a search for new approaches to modulate angiogenesis in oncology, dermatology and ophthalmology.

An important strategic focus of the Pharmaceutical Research Institute is development of drug formulation and drug delivery units that will facilitate drug development for pharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations. These units will function as a resource partner for pharmaceutical and biotech industries operating under the Food and Drug Administration's current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and Good Laboratory Practices (GLP).

During drug discovery and early clinical development, it is essential to have multiple mechanism-related readouts that predict successful clinical outcomes. This segment of research at the Pharmaceutical Research Institute provides key information that will help bridge the gap between experimental and clinical results. Additionally, this segment provides surrogates that are linked to clinical outcomes.

Some activities include identifying potent integrin ligands and other biological targets for therapeutic and diagnostic applications; establishing screening strategy, endothelial cell migration, proliferation, tube information and in vitro neovascularization models; establishing the CAM assay for angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis; screening for anti-platelet and anti-coagulant potency; and collaborating with different groups in search of novel strategies.

'''Play Money''' (PM) is noticeably fake [[banknotes|bills]] or [[coins]] intended to be used use as [[toy]] [[currency]], especially for classroom instruction or as a marker in [[board game]]s such as [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], rather than currency in a legitimate [[exchange market]]. Play money coins and bills are collected widely. They can be found made from metals, cardboard or, more frequently today, plastic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plastic-play-money.org&lt;/ref&gt; For [[card game]]s such as [[poker]], [[casino token]]s are commonly used instead.

Many [[online gambling]] sites offer "play money" games which can be played for freely-obtainable credits. These are usually offered alongside "real money" games. However, some sites also offer software that only offers play money games. Such software is usually downloadable from a parallel [[.net]] web address, which can then be advertised to the general public as a non-gambling website{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

In 1997, the [[Winston Million]] (a cash prize award program on the NASCAR Winston Cup series) was won by Jeff Gordon at the Mountain Dew Southern 500.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3218">'''SEETEP''' stands for  Solar Energy and Environmental Education Program. It is a project being run in Mawere District located in the [[Nyanza Province]]  of Kenya. Its purpose is to build  a self-sustaining solar energy and water management school in the area by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;"About Seetep", http://seetep.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=4, Retrieved  2012-03-08,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception==

Since 1992 [[Arc Aid and Arc Kenya|ARC-Aid and ARC-Kenya]] have been running their development programs in Kenya through offices based in Majiwe District at the ARO Development Centre.&lt;ref&gt;"ARO Development Centre", http://www.arc-aid.no/aro-development-centre/, Retrieved 2012-03-08&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to make the centre more environmentally sustainable a partnership agreement was struck with [https://web.archive.org/web/20120415011530/http://www.elkem.no/eway/default.aspx?pid=241 Elkem Solar]. Elkem installed solar panels in  ARO Development Centre which is  very close to the equator and thus in a prime position for Elkem to simultaneously  carry out research and development on the solar panels. The partnership was possible since both ARC-Aid and Elkem Solar are based in Kristiansand.

ARC-Aid has also entered a partnership with [http://www.kvadraturen.vgs.no/ Kvadraturen School](also in Kristiansand) which has an alternative energy department. Every year a teacher and some students from this department travel to Kenya to gain some practical experience on solar panel maintenance and installation. Elkem Solar later expanded its installation program and laid down solar panels in [https://www.google.no/search?aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=kisumu+polytechnic Kisumu Polytechnic] a technical school located in Nyanza. The interaction of these four partners led to the identification of a need for a school specialising in Solar Energy Technology and Water Resources Management. Elkem Solar would provide technical assistance to the school, Kvadraturen and Kisumu Polytechnic would develop the curriculum for the school while ARC-Aid and ARC-Kenya would coordinate the efforts of the different organisations.

[[Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation|NORAD]] is funding the project as part of their development activities. [http://www.vaf.no/hoved.aspx?m=8&amp;amid=59171 Vest-Agder County Municipality] has also pledged their support, donating funds and seeking other ways of involvement.

==Progress==

In 2010 the project officially began with the granting of funds by NORAD for a pilot project and the carrying out of feasibility research. The land on which the school will be built was acquired in 2011. The plot of land is located in Mawere District which is 100 kilometres from Kisumu. Construction has begun on the school using materials that have been developed in Kisumu Polytechnic.&lt;ref&gt;"Seetep Progress", http://seetep.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=7,Retrieved 2012-05-03&lt;/ref&gt; A delegation from Kisumu Polytechnic will be visiting Kristiansand in the month of May in order to discuss the way forward with Kvadraturen School and ARC-Aid.

The relative [[position of the Sun]] is a major factor in the [[solar gain|heat gain]] of buildings and in the performance of [[solar energy]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/rredc/solar_resource.html|title=Solar Resource Information|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=2009-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accurate location-specific knowledge of sun path and climatic conditions is essential for economic decisions about [[solar thermal collector|solar collector]] area, orientation, landscaping, summer shading, and the cost-effective use of [[solar tracker]]s.&lt;ref name="SunModel"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://sites.google.com/site/khavrus/public-activities/SolarEng|last=Khavrus|first=V.|title=Introduction to solar motion geometry on the basis of a simple model|year=2010|journal=Physics Education|volume=45|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/45/6/010|page=641|last2=Shelevytsky|first2=I.|issue=6|bibcode=2010PhyEd..45..641K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SunModel2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://sites.google.com/site/khavrus/public-activities/seasons|last=Khavrus|first=V.|title=Geometry and the physics of seasons|year=2012|journal=Physics Education|volume=47|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/47/6/680|page=680|last2=Shelevytsky|first2=I.|issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect of the Earth's axial tilt ==
{{very long section|date=June 2017}}
Sun paths at any latitude and any time of the year can be determined from basic [[geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://notesfromnoosphere.blogspot.com/2012/05/simple-geometry-of-sun-paths.html |title=Notes from Noosphere: The simple geometry of sun, moon, and star paths |first=Helluo |last=Librorum  |work=notesfromnoosphere.blogspot.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2014|reason=Anyone could create a pseudonymous blog such as this.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth's axis of [[Earth's rotation|rotation]] tilts about [[Axial tilt#Earth|23.5 degrees]], relative to the [[ecliptic|plane]] of [[Earth's orbit]] around the [[Sun]]. As the Earth orbits the Sun, this creates the 47° [[declination]] difference between the [[solstice]] sun paths, as well as the [[Sphere#hemisphere|hemisphere]]-specific difference between summer and winter.

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the winter sun (November, December, January) rises in the southeast, [[culmination|transits]] the [[celestial meridian]] at a low angle in the south (more than 43° above the southern horizon in the tropics), and then sets in the southwest. It is on the south (equator) side of the house all day long. A vertical window facing south (equator side) is effective for capturing [[solar thermal energy]]. For comparison, the winter sun in the Southern Hemisphere (May, June, July) rises in the northeast, peaks out at a low angle in the north (more than halfway up from the horizon in the tropics), and then sets in the northwest. There, the north-facing window would let in plenty of solar thermal energy to the house.

In the Northern Hemisphere in summer (May, June, July), the Sun rises in the northeast, peaks out slightly south of overhead point (lower in the south at higher [[latitude]]), and then sets in the northwest, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere in summer (November, December, January), the Sun rises in the southeast, peaks out slightly north of overhead point (lower in the north at higher latitude), and then sets in the southwest. A simple latitude-dependent equator-side overhang can easily be designed to block 100% of the direct solar gain from entering vertical equator-facing windows on the hottest days of the year. Roll-down exterior shade screens, interior translucent-or-opaque window quilts, drapes, shutters, movable trellises, etc. can be used for hourly, daily or seasonal sun and heat transfer control (without any active electrical air conditioning).

Everywhere around the world during the equinoxes (March 20/21 and September 22/23) except for the poles, the sun rises due east and sets due west. In the Northern Hemisphere, the equinox sun peaks in the southern half (about halfway up from the horizon at mid latitude) of the sky, while in the Southern Hemisphere, that sun peaks in the northern half of the sky. When facing the equator, the sun appears to move from left to right in the Northern Hemisphere and from right to left in the Southern Hemisphere.

The latitude (and hemisphere)-specific solar path differences are critical to effective passive solar building design. They are essential data for optimal window and overhang seasonal design. Solar designers must know the precise solar path angles for each location they design for, and how they compare to place-based seasonal heating and cooling requirements.

In the U.S., the precise location-specific altitude-and-azimuth seasonal solar path numbers are available from [[NOAA]] – the "equator side" of a building is south in the Northern Hemisphere, and north in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], where the peak summer [[solstice]] solar altitude occurs on December 21. 

=== Shadow of Vertical Stick at Solar Noon ===
On the equator, the sun will be straight overhead and a vertical stick will cast no shadow at [[solar noon]] on the [[equinox]]es. On the vernal equinox, north of the [[subsolar point]] (on the equator) the vertical stick's shadow will point a little westwards of true north (NNW) reading 336.5° from true north and little eastwards of true south (SSE) reading 156.5° from true north. On the autumnal equinox, north of the subsolar point (on the equator), the shadow will point a little eastwards of true north (NNE) reading 23.5° from true north (and south of the subsolar, the shadow will point a little westward of true south (SSW) reading 203.5° from true north).

The same stick will cast no shadow on the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere when the subsolar point is on the [[Tropic of Cancer]] 23.44° north of equator. Although north of 23.44°N the shadow will point towards true north and south of 23.44°N the shadow will point towards true south. The reverse occurs on the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere when the subsolar point will be on the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] 23.44°S and a vertical stick will cast no shadow along that point. But north of the Tropic of Capricorn solar noon shadows will point towards true north and south of the Tropic of Capricorn shadows will point towards true south.

The solar noon shadows of objects on points beyond and below subsolar points will point towards true north and true south respectively only when the solar [[declination]] has its maximum positive (δ☉ = +23.44°) or maximum negative (δ☉ = −23.44°) value. On the other hand, on the equinoxes when the sun is neither declined north nor south (δ☉ = 0°) and solar time noon shadows point NNW north of the equator and SSE south of the equator on the vernal equinox (and point NNE north of the equator and SSW south of the equator on the autumnal equinox).

===Duration of daylight===
Within the [[polar circle]]s (north of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]]), each year will experience at least one day when the Sun remains below the [[horizon]] for 24 hours (on the [[winter solstice]]), and at least one day when the Sun remains above the horizon for 24 hours (on the [[summer solstice]]).

In the [[middle latitudes]] (between the [[tropics]] and the [[polar circle]]s, where most humans live), the length of [[daytime]], as well as [[solar zenith angle|solar altitude]] and [[solar azimuth angle|azimuth]], vary from one day to the next, and from season to season. The difference between the lengths of a long summer day and of a short winter day increases as one moves farther away from the [[Equator]].&lt;ref name="SunModel" /&gt;

== Building design simulation ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
Before the days of modern, inexpensive, 3D computer graphics, a [[heliodon]] (precisely-movable light source) was used to show the angle of the sun on a physical model of a proposed building. Today, mathematical computer models calculate location-specific solar gain (shading) and seasonal thermal performance, with the ability to rotate and animate a 3D color graphic model of a proposed building design.

Heating and cooling issues in [[passive solar building design]] can be [[counterintuitive]]. Precise performance calculations and simulations are essential to avoid [[reinventing the wheel]] and duplicating expensive experimental design errors, such as skylights that turn a building into a [[solar furnace]] in summer (see [[Daylighting#Sawtooth roof]]).

==Visualization==
The pictures below show the following perspectives from Earth, marking the hourly [[position of the Sun|positions]] of the [[Sun]] on both [[solstice]] days. When connected, the suns form two '''day arcs''', the paths along which the Sun appears to follow on the [[celestial sphere]] in its [[diurnal motion]]. The longer arc is always the midsummer path while the shorter arc the midwinter path. The two arcs are 46.88° (2 × 23.44°) apart, indicating the [[declination]] difference between the solstice suns.

In addition, some "ghost" suns are visible below the [[horizon]], as much as 18° down, during which [[twilight]] occurs. The pictures can be used for both the northern and the southern [[hemispheres of Earth]]. A theoretical observer is supposed to stand near the tree on a small island in the middle of the sea. The green arrows represent the [[cardinal direction]]s.
* In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], north is to the left. The Sun rises in the east (far arrow), [[culmination|culminates]] in the south (to the right) while moving to the right, and sets in the west (near arrow). Both rise and set positions are displaced towards the north in midsummer and the south in midwinter.
* In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], south is to the left. The Sun rises in the east (near arrow), culminates in the north (to the right) while moving to the left, and sets in the west (far arrow). Both rise and set positions are displaced towards the south in midsummer and the north in midwinter.

The following selected cases are depicted.
* On the abstract line of the [[Equator]] (90° latitude), the Sun's maximum altitude is great during the entire year, but it does not form a perfect [[right angle]] with the ground at noon everyday. In fact it happens two days of the year, during the equinoxes. The solstices are the dates that the Sun stays farthest away from the [[zenith]] but anyway also in those cases it's high in the sky, reaching an altitude of 66.56° either to the north or the south. All days of the year, solstices included, have the same length of 12 hours.
* Solstice day arcs as viewed from 20° [[latitude]]. The Sun culminates at 46.56° altitude in winter and 93.44° altitude in summer. In this case an angle larger than 90° means that the culmination takes place at an altitude of 86.56° in the opposite cardinal direction. For example, in the southern hemisphere, the Sun remains in the north during winter, but can reach over the zenith to the south in midsummer. Summer days are longer than winter days, but approximately the difference is no more than only two and a half hours. The daily path of the Sun is steep at the horizon the whole year round, resulting in a twilight of only about one hour and 20 minutes in the morning and in the evening.
* Solstice day arcs as viewed from 50° latitude. During the winter solstice Sun does not rise more than 16.56° above the horizon at midday, but 63.44° in summer solstice above the same horizon direction. The difference in the length of the day between summer and winter, from here to the north, begin to be striking – slightly more than 8 hours at winter solstice, to more than 16 hours during the summer solstice. Likewise is the difference in direction of sunrise and sunset.  At this latitude at midnight (around 1 a.m. with summer legal hour) the summer sun is 16.56° below the horizon, which means that ''astronomical twilight'' continues the whole night. This phenomenon is known as the ''[[wiktionary:grey night|grey nights]]'', nights when it does not get dark enough for [[astronomers]] to do their observations of the [[deep sky]]. Above 60° latitude, the Sun would be even closer to the horizon, only 6.56° away from it. Then ''civil twilight'' continues almost all night, only a little bit of ''nautical twilight'' obviously around the local midnight. And above 66.56° latitude, there is no sunset at all, a phenomenon referred to as the [[midnight sun]].
* Solstice day arcs as viewed from 70° latitude. At local noon the winter Sun culminates at −3.44°, and the summer Sun at 43.44°. Said another way, during the winter the Sun does not rise above the horizon, it is the [[polar night]]. There will be still a strong twilight though. At local midnight the summer Sun culminates at 3.44°, said another way, it does not set, it is the polar day.
* Solstice day arcs as viewed from [[geographic pole|either pole]] (90° latitude). At the time of the summer or winter solstices, the Sun is 23.44° degrees above or below the horizon, respectively, irrespective of time of day. Whilst the Sun is up (during summer months) it will circle around the whole sky (clockwise from the [[North Pole]] and counter-clockwise from the [[South Pole]]), appearing to stay at the same angle from the horizon, therefore the concept of day or night is meaningless. The angle of elevation will gradually change on an annual cycle, with the Sun reaching its highest point at the summer solstice, and rising or setting at the [[equinox]], with extended periods of twilight lasting several days after the autumn equinox and before the spring equinox.

The Archaeology Discover Centre formerly '''Sunken Secrets''', formerly the '''Underwater Archaeology Centre''' is a [[museum]] located in [[Fort Victoria (Isle of Wight)|Fort Victoria]] on the [[Isle of Wight]], [[England]].

The museum is run by archaeologists based on the Isle of Wight.  It is housed in five of the fort's former [[casemate]]s. Since it was opened in 1990 the museum has been used to display exhibits recovered from several local [[shipwreck]]s and the submerged landscapes of the [[Solent]]. These include the wrecks of [[HMS Pomone (1805)|HMS ''Pomone'']], [[HMS Invincible (1747)|HMS ''Invincible'']], the [[Yarmouth Roads Wreck]] and [[Bouldnor Cliff]].  The museum also houses an exhibition about the history of Fort Victoria itself.

Like most attractions in the fort the museum only operates from Easter to autumn, during which time it opens daily and occasionally holds activity and community events which are advertised at the fort, on Twitter and in local press.

==History==
After the wreck of [[HMS Pomone (1805)|HMS ''Pomone'']] was discovered at [[The Needles]] in 1969, the [[Isle of Wight Council]] funded a team to research and excavate the site.&lt;ref name=M52&gt;Medland, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984 another wreck was discovered immediately offshore of [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]] and work began excavating that site as well.&lt;ref name=M52/&gt; In 1990 the Isle of Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology was founded and began operating a museum at [[Fort Victoria (Isle of Wight)|Fort Victoria]] called the '''Maritime Heritage Exhibition'''. Several finds from the excavations were displayed in the museum, whilst others went to the [[Royal Naval Museum]] in Portsmouth and [[Bembridge Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref name=M52/&gt;

In 1991 the Trust expanded into the [[Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology]], a charity which went on to investigate more maritime archaeology in the local area and discovered the site of [[Bouldnor Cliff]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/6928293.stm|title=Fight on to save Stone Age Atlantis|publisher=BBC| date=2007-08-08|accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Trust refurbished the museum which was re-opened in 2006 as the Underwater Archaeology Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite sign|title=The Underwater Archaeology Centre|url= |date=2006|medium=Plaque outside museum|publisher=The Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology|location=[[Fort Victoria (Isle of Wight)|Fort Victoria]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 it was renamed Sunken Secrets. In 2017 the ownership of the centre passed into local hands.

==Exhibits==
'''Shipwrecks''': The shipwrecks exhibition explores why there are so many wrecks in the Solent area, why wrecks are seen as acting as time capsules of the past, and displays finds from Trust excavations.&lt;ref name=B113&gt;Burdett &amp; Insole, p 113&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the stories of HMS ''Pomone'', HMS ''Invincible'', the [[Yarmouth Roads Wreck]] (believed to be the Spanish Galleon ''Santa Lucia''),&lt;ref name=M52/&gt; and other wrecks at the Needles and [[Alum Bay]].&lt;ref name=SS&gt;{{cite web |title= Sunken Secrets - Current Exhibitions|url=http://sunkensecrets.hwtma.org.uk/currentexhibitions |publisher= Maritime Archaeology Trust|accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Submerged landscapes''': The submerged landscapes exhibits explain the history of the Solent as a dry river valley before rising sea levels flooded it and created the [[strait]] that exists today.&lt;ref name=B113/&gt; It focuses on the Trust's excavations at Bouldnor Cliff and includes artefacts recovered from the sea bed.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;

'''History of Fort Victoria''': Fort Victoria does not have a museum of its own, but an exhibition within Sunken Secrets details its history and its role in the defence of the [[Needles Passage]].&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;

The museum also contains information about the actual practice of maritime archaeology.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;

'''Time Structured Mapping''' (TSM) is a [[musical notation|score based]] system created and used by the composer [[Pete M Wyer|Pete M. Wyer]]. It uses the [[bar (music)|bar-lines]] found in conventional musical scores to indicate durational periods during which performers, who may include actors, singers, dancers, poets as well as musicians, are given instructions, which may include conventional musical scoring or [[improvisation]]al guidelines (see: [[musical improvisation]]).
The system allows large and sometimes disparate groups to improvise together coherently, or to combine improvisation with scored music or with other media. It has been used to get orchestras, including the [[Orchestra of the Swan]] (see below), to improvise effectively and in educational projects, to combine student musicians with professionals, such as with [[Welsh National Opera]] and to combine other media such as dance and poetry with musical improvisation in a structured form, such as with [http://www.mirodancetheatre.org/ Miro Dance Theatre], Philadelphia.

The flexibility of the system has allowed for the combination of musicians from very different backgrounds, as well as disparate ensembles with players of very different standards. Works generally combine improvisation with conventional scoring and move frequently from one system to the other. The synchronisation using 'clock-time' as a basis has also enabled works made up of players who are spatially separated such as with ''Four Bridges'' which was performed simultaneously in Britain, Germany, America and India, it allows for  works which alter the conventional relationship of the composer with the musician by involving the performer directly into the creative process.

== Beginnings - The Simultaneity Project ==
In 2004 Wyer began creating [[Simultaneity]] works: works that made recordings at the same time in different locations. The first recordings took place around [[Columbus Circle]], New York – Wyer mapped out a circumference that passed through the Time Warner building and around the periphery of Columbus Circle itself and, with the help of a team of volunteer staff from [[WNYC]] radio, made a series of simultaneous recordings that, when played back across multiple speakers, gave what he described as a ‘God’s ear view’ of the location – the experience of being at all points simultaneously; cars, subway trains and people moved from speaker to speaker, featuring the endless rotation of revolving doors that interfaced the very contrasting sonic landscape of the interior of the [[Time Warner Building]] with the bustling Manhattan streets outside.

This led to Simultaneity recordings that were not made in the same location: in December 2004, with volunteers primarily from [[Canadian Electroacoustic Community|CEC]] Canada’s online forum, a recording was made simultaneously in countries around the world:  volunteers were asked to record exactly the same twenty minutes of their environment wherever they were in the world, regardless of time-zone, but to include something that marked the hour changing. Volunteers recorded  dawn choruses (Australia), tolling bells (Australia), railway station announcements (New Zealand), clocks in a clock shop (San Francisco), ambient sound in Police Square (Manhattan), evening traffic (Berlin),  the backstage at English National Opera (London) late night rains (Tunis)  late night chatter (Mumbai), the sounds of the jungle (Laos),  dogs barking (northern Alaska). Resulting in a complex array of sounds that coalesced into a moment of intensity as the hour struck and then dissipated back to the disparate ambient environments.

== Time structured mapping ==
In his search to incorporate the philosophy of Simultaneity within western musical systems, Wyer returned to a frequent inspiration; birdsong;  struck by the endless combinations and re-combinations of the songs of the dawn chorus he began considering ways to create systems that would enable simultaneous solos that combined in musically intelligent, coherent ways - that necessarily moved away from the western convention of counting a beat for each bar.

In 2005 Wyer made his first Time Structured Maps using the same basic scores as might be used for an orchestra but where each bar-line represented a period of 30 seconds rather than a count and each ‘bar’ consisted of a set of instructions for how to improvise during that time period, which might be very specific or left ambiguous. The result was a system that enabled musicians from all backgrounds to play together, and to incorporate other forms such as dance, speech etc. within a score.

The first significant work for the system was for the Orchestra of the Swan with a Time Structured Map (TSM) based work called Traveller, ''There Are No Paths, Paths Are Made By Walking'' created in the summer of 2005.
A second, much more ambitious work, Four Bridges, was performed in November 2005, it combined the ideas of Simultaneity with the Time Structured Mapping system: the Orchestra of the Swan played from the score in England while pianist Burkhard Finke in Frankfurt, microtonal vocal specialist [[Toby Twining]] in Boston and Indian Classical singer Anand Thakore in Mumbai performed simultaneously from the same score, without hearing each other – each performance was recorded and later combined into a work for 8 speakers, which was later broadcasrt on [[WNYC|WNYC New Sounds]].

In 2009, Time Structured Mapping was used for the creation of the one-hour ''Insomnia Poems'' for BBC Radio 3 ([[BBC Radio 3|Jazz On 3]]) &lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio 3 Jazz On 3.{{full|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combined post-beat poet [[Steve Dalachinsky]] with a five-piece band consisting of soprano, Evelyne Beech, electronics and processing, Mike Cross, clarinets and saxes, [[Christopher Cundy|Chris Cundy]], bass, Robert Perry and Pete M Wyer on guitar, piano with found sounds and manipulations – each performing with a synchronized stopwatch. The piece was popularly received, retaining the energy and spontaneity of improvisation within the dynamic and tonal structure of a conventionally scored piece.

Further development, funded by the [[Arts Council England|Arts Council Of England]], enabled workshops which in turn led to new works using the system: Welsh National Opera &lt;ref&gt;Welsh National Opera.{{full|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; used it for a series of educational works alongside their 2010 UK tour, the [http://www.orchestraoftheswan.org Orchestra of the Swan] also using TSM scores for ''Four Sonnets'', a twenty-minute work created in July 2010 which combined improvisation within the orchestra with text fragments submitted according to the score from members of the public and ''Listening To The Sky', ''a one hour work for chamber group with sound design, which used a TSM score to combine orchestra performance with sounds created according to the Time Structured Map''.

'''Training Analysis''' (sometimes called '''Training Needs Analysis''' (TNA)) is the process of identifying the gap in employee training and related training needs.

== Introduction ==
Training Need Analysis(TNA) is the process of identifying the gap between employee training and needs of training. Training needs analysis is the first stage in the training process and involves a procedure to determine whether training will indeed address the problem which has been identified. Training can be described as “the acquisition of skills, concepts or attitudes that result in improved performance within the job environment”. Training needs analysis looks at each aspect of an operational domain so that the initial skills, concepts and attitudes of the human elements of a system can be effectively identified and appropriate training can be specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dirjournal.com/guides/how-to-conduct-a-training-needs-analysis/|title=How to Conduct a Training Needs Analysis|publisher=Directory Journal|accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Training needs analysis is most often used as part of the system development process. Due to the close tie between the design of the system and the training required, in most cases it runs alongside the development to capture the training requirements.

==Design Integrated Training Analysis==
Tools and methods for an integrated approach, [[Design Integrated Training Analysis]], have been proposed and developed. The trade-offs between design and training are both assessed in light of the understanding of the operational tasks. This approach also uses information on recorded critical incidents to review proposed training and to provide traceability between hazards and training. This single, integrated approach to human factors and training needs analysis has been successfully used on a number of defence projects.

==Training Analysis Process==
Over the last 20 years the critical nature of the [[man-in-the-loop]] has changed from simply manual dexterity and procedural operation to a state in which their decision making, cognitive abilities, [[data assimilation]], communication skills, and attitude are all crucial. In addition the job structure of the personnel operationally involved with modern systems has diversified in direct proportion to the complexity of the technology.   This has fueled the need for a formal approach.

The task of training can be broken down into a number of discrete components, each addressing a different part of the overall learning process. This breakdown is as follows:-
* Psycho-motor Skills
* Procedural Skills
* Knowledge Transfer
* Communication Skills
* Colossal Thinking
* Attitude Learning
* Performance Training
* Physiological Stresses

The role of training analysis is to build a formal bridge between the available design data and the training media and training objectives, in order to facilitate the [[transfer of training]] elements into the operational environment.

For complex multi-user system a user-to-task map is often constructed to present the relationship between the tasks and the identified team structure and also to identify new groups of users that would need to have an understanding of the system. The training gap is assessed by a comparison between the goals and tasks undertaken by the individuals and the existing training.

There is a wide variety of training media that can be used, ranging from traditional lecture-based teaching to sophisticated simulators. Different media will be more or less appropriate for different activities. It is necessary to determine the most suitable and cost-effective training media for the different areas.

There have been many different approaches defined, however, the system approach to training has been the most successful.

Training Needs Analysis (TNA) is defined as the “Identification of training requirements and the most cost effective means of meeting those requirements”.

A TNA should always be performed where a major new development in policy, equipment acquisition or procedures is deemed to have potential impact upon the current training regime.

TST has considerable experience of successfully employing the accepted techniques applied to the development of training systems, including the [[Systems Approach to Training]] (SAT) in both the defence and civilian domains using customer specific standards such as JSP 822 where required.

Carrying out all TNA activates in accordance with SAT principles ensures rigorous visibility in each design stage with clear audit trails from the initial Scoping Study through to the recommended solution.

== Benefits ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6259">The '''Universal Soil Loss Equation''' (USLE) is a widely used [[mathematical model]] that describes [[soil erosion]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hudson, Norman|title=Field Measurement of Soil Erosion and Runoff, Issue 68|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|year=1993|isbn=9789251034064|pages=121–126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rS1fiFU3rOwC&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erosion models play critical roles in soil and [[water]] resource [[conservation ethic|conservation]] and [[nonpoint source pollution]] assessments, including: [[sediment]] load assessment and inventory, conservation planning and design for [[sediment control]], and for the advancement of scientific understanding. The USLE or one of its derivatives are main models used by [[United States]] government agencies to measure water erosion.&lt;ref&gt;National Resources Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture. Washington, DC. {{USFR|61|27998}} "Technical Assistance." 1996-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

The USLE was developed in the U.S., based on soil erosion data collected beginning in the 1930s by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
([[USDA]]) Soil Conservation Service (now the USDA [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wischmeier, W.H. and D.D. Smith.  1978. [http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/ad_hoc/36021500USLEDatabase/AH_537.pdf "Predicting Rainfall Erosion Losses: A Guide to Conservation Planning."] Agriculture Handbook No. 537.  USDA/Science and Education Administration, US. Govt. Printing Office, Washington, DC. 58pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wischmeier, W. H., and D. D. Smith, 1960. "A universal soil-loss equation to guide conservation farm planning." ''Trans. Int. Congr. Soil Sci.,'' 7th, p. 418-425.&lt;/ref&gt; The model has been used for decades for purposes of conservation planning both in the United States where it originated and around the world, and has been used to help implement the United States' multibillion-dollar conservation program.  The '''Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation''' (RUSLE)&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service. 2014. [http://www.ars.usda.gov/Research/docs.htm?docid=5971 "Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) - Welcome to RUSLE 1 and RUSLE 2"].&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation''' (MUSLE) continue to be used for similar purposes.

==Overview of erosion models==
The two primary types of erosion models are process-based models and [[empirical model|empirically]] based models.  Process-based (physically based) models mathematically describe the erosion processes of detachment, transport, and [[Deposition (chemistry)|deposition]] and through the solutions of the equations describing those processes provide estimates of [[soil loss]] and [[sediment yield]]s from specified land surface areas.  Erosion science is not sufficiently advanced for there to exist completely process-based models which do not include empirical aspects.  The primary indicator, perhaps, for differentiating process-based from other types of erosion models is the use of the sediment continuity equation discussed below.  Empirical models relate management and environmental factors directly to soil loss and/or sedimentary yields through statistical relationships.  Lane et al.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, L.J., E.D. Shirley, and V.P. Singh. 1988. "Modeling erosion on hillslopes." p.287-308. In: M.G. Anderson (ed.) "Modeling Geomorphological Systems." John Wiley, Publ., NY.&lt;/ref&gt; provided a detailed discussion regarding the nature of process-based and empirical erosion models, as well as a discussion of what they termed [[conceptual model]]s, which lie somewhere between the process-based and purely empirical models.  Current research effort involving erosion modeling is weighted toward the development of process-based erosion models.  On the other hand, the standard model for most erosion assessment and conservation planning is the empirically based USLE, and there continues to be active research and development of USLE-based [[erosion prediction]] technology.

==Description of USLE==
The USLE was developed from erosion plot and rainfall simulator experiments.  The USLE is composed of six factors to predict the long-term average annual soil loss (A).  The equation includes the [[rainfall]] erosivity factor (R), the soil [[erodibility]] factor (K), the [[topographic]] factors (L and S) and the cropping management factors (C and P).  The equation takes the simple product form:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = R K L S C P&lt;/math&gt;
The USLE has another concept of experimental importance, the unit plot concept.  The unit plot is defined as the standard plot condition to determine the soil's [[erodibility]].  These conditions are when the LS factor = 1 (slope = 9% and length = 72.6 feet) where the plot is [[fallow]] and [[tillage]] is up and down slope and no conservation practices are applied (CP=1).  In this state:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;K = A/R&lt;/math&gt;
A simpler method to predict K was presented by Wischmeier et al.&lt;ref&gt;Wischmeier, W.H., C.B. Johnson, and B.V. Cross. 1971. "A soil erodibility nomograph for farmland and construction sites."  ''[[Journal of Soil and Water Conservation]]'' 26:189-193. {{issn|1941-3300}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the particle size of the soil, organic matter content, soil structure and profile permeability.  The soil erodibility factor K can be approximated from a [[nomograph]] if this information is known.  The LS factors can easily be determined from a slope effect chart by knowing the length and gradient of the slope.  The cropping management factor (C) and conservation practices factor (P) are more difficult to obtain and must be determined empirically from plot data.  They are described in soil loss ratios (C or P with / C or P without).
