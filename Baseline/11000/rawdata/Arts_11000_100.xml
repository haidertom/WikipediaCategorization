The Nazi party used cartoons and caricatures as a main part of their [[propaganda]] regime and as an effective way to send out their message and spread their opinions across Germany. The use of caricatures was a popular method within the party when pursuing their campaign against America, in particular President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

==Nazi cartoons and caricatures==
Cartoons and caricatures were an important part of Nazi propaganda. ''[[Der Stürmer]]'' provided a great platform for the party to publish their cartoons. [[Philipp Rupprecht]] was the newspapers lead cartoonist, drawing over one thousand anti-Semitic cartoons during his career. Although his style is reported to have changed throughout his years of work, his caricatures always depicted Jews as the Nazi stereotype: short, fat, ugly, unshaven, drooling, sexually perverted, bent-nosed and with pig like eyes. This shows how caricatures worked to the advantage of the Nazi party, allowing them to portray what they wanted in a way which photographs couldn't. A photograph would show a Jew as a human, whereas caricatures meant the Nazi party could portray Jews as inhumane in cartoon form. The cartoons intended to spread the create widespread support for Nazi ideology, in this case, anti-Americanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/whqr5_rwn32o/nazi-cartoons/|title=Nazi Cartoons|website=prezi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of Propaganda between Germany and the USA==
There were several events subsequent to Hitler coming into power which created the relationship which led to the hostile propaganda between Germany and America.

===The Nazi Boycott of Jewish businesses in April 1933. ===
When word of the [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses]] reached America, the [[American Jewish Committee]] and [[American Jewish Congress]] called an emergency meeting. Here it was decided America would protest the boycott. On March 27, protest rallies occurred in New York; Chicago; Boston; Philadelphia; Baltimore; Cleveland and 70 other locations. The Nazi party denounced this as ‘slander' generated by Jews of German origin and announced a campaign of sharp countermeasures against the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/The_Anti-Nazi_Boycott.html|title=1933 Anti-Nazi Boycott|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1936 Summer Olympics===
As the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] were held in Berlin, Germany there was great controversy over whether or not America should participate. Although it was decided by the US Olympic Committee that America was to participate, this decision was deplored by several American diplomats including [[William E. Dodd]], the American ambassador to Berlin, and [[George Messersmith]], head of the US legation in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007087|title=The Movement to Boycott the Berlin Olympics of 1936|website=www.ushmm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German American Bund===
[[German American Bund]] was an organisation of ethnic Germans living in the United States, with a pro Nazi stance. The organisation showed strong admiration for [[Adolf Hitler]] and the Nazi party. They carried out active propaganda for their cause, publishing magazines and brochures, along with the organisation of demonstrations and camps such as the Hitler Youth Camps. Members of the group attended the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin where leader [[Fritz Julius Kuhn]] was photographed with Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005684|title=German American Bund|website=www.ushmm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group attempted to 'awaken German Americans to Nazism'. They tried non-violent methods such as the infiltration of existing German ethnic clubs and the sponsorship of meetings and rallies. However, violence was inevitable when the Bund tried to take control through intimidating methods. In 1935 when the Wisconsin Federation of German-American societies voted to ban displays of the [[swastika]] at cultural events, members of the Bund threatened anti-Nazi delegates; one of many examples of their attempts to counteract 'Anti-German' movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americainwwii.com/articles/americans-for-hitler/|title=Americans for Hitler - the Bund - America in WWII magazine|website=www.americainwwii.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nazi Propaganda Ideas surrounding Anti-Americanism==
Themes in Nazi Propaganda aimed at America revolved largely around the idea that the United States faced a 'lack of unity.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/johann.htm|title=The Land Without Heart|first=Randall|last=Bytwerk|website=research.calvin.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; America was portrayed by the Nazi party as a regressed nation, one unable of appreciating European culture. Hitler declared America as a "mongrel nation", grown too rich too soon and governed by a capitalist elite with strong ties to the Jews and the Americans were a "mongrel people" incapable of higher culture or great creative achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus P. Fischer (2011). Hitler and America. University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; When giving a speech in reaction to America's negative comments on the Anti Jewish campaigns&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Randall Bytwerk (1998). "Goebbels on the United States (1939)". German Propaganda Archive, http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/goeb28.htm, retrieved 20 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1938, Goebbels mocked the country, commenting on the way they borrowed from other countries, their unemployment rates, lynchings in the country and the economic and political scandals the country had seen. He used these examples to ridicule America as a country and insinuated that America had no right to criticise any other country considering the state that their own was in. In the speech, Goebbels said that 'it is not surprising that the New York press attacks Germany so strongly. Over two million Jews live in New York and public, especially economic life, there is entirely under their control.'&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Goebbels went on to state, in a sarcastic nature: 'Such a nation is certainly justified in sneering at ancient Europe, whose nations and peoples looked back on centuries, even millennia, of cultural achievements long before America was even discovered.' This is an example of the theme discussed earlier about the Nazi party viewing America as a nation whose people did not have the ability to appreciate European culture. The Nazi propagandists blamed President Roosevelt for a lot of America's problems. They thought America was based on political and economic scandal. It was believed that America was too racially diverse and this was what allowed it to be controlled by Jews and Communists. Nazi propagandists also sometimes depicted President Roosevelt as a gangster, and later on in their Anti-American campaign lost all respect for him suggesting in one cartoon that he deserved to be executed.

==Roosevelt and Jewish links==
During the early years of Hitler being in office, he saw Jews as 'an element alien to the German nation' and he saw them as the main cause for all of Germany's problems.&lt;ref name="Herf2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Herf|title=The Jewish Enemy: Nazi Propaganda During World War II and the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3EZ50uDlSoC|date=1 July 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-674-03859-2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi caricatures often portrayed America to be under Jewish control as a result of Roosevelt's ruling. In several caricatures Roosevelt is depicted as a Jew, or to have Jewish ancestry. This is done through the use of classic anti-Semitic stereotypes such as a hooked nose, hunched back and the use of the [[Star of David]]. Caricatures of this nature tended to appear on the covers of Nazi magazines and newspapers, such as [[Kladderadatsch]]. One image appeared on this magazine with the caption 'President Roosevelt', showing him looking at his reflection in a mirror but seeing himself as a Jew. This supported the common Nazi propagandist theme that Roosevelt was under Jewish control. This was a popular topic for propaganda in the Nazi party and appeared in several other cartoons and caricatures on magazine covers. The theme can be seen in another cartoon on the cover of 'Lustige Blätter' which is captioned 'American candelabra. This again shows how the Nazi propagandists showed Roosevelt to be supportive of Jews.

==Roosevelt and Britain==
Another popular theme in Nazi propaganda against the United States was that of President Roosevelt exploiting Britain. One cartoon entitled 'This lion needs a haircut' shows Roosevelt cutting the hair of the British Lion. The pieces of hair he cuts off represent parts of the Empire such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad]]. This is used to show how America received British bases in return for the supplies they were giving England during the war. Another cartoon which depicts this theme is captioned "Take the bones to the kitchen. They'll make a good soup!" In this, Roosevelt has eaten the British lion, and is out to get everything he can out of the Empire, showing how the Nazis used America's alliance with Britain as propaganda against President Roosevelt. Both of these cartoons appeared in Lustige Blätter, a weekly German humor magazine. The magazine did not carry caricatures, even friendly ones, of Hitler or other Nazi leaders. There were many caricatures of Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bytwerk.com/gpa/lustige.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roosevelt and the Second World War==
The Nazi Party portrayed Roosevelt as seeing war as something which he could profit from. They used this as another anti American propaganda method. One cartoon on the cover of [[Kladderadatsch]] entitled "Roosevelt prays for peace" links this idea with the way the Nazi propagandists showed Roosevelt to be under the influence of the Jews. In this cartoon, Roosevelt is saying 'Grant, oh Jehovah, that war does not break out until we can sell weapons again!'. At the time of this cartoon, the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s]] were in place and this prevented the U.S from selling military equipment to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/franklin-roosevelt.htm|title=Nazi Caricatures of FDR|author=|date=|work=calvin.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazi party played on this suggesting that President Roosevelt did wanted war but only if he could profit from it. Another cartoon captioned 'They have their war! Warmonger #1 and his lure Eleanor'. The cartoon says 'Now the hobbling cripple and his ugly wife have what they wanted.' The first lady, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] is often criticised in Nazi caricatures and cartoon propaganda. The fact that the Nazi propagandists portray Roosevelt as wanting to go to war is also helpful to their propaganda campaign at home. The main task of Nazi propaganda, both at home and abroad was to reassure the general public, alarmed at the possibility that Hitler meant war.&lt;ref name="O'ConnorGriffiths2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brendon O'Connor|author2=Martin Griffiths|title=Anti-Americanism: Historical perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KF0pySH-ozsC|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-84645-025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt is the perfect opportunity to deflect the want for war onto a different source and therefore reassure the German people that Hitler was not the reason for war.

==Roosevelt as a gangster==
Roosevelt was often depicted in Nazi propaganda caricatures as a Gangster. One cartoon entitled 'Al Capone's best pupil' shows Roosevelt thanking Capone for his assistance and to let him know if there is anything he can do for him. Here, the Nazi's play on the theme that America was politically corrupt. This cartoon appeared in Lustige Blätter, a weekly magazine, discussed earlier in this article. Another cartoon shows Roosevelt in an electric chair and states that 'the gangster president' is in the president chair where he belongs. This image was featured on the cover of [[Kladderadatsch]].

==Other Nazi propaganda caricatures==
There are several other themes which don't necessarily fit into a particular category that were used by Nazi propagandists against America and Roosevelt. One shows a train named Roosevelt blowing out a lot of steam and making a lot of noise. It reads 'Well, Stalin, if noise were power the machine wouldn't be bad!' This was used to represent the regular Nazi theme that America were all talk and were big mouths that did not follow through on what they said. Another cartoon shows Roosevelt's failure in his [[New Deal]]. He is using his crutches to collect new military bases in Iceland and the Azores. This shows how Roosevelt is trying to find new ways to support himself after his previous plan had failed. Both of these images appeared on the cover of German weekly magazine [[Fliegende Blätter]]. The magazine reached a maximum circulation of around 95,000 copies by 1895 so reached a lot of Germans which was important for the Nazi party to send out their message.

==Plot==
Karim (Mahbub Alam) is a 27-year-old Bangladeshi working in an industrial laundry. An intellectual whose academic degree was not recognized in South Korea, Karim's work permit is about to expire and he's still owed a year's pay by a previous employer, Shin (Jung Dong-gyu), who's not taking his calls; meanwhile, his wife back home is giving him a hard time about money problems.

Seventeen-year-old high schooler Min-seo ([[Baek Jin-hee]]) is a social loner at odds with her mother, Eun-joo ([[Lee Il-hwa]]), who has a jobless, live-in lover, Ki-hong ([[Park Hyuk-kwon]]), whom she's planning to marry. Minseo's friends all take after-school classes at study institutes, but her single mother can't afford to pay for them. She eventually gets an under the table job at a massage parlor in order to pay for English classes.

On the first day of summer vacation, Min-seo is riding the bus when Karim drops his wallet. He exits the bus, and Min-seo takes the wallet for herself. However, Karim soon realizes what happens and manages to chase Min-seo down in a side street. "Let's go to the police station," he says in excellent Korean, but Min-seo tries to dissuade Karim from reporting her to the police by offering to grant him a favor, and reluctantly agrees to help track down his former boss. As the unlikely pair pose as loan sharks, they find themselves transforming each other's worlds in unexpected ways. They slowly form a mutual understanding, with the girl asking indiscreet questions and the gentleman preaching about problems in South Korean society. For Min-seo, Karim is initially a convenient badge she can wear in a society she sees herself at war with. But as she lowers her defenses, the relationship touchingly turns into a friendship between two lonely souls. But Karim's visa will not last forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elley|first=Derek|title=Bandhobi|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117941534/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=2012-12-04|date=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paquet|first=Darcy|title=Bandhobi|url=http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm09.html#bandhobi|work=Koreanfilm.org|accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Black''' is the darkest color, the result of the absence or complete [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of [[visible spectrum|visible]] [[light]]. It is an achromatic color, literally a color  without [[hue]], like [[white]] and [[gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/achromatic+color|title=Definition of ''achromatic''|publisher=Free Dictionary|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used [[symbol]]ically or [[figurative language|figuratively]] to represent darkness, while [[white]] represents light.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pages=105–26}}

Black [[ink]] is the most common color used for printing books, newspapers and documents, because it has the highest contrast with white paper and is the easiest to read. For the same reason, black text on a white screen  is the most common format used on computer screens.&lt;ref name="Heller, Eva 2009 p. 126"&gt;Heller, Eva, ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'' (2009), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[color printing]] it is [[CMYK shade model|used along with]] the [[subtractive shade|subtractive]] [[primary shade|primaries]] [[cyan]], [[yellow]], and [[magenta]], in order to help produce the darkest colors.

Black and white have often been used to describe opposites; particularly truth and ignorance, good and evil, the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] versus [[Age of Enlightenment]].   Since the [[Middle Ages]], black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority, and for this reason is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pages=105–26}}

Black was one of the first colors used by artists in [[neolithic]] cave paintings.  In the 14th century, it began to be worn by royalty, the clergy, judges and government officials in much of Europe. It became the color worn by English romantic poets, businessmen and statesmen in the 19th century, and a high fashion color in the 20th century.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pages=105–26}}

In the [[Roman Empire]], it became the color of mourning, and over the centuries it was frequently associated with [[death]], evil, witches and magic.  According to surveys in Europe and North America, it is the color most commonly associated with mourning, the end, secrets, magic, force, violence, evil, and elegance.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', pp.&amp;nbsp;105–27.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Etymology==
The word ''black'' comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''blæc'' ("black, dark", ''also'', "ink"), from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''blakkaz'' ("burned"), from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''bhleg-'' ("to burn, gleam, shine, flash"), from base *''bhel-'' ("to shine"), related to [[Old Saxon language|Old Saxon]] ''blak'' ("ink"), [[Old High German]] ''blach'' ("black"), [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''blakkr'' ("dark"), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''blaken'' ("to burn"), and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''bläck'' ("ink"). More distant cognates include [[Latin]] ''flagrare'' ("to blaze, glow, burn"), and [[Ancient Greek]] ''phlegein'' ("to burn, scorch").

The Ancient Greeks sometimes used the same word to name different colors, if they had the same intensity.  ''Kuanos''' could mean both dark blue and black.&lt;ref name="Michel Pastoureau pg. 34"&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Romans had two words for black:  ''ater'' was a flat, dull black, while ''niger'' was a brilliant, saturated black.  ''Ater'' has vanished from the vocabulary, but ''niger'' was the source of the country name ''Nigeria''&lt;ref&gt;"African nation, named for the river Niger, mentioned by that name 1520s (Leo Africanus), probably an alteration (by influence of Latin niger "black") of a local Tuareg name, egereou n-igereouen, from egereou "big river, sea" + n-igereouen, plural of that word. Translated in Arabic as nahr al-anhur "river of rivers." (Online Etymological Dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt;  the English word ''Negro'' and the word for "black" in most modern [[Romance languages]] ([[French language|French]]: ''noir''; [[Spanish language|Spanish and Portuguese]]: ''negro''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''nero'' ).

[[Old High German]] also had two words for black: ''swartz'' for dull black and ''blach'' for a luminous black.  These are parallelled in [[Middle English]] by the terms ''swart'' for dull black and ''blaek'' for luminous black. ''Swart'' still survives as the word ''swarthy'', while ''blaek'' became the modern English ''black''.&lt;ref name="Michel Pastoureau pg. 34"/&gt;

In heraldry, the word used for the black color is [[sable (heraldry)|sable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor-first=Stephen|editor-last=Friar|title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry|location=London|date=1987|publisher=[[A &amp; C Black|Alphabooks/A&amp;C Black]]|isbn=0-906670-44-6|pages=294, 343}}&lt;/ref&gt; named for the black fur of the [[sable]], an animal.

==History and art==

===Prehistoric history===
Black was one of the first colors used in art.  The [[Lascaux Cave]] in France contains drawings of bulls and other animals drawn by [[paleolithic]] artists between 18,000 and 17,000 years ago. They began by using charcoal, and then made more vivid black pigments by burning bones or grinding a powder of [[manganese oxide]].&lt;ref name="Michel Pastoureau pg. 34"/&gt;

===Ancient history===
For the ancient Egyptians, black had positive associations; being the color of fertility and the rich black soil flooded by the Nile. It was the color of [[Anubis]], the god of the underworld, who took the form of a black [[jackal]], and offered protection against evil to the dead.

For the ancient Greeks, black was also the color of the underworld, separated from the world of the living by the river [[Acheron]], whose water was black. Those who had committed the worst sins were sent to [[Tartarus]], the deepest and darkest level. In the center was the palace of [[Hades]], the king of the underworld, where he was seated upon a black [[ebony]] throne.

Black was one of the most important colors used by ancient Greek artists. In the 6th century BC, they began making [[black-figure pottery]] and later [[red figure pottery]], using a highly original technique. In black-figure pottery, the artist would paint figures with a glossy clay [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] on a red clay pot. When the pot was fired, the figures painted with the slip would turn black, against a red background. Later they reversed the process, painting the spaces between the figures with slip. This created magnificent red figures against a glossy black background.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the social hierarchy of [[ancient Rome]], purple was the color reserved for the Emperor; red was the color worn by soldiers (red cloaks for the officers, red tunics for the soldiers); white the color worn by the priests, and black was worn by craftsmen and artisans. The black they wore was not deep and rich; the vegetable dyes used to make black were not solid or lasting, so the blacks often turned out faded gray or brown.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In [[Latin]], the word for black, ''ater'' and to darken, ''atere'',  were associated with cruelty, brutality and evil. They were the root of the English words "atrocious" and "atrocity".&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'', New York: World Publishing Company (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

Black was also the Roman color of death and mourning. In the 2nd century BC Roman magistrates began to wear a dark toga, called a ''toga pulla'', to funeral ceremonies. Later, under the Empire, the family of the deceased also wore dark colors for a long period; then, after a banquet to mark the end of mourning, exchanged the black for a white toga. In Roman poetry, death was called the ''hora nigra'', the black hour.&lt;ref name="Michel Pastoureau pg. 34"/&gt;

The German and Scandinavian peoples worshipped their own goddess of the night, [[Nótt]], who crossed the sky in a chariot drawn by a black horse. They also feared [[Hel (being)|Hel]], the goddess of the kingdom of the dead, whose skin was black on one side and red on the other. They also held sacred the [[raven]]. They believed that [[Odin]], the king of the Nordic pantheon, had two black ravens, Huginn and Muninn, who served as his agents, traveling the world for him, watching and listening.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;34–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postclassical history===
In the early Middle Ages, black was commonly associated with darkness and evil. In Medieval paintings, the devil was usually depicted as having human form, but with wings and black skin or hair.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In the 12th and 13th centuries====
In fashion, black did not have the prestige of red, the color of the nobility. It was worn by [[Benedictine]] monks as a sign of humility and penitence. In the 12th century a famous theological dispute broke out between the [[Cistercian]] monks, who wore white, and the Benedictines, who wore black. A Benedictine abbot, Pierre the Venerable, accused the Cistercians of excessive pride in wearing white instead of black. Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], the founder of the Cistercians responded that black was the color of the devil, hell, "of death and sin," while white represented "purity, innocence and all the virtues".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black symbolized both power and secrecy in the medieval world. The emblem of the Holy Roman Empire of Germany was a black eagle. The [[black knight]] in the poetry of the Middle Ages was an enigmatic figure, hiding his identity, usually wrapped in secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;86–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black [[ink]], invented in China, was traditionally used in the Middle Ages for writing, for the simple reason that black was the darkest color and therefore provided the greatest contrast with white paper or parchment, making it the easiest color to read.  It became even more important in the 15th century, with the invention of [[printing]].    A new kind of ink, printer's ink, was created out of [[soot]], [[turpentine]] and [[walnut oil]]. The new ink made it possible to spread ideas to a mass audience through printed books, and to popularize art through black and white engravings and prints.  Because of its contrast and clarity, black ink on white paper continued to be the standard for printing books, newspapers and documents; and for the same reason black text on a white background is the most common format used on computer screens.&lt;ref name="Heller, Eva 2009 p. 126"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====In the 14th and 15th centuries====
In the early Middle Ages, princes, nobles and the wealthy usually wore bright colors, particularly [[scarlet (cloth)|scarlet]] cloaks from Italy. Black was rarely part of the wardrobe of a noble family. The one exception was the fur of the [[sable]]. This glossy black fur, from an animal of the [[marten]] family, was the finest and most expensive fur in Europe.  It was imported from Russia and Poland and used to trim the robes and gowns of royalty.

In the 14th century, the status of black began to change. First, high-quality black dyes began to arrive on the market, allowing garments of a deep, rich black. Magistrates and government officials began to wear black robes, as a sign of the importance and seriousness of their positions. A third reason was the passage of [[sumptuary laws]] in some parts of Europe which prohibited the wearing of costly clothes and certain colors by anyone except members of the nobility. The famous bright scarlet cloaks from [[Venice]] and the peacock blue fabrics from [[Florence]] were restricted to the nobility. The wealthy bankers and merchants of northern Italy responded by changing to black robes and gowns, made with the most expensive fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau,  Noir – HIstoire d'une couleur, pp.&amp;nbsp;93–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The change to the more austere but elegant black was quickly picked up by the kings and nobility. It began in northern Italy, where the Duke of Milan and the Count of Savoy and the rulers of Mantua, Ferrara, Rimini and Urbino began to dress in black. It then spread to France, led by [[Louis I, Duke of Orleans]], younger brother of King [[Charles VI of France]]. It moved to England at the end of the reign of King [[Richard II]] (1377–1399), where all the court began to wear black. In 1419–20, black became the color of the powerful Duke of Burgundy, [[Philip the Good]]. It moved to Spain, where it became the color of the Spanish Habsburgs, of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and of his son, [[Philip II of Spain]] (1527–1598). European rulers saw it as the color of power, dignity, humility and temperance. By the end of the 16th century, it was the color worn by almost all the monarchs of Europe and their courts.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;121–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Modern history===

====In the 16th and 17th centuries====
While black was the color worn by the Catholic rulers of Europe, it was also the emblematic color of the Protestant Reformation in Europe and the Puritans in England and America. [[John Calvin]], [[Philip Melanchthon]] and other Protestant theologians denounced the richly colored and decorated interiors of Roman Catholic churches. They saw the color red, worn by the Pope and his Cardinals, as the color of luxury, sin, and human folly.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;146–47.&lt;/ref&gt; In some northern European cities, mobs attacked churches and cathedrals, smashed the stained glass windows and defaced the statues and decoration. In Protestant doctrine, clothing was required to be sober, simple and discreet. Bright colors were banished and replaced by blacks, browns and grays; women and children were recommended to wear white.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;152–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Protestant Netherlands, [[Rembrandt]] used this sober new palette of blacks and browns to create portraits whose faces emerged from the shadows expressing the deepest human emotions. The Catholic painters of the Counter-Reformation, like [[Rubens]], went in the opposite direction; they filled their paintings with bright and rich colors. The new [[Baroque]] churches of the [[Counter-Reformation]] were usually shining white inside and filled with statues, frescoes, marble, gold and colorful paintings, to appeal to the public. But European Catholics of all classes, like Protestants, eventually adopted a sober wardrobe that was mostly black, brown and gray.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;150–51&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the second part of the 17th century, Europe and America experienced an epidemic of fear of [[witchcraft]].  People widely believed that the devil appeared at midnight in a ceremony called a [[Black Mass]] or black sabbath, usually in the form of a black animal, often a goat, a dog, a wolf, a bear, a deer or a rooster, accompanied by their [[familiar spirit]]s, black cats, serpents and other black creatures. This was the origin of the widespread superstition about black cats and other black animals. In medieval [[Flanders]], in a ceremony called ''Kattenstoet,'' black cats were thrown from the belfry of the Cloth Hall of [[Ypres]] to ward off witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Witch trials were common in both Europe and America during this period. During the notorious [[Salem witch trials]] in New England in 1692–93, one of those on trial was accused of being able turn into a "black thing with a blue cap,"  and others of having familiars in the form of a black dog, a black cat and a black bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/SALEM.HTM|title=The Salem Witchcraft Trials of 1692|first=Prof.|last=Linder|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteen women and men were hanged as witches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://salem.lib.virginia.edu/speccol/calef/calef.html |title=More Wonders Of The Invisible World |publisher=Salem.lib.virginia.edu |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====In the 18th and 19th centuries====
In the 18th century, during the European [[Age of Enlightenment]], black receded as a fashion color. Paris became the fashion capital, and pastels, blues, greens, yellow and white became the colors of the nobility and upper classes. But after the [[French Revolution]], black again became the dominant color.

Black was the color of the [[industrial revolution]], largely fueled by [[coal]], and later by oil. Thanks to coal [[smoke]], the buildings of the large cities of Europe and America gradually turned [[black carbon|black]].  By 1846 the industrial area of the West Midlands of England was "commonly called 'the [[Black Country]]'”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Upton|title=And so it came to pass...|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/lifestyle/came-pass-3920518|newspaper=Birmingham Post|publisher=Trinity Mirror Midlands|date=18 November 2011|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charles Dickens]] and other writers described the dark streets and smoky skies of London, and they were vividly illustrated in the engravings of French artist [[Gustave Doré]].

A different kind of black was an important part of the [[romantic movement]] in literature. Black was the color of [[Melancholia|melancholy]], the dominant theme of romanticism. The novels of the period were filled with castles, ruins, dungeons, storms, and meetings at midnight. The leading poets of the movement were usually portrayed dressed in black, usually with a white shirt and open collar, and a scarf carelessly over their shoulder, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and Lord Byron helped create the enduring stereotype of the romantic poet.

The invention of new, inexpensive synthetic black dyes and the industrialization of the textile industry meant that good-quality black clothes were available for the first time to the general population. In the 19th century gradually black became the most popular color of business dress of the upper and middle classes in England, the Continent, and America.

Black dominated literature and fashion in the 19th century, and played a large role in painting. [[James McNeil Whistler]] made the color the subject of his most famous painting, ''Arrangement in grey and black number one''  (1871), better known as ''[[Whistler's Mother]]''.

Some 19th-century French painters had a low opinion of black: "Reject black," [[Paul Gauguin]] said, "and that mix of black and white they call gray. Nothing is black, nothing is gray."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gauguin, ''Oviri.  Écrits d'un sauvage''. Textes choisis (1892–1903). Editions D. Guerin, Paris, 1974, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Édouard Manet]] used blacks for their strength and dramatic effect. Manet's portrait of painter [[Berthe Morisot]] was a study in black which perfectly captured her spirit of independence. The black gave the painting power and immediacy;  he even changed her eyes, which were green, to black to strengthen the effect.&lt;ref&gt;Steffano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Matisse]] quoted the French impressionist [[Pissarro]] telling him, "Manet is stronger than us all – he made light with black."&lt;ref&gt;Jack Flam, ''Matisse on Art'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] used luminous blacks, especially in his portraits. When someone told him that black was not a color, Renoir replied: "What makes you think that? Black is the queen of colors. I always detested Prussian blue. I tried to replace black with a mixture of red and blue, I tried using cobalt blue or ultramarine, but I always came back to ivory black."&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vincent van Gogh]] used black lines to outline many of the objects in his paintings, such as the bed in the famous painting of his bedroom. making them stand apart. His painting of black crows over a cornfield, painted shortly before he died, was particularly agitated and haunting.

In the late 19th century, black also became the color of [[anarchism]]. (See the section [[Black#Political movements|political movements]].)

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====In the 20th and 21st centuries====
In the 20th century, black was the color of Italian and German [[fascism]].  (See the section [[Black#Political movements|political movements]].)

In art, black regained some of the territory that it had lost during the 19th century. The Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], a member of the [[Suprematist]] movement, created the ''[[Black Square (painting)|Black Square]]'' in 1915, is widely considered the first purely abstract painting. He wrote, "The painted work is no longer simply the imitation of reality, but is this very reality&amp;nbsp;... It is not a demonstration of ability, but the materialization of an idea."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black was also appreciated by [[Henri Matisse]]. "When I didn't know what color to put down, I put down black," he said in 1945. "Black is a force: I used black as ballast to simplify the construction&amp;nbsp;... Since the impressionists it seems to have made continuous progress, taking a more and more important part in color orchestration, comparable to that of the double bass as a solo instrument."&lt;ref&gt;Jack Flam (1995), ''Matisse on Art'', p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, black came to be a symbol of individuality and intellectual and social rebellion, the color of those who didn't accept established norms and values. In Paris, it was worn by Left-Bank intellectuals and performers such as [[Juliette Greco]], and by some members of the [[Beat Movement]] in New York and San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Eva Heller pg 120"&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la Couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Black leather jackets were worn by motorcycle gangs such as the [[Hells Angels]] and street gangs on the fringes of society in the United States. Black as a color of rebellion was celebrated in such films as ''[[The Wild One]]'', with [[Marlon Brando]]. By the end of the 20th century, black was the emblematic color of the [[punk subculture]] [[punk fashion]], and the [[goth subculture]]. Goth fashion, which emerged in England in the 1980s, was inspired by [[Victorian era]] mourning dress.

In men's fashion, black gradually ceded its dominance to navy blue, particularly in business suits. Black evening dress and formal dress in general were worn less and less. In 1960, [[John F. Kennedy]] was the last American President to be inaugurated wearing formal dress; President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and all his successors were inaugurated wearing business suits.

Women's fashion was revolutionized and simplified in 1926 by the French designer [[Coco Chanel]], who published a drawing of a simple black dress in ''Vogue'' magazine. She famously said, "A woman needs just three things; a black dress, a black sweater, and, on her arm, a man she loves."&lt;ref name="Eva Heller pg 120"/&gt;  Other designers contributed to the trend of the [[little black dress]]. The Italian designer [[Gianni Versace]] said, "Black is the quintessence of simplicity and elegance," and French designer [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] said, "black is the liaison which connects art and fashion.&lt;ref name="Eva Heller pg 120"/&gt; One of the most famous black dresses of the century was designed by [[Hubert de Givenchy]] and was worn by [[Audrey Hepburn]] in the 1961 film ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''.

The American [[civil rights movement]] in the 1950s was a struggle for the political equality of [[African Americans]]. It developed into the [[Black Power]] movement in the late 1960s and 1970s, and popularized the slogan "[[Black is Beautiful]]".

In the 1990s, the [[Black Standard]] became the banner of several [[Islamic extremist]], [[jihadist]] groups. (See the section [[Black#Political movements|political movements]].)

===Physics===
{{Main article|Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)}}
In the [[visible spectrum]], black is the absorption of all colors.

Black can be defined as the visual impression experienced when no [[visible light]] reaches the eye. [[Pigment]]s or [[dye]]s that absorb light rather than reflect it back to the eye "look black". A black pigment can, however, result from a ''combination'' of several pigments that collectively absorb all colors. If appropriate proportions of three primary pigments are mixed, the result reflects so little light as to be called "black".

This provides two superficially opposite but actually complementary descriptions of black. Black is the absorption of all colors of light, or an exhaustive combination of multiple colors of pigment. See also [[primary colors]].

In [[physics]], a [[black body]] is a perfect absorber of light, but, by a thermodynamic rule, it is also the best emitter. Thus, the best radiative cooling, out of sunlight, is by using black paint, though it is important that it be black (a nearly perfect absorber) in the [[infrared]] as well.

In elementary science, far [[ultraviolet]] light is called "[[black light]]" because, while itself unseen, it causes many minerals and other substances to [[Phosphorescence|fluoresce]].

On January 16, 2008, researchers from [[Troy, New York]]'s [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] announced the creation of the then darkest material on the planet. The material, which reflected only 0.045 percent of light, was created from [[carbon nanotube]]s stood on end. This is 1/30 of the light reflected by the current standard for blackness, and one third the light reflected by the previous record holder for darkest substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/16/2139711.htm|title=Nanotubes yield the blackest black|date=January 16, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2016, the current darkest material known is claimed to be [[Vantablack]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 29 February 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last= Jones |first= Jonathan |title= Can an artist ever really own a colour? |url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2016/feb/29/anish-kapoor-vantablack-paint| date= 29 February 2016|newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=29 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 5 November 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last= Lee |first= Linda |title= Gazing Into the Void: What You Can Do With Vantablack, the Darkest Material Ever Made |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/garden/what-you-can-do-with-vantablack-the-darkest-material-ever-made.html?_r=0| date= 5 November 2014|newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |location=New York City| accessdate=29 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A material is said to be black if most incoming light is [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] equally in the material. Light ([[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[visible spectrum]]) [[Interaction#Physics|interacts]] with the [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s, which causes the energy of the light to be converted into other forms of energy, usually heat. This means that black surfaces can act as thermal collectors, absorbing light and generating heat (see [[Solar thermal collector]]).

Absorption of light is contrasted by [[Transmittance|transmission]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[Diffuse reflection|diffusion]], where the light is only redirected, causing objects to appear transparent, reflective or white respectively.

===Chemistry===

====Pigments====
The earliest pigments used by Neolithic man were [[charcoal]], [[red ocher]] and [[yellow ocher]]. The black lines of cave art were drawn with the tips of burnt torches made of a wood with [[resin]].&lt;ref name="Anne Varichon pg. 256"&gt;Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different charcoal pigments were made by burning different woods and animal products, each of which produced a different tone. The charcoal would be ground and then mixed with animal fat to make the pigment.
* '''Vine black''' was produced in Roman times by burning the cut branches of grapevines. It could also be produced by burning the remains of the crushed grapes, which were collected and dried in an oven. According to the historian [[Vitruvius]], the deepness and richness of the black produced corresponded to the quality of the wine. The finest wines produced a black with a bluish tinge the color of [[indigo]].

The 15th-century painter Cennino Cennini described how this pigment was made during the Renaissance in his famous handbook for artists: "...there is a black which is made from the tendrils of vines. And these tendrils need to be burned. And when they have been burned, throw some water onto them and put them out and then mull them in the same way as the other black. And this is a lean and black pigment and is one of the perfect pigments that we use."&lt;ref name="Lara Broecke 2015, p. 60"&gt;Lara Broecke, ''Cennino Cennini's ''Il Libro dell'Arte'': a New English Translation and Commentary with Italian Transcription'', Archetype 2015, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cennini also noted that "There is [[peach black|another black]] which is made from burnt almond shells or peaches and this is a perfect, fine black."&lt;ref name="Lara Broecke 2015, p. 60"/&gt; Similar fine blacks were made by burning the pits of the [[peach]], [[cherry]] or [[apricot]]. The powdered charcoal was then mixed with [[gum arabic]] or the yellow of an egg to make a paint.

Different civilizations burned different plants to produce their charcoal pigments. The [[Inuit]] of Alaska used wood charcoal mixed with the blood of [[Pinniped|seals]] to paint masks and wooden objects. The Polynesians burned [[coconut]]s to produce their pigment.
* [[Lamp black]] was used as a pigment for painting and frescoes. as a dye for fabrics, and in some societies for making tattoos.  The 15th century Florentine painter Cennino Cennini described how it was made during the Renaissance:  "... take a lamp full of linseed oil and fill the lamp with the oil and light the lamp. Then place it, lit, under a thoroughly clean pan and make sure that the flame from the lamp is two or three fingers from the bottom of the pan. The smoke that comes off the flame will hit the bottom of the pan and gather, becoming thick. Wait a bit. take the pan and brush this pigment (that is, this smoke) onto paper or into a pot with something. And it is not necessary to mull or grind it because it is a very fine pigment. Re-fill the lamp with the oil and put it under the pan like this several times and, in this way, make as much of it as is necessary."&lt;ref name="Lara Broecke 2015, p. 60"/&gt; This same pigment was used by Indian artists to paint the [[Ajanta Caves]], and as dye in ancient Japan.&lt;ref name="Anne Varichon pg. 256"/&gt;
* [[Ivory black]], also known as [[bone char]], was originally produced by burning ivory and mixing the resulting charcoal powder with oil. The color is still made today, but ordinary animal bones are substituted for ivory.
* [[Mars Black (pigment)|Mars black]] is a black pigment made of synthetic [[iron oxides]]. It is commonly used in water-colors and oil painting. It takes its name from [[Mars]], the god of war and patron of iron.

====Dyes====

Good-quality black [[dyes]] were not known until the middle of the 14th century. The most common early dyes were made from bark, roots or fruits of different trees;  usually the [[walnut]], [[chestnut]], or certain [[oak]] trees. The blacks produced were often more gray, brown or bluish. The cloth had to be dyed several times to darken the color. One solution used by dyers was add to the dye some iron filings, rich in iron oxide, which gave a deeper black. Another was to first dye the fabric dark blue, and then to dye it black.

A much richer and deeper black dye was eventually found made from the [[Oak apple]] or '''gall-nut'''.  The gall-nut is a small round tumor which grows on oak and other varieties of trees. They range in size from 2–5&amp;nbsp;cm, and are caused by chemicals injected by the [[larva]] of certain kinds of [[gall wasp]] in the family Cynipidae.&lt;ref name=cranshaw&gt;{{cite book|last=Cranshaw|first=Whitney|title=Garden Insects of North America|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0-691-09560-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dye was very expensive;  a great quantity of gall-nuts were needed for a very small amount of dye.  The gall-nuts which made the best dye came from [[Poland]], eastern Europe, the near east and North Africa.  Beginning in about the 14th century, dye from gall-nuts was used for clothes of the kings and princes of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau (2008), ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;112–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important source of natural black dyes from the 17th century onwards was the [[logwood tree]], or [[Haematoxylum campechianum]], which also produced reddish and bluish dyes. It is a species of [[Flowering plant|flowering]] [[tree]] in the [[legume]] family, [[Fabaceae]], that is native to southern [[Mexico]] and northern [[Central America]].&lt;ref name=GRIN&gt;{{GRIN | ''Haematoxylum campechianum'' | 18172 | accessdate = 2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern nation of [[Belize]] grew from 17th century [[Kingdom of England|English]] logwood logging camps.

Since the mid-19th century, synthetic black dyes have largely replaced natural dyes. One of the important synthetic blacks is [[Nigrosin]], a mixture of synthetic black dyes (CI 50415, Solvent black 5) made by heating a mixture of [[nitrobenzene]], [[aniline]] and aniline hydrochloride in the presence of a [[copper]] or [[iron]] [[catalyst]]. Its main industrial uses are as a colorant for lacquers and varnishes and in marker-pen inks.&lt;ref&gt;Green F. J. (1990), ''The Sigma-Aldrich Handbook of Dyes, Stains and Indicators'', pp.&amp;nbsp;513–15. Milwaukee:&amp;nbsp;Aldrich. {{ISBN|0-941633-22-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inks====

The first known inks were made by the Chinese, and date back to the 23rd century B.C. They used natural plant dyes and minerals such as [[graphite]] ground with water and applied with an [[ink brush]]. Early Chinese inks similar to the modern [[inkstick]] have been found dating to about 256 BC at the end of the [[Warring States period]]. They were produced from [[soot]], usually produced by burning pine wood, mixed with [[animal glue]]. To make ink from an inkstick, the stick is continuously ground against an [[inkstone]] with a small quantity of water to produce a dark liquid which is then applied with an [[ink brush]]. Artists and calligraphists could vary the thickness of the resulting ink by reducing or increasing the intensity and time of ink grinding. These inks produced the delicate shading and subtle or dramatic effects of [[Chinese brush painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=二、墨的發展史|first=玫芬|last=蔡|publisher=National Chang-Hua Hall of Social Education|url=http://www.chcsec.gov.tw/pcsec/research/four_treasure/books/ink/index_ink.htm|trans-title=Second, the ink history of the development|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041126130717/http://www.chcsec.gov.tw/pcsec/research/four_treasure/books/ink/index_ink.htm|archivedate=November 26, 2004|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[India ink]] (or '''Indian ink''' in [[British English]]) is a black [[ink]] once widely used for writing and printing and now more commonly used for [[drawing]], especially when inking [[comic book]]s and [[comic strip]]s. The technique of making it probably came from China. India ink has been in use in [[India]] since at least the 4th century BC, where it was called ''masi''. In India, the black color of the ink came from [[bone char]], [[tar]], [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] and other substances.&lt;ref&gt;"India ink." in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gottsege&gt;{{cite book

The Ancient Romans had a black writing ink they called ''[[atramentum]] librarium''.&lt;ref&gt;William Smith (editor) [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]], 1870
[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/index.html (text).]&lt;/ref&gt; Its name came from the Latin word ''atrare'', which meant to make something black. (This was the same root as the English word ''atrocious''.) It was usually made, like India ink, from [[soot]], although one variety, called ''atramentum elephantinum'', was made by burning the ivory of elephants.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Eastaugh, Valentine Walsh, Tracey Chaplin, Ruth Siddall, ''Pigment Compendium: A Dictionary of Historical Pigments'', Butterworth-Heinemann, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gall-nuts were also used for making fine black writing ink. [[Iron gall ink]] (also known as iron gall nut ink or oak gall ink) was a purple-black or brown-black [[ink]] made from [[iron]] salts and [[tannic acid]]s from gall nut. It was the standard writing and drawing [[ink]] in [[Europe]], from about the 12th century to the 19th century, and remained in use well into the 20th century.

===Astronomy===
* A [[black hole]] is a region of [[spacetime]] where gravity prevents anything, including [[light]], from escaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wald|1984|pp=299–300}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of [[general relativity]] predicts that a sufficiently compact [[mass]] will deform spacetime to form a black hole. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an [[event horizon]] that marks the point of no return. It is called "black" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect [[black body]] in [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, [[supermassive black hole]]s of millions of solar masses may form. There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Although a black hole itself is black, infalling material forms an [[accretion disk]], which is one of brightest types of object in the universe.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Why the night sky and space are black – Olbers' paradox====
The fact that [[outer space]] is black is sometimes called [[Olbers' paradox]]. In theory, because the universe is full of stars, and is believed to be infinitely large, it would be expected that the light of an infinite number of stars would be enough to brilliantly light the whole universe all the time. However, the background color of outer space is black. This contradiction was first noted in 1823 by German astronomer [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers]], who posed the question of why the night sky was black.

The current accepted answer is that, although the universe is infinitely large, it is not infinitely old. It is thought to be about 13.8 billion years old, so we can only see objects as far away as the distance light can travel in 13.8 billion years. Light from stars farther away has not reached Earth, and cannot contribute to making the sky bright. Furthermore, as the universe is expanding, many stars are moving away from Earth. As they move, the wavelength of their light becomes longer, through the [[Doppler effect]], and shifts toward red, or even becomes invisible. As a result of these two phenomena, there is not enough starlight to make space anything but black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question52.html|title=Why is space black?|website=starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The daytime sky on Earth is blue because light from the Sun strikes molecules in Earth's atmosphere scattering light in all directions. Blue light is scattered more than other colors, and reaches the eye in greater quantities, making the daytime sky appear blue. This is known as [[Rayleigh scattering]].

The nighttime sky on Earth is black because the part of Earth experiencing night is facing away from the Sun, the light of the Sun is blocked by Earth itself, and there is no other bright nighttime source of light in the vicinity. Thus, there is not enough light to undergo Rayleigh scattering and make the sky blue. On the Moon, on the other hand, because there is no atmosphere to scatter the light, the sky is black both day and night. This phenomenon also holds true for other locations without an atmosphere.

==Culture==
In China, the color black is associated with water, one of the five fundamental elements believed to compose all things;  and with winter, cold, and the direction north, usually symbolized by a black tortoise.  It is also associated with disorder, including the positive disorder which leads to change and new life. When the first Emperor of China [[Qin Shi Huang]] seized power from the [[Zhou Dynasty]], he changed the Imperial color from red to black, saying that black extinguished red.  Only when the [[Han Dynasty]] appeared in 206 BC was red restored as the imperial color.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', pp.&amp;nbsp;223–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese and Japanese character for black (''kuro'' in Japanese), can, depending upon the context, also mean dark or evil.

In Japan, black is associated with mystery, the night, the unknown, the supernatural, the invisible and death.  Combined with white, it can symbolize intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/j/japanese-art-and-design-colour/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322054855/http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/j/japanese-art-and-design-colour/ |archivedate=March 22, 2013 |df=mdy }} Exhibit at the Victoria and Albert Museum on color in Japanese art and design,&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan in the 10th and 11th century, it was believed that wearing black could bring misfortune.  It was worn at court by those who wanted to set themselves apart from the established powers or who had renounced material possessions.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan black can also symbolize experience, as opposed to white, which symbolizes naiveté. The black belt in martial arts symbolizes experience, while a white belt is worn by novices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/blacks.html |website=Webexhibits.org |series=Pigments through the ages |title=Intro to the blacks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese men traditionally wear a black kimono with some white decoration on their wedding day.

In Indonesia black is associated with depth, the subterranean world, demons, disaster, and the left hand.  When black is combined with white, however, it symbolizes harmony and equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon, pp.&amp;nbsp;224–25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political movements===
'''Anarchism''' is a political philosophy, most popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which holds that governments and capitalism are harmful and undesirable. The [[Anarchist symbolism|symbols of anarchism]] was usually either a black flag or a black letter A. More recently it is usually represented with a bisected red and black flag, to emphasise the movement's socialist roots in the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]]. Anarchism was most popular in Spain, France, Italy, Ukraine and Argentina. There were also small but influential movements in the United States and Russia. In the latter, the movement initially allied itself with the Bolsheviks.&lt;ref name="blackflame"&gt;Michael Schmidt and [[Lucien van der Walt]], ''[[Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism (Counter-Power vol. 1)|Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism]]''. (Oakland and Edinburgh: [[AK Press]], 2009), pp. 33–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Black Army''' was a collection of anarchist military units which fought in the [[Russian Civil War]],  sometimes on the side of the Bolshevik [[Red Army]], and sometimes for the opposing [[White Army]]. It was officially known as the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]], and it was under the command of the famous anarchist [[Nestor Makhno]].

'''Fascism'''. The [[Blackshirts]] ({{lang-it|camicie nere, 'CCNN}}) were [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] [[paramilitary]] groups in [[History of Italy as a monarchy and in the World Wars|Italy]] during the period immediately following [[World War I]] and until the end of [[World War II]]. The Blackshirts were officially known as the Voluntary Militia for National Security (''Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale'', or MVSN).

Inspired by the black uniforms of the [[Arditi]], Italy's elite storm troops of World War I, the Fascist Blackshirts were organized by [[Benito Mussolini]] as the military tool of his political movement.&lt;ref name="Bosworth"&gt;Bosworth, R. J. B, ''Mussolini's Italy: Life Under the Fascist Dictatorship, 1915–1945'', Penguin Books, 2005, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; They used violence and intimidation against Mussolini's opponents. The emblem of the Italian fascists was a black flag with [[fasces]], an axe in a bundle of sticks, an ancient Roman symbol of authority. Mussolini came to power in 1922 through his [[March on Rome]] with the blackshirts.

Black was also adopted by [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] in Germany. Red, white and black were the colors of the flag of the German Empire from 1870 to 1918. In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler explained that they were "revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past." Hitler also wrote that "the new flag&amp;nbsp;... should prove effective as a large poster" because "in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement." The black [[swastika]] was meant to symbolize the [[Aryan]] race, which, according to the Nazis, "was always anti-Semitic and will always be anti-Semitic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/pimpfhitler.htm |title=Nazi propaganda pamphlet "The Life of the Führer" |publisher=Calvin.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several designs by a number of different authors were considered, but the one adopted in the end was Hitler's personal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Mein Kampf]], volume 2, chapter VII |last=Hitler |first=Adolf |authorlink=Adolf Hitler |year=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black became the color of the uniform of the [[SS]], the ''Schutzstaffel'' or "defense corps", the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, and was worn by SS officers from 1932 until the end of World War II.

The Nazis used a [[black triangle (badge)|black triangle]] to symbolize anti-social elements. The symbol originates from [[Nazi concentration camp]]s, where every prisoner had to wear one of the [[Nazi concentration camp badges]] on their jacket, the color of which categorized them according to "their kind." Many Black Triangle prisoners were either mentally disabled or mentally ill. The homeless were also included, as were alcoholics, the [[Romani people]], the habitually "work-shy," prostitutes, draft dodgers and pacifists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chgs.umn.edu/histories/documentary/hadamar/asocials.html The unsettled, "asocials", alcoholics and prostitutes]. Center for Holocaust &amp; Genocide Studies. [[University of Minnesota]]. Retrieved September 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the black triangle has been adopted as a symbol in [[lesbian culture]] and by disabled activists.

Black shirts were also worn by the [[British Union of Fascists]] before World War II, and members of fascist movements in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la Couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patriotic Resistance'''. The [[Lützow Free Corps]], composed of volunteer German students and academics fighting against [[Napoleon]] in 1813, could not afford to make special uniforms and therefore adopted black, as the only color that could be used to dye their civilian clothing without the original color showing.  In 1815 the students began to carry a red, black and gold flag, which they believed (incorrectly) had been the colors of the Holy Roman Empire (the imperial flag had actually been gold and black). In 1848, this banner became the flag of the [[German confederation]]. In 1866, [[Prussia]] unified Germany under its rule, and imposed the red, white and black of its own flag, which remained the colors of the German flag until the end of the Second World War. In 1949 the Federal Republic of Germany returned to the original flag and colors of the students and professors of 1815, which is the flag of Germany today.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000) ''Psychologie de la Couleur – effets et symboliques'', pp.&amp;nbsp;124–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islamism'''. The [[Black Standard]] ({{lang|ar|راية السوداء |rtl=yes}} {{lang|ar-Latn|rāyat al-sawdā' }}, also known as {{lang|ar| راية العقاب |rtl=yes}} {{lang|ar-Latn|rāyat al-'uqāb}} "[[:wikt:راية|banner]] of the [[:wikt:عقاب#Arabic|eagle]]" or simply as {{lang|ar|[[:wikt:الراية|الراية]]|rtl=yes}} {{lang|ar-Latn|al-rāya}} "the banner") is the historical flag flown by [[Muhammad]] in [[hadith|Islamic tradition]], an [[eschatology|eschatological]] symbol in [[Shi'a Islam]] (heralding the advent of the [[Mahdi]]),&lt;ref name="cookshia"&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Muslim Apocalyptic|author=David Cook |year=2002|publisher=Darwin Press|page=197}} from Majlisi.&lt;/ref&gt; and a symbol used in [[Islamism]] and [[Jihadism]].

Black has been a traditional color of cavalry and armoured or mechanized troops. German armoured troops ([[Panzerwaffe]]) traditionally wore black uniforms, and even in others, a [[black beret]] is common. In Finland, black is the symbolic color for both armoured troops and combat engineers, and military units of these specialities have black flags and unit insignia.

The [[black beret]] and the color black is also a symbol of special forces in many countries. Soviet and Russian [[OMON]] special police and [[Naval Infantry (Russia)|Russian naval infantry]] wear a black beret. A black beret is also worn by military police in the Canadian, Czech, Croatian, Portuguese, Spanish and Serbian armies.

The silver-on-black skull and crossbones symbol or [[Totenkopf]] and a black uniform were used by [[Hussar]]s and [[Black Brunswickers]], the German [[Panzerwaffe]] and the Nazi [[Schutzstaffel]], and U.S. [[400th Missile Squadron]] (crossed missiles), and continues in use with the Estonian [[Kuperjanov Battalion]].

===Religion===

* In [[Christian]] theology, black was the color of the universe before [[God]] created light. In many religious cultures, from [[Mesoamerica]] to [[Oceania]] to [[India]] and [[Japan]], the world was created out of a primordial darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuppi, ''Color in Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;268–69.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bible]] the light of faith and Christianity is often contrasted with the darkness of ignorance and paganism.

In Christianity, the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]] is often called the "prince of darkness." The term was used in [[John Milton]]'s poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', published in 1667, referring to [[Satan]], who is viewed as the embodiment of evil. It is an English translation of the Latin phrase ''princeps tenebrarum'', which occurs in the ''[[Acts of Pilate]]'', written in the fourth century, in the 11th-century [[hymn]] ''Rhythmus de die mortis'' by [[Pietro Damiani]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uan.it/alim/letteratura.nsf/(testiID)/9941C91390B5688BC125709F002D7C68!opendocument |title=Petrus Damiani: Opera poetica Pag 89 |publisher=Uan.it |date=2005-10-19 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a sermon by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.binetti.ru/bernardus/86_1.shtml |title="Sermones in Cantica canticorum, I–XVII" – Bernardus Claraevallensis |publisher=Binetti.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the 12th century. The phrase also occurs in ''[[King Lear]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] (c. 1606), Act III, Scene IV, l. 14:
'The prince of darkness is a gentleman."

Priests and pastors of the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Protestant]] churches commonly wear black, as do [[monks]] of the [[Benedictine Order]], who consider it the color of humility and penitence.
* In [[Islam]], black, along with green, plays an important symbolic role. It is the color of the [[Black Standard]], the banner that is said to have been carried by the soldiers of [[Muhammad]]. It is also used as a symbol in [[Shi'a Islam]] (heralding the advent of the [[Mahdi]]), and the flag of followers of [[Islamism]] and [[Jihadism]].
* In [[Hinduism]], the goddess [[Kali]], goddess of time and change, is portrayed with black or dark blue skin. wearing a necklace adorned with severed heads and hands. Her name means "The black one". She destroys anger and passion according to Hindu mythology and her devotees are supposed to abstain from meat or intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goddess Kali never accepts nonvegetarian food because she is the chaste wife of Lord Siva|url=http://vaniquotes.org/wiki/Goddess_Kali_never_accepts_nonvegetarian_food_because_she_is_the_chaste_wife_of_Lord_Siva|publisher=Vani Quotes|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kali FAQ|url=http://www.shreemaa.org/questions-answers-goddess-kali/|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Kali does not eat meat, but it is the śāstra's injunction that those who are unable to give up meat-eating, they may sacrifice one goat, not cow, one small animal before the goddess Kali, on amāvāsya (new moon) day, night, not day, and they can eat it.

===Sports===
* The national [[rugby union]] team of New Zealand is called the ''[[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]]'', in reference to their black outfits, and the color is also shared by other New Zealand national teams such as the [[Black Caps]] (cricket) and the [[Kiwis]] (rugby league).

==Associations and symbolism==

===Mourning===
In Europe and America, black is the color most commonly associated with [[mourning]] and bereavement.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 109. In the survey cited, 80 percent of respondents said black was the color of mourning.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the color traditionally worn at funerals and memorial services. In some traditional societies, for example in Greece and Italy, some widows wear black for the rest of their lives. In contrast, across much of Africa and parts of Asia like Vietnam, white is a color of mourning and is worn during funerals.

In Victorian England, the colors and fabrics of mourning were specified in an unofficial [[mourning dress|dress code]]:  "non-reflective black paramatta and crape for the first year of deepest mourning, followed by nine months of dullish black silk, heavily trimmed with crape, and then three months when crape was discarded.  Paramatta was a fabric of combined silk and wool or cotton; crape was a harsh black silk fabric with a crimped appearance produced by heat.  Widows were allowed to change into the colors of half-mourning, such as gray and lavender, black and white, for the final six months."&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Jalland, Death in the Victorian Family, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

A "black day" (or week or month) usually refers to tragic date. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] marked ''[[fasti]]'' days with white stones and ''nefasti'' days with black. The term is often used to remember massacres. Black months include the [[Black September in Jordan]], when large numbers of Palestinians were killed, and [[Black July]] in [[Sri Lanka]], the killing of members of the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] population by the [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] government.

In the financial world, the term often refers to a dramatic drop in the stock market. For example, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[stock market crash]] on October 29, 1929, which marked the start of the [[Great Depression]], is nicknamed Black Tuesday, and was preceded by Black Thursday, a downturn on October 24 the previous week.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Darkness and evil===
In western popular culture, black has long been associated with [[evil]] and [[darkness]]. It is the traditional color of [[witchcraft]] and [[black magic]].

In the [[Book of Revelation]], the last book in the [[New Testament]] of the Bible, the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] are supposed to announce the [[Apocalypse]] before the [[Last Judgment]]. The horseman representing famine rides a black horse.

The [[vampire]] of literature and films, such as [[Count Dracula]] of the [[Bram Stoker]] novel,  dressed in black, and could only move at night. The [[Wicked Witch of the West]] in the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' became the archetype of witches for generations of children.  Whereas witches and sorcerers inspired real fear in the 17th century, in the 21st century children and adults dressed as witches for Halloween parties and parades.

===Power, authority, and solemnity===
Black is frequently used as a color of power, law and authority. In many countries judges and magistrates wear black robes. That custom began in Europe in the 13th and 14th centuries. Jurists, magistrates and certain other court officials in France began to wear long black robes during the reign of [[Philip IV of France]] (1285–1314), and in England from the time of [[Edward I]] (1271–1307). The custom spread to the cities of Italy at about the same time, between 1300 and 1320. The robes of judges resembled those worn by the clergy, and represented the law and authority of the King, while those of the clergy represented the law of God and authority of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;114–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 20th century most police uniforms were black, until they were largely replaced by a less menacing blue in France, the U.S. and other countries. In the United States, police cars are frequently [[black and white (police vehicle)|Black and white]]. The [[riot control]] units of the [[Basque Autonomous Police]] in Spain are known as ''[[beltzak]]'' ("blacks") after their uniform.

Black today is the most common color for limousines and the official cars of government officials.

Black evening dress is still worn at many solemn occasions or ceremonies, from graduations to formal balls.  Graduation gowns are copied from the gowns worn by university professors in the Middle Ages, which in turn were copied from the robes worn by judges and priests, who often taught at the early universities. The [[mortarboard]] hat worn by graduates is adapted from a square cap called a [[biretta]] worn by Medieval professors and clerics

===Functionality===
In the 19th and 20th centuries, many machines and devices, large and small, were painted black, to stress their functionality. These included telephones, sewing machines, steamships, railroad locomotives, and automobiles. The [[Ford Model T]], the first mass-produced car, was available only in black from 1914 to 1926. Of means of transportation, only airplanes were rarely ever painted black.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black house paint is becoming more popular with [[Sherwin-Williams]] reporting that the color, Tricorn Black, was the 6th most popular exterior house paint color in Canada and the 12th most popular paint in the United States in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fenton |first=Laura |url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/8/1/17631794/modern-black-houses-exterior-colors |title=Black is the new black |work=[[Curbed]] |date=2018-08-01 |accessdate=2018-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnography===
{{further information|Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|Classification of ethnicity in the United Kingdom|Demographics of Canada|Demographics of Australia|Race and ethnicity in Brazil}}
* The term "black" is often used in the West to describe people whose skin is darker. In the United States, it is particularly used to describe [[African Americans]]. The terms for African Americans have changed over the years, as shown by the categories in the [[United States Census]], taken every ten years.
* In the first U.S. Census, taken in 1790, just four categories were used: Free White males, Free White females, other free persons, and slaves.
* In the 1820 census the new category "colored" was added.
* In the 1850 census, slaves were listed by owner, and a B indicated black, while an M indicated "[[mulatto]]."
* In the 1890 census, the categories for race were white, black, mulatto, [[quadroon]] (a person one-quarter black); [[octoroon]] (a person one-eighth black), Chinese, Japanese, or American Indian.
* In the 1930 census, anyone with any black blood was supposed to be listed as "[[Negro]]."
* In the 1970 census, the category "Negro or black" was used for the first time.
* In the 2000 and 2012 census, the category "Black or African-American" was used, defined as "a person having their origin in any of the racial groups in Africa." In the 2012 Census 12.1 percent of Americans identified themselves as Black or African-American.&lt;ref name=thru&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/index_of_questions|title=Through the Decades | accessdate=2012-01-18 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black is also commonly used as a racial description in the [[United Kingdom]], since ethnicity was first measured in the 2001 census.  The 2011 British census asked residents to describe themselves, and categories offered included Black, African, Caribbean, or Black British.  Other possible categories were African British, African Scottish, Caribbean British and Caribbean Scottish. Of the total UK population in 2001, 1.0 percent identified themselves as Black Caribbean, 0.8 percent as Black African, and 0.2 percent as Black (others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/Classifications/ns_ethnic_classification.asp |title=The Classification of Ethnic Groups |publisher=National Statistics |date=2001-02-16 |accessdate=2007-04-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406195623/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/Classifications/ns_ethnic_classification.asp |archivedate=April 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], census respondents can identify themselves as Black. In the 2006 census, 2.5 percent of the population identified themselves as black.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/rt-td/eth-eng.cfm] 2006 Canadian census, ethnicity&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], the term black is not used in the census.  In the 2006 census, 2.3 percent of Australians identified themselves as [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] and/or [[Torres Strait]] Islanders.

In [[Brazil]], the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) asks people to identify themselves as ''branco'' (white), ''pardo'' (brown), ''preto'' (black), or ''amarelo'' (yellow). In 2008 6.8 percent of the population identified themselves as "preto".&lt;ref&gt;IBGE. 2008 PNAD.

===Black and white===
* Black and white have often been used to describe opposites; particularly light and darkness and good and evil. In [[Medieval literature]], the [[knight (stock character)|white knight]] usually represented virtue, the [[black knight]] something mysterious and sinister. In American [[westerns]], the hero often wore a white hat, the villain a black hat.
* In the original game of [[chess]] invented in [[Persia]] or [[India]], the colors of the two sides were varied; a 12th-century Iranian chess set in the [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]], has red and green pieces. But when the game was imported into Europe, the colors, corresponding to European culture, usually became black and white.
* Studies have shown that something printed in black letters on white has more authority with readers than any other color of printing.
* In philosophy and arguments, the issue is often described as [[black-and-white]], meaning that the issue at hand is [[dichotomy|dichotomized]] (having two clear, opposing sides with no middle ground).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Black chambers and black ops===
Black is commonly associated with [[secrecy]].
* The [[Black Chamber]] was a term given to an office which secretly opened and read diplomatic mail and broke codes. Queen [[Elizabeth I]] had such an office, headed by her Secretary, Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], which successfully broke the Spanish codes and broke up several plots against the Queen. In France a ''cabinet noir'' was established inside the French post office by [[Louis XIII]] to open diplomatic mail. It was closed during the [[French Revolution]] but re-opened under [[Napoleon I]]. The [[Habsburg Empire]] and [[Dutch Republic]] had similar black chambers.
* The United States created a secret peacetime [[Black Chamber]], called the Cipher Bureau, in 1919. It was funded by the [[State Department]] and Army and disguised as a commercial company in New York. It successfully broke a number of diplomatic codes, including the code of the Japanese government. It was closed down in 1929 after the State Department withdrew funding, when the new Secretary of State, [[Henry Stimson]], stated that "Gentlemen do not read each other's mail." The Cipher Bureau was the ancestor of the U.S. [[National Security Agency]].&lt;ref name=NSAtimeline&gt;{{cite web|title=Pre-1952 Historical Timeline|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/center_crypt_history/pre_1952_timeline/index.shtml|work=National Security Agency|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A ''black project'' is a secret military project, such as [[Enigma machine|Enigma Decryption]] during World War II, or a secret counter-narcotics or police [[sting operation]].
* [[Black ops]] are covert operations carried out by a government, government agency or military.
* A [[Black Budget]] is a government budget that is allocated for classified or other secret operations of a nation. The black budget is an account expenses and spending related to military research and covert operations. The black budget is mostly classified due to security reasons.

===Elegance – black and fashion===
Black is the color most commonly associated with elegance in Europe and the United States, followed by silver, gold, and white.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black first became a fashionable color for men in Europe in the 17th century, in the courts of Italy and Spain. (See history above.) In the 19th century, it was the fashion for men both in business and for evening wear, in the form of a black coat whose tails came down the knees. In the evening it was the custom of the men to leave the women after dinner to go to a special smoking room to enjoy cigars or cigarettes. This meant that their tailcoats eventually smelled of tobacco. According to the legend, in 1865 [[Edward VII]], then the Prince of Wales, had his tailor make a special short [[smoking jacket]].  The smoking jacket then evolved into the dinner jacket. Again according to legend, the first Americans to wear the jacket were members of the Tuxedo Club in New York State. Thereafter the jacket became known as a [[tuxedo]] in the U.S. The term "smoking" is still used today in Russia and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;
Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;
The tuxedo was always black until the 1930s, when the [[Duke of Windsor]] began to wear a tuxedo that was a very dark midnight blue. He did so because a black tuxedo looked greenish in artificial light, while a dark blue tuxedo looked blacker than black itself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

For women's fashion, the defining moment was the invention of the [[little black dress|simple black dress]] by [[Coco Chanel]] in 1926. (See history.) Thereafter, a long black gown was used for formal occasions, while the simple black dress could be used for everything else. The designer [[Karl Lagerfeld]], explaining why black was so popular, said:  "Black is the color that goes with everything. If you're wearing black, you're on sure ground."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Skirts have gone up and down and fashions have changed, but the black dress has not lost its position as the essential element of a woman's wardrobe. The fashion designer [[Christian Dior]] said, "elegance is a combination of distinction, naturalness, care and simplicity,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and black exemplified elegance.

The expression  "X is the new black" is a reference to the latest trend or fad that is considered a wardrobe basic for the duration of the trend, on the basis that black is always fashionable. The phrase has taken on a life of its own and has become a [[cliché]].

Many performers of both popular and [[European classical music]], including French singers [[Edith Piaf]] and [[Juliette Greco]], and violinist [[Joshua Bell]] have traditionally worn black on stage during performances. A black costume was usually chosen as part of their image or stage persona, or because it did not distract from the music, or sometimes for a political reason. Country-western singer [[Johnny Cash]] always wore black on stage. In 1971, Cash wrote the song "[[Man in Black (song)|Man in Black]]" to explain why he dressed in that color: "We're doing mighty fine I do suppose / In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes / But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back / Up front there ought to be a man in black."

'''Buridan's Bridge''' (also known as '''[[Sophism]] 17''') is described by [[Jean Buridan]], one of the most famous and influential [[Philosophy|philosophers]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]], in his book ''Sophismata''. It is a [[self-referential]] [[paradox]] that involves a [[proposition]] pronounced about an event that might or might not happen in the future.

==The sophism==

The sophism is:
{{quotation|Imagine the following scenario:&lt;br&gt;
Socrates wants to cross a river and comes to a bridge guarded by Plato. The two speak as follows:&lt;br&gt;
''Plato:'' "Socrates, if in the first proposition which you utter, you speak the
truth, I will permit you to cross. But surely, if you speak falsely, I shall throw you into the water."&lt;br&gt;
''Socrates:'' "You will throw me into the water."&lt;ref name="Tense"/&gt;}}

[[Socrates]]' response puts [[Plato]] in a difficult situation. He could not throw Socrates into the water, because if he did he would violate his promise to let Socrates cross the bridge if he speaks the truth. On the other hand, if Plato allows Socrates to cross the bridge it would mean that Socrates spoke untruth when he replied: "You are going to throw me into the water." In that case Socrates should have been thrown into the water. In other words, Socrates could be allowed to cross the bridge if and only if he could not be.&lt;ref name="Buridan's Bridge"/&gt;

==Buridan's solution==

In order to solve the paradox Buridan proposes three questions:
#Is the proposition uttered by Socrates: "You are going to throw me into the water" true, or is it false?
#Is Plato's promise true or is it false?
#"What ought Plato to do to fulfill his promise?"&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In response to the first question Buridan states that it is impossible to determine if Socrates' proposition is true or false. This is because the proposition "You are going to throw me into the water" is a [[Problem of future contingents|future contingent]] that could be true or false depending on what Plato is going to do. Dr. Joseph W. Ulatowski says that Buridan apparently used [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] thesis about what "truth" is to come up with this response. Aristotle believed that a proposition is true if and only if it is verified by the state of things as they currently are. Contradicting the [[principle of bivalence]], Buridan implies a system of  [[three-valued logic]] in which there are three [[truth value]]s--''true'', ''false'', and some indeterminate third value.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In determining the truth value of Plato's conditional promise, Buridan suggests that Plato's promise was false, and that because Plato gave his promise carelessly he is not obligated to fulfill the promise.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In discussing the third question, "What ought Plato to do to fulfill his promise", Buridan states that Plato should not have given a conditional promise in the first place. He also suggests that Plato could have made sure that the condition was formulated in such a way that it would not cause a contradiction; because Plato cannot fulfill his conditional promise without violating it, he is not obligated to fulfill the promise. Ulatowski points out that this interpretation is the [[contrapositive]] of a principle of [[Immanuel Kant]]: "ought implies can".&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

==Philosophers on the sophism and its solution==

In his solution to the sophism, [[Walter Burley]] (d. 1344/1345) applied the principle "nothing is true unless at this instant" (''"nihil est verum nisi in hoc instanti"'') and concluded that "if a proposition is true it must be true now".&lt;ref name="truth now"/&gt;

Dr. Dale Jacquette of the [[University of Bern]] says that "Plato can either permit Socrates to pass or have him seized and thrown into the river without violating his conditional vow". Jacquette argues that Plato's conditional promise was given only in regard to Socrates's proposition being clearly and unconditionally either true or false. To prove his point Jacquette asks, what would Plato have to do if Socrates had said nothing and was "as silent as a [[Sphinx]]", or if he uttered something that could not be either proven or "undisproven", something like [[Goldbach's conjecture]]. Jacquette concludes that Plato's conditional promise was true, and Socrates's proposition is "neither true ''simpliciter'' nor false ''simpliciter''", and therefore Plato would be right regardless of the choice that he made.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In his book ''Paradoxes from A to Z'' Professor Michael Clark comes to the conclusion that if Plato is an honorable man, Socrates should not get wet under any circumstances. Clark argues that Socrates could say, "Either I am speaking falsely, and you will throw me in, or I am speaking truly, and you won't throw me in". Clark says that if this sentence is true, then it means that the first alternative "is ruled out", leaving us only with the second one. If this sentence is false, it means that both alternatives are false, and because Socrates spoke falsely "it will be false" to throw him into the river.&lt;ref name="Paradoxes from A to Z"/&gt;  

Dr. Joseph W. Ulatowski believes that since the truth value in Plato's conditional promise and even more so in Socrates's proposition is indeterminate, it means that Plato "ought to err on the side of caution with respect to the future contingency and allow Socrates to cross the bridge".&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt; In the same work Ulatowski offers a couple of humorous solutions to the paradox. Plato, Ulatowski says, could let Socrates to cross the bridge, and then throw him into water on the other side. Or both Plato and Socrates could combine their efforts and forcibly eject Buridan himself from Buridan's bridge.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

==In ''Don Quixote''==

Buridan's bridge sophism was used by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] in ''[[Don Quixote]]'',&lt;ref name="Paradoxes from A to Z"/&gt; when [[Sancho Panza|Sancho]] was presented with the Buridan's bridge dilemma: A man who was going to cross the bridge was asked to respond truthfully where he was going or otherwise to face a death by hanging. The man "swore and said that by the oath he took he was going to die upon that gallows that stood there, and nothing else."&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt;

Sancho summarizes the situation by saying: "the man swears that he is going to die upon the gallows; but if he dies upon it, he has sworn the truth, and by the law enacted deserves to go free and pass over the bridge; but if they don't hang him, then he has sworn falsely, and by the same law deserves to be hanged". He then comes up with the solution, "that of this man they should let pass the part that has sworn truly, and hang the part that has lied; and in this way the conditions of the passage will be fully complied with".&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt; After Sancho makes this statement, the person who was asking for advice reasons with him:{{quotation|"But then, senor governor," replied the querist, "the man will have to be divided into two parts; and if he is divided of course he will die; and so none of the requirements of the law will be carried out, and it is absolutely necessary to comply with it."&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt;}} Sancho comes up with the moral solution:{{quotation|...there is the same reason for this passenger dying as for his living and passing over the bridge; for if the truth saves him the falsehood equally condemns him; and that being the case it is my opinion you should say to the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the arguments for condemning him and for absolving him are exactly balanced, they should let him pass freely, as it is always more praiseworthy to do good than to do evil.&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt;}}

'''Canadian Deaf Theatre''' is Canada's only anglophone deaf professional theatre company.&lt;ref name="Carbin"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clifton F. Carbin|author2=Dorothy L. Smith|title=Deaf heritage in Canada: a distinctive, diverse, and enduring culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uMGxAAAACAAJ|accessdate=21 March 2011|date=2 May 1996|publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson|isbn=978-0-07-551378-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its philosophy is "A belief in the interest and inherent natural ability of deaf people to act and entertain on a serious professional level and to offer something different from that of the hearing/speaking theatrical medium".

CDT was founded in 1989 by Lewis Hartland (born June 16, 1955), a former member of the Canadian Theatre of the Deaf.  It is based in [[Cranbrook, British Columbia]]. Opening night for ''Varieties'', the company's first production, was January 10, 1990. The first performances starred Hartland and hearing actress, Toni Miller, a native of [[Prince George, British Columbia]], who was later replaced by Hartland's deaf wife, Constance Alice (née Harrison).

==Performance==

Presented in [[Mime artist|mime]], sign mime, [[pantomime]], visual vernacular, theatrical clown, [[American Sign Language]], ASL poetry and mime with masks, CDT's performances are designed to delight both deaf and hearing audiences. The company also offers workshops for children and adults on such topics as visual theatre techniques, storytelling, [[creative drama]], the dynamics of communication and mime. The workshops for deaf children are designed to "enhance the student's power of perception, encourage their talents and skills in expressing themselves creatively, and increase their appreciation of the theatre."&lt;ref name="Carbin"/&gt;

==History==

Founder and [[artistic director]], Hartland was born in [[Nelson, British Columbia]] and became deaf at the age of eight months from [[spinal meningitis]]. While a student at the Jericho Hill Provincial School for the Deaf in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. (1960–1972), he also took special instruction from a professional mime professor at [[Simon Fraser University]] in [[Burnaby, British Columbia]] (1970). He trained at the Canadian Mime Theatre School in 1977, took an actor's lab with Polish actor Ryszard Cieslak (1977), and presented solo mime performances as Lewis the Mime in [[Canada]] and the U.S. from 1977-1989. He was one of the founding members of the Canadian Theatre of the Deaf and performed with that company in 1976 and 1977. In 1977 Hartland founded the Deaf Mime Company of Toronto, and in 1982, he established the Ontario Theatre of the Deaf; both companies later disbanded. In 1988 and 1989, he studied and performed in the [[United States]] with the [[National Theatre of the Deaf]] in Chester, Connecticut. Enabled by the awarding of grants by the [[Canada Council for the Arts]], Hartland also attended advanced studies with NTD. In the summer of 1989, he was one of the invited performers at The Deaf Way Conference and Festival in [[Washington, D.C.]] While there, he was approached by a representative of the Canadian Cultural Society of the Deaf, who encouraged him to form what became the Canadian Deaf Theatre. CDT was then founded in 1989 with the subsequent establishing of a Board of Directors in [[Cranbrook, British Columbia]] in 1990. CDT received significant provincial and federal grants as well as private donations.

Connie Hartland (b. March 23, 1955) is a consummate performer in her own right. She was born hard of hearing in [[Burnaby, British Columbia]] as a result of maternal [[rubella]] (she is now profoundly deaf), and attended several schools including Jericho Hill Provincial School (1960–1965), the Herbert Symonds Public School in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] (1965–1966), the Ontario School for the Deaf, Milton (1966–1971 and 1973–1974), and the Ontario School for the Deaf in Belleville (1971–1973). Prior to joining her husband on stage, she travelled through [[Alaska]] presenting workshops in mime, and appeared on television in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] with her puppets.

At the beginning of each show, the couple's hearing son Samson Hartland (b May 5, 1979), serves as interpreter while his father introduces the concept behind Canadian Deaf Theatre and explains something about their innovative and entertaining techniques.&lt;ref name="Carbin"/&gt;

==Present==

In the summer of 1992, the Hartlands moved to [[Whitehorse, Yukon]] Territory, where they owned and operated a store called Last Frontier Sports Cards and Comics. Hartland hopes to move the CDT from Cranbrook, B.C. to Whitehorse one day and establish it in the [[Yukon]] with a new board of directors. He coaches acting on the side, and both he and his wife are active in the local Whitehorse Deaf community, advocating for such things as [[Telecommunications device for the deaf|TDD]] access and special long distance rates (50 percent discount) for deaf telephone users in the [[Yukon]] and [[Northwest Territories]] (a struggle in which they were assisted by federal [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] leader [[Audrey McLaughlin]] (Member of Parliament for Yukon Territory) and were successful in achieving). In 2003, they were also successful in lobbying the City of [[Whitehorse, Yukon]] to provide [[closed captioning]] of its publicly broadcast [[City Council]] meetings, making it the first municipality in [[Canada]] to offer such service.

A '''cell phone novel''', or {{nihongo|'''mobile phone novel'''|携帯小説|keitai shousetsu|{{zh|t=手機小說|p=shŏujī xiǎoshuō}}|lead=yes}}, is a [[literary]] work originally written on a [[cellular phone]] via [[text messaging]]. This type of [[literature]] originated in Japan, where it has become a popular [[literary genre]]. However, its popularity has also spread to other [[countries]] internationally, especially to [[China]], [[United States]], [[Germany]], and [[South Africa]]. Chapters usually consist of about 70-100 words each due to character limitations on cell phones.&lt;ref name="Asahi News"&gt;[http://book.asahi.com/clip/TKY200702100253.html book.asahi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Phone novels started out primarily read and authored by young women on the subject of romantic fiction such as [[intimate relationships|relationships]], [[sexual partners|lovers]], [[rape]], [[love triangle]]s, and [[pregnancy]]. However, mobile phone novels are gaining worldwide popularity on broader subjects. Rather than appearing in printed form, the literature is typically sent directly to the reader via email, SMS text message, or subscription through an online writing and sharing website, chapter by chapter. Japanese Internet [[ethos]] regarding mobile phone novels is dominated by pen names and forged identities.  Therefore, identities of the Japanese authors of mobile phone novels are rarely disclosed.

Japanese cell phone novels were also downloaded in short installments and run on handsets as [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based mobile applications in three different formats: WMLD, JAVA and TXT. Maho i-Land is the largest Japanese cell phone novel site that carries more than a million titles, mainly novice writers, all which are available for free. Maho iLand provides templates for blogs and homepages.  It is visited 3.5 billion times each month{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.  In 2007, 98 cell phone novels were published into books.  "[[Koizora]]" is a popular phone novel with approximately 12 million views on-line, written by "Mika", that was not only published but turned into a movie.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/12/22/i-%E2%99%A5-novels newyorker.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
Five out of the ten best selling novels in Japan in 2007 were originally cell phone novels.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/world/asia/20japan.html?pagewanted=all New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The first cell phone novel was “published” in [[Japan]] in 2003 by a Tokyo man in his mid-thirties who calls himself Yoshi. His first cell phone novel was called ''[[Deep Love: The Story of Ayu|Deep Love]]'', the story of a teenager engaged in "subsidized dating" ([[Enjo kosai|enjō kosai]]) in [[Tokyo]] and contracting [[AIDS]]. It became so popular that it was published as an actual book, with 2.6 million copies sold in Japan, then spun off into a [[television series]], a [[manga]], and a [[movie]]. The cell phone novel became a hit mainly through word of mouth and gradually started to gain traction in [[Taiwan]], [[China]], and [[South Korea]] among young adults.  In Japan, several sites offer large prizes to authors (up to $100,000 US) and purchase the publishing rights to the novels.

The movement also became popular in [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and [[North America]]. In Europe it started in about 2007, promoted by people like Oliver Bendel and [[Wolfgang Hohlbein]], and publishers such as Cosmoblonde or Blackbetty Mobilmedia. Teenagers in South Africa have been downloading an m-novel called ''Kontax'' - a novel specifically written for mobile phones.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8329537.stm | work=BBC News | title=Mobile novels switch on S Africa | date=2009-10-28 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pioneer cell phone novel in North America, a novel called ''Secondhand Memories'' by Takatsu - that can be viewed on Textnovel,&lt;ref name="Secondhand Memories"&gt;[http://www.textnovel.com textnovel.com]&lt;/ref&gt; the first English language cell phone novel site founded in the United States - has been viewed more than 60,000 times and published in print in 2015 as a paperback.

== Reason for popularity ==

Although Japan was the original birthplace of the cell phone novel, the phenomenon soon moved to other parts of [[East Asia]], and many of the online writers are university students. These writers understand what narratives will attract young readers, incorporating emergent events or trendy elements from teen culture into their stories.

Cell phone novels create a [[virtual world]] for teenagers via the mobile phone, or, more precisely, via [[text messages]]. As in virtual online [[video game]]s, readers can put themselves into first person in the story. Cell phone novels create a personal space for each individual reader. As Paul Levinson wrote in ''Cellphone'', "nowadays, a writer can write just about as easily, anywhere, as a reader can read" (p 20).

The [[cell phone]] novel is changing reading habits; readers no longer need to physically go to a bookshop and purchase a book. They can go online using their cell phone, download a novel, and read it on their personal mobile phone anywhere, any time they wish. Similar to the [[e-book]], its mobility and convenience saves time.

== Characteristics and literary style ==
Because of the short chapter format consisting of around 70-100 words (usually fewer than 200), the phenomenon has brought a new approach to literature, allowing a new vision to potentially redefine traditional writing and the publishing world. Despite the use of cell phones, most of these novels are not written with SMS slang and language. Instead, it has brought out a new era of minimalism and art. In each chapter, readers will be able to experience narration, poetry and even visual arts in the use of carefully chosen line breaks, punctuation, rhythm and white space.

Often, cell phone novels features the use of fragments, conversational, simple and delicate language; cliffhangers and dramatic dialogue emphasized by the unseen or omitted becomes a vital part of the reading experience, allowing deeper meanings and interpretations to unfold. Because of the use of poetic language, mood, emotions and internal thoughts are stimulated in the reader easily. Dramatic and drastic plots takes readers through twists and turns, cliffhanger after cliffhanger, always keeping the reader waiting for the next chapter instalment.

The nature of writing and reading on the go, creates a unique experience, allowing the writer and reader to approach literature in a different way, opening interactivity between the readers and the writer as the story develops in "real time".

'''''Celtic Tiger Live''''' or more often known '''''Michael Flatley's Celtic Tiger''''' or just '''''Celtic Tiger''''' was an [[Irish dance]] show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/article-2991839/Michael-Flatley-s-taking-final-bow.html Daily Mail]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
[[Michael Flatley]], known for [[Riverdance]], [[Lord of the Dance (musical)|Lord of the Dance]] and [[Feet of Flames]], created ''Celtic Tiger'' which debuted in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelflatley.com/about/ Biography of Michael Flatley from his website]&lt;/ref&gt; After being retired for four years{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, Flatley  announced he was going to tour with a new show. In the summer of 2004 Flatley started the rehearsals of a new show in the SFX Theatre in [[Dublin]], Ireland{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. In the autumn of 2004 the rehearsals moved on in the Shepperton Studios in London{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. Michael tried his best to keep the details including the name of the show a secret{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. Michael announced on his website in April 2005 that he was going to have a preview show of his new show Celtic Tiger in June 2005{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}.

''Celtic Tiger'' had its first performance at a private, invitation-only performance at the NIA Birmingham, England on 17 June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celticcafe.com/celticcafe/Dance/MichaelFlatley/CelticTiger/01_TigerOnTour.html Celtic Cafe]&lt;/ref&gt;  The show was first performed for the public on 9 July 2005 in the [[Stadium Puskás Ferenc|Puskás Stadion]] (formerly the Népstadion) in [[Budapest]], Hungary. Another preview show was planned for [[Prague]] in the [[Czech Republic]], but at the last minute that show was cancelled due to the venue (which included a massive stage specially built for the show) was unsafe for the dancers.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The next show, a preview show for the US tour, was held in Worcester, Massachusetts, on 24 September 2005, followed by a gala performance in New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]] on 27 September 2005, the show's official US premiere. The show then toured through Canada and sections of the US, with the final 2005 performance at the Patriot Center in Fairfax, Virginia on 26 November 2005.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

''Celtic Tiger'' started its European World Tour on 20 April 2006 at the Point Theatre in Dublin. That show was the first time Flatley had danced in the [[Point Theatre]] since he debuted ''Lord of the Dance''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} On 15 November 2006, the Autumn and Winter tours for the ''Celtic Tiger'' tour of Europe and Asia were cancelled when Flatley was hospitalised for a viral infection for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/seriously-ill-flatley-forced-to-cancel-celtic-tiger-tour-26355644.html Irish Independent]&lt;/ref&gt; Flatley claimed in his website that he would release future touring dates in early 2007 but never did{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}.

==Meaning==
In the press release announcing the European preview of the show, Michael Flatley explained '''Celtic Tiger'' portrays the oppression of a people and the tiger symbolises the awakening of their Spirit and their struggle for freedom. ''Celtic Tiger'' is my finest work to date. Budapest is one of my favourite cities in the world and I can think of no greater place to preview my new show." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celticcafe.com/archive/Shows/Celtic_Tiger/old/index.htm Celtic Cafe]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''charrette''' (American pronunciation: {{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɑː|ˈ|ɹ|ɛ|t|}}), often Anglicized to '''charette''' or '''charet''' and sometimes called a '''design charrette''', is an intense period of [[design]] or [[planning]] activity.

==Origins of the term "charrette"==
The word ''charrette'' is [[French language|French]] for "[[cart]]" or "[[chariot]]." Its use in the sense of design and planning arose in the 19th century at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]], where it was not unusual at the end of a term for teams of student architects to work right up until a deadline, when a charrette would be wheeled among them to collect up their scale models and other work for review. Their continued working furiously to apply the finishing touches came to be referred to as working ''en charrette'', "in the cart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonda|first=Penny|title=Sustainable Commercial Interiors|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smbC2VdZE5MC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Zola]] depicted such a scene of feverish activity, a ''nuit de charrette'' or "charrette night," in ''[[L'Œuvre]]'' (serialized 1885, published 1886), his fictionalized account of his friendship with [[Paul Cézanne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gendrat|first=Aurélie|title=Émile Zola, L'Œuvre|year=1999|publisher=Bréal|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5bLDsrgErkC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term evolved into the current design-related usage in conjunction with working right up until a deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The NCI Charrette System|url=http://www.charretteinstitute.org/charrette.html|publisher=Charrette Institute|accessdate=February 12, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126100645/http://www.charretteinstitute.org/charrette.html|archivedate=November 26, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--In the 16th, 17th, and 18th century when travel took long periods, a ''charrette'' referred to long carriage rides{{cn}}, in which politicians and policy makers would be sequestered together in order to collaborate in solving a set problem over the duration of their journey. This origin is most similar to the current usage of the word in the design world.--&gt;

==Charrettes in general==

The word ''charrette'' may refer to any collaborative session in which a group of [[designers]] drafts a solution to a design problem.

While the structure of a charrette varies, depending on the design problem and the individuals in the group, charrettes often take place in multiple sessions in which the group divides into sub-groups.  Each sub-group then presents its work to the full group as material for further [[dialogue]]. Such charrettes serve as a way of quickly generating a design solution while integrating the aptitudes and interests of a diverse group of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govanpartick.com/what.html|title=Govan Partick Charrette|website=www.govanpartick.com|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the structure of charrettes may vary, the general idea of a charrette is to create an innovative atmosphere in which a diverse group of stakeholders can collaborate to "generate visions for the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-7031-7_2|title=The Design Charrette|last=Roggema|first=Rob|date=2014|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789400770300|editor-last=Roggema|editor-first=Rob|pages=15–34|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-7031-7_2#page-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare this term with [[workshop]].

==Specific cases of charrette==
Charrettes take place in many disciplines, including [[land use planning]], or [[urban planning]].  In planning, the charrette has become a technique for consulting with all [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]].  This type of charrette (sometimes called an enquiry by design) typically involves intense and possibly multi-day meetings, involving [[municipal]] officials, [[real estate developer|developer]]s, and residents.  A successful charrette promotes joint ownership of solutions and attempts to defuse typical confrontational attitudes between residents and developers.  Charrettes tend to involve small groups, however the residents participating  may not represent all the residents nor have the [[moral authority]] to represent them.  Residents who do participate get early input into the planning process.   For developers and municipal officials charrettes achieve community involvement, may satisfy [[Public consultation|consultation]] criteria, with the objective of avoiding costly legal battles.  Other uses of the term "charrette" occur within an academic or [[profession]]al setting, whereas urban planners invite the general public to their planning charrettes.  Thus most people (unless they happen to be design students) encounter the term "charrette" in an urban-planning context.

In fields of [[design]] such as [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[interior design]], [[interaction design]], or [[graphic design]], the term ''charrette'' may refer to an intense period of work by one person or a group of people prior to a deadline. The period of a charrette typically involves both focused and sustained effort. The word "charrette" may also be used as a verb, as in, for example, "I am charretting" or "I am on charrette [or: en charrette]," simply meaning I am working long nights, intensively toward a deadline.

An example of a charrette occurred in Florida in 1973 when the future residents of the [[Miccosukee Land Co-op]] in Tallahassee traveled by auto caravan to Orlando and spent the weekend at the offices of the King Helie Planning Group of Orlando (sleeping on the floor) working with its staff to develop the community's land use plans; features desired by individual members and acceptable to the group included a perfectly circular lot, a huge treehouse lot, and streets named after Beatles songs (such as "The Long and Winding Road". "Penny Lane", "Abbey Road"). A more recent example, from [[New College of Florida]], is their Master Plan Design Charrettes that took place over a week in 2005 involving students, alumni, administrators, professors, area residents, and local government staff members as well as architects, designers, and planners from Moule &amp; Polyzoides, The Folsom Group, the Florida House Institute for Sustainable Development, Hall Planning &amp; Engineering, and Biohabitats in a process to make long-range suggestions for the campus layout, landscaping, architecture, and transportation corridors of the master plan for its campus.

In some cases, a charrette may be held on a recurring basis, such as the annual charrette held by the Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning department at Utah State University. Each February, the faculty choose a site in partnership with communities and groups throughout Utah, and hold an intense 5-day design charrette focusing on particular issues in that community or region. The charrette begins with a field visit, followed by all-day work sessions accompanied by project stakeholders and volunteer landscape architects and other professionals, and overseen by senior and graduate level students. The final work is then presented to the community. Charrettes such as these offer students and professionals the opportunity to work together in a close setting on real-world design scenarios, and often provide communities with tens of thousands of dollars of design work for free.

The Schools of Architecture at [[Rice University]] and at the [[University of Virginia]] call the last week before the end of classes ''Charrette''.&lt;ref name="Kemmer2008"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Suzanne Kemmer |title=Charrette: Neologisms |url=https://neologisms.rice.edu/index.php?a=term&amp;d=1&amp;t=11504 |website=neologisms.rice.edu |publisher=Rice University |accessdate=16 September 2018 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20180916151329/https://neologisms.rice.edu/index.php?a=term&amp;d=1&amp;t=11504 |archivedate=September 16, 2018 |location=Houston, Texas |language=en |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maital2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shlomo Maital|title=Innovate Your Innovation Process: 100 Proven Tools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-exDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103|year=2016|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4759-95-3|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the final deadline time (assigned by the school), all students must put their "pencils down" and stop working. Students then present their work to fellow students and faculty in a [[critique]]d presentation.

Many municipalities around the world develop long-term city plans or visions through multiple charrettes - both communal and professional.  Notable successes on the west coast of Canada include the city of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}, as well as the District of Tofino. Tofino won an Award of Excellence in Planning after a successful multi-day charrette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityspaces.ca/project/tofino-downtown-vitalization-plan/|title=Award-Winning Tofino Downtown Vitalization Plan -|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''church of Jesus Christ the Redeemer''' ( ''chiesa Gesù Cristo Redentore'') is a  [[Church (building)|Catholic church in]] [[Alcamo]], in the [[province of Trapani]].

== Foundation ==
On June 14, 1985, the bishop of the [[diocese of Trapani]], Mons. Emanuele Romano, established a new [[Parish]] dedicated to Gesù Cristo Redentore; it was entrusted to Don Benedetto Cottone (the parson of this Church for 23 consecutive years) starting his experience in small premises located in Via Kennedy, which remained the place of communion for 19 years.

After two years in another place located in Via Tre Santi, they succeeded  in completing  a hospitable, large and beautiful church. It has been the centre of the parish life of Sant’Anna district, for 10 years up to now and on April 4, 2015, on the 30th anniversary of the foundation, they have organized a very great feast with sport, cultural and religious events, including the procession which was authorized by the [[Bishop of Trapani]] Mons. Pietro Maria Fragnelli. In 2016 they wanted to repeat this experience, thanks to the parishioners who collaborated with the present parson, Don Franco Finazzo, for the success of the different events.

== Description ==
[[File:Gesù_Cristo_Redentore_-_Alcamo_(interni).jpg|thumb|The interior of the church]]
In the [[planning]] of the overall parish “Gesù Cristo Redentore”,  they have followed  the [[guidelines]] recommended by the  [[Italian Episcopal Conference|Conferenza Episcopale Italiana]] ([[Italian Episcopal Conference]]) in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;divisare.com, http://divisare.com/projects/15141-vincenzo-calvaruso-progetto-chiesa-gesu-cristo-redentore-di-alcamo .&lt;/ref&gt;

The church, in a central position in the district of “Sant’Anna” (in the area of Via Kennedy) is an example of how the use of [[glued laminated timber]] allows to link functionality and beauty; it is larger than 600 square metres and,  in accordance with the regulations on the removing of architectural barriers, it has a sloping floor towards the [[Presbytery (architecture)]], with a [[declivity]] which allows an optimal participation to the believers during the liturgical functions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archilovers.com/projects/95719/chiesa-parrocchiale-gesu-cristo-redentore.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is made up of the Presbytery, located in the [[apse]], with a step higher than the [[hall]], the Ambon and the sacramental area, with a wooden [[dome]] (in glued laminated timber) above it;  the floor here is realized with [[polychrome]] marbles and so believers can differentiate the meaning of the different  liturgical functions;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archilovers.com/projects/95719/chiesa-parrocchiale-gesu-cristo-redentore.html&lt;/ref&gt; a central [[nave]], corresponding with the hall, and with about 600 seats, and two [[aisle]]s  for the coming in and out of people, and for the processional route during the functions; the [[parvis]] which permits the outdoor  celebrations with a great participation of believers, thanks to its position on the top of the staircases.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archilovers.com/projects/95719/chiesa-parrocchiale-gesu-cristo-redentore.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Initially the plan also included the building of the [[bell tower]], with a small dome surmounted by a [[cross]], with seven [[bronze]] bells.

The premises for the parish activities include a large hall, in accordance with the regulations on the removing of architectural barriers, which is a little sloping, letting people have a better visual participation, and nine rooms for  the [[catechism]] lessons. The [[arcade (architecture)]], three metres large and around the main structure, is like a  covered [[walkway]] for people coming out of the hall and the other rooms on the ground floor, from the parvis towards the [[rectory]] and the [[sacristy]] on the eastern side, and towards the public car-park on the western side.

Finally the open spaces include a car-park, on the south-west side with the access from via Kennedy, a basketball field, and some arranged green areas, where there are plants characteristic of the [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean flora]].
== Works ==
There are three very beautiful sculptures made by [[Massimiliano Apicella]] from [[Turin]]:

[[Image:Colab logo.jpg|right|thumb|250px]]
'''Colab''' is the commonly used abbreviation of the [[New York City]] artists' group '''Collaborative Projects''', which was formed after a series of open meetings between artists of various disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;David Little, ''Colab Takes a Piece, History Takes It Back: Collectivity and New York Alternative Spaces'', ''Art Journal'' Vol.66, No. 1, Spring 2007, College Art Association, New York, pp. 60-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Colab came together as a collective in 1977,  first using the name Green Corporation, and initially received an NEA Workshop Grant through Center for New Art Activities, Inc., a small not-for-profit formed in 1974.

In 1978, Collaborative Projects was incorporated as a not-for-profit and later received its tax-exempt status from the IRS, so that it could apply for grants from the NEA and other sources independently.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julie Ault]]. ''Alternative Art, New York, 1965-1985'' [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2002: p.217&lt;/ref&gt; Colab was active for about 10 years and became distinguished by the raw energy of its members and sometimes politically engaged open membership. By raising its own sources of funding, Colab was in control of its own exhibitions and cable TV shows.&lt;ref&gt;Max Schumann (ed.) ''A Book about Colab (and Related Activities)'' [[Printed Matter, Inc]], 2016: pp.9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocating a form of cultural activism that was purely artist driven, the group created artworks, negotiated venues, curated shows, crafted their own PR, and engaged in discourse that responded to the political themes and predicaments of their time, among them the recessions of the 1970s, the Reagan era of budget cuts and nuclear armament, the housing crisis and gentrification in New York City, and other pressing social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Max Schumann (ed.) ''A Book about Colab (and Related Activities)'' Printed Matter, Inc, 2016: pp.9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
From November 1978, different artist members organized and installed original one-off group shows in their own studios or other temporary sites, such as  "The Batman Show," (591 Broadway 1979), "Income and Wealth Show" (5 Bleecker Store 1979), "Doctors &amp; Dentists Show" (591 Broadway 1979), ''The Manifesto Show'' (5 Bleecker Store 1979), "The Dog Show" (591 Broadway 1979), "Just Another Asshole Show" (5 Bleecker Store), ''[[The Real Estate Show]]'' ([[Delancey Street]], Jan. 1980), Jay St film shows 1979, ''Exhibit A'' (93 Grand Street, 1979) and, notably, ''The Times Square Show'' (201 W 41st, June 1980), a large open exhibition near the center of New York's entertainment (and pornography) district ([[Times Square]]) put on with Bronx-based [[Fashion Moda]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Schumann (ed.) ''A Book about Colab (and Related Activities)'' [[Printed Matter, Inc]], 2016: pp.120-135&lt;/ref&gt;
Seed money from the first Colab (Green Corp.) workshop grant through Center for New Art Inc. led to the creation of Colab artists' TV series on Manhattan Cable (1978–1984) "All Color News,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/XFR_2013_10_15_1A_23 Colab 78-80 (1978-80)]: Anybody's Show; End of the World; July 4, 1980; Real Estate Show; Shipwreck; Dance of the Leper; All Color News (Colab)&lt;/ref&gt; "Potato Wolf" and "Red Curtain", [[New Cinema]], a screening room on St. Mark's Place for narrative Super 8 films transferred to video and projected on an Advent screen; the continued publication of X Motion Picture Magazine(1979), whose first issue preceded the formation of Colab;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Masters, (2007) ''[[No Wave]]'', Black Dog Publishing, London, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; support and inspiration for the [[ABC No Rio|ABC No Rio cultural center]] (1980-82 (ongoing) created from the Real Estate Show;  support of the [[Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine]] (1984), NightShift Theater 1979, Spanner Magazine (3 issues 1979), MWF Video Club (established in 1986) and [[Bomb (magazine)|Bomb Magazine]] (1981).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo McCormick]], ''The Downtown Book: The New York Art Scene, 1974–1984'', [[Princeton University]] Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the original group are presently highly active making art, and the membership has shifted and evolved. ABC No Rio was recently awarded a $1.6 million capital construction grant from the City of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/nyregion/04abc.html|title=For $1, a Collective Mixing Art and Radical Politics Turns Itself Into Its Own Landlord|date=July 4, 2006|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:1984Colab.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Colab at [[ABC No Rio]] circa 1984 photo by Peter Sumner Walton Bellamy]] --&gt;
"We [Collaborative Projects] are functioning as a group of artists with complementary resources and skills providing a solid ground for [[collaborative]] work directed to the needs of the community-at-large. Specifically we are involved in programs facilitating development, production, and distribution of collaborative works. These works are realized in various [[Media (arts)|media]] including [[film]] and [[video]] for distribution and cable-cast, and live cable TV broadcasts, as well as other more conventional art media such as graphics and printed materials."&lt;ref&gt;''The Red Book'', 1978 (NEA application document authored by Coleen Fitzgibbon, Andrea Callard and Ulli Rimkus) Andrea Callard Papers, ''The Downtown Collection'', Fales Library, [[NYU]]&lt;/ref&gt;

"This statement (the one above) defines three fundamental aspects of Colab - members' desire to create and distribute "collaborative work" under the umbrella of an artist-run organization, their focus on new media versus traditional art objects and their openness to a range of aesthetic styles that would meet the "needs of the community-at-large." This last point was critical to the group's identity and served as the foundation of a workshop-oriented administration that encouraged experimentation in many different areas, including but not limited to TV production, video editing, film, and [[performance art]]. With various workshops operating simultaneously and the participants' ability to draw on like-minded members as partners, Colab could produce many projects without the burden of an institutional identity. Typically, individual members worked together on more than one project in small subgroups that changed and over lapped from one project to the next."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomotterness.net/pdf/news_artjournal_colabdavidlittle_2007.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011001/http://www.tomotterness.net/pdf/news_artjournal_colabdavidlittle_2007.pdf |date=2007-09-28 }} David Little, Artjounal pdf file&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, artists emulating 1970s Puerto Rican activists seized a building on New York's [[Lower East Side]] and opened it as a collectively run cultural center. [[ABC No Rio]] was passed on to successive managements until today it is an [[anarchist]] cultural center run by a collective with close ties to the publishing group [[Autonomedia]]."&lt;ref&gt;Alan W. Moore, ''Artists' Collectives: Focus on New York, 1975-2000'' in ''Collectivism After Modernism: The Art of Social Imagination after 1945'', Blake Stimson &amp; Gregory Sholette, (eds) University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 2007, pp. 193-221&lt;/ref&gt;

"In the bohemia of downtown [[Manhattan]], the band - and crew - based practices of [[art rock]] and [[super-8 film]] making thrived. The first artists' group to achieve prominence in New York was Colab (Collaborative Projects), which produced a show in [[Times Square]] in 1980. This exhibition was a groundswell of popularly accessible socially themed artworks held in an empty building that has housed an erotic [[massage parlor]]. Critics called it "[[punk art]]" -- "three cord art anyone can play." The South Bronx art space [[Fashion Moda]].  participated in the '''Times Square Show''', bringing in some of the new generation of [[graffiti art]]ists who had been exhibiting in the [[Bronx]] as part of the [[hip-hop]] culture of writers, [[rapper]]s, and [[break dance]]rs.  A forty-member democratically run membership group; Colab inspired other artists to form groups and mount huge shows in [[Brooklyn]] lofts, not to mention collaboration with the [[Washington Project for the Arts]], for the [[Ritz Hotel Project, Washington, D.C.|Ritz Hotel Project]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1983.

==A Book About Colab (and Related Activities)==
In 2016 "A Book About Colab (and Related Activities)" was published by [[Printed Matter, Inc]]. It was edited by Max Schumann, the director of Printed Matter, and contained a Foreword and Afterword by art writer and Colab member [[Walter Robinson (art critic and artist)|Walter Robinson]]. The book traces the output of Collaborative Projects from the late 1970s through the mid 1980s and serves as an exhaustive homage to the group’s work and a testimonial about their particular practice of collaboration, collectivity, and social engagement, while reflecting an iconic period of NYC cultural history.&lt;ref&gt;Max Schumann (ed.) ''A Book about Colab (and Related Activities)'' Printed Matter, Inc, 2016: p.9&lt;/ref&gt;
In keeping with the democratic "by and for artists" ethos of Colab, the publication places this material alongside newly solicited texts from many of the group’s members – a mix of reflections and anecdotes, statements, manifestos, and excerpts from the ‘Colab Annual Report’, which provide a close perspective on the meaning of Colab for those who came into its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.printedmatter.org/events/437 ''A More Store &amp; A Book About Colab (and Related Activities'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
In 2008, a small partial retrospective exhibition called ''Colab Redux'' was held at Brooke Alexander Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baeditions.com/installation-views/colab-redux/colab-redux-installation.htm Colab Redux installation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baeditions.com/installation-views/colab-redux/colab-redux-press-release.htm Colab Redux PR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Printed Matter, Inc. presented an exhibition entitled ''A Show about Colab (and Related Activities)''. This overarching survey presented a wide range of materials and artworks from various Colab activities from the late 1970s through the mid 1980s, including screenings of film and video works, and cable broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://printedmatter.org/news/news.cfm?article_id=857 |title=''A Show about Colab (and Related Activities)'' |access-date=2013-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524220857/http://www.printedmatter.org/news/news.cfm?article_id=857 |archive-date=2012-05-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, The [[Hunter College]] Art Galleries presented ''Times Square Show Revisited'', an in-depth look at the original ''Times Square Show'' (1980). ''Times Square Show Revisited'' was the first focused assessment of the landmark exhibition organized by the artist group Collaborative Projects, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timessquareshowrevisited.com/press.html Times Square Show Revisited]&lt;/ref&gt; Bobby G's audio piece ''Times Sq. Show Audio'' (0:38) appears on ''[[Just Another Asshole]]'', a compilation anthology LP that was released in 1981 and reissued in 1995 on Atavistic Records.

In 2013, an exhibition workshop entitled ''XFR STN (Transfer Station)'' was held at the [[New Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/arts/design/xfr-stn-offers-a-digital-update-at-the-new-museum.html?ref=todayspaper&amp;_r=1&amp; |title=Preserving That Great Performance - XFR STN Offers a Digital Update at the New Museum |work=''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening night featured ''Moving Image Artists' Distribution Then &amp; Now'' an assembly of participants in the ''MWF video club'', introduced by [[Andrea Callard]], Michael Carter, [[Alan W. Moore]], [[Nick Zedd]] and [[Coleen Fitzgibbon]]. Alan W. Moore created ''MWF Club'' in 1986 as a distribution company for ''Potato Wolf and All Color News'' Colab's television programs that aired on public access TV. ''MWF Club'' expanded to include programs from various other groups such as Communications Update, Downtown TV, [[Glenn O'Brien]]'s TV Party, [[New Cinema]], [[Cinema of Transgression]], Naked Eye Cinema and numerous artists and filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/xfr-stn XFR STN at the New Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013 Tom Warren's ''Photo Portfolio of Colab Artists Portraits (1981-1984)'' were featured at Gallery 98&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.98bowery.com/tom-warren-portfolio-of-portraits-of-colab-artists-10-photographs-1981-1984/] Tom Warren, ''Photo Portfolio COLAB Artists Portraits, 1981-1984''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Film-Makers' Cooperative]] presented a mini [[video]] [[retrospective]] entitled ''Colab TV Video Excerpts'' on November 15 at [[Soho House (club)|Soho House]] in New York City with discussion with [[Tom Otterness]].

In early 2014, there were four concurrent art exhibitions in New York City around ''[[The Real Estate Show]]'': at James Fuentes Gallery,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bedfordandbowery.com/2014/04/a-legendary-exhibition-the-real-estate-show-has-been-revived-on-the-les/] Article on James Fuentes Gallery show ''Real Estate Show, Then...And Now''&lt;/ref&gt; [[ABC No Rio]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/lower-east-side-the-real-estate-show-redux] ''Lower East Side: The Real Estate Show Redux'' by Natasha Kurchanova at Studio International&lt;/ref&gt; the Lodge Gallery, and Cuchifritos Gallery/Essex Street Market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2014/03/the-real-estate-show-revisted-at-the-james-fuentes-gallery.html] ''The Real Estate Show Revisited''&lt;/ref&gt; That year also [[Art International Radio]] featured an interview and conversation between [[Jane Dickson]], [[Coleen Fitzgibbon]], and Becky Howland about Colab and the 1980 [[The Real Estate Show]] which birthed the [[ABC No Rio]] cultural center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clocktower.org/show/colab-abc-no-rio-a-history] [[Art International Radio]] Colab interview&lt;/ref&gt;

From April 15 to May 15, 2016, [[Printed Matter, Inc]] presented a restating of ''The A. More Store'', a Colab-sponsored artists’ outlet for low-priced multiples from the early 1980s The selling exhibition included over 100 artworks from over 50 participating Colab members, including works on loan from historic ''A. More Stores''. The first ''A. More Store'' evolved from the Gift Shop at the legendary Colab-organized ''Times Square Show'' and appeared shortly after on Broome Street in 1980 with the tag-line “You won’t pay more at the A. More Store”. Other iterations of the store were later presented at [[Barbara Gladstone]] Gallery, Jack Tilton Gallery, [[White Columns]], and Printed Matter, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.printedmatter.org/events/437] Printed Matter, Inc Exhibition for ''A More Store'' &amp; ''A Book About Colab (and Related Activities)''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clocktower Productions]] web exhibited ''The Colab Vinyl Mix'',  an 80-minute audio mix (aired 5/9/16) of [[no wave]], hip hop, anti-pop, punk, funk, and [[noise music]]. These sounds provided the soundtrack to Colab art productions in the 1980s. The playlist was assembled by Sandra Seymour, Mark C of [[Live Skull]], and Robert Goldman (Bobby G). The audio files were captured from the original vinyl record by the producers and illustrate the world of such legendary projects as ''The Times Square Show'', ''The Real Estate Show'', [[ABC No Rio]], Fashion Moda. The mix includes the [[post-punk]] sounds of [[Y Pants]], [[DNA (American band)|DNA]], [[Teenage Jesus and the Jerks]], [[Alan Vega]], [[The Lounge Lizards]], [[Bush Tetras]], [[Glenn Branca]] as The Static, [[ESG (band)|ESG]], [[Robin Crutchfield]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clocktower.org/show/the-colab-vinyl-mix ''The Colab Vinyl Mix'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April 20 and May 15, 2016 an art historic street posters show from 1984 called ''Talk is Cheap'' at Printed Matter, Inc. Sponsored by Colab and organized by John Hogan in 1984, the show featured 47 two-color  broadsides posted in the streets around downtown New York. The posters addressed political and economic issues of the time. The original ephemeral exhibition lasted a few days, as the posters were covered by signage and eventually posted over. Colab collaborators include [[Charlie Ahearn]], [[Jane Dickson]], [[Kiki Smith]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], [[Jolie Stahl]], [[Mitch Corber]], [[Andrea Callard]], Christy Rupp, [[Alan W. Moore]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.printedmatter.org/tables/1283] Event Exhibition for ''A More Store'' &amp; ''A Book About Colab (and Related Activities)'' at Printed Matter, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Becky Howland &amp; Matthias Mayer curated ''The Real Estate Show'' at Spor Klubu in Berlin, drawing from documentation of the original ''Real Estate Show'' (1980) from the Archive Collection of the extant project space [[ABC No Rio]]. Included in the show were Robert Cooney, Mitch Corber, Peter Fend, Coleen Fitzgibbon, Bobby G (Robert Goldman), Ilona Granet, Becky Howland, Christof Kohlhofer, Gregory Lehmann, Ann Messner, Peter Mönnig, Alan Moore, Joseph Nechvatal, Cara Perlman, Scott Pfaffman, Christy Rupp and Robin Winters. In conjunction with this show, another exhibition called ''The Real Estate Show Extended/Berlin: Group exhibition on the subject of [[Gentrification]], Real Estate Speculation and Selling out the City'' was presented at Kunstpunkt Berlin. This show included many Berlin artists along with four original members of the ''Real Estate Show'' (1980): Becky Howland, Peter Mönnig, Alan Moore, and Joseph Nechvatal. Howland, Mönnig, Moore and Nechvatal also participated in a panel discussion on Real Estate and Art on June 3, 2017 that was moderated by Howard McCalebb of Dada Post, Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunstpunkt.com/pages/ausstell_fr.htm] ''The Real Estate Show'' at Kunstpunkt Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1493">'''Concrete''', in [[perfumery]], is a semi-solid mass obtained by [[solvent extraction]] of fresh plant material.

== Sources ==
Concretes are produced mainly from flowers ([[rose]], [[jasmine]], [[tuberose]], [[Narcissus jonquilla|jonquil]], [[ylang-ylang]], [[mimosa]], [[boronia]], etc.), but also from other plant materials ([[lavender]], [[lavandin]], [[geranium]], [[clary sage]], [[Viola (plant)|violet]] leaves, [[oak moss]], etc.). A yield of ca. 0.3&amp;nbsp;% based on the starting flower material, is obtained in the production of jasmine concrete.

== Production ==
Fresh plant material is extracted with [[nonpolar]] [[solvent]]s (e. g., [[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[hexane]], [[petroleum ether]]). On evaporation of the solvent, a semi-solid residue of [[essential oil]]s, [[wax]]es, [[resin]]s and other [[lipophilic]] (oil-soluble) plant chemicals remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Karl-Georg Fahlbusch | contribution=Flavors and Fragrances | title=[[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]] | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | year=2007 | page=83|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Because of the heavier nonvolatile compounds (waxes, resins), concretes are only partially soluble in [[ethanol]]. Therefore, they are of limited use in perfumery, but they can be employed for scenting soaps.

The concrete may be extracted with ethanol to produce an [[Absolute (perfumery)|absolute]].

'''Contemporary African art''' is commonly understood to be art made by artists in Africa and the African diaspora in the post-independence era. However, there are about as many understandings of contemporary African art as there are curators, scholars and artists working in that field. All three terms of this "wide-reaching noncategory [sic]"&lt;ref&gt;Firstenberg, Lauri (2003). "Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art – Production, Exhibition, Commodification", in Farrell, L. A., V. Byvanck (eds), ''Looking Both Ways: Art of the Contemporary African Diaspora''. New York: Museum for African Art, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; are problematic in themselves: What exactly is "contemporary", what makes art "African", and when are we talking about art and not any other kind of creative expression? Western scholars and curators have made numerous attempts at defining contemporary African art in the 1990s and early 2000s and proposed a range of categories and genres. They triggered heated debates and controversies especially on the foundations of postcolonial critique. Recent trends indicate a far more relaxed engagement with definitions and identity ascriptions. The global presence and entanglement of Africa and its contemporary artists have become a widely acknowledged fact that still requires and provokes critical reflection but finds itself beyond the pressure of self-justification.

== Scope ==
Although African art has always been contemporary to its producers, the term "contemporary African art" implies a particular kind of art that has conquered, or, as some would say, has been absorbed by the international art world and art market since the 1980s. It is in that decade when Europe and the US became aware of art made in Africa by individual artists, thus breaking with the colonial tradition of assuming collective "ethnic" origins of so-called "tribal art" as found in most ethnographic collections.&lt;ref name="Firstenberg, Lauri 2003 p. 37-41"&gt;Firstenberg (2003). "Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art", in Farrell and Byvanck (eds), ''Looking Both Ways'', pp. 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition ''Magiciens de la terre'' by [[Jean-Hubert Martin]] in 1989 is widely considered (but also challenged as) a key exhibition in this very recent history of international reception of African and other non-western art.  However, this reception, too, has its roots in an exotizing and mystifying view on African culture from a dominant western position, as [[Rasheed Araeen]] argued in his response to ''Magiciens de la terre''.&lt;ref name="Araeen, Rasheed 1989 p. 3-16"&gt;Araeen, Rasheed (1989). "Our Bauhaus Others' Mudhouse", ''Third Text'' no. 6, pp. 3–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Firstenberg, Lauri (2003). “Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art – Production, Exhibition, Commodification”, in Farrell, L. A., Byvanck, V. (eds), ''Looking both Ways: Art of the Contemporary African Diaspora''. New York: Museum for African Art, pp. 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, although this exhibition and many that followed had a strong influence in creating a kind of a common understanding of what constitutes contemporary African art, it is true that it has been and still is subject to discussions and controversies. Almost every exhibition following ''Magiciens de la terre'' offered a taxonomy or system of categorization that helped to reflect the very notion of contemporary African art, but they failed to recognize the postcolonial need of giving up the Eurocentric epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;Mosquera, Gerardo (1995). “Das Marco-Polo-Syndrom”, in Hermanns, U. (ed.), ''Havanna. Sao Paulo. Junge Kunst aus Lateinamerika''. Berlin: Haus der Kulturen der Welt, p. 34-39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Firstenberg, Lauri 2003 p. 37-41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nzegwu, Nkiru 1998 p. 1-18"&gt;Nzegwu, Nkiru (1998). "Introduction: Contemporary African Art and Exclusionary Politics", ''Issues in Contemporary African Art''. Binghamton, NY: International Society for the Study of Africa ISSA, pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary African art is believed to feature particularities typical to African aesthetics while at the same time it shares properties with other international contemporary arts. Therefore, it is both, shaped by and feeding into the globalizing art worlds and art markets, like any other contemporary arts. At the same time, there are a lot of contemporary art practices and forms in African regions and cities that are almost exclusively locally known. While meeting all three requirements of being contemporary, art, and African, they fail to fit into a certain type of art production that has been spreading on the international art market in the last 30 years.

Exhibitions variously showed work by artists based in Africa; by artists using aesthetics typical to African traditions; by African artists living in the West but including aesthetics and topics related to their "roots";&lt;ref name="Araeen, Rasheed 1989 p. 3-16"/&gt; traditional artworks related to customary practices such as rituals; and urban African art that reflects the modern experience of cultural pluralism and hybridity. Modernity as a colonial and postcolonial experience appears as an intrinsic and significant attribute in most conceptions of contemporary African art. Scholars and curators therefore have proposed a wide range of taxonomies that tried firstly to define what is African about this art, and secondly, the range of genres it covers. Diverse attempts to define particular genres of contemporary African art however mirrored the fascination of art scholars and curators for the appropriation of cultural elements assumed "Western" into "African" modes of expression and traditions. One example is Marshall W. Mount&lt;ref&gt;Mount, Marshall W. (1973). ''African Art: The Years since 1920.'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed four categories: first, "survivals of traditional styles", which show continuities in traditional working material and methods such as bronze casting or wood carving; secondly, art inspired by Christian missions; thirdly, souvenir art in the sense of tourist or airport art as defined later by Jules-Rossette;&lt;ref&gt;Jules-Rosette, Bennetta (1984). ''The Messages of Tourist Art: An African Semiotic System in Comparative Perspective.'' Boston: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; and finally, an emerging art requiring "techniques that were unknown or rare in traditional African art".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall W. Mount (1973) quoted in: Mudimbe, Valentin Y. (1991). "'Reprendre': Enunciations and Strategies in Contemporary African Arts", in Vogel, S. (ed.), ''Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art''. Munich: Prestel, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; Valentin Y. Mudimbe in turn proposes to think of three currents rather than categories, namely a "tradition-inspired" one, a "modernist" trend, and "a popular art"&lt;ref name="Mudimbe, Valentin Y. 1991 p. 280"&gt;Mudimbe, Valentin Y. (1991). "'Reprendre': Enunciations and Strategies in Contemporary African Arts", in Vogel, S. (ed.), ''Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art''. Munich: Prestel, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; whereby Mount’s categories would be situated somewhere "between the tradition-inspired and the modernist trend”.&lt;ref name="Mudimbe, Valentin Y. 1991 p. 280"/&gt; Similar to other categorizations, this proposal considers the education of the artists as well as the envisaged clientele/patrons as important factors for the respective "currents". In the exhibition catalogue of ''Africa Explores'' (1991), curator Susan Vogel distinguished between "traditional art", "new functional art", "urban art", "international art", and "extinct art".&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Susan, ed. (1991). ''Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art''. Munich: Prestel.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting these categories, collector André Magnin proposed to group similar works into sections named "territory", "frontier" and "world" in his survey book ''Contemporary African Art'', thus placing them into "imaginary maps".&lt;ref&gt;Magnin, André, and Jacques Soulillou, eds (1996). ''Contemporary Art of Africa.'' London: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this approach was also criticized by Dele Jegede with convincing arguments against its ethnocentric perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Jegede, Dele (1998). "On Scholars and Magicians: A Review of 'Contemporary Art of Africa'", in Nzegwu, N. (ed.), ''Issues in Contemporary African Art''. Binghamton: International Society for the Study of Africa ISSA, pp. 187-195.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, he pointed to the hubris of attempts to talk about art of a whole continent, but also to the common reflex to exclude Northern Africa in such considerations and to follow a global rather than "particularistic focus on the study of the art of the continent" that would provide more specific and deeper bodies of knowledge. In the 1990 exhibition ''Contemporary African Artists: Changing Tradition'', the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]] tried to take the perspective of the presented artists and distinguished between African artists who refuse outside influences; African artists who adopt modes of Western art; and African artists who fuse both strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Studio Museum, ed. (1990): ''Contemporary African Artists. Changing Tradition''. New York: Studio Museum in Harlem.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonality to all these categorizations is their reliance on dichotomies between art and craft, Europe and Africa, urban and rural, and traditional and contemporary. These dichotomies tend to consider mutual influences in African and European art as an exception rather than the norm. Even more, they fail to think of African art independent from Europe as its counterpart or "influence", resulting in a frequent reproach of African artists "copycatting" or "mimicking" European achievements of modernism.&lt;ref name="Oguibe, Olu 1999 p. 16-29"&gt;Oguibe, Olu (1999). "Art, Identity, Boundaries: Postmodernism and Contemporary African Art", in Oguibe, O., and O. Enwezor (eds), ''Reading the Contemporary: African Art from Theory to the Marketplace''. Cambridge: MIT Press, pp. 16–29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nzegwu, Nkiru 1998 p. 1-18"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Enwezor, Okwui, and Chika Okeke-Agulu (2009). ''Contemporary African Art since 1980.'' Bologna: Damiani, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasfir, Sidney L. (1999). ''Contemporary African Art.'' London/New York: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; Such Eurocentric attitudes have been revealingly criticized by theorists such as [[Olu Oguibe]],&lt;ref name="Oguibe, Olu 1999 p. 16-29"/&gt; Rasheed Araeen,&lt;ref name="Araeen, Rasheed 1989 p. 3-16"/&gt; Nkiru Nzegwu,&lt;ref name="Nzegwu, Nkiru 1998 p. 1-18"/&gt; [[Okwui Enwezor]] or Salah Hassan.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Salah (1999). "The Modernist Experience in African Art: Visual Expressions of the Self and Cross-cultural Aesthetics", in Oguibe, O., and O. Enwezor (eds), ''Reading the Contemporary: African Art from Theory to the Marketplace''. Cambridge: MIT Press, pp. 214–235.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is not easy to solve, and in some cases it is tackled by simply subverting any attempt of categorization. ''Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa'', directed by [[Clémentine Deliss]] and curated by [[Chika Okeke-Agulu]], Salah Hassan, [[David Koloane]], Wanjiku Nyachae and El Hadji Sy (London, 1995) is a case in point.&lt;ref&gt;Deliss, Clémentine, ed. (1995). ''Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa.'' Paris/New York: Flammarion.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than grafting binary taxonomies, it narrated seven modern art histories in different parts of Africa by invited curators and artists who were familiar with these recent histories and their respective art scenes. The exhibition proved to offer a highly complex, historically informed and well-researched presentation. Another example for subverting binary taxonomies is the book ''Contemporary African Art after 1980'' by Okwui Enwezor and Chika Okeke-Agulu.&lt;ref&gt;Enwezor, Okwui, and Chika Okeke-Agulu (2009). ''Contemporary African Art since 1980.'' Bologna: Damiani.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than putting contemporary African art in relation to Western traditions, they contrast it with modern African art, in that it defies linear grand narratives of modernism and is radically postcolonial. "[F]irst, within categories of time, it is neither belated nor does it exist out of time; second, because it is post-historical, it did not emerge out of a succession of historical styles; third, because it is critical of colonial valorization of an authentic past, it is postcolonial; and fourth, in relation to its postcoloniality, it seeks, according to Hans Belting’s thesis, to be post-ethnic […]. Neither being out of time nor belated, contemporary African art strategically inhabits a third epistemological space by being in time."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As they add, this being "fundamentally of its time" counts for all contemporary art, not only the African. In their book, Enwezor and Okeke-Agulu discuss contemporary African art by its approaches and guiding topics rather than trying to define categories on the basis of styles, markets or traditions. Their chapters therefore are designated as "Between postcolonial utopia and postcolonial realism", "Networks of practice" in the globalized field of cultural production, "Politics, culture and critique", "Archive, document, memory", "Abstraction, figuration and subjectivity" and "The body politic: difference, gender, sexuality". Doing so, they locate contemporary African art within a historical perspective, something that had largely missed in previous discussions.

[[File:Dandys 1830.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sporty Parisian dandies of the 1830s: a tight [[corset]] helped one achieve his silhouette. The man on the left wears a [[frock]], the man on the right wears [[morning dress]].]]

A '''dandy''', historically, is a man who places particular importance upon [[physical appearance]], refined language, and leisurely hobbies, pursued with the appearance of nonchalance in a cult of [[self]].&lt;ref&gt;"One who studies ostentatiously to dress fashionably and elegantly; a [[fop]], an exquisite." (''[[OED]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Oxford English Dictionary | year = 1989 | url=http://dictionary.oed.com |quote=dude, n. U.S.A name given in ridicule to a man affecting an exaggerated fastidiousness in dress, speech, and deportment, and very particular about what is æsthetically 'good form'; hence, extended to an exquisite, a dandy, 'a swell'. | publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cult de soi-même'', [[Charles Baudelaire]], "Le Dandy", noted in Susann Schmid, "Byron and Wilde: The Dandy in the Public Sphere" in Julie Hibbard ''et al.'' , eds. ''The Importance of Reinventing Oscar: versions of Wilde during the last 100 years'' 2002&lt;/ref&gt; A dandy could be a self-made man who strove to imitate an [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] lifestyle despite coming from a [[middle-class]] background, especially in late 18th- and early 19th-century [[Great Britain|Britain]].

Previous manifestations of the ''petit-maître'' (French for "small master") and the [[Muscadin]] have been noted by John C. Prevost,&lt;ref&gt;''Le Dandysme en France (1817–1839)'' (Geneva and Paris) 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; but the modern practice of dandyism first appeared in the revolutionary 1790s, both in [[London]] and in [[Paris]]. The dandy cultivated cynical reserve, yet to such extremes that novelist [[George Meredith]], himself no dandy, once defined [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] as "intellectual dandyism". Some took a more benign view; [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote in ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' that a dandy was no more than "a clothes-wearing man". [[Honoré de Balzac]] introduced the perfectly worldly and unmoved Henri de Marsay in ''[[La fille aux yeux d'or]]'' (1835), a part of ''[[La Comédie Humaine]]'', who fulfils at first the model of a perfect dandy, until an obsessive love-pursuit unravels him in passionate and murderous jealousy.

[[Charles Baudelaire]] defined the dandy, in the later "metaphysical" phase of dandyism,&lt;ref&gt;See Prevost 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; as one who elevates [[æsthetics]] to a living religion,&lt;ref&gt;Baudelaire, in his essay about painter [[Constantin Guys]], "The Painter of Modern Life".&lt;/ref&gt; that the dandy's mere existence reproaches the responsible citizen of the middle class: "Dandyism in certain respects comes close to spirituality and to [[stoicism]]" and "These beings have no other status, but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons, of satisfying their passions, of feeling and thinking .... Dandyism is a form of Romanticism. Contrary to what many thoughtless people seem to believe, dandyism is not even an excessive delight in clothes and material elegance. For the perfect dandy, these things are no more than the symbol of the aristocratic superiority of mind."

The linkage of clothing with political protest had become a particularly English characteristic during the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Aileen Ribeiro, "On Englishness in dress" in ''The Englishness of English Dress'', Christopher Breward, Becky Conekin and Caroline Cox, ed., 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Given these connotations, dandyism can be seen as a political protest against the levelling of [[egalitarian]] principles, often including nostalgic adherence to feudal or pre-industrial values, such as the ideals of "the perfect gentleman" or "the autonomous aristocrat". Paradoxically, the dandy required an audience, as Susann Schmid observed in examining the "successfully marketed lives" of [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Lord Byron]], who exemplify the dandy's roles in the public sphere, both as writers and as ''personae'' providing sources of gossip and [[scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmid 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nigel Rodgers]] in ''The Dandy: Peacock or Enigma?'' questions Wilde's status as a genuine dandy, seeing him as someone who only assumed a dandified stance in passing, not a man dedicated to the exacting ideals of dandyism.

== Etymology ==

The origin of the word is uncertain. ''Eccentricity'', defined as taking characteristics such as dress and appearance to extremes, began to be applied generally to human behavior in the 1770s;&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro 2002:20, under the subheading "Eccentricity, Extremes, and Affectation".&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, the word ''dandy'' first appears in the late 18th century:  In the years immediately preceding the American Revolution, the first verse and chorus of "[[Yankee Doodle]]" derided the alleged poverty and rough manners of American-citizen colonists, suggesting that whereas a fine horse and gold-braided clothing ("[[Maccaroni (fashion)|mac[c]aroni]]") were required to set a dandy apart from those around him, the average American-citizen colonists means were so meager that ownership of a mere pony and a few feathers for personal ornamentation would qualify one of them as a "dandy" by comparison to and/or in the minds of his even less sophisticated Eurasian compatriots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/apr19.html#yankee "Yankee Doodle"]; [[Maccaroni (fashion)|Maccaroni]].&lt;/ref&gt; A slightly later [[Border ballad|Scottish border ballad]], circa 1780,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Oxford English Dictionary | year = 1989 | url=http://dictionary.oed.com |quote=dandy 1.a. One who studies above everything to dress elegantly and fashionably; a beau, fop, 'exquisite'.  c1780 Sc. Song (see [[Notes and Queries|N. &amp; Q.]] 8th Ser.

The original, full form of 'dandy' may have been ''jack-a-dandy''.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[vogue word]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In that contemporary slang, a "dandy" was differentiated from a "[[fop]]" in that the dandy's dress was more refined and sober than the fop's.

In the twenty-first century, the word ''dandy'' is a jocular, often sarcastic adjective meaning "fine" or "great"; when used in the form of a noun, it refers to a well-groomed and well-dressed man, but often to one who is also self-absorbed.

== Beau Brummell and early British dandyism ==
[[File:BrummellDighton1805.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Caricature of [[Beau Brummell]] by [[Richard Dighton]] (1805).]]
The model dandy in British society was [[Beau Brummell|George Bryan "Beau" Brummell]] (1778–1840), in his early days, an undergraduate student at [[Oriel College, Oxford]] and later, an associate of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]].  Brummell was not from an aristocratic background; indeed, his greatness was "based on nothing at all," as [[Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly|J.A. Barbey d'Aurevilly]] observed in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Barbey d'Aurevilly, "Du dandisme et de George Brummell," (published 1845, collected in ''Oeuvres complètes'' 1925:87–92).&lt;/ref&gt; Never unpowdered or unperfumed, immaculately bathed and shaved, and dressed in a plain dark blue coat,&lt;ref&gt;"In Regency England, Brummel's fashionable simplicity constituted in fact a criticism of the exuberant French fashions of the eighteenth century" (Schmid 2002:83),&lt;/ref&gt; he was always perfectly brushed, perfectly fitted, showing much perfectly starched linen, all freshly laundered, and composed with an elaborately knotted [[cravat]]. From the mid-1790s, Beau Brummell was the early incarnation of "the celebrity", a man chiefly famous for ''being'' famous.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

By the time [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|taxed hair powder]] in 1795 to help pay for the war against France and to discourage the use of flour (which had recently increased in both rarity and price, owing to bad harvests) in such a frivolous product, Brummell had already abandoned wearing a wig, and had his hair cut in the Roman fashion, "à la Brutus". Moreover, he led the transition from [[breeches]] to snugly tailored dark "[[Trousers|pantaloons]]," which directly led to contemporary trousers, the sartorial mainstay of men's clothes in the Western world for the past two centuries. In 1799, upon coming of age, Beau Brummell inherited from his father a fortune of thirty thousand pounds, which he spent mostly on costume, gambling, and high living. In 1816 he suffered bankruptcy, the dandy's stereotyped fate; he fled his creditors to France, quietly dying in 1840, in a [[lunatic asylum]] in [[Caen]], just before age 62.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Men of more notable accomplishments than Beau Brummell also adopted the dandiacal pose: [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron]] occasionally dressed the part, helping reintroduce the frilled, lace-cuffed and lace-collared "[[poet shirt]]". In that spirit, he had his portrait painted in Albanian costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/byron-portrait|title=Portrait of Lord Byron in Albanian Dress, 1813|website=The British Library|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prominent dandy of the period was [[Alfred Guillaume Gabriel d'Orsay]], the Count d'Orsay, who had been friends with Byron and who moved in the highest social circles of London.

In 1836 [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;A Dandy is a clothes-wearing Man, a Man whose trade, office and existence consists in the wearing of Clothes. Every faculty of his soul, spirit, purse, and person is heroically consecrated to this one object, the wearing of Clothes wisely and well: so that the others dress to live, he lives to dress ... And now, for all this perennial [[Martyrdom]], and Poesy, and even [[Prophecy]], what is it that the Dandy asks in return? Solely, we may say, that you would recognise his existence; would admit him to be a living object; or even failing this, a visual object, or thing that will reflect rays of light...&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Carlyle]], "The Dandiacal Body", in ''[[Sartor Resartus]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the mid-19th century, the English dandy, within the muted palette of male fashion, exhibited minute refinements—"The quality of the fine woollen cloth, the slope of a pocket flap or coat revers, exactly the right colour for the gloves, the correct amount of shine on boots and shoes, and so on. It was an image of a well-dressed man who, while taking infinite pains about his appearance, affected indifference to it. This refined dandyism continued to be regarded as an essential strand of male Englishness."&lt;ref&gt;Ribeira 2002:21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dandyism in France ==
[[File:Murat2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Joachim Murat]], the French [[King of Naples]], was dubbed the "Dandy King" because of his highly groomed appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZbjtGC48-8C&amp;pg=PA247&amp;lpg=PA247 |title=10,000 Famous Freemasons from K to Z |publisher=Books.google.com |date=30 September 2004 |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The beginnings of dandyism in France were bound to the politics of the [[French revolution]]; the initial stage of dandyism, the [[jeunesse dorée|gilded youth]], was a political statement of dressing in an aristocratic style in order to distinguish its members from the [[sans-culottes]].

During his heyday, [[Beau Brummell]]'s ''dictat'' on both fashion and etiquette reigned supreme. His habits of dress and fashion were much imitated, especially in France, where, in a curious development, they became the rage, especially in [[bohemianism|bohemian]] quarters. There, dandies sometimes were celebrated in revolutionary terms: self-created men of consciously designed personality, radically breaking with past traditions. With elaborate dress and idle, [[decadence|decadent]] styles of life, French bohemian dandies sought to convey [[contempt]] for and superiority to bourgeois society. In the latter 19th century, this fancy-dress bohemianism was a major influence on the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movement]] in French literature.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

[[Baudelaire]] was deeply interested in dandyism, and memorably wrote that a dandy aspirant must have "no profession other than elegance... no other status, but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons... The dandy must aspire to be sublime without interruption; he must live and sleep before a mirror." Other French intellectuals also were interested in the dandies strolling the streets and [[boulevard]]s of Paris. [[Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly]] wrote ''[[On Dandyism and George Brummell]]'', an essay devoted, in great measure, to examining the career of Beau Brummell.&lt;ref name=Walden&gt;[[George Walden]], ''Who's a Dandy? – Dandyism and Beau Brummell'', Gibson Square, London, 2002. {{ISBN|1903933188}}.

== Later dandyism ==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Montesquiou, Robert de - Boldini.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Robert de Montesquiou]] (1855–1921) portrait by [[Giovanni Boldini]]]]
The literary dandy is a familiar figure in the writings, and sometimes the self-presentation, of [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Saki|H.H. Munro]] (Clovis and Reginald), [[P.G. Wodehouse]] ([[Bertie Wooster]]) and [[Ronald Firbank]], writers linked by their subversive air.

The poets [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] and [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Walter Pater]], the American artist [[James McNeill Whistler]], the Spanish artist [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]], and [[Max Beerbohm]] were dandies of the [[Belle Époque]], as was [[Robert de Montesquiou]] — [[Marcel Proust]]'s inspiration for the Baron de Charlus. In Italy, [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] and [[Carlo Bugatti]] exemplified the artistic bohemian dandyism of the [[fin de siecle]]. Wilde wrote that, "One should either be a work of Art, or wear a work of Art."

At the end of the 19th century, American dandies were called [[dude]]s. [[Evander Berry Wall]] was nicknamed the "King of the Dudes".

[[George Walden]], in the essay ''Who's a Dandy?'', identifies [[Noël Coward]], [[Andy Warhol]], and [[Quentin Crisp]] as modern dandies.&lt;ref name=Walden/&gt; The character [[Psmith]] in the novels of [[P. G. Wodehouse]] is considered a dandy, both physically and intellectually. Agatha Christie's Poirot is said to be a dandy.

The artist [[Sebastian Horsley]] described himself as a "dandy in the underworld" in his [[eponymous]] autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200610160054 Beautiful and damned], ''[[New Statesman]]'', 16 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, dandyism became a [[Lolita Fashion#Ōji (Boystyle)|fashion subculture]] during the late 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In Spain during the early 19th century a curious phenomenon developed linked to the idea of dandyism. While in England and France individuals from the middle classes adopted aristocratic manners, the Spanish aristocracy adopted the fashions of the lower classes, called [[majos]]. They were characterized by their elaborate outfits and sense of style as opposed to the modern Frenchified "[[afrancesados]]", as for their cheeky arrogant attitude.
Some famous dandies in later times were amongst other the [[Duke of Osuna]], Mariano Tellez-Girón, artist [[Salvador Dalí]] and poet [[Luis Cernuda|Luís Cernuda]].

== Later thought ==
[[Albert Camus]] said in ''[[The Rebel (book)|L'Homme révolté]]'' (1951) that: &lt;blockquote&gt;The dandy creates his own unity by aesthetic means. But it is an aesthetic of negation. "To live and die before a mirror": that according to Baudelaire, was the dandy's slogan. It is indeed a coherent slogan. The dandy is, by occupation, always in opposition. He can only exist by defiance. Up to now, man derived his coherence from the Creator. But from the moment that he consecrates his rupture from Him, he finds himself delivered over to the fleeting moment, to the passing days, and to wasted sensibility. Therefore he must take himself in hand. The dandy rallies his forces and creates a unity for himself by the very violence of his refusal. Profligate, like all people without a rule of life, he is only coherent as an actor. But an actor implies a public; the dandy can only play a part by setting himself up in opposition. He can only be sure of his own existence by finding it in the expression of others' faces. Other people are his mirror. A mirror that quickly becomes clouded, it's true, since human capacity for attention is limited. It must be ceaselessly stimulated, spurred on by provocation. The dandy, therefore, is always compelled to astonish. Singularity is his vocation, excess his way to perfection. Perpetually incomplete, always on the fringe of things, he compels others to create him, while denying their values. He plays at life because he is unable to live it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Albert|last=Camus|authorlink=Albert Camus|title=[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt]]|date=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780307827838|page=51|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_3yQrhdxwUC&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=11 October 2014|chapter=II Metaphysical Rebellion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jean Baudrillard]] said that dandyism is "an aesthetic form of nihilism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/simulacra-and-simulations-xviii-on-nihilism/ |title=Jean Baudrillard – Simulacra and Simulations – XVIII.

Carlos Espartaco said about the Argentinian philosopher and poet Eduardo Sanguinetti:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Only the dandy, last heir of the stoic tentative, has imposed himself in the world of appearance as a thing and has evaded fashion in the name of a "mode" that would be inseparable of him. Actually, it is necessary to summon the void in itself, to conqueror the cool way that qualifies the dandy, which is "thousand of kilometers farther from immediate sensations". And for Eduardo Sanguinetti this means, in terms of the multiple strategics he will use in the passages from "anti-fashion" to "look" a radical self-emptying that emancipates from time, but that does not reject the effort that has to do to register the emerging novelty. Obtaining this space resembles a landscape, where, in accordance with Baudelaire "carries Hercules upon his shoulders".&lt;ref&gt;Espartaco Carlos 1989 "Eduardo Sanguinetti: The Experience of Limits" pag.98, 99 (Ediciones de Arte Gaglianone, first published 1989) {{ISBN|950-9004-98-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER--&gt;

== Quaintrelle ==
[[File:Dandizette.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1819 Dandizette]]
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2008}}
The female counterpart is a quaintrelle, a woman who emphasizes a life of passion expressed through personal style, leisurely pastimes, charm, and cultivation of life's pleasures.

In the 12th century, ''cointerrels'' (male) and ''cointrelles'' (female) emerged, based upon ''coint'',&lt;ref&gt;Old English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; a word applied to things skilfully made, later indicating a person of beautiful dress and refined speech.  By the 18th century, ''coint'' became ''quaint'',&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Early English&lt;/ref&gt; indicating elegant speech and beauty.  Middle English dictionaries note ''quaintrelle'' as a beautifully dressed woman (or overly dressed), but do not include the favorable personality elements of grace and charm.  The notion of a quaintrelle sharing the major philosophical components of refinement with dandies is a modern development that returns quaintrelles to their historic roots.

Female dandies did overlap with male dandies for a brief period during the early 19th century when ''dandy'' had a derisive definition of "fop" or "over-the-top fellow"; the female equivalents were ''dandyess'' or ''dandizette''.  Charles Dickens, in ''All the Year Around'' (1869) comments, "The dandies and dandizettes of 1819–1820 must have been a strange race. ''Dandizette'' was a term applied to feminine devotees to dress and their absurdities were fully equal to those of the dandy." In 1819, the novel ''Charms of Dandyism'' was published "by Olivia Moreland, chief of the female dandies"; although probably written by Thomas Ashe, "Olivia Moreland" may have existed, as Ashe did write several novels about living persons. Throughout the novel, dandyism is associated with "living in style".  Later, as the word ''dandy'' evolved to denote refinement, it became applied solely to men.  ''Popular Culture and Performance in the Victorian City'' (2003) notes this evolution in the latter 19th century: "...or ''dandizette'', although the term was increasingly reserved for men."

'''''Durán Madonna''''' (also known as the '''''Madonna in Red''''' or '''''Virgin and Child in a Niche'''''&lt;ref&gt;Nosow, ix&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''Madonna Enthroned''''') is an oil on oak [[panel painting]] completed sometime between 1435 and 1438 by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Netherlandish painter]] [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. The painting derives from [[Jan van Eyck| Jan van Eyck's]] ''[[Ince Hall Madonna]]'' and was much imitated subsequently.&lt;ref name= "Panofsky 259"&gt;Panofsky p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Now in the [[Museo del Prado|Prado]], Madrid, it depicts a seated and serene [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] dressed in a long, flowing red robe lined with gold-coloured thread. She cradles the child Jesus who sits on her lap, playfully leafing backwards through a holy book or manuscript on which both figures' gazes rest. But unlike van Eyck's earlier treatment, van der Weyden not only positions his Virgin and Child in a Gothic [[apse]] or [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] as he had his two earlier madonnas (the ''[[Madonna Standing (van der Weyden)|Madonna Standing]]'' and the ''[[Virgin and Child Enthroned (van der Weyden)|Virgin and Child Enthroned]]''), but also places them on a projecting plinth, thus further emphasising their sculptural impression.&lt;ref name= "Panofsky 259"/&gt;

Christ appears much older than in most contemporary paintings of this kind. He is far from an infant, and is very realistically and physically rendered. He is shown as a small child, with none of the softness of usual 15th-century depictions of the Virgin and Child.&lt;ref name="N146"&gt;Nosow, 146&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is characterised by the sculptural look that van der Weyden often favoured, and for its similarity in colourisation to his c. 1435 ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'' (Madrid) and c. 1442–45 ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' (Berlin).

The painting was acquired by Pedro Fernández-Durán in 1899 at the [[Palace of Infante don Luis (Boadilla del Monte)|Palacio de Boadilla]], Madrid. He donated the work to the [[Museo del Prado]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="C50" /&gt;

==Description==
Mary is shown in a long, red, hooded robe and white headdress, with the Child Jesus in a white shirt seated on her lap. He curiously leafs through and crumples the pages of a book perched on his mother's knee. The book is placed at the very center of the panel, symbolising the centrality of the divine Word in Christian belief.&lt;ref name="N146" /&gt; According to the Prado, the book itself represents an allusion to the "Holy Scriptures that announce Christ's redemptive mission."&lt;ref name="prado"&gt;"[http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/virgin-and-child-1/ Virgin and Child]". [[Museo del Prado]]. Retrieved 13 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; An angel in dark grey dress hovers above Mary's head, holding a pearl-encrusted crown destined for her upon her assumption as [[Queen of Heaven]].&lt;ref name="N146" /&gt; Mary's long robe swirls around the pictorial space, obscuring her throne and eventually falling at the support by her feet.&lt;ref name="N146" /&gt; They are framed by a sculpted [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] or apse with Gothic [[tracery]] similar to that found in van der Weyden's ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]''.&lt;ref name="N145"&gt;Nosow, 145&lt;/ref&gt; The curved arches of the niche echo the lines of her figure as she bends protectively over the child. These curved lines and warm colours give the work its sense of internal harmony.&lt;ref name="N145" /&gt;

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Virgin and Child (Durán Madonna) - Prado P02722 (Detail).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Detail showing the restless child leafing through the parchments of the holy book.]]
Art-historical analysis in the early to mid 20th century placed little emphasis on Christ's older age for a "Virgin and Child" work of this period. Nor did it emphasise the significance of the manuscript or the rough manner in which Christ seems to energetically leaf through it, his play watched on by a near-indulgent&lt;!--hm--&gt; Mary. More recently, art historians such as [[Alfred Acres]] have questioned the significance of the child's freedom of movement and naturalistic portrayal in such a deliberately elegant and poised work—especially in the work of such a self-aware and compositionally involved painter as van der Weyden. Acres believes that the book is central to the understanding of the painting, and notes its perfect centrality in the panel; it is the focus of both figures' gazes and hands, and Christ is apparently leafing ''backwards'' through the pages, towards the beginning.&lt;ref name="A77"&gt;Acres, 77&lt;/ref&gt; While Christ's right hand holds a number of parchments scrunched together and he pays no attention to them, his more careful left hand is about to open the lower left corner of the open page. If it is reasonably assumed that the book held open on Mary's lap is facing towards her, it seems the child is leafing backwards through the pages. While holy books were often included in 15th-century northern depictions of the Virgin, they were usually associated with the idea of the Virgin as a representation of learning or wisdom; in no other contemporary painting are they turned through with such restless energy, not to mention being turned through from end to beginning.&lt;ref name="A79"&gt;Acres, 79&lt;/ref&gt; Acres suggests that the infant Christ is leafing back towards [[Book of Genesis|Genesis: 3]] describing the [[Fall of Man]], citing three other works where van der Weyden similarly articulates the [[Redemption (theology)|redemptive theme]], including the '' Madonna Standing'' panel in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] where the Madonna is flanked by figures of Adam and Eve.&lt;ref name= "A90"&gt;Acres, 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Panofsky 261"&gt;''c.f.'' Panofsky p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Virgin and Child (Durán Madonna) - detail2.jpg|thumb|290px|Detail showing the dark winged angel hovering under the Niche holding the crown above Mary's head.]]
Art historian [[Lorne Campbell (Art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] believes the painting was influenced by [[Robert Campin]]'s Frankfurt ''[[commons:File:Robert Campin - Virgin and Child - WGA14434.jpg|Virgin and Child]]'' both in [[ideal of feminine beauty|the ideal of feminine beauty]] it presents and for its elegant use of long folded draperies. Campbell notes that both works are composed from strong diagonal lines, with the main figures pushed out into the center foreground, in an almost [[trompe-l'œil]] manner.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 19&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ''Durán Madonna'' is often compared to van der Weyden's ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'', both for the colourisation of Mary's dress and for a sculptural look similar to the reliefs shown in the earlier triptych. In addition, the underdrawing of Mary's head is strikingly similar to that of the kindly, idealised Madonna in his ''Froimont Diptych'' (after 1460), now in the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen|Musée des Beaux-Arts]], [[Caen]].&lt;ref&gt;Hand et al., 259&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these strong similarities, attribution to van der Weyden is not doubted, although the work is known to have been frequently copied in Spain after it was relocated there&lt;ref name="C50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt; sometime in the 16th century.

The black overpaint behind the Virgin was probably added at the request of a later 18th-century seller, most likely in an attempt to fashion the piece as a genre work and downplay its religious theme. Research aided by X-ray has been inconclusive and has found no lost detail or drawing beneath the thick layers of paint.&lt;ref name="C50"&gt;Campbell, 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illusionary devices==
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Portrait Diptych of Laurent Froimont (left wing) - WGA25697.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Left wing of van der Weyden's ''Froimont Diptych'', after 1460. [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen|Musée des Beaux-Arts]], [[Caen]].]]

Van der Weyden often depicted lifelike and voluminous figures set in shallow sculptural spaces, in which they seemed cramped and larger than scale. The space filled by the figures is undefined and ambiguously located. Mary and the child are supported by a projecting [[corbel]], the three-dimensionality of which gives the disorienting impression that the figures are part of a [[relief]] in a much larger work of art. This gives the work a dizzying and dislocated perspective; its own unique sense of space and placement.&lt;ref&gt;Nosow, 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is an early example of van der Weyden's habit of rendering his figures with the appearance of [[polychrome]] sculptures, an effect here accentuated by the neutral background.&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt; Van der Weyden's tendency to blur the line between sculpture and paint in an illusionistic manner can be see most effectively in his  ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]''. Art historian Robert Nosow notes the architectural aspect of the gothic frame, and the manner in which the lines of the Virgin and child make them seem as if statues come to life.&lt;ref name="N145" /&gt; Art historian Shirley Neilsen Blum writes that the faux sculptural elements, "force[s] the viewer to continually confront the seemingly real presence of two media, sculpture and painting&amp;nbsp;... Rogier defies logic and therefore enhances the magical quality of the image. Divinity is stressed because it has transcended media definition."&lt;ref&gt;Blum, 103&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Encyclopedia of Performing Arts was created by two separate projects, one dating to 1945 and the other to 1954.&lt;ref name="examenapium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examenapium.it/STUDI/Dizionari/damico.htm|title=Enciclopedia dello spettacolo, 11 voll. fondata da Silvio D'Amico  Roma: Le Maschere, 1954-1968|work=examenapium.it|language=Italian|accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early version===
Starting in 1945 or 1946, D'Amico conceived of a project to develop an encyclopedia of the performing arts. Undertaken by an editorial team composed of a few people and led by D'Amico, it was produced in three or four years and contained four volumes. Considered superficial, it was not publishable. However, it developed a model for scientific study of the theater and other performing arts.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt;

===Later version===
Conceived as a set of 12 volumes, the second project took on an ethnographic approach.  It had the advantage of a stable editorial group and used foreign employees. D'Amico's editorial staff worked at the [[Palazzo Doria Pamphili]], [[Via del Plebiscito]] 112.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt; The attorney [[Carlo Minù]], D'Amico's brother-in-law, found funding for the second project and referred D'Amico to publishers.&lt;ref name="unile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siba3.unile.it/ctle/damico/conversazione.htm|title=Conversazione sull'Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo con Alessandro D'Amico e Luigi Squarzina|work=unile.it|language=Italian|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In drawing up lists of [[dramas]], [[operas]], [[ballets]] and [[films]], the editorial team wondered if it their work was worthwhile or helpful.  It was [[Francesco Savio]] who sometimes said, "Of course it is; if someone else wants one day to create an Encyclopedia of Performing Arts, they would find this materials to be useful." When the news spread that the encyclopedia was about to be published, a delegation arrived wanting guidance in the organizational work to start up an encyclopedia of [[Prague]] theater.&lt;ref name="unile" /&gt;

The structure of the work was better articulated. Responsibility for each section, such as film, music, or theater, was delegated to an initial small staff that rapidly grew to thirty editors that coordinated over five hundred employees.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt; Large blocks of work were assigned to collaborators, many of them in foreign countries.

D'Amico felt that the second project benefited from finding amateur collectors without whose assistance entire sectors of biographical entries would have been less detailed. Collected material came from abroad or was bought directly in the antique market. An example of a collector was [[Ulderico Rolandi]], a gynecologist who lived in the [[Via Veneto]], and who had made a hobby of collecting, filing and examining [[libretto]]s. He had accumulated what was thought to be the largest collection of opera librettos after the [[Library of Congress]]. Another example was [[David Turcotte]] who had developed a catalog of American cinema.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The project suffered a severe crisis in 1957, two years after the death of D'Amico, due to disagreements between the editorial office and the publisher. The publisher's expectation was to publish two volumes a year, but the editorial staff was only able to put out a single volume each year. Because of this crisis, there is an imbalance between the first volume and the last four whose detail is considered sometimes less accurate.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt;

===Editions===
Published between 1954 and 1962, the original nine volume ''Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo'' covers ballet, films, opera, plays, theater, [[vaudeville]], and other areas of entertainment. They include signed essays that discuss performers, directors, and writers. Other sections discuss genres and themes, as well as history, technical subjects, and bibliographies.&lt;ref name="Yale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.library.yale.edu/content.php?pid=8564&amp;sid=66405 |title=Selected Dictionaries and Encyclopedias for Theater |publisher=Yale University Library |accessdate=16 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621091137/http://guides.library.yale.edu/content.php?pid=8564&amp;sid=66405 |archivedate=21 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclopedia is over 18,000 pages in length and profusely illustrated with thousands of illustrations of which 700 are in the text, 1800 are out of the text, and there are 320 color plates. The first print run of 10,000 copies was followed by a reprint of 5,000 additional copies. Originally published in Rome by Casa Editrice Le Maschere, reprints were published by UNEDI.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Published in Rome by Unione Editoriale in 1966, the ''Enciclopedia dello spettacolo. Aggiornamento 1955-1965'' ("Encyclopedia of Performing Arts, Supplementary 1955-1965) is an update of the main set.  The Aggiornamento addresses developments and biographies.&lt;ref name="Yale" /&gt;

Published in Rome by Unione Editoriale in 1968, the ''Enciclopedia dello spettacolo. Indice-repertorio'' (Encyclopedia of Performing Arts. Index-Directory) is a title index of the 145,000 entries cited in the main set and the supplements.  It addresses author, genre and year of composition.&lt;ref name="Yale" /&gt;

==Personnel and management==
D'Amico conceived of the project and brought it to fruition.  The theater section was under the direction of [[Luigi Squarzina]]; he also did the film section.  D'Amico's father worked on the drama theatre section, while his brother Mario worked on the music section. [[Gabriele Baldini]] and later [[Gian Luigi Rondi]] were responsible for the cinema section. Additional sections were led by others including:  [[classical antiquity]] by [[Bruno Gentili]], German theater by [[Paolo Chiarini]], Slavic theater by [[Angelo Maria Ripellino]], English theater by Brunacci, French theater by [[Gian Carlo Roscioni]], Iberian theater by [[Luciana Stegagno Picchio]], and Italian theater by [[Niccolò Gallo]], [[Giulio Cesare Castello]], and [[Caesar Garboli]]. The [[Chamber music]] section was under the direction of D'Amico's son, [[Fedele D'Amico]], a [[Musicology|musicologist]], with [[Nino Pirrotta]], [[Franco Serpa]] and [[Emilia Zanetti]] as editors.

Consultants included [[Sabatino Moscati]] for Hebrew and [[Yiddish theater]]; [[Dario Puccini]] for the [[Iberian language]] theater; [[Luigi Salvini]] for Slavic, [[Finno-Ugric]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian language theater]]; [[Giuliano Bertuccioli]] for [[Chinese theater|Chinese language theater]]. Almost all of the drawings were made by young, recent graduates. Some of the illustrations were edited by [[Helen Poveledo]]. Texts and drafts were reviewed by professors.&lt;ref name="unile" /&gt;

==Critical and popular assessments==
Most libraries found it to be an essential component of their reference section.

The proposed biographies of many lesser figures were not included as the editorial staff were unable to keep up with the publisher's deadline.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt;

Criticisms of the encyclopedia have included the fact that it was only available in the Italian language, that it was [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]], and that non-European theater and 20th century theater were underrepresented. While the encyclopedia was first published in the 1950s, it was based on pre-[[World War II]] documentation. By the 1970s, the ''Encyclopedia of Performing Arts'' was considered out of date.&lt;ref name="Rubin" /&gt;

'''Fangirl''' is a 2013 contemporary [[young adult fiction|young adult novel]] written by [[Rainbow Rowell]]. ''Fangirl's'' publication follows Rowell's previous young adult novel, published earlier in 2013, ''[[Eleanor &amp; Park]]''.

==Plot==
Cath is a freshman at the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]], along with her much more outgoing identical twin sister Wren. But Cath is having a hard time adjusting to college. First, because Wren doesn't want to room with her, and second, because of her social anxiety disorder. A lot of Cath's free time is spent writing fan fiction for a book series about a boy magician named Simon Snow, and Cath has thousands of passionate followers who read her award-winning fan fiction based on a story similar to Harry Potter.
Wren distances herself from Cath as she enters college, professes to have outgrown fan fiction and Simon Snow, and goes out drinking and dancing with her roommate almost every night.  Meanwhile, Cath is more interested in her fiction-writing class. The professor is very impressed with her writing, and Cath finds a writing partner and friend in Nick, whom she meets with weekly for writing sessions. However, Cath suffers an emotional and academic setback when the professor gives Cath an F for writing a fan fiction story for a class assignment, as she considers this to be plagiarism.

Cath is, in general, miserable at school. She has no friends, has been emotionally abandoned by her identical twin sister, and gets panic attacks at the idea of eating at her dorm's dining hall so she subsists on a stash of energy bars she furtively eats in her room. She still suffers from the scars of her mother's abandonment when she was eight, and she is very worried about her father, who is bipolar and does not take care of himself. So her bold, outgoing roommate, Reagan, and friend Levi, decide to befriend Cath.  Cath becomes closer to Levi. It turns out Levi is not dating Reagan and is interested romantically in Cath, but when Cath seeks out Levi to let him know she reciprocates his feelings, she finds him in the arms of another woman. Then, Cath is betrayed by her writing partner, who was just using her to get a higher grade in the fiction-writing class. Just before finals, Cath's father has a bipolar psychological crisis and ends up being involuntarily committed to a mental facility for a short time, causing Cath to ditch her exams and her final paper for her fiction-writing class so she can travel home to Omaha and take care of her father.

Cath becomes very stressed and reaches a point of giving up on school, on Wren, and on the complicated relationships she has forged at school with Reagan, Nick, Levi, and her fiction-writing professor. However, she decides to continue and starts to learn to deal with her various problems. Meanwhile, Wren's problems surface in a shocking way. Cath and her sister reunite after Wren gets alcohol poisoning and ends up in the hospital, and while in the hospital waiting to see Wren, Cath sees her mother after years of abandonment. Nick's betrayal comes home to roost in a satisfying fashion as Wren, Reagan, and Levi defend Cath, and Levi is found to be much more than meets the eye. As the year comes to a close, Cath struggles to finish writing her fan fiction novel of two years, ''Carry On, Simon'', and to write her original short story (as well as a way of making peace with her mom's leaving her) for fiction-writing.

==Characters==

Note: Rowell has stated that most of the characters in the novel have names taken from buildings on the University of Nebraska&amp;mdash;Lincoln campus.

;Cather "Cath" Avery: The shy, introverted protagonist and eponymous "fangirl". Cath is an identical twin, describing herself as looking like her sister, only with long hair and glasses. Unlike her sister, Cath prefers to dress in clothes that say "up all night writing," rather than, "party at a boy's place." Cath is a very talented writer. Her main hobby is writing fanfiction about the fictitious ''Simon Snow'' series, particularly fanfiction between two male characters, Simon Snow and Baz Pitch.  In her family life, Cath is very close to her father. Her mother left the family a week after 9/11, when Cath and Wren were in the Third Grade. As a result, Cath has had to take more responsibility in the family, trying to fill some space that her mother left empty. Further, Cath is resentful of her mother and refuses to acknowledge her. Her relationship with her twin sister, Wren, preceding the book is good, however they begin to grow apart the during the school year. Wren specifically tells Cath she doesn't want to be roommates. Cath becomes friends with her roommate, Reagan, an upperclassman, and subsequently, Reagan's "boyfriend", Levi, whom she eventually dates. Another plot point is Cath's low self-esteem, which causes her to constantly berate herself and compare herself to Wren. Because of this, Cath has trouble believing that Levi actually likes her romantically. She keeps him and Wren separate because she thinks that if he gets to know her, he will like her better. She eventually decides to stay at the University of Nebraska, continue living with Reagan, and pursue a career in writing.

;Wren Avery: Cath's twin sister. Wren is the "awesome one", being more outgoing and extroverted than her sister. Cath admires her confidence and her ability to take things in stride. She is the less responsible of the two and cares more about fitting in and being a party girl than working hard and taking care of herself. Wren tells Cath that she does not want to be roommates at college because she wants to break free and have her own life. According to Cath, Wren has had lots of boyfriends, though she has not really cared for any of them. Wren is the one who decides to reconnect with their mother. She is also constantly annoyed at Cath for being overbearing and more like a mother. After she gets alcohol poisoning, she agrees to change, and is shown to party less and grows closer with Cath as a result. Cath is hesitant to let Wren hang around with Levi out of fear that he will get to know Wren and end up liking her better, which he practically laughs at. Wren is also an avid fan of the Simon Snow books like her sister.

;Levi Stewart: Cath's friend and, later, boyfriend. Levi is shown to be tall, blonde, and a farm boy. He was raised on a ranch in a small town in Nebraska and has four sisters. He studies Range Management at the Agricultural School and hopes to work on his family's ranch eventually. Cath describes him as a guy who is always smiling at everyone like it does not cost him anything. Levi is polite, smart, and an extrovert. Before the book, he and Regan were in a relationship, but it ended quickly once they started college when Reagan kept cheating on him. Although he has an incredibly retentive memory, Levi struggles with reading because the written words do not resonate with him like sounds do. Instead, he listens to lectures and books so that he can retain the information. Levi is shown to be incredibly faithful and loyal. He is the person who is most devoted to getting to know Cath and getting her out of her shell. (In her FAQ, Rainbow Rowell stated that Levi's surname was Stewart, a fact not mentioned in the book.)

;Reagan: Cath's roommate. She is described as an edgier version of [[Adele]]. Reagan is sarcastic, cynical, and often mean to Cath, but this is apparently her way of caring. She eventually takes Cath under her wing and becomes her friend. She dated Levi in high school, but they broke up when they got to college, and remain friends. She is on a scholarship and is required to live in residence.

;Arthur Avery: Cath and Wren's father. He is bipolar, but tries to be good parent to Cath and Wren. Arthur is shown to have crazy ideas, like building a fireman's pole to the washroom, etc., and is described as a marketing genius by his boss. He is left in a tough position after their mother leaves, but copes with the help of Cath and Wren. He has a psychotic break in the middle of the novel, one of several he has had in his lifetime, and is temporarily committed to a mental institution. Although he does need help to take care of himself, he puts his daughters' education above all else and does not want Cath to take care of him. He is also shown to be a very liberal parent, not making a big deal about who the girls bring home and letting them make their own decisions.

;Nick Manter: Cath's classmate and former writing partner. Cath describes him as looking like "someone with a steerage ticket on the ''Titanic''".&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, Rainbow. Fangirl. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, NY. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a talented writer but takes himself too seriously, not believing in love or wanting to write romance. Nick asks Cath to write together as a side project, but he ends up writing most of it himself and getting Cath to "fix" his writing by editing, writing dialogue, and changing details. Eventually Nick tells Cath that he is going to hand in their story as his final assignment for their class, telling her that he was really the writer and she just did the editing. Professor Piper, however, notices Cath's distinctive style in the writing. Nick eventually loses his teaching assistantship due to his plagiarism and cannot get the story published in the school journal because Cath will not allow him to put her down as the coauthor, a demand of Professor Piper.

;Professor Piper: Cath's Fiction-Writing professor. She is described as a small woman with long grey-streaked brown hair and high cheek bones. She is the person who most believes in Cath's talent, giving her a second chance to redeem herself by letting her take the semester to work on her final assignment. She is the one that makes Nick Manter ask Cath for permission to publish the short story that they wrote together. Professor Piper disapproves of fan fiction and while understanding that it is not plagiarism, criticizes it for being unoriginal.

;Alejandro "Jandro": Wren's boyfriend. Jandro is introduced at Muggsy's, where he punches another guy for making rude remarks at Wren and Cath. He is described as Mexican, tall and muscular and disapproving of Wren's drinking habits. He studies Agriculture and lives in the Farm House, the Agriculture fraternity.

;Courtney: Wren's party girl roommate. At the beginning of the novel they are shown to be really good friends, despite only having met over the summer. Wren later begins to resent Courtney because she is shallow and quite stupid.

;Laura: Cath and Wren's mother. Laura met Arthur while working at an advertising firm when she was quite young. She never planned on getting pregnant and was not pleased when she found out that she was having two. She left the girls on September 11, 2001 and promised that she would talk to them again, but never did. She tries to get in contact with the girls during the course of the novel and is only given a chance by Wren. Cather hates her mother for leaving them and does not approve of her lack of interest in their lives, and wants nothing to do with them. Laura named her daughters Cather and Wren because she wanted to name her daughter "Catherine" and did not want to change her choice of name when she found out that she was having two girls, not one.

;Abel: Abel is Cath's high school boyfriend. He breaks up with her when Cath is a few months into college. He tells her that their relationship was never real. He also tells her he met another girl, Katie, who he feels he has a "real" relationship with. He also lets Cath know that Katie got a higher score than Cath on the ACT exam.

;Girl with the Pink Ugg Boots: She lives across from Cath and Reagan's room and has a weird interest in Levi. She also has pink Uggs.

==Reception==
The critical reception to the book has been positive, noting in particular its realistic portrayal of fan culture. A reviewer for Tor.com calls it "true-to-geek-life" and notes that "Rowell understands something vital in her novel, and that is that fandom is so much more than escapism—it is, whether conscious or unconsciously—a way for folks to interact with their surroundings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/08/book-review-fangirl-rainbow-rowell | title=Finding Your Real Life OTP: Fangirl by Rainbow Rowell | work=Tor.com | date=13 August 2013 | accessdate=15 September 2013 | author=Nordling, Emily}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Entertainment Weekly'' gives Rowell credit for capturing both the universe of fan fiction and the inside of a young person's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20731298,00.html | title=Fangirl (2013) | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=4 September 2013 | accessdate=15 September 2013 | author=Brissey, Breia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Kirkus starred review calls the novel "absolutely captivating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/rainbow-rowell/fangirl-rowell/ | title=FANGIRL by Rainbow Rowell | work=Kirkus Reviews | date=26 June 2013 | accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Fangirl'' was chosen as the inaugural book for the Tumblr book club, a Tumblr representative noted its themes of loving books and creating art, its appeal to readers of all ages, and Rowell's existing fan base on the social media platform as reasons for the choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://shelf-life.ew.com/2013/09/11/tumblr-book-club-rainbow-rowell-fangirl/ | title=Tumblr chooses Rainbow Rowell's 'Fangirl' as first official book club selection | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=11 September 2013 | accessdate=15 September 2013 | author=Brissey, Breia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spinoff novel==
On October 6, 2015, Rowell published the novel [[Carry On (novel)|''Carry On'']], which is a standalone story about Simon Snow and Baz Pitch, the characters from the fictional novel series that Cather obsesses about. It is a love story starring the two, as they try to seamlessly glide from enemies to lovers, all while fighting an evil force threatening the destroy the magical world and has the same name as the novel-within-a-novel that Cath is writing in ''Fangirl''. However, it is a standalone novel.  It is Rowell's first fantasy.

Cather and Levi have a cameo in Rowell's novel ''Landline''.

}}

'''Faxlore''' is a sort of [[folklore]]: [[humor]]ous texts, [[folk poetry]], [[folk art]], and  [[urban legend]]s that are circulated, not by word of mouth, but by [[fax machine]].  '''Xeroxlore''' or '''photocopylore''' is similar material circulated by [[photocopying]]; compare [[samizdat]] in [[Soviet-bloc]] countries.

The first use of the term '''xeroxlore''' was in [[Michael J. Preston (professor of English)|Michael J. Preston]]'s essay ''Xerox-lore'', 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Photocopylore" is perhaps the most frequently encountered name for the phenomenon now, because of [[trademark]] concerns involving the [[Xerox]] Corporation.  The first use of this term came in ''A Dictionary of English Folklore'' by [[Jacqueline Simpson]] and [[Steve Roud]].&lt;ref&gt;(Oxford University Press: 2000; {{ISBN|0-19-860766-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Material circulated in faxlore==
Some faxlore is relatively harmless.  [[Cartoon]]s and [[joke]]s often circulate as faxlore, the poor graphic quality becoming worse with each new person who resends the joke to the next recipient. Because faxlore and xeroxlore is the (mis)appropriation of [[technology]] owned by the employer, much [[humour|humorous]] faxlore is mildly subversive of the workplace and its values.  Like [[email]] and [[chain letters]], office technology has given new life to various forms of practical jokes, [[urban legends]], and folklore.  The items are often office-related, such as spoof agenda for meetings, spurious descriptions of ridiculous training programs that all staff will allegedly be required to attend, and so on.  Names may be whited out and replaced with someone in the office, making it a joke on a particular person, or details may be altered making an item more topical.&lt;ref&gt;Michael, 1995; Dundes, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The semi-traditional lists of reasons "why a cucumber is better than a man" or "why a beer is better than a woman" often circulate as faxlore, as has the well known [[mock German]] variations of the "[[Blinkenlights]]" poster.  Another commonly circulated text contains [[ethnic humor]]; a typical version goes:

:Heaven is where the police are British, the lovers French, the mechanics German, the chefs Italian, and it is all organized by the Swiss.

:Hell is where the police are German, the lovers Swiss, the mechanics French, the chefs British, and it is all organized by the Italians.

Materials of this sort have existed from the beginnings of duplicating technologies.  [[World War II]] era [[blueprint]]s exist of drawings of female nudes with their body parts labeled as if they were the parts of airplanes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} With the widespread adoption of photocopying, amateur duplication of this sort of material became available to a much larger social base.  Cartoons and other amateur materials were distributed in the workplace, usually in violation of [[business management|managerial]] restrictions on the use of office supplies, and often in disregard of [[copyright]] law.&lt;ref name="Preston, 1996"&gt;Preston, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during the early 1990s, the widespread adoption of telecopiers made it possible to duplicate these materials remotely.  The use of a fax machine  to duplicate these materials also changed the emphases of their subjects; various alarms and urban legends were propagated to distant readers over the telephone lines.  This use of fax has been somewhat supplanted by [[email]] as that technology became more widely used and embedded in the culture; the sort of urban legends that once circulated by fax are now likely to appear as [[email hoax]]es.  Specific computer related alarms are the subject of [[virus hoax]]es; email makes forwarding of texts relatively easy, and the frightening nature of the revelation makes it seem important to pass along, despite any doubts the sender might have.&lt;ref name="Preston, 1996"/&gt;

==Faxlore and urban legends==
[[File:Mickey mouse acid warning.png|thumb|An early example of a distributed warning about tattoo stickers allegedly laced with drugs, collected by [[Jan Brunvand]] in his book ''The Choking Doberman'']]
Other sorts of faxlore have had more serious consequences.  A number of more notorious urban legends have circulated in faxlore. The notorious "[[Blue star tattoo legend|Blue Star]] [[LSD|Acid]]" [[hoax]] is one well known example.

The "lights out" hoax, which claimed that people who were driving in the dark with their headlights out might be gang members, and that those who flashed their headlights at these drivers might be marked for [[murder]] as part of a [[gang]] initiation, was another hoax that was widely circulated as faxlore.&lt;ref&gt;Bunch, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  The poor graphic quality of the frequently re-sent faxes, which often were made out to appear to have originated with the police department of a distant [[city]], only made these hoaxes seem more credible.&lt;ref&gt;Brunvand, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal aspects==
In the [[United States]], collections of supposedly sinister symbols have been circulated among [[school]] administrators and [[police department]]s; in the 1980s these symbols were frequently alleged to be "[[Satanism|Satanic]] symbols", and in the 1990s they were alleged to be "gang symbols".  [[politics|Political]] or [[religion|religious]] symbols, like the [[peace symbol]], the [[Star of David]], the [[Rosary]], the [[ankh]], or the [[pentagram]] were mingled with other cryptic or fanciful symbols in these faxed and recirculated sheets, and the entire collection was condemned.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

On the authority of these anonymous, hard to trace, and impossible to [[cross-examination|cross-examine]] sources, school administrators sometimes acted to ban the wearing of Stars of David and similar symbols of minority religions.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  Typically, no compiler or author is given for the collection of symbols, though frightening descriptions are often given about their "secret meaning."  A number of [[civil liberties]] [[lawsuit]]s were filed over actions taken by school administrators who took these anonymous sources seriously.&lt;ref&gt;''Chalifoux'', 1997; ''Jeglin'', 1993; ''Jewish News Weekly'', 1999; ''Free Republic'', 2005; Bunch, 1993; Roberts et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar claim that the [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] logo was a "[[Satanism|satanic symbol]]" was linked in the 1980s to the activity of several [[Amway]] distributors, Amway being one of Procter &amp; Gamble's competitors; the hoax was spread by fax, photocopier, and later by [[voice mail]] and email.&lt;ref&gt;Emery, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Another occasional hoax claims that clothing and memorabilia of various [[university|universities]] or [[sports]] teams are "gang symbols".&lt;ref&gt;''Jeglin'', 1993; Roberts et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growing obsolescence ==
With the rise of the [[Internet]], media such as [[World Wide Web]], [[email]], [[instant messaging]], and [[social networking sites]] are now available to quickly and widely spread the sort of material that formerly circulated as faxlore. The hoax warnings of things such as dire and terrible [[computer virus]]es that still occasionally circulate, carry on one tradition of the bogus [[cautionary tale]] that used to circulate as faxlore.

The '''Foundation for the Community of Artists''' was founded in 1971 as a support organization for working artists. By 1988 its membership had grown to nearly 6,000, including artists, art workers and representatives of art organizations. Although the majority lived in the New York metropolitan area, there were members located throughout the nation (there was at least one who lived in England). It remained active through the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;FCA archives, NY, NY&lt;/ref&gt;

FCA grew out of the National Art Workers Community (a splinter group of the [[Art Workers Coalition|Art Workers' Coalition]]). From its inception, the organization strove to overcome problems fundamental to the lives of artists. Its initial service was a four-issue-per-year publication, the ''Art Workers Newsletter'', which functioned as an open forum for the exchange of ideas and the dissemination of news items important to the trade. Its name later became ''[[Art Workers News and Art &amp; Artists|Art Workers News]]'' and, in the early 1980s, its scope was broadened and it became the bi-monthly publication, ''[[Art Workers News and Art &amp; Artists|Art &amp; Artists]]''. Over the years, articles by leading artists, critics and educators, as well as information relating to health hazards,&lt;ref&gt;Art ''Workers News/Art &amp; Artists,'' libraries worldwide, http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=art+workers+news&amp;qt=results_page&lt;/ref&gt; legal and financial affairs, housing employment and exhibition spaces, appeared in its pages.

== Mission, Services, Accomplishments ==

The Foundation sought to respond to artist needs of the time. Programs included a five-day-a-week hotline to help artists with housing problems in the downtown Manhattan loft community; sponsorship of part of the [[CETA Artists Project (NYC Cultural Council Foundation 1978-80)|CETA Artists Project]] in the late 1970s; Artwork, a job referral and placement agency; and two programs dealing with sexual and racial discrimination.

It offered its members a choice of several group health insurance programs, including Blue Cross/Blue Shield hospitalization/major medical coverage, and a health maintenance/hospitalization plan (HMO) through Healthways, Inc.

In addition to ''Art &amp; Artists'', FCA published a bi-monthly, eight-page newsletter, ''Artist Update'', which listed grants, competitions, resources and other opportunities, and books of particular concern to the working artist, such as the original editions of Dr. Michael McCann’s ''[http://www.lyonspress.com/book/9781599213187 Health Hazards Manual for Artists]'' and Caryn Leland’s ''[https://www.amazon.com/art-law-primer-Caryn-Leland/dp/093303203X The Art Law Primer]''.

The Foundation participated in a national consortium of arts groups that focused on issues of living and working space for artists. Computerized lists of available space were kept up to date for the cities of Minneapolis, MN; Washington, DC; Oakland and Berkeley, CA; and New York City.

FCA regularly ran seminars and workshops covering such issues as marketing and publicity, the gallery system, copyright and tax law, art research libraries, “hotline” phone numbers and bulletin boards, art material suppliers, consultants, etc. The organization also helped artists prepare resumes, apply for grants and work out project budgets.

Through the Foundation, members could join the first nationwide credit union for artists of all disciplines. The [http://www.as-ap.org/content/foundation-community-artists Artists’ Community Federal Credit Union], as it was called, offered savings accounts, automatic payment of health insurance premiums, financial counseling and personal loans from $100 to $5,000. Members were also eligible to apply for a Working Assets VISA, a “socially responsible” credit card.

Besides these services, the Foundation for the Community of Artists served as an artists' advocacy group. It took an aggressive stand on issues such as resale royalties legislation, the labeling of art materials, artists’ living and working space, and discrimination against minority and women artists. It provided public testimony, studies, publications and press reports through the New York Arts Coalition and the Alliance of New York State Art Councils. In early 1984, FCA helped initiate the cultural campaign Art Against Apartheid, which advocated for the freedom of South Africa. It provided office space and organizational support for AAA's local and national exhibitions and performances. Some of these efforts were documented in ''Ikon'' magazine’s ''Art Against Apartheid: Works for Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archives.worldlit.org/ikon-pdfs/IKON-5-6.pdf World Literature Today]'', University of Oklahoma, Norman, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==

FCA received funding from the [[New York State Council on the Arts]], the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and the Manhattan Borough President's Office, via the [[New York City Department of Cultural Affairs]]. Membership fees, newspaper subscriptions, the sale of other publications, and the administration of the health plans also generated income. The work of many volunteers along with individual and corporate donations helped keep the organization operational.

== Structure ==

The Foundation's general policies and mode of operation were determined by its fifteen-member, self-sustaining board, elected once a year, composed primarily of artists. There was a salaried Executive Director, who was responsible for administration of the policies of the board and the daily operation of the organization. There was also an advisory council with ten members, which included artists and specialists in areas of expertise appropriate to the Foundation's concerns.

The '''''gajasimha''''' or '''''gajasiha''''' (from {{lang-sa|gaja+siṃha|script=Latn}} / {{lang-pi|gaja+sīha|script=Latn}}) is a [[mythical hybrid]] animal in [[Hindu mythology]], appearing as a ''sinha'' or ''rajasiha'' (mythical lion) with the head or trunk of an elephant. It is found as a motif in Indian and Sinhalese art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bane |first1=Theresa |title=Encyclopedia of beasts and monsters in myth, legend and folklore |date=2016 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786495054 |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used as a heraldic symbol in some Southeast Asian countries, especially [[Cambodia]] and [[Thailand]]. In Siam (pre-modern Thailand), the ''gajasimha'' served as the symbol of the ''[[kalahom]]'', one of the king's two chief chancellors. It appears as a [[supporter]] in the [[coat of arms of Siam]], in use from 1873 to 1910, and the [[royal arms of Cambodia]], officially adopted in 1993.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3567">The '''Hornsleth Village Project''' was a controversial [[conceptual art]] project by [[Danish people|Danish]] artist [[Kristian von Hornsleth]] in which he went to the [[Uganda]]n village of Buteyongera and paid impoverished villagers to legally change their names to "Hornsleth". In exchange for consenting to have "Hornsleth" added to their identity documents, the villagers were given livestock. The project began in June 2006; in October 2006, [[Kampala]] officials put a stop to the project, citing ethical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200610270148.html Govt Blocks Mukono Pig Project] from ''[[The Monitor (Uganda)|The Monitor]]'', November 27, 2006; by Jude Luggya &amp; Agness Nandutu; archived at AllAfrica.com&lt;/ref&gt;

By that time, 270 newly renamed Hornsleths had each received a pig, and another 70 had each received a goat.

Hornsleth, who said that he would like it if the village's name were eventually changed as well,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6157612.stm Storm over 'pig-for-name' artist], [[BBC]], 17 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; described it as a straightforward business transaction, wherein he paid the villagers to participate in his project and pose for photographs.

The Ugandan Minister of Ethics, [[James Nsaba Buturo]], criticized Hornsleth as being a cult leader,&lt;ref name=Grauniad&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2006/nov/17/ugandansswapn The Hornsleths of Uganda], by Lars Eriksen, at ''[[the Guardian]]''; published November 17, 2006; retrieved October 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; obscene, mentally deranged, evil,&lt;ref name=Satanic&gt;[http://business.highbeam.com/3548/article-1G1-153425697/hornsleth-satanic-says-minister-buturo Hornsleth Satanic, Says Minister Buturo.], by Steven Candia, from [[AllAfrica.com]] (archived at [[HighBeam Research]]); published October 26, 2006; retrieved October 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; racist, and a homosexual,&lt;ref name=Grauniad/&gt; and the project as demeaning, and stated that official diplomatic measures would be taken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/532458 Hornsleth show angers govt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234248/http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/532458 |date=2007-09-27 }} at [[New Vision]], November 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nsaba Buturo also protested against Hornsleth's use of the Ugandan national flag and the [[grey crowned crane|crested crane]] (Uganda's national bird) on the invitation cards to Hornsleth's photo exhibition in Copenhagen, entitled "We Can Help You, But We Want To Own You".

By June 2008, "most" of the residents of Buteyongera had gone back to their original names,&lt;ref name=URN&gt;[https://ugandaradionetwork.com/story/memories-of-hornsleth-still-abound-in-buteyongera-village Memories of Hornsleth Still Abound in Buteyongera Village], by Hellen Ntegyereize, at Uganda Radio Network; published June 26, 2008; retrieved November 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2012, Hornsleth was cited by Ugandan law enforcement as an example of "foreign nationals" who have "ulterior, selfish motives".&lt;ref name=Suspicious&gt;[http://www.observer.ug/news-headlines/20453-suspicious-alien-arrested-in-nakasongola-barracks  Suspicious alien arrested in Nakasongola Barracks], by Benon Tugumisirize, at ''[[The Observer (Uganda)|The Observer]]''; published August 19, 2012; retrieved November 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ira Hamilton Hayes''' (January 12, 1923&amp;nbsp;– January 24, 1955) was a [[Pima people|Pima]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and a [[United States Marine]] who was one of the six flag raisers immortalized in the iconic photograph of the [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima|flag raising on Iwo Jima]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2006/0901/1156791312212.html |title = An Irishman's Diary |last = Ó'Riain |first = Seán |publisher = The Irish Times |date = 2006-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://hqinet001.hqmc.usmc.mil/HD/Historical/Whos_Who/Hayes_IH.htm |title = Corporal Ira Hamilton Hayes, USMCR |work = Who's Who in Marine Corps History |publisher = History Division, United States Marine Corps |accessdate = 2006-09-01 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061031191959/http://hqinet001.hqmc.usmc.mil/HD/Historical/Whos_Who/Hayes_IH.htm |archivedate = 2006-10-31 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes was an enrolled member of the [[Gila River Indian Community|Gila River Pima Indian Reservation]] located in the [[Pinal County|Pinal]] and [[Maricopa County|Maricopa]] counties in [[Arizona]]. He enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] on August 26, 1942 and, after recruit training, volunteered to become a [[Paramarine]]. He fought in the [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]] and [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] [[Military campaign|campaigns]] in the [[Pacific Theatre of Operations]].

On February 23, 1945, he helped to raise an American flag over [[Mount Suribachi]] on Iwo Jima, an event photographed by [[Joe Rosenthal]] of the [[Associated Press]]. Hayes and the other five flag-raisers became national heroes as a result. In 1946, he was instrumental in revealing the true identity of one of the other pictured Marines, who was killed in action on Iwo Jima. However, Hayes was never comfortable with his fame, and after his service in the Marine Corps, he descended into [[alcoholism]]. He died of exposure to cold and alcohol poisoning after a night of drinking on January 23–24, 1955. He was buried with [[Military funeral|full military honors]] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] on February 2, 1955.

Hayes was often commemorated in art and film, before and after his death. In 1949, he portrayed himself raising the flag in the motion picture movie, ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]''. A giant Marine figure of Hayes raising the flag on Iwo Jima with the other five participants is included on the 1954 [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]].

He was the subject of an article by journalist [[William Bradford Huie]], which was adapted for the feature film ''[[The Outsider (1961 film)|The Outsider]]'' (1961), starring [[Tony Curtis]] as Hayes. The movie inspired songwriter [[Peter La Farge]] to write "[[The Ballad of Ira Hayes]]," which became popular nationwide in 1964 after being recorded by [[Johnny Cash]]. In 2006, Hayes was portrayed by [[Adam Beach]] in the World War II movie ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]],'' directed by [[Clint Eastwood]].

==Early life==
Ira Hayes was born in [[Sacaton, Arizona]], a town in the [[Gila River Indian Community]] in [[Pinal County, Arizona|Pinal County]]. He was the eldest of six children born to Nancy Hamilton (1901–1972) and Joseph Hayes (1887–1978).&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 38"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley|Powers|2006|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hayes children were: Ira (1923–1955), Harold (1924–1925), Arlene (1926–1929), Leonard (1927–1952), Vernon (1929–1958), and Kenneth (born 1931).&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 38"/&gt; Joseph Hayes was a [[World War I]] veteran who supported his family by [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]] and its cotton harvesting.&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 39"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley|Powers|2006|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Hayes was a devout [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] and a [[Sunday school]] teacher at the [[Assemblies of God]] church in Sacaton.&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 39"/&gt;

Ira was remembered by his family and friends as being a shy and sensitive child. Sara Bernal, his first cousin, said, "Joseph Hayes was a very quiet man; he would go days without saying anything unless you spoke to him first. The other Hayes children would play and tease me, but not Ira. He was quiet, and somewhat distant. Ira didn't speak unless spoken to. He was just like his father."&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers pp. 39-41"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley|Powers|2006|pp=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; His boyhood friend Dana Norris said, "Even though I'm from the same culture, I could never get under his skin. Ira had the characteristic of not wanting to talk. But we Pimas are not prone to tooting our own horns. Ira was a quiet guy, such a quiet guy."&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers pp. 39-41"/&gt; Despite this, Hayes was a precocious child who displayed an impressive grasp of the [[English language]], a language that many Pima never learned to speak.&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 39"/&gt; He learned to read and write by the age of four and was a voracious reader.&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 39"/&gt;

In 1932, the family settled in [[Bapchule, Arizona]], approximately 12 miles northwest of Sacaton.&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 39"/&gt; The Hayes children attended grade school in Sacaton and high school at the Phoenix Indian School in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Hayes confided to his classmate Eleanor Pasquale after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], that he was determined to serve in the [[United States Marine Corps]].&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 41"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley|Powers|2006|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasquale said,  "Every morning in school, [the students] would get a report on [[World War II]]. We would sing the anthems of the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], and the [[United States Navy|Navy]]."&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers pp. 41-42"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley|Powers|2006|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes completed two years at the [[Phoenix Indian School]] and served in the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] in May and June 1942. He worked as a [[carpenter]] before enlisting in the service.&lt;ref name="California Indian Education: Ira Hayes: O'odham USMC Airborne Warrior"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiaindianeducation.org/native_american_veterans/ira_hayes.html|title=Ira Hayes: O’odham USMC Airborne Warrior|website=www.californiaindianeducation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayes enlisted in the [[Marine Corps Reserve]] on August 26, 1942.&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley|Powers|2006|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed recruit training in Platoon 701 at Marine Corps Base, San Diego (renamed in 1948, [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego]]) and in October volunteered for Marine [[paratrooper]] (Paramarine) training at the Marine Parachute School at [[Gillespie Field|Camp Gillespie]] located east of San Diego. He received the codename of ''Chief Falling Cloud''. On November 30, he graduated from the Parachute Training School and received his silver "[[Parachutist badge|jump wings]]".&lt;ref name="California Indian Education: Ira Hayes: O'odham USMC Airborne Warrior" /&gt; On December 1, he was promoted to [[Private first class|Private First Class]].&lt;ref name="Ira Hayes, Pima Marine" /&gt;

On December 2, 1942, he joined Company B, 3rd Parachute Battalion, Divisional Special Troops, [[3rd Marine Division]], at [[Camp Elliott]], [[California]]. On March 14, 1943, Hayes sailed for [[New Caledonia]] with the 3rd Parachute Battalion, which was assigned to Camp Kiser there on March 25 until September 26; the unit was redesignated in April as Company K, 3rd Parachute Battalion, 1st Marine Parachute Regiment&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. Airborne, Attached Units&amp;nbsp;— The U.S. Airborne during World War II, 1st Marine Parachute Regiment [http://www.ww2-airborne.us/units/1stmarine/1st_marine.html]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[I Marine Amphibious Corps]]. The 3rd battalion was shipped to [[Guadalcanal]] and remained there until it was sent to [[Vella Lavella]], arriving on October 14 for occupational duty. On December 4, Hayes landed with the 3rd battalion on Bougainville and fought against the [[Japan]]ese as a platoon [[automatic rifle]]man ([[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|BAR man]]) with Company K during the [[Bougainville Campaign]].&lt;ref name="Ira Hayes, Pima Marine" /&gt; The 3rd Parachute Battalion was shipped back to Guadalcanal, and he stayed there until sometime in February when the Paramarines were sent back to California. The 1st Parachute Regiment was officially disbanded at [[Camp Pendleton, California]], in February 1944.

Hayes was transferred to Company E, [[2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment]] of the newly activated [[5th Marine Division]] at Camp Pendleton. Hayes sailed to [[Hawaii]] with his company in September for continued training with the 5th division as it trained for the invasion and capture of Iwo Jima.

====Raising the flag on Iwo Jima====

[[File:Raising the Flag outline.svg|thumb|'''Hayes''' is pictured to the far left]]
The 5th Marine Division landed on [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] on February 19, 1945. Hayes's Second Platoon, Easy Company, 2/28 Marines, landed on the southern beach near Mount Suribachi off of the [[USS Talladega]] after transferring from the [[USS Missoula (APA-211)|USS Missoula]].&lt;ref name="Ira Hayes, Pima Marine" /&gt; On February 23, Marines from the Third Platoon of Easy Company, 2/28 Marines, captured and raised an American flag on top of Mount Suribachi at approximately 10:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.

In the early afternoon, Hayes's squad leader, Sergeant [[Michael Strank]], was ordered to take three Marines from his rifle squad in Second Platoon, Easy Company, to bring supplies up Mount Suribachi and raise a larger flag on the summit. Strank chose Corporal [[Harlon Block]], Private First Class [[Franklin Sousley]], and Hayes for the patrol. Marine Private First Class [[Rene Gagnon]], a battalion runner for Easy Company, was ordered up the mountain with the replacement flag. The four Marines together with Gagnon and Private First Class [[Harold Schultz]] (Navy corpsman [[John Bradley (Navy)|John Bradley]] was misidentified as a flag-raiser until June 23, 2016),&lt;ref name="marines.mil"&gt;[http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/ USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers], Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; raised the second flag attached onto another steel pipe found by Hayes and Sousley, while at the same time the smaller flag came down. Schultz from Third Platoon, was part of the original 40-man patrol that climbed up Mount Suribachi.

On March 14, another American flag was officially raised at Marine headquarters at the base of Mount Suribachi to signal the Marine occupied Iwo Jima, and the flag on top of Mount Suribachi that Hayes helped to raise there was taken down. Hayes fought on the island until it was secure on March 26, and left Iwo Jima with his unit on March 27. Easy Company had many casualties, Hayes was one of five Marines remaining from his platoon of forty-five men including their corpsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/specials/nativeamerican01/flag.html|title=American Indian Heritage Month: Iwo Jima Flag Raiser|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima|raising of the second American flag on Mount Suribachi]] on February 23, 1945 was immortalized by AP photographer [[Joe Rosenthal]] and became an icon of the world war. Soon afterwards, the two surviving flag-raisers Hayes and Gagnon, and Bradley who was believed to be in Rosenthal's photograph,&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt; became national heroes. Harlon Block who was killed in action on Iwo Jima in March 1945, was misidentified as being Sergeant [[Henry O. Hansen|Henry Hansen]] from Third Platoon, Easy Company who was also killed in action. Hayes had attempted to correct the misrepresentation of his friend Block for Hansen (Hansen helped raise the first flag) in April 1945, but was silenced by a Marine Corps officer in Washington, D.C. who was placed in charge of the flag-raisers.

====7th war bond selling tour====
[[File:Seventh-War-Loan-Drive-Poster-1945.jpg|right|thumb|140px|Seventh-War-Loan-Drive-Poster (May 11–July 4, 1945)]]
Hayes and his unit left Iwo Jima on the [[USS Winged Arrow]]&lt;ref name="Ira Hayes, Pima Marine" /&gt; bound for Hawaii on March 27, 1945. Hayes continued to train at Camp Tarawa again with his unit until April 15, 1945, when he boarded a plane to [[Washington, D.C.]] with orders to join C Company, 1st Headquarters Battalion, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps, Washington, D.C. with the two other surviving second flag-raisers. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin Roosevelt]] paid for the war by selling war bonds and had requested the flag raisers (in Joe Rosenthal's photograph) participation before he died on April 12. Hayes and Gagnon, and Bradley, were assigned to making public appearances in connection with selling government [[war bond]]s for the [[Series E bond|Seventh War Loan Drive]]. On April 20, the three met with [[Harry S. Truman|President Harry Truman]] at the [[White House]]. The bond tour began on May 11 in [[New York City]], after Hayes, Gagnon, and Bradley raised the same flag that was raised on Mount Suribachi, at the Nation's capital during a ceremony at the Capitol steps on May 9. Hayes was in charge of the flag. The bond tour ended on July 4 in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;The Mighty Seventh War Loan: {{cite web |url=http://www.bucknell.edu/x36352.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406193329/http://www.bucknell.edu/x36352.xml |archivedate=2013-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes however, finished his participation in the bond drive on May 24 in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] and returned to Washington, D.C. with orders to rejoin E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines at [[Camp Tarawa]] in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="Ira Hayes, Pima Marine" /&gt; He arrived at [[Hilo, Hawaii]] by plane and rejoined E Company on May 29.

On June 19, Hayes was promoted to corporal. He served on [[Occupation of Japan|occupation duty]] in Japan with E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines from September 22 to October 26, 1945. He was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton, California on December 1, 1945. On February 21, 1946, he was awarded a Navy Commendation from the Marine Corps for meritorious service in combat during World War II.

==Post World War II==
[[File:Hayes in LA.jpg|thumb|'''Ira Hayes''' (left) with Los Angeles mayor [[Fletcher Bowron]] (1947)]]
Hayes attempted to lead a normal civilian life after the war. "I kept getting hundreds of letters. And people would drive through the reservation, walk up to me and ask, "Are you the Indian who raised the flag on Iwo Jima?"&lt;ref name=Viola&gt;{{cite book|last = Viola| first = Herman J.| title = Warriors in Uniform: The Legacy of American Indian Heroism| url = https://books.google.com/?id=JYXMqa1MYNsC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=%22Are+you+the+Indian+who+raised+the+flag+on+Iwo+Jima%22&amp;q=%22Are%20you%20the%20Indian%20who%20raised%20the%20flag%20on%20Iwo%20Jima%22| date    = November 18, 2008| work    = [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]| isbn = 978-1-4262-0361-9| pages = 93–94| chapter = Fighting the Metal Hats: World War II| author2 = Campbell, Ben Nighthorse}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although Hayes rarely spoke about the flag raising, he talked more generally about his service in the Marine Corps with great pride.

Hayes seemed to be disturbed that Harlon Block was still being misrepresented publicly as "Hank" Hansen. One day in 1946, Hayes walked and hitchhiked 1,300 miles from the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona to Edward Frederick Block, Sr.'s farm in [[Weslaco, Texas]], to reveal the truth to Block's family about their son Harlon being in the Rosenthal photograph. He was instrumental in having the mistaken second flag-raiser controversy resolved by the Marine Corps in January 1947. Block's family was grateful to Hayes, especially Harlon's mother. She said that she had known from the time she first saw the photo in the newspaper, that it was Harlon in the photo. Mrs. Block took what Hayes said and wrote to her congressman.

[[File:USMC War Memorial Night.jpg|thumb|The [[USMC War Memorial|U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial]] in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Virginia]]]]
In 1949, Hayes appeared briefly as himself in the film ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]],'' starring [[John Wayne]]. In the movie, Wayne handed the American flag to Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley, who at the time were considered the three surviving second flag-raisers (the second flag that was raised on Mount Suribachi is used in the film and is handed directly to Gagnon).

After this Hayes was unable to hold on to a steady job for a long period, as he had become alcoholic. He was arrested 52 times for [[alcohol intoxication]] in public at various places in the country, including Chicago in October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=February 7, 1955 |title=Then There Were Two |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,823714,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to his [[alcoholism]], he once said: "I was sick. I guess I was about to crack up thinking about all my good buddies. They were better men than me and they're not coming back. Much less back to the [[White House]], like me."&lt;ref name=Viola/&gt; Hayes was sober while attending the [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] dedication on November 10, 1954 where he was lauded by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] as a hero. A reporter there approached Hayes and asked him, "How do you like the pomp and circumstance?" Hayes hung his head and said, "I don't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last      = Jeffers

His disquiet about his unwanted fame and his subsequent post-war problems were first recounted in detail by the author [[William Bradford Huie]] in "The Outsider," published in 1959 as part of his collection ''Wolf Whistle and Other Stories''. ''[[The Outsider (1961 film)|The Outsider]]'' was filmed in 1961, was directed by World War II veteran turned film director [[Delbert Mann]] and starred [[Tony Curtis]] as Hayes.&lt;ref name=imdbout&gt;{{IMDb title| id=55270 | title=The Outsider}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 film ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'', directed by [[Clint Eastwood]], suggests that Hayes suffered from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).

==Death==
[[File:Sacaton-Cook Memorial Church-1870-1.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Hayes's funeral was held in the C. H. Cook Memorial Church in Sacaton, Arizona]]
[[File:Ira Hayes Tombstone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hayes's headstone in [[Arlington, Virginia]]]]
On the morning of January 24, 1955, Hayes was found dead lying near an abandoned adobe hut near where he lived in Sacaton, Arizona. He had been drinking and playing cards on the reservation with his friends and brothers Vernon and Kenneth. An altercation ensued between Hayes and a Pima Indian named Henry Setoyant, and all left except Hayes and Setoyant. The Pinal County coroner concluded that Hayes's death was caused by [[hypothermia|exposure]] and [[alcohol poisoning]]. However, his  brother Kenneth, a [[Korean War]] veteran, believes that the death resulted from the altercation with Setoyant. The reservation police did not conduct an investigation into Hayes's death, and Setoyant denied any allegations of fighting with Hayes.&lt;ref name="Bradley-Powers p. 503"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley|Powers|2006|p=503}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no [[autopsy]].

In the film, ''The Outsider,'' his death is dramatized for the screen. He is shown drunk and freezing on a mountain top and unable to climb down. He falls asleep and is shown frozen to death with his arm and hand reaching upwards, like the time he raised the flag on Mount Suribachi. In the song "[[The Ballad of Ira Hayes]]," his death is described as dying an indigent death: being drunk and drowning in two inches of water in a ditch.

On February 2, 1955, Hayes was buried in Section 34, Grave 479A at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. At the funeral, fellow flag-raiser [[Rene Gagnon]] said of him: "Let's say he had a little dream in his heart that someday the Indian would be like the white man&amp;nbsp;— be able to walk all over the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chavers| first     = Dean| title     = Modern American Indian Leaders: Their Lives and Their Work| url  = https://books.google.com/?id=p1t0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=Let's+say+he+had+a+little+dream+in+his+heart+that+someday+the+Indian+would+be+like+the+white+man| volume    = 1

==1993 Marine Corps commemoration==
[[File:Sacaton-Ira Hayes Memorial.jpg|thumb|250px|The Ira H. Hayes Monument located in the Mathew B. Juan-Ira H. Hayes Veterans Memorial Park in Sacaton, Arizona]] 
On November 10, 1993, the [[United States Marine Corps]] held a ceremony at the Marine Corps War Memorial (Iwo Jima Memorial) commemorating the 218th anniversary of the Marine Corps. Of Ira Hayes, [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|USMC Commandant]] General [[Carl Epting Mundy, Jr.|Carl Mundy]] said:

{{quotation|One of the pairs of hands that you see outstretched to raise our National flag on the battle-scarred crest of Mount Suribachi so many years ago, are those of a Native American ... Ira Hayes ... a Marine not of the ethnic majority of our population.

Were Ira Hayes here today ... I would tell him that although my [[Carl Epting Mundy, Jr.#Remarks on minority officers|words on another occasion]] have given the impression that I believe some Marines ... because of their color ... are not as capable as other Marines ... that those were not the thoughts of my mind ... and that they are not the thoughts of my heart.

I would tell Ira Hayes that our Corps is what we are because we are of the people of America ... the people of the broad, strong, ethnic fabric that is our nation. And last, I would tell him that in the future, that fabric will broaden and strengthen in every category to make our Corps even stronger ... even of greater utility to our nation. That's a commitment of this commandant ... And that's a personal commitment of this Marine.}}

== Military awards ==
Hayes' Navy Commendation Ribbon was updated to the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with [[Combat "V"]] for meritorious service.&lt;ref&gt;The Combat Distinguishing Device (Combat "V") denotes he was "''exposed to personal hazard during direct participation in combat''" SECNAVINST 1650.1H.&lt;/ref&gt; He rates the [[Combat Action Ribbon|Navy Combat Action Ribbon]] for combat participation in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;The Combat Action Ribbon is a personal award, awarded by the Navy and Marine Corps, ''retroactive from December 7, 1941'': Public Law 106-65--October 5, 1999, 113 STAT 588, Sec 564&lt;/ref&gt; The {{frac|5|16}}" silver star on his Navy Presidential Unit Citation ribbon was a Marine Corps, World War II, campaign participation star (discontinued) for Iwo Jima, not a 2nd Presidential Unit Citation award ([[Service star|{{frac|3|16}}" bronze star]]). Hayes' 39 months of service did not meet the Marine Corps four-year (48 months) service requirement in World War II for the [[Good Conduct Medal (United States)|Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal]].

=== U.S. Marine Corps Commendation ===

{{quotation|&lt;center&gt;HEADQUARTERS&lt;br&gt;
FLEET MARINE FORCE, PACIFIC&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Commanding General, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, takes pleasure in COMMENDING, CORPORAL IRA H. HAYES, UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS, for service as set forth in the following

CITATION:

For meritorious and efficient performance of duty while serving with a Marine infantry battalion during operations against the enemy on VELLA LAVELLA AND BOUGAINVILLE, BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS, from 15 August to 15 December 1943, and on IWO JIMA, VOLCANO ISLANDS, from 19 February to 27 March 1945. Although often under heavy enemy fire, Corporal HAYES carried out his duties during all these campaigns in a highly commendable manner. Regardless of danger of personal fatigue he worked tirelessly, and his efforts greatly aided his unit in accomplishing its assigned missions. His courage, initiative, and loyal devotion to duty continually set an example for all who served with him, and his conduct throughout was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

[[File:John Flaxman by Musgrave Watson, University College London.jpg|thumb|John Flaxman by [[Musgrave Watson]], [[University College London]], 1847]]
'''John Flaxman''' [[Royal Academy of Arts|R.A.]] (6 July 1755 – 7 December 1826) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[sculpture|sculptor]] and [[drawing|draughtsman]], and a leading figure in British and European [[Neoclassicism]]. Early in his career he worked as a modeller for [[Josiah Wedgwood]]'s pottery. He spent several years in Rome, where he produced his first book illustrations. He was a prolific maker of funerary monuments.

==Early life and education==
He was born in [[York]].  His father, also named John (1726–1803), was well known as a moulder and seller of [[plaster cast]]s at the sign of the Golden Head, New Street, [[Covent Garden]], [[London]]. His wife's maiden name was Lee, and they had two children, William and John. Within six months of John's birth the family returned to London. He was a sickly child, high-shouldered, with a head too large for his body. His mother died when he was nine, and his father remarried. He had little schooling, and was largely self-educated. He took delight in drawing and modelling from his father's stock-in-trade, and studied translations from classical literature in an effort to understand them.&lt;ref name=eb1911&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Badger church - Jane and Henrietta Browne.jpg|thumb|Memorial in the church at [[Badger, Shropshire]]]]

His father's customers helped him with books, advice, and later with commissions. Particularly significant were the painter [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]], and a cultivated clergyman, [[Anthony Stephen Mathew]] and his wife [[Mrs. Mathew]], in whose house in Rathbone Place the young Flaxman used to meet the best "[[blue stocking|blue-stocking]]" society of the day and, among those his own age, the artists [[William Blake]] and [[Thomas Stothard]], who became his closest friends. At the age of 12 he won the first prize of the Society of Arts for a medallion, and exhibited in the gallery of the Free Society of Artists; at 15 he won a second prize from the Society of Arts showed at the [[Royal Academy]] for the first time. In the same year, 1770, he entered the Academy as a student and won the silver medal. In the competition for the gold medal of the Academy in 1772, however, Flaxman was defeated, the prize being awarded by the president, Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], to a competitor named Engleheart. This episode seemed to help cure Flaxman of a tendency to conceit which led [[Thomas Wedgwood V]] to say of him in 1775, "It is but a few years since he was a most supreme coxcomb."&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

He continued to work diligently, both as a student and as an exhibitor at the Academy, with occasional attempts at painting. To the Academy he contributed a wax model of [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]] (1770); four portrait models in wax (1771); a [[terracotta]] bust, a wax figure of a child, an historical figure (1772); a figure of ''Comedy''; and a relief of a Vestal (1773). During this period he received a commission from a friend of the Mathew family for a statue of [[Alexander the Great]], but he was unable to obtain a regular income from private contracts.

==Wedgwood==
From 1775 he was employed by the potter [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and his partner Bentley, for whom his father had also done some work,&lt;ref name=wedgwood/&gt; modelling reliefs for use on the company's [[jasperware]] and [[basaltware]].&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; The usual procedure was to model the reliefs in wax on slate or glass grounds before they cast for production.  D'Hancarville's engravings of Sir William Hamilton's collection of ancient Greek vases were an important influence on his work.&lt;ref name=wedgwood&gt;{{cite web|title=John Flaxman Jr (1755–1826)|publisher=The Wedgwood Museum|url=http://www.wedgwoodmuseum.org.uk/learning/discovery-packs/pack/classical/chapter/john-flaxman-jr-1755-1826|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His designs included the ''Apotheosis of Homer'' (1778), later used for a vase; ''Hercules in the Garden of Hesperides'' (1785); a large range of small bas-reliefs of which ''The Dancing Hours'' (1776-8) proved especially popular; library busts, portrait medallions, and a chess set.&lt;ref name=wedgwood/&gt;

==Early sculptural work==
By 1780 Flaxman had also begun to earn money by sculpting grave monuments. His early memorials included those to [[Thomas Chatterton]] in the church of [[St Mary Redcliffe]] in Bristol (1780), Mrs Morley in [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1784), and the Rev. Thomas and Mrs Margaret Ball in [[Chichester Cathedral]] (1785).. During the rest of Flaxman's career memorial [[bas-relief]]s of this type made up the bulk of his output, and are to be found in many churches throughout England.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; One example, the monument to [[George Steevens]], originally in [[St Matthais Old Church]], is now in the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46569 |title=Plate 14: The Church of St Matthias |author=Hermione Hobhouse (General Editor) |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |date=1994 |work=Survey of London: volumes 43 and 44: Poplar, Blackwall and Isle of Dogs |accessdate=28 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His best monumental work was admired for its pathos and simplicity, and for the combination of a truly Greek instinct for rhythmical design and composition with a spirit of domestic tenderness and innocence.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

== Marriage ==
[[File:Anne Flaxman (née Denman) by Henry Howard.jpg|thumb|left|Anne, Flaxman's wife, by [[Henry Howard (artist)|Henry Howard]], c. 1797]]
In 1782, aged 27, Flaxman married Anne Denman, who was to assist him throughout his career. She was well-educated, and a devoted companion. They set up house in [[Wardour Street]], and usually spent their summer holidays as guests of the poet [[William Hayley]], at Eartham in [[Sussex]].&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

==Italy==
In 1787, five years after their marriage,&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;  Flaxman and his wife set off for [[Rome]], on a journey partly funded by Wedgwood.&lt;ref name=wedgwood/&gt;  His activities in the city included supervising a group of modellers employed by Wedgwood, although he no longer made any work for the potter himself.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;  His sketchbooks show that while there he studied not only Classical, but also Medieval and [[Italian Renaissance art|Renaissance]] art.&lt;ref name=whin137&gt;Whinney 1971, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Rome he produced  the first of the book illustrations for which he was to become famous, and which promoted his influence all over Europe,&lt;ref name=whin137/&gt; leading [[Goethe]] to describe him as "the idol of all dilettanti".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/john-flaxman-186|title=John Flaxman 1755–1826|publisher=[[Tate Gallery]]|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His designs for the works of [[Homer]] (published in 1793)&lt;ref name=whin137/&gt; were commissioned by [[Georgiana Hare-Naylor]]; those for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] (first published in [[London]] in 1807) by Thomas Hope; those for [[Aeschylus]] by Lady Spencer. All were engraved by Piroli.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; Flaxman created one hundred and eleven illustrations to Dante's [[The Divine Comedy|Divine Comedy]] which served as an inspiration for such artists as [[Goya]] and [[Ingres]], and were used as an academic source for 19th-century art students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Flaxman's Illustrations for Dante's Divine Comedy|publisher= [[Dover Publications]]|location=Mineola N.Y|year=2007|chapter= Introduction|isbn= 0486455580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had originally intended to stay in Italy for little more than two years, but was detained by a commission for a marble group of the ''Fury of Athamas'' for [[Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol|Frederick Hervey]], [[Marquess of Bristol|Earl of Bristol]] and [[Bishop of Derry]],  which proved troublesome.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; By the time of his return to England in the summer of 1794, after an absence of seven years, he had also executed ''Cephalus and Aurora'', a group in marble based on a story in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. This was bought by [[Thomas Hope (1769-1831)|Thomas Hope]], who arrived in Rome in 1791, and is often said to have commissioned it. Hope was later to make it the centrepiece of a "Flaxman room" at his London home. It is now in the collection of the [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]], [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref name=lever&gt;{{cite web| title='Cephalus and Aurora', 1790|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ladylever/collections/sculpture/cephalusandaurora.aspx|publisher=[[Liverpool Museums]]|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to England==
During their homeward journey, the Flaxmans travelled through central and northern Italy. On their return they took a house in Buckingham Street, Fitzroy Square.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; Buckingham Street has since been renamed Greenwell Street, W1; there is a plaque to Flaxman on the front wall of no.7 identifying this as the site of the house where Flaxman lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plaquesoflondon.co.uk/page2477.htm|title=John Flaxman 1|website=www.plaquesoflondon.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after his return the sculptor published a protest against the scheme (already considered by the [[French Directory]] and carried out two years later by [[Napoleon]]) to set up a vast central museum of art at Paris to contain works looted from across Europe.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; Despite this, he later took take advantage of the [[Peace of Amiens]] to go to Paris to see the despoiled treasures collected there.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

While still in Rome, Flaxman had sent home models for several sepulchral monuments, including one in relief for the poet [[William Collins (poet)|William Collins]] in Chichester cathedral, and one in the round for [[Lord Mansfield]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

==Later life==

In 1797 he was made an associate of the [[Royal Academy]]. He exhibited work at the Academy annually, occasionally showing a public monument in the round, like those of [[Pasquale Paoli]] (1798) or Captain Montague (1802) for Westminster Abbey, of [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] for [[University College, Oxford]] (1797–1801),&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the''Victoria History of the Counties of England,'' Oxfordshire vol.III, p. 80., this monument had originally been intended for Calcutta.  University College has three other memorials by Flaxman: to [[Robert Chambers (English judge)|Sir Robert Chambers]], like Jones a Fellow of the College, judge and orientalist, [[Nathan Wetherell]], [[Master of University College, Oxford|Master]] 1764–1807, and Matthew Rolleston, Fellow of the College.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] or [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Howe]] for [[St Paul's Cathedral]], but more often memorials for churches, with symbolic Acts of Mercy or illustrations of biblical texts, usually in low relief.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;  He made a large number of these smaller funerary monuments; his work was in great demand, and he did not charge particularly high prices.&lt;ref name=whin137/&gt; Occasionally he would vary his output with a classical piece like those he favoured in his earlier years.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

Soon after his election as Associate of the Academy, he published a scheme for a grandiose monument to be erected on Greenwich Hill, in the form of a figure of [[Britannia]] {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}}  high, in honour of British naval victories.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

In 1800 he was elected a full Academician, and in 1810 the Academy appointed him to the specially created post of Professor of Sculpture. He was a thorough and judicious teacher, and his lectures were often reprinted. According to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' of 1911: "With many excellent observations, and with one singular merit — that of doing justice, as in those days justice was hardly ever done, to the sculpture of the medieval schools — these lectures lack point and felicity of expression, just as they are reported to have lacked fire in delivery, and are somewhat heavy reading."&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; His most important sculptural works from the years following this appointment were the monument to Mrs Baring in Micheldever church, the richest of all his monuments in relief (1805–1811); that for the Cooke-Yarborough family at [[Campsall]] church, [[Yorkshire]], those to Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] for St Paul's (1807); to Captain Webbe for India (1810); to Captains Walker and Beckett for Leeds (1811); to Lord Cornwallis for Prince of Wales's Island (1812); and to [[John Moore (general)|Sir John Moore]] for Glasgow (1813).&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

He was commissioned to create the monument to [[Matthew Boulton]] (died 1809), by Boulton's son, which is on the north wall of the [[sanctuary]] of [[St. Mary's Church, Handsworth]], [[Birmingham]], where Boulton is buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=(untitled)|date=2008-11-18|work=Birmingham Post|pages=1, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a marble bust of Boulton, set in a circular opening above two [[Putto|putti]], one holding an engraving of the [[Soho Manufactory]].

Around this time there was much debate over the merits of the sculptures from the Parthenon in Athens, which had been brought to Britain by Lord Elgin, and were hence popularly known as the [[Elgin marbles]].&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; When Flaxman first saw them at Elgin's house in 1807, he advised against their restoration.&lt;ref name=whin140&gt;Whinney 1971, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;  Flaxman's statements in favour of their purchase by the government to a parliamentary commission carried considerable weight; the sculptures were eventually bought in 1816.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; His designs for the friezes of ''Ancient Drama'' and ''Modern Drama'',  for the facade of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, made in 1809 and carved by [[John Charles Felix Rossi]], provide an early example of the direct influence of the marbles on British sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Whinney 1971, p. 140. The friezes survived the theatre's destruction by fire in 1856, and were reused on the present building.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years immediately following his Roman period he produced fewer outline designs for publication, except three for [[William Cowper]]'s translations of the [[Latin]] poems of [[John Milton]] (1810). In 1817, however, he returned to the genre, publishing a set of designs to [[Hesiod]], which were engraved by Blake. He also designed work for goldsmiths at around this time — a testimonial cup in honour of [[John Philip Kemble|John Kemble]],&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; and  the famous and beautiful (though quite un-[[Homer]]ic) "Shield of [[Achilles]]"&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; designed between 1810 and 1817 for [[Rundell and Bridge|Rundell, Bridge and Rundell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Shield of Achilles, 1821|url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?category=BHSILVER&amp;object=51266&amp;row=93&amp;detail=about|publisher=Royal Collection|accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other late works included  a frieze of ''Peace, Liberty and Plenty'', for the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]]'s sculpture gallery at [[Woburn Abbey]], and an heroic group of St Michael overthrowing Satan, for [[George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont|Lord Egremont]]'s [[Petworth House]]&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; (delivered after Flaxman's death.)&lt;ref name=whin144&gt;Whinney 1971, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote  several articles on art and archaeology for [[Rees's Cyclopædia|Rees's Encyclopaedia]] (1819–20).&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;
[[File:The south face of the Burdett Coutts memorial.jpg|thumb|Flaxman's name listed on the south face of the [[Burdett Coutts memorial]]]]

In 1820 Flaxman's wife died. Her younger sister, Maria Denman, and his own sister, Maria Flaxman, continued to live with him, and he continued to work hard. In 1822 he delivered at the Academy a lecture in memory of his old friend, [[Canova]], who had recently died; in 1823 he received a visit from [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|Schlegel]], who wrote an account of their meeting.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

Flaxman died, aged 71, on 7 December 1826.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; His name is listed as one of the important lost graves on the [[Burdett Coutts Memorial]] in [[Old St. Pancras]] Churchyard.

==Studio practice==
Most of the carving of his works was carried out by assistants; [[Margaret Whinney]] thought that, as a result "the execution of some of his marbles is a little dull" but that "his plaster models, cast from his own designs in clay, frequently show more sensitive handling".&lt;ref name=whin137/&gt; Early in his career, Flaxman made his works in the form of small models which his assistants would scale up when making the finished marble versions. In many cases, notably with the monument to Lord Howe, this proved problematic, and for his later works he produced full-sized plaster versions for his employees to work from.&lt;ref name=whin144/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Flaxman's complicated monuments in the round, such as the three in [[Westminster Abbey]] and the four in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], are considered too "heavy"; but his simple monuments in relief are of finer quality. He thoroughly understood relief, and it gave better scope for his particular talents. His compositions are best studied in the casts from his studio sketches, of which a comprehensive collection is preserved in the Flaxman gallery at [[University College, London]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/culture/projects/john-flaxman-gallery John Flaxman Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622194837/https://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums/uclart/collections/collections/flaxman |date=22 June 2011 }}, [[University College London]].&lt;/ref&gt; The principal public collections are at University College, in the [[British Museum]], and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

'''Kenneth Duva Burke''' (May 5, 1897 – November 19, 1993) was an American [[literary theory|literary theorist]], as well as poet, essayist, and novelist, who wrote on 20th-century [[philosophy]], [[aesthetics]], [[criticism]], and [[rhetoric|rhetorical theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Toye, ''Rhetoric: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As a literary theorist, Burke was best known for his analyses based on the nature of knowledge. Furthermore, he was one of the first individuals to stray away from more traditional [[rhetoric]] and view literature as "[[symbol|symbolic action]]."

Burke was unorthodox, concerning himself not only with literary texts, but with the elements of the text that interacted with the audience: social, historical, political background, author biography, etc.&lt;ref&gt;"Kenneth Burke." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/85395/Kenneth-Burke] Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his career, Burke has been praised by ''The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism'' as "one of the most unorthodox, challenging, and theoretically sophisticated American-born literary critics of the twentieth century." His work continues to be discussed by rhetoricians and philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;"Kenneth Burke." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.

==Personal history==
He was born on May 5 in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], and graduated from [[Peabody High School (Pennsylvania)|Peabody High School]], where his friend [[Malcolm Cowley]] was also a student. While he attended [[Ohio State University]] to pursue courses in French, German, Greek, and Latin, he later dropped out to move closer to New York City where he enrolled at Columbia University. During his time there, he was a member of the [[Boar's Head Society]].&lt;ref name=wolin&gt;

Edited by Bekah Shaia Dickstein, 2004. http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Burke__Kenneth.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greenwich Village]] he kept company with [[avant-garde]] writers such as [[Hart Crane]], [[Malcolm Cowley]], [[Gorham Munson]], and later [[Allen Tate]].&lt;ref&gt;Selzer, Jack. ''Kenneth Burke in Greenwich Village: Conversing with the Moderns, 1915–1931''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Raised by a Christian Science mother, Burke later became an avowed agnostic.

In 1919, he married Lily Mary Batterham, with whom he had three daughters: the late feminist, Marxist  anthropologist [[Eleanor Leacock]] (1922–1987); musician (Jeanne) Elspeth Chapin Hart (b. 1920); and writer and poet France Burke (b. ~1925). He would later marry her sister Elizabeth Batterham in 1933 and have two sons, Michael and Anthony. Burke served as the editor of the modernist literary magazine ''[[The Dial]]'' in 1923, and as its music critic from 1927-1929. Kenneth himself was an avid player of the piano. He received the [[The Dial#The Dial Award|Dial Award]] in 1928 for distinguished service to American literature. He was the music critic of ''[[The Nation]]'' from 1934–1936, and was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth Century Authors: A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Literature'', edited by [[Stanley Kunitz|Stanley J. Kunitz]] and Howard Haycraft, New York, The H. W. Wilson Company, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

His work on criticism was a driving force for placing him back into the university spotlight.  As a result, he was able to teach and lecture at various colleges, including [[Bennington College]], while continuing his literary work. Many of Kenneth Burke's personal papers and correspondence are housed at [[Pennsylvania State University]]'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20110807002118/http://www.libraries.psu.edu//psul/speccolls/rbm/burke.html Special Collections Library]. However, despite his stint lecturing at Universities, Burke was an [[autodidact]] and a self-taught scholar.&lt;ref&gt;"Letters from Kenneth Burke to William H. Rueckert, 1959-198", edited by William H. Rueckert, Indiana, Parlor Press LLC, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life, his New Jersey farm was a popular summer retreat for his extended family, as reported by his grandson [[Harry Chapin]], a contemporary popular song artist. He died of heart failure at his home in [[Andover, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADE099E1B49D55&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "KENNETH BURKE, 96 PHILOSOPHER, WRITER ON LANGUAGE"], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', November 22, 1993. Accessed July 16, 2008. "Kenneth Burke, a philosopher who was influential in American literary circles, has died. He was 96. Mr. Burke died Friday of heart failure at his home in Andover, N.J."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persuasions and influences==
Burke, like many twentieth century theorists and critics, was heavily influenced by the ideas of [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. He was a lifelong interpreter of [[Shakespeare]] and was also significantly influenced by [[Thorstein Veblen]]. He resisted being pigeonholed as a follower of any philosophical or political school of thought, and had a notable and very public break with the [[Marxism|Marxists]] who dominated the literary criticism set in the 1930s.

Burke corresponded with a number of literary critics, thinkers, and writers over the years, including [[William Carlos Williams]], [[Malcolm Cowley]], [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[Allen Tate]], [[Ralph Ellison]], [[Albert Murray (writer)|Albert Murray]], [[Katherine Anne Porter]], [[Jean Toomer]], [[Hart Crane]], and [[Marianne Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.psu.edu/content/dam/psul/up/speccolls/documents/Burke-1_Correspondents.pdf "List of Correspondents in Kenneth Burke Papers"], Kenneth Burke Papers, Special Collections Library, Pennsylvania State University.&lt;/ref&gt; Later thinkers who have acknowledged Burke's influence include [[Harold Bloom]], [[Stanley Cavell]], [[J. Hillis Miller]], [[Susan Sontag]] (his student at the University of Chicago), [[Erving Goffman]],&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, J. N. (1978). ''Social Exchange, Dramaturgy and Ethnomethodology: Toward a Paradigmatic Synthesis.'' New York: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Hartman]], [[Edward Said]], [[René Girard]], [[Fredric Jameson]], [[Michael Calvin McGee]], [[Dell Hymes]] and [[Clifford Geertz]]. Burke was one of the first prominent American critics to appreciate and articulate the importance of Thomas Mann and André Gide; Burke produced the first English translation of "Death in Venice", which first appeared in ''The Dial'' in 1924. It is now considered to be much more faithful and explicit than H. T. Lowe-Porter's more famous 1930 translation.

Burke's political engagement is evident—''A Grammar of Motives'' takes as its epigraph, ''ad bellum purificandum'' (toward the purification of war).

American literary critic Harold Bloom singled out Burke's ''Counterstatement'' and ''A Rhetoric of Motives'' for inclusion in his "Western Canon".

Beyond his contemporary influences, Burke took [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] teachings into account while developing his theories on rhetoric. A significant source of his ideas is Aristotle's ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]''. Drawing from this work, Burke oriented his writing about language specifically to its social context. Similarly, he studied language as involving more than logical discourse and grammatical structure because he recognized that the social context of language cannot be reduced to principles of pure reason.

Burke draws a line between a Platonic and a more contemporary view of rhetoric, described as "old rhetoric" and "new rhetoric" respectively. The former is defined by persuasion by any means, while the latter is concerned with "[[Identification in Burkean rhetoric|identification]]."  In Burke's use of the word identification he is describing the process by which the speaker associates herself/himself with certain groups, such as a target audience.  
His idea of "identification" is similar to ethos of classical rhetoric, but it also explains the use of logos and pathos in an effort to create a lasting impression on the auditors. This theory differs from ethos most significantly in Burke's conception of artistic communication that he believes is defined by eloquence, which is "simply the end of art and therefore its essence."  The use of rhetoric conveys aesthetic and social competence which is why a text can rarely be reduced to purely scientific or political implications, according to Burke. Rhetoric forms our social identity by a series of events usually based on linguistics, but more generally by the use of any symbolic figures.  He uses the metaphor of a drama to articulate this point, where interdependent characters speak and communicate with each other while allowing the others to do the same.  Also, Burke describes identification as a function of persuasive appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Gregory. [https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/2207/27%281%29+50-59.pdf?sequence=1 "Kenneth Burke's Rhetorical Theory within the Construction of the Enthnography of Speaking."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke defined [[rhetoric]] as the "use of words by human agents to form attitudes or to induce actions in other human agents." His definition builds on the preexisting ideas of how people understand the meaning of rhetoric. Burke describes rhetoric as using words to move people or encourage action.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Furthermore, he described rhetoric as being almost synonymous with persuasion (A Rhetoric of Motives, 1950). Burke argued that rhetoric works to bring about change in people. This change can be evident through attitude, motives or intentions as Burke stated but it can also be physical. Calling for help is an act of rhetoric. Rhetoric is symbolic action that calls people to physical action. Ultimately, rhetoric and persuasion become interchangeable words according to Burke. Other scholars have similar definitions of rhetoric. [[Aristotle]] argued that rhetoric was a tool for persuading people (but also for gaining information). He stated that rhetoric had the power to persuade people if the speaker knew how. One way in which Aristotle formed his arguments was through [[syllogism]]. Another example of how rhetoric was used to persuade was deliberate discourse. Here, politicians and lawyers used speech to pass or reject policies. [[Sally Miller Gearhart|Sally Gearhart]] states that rhetoric uses persuasion to induce change. Although she argues persuasion is violent and harmful, she uses it as a tool herself to bring about change.

==Philosophy==
The political and social power of ''symbols'' was central to Burke's scholarship throughout his career. He felt that through understanding "what is involved when we say what people are doing and why they are doing it", we could gain insight into the cognitive basis for our perception of the world. For Burke, the way in which we decide to narrate gives importance to specific qualities over others. He believed that this could tell us a great deal about how we see the world.

===Dramatism===
Burke called the social and political rhetorical analysis "[[dramatism]]" and believed that such an approach to language analysis and language usage could help us understand the basis of conflict, the virtues and dangers of cooperation, and the opportunities of identification and consubstantiality.

Burke defined the rhetorical function of language as "a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols."  His [[definition of humanity]] states that "man" is "the symbol using, making, and mis-using animal, inventor of the negative, separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making, goaded by the spirit of hierarchy, and rotten with perfection."&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "Definition of Man." ''The Hudson Review'' 16 4 (1963/1964): 491-514&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coe, Richard M. "Defining Rhetoric—and Us: A Meditation on Burke's Definition." ''Composition Theory for the Postmodern Classroom''. Eds. Olson, Gary A. and Sidney I. Dobrin. Albany: SUNY Press, 1994. 332-44.&lt;/ref&gt;  For Burke, some of the most significant problems in human behavior resulted from instances of symbols using human beings rather than human beings using symbols.

Burke proposed that when we attribute motives to others, we tend to rely on ratios between five elements: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. This has become known as the [[dramatistic pentad]].  The pentad is grounded in his dramatistic method, which considers human communication as a form of action. Dramatism "invites one to consider the matter of motives in a perspective that, being developed from the analysis of drama, treats language and thought primarily as modes of action" (Grammar of Motives xxii).  Burke pursued literary criticism not as a formalistic enterprise but rather as an enterprise with significant [[sociological criticism|sociological]] impact; he saw literature as "equipment for living," offering folk wisdom and common sense to people and thus guiding the way they lived their lives.

===Rebirth Cycle===
Through the use of dramatism, one can ultimately utilize Burke's Rebirth Cycle.  This cycle encompasses three distinct phases, which include: Guilt/Pollution, Purification, and Redemption.  Burke introduced the phases and their functionality through the use of a poem.  The poem follows, 
Here are the steps
In the Iron Law of History That welds Order and Sacrifice 
Order leads to Guilt
(For who can keep commandments!) Guilt needs Redemption
(for who would not be cleaned!) Redemption needs Redeemer (which is to say, a Victim!) 
Order
Through Guilt
To Victimage
(hence: Cult of the Kill)..." (p. 4-5) &lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. The Rhetoric of Religion. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Burke's poem provides a basis of for the interactions of the three phases. Order's introduction into the life of human enables the creation of guilt. In order to alleviate the results produced by the creation of Guilt, redemption is necessitated.  Through the abstraction of redemption, Burke leads to the completion of the cycle.

Pollution initially constitutes actions taken by an individual that result in the creation of Guilt.  The creation of Guilt occurs upon the rejection of a hierarchy. Challenges to relationships, changes in power, and appropriateness of behaviors to change are each contributing factors toward the formation of Guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Rybacki, Karyn &amp; Rybacki, Donald. Communication Criticism: Approaches and Genres. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing Company, 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is appropriate to draw parallels between the creation of Guilt, and the concept of original sin. Original sin constitutes "... an offense that cannot be avoided or a condition in which all people share".&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Sonja K., Foss, Karen A., and Trapp, Robert. Contemporary Perspectives on Rhetoric. Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press, Inc., 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt represents the initial action that strips a situation of its perceived purity. The establishment of Guilt necessarily leads to the need to undergo purification to cleanse the individual affected by its recognition.  Purification is thus accomplished through two forms of "ritual purification." Mortification and victimage represent the available avenues of purification

Stratification within society created by hierarchies allows for marginalization within societies.  Marginalization thus is a leading factor in the creation of Guilt, and leads to the need for mortification. Burke stated, "In an emphatic way, mortification is the exercising of oneself in 'virtue'; it is a systematic way of saying no to Disorder, or obediently saying yes to Order".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. The Rhetoric of Religion. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortification allows an individual's self-sacrifice which consequently enables them to rid themselves of impurities. Purification will only be reached, if it is equal to an individual's degree of guilt.  If mortification cannot be reached, individuals will ultimately be forced to project, "his conflict upon a scapegoat, by 'passing the buck,' by seeking a sacrificial vessel upon which he can vent, as from without, a turmoil that is actually within".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kennth. A Rhetoric of Motives. Berkley: University of California Press, 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrificial vessels allow for the extermination of an individual's Guilt while enabling them to remain virtuous. 
Victimage is the second form of ritual purification. Burke highlights society's need to rectify division within its ranks. He contended that "People so dislike the idea of division, their dislike can easily be turned against the man or group who would so much as name it, let alone proposing to act upon it".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth"The Rhetoric of Hitler's "Battle."" Readings in Rhetorical Criticism. Ed. Carl R. Burgchardt. State College: STRATA Publishing, Inc. 2010. 238-253.&lt;/ref&gt; Victimage allows for the creation of a scapegoat that serves as a depository of impurities in order to protect against entities that are alien to a particular society. The scapegoat takes on the sins of the impure, thus allowing redemption for the Guilty party.  Unfortunately, through the course of these actions the scape goat is harnessed with the sins of the Guilty.

Redemption is reached through one of two options. Tragic redemption revolves around the idea that guilt combines with the principles of perfection and substitution in order that victimage can be utilized. This can be viewed as the "guilty is removed from the rhetorical community through either scapegoating or mortification".&lt;ref&gt;Borchers, Timothy. Rhetorical Theory: An Introduction, Long Grove: Waveland Press, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Comic enlightenment is the second form of redemption.  This option allows the sins of the guilty to be adopted by Society as a whole, ultimately making Society guilty by association.

===Terministic screen===
Another key concept for Burke is the [[Terministic screens|Terministic screen]]—a ''set'' of symbols that becomes a kind of ''screen'' or grid of intelligibility through which the world makes sense to us.  Here Burke offers rhetorical theorists and critics a way of understanding the relationship between language and ideology.  Language, Burke thought, doesn't simply "reflect" reality; it also helps ''select'' reality as well as ''deflect'' reality. In ''Language as Symbolic Action'' (1966), he writes, "Even if any given terminology is a ''reflection'' of reality, by its very nature as a terminology it must be a ''selection'' of reality; and to this extent must function also as a ''deflection'' of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bizzell | last2 = Herzberg | title = The Rhetorical Tradition | edition = 2 | editors = Patricia Bizzell and Bruce Herzberg | pages = 1340–47 | accessdate = 2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Burke describes terministic screens as reflections of reality—we see these symbols as things that direct our attention to the topic at hand. For example, photos of the same object with different filters each direct the viewer's attention differently, much like how different subjects in academia grab the attention differently.  Burke states, "We must use terministic screens, since we can't say anything without the use of terms; whatever terms we use, they necessarily constitute a corresponding kind of screen; and any such screen necessarily directs the attention to one field rather than another." Burke drew not only from the works of Shakespeare and Sophocles, but from films and radio that were important to pop culture, because they were teeming with "symbolic and rhetorical ingredients." We as a people can be cued to accept the screen put in front of us, and mass culture such as TV and websites can be to blame for this. Media today has altered terministic screens, or as [[Richard Toye]] wrote in his book ''Rhetoric: A Very Short Introduction'',  the "linguistic filters which cause us to see situations in particular fashions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Killian, Justin |author2=Larson, Sean |author3=Emanuelle Wessels |title=Language as Symbolic Action|url=http://www.comm.umn.edu/burke/LASA.html|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toye|first=Richard|title=Rhetoric: A Very Short Introduction|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-19-965136-8|pages=71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principal works==
In "Definition of Man", the first essay of his collection ''Language as Symbolic Action'' (1966), Burke defined humankind as a "symbol using animal" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). This [[definition of man]], he argued, means that "reality" has actually "been built up for us through nothing but our symbol system" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). Without our encyclopedias, atlases, and other assorted reference guides, we would know little about the world that lies beyond our immediate sensory experience. What we call "reality," Burke stated, is actually a "clutter of symbols about the past combined with whatever things we know mainly through maps, magazines, newspapers, and the like about the present . . . a construct of our symbol systems" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). College students wandering from class to class, from English literature to sociology to biology to calculus, encounter a new reality each time they enter a classroom; the courses listed in a university's catalogue "are in effect but so many different terminologies" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). It stands to reason then that people who consider themselves to be Christian, and who internalize that religion's symbol system, inhabit a reality that is different from the one of practicing Buddhists, or Jews, or Muslims. The same would hold true for people who believe in the tenets of free market capitalism or socialism, Freudian psychoanalysis or Jungian depth psychology, as well as mysticism or materialism. Each belief system has its own vocabulary to describe how the world works and what things mean, thus presenting its adherents with a specific reality (no page reference).

Burke's poetry appears in four collections: ''Book of Moments'' (1955), ''Collected Poems 1915–1967'' (1968), the posthumously published ''The Late Poems: 1968-1993 Attitudinizings Verse-wise, While Fending for One's Selph, and in a Style Somewhat Artificially Colloquial'' (2005), and ''Here &amp; Elsewhere: The Collected Fiction of Kenneth Burke'' (2005).

The '''Letterist International''' ('''LI''') was a [[Paris]]-based collective of radical artists and theorists between 1952 and 1957. It was created by [[Guy Debord]] as a [[Wiktionary:schism|schism]] from [[Isidore Isou]]'s [[Lettrism|Letterist]] group. The group went on to join others in forming the [[Situationist International]], taking some key techniques and ideas with it.&lt;ref name="Kaufmann2011"&gt;Kaufmann, Vincent (2011) [http://www.institutfrancais.com/adpf-publi/folio/g_debord/ ''Guy Debord''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110723180331/http://www.institutfrancais.com/adpf-publi/folio/g_debord/ |date=23 July 2011 }} for the ''[[Institut français]]''. English translation ''[http://www.institutfrancais.com/adpf-publi/folio/textes/debord-eng.rtf Guy Debord]{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}'' by Martin Richet&lt;/ref&gt;

The spelling 'Lettrist' is also common in English, but 'Letterist' was the form the French group (''Internationale Lettriste'') themselves preferred, and used in their 1955 sticker: 'If you believe you have genius, or if you think you have only a brilliant intelligence, write the letterist internationale.' With regard to that second word, however, most scholars prefer 'International' to 'Internationale'.{{citation needed|reason=source f quote?|date=July 2016}} Such authors and translators as [[Donald Nicholson-Smith]], [[Simon Ford]], Sadie Plant and Andrew Hussey all agree on the 'Letterist International' spelling.

The group was a motley assortment of novelists, [[sound poetry|sound poets]], painters, film-makers, revolutionaries, bohemians, alcoholics, petty criminals, lunatics, under-age girls and self-proclaimed failures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} In the Summer of 1953, their average age was a mere twenty years old, rising to twenty nine and a half in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;''Internationale situationniste'', no. 2, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; In their blend of intellectualism, protest and hedonism—though differing in other ways, for instance in their total rejection of spirituality—they might be viewed as French counterparts of the American [[Beat Generation]], particularly in the form it took during exactly the same period, i.e. before anyone from either group achieved any real fame, and were still having the adventures that would inform their later works and ideas.

==History and theory==
The LI was the first breakaway faction from [[Isidore Isou]]'s [[Lettrism|Letterists]]. (They would be followed in turn by the [[Ultra-Lettrists|Ultra-Letterists]]). The schism developed when the 'left-wing' of the Letterist group disrupted a [[Charlie Chaplin]] press conference for ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]] in October 1952. They distributed a [[polemic]] entitled "No More Flat Feet", which concluded: "The footlights have melted the make-up of the supposedly brilliant mime. All we can see now is a lugubrious and mercenary old man. Go home Mister Chaplin." Isou was keen to distance himself from his younger acolytes' tract. His own attitude was that Chaplin deserved respect as one of the great creators of the cinematic art. The breakaway group felt that he was no longer relevant, and they turned Isou's own words back against him: "We appreciated the importance of Chaplin's work ''in its own time'', but we know that today novelty lies elsewhere, and 'truths which no longer entertain become lies' (Isou)." As they proceeded to explain, "the most urgent exercise of liberty is the destruction of idols".&lt;ref&gt;''Internationale lettriste'', no. 1, emphasis in original.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the LI had in fact already been covertly formed by [[Guy Debord]] and [[Gil J. Wolman]] in June 1952, even before the Chaplin intervention and the public split from Isou, it was not formally established until 7 December 1952. The four signatories of the Chaplin tract (Debord and Wolman, together with [[Jean-Louis Brau]] and [[Serge Berna]]) agreed on a constitution for the group during a visit to [[Aubervilliers]] (where Brau's father lived). Anyone collaborating with 'Isouian activities', they declared, would be automatically excluded, even if this was being done in defence of the LI. 'It is in the transcendence of arts that everything has yet to be done.'&lt;ref&gt;Mension, ''The Tribe'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The official base of the group was at 32, Rue de la Montagne-Sainte-Geneviéve, [[Paris]], subsequently to become the official base of the Situationist International (but invariably referred to by both groups as "Rue de la Montagne-Geneviéve", signalling their disdain for religion). This was in fact the address of a bar, Tonneau d'Or, and indeed most of their time was spent either drinking in a number of bars in [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés]], principally at Chez Moineau on the Rue du Four, or else simply walking the streets.

There was a serious purpose behind their ambulation. They developed the '''[[dérive]]''', or drift, where they would wander like clouds through the urban environment for hours or sometimes even days on end. During their wanderings in the Summer of 1953, an "illiterate [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]]" suggested to them the term "[[Psychogeography]]", to designate what they saw as a pattern of emotive force-fields that would permeate a city. The dérive would enable them to map out these forces, and these results could then be used as a basis upon which to build a system of [[unitary urbanism]]. Among their most important texts on these matters were Debord's "Theory of the Dérive" (published in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[surrealist]] magazine ''[[Les Lèvres Nues]]'', no. 9, November 1956), and [[Ivan Chtcheglov]]'s "Formulary for a New Urbanism" (written October 1953, but not published until June 1958 in the first issue of the journal ''[[Situationist International|Internationale Situationniste]]''). In the latter, Chtcheglov advocated a new city where, as he wrote, "each person will live in his own personal 'cathedral'. There will be rooms that produce dreams better than drugs, and houses where it will be impossible to do anything but love." He declared, "[[The Haçienda|The Hacienda]] must be built", a remark which would later inspire the name of the famous [[Manchester]] night-club. In "Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography" (''[[Les Lèvres Nues]]'', no. 6, September 1955), Debord described a colleague's drift through the [[Harz]] region of [[Germany]], blindly following a map of [[London]]. This is still a favourite methodology amongst [[psychogeographers]]. They produced a broad range of proposals: the abolition of museums and the placing of art in bars, keeping the [[rapid transit|Metro]] open all night, opening the roofs of Paris like pavements with escalators to help gain access.

Another important notion developed by the LI, was that of '''[[détournement]]''', a technique of reutilising plagiarised material (literary, artistic, cinematic, etc.) for a new and usually radical purpose. The defining LI text here was the 1956 "A User's Guide to Détournement", by Debord and Wolman, from ''Les Lèvres Nues'' no. 8. They argued: "In truth, it is necessary to do away with the whole notion of personal property in this area. The emergence of new demands renders earlier 'great works' obsolete. They become obstacles, bad habits. It is not a question of whether we like them or not. We must pass them by."&lt;ref name="nues8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sami.is.free.fr/Oeuvres/debord_wolman_mode_emploi_detournement.html |title=Mode d'emploi du détournement |last1=Debord |first1=Guy-Ernest |last2=Wolman |first2=Gil J. |date=May 1956 |language=French |publisher=biblioteque-virtuelle |quote=A vrai dire, il faut en finir avec toute notion de propriété personnelle en cette matière. Le surgissement d'autres nécessités rend caduques les réalisations 'géniales' précédentes. Elles deviennent des obstacles, de redoutables habitudes. La question n'est pas de savoir si nous sommes ou non portés à les aimer. Nous devons passer outre. |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques were subsequently used extensively by the Situationists. In addition, such characteristically situationist concepts as the construction of situations and the supersession of art were first developed by the LI.

In addition to the central Parisian group, an [[Algeria]]n section of the LI was established in April 1953 by Hadj Mohamed Dahou, Cheik Ben Dhine and Ait Diafer. Based at [[Chlef|Orléansville]] ('the most letterist city in the world' according to ''Potlatch'' no. 12), they were hit hard by an earthquake there on 9 September 1954, although initial reports that most of them had been killed turned out to be unfounded (''Potlatch'' no. 13). A [[Switzerland|Swiss]] section was also established in late 1954, but were almost immediately excluded (''Potlatch'' no. 15).

In September 1956, Wolman represented the LI at the [[World Congress of Artists]] in [[Alba Docilia|Alba]], [[Italy]]. This conference had been organised by [[Asger Jorn]] and [[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio|Pinot-Gallizio]] of the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]] (IMIB), and important links between the two groups were consolidated. Wolman himself was excluded from the LI shortly afterwards, but the remaining members, Debord and [[Michèle Bernstein]], subsequently visited [[Cosio d'Arroscia]] where, on 28 July 1957, the LI officially fused with the IMIB and the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] to form the Situationist International.

==Adventures==
Besides the Charlie Chaplin protest, some of the more noteworthy/startling activities of the LI include:

* Ivan Chtcheglov's plan to blow up the [[Eiffel Tower]], on no other grounds than that its lights were shining through his bedroom window and keeping him awake at night. He was subsequently confined to a mental institution.
* Debord's legendary 1953 graffito, "Ne travaillez jamais!" ("Never work!"), inscribed on a wall at the corner of the Rue de Mazarine and Rue de Seine. The slogan would later reappear in May 1968, and summed up the ethos of both the LI and the Situationist International after them.

Although pre-dating the formation of the LI (but directly involving Serge Berna, and inspiring the others), one might also mention:

* A 1950 letterist attempt at the liberation of a Catholic orphanage at [[Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy|Auteuil]], causing a small-scale riot in protest at how "youth suffers in slavery, or is super-exploited by the seniority system."
* The [[Notre-Dame Affair]] of Easter Sunday, 1950, where [[Michel Mourre]], dressed in a Dominican's habit, took to the pulpit and began to address the congregation, informing them, before anyone realised that anything was amiss, that God was dead, and that the Catholic Church was "appropriating our life force in the name of an empty heaven", and "infecting the world with its morality of death".

An extract from a letter of Gil Wolman to Jean-Louis Brau, of 20 July 1953, gives a clear impression of what the group and their associates tended to get up to from day to day:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am back! ... Where were things when you left? Joël [Berlé] has been out for a long time, on probation. Jean-Michel [Mension] and Fred [Auguste Hommel]  are now free, too (for stealing from parked cars—and under the influence, naturally). Little Eliane [Papaï] got out of police custody last week after a dramatic arrest in a maid's room somewhere in Vincennes with Joël and Jean-Michel; they were drunk, needless to say, and refused to open up to the police, who left and came back with reinforcements. In the confusion they lost the seal of the Letterist International. Linda [Fried] not sentenced yet. Sarah [Abouaf] still in the reformatory—but her sister, sixteen and a half, has taken her place. There have been other arrests, for narcotics, for who knows what else. It's getting very tiresome. There is G[uy]-E[rnest Debord], who has just spent ten days in a nursing home where his parents sent him following a failed attempt to gas himself. He's back in the neighbourhood now. Serge [Berna?] is due out on 12 May. The day before yesterday I threw up royally outside Moineau's. The latest diversion in the neighbourhood is spending the night in the [[Catacombs of Paris|Catacombs]]—another of Joël's bright ideas. I have a good many projects which are liable to remain just that—projects. ...&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Mension, ''The Tribe'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Decades later, Debord would nostalgically (though also somewhat ambiguously) sum up the spirit of the times in his ''[[Panegyric]]'' (1989): "Between the rue du Four and the rue de Buci, where our youth so completely went astray as a few glasses were drunk, one could feel certain that we would never do any better."

==Membership==
* [[Guy Debord]] (1931–1994) (generally using the name 'Guy-Ernest' during this period).
* [[Gil J. Wolman]] (1929–1995). Excluded 1957.
* [[Michèle Bernstein]] (1932–). Joined 1954.
* [[Alexander Trocchi]] (1925–1984). Joined 1955.
* [[Hadj Mohamed Dahou]] Joined 1953.
* [[Ivan Chtcheglov]] (1933–98) (known as "Gilles Ivain"). Excluded 1954.
* [[Serge Berna]] (1925?–?). Excluded 1953.
* [[Patrick Straram]] (1934–84). Joined 1953, quit 1954.
* [[Jean-Michel Mension]]. (1934–2006). Excluded 1954.
* [[Jean-Louis Brau]] (1930–?) (known as "Bull Dog Brau"). Excluded 1953.

Several others also passed through the LI during its five years of existence, including André-Frank Conord, Jacques Fillon, Abdelhafid Khatib, Henry de Béarn and Gaëtan M. Langlais. In addition, the central members (almost all of them men), would sometimes include their girlfriends' names (usually first names only) among the signatories to their texts. Worthy of special mention among these girlfriends is [[Eliane Papaï]] (1935–?). An alumna of the same Auteuil orphanage the letterists had attempted to liberate, she was first the girlfriend of Debord, then the wife of Mension, and finally the wife of Brau. Debord recalled her fondly in many of his later films and writings, and she herself (as [[Eliane Brau]]) produced a book on the Situationists in 1968, ''Le situationnisme ou la nouvelle internationale''.

Jean-Louis Brau, Gil Wolman and [[François Dufrêne]] founded a Second Letterist International (''D.I.L.'', ''Deuxième Internationale Lettriste'') in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Figures de la négation'' ([[Musée D'Art Moderne, Saint-Etienne Métropole]], 2004), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Lettrist International]] was founded more recently and is independent of (though inspired by) the earlier group.

==Publications==
The LI published four issues of the ''[[Internationale Lettriste]]'' bulletin between 1952 and 1954, followed by twenty eight issues of ''[[Potlatch]]'' from 1954 to 1957. A further two issues of ''Potlatch'' appeared in November 1957 and July 1959, now with the revised subtitle "Information bulletin of the Situationist International". Each issue comprised between one and four [[mimeograph]]ed sheets. ''[[Les Lèvres Nues]]'', though not an LI publication, published some of their most important articles. All of these texts, together with a few other miscellaneous tracts, are reprinted in ''Documents Relatifs A La Fondation De L'Internationale Situationniste'' (Editions Allia, 1985).

Debord's 1959 collaboration with Asger Jorn, ''Mémoires'', was directly concerned with the early days of the LI. The new Gallimard edition of his ''Oeuvres'' gathers many LI texts, including some never before published. Michèle Bernstein's novels, ''Tous les chevaux du roi'' (1960) and ''La Nuit'' (1961), present fictionalised accounts of her life with Debord during this period. Patrick Straram's ''Les bouteilles se couchent'' was a semi-fictionalised contemporary account of the scene, written in 1953 but lost until recently: it was published by Editions Allia in 2006. Also recently published by the same house are a biography of Ivan Chtcheglov and a separate collection of his writings. In October 2010, an unpublished text from the LI has just been released that recalls the adventures of the letterists between 1945 and February 1953 : ''Visages de l'avant-garde'' (Paris: Jean-Paul Rocher, éditeur, 2010).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11840">''For audio examples, please see the article on [[Organ stop#Classifications of stops|organ stops]].''

An '''[[organ stop]]''' can mean one of three things:

*the control on an [[organ (music)|organ]] console that selects a particular sound
*the row of [[organ pipe]]s used to create a particular sound, more appropriately known as a ''rank''
*the sound itself

Organ stops are sorted into four major types: [[principal pipe|principal]], [[string pipe|string]], [[reed pipe|reed]], and [[flute pipe|flute]].

This is a [[Help:Sorting|sortable]] list of names that may be found associated with [[Electronic organ|electronic]] and [[pipe organ]] stops. Countless stops have been designed over the centuries, and individual organs may have stops, or names of stops, used nowhere else. This non-comprehensive list deals mainly with names of stops found on numerous [[Baroque]], classical and romantic organs. Here are a few of the most common ones:

{| class="sortable wikitable" style="margins:auto; width=95%;"
!width="150"| Stop name
!width="150"| Alternate name
!width="100"| Type
!width=| Notes
|-valign="top"
| Aeoline || Aéoline &lt;br /&gt; Éolienne
| String || an extremely small scaled stop with a very delicate, airy tone; built frequently as a single-rank stop, or as a double-rank celeste.
|-valign="top"

|-valign="top"
| [[Bourdon (organ pipe)|Bourdon]] || 
| Flute || a wide-scaled stopped-flute, 16&amp;prime; or 8&amp;prime; on the manuals, and 16&amp;prime; or 32&amp;prime; in the pedals (where it may be called ''Subbass'' or ''Contra Bourdon'')
|-valign="top"

The '''Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra''' ({{lang-lb|Lëtzebuerger philharmoneschen Orchester}}, {{lang-fr|Orchestre philharmonique du Luxembourg}}), abbreviated to '''OPL''', is a symphony [[orchestra]] based in [[Luxembourg City]], [[Luxembourg]].  The orchestra formerly performed at the [[Grand Théâtre de Luxembourg|Grand Théâtre de la Ville de Luxembourg]] and the [[Conservatoire de Luxembourg]].  Its current home is the [[Philharmonie Luxembourg]], a large [[concert hall]] opened in 2005 in the [[Kirchberg, Luxembourg|Kirchberg]] [[Quarters of Luxembourg City|quarter]] in the northeast of the city.

The orchestra was founded in 1933 as the in-house orchestra of [[RTL Radio]], named the ''RTL Grand Symphony Orchestra'' ({{lang-fr|Grand orchestre symphonique de RTL}}); [[Henri Pensis]] was its founder and first music director. After his initial tenure from 1933 to 1939, Pensis went into exile in the USA in the wake of [[World War II]].  He returned to Luxembourg in 1946 to resume direction of the orchestra.  After Pensis died in 1958, [[Carl Melles]] was the orchestra's music director in 1958.  [[Louis de Froment]] subsequently became music director and held the post from 1958 to 1980.  [[Leopold Hager]] succeeded de Froment in 1981, and served for 15 years to 1996.

Following the 1991 privatisation of the ''Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Radiodiffusion'', in 1995, RTL decided not to renew its contract with the orchestra.  Subsequently, the Luxembourg government established the Henri Pensis Foundation to allow for the orchestra to continue its existence.  In 1996, the orchestra acquired its current name under its new auspices.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite news|author=James C.

==Characters==
From Juan Galit, the other characters in the novel were Kabesang Leon (also known as Kapitan Leon, meaning Captain Leon, literally "Captain Lion", "Lion, the Head", or "Lion, the Leader"), Mauro, Luisa, Daniel, Nieves, and Pendoy.  Mauro is a painter and a poet.  Mauro is in love with Luisa, however Luisa’s parents has a dislike for Mauro.  Daniel, on the other hand, is in love with Nieves.  Nieves is the daughter of a wealthy father.  Pendoy is a character that was obsessed with Luisa and Nieves, thus wanted to ruin the relationships between Mauro and Luisa, and between Daniel and Nieves.  Pendoy, apart from the parents of Luisa and Nieves, became one of the obstacles affecting the relationships in the story.&lt;ref name=Filipiniana/&gt;

==Description==
Madaling Araw was written by Regalado when he 18 years old.  According to literary critic [[Soledad Reyes]], ''Madaling Araw'' was a complex and expansive novel that tackled issues that were personal to the author, as well as socio-political topics.&lt;ref name=Filipiniana/&gt; In ''Madaling Araw'', Regalado utilized the use of meanings or definitions to suppress the ills of Philippine society.&lt;ref name=ADMUP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Varsitarian/&gt; Regalado used Juan Galit as a tool for this technique of usage of meanings.&lt;ref name=Varsitarian/&gt; Beyond the romantic theme, Madaling Araw embarked upon the topics of poverty and other socio-economic conditions in the Philippines. Juan Galit (the name literally means "John [the] Angry") became the representation of the avenger for the poor and bringer of justice.  The poor had been exploited by Kabesang Leon, by an uncle of Mauro, and by other foreign capitalists residing in the country.  At the end of ''Madaling Araw'', Galit is seen as an advocate of bloodshed and a preacher of [[anarchy]],&lt;ref name=ADMUP/&gt; emphasizing to the Filipino people that bloodshed is important in the struggle for justice, because it was the only way for society to be able to cleanse and then reestablish itself.&lt;ref name=Filipiniana/&gt; This also emphasized that anarchy was a tool that can overthrow the ills of society.&lt;ref name=ADMUP/&gt; Galit’s assassination of Kabesang Leon symbolized the eradication of Filipinos who collaborated with the [[United States|Americans]], one of the perceived causes of the suffering of the poor in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=Varsitarian&gt;{{cite web|first=Julienne S.|last=del Mundo|url=http://www.varsitarian.net/filipino/may_pagsintay_walang_puso|title=Suring-basa:Nobelang pag-ibig ni Iñigo Ed.

'''Moneygami''' (also known as '''money-gami''')&lt;ref name=Post/&gt; is a term that arose as a [[portmanteau]] of the words [[money]] and [[origami]]. It refers to shaping [[paper currency]], such as [[India]]n [[Indian rupee|rupees]] and [[United States]] [[United States dollar|dollars]], into pieces of art. The concept has been popularized by individuals such as Japanese [[pop art]]ist Yosuke Hasegawa, who has had his work featured at an exhibition at the [[Tadu Art Gallery]], and its creation can function as [[Culture|cultural]] commentary on the value that [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] societies place on money. For example, one piece by Hasegawa involves Chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s folded head wearing a [[cowboy hat]] in a double image, based on [[Andy Warhol]]'s [[Triple Elvis|famous picture of]] [[Elvis Presley]].&lt;ref name=Nation&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/sunday/Money-changes-everything-30265660.html|title=Money changes everything|accessdate=23 September 2015|date=2 August 2015|publisher= [[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]] |first=Khetsirin|last=Pholdhampalit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name alludes to traditional origami, which is the [[Japanese art]] of folding flat materials, generally paper, into figures resembling various objects. Other examples of moneygami include folding bills into clothing-like bits, such as dollar bills becoming [[bowties]].&lt;ref name=Post&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2014/01/16/Carnegie-boy-teachs-origami/stories/201401160059|title=Carnegie boy, 12, teaches origami|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|accessdate=25 September 2015|date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2088">The '''National Hardwood Floor Association''' was a group that organized prank calls to a Christian talk radio station in the United States.

==Overview==

The National Hardwood Floor Association released an album of political [[prank calls]] to [[Christian radio]] station [[KPDQ-FM|KPDQ]] in 1992.  The only known members of the group were Joel Schalit, who later became co-editor of the magazine [[Punk Planet]] and was a member of the follow-on group [[Christal Methodists]] and the post-rock group Elders Of Zion; and Electro Motive records owner and Wetgate member Peter Conheim, who joined [[Negativland]] in the late 1990s. The NHFA's influence can be clearly discerned in both Schalit and Conheim's post-''Savage Vigilance'' recordings. The NHFA spun off another prank-call enterprise, The Christal Methodists, which also collaborated on projects with Brother Russell Ministries.

==History==

The National Hardwood Floor Association started in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] in 1987. Originally consisting of a group of undergraduate students attending Reed College, the 'band' was anointed the NHFA by Conheim for the release of the ''Savage Vigilance For A Rug-Free America'' LP. First issued by his own Electro Motive label, the CD version was produced under a cooperation agreement with Portland imprint Soleilmoon Recordings in 1993. According to the Electro Motive website, though the vinyl edition is out of print, the ''Savage Vigilance'' CD remains available.

'''Printmaking''' is the process of making [[work of art|artwork]]s by [[printing]], normally on [[paper]]. Printmaking normally covers only the process of creating prints that have an element of originality, rather than just being a photographic reproduction of a painting.  Except in the case of [[monotyping]], the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a '''print'''&lt;!--
-- cite need for bold-- term redirected to this article so need to
-- emphasise "Print" term, as redirected here from disambig page.
--
--&gt;. Each print produced is not considered a "copy" but rather is considered an "original". This is because typically each print varies to an extent due to variables intrinsic to the printmaking process, and also because the imagery of a print is typically not simply a reproduction of another work but rather is often a unique image designed from the start to be expressed in a particular printmaking technique. A print may be known as an '''impression'''&lt;!--
-- also a disabig/rediret target term
--
--&gt;. Printmaking (other than monotyping) is not chosen only for its ability to produce multiple impressions, but rather for the unique qualities that each of the printmaking processes lends itself to.

Prints are created by transferring ink from a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]] or through a prepared screen to a sheet of paper or other material. Common types of matrices include: metal plates, usually copper or zinc, or polymer plates for [[engraving]] or [[etching]]; stone, aluminum, or polymer for [[lithography]]; blocks of wood for [[woodcut]]s and [[wood engraving]]s; and linoleum for [[linocut]]s. Screens made of silk or synthetic fabrics are used for the [[screen-printing|screenprinting]] process. Other types of matrix substrates and related processes are discussed below.

Multiple impressions printed from the same matrix form an [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]. Since the late 19th century, artists have generally signed individual impressions from an edition and often number the impressions to form a limited edition; the matrix is then destroyed so that no more prints can be produced. Prints may also be printed in book form, such as illustrated books or [[artist's book]]s.

Printmaking techniques are generally divided into the following basic categories:
* [[relief print|Relief]], where ink is applied to the original surface of the matrix. Relief techniques include [[woodcut]] or [[woodblock printing|woodblock]] as the Asian forms are usually known, [[wood engraving]], [[linocut]] and [[metalcut]].
* [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]], where ink is applied beneath the original surface of the matrix. Intaglio techniques include [[engraving]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]], [[aquatint]].
* [[Planographic]], where the matrix retains its original surface, but is specially prepared and/or inked to allow for the transfer of the image. Planographic techniques include [[lithography]], [[monotyping]], and digital techniques.
* [[Stencil]], where ink or paint is pressed through a prepared screen, including [[screen-printing|screenprinting]] and [[pochoir]].

Other types of printmaking techniques outside these groups include [[collagraph]]y and [[viscosity printing]]. Collagraphy is a printmaking technique in which textured material is adhered to the printing matrix. This texture is transferred to the paper during the printing process. [[Printing#Modern printing technology|Contemporary printmaking]] may include [[digital printing]], photographic mediums, or a combination of digital, photographic, and traditional processes.

Many of these techniques can also be combined, especially within the same family. For example, Rembrandt's prints are usually referred to as "etchings" for convenience, but very often include work in engraving and [[drypoint]] as well, and sometimes have no etching at all.

{{main|woodcut}}
[[File:Vallotton-Raison.gif|thumb|[[Félix Vallotton]], ''La raison probante (The Cogent Reason)'', [[woodcut]] from the series ''Intimités'', (1898)]]

Woodcut, a type of [[relief print]], is the earliest printmaking technique, and the only one traditionally used in the Far East. It was probably first developed as a means of printing patterns on cloth, and by the 5th century was used in China for printing text and images on paper. Woodcuts of images on paper developed around 1400 in Japan, and slightly later in Europe. These are the two areas where woodcut has been most extensively used purely as a process for making images without text.
[[File:Some woodcutts of Stanislaw Raczynski.jpg|thumb|''Woodcuts of Stanislaw Raczynski (1903&amp;ndash;1982)'']]
The [[artist]] draws a design on a plank of [[wood]], or on paper which is transferred to the wood. Traditionally the artist then handed the work to a specialist cutter, who then uses sharp tools to carve away the parts of the block that will not receive ink. The surface of the block is then inked with the use of a [[brayer]], and then a sheet of [[paper]], perhaps slightly damp, is placed over the block. The block is then rubbed with a [[Baren (printing tool)|baren]] or [[spoon]], or is run through a [[printing press]]. If in color, separate blocks can be used for each [[color]], or a technique called reduction printing can be used.

Reduction printing is a name used to describe the process of using one block to print several layers of color on one print. This usually involves cutting a small amount of the block away, and then printing the block many times over on different sheets before washing the block, cutting more away and printing the next color on top. This allows the previous color to show through. This process can be repeated many times over. The advantages of this process is that only one block is needed, and that different components of an intricate design will line up perfectly. The disadvantage is that once the artist moves on to the next layer, no more prints can be made.

Another variation of woodcut printmaking is the cukil technique, made famous by the [[Taring Padi]] underground community in Java, Indonesia. Taring Padi Posters usually resemble intricately printed cartoon posters embedded with political messages. Images—usually resembling a visually complex scenario—are carved unto a wooden surface called cukilan, then smothered with printer's ink before pressing it unto media such as paper or canvas.

=== Engraving ===
{{main|Engraving}}
[[File:Melencolia I (Durero).jpg|thumb|upright|left|"[[Melencolia I]]", engraving by [[Albrecht Dürer]], one of the most important printmakers.]]
The process was developed in Germany in the 1430s from the engraving used by [[goldsmith]]s to decorate metalwork.  Engravers use a hardened steel tool called a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] to cut the design into the surface of a metal plate, traditionally made of copper. Engraving using a burin is generally a difficult skill to learn.

Gravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that yield different line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. Other tools such as mezzotint rockers, roulettes (a tool with a fine-toothed wheel) and burnishers (a tool used for making an object smooth or shiny by rubbing) are used for texturing effects.

To make a print, the engraved plate is inked all over, then the ink is wiped off the surface, leaving only ink in the engraved lines. The plate is then put through a high-pressure printing press together with a sheet of paper (often moistened to soften it). The paper picks up the ink from the engraved lines, making a print. The process can be repeated many times; typically several hundred impressions (copies) could be printed before the printing plate shows much sign of wear, except when [[drypoint]], which gives much shallower lines, is used.

In the 20th century, true engraving was revived as a serious art form by artists including [[Stanley William Hayter]] whose Studio 17 in Paris and New York City became the magnet for such artists as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Mauricio Lasansky]] and [[Joan Miró]].

=== Etching ===
&lt;div style="width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;"&gt;Artists using this technique include [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], [[Francisco Goya]], [[Wenceslaus Hollar]], [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]], [[Otto Dix]], [[James Ensor]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Käthe Kollwitz]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Lucas van Leyden]], [[Carlos Alvarado Lang]].&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Etching}}
'''Etching''' is part of the [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] family (along with [[engraving]], [[drypoint]], [[mezzotint]], and [[aquatint]].) Although the first dated etching is by [[Albrecht Dürer]] in 1515, the process is believed to have been invented by [[Daniel Hopfer]] (circa 1470-1536) of Augsburg, Germany, who decorated armor in this way, and applied the method to printmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Brian D. [http://artinprint.org/article/freedom-and-resistance-in-the-act-of-engraving-or-why-durer-gave-up-on-etching/ "Freedom and Resistance in the Act of Engraving (or, Why Dürer Gave up on Etching),"] &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt; Vol. 7 No. 3 (September-October 2017), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Etching soon came to challenge engraving as the most popular printmaking medium. Its great advantage was that, unlike engraving which requires special skill in metalworking, etching is relatively easy to learn for an artist trained in drawing.

Etching prints are generally linear and often contain fine detail and contours. [[Line art|Lines]] can vary from smooth to sketchy. An etching is opposite of a woodcut in that the raised portions of an etching remain blank while the crevices hold ink. In pure etching, a metal (usually copper, zinc or steel) plate is covered with a waxy or acrylic ground. The artist then draws through the ground with a pointed etching needle. The exposed metal lines are then etched by dipping the plate in a bath of etchant (e.g. [[nitric acid]] or [[ferric chloride]]). The etchant "bites" into the exposed metal, leaving behind lines in the plate. The remaining ground is then cleaned off the plate, and the printing process is then just the same as for engraving.

=== Mezzotint ===
{{main|Mezzotint}}
An [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] variant of engraving in which the image is formed from subtle gradations of light and shade. Mezzotint—from the Italian mezzo ("half") and tinta ("tone")—is a "dark manner" form of printmaking, which requires artists to work from dark to light. To create a mezzotint, the surface of a copper printing plate is roughened evenly all over with the aid of a tool known as a rocker; the image is then formed by smoothing the surface with a tool known as a burnisher. When inked, the roughened areas of the plate will hold more ink and print more darkly, while smoother areas of the plate hold less or no ink, and will print more lightly or not at all. It is, however, possible to create the image by only roughening the plate selectively, so working from light to dark.

Mezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones: first, because an evenly, finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink, allowing deep solid colors to be printed; secondly because the process of smoothing the texture with burin, burnisher and scraper allows fine gradations in tone to be developed.

The mezzotint printmaking method was invented by [[Ludwig von Siegen]] (1609–1680). The process was used widely in England from the mid-eighteenth century, to reproduce oil paintings and portraits.

=== Aquatint ===
[[File:Goya-Capricho-43.jpg|thumb|upright|"The sleep of Reason creates monsters", etching and aquatint by [[Francisco Goya]]]]
{{main|Aquatint}}
A technique used in [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]] etchings. Like etching, aquatint technique involves the application of acid to make marks in a metal plate. Where the etching technique uses a needle to make lines that retain ink, aquatint relies on powdered [[rosin]] which is acid resistant in the ground to create a tonal effect. The rosin is applied in a light dusting by a fan booth, the rosin is then cooked until set on the plate. At this time the rosin can be burnished or scratched out to affect its tonal qualities. The tonal variation is controlled by the level of acid exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time.

Goya used aquatint for most of his prints.

=== Drypoint===
{{main|Drypoint}}
[[File:Rembrandt The Three Crosses 1653.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Three Crosses]]'', [[drypoint]] by [[Rembrandt]]]]
A variant of engraving, done with a sharp point, rather than a v-shaped [[Burin (engraving)|burin]]. While engraved lines are very smooth and hard-edged, drypoint scratching leaves a rough burr at the edges of each line. This burr gives drypoint prints a characteristically soft, and sometimes blurry, line quality. Because the pressure of printing quickly destroys the burr, drypoint is useful only for very small editions; as few as ten or twenty impressions. To counter this, and allow for longer print runs, electro-plating (here called steelfacing) has been used since the nineteenth century to harden the surface of a plate.

The technique appears to have been invented by the [[Housebook Master]], a south German fifteenth-century artist, all of whose prints are in drypoint only. Among the most famous artists of the old master print: Albrecht Dürer produced three drypoints before abandoning the technique; Rembrandt used it frequently, but usually in conjunction with etching and engraving.
{{clear}}
=== Lithography ===
&lt;div style="width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;"&gt;Artists using this technique include
[[Honoré Daumier]],
[[Vincent van Gogh]],
[[George Bellows]],
[[Pierre Bonnard]],
[[Edvard Munch]],
[[Emil Nolde]],
[[Pablo Picasso]],
[[Odilon Redon]],
[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]],
[[Salvador Dalí]],
[[M. C. Escher]],
[[Willem de Kooning]],
[[Joan Miró]],
[[Stow Wengenroth]]
&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Lithography}}
[[File:Toulouse-Lautrec - Moulin Rouge - La Goulue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[La Goulue]]'', Lithograph poster by [[Toulouse-Lautrec]].]]
[[Lithography]] is a technique invented in 1798 by [[Alois Senefelder]] and based on the [[Cohesion (chemistry)|chemical repulsion]] of [[oil]] and [[water]].
A porous surface, normally [[limestone]], is used; the image is drawn on the limestone with a greasy medium.
Acid is applied, transferring the grease to the limestone, leaving the image 'burned' into the surface. [[Gum arabic]], a water-soluble substance, is then applied, sealing the surface of the stone not covered with the drawing medium.
The stone is wetted, with water staying only on the surface not covered in grease-based residue of the drawing; the stone is then 'rolled up', meaning oil ink is applied with a roller covering the entire surface; since water repels the oil in the ink, the ink adheres only to the greasy parts, perfectly inking the image.
A sheet of dry paper is placed on the surface, and the image is transferred to the paper by the pressure of the printing press. Lithography is known for its ability to capture fine gradations in shading and very small detail.

A variant is [[photo-lithography]], in which the image is captured by photographic processes on metal plates; printing is carried out in the same way.

=== Screenprinting ===
&lt;div style="width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;"&gt;Artists using this technique include
[[Josef Albers]],
[[Ralston Crawford]],
[[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]].
[[Robert Indiana]],
[[Roy Lichtenstein]],
[[Julian Opie]],
[[Bridget Riley]],
[[Edward Ruscha]],
[[Andy Warhol]], and
[[Carlos Alvarado Lang]].
&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Screenprinting}}
[[Screen-printing|Screenprinting]] (occasionally known as "silkscreen", or "serigraphy") creates prints by using a fabric stencil technique; ink is simply pushed through the stencil against the surface of the paper, most often with the aid of a squeegee. Generally, the technique uses a natural or synthetic 'mesh' fabric stretched tightly across a rectangular 'frame,' much like a stretched canvas. The fabric can be silk, nylon monofilament, multifilament polyester, or even stainless steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://awt-gpi.com/product148.htm |title=Screen Fabric |website=A.W.T. World Trade Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While commercial screenprinting often requires high-tech, mechanical apparatuses and calibrated materials, printmakers value it for the "Do It Yourself" approach, and the low technical requirements, high quality results. The essential tools required are a squeegee, a mesh fabric, a frame, and a stencil. Unlike many other printmaking processes, a printing press is not required, as screenprinting is essentially stencil printing.

Screenprinting may be adapted to printing on a variety of materials, from paper, cloth, and canvas to rubber, glass, and metal. Artists have used the technique to print on bottles, on slabs of granite, directly onto walls, and to reproduce images on textiles which would distort under pressure from printing presses.

=== Monotype ===
[[File:Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione - The Creation of Adam - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Monotype]] by the technique's inventor, [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], ''The Creation of Adam'', c 1642]]
{{main|Monotyping}}
Monotyping is a type of printmaking made by drawing or painting on a smooth, non-absorbent surface. The surface, or matrix, was historically a copper etching plate, but in contemporary work it can vary from zinc or glass to acrylic glass. The image is then transferred onto a sheet of paper by pressing the two together, usually using a printing-press. Monotypes can also be created by inking an entire surface and then, using brushes or rags, removing ink to create a subtractive image, e.g. creating lights from a field of opaque color. The inks used may be oil based or water based. With oil based inks, the paper may be dry, in which case the image has more contrast, or the paper may be damp, in which case the image has a 10 percent greater range of tones.

Unlike [[monoprinting]], monotyping produces a unique print, or monotype, because most of the ink is removed during the initial pressing. Although subsequent reprintings are sometimes possible, they differ greatly from the first print and are generally considered inferior. A second print from the original plate is called a "ghost print" or "cognate". Stencils, watercolor, solvents, brushes, and other tools are often used to embellish a monotype print. Monotypes are often spontaneously executed and with no preliminary sketch.

Monotypes are the most painterly method among the printmaking techniques, a unique print that is essentially a printed painting. The principal characteristic of this medium is found in its spontaneity and its combination of printmaking, painting, and drawing media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonprintmakers.com/resources/techniques/monoprint Washington printmakers' gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228183408/http://washingtonprintmakers.com/resources/techniques/monoprint |date=2010-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monoprint ===
{{main|Monoprinting}}
Monoprinting is a form of printmaking that uses a matrix such as a woodblock, litho stone, or copper plate, but produces impressions that are unique. Multiple unique impressions printed from a single matrix are sometimes known as a variable edition. There are many techniques used in monoprinting, including [[collagraph]], [[collage]], hand-painted additions, and a form of tracing by which thick ink is laid down on a table, paper is placed on the ink, and the back of the paper is drawn on, transferring the ink to the paper. Monoprints can also be made by altering the type, color, and viscosity of the ink used to create different prints. Traditional printmaking techniques, such as lithography, woodcut, and intaglio, can be used to make monoprints.

=== Mixed-media prints ===
Mixed-media prints may use multiple traditional printmaking processes such as etching, woodcut, letterpress, silkscreen, or even monoprinting in the creation of the print. They may also incorporate elements of chine colle, collage, or painted areas, and may be unique, i.e. one-off, non-editioned, prints. Mixed-media prints are often experimental prints and may be printed on unusual, non-traditional surfaces.

=== Digital prints ===
&lt;div style="width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;"&gt;Artists using this technique include
[[Istvan Horkay]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Enrique Chagoya]]
&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Digital printing}}
Digital prints refers to images printed using digital printers such as [[Inkjet printing|inkjet printers]] instead of a traditional printing press. Images can be printed to a variety of substrates including paper, cloth, or plastic canvas. 

====Dye-based inks====
Dye-based inks are [[organic compound|organic]] (not [[mineral]]) dissolved and mixed into a liquid. Although most are synthetic, derived from [[petroleum]], they can be made from vegetable or animal sources. Dyes are well suited for textiles where the liquid dye penetrates and chemically bonds to the fiber. Because of the deep penetration, more layers of material must lose their color before the fading is apparent. Dyes, however, are not suitable for the relatively thin layers of ink laid out on the surface of a print.

====Pigment-based inks====
Pigment is a finely ground, particulate substance which, when mixed or ground into a liquid to make ink or paint, does not dissolve, but remains dispersed or suspended in the liquid. Pigments are categorized as either [[inorganic]] (mineral) or organic (synthetic).&lt;ref name="MagnoliaFAQ"&gt;[http://www.magnoliaeditions.com/pages/FAQs.htm Printmaking FAQ at Magnolia Editions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413021716/http://magnoliaeditions.com/pages/FAQs.htm |date=2009-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pigment-based inks have a much longer permanence than dye-based inks.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Carden, Digital Textile Printing, Bloomsbury Publishing - 2015, page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

====Giclée====
[[Giclée]] (pron.: /ʒiːˈkleɪ/ zhee-KLAY or /dʒiːˈkleɪ/), is a neologism coined in 1991 by printmaker Jack Duganne &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Harald. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dq3Xj8zEYMIC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=giclee+prints+produced+on+epson#PPA11,M1 ''Mastering Digital Printing'', p.11] at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; for digital prints made on inkjet printers. Originally associated with early dye-based printers it is now more often refers to pigment-based prints.&lt;ref&gt;Luong, Q.-Tuan. [http://www.largeformatphotography.info/digital-printing.html An overview of large format color digital printing] at largeformatphotography.info&lt;/ref&gt; The word is based on the French word gicleur, which means "nozzle". Today fine art prints produced on large format ink-jet machines using the [[CcMmYK color model]] are generally called "Giclée".

=== Foil imaging ===
In art, '''foil imaging''' is a printmaking technique made using the Iowa Foil Printer, developed by [[Virginia A. Myers]] from the commercial [[foil stamping]] process. This uses gold leaf and acrylic [[Foil (chemistry)|foil]] in the printmaking process.

== Color ==
[[File:Mishima Asa-Giri-東海道五十三次之内 三島 朝霧-Morning Mist MET DP123235.jpg|thumb|[[Hiroshige]], ''Morning Mist'']]
Printmakers apply color to their prints in many different ways. Some coloring techniques include positive surface roll, negative surface roll, and [[A la poupée]]. Often color in printmaking that involves etching, [[screenprinting]], woodcut, or [[linocut]] is applied by either using separate plates, blocks or screens or by using a reductionist approach. In multiple plate color techniques, a number of plates, screens or blocks are produced, each providing a different color. Each separate plate, screen, or block will be inked up in a different color and applied in a particular sequence to produce the entire picture. On average about three to four plates are produced, but there are occasions where a printmaker may use up to seven plates. Every application of another plate of color will interact with the color already applied to the paper, and this must be kept in mind when producing the separation of colors. The lightest colors are often applied first, and then darker colors successively until the darkest.

The reductionist approach to producing color is to start with a lino or wood block that is either blank or with a simple etching. Upon each printing of color the printmaker will then further cut into the lino or woodblock removing more material and then apply another color and reprint. Each successive removal of lino or wood from the block will expose the already printed color to the viewer of the print. Picasso is often cited as the inventor of reduction printmaking, although there is evidence of this method in use 25 years before Picasso's linocuts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.printsandprintmaking.gov.au/catalogues/bibliography/136140/bunbury-alisa-not-picassos-invention--a-foray-into.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[subtractive color]] concept is also used in [[offset printing|offset]] or [[digital print]] and is present in bitmap or vectorial software in [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] or other color spaces.

== Registration ==
In printmaking processes requiring more than one application of ink or other medium, the problem exists as to how to line up properly areas of an image to receive ink in each application. The most obvious example of this would be a multi-color image in which each color is applied in a separate step. The lining up of the results of each step in a multistep printmaking process is called "registration." Proper registration results in the various components of an image being in their proper place. But, for artistic reasons, improper registration is not necessarily the ruination of an image.

This can vary considerably from process to process. It generally involves placing the substrate, generally paper, in correct alignment with the printmaking element that will be supplying it with coloration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nontoxicprint.com/perfectregistration.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protective printmaking equipment ==
Protective clothing is very important for printmakers who engage in etching and lithography (closed toed shoes and long pants). Whereas in the past printmakers put their plates in and out of acid baths with their bare hands, today printmakers use rubber gloves.  They also wear industrial [[respirator]]s for protection from caustic vapors. Most acid baths are built with ventilation hoods above them.

Protective respirators and masks should have particle filters, particularly for aquatinting. As a part of the aquatinting process, a printmaker is often exposed to [[rosin]] powder.  Rosin is a serious health hazard, especially to printmakers who, in the past, simply used to hold their breath {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} using an aquatinting booth.

In the fields of engineering and construction, '''resilience''' is an objective of design, maintenance and restoration for [[building]]s and [[infrastructure]], as well as communities. It is the ability to absorb or avoid damage without suffering complete failure.&lt;ref name =Scandia&gt;[http://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/news_releases/motivating-business-to-design-a-more-resilient-nation-one-building-at-a-time/ "Motivating business to design a more resilient nation, one building at a time"] news release by Scandia National Laboratories July 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ResilienceCertification &gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-013-9440-y#page-1 Resilience certification for commercial buildings: a study of stakeholder perspectives”] ''Environment Systems and Decisions'' June 2013, Volume 33, Issue 2, pp 184-194 Barbara J. Jennings, Eric D. Vugrin, and Deborah K. Belasich&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Graph-Theoretic Framework for Assessing the Resilience of Sectorised Water Distribution Networks|journal = Water Resources Management|volume = 30|issue = 5|date = 2016-02-13|issn = 0920-4741|pages = 1–15|doi = 10.1007/s11269-016-1245-6|language = en|first = Manuel|last = Herrera|first2 = Edo|last2 = Abraham|first3 = Ivan|last3 = Stoianov}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more comprehensive definition is that it is the ability to respond, absorb, and adapt to, as well as recover in a disruptive event. A resilient structure/system/community is expected to be able to resist to an extreme event with minimal damages and functionality disruptions during the event; after the event, it should be able to rapidly recovery its functionality similar to or even better than the pre-event level.   

The concept of resilience originated from ecology and then gradually applied to other fields. It is related to that of vulnerability. Both terms are specific to the event perturbation, meaning that a system/infrastructure/community may be more vulnerable or less resilient to one event than another one. However, they are not the same. One obvious difference is that vulnerability focuses on the evaluation of system susceptibility in the pre-event phase; resilience emphasizes the dynamic features in the pre-event, during-event, and post-event phases&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Wenjuan|last2=Bocchini|first2=Paolo|last3=Davison|first3=Brian|year=2018|title=Resilience metrics and measurement methods for transportation infrastructure: the state of the art|url=|journal=Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure|volume=|pages=1–32|doi=10.1080/23789689.2018.1448663|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Resilience is a multi-facet property, covering four dimensions: technical, organization, social and economic &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bruneau|first=Michel|last2=Chang|first2=Stephanie E.|last3=Eguchi|first3=Ronald T.|last4=Lee|first4=George C.|last5=O’Rourke|first5=Thomas D.|last6=Reinhorn|first6=Andrei M.|last7=Shinozuka|first7=Masanobu|last8=Tierney|first8=Kathleen|last9=Wallace|first9=William A.|date=November 2003|title=A Framework to Quantitatively Assess and Enhance the Seismic Resilience of Communities|journal=Earthquake Spectra|language=en-US|volume=19|issue=4|pages=733–752|doi=10.1193/1.1623497|issn=8755-2930}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, using one metric may not be representative to describe and quantify resilience. In engineering, resilience is characterized by four Rs: robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity. Current research studies have developed various ways to quantify resilience from multiple aspects, such as functionality- and socioeconomic- related aspects&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.   

== Functionality-related resilience metrics ==
The first influential quantitative resilience metric based on the functionality recovery curve was proposed by Bruneau et al. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, where resilience is quantified as the resilience loss as follows.    

&lt;math&gt;R_L=\int_{t_0}^{t_f} [100\%-Q(t)]dt&lt;/math&gt;       

where &lt;math&gt;Q(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the functionality at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the time when the event strikes; &lt;math&gt;t_f&lt;/math&gt; is the time when the functionality full recovers.    

The resilience loss is a metric of a only positive value. It has the advantage of being easily generalized to different structures, infrastructures, and communities. This definition assumes that the functionality is 100% pre-event and will eventually be recovered to a full functionality of 100%. This may not be true in practice. A system may be partially functional when a hurricane strikes and may not be fully recovered due to uneconomic cost-benefit ratio.    

Resilience index is a normalized metric between 0 and 1, computed from the functionality recovery curve &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=D.A.|last2=Kapur|first2=K.C.|last3=Christie|first3=R.D.|date=June 2009|title=Methodology for Assessing the Resilience of Networked Infrastructure|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4912342/|journal=IEEE Systems Journal|language=en-US|volume=3|issue=2|pages=174–180|doi=10.1109/jsyst.2009.2017396|issn=1932-8184}}&lt;/ref&gt;.    

&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{\int_{t_0}^{t_h}  Q(t)dt }{t_h-t_0}&lt;/math&gt;   

where  &lt;math&gt;Q(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the functionality at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the time when the event strikes; &lt;math&gt;t_h&lt;/math&gt; is the time horizon of interest.

== Socioeconomic-related resilience metrics ==
Socioeconomic resilience metrics fall into two categories: system-based and capital-based. System-based socioeconomic resilience metrics focus on quantifying the post-event business continuity and operability, whereas capital-based resilience metric measure resilience from the capital of individuals and communities &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

The '''Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland''' was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scottish public body|public body]].

It was appointed in 1927 "to enquire into such questions of public amenity or of artistic importance relating to Scotland as may be referred to them by any of our Departments of State and to report thereon to such Departments; and furthermore, to give advice on similar questions when so requested by public or quasi-public bodies when it appears to the said Commission that their assistance would be advantageous".

In 2005 it was replaced by [[Architecture and Design Scotland]].

'''''Saint-Georges majeur au crépuscule''''' (Eng: '''''Dusk in Venice''''', '''''San Giorgio Maggiore by Twilight'''''&lt;ref name="NMW" /&gt; or '''''Sunset in Venice''''') refers to an [[Impressionist]] painting by [[Claude Monet]], which exists in more than one version. It forms part of a series of views of the monastery-island of [[San Giorgio Maggiore]]. This series is in turn part of a larger series of views of [[Venice]] which Monet began in 1908 during his only visit there.

==Versions in Cardiff and Tokyo==
One version of ''San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk'' was acquired in Paris by the Welsh art collector [[Gwendoline Davies]]. She bequeathed it to the Art Gallery (now [[National Museum Cardiff]]) in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]].  The painting is normally on display there.&lt;ref name="NMW"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/art/online/?action=show_item&amp;item=1336 | title=San Giorgio Maggiore by Twilight | publisher=National Museum Wales ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: Amgueddfa Cymru) | accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Western"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-242800392.html | title=The Duck Pond That Grew into a 'French' Lake; How Did Claude Monet's Famous Paintings of Water Lilies Inspire Wales' Greatest Art-Collecting Sisters? | publisher=[[Western Mail (Wales)|''Western Mail'']] | author=Williams, Sally (2010)}} Retrieved 2014 via [[HighBeam Research]] (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;

The other version is in the [[Bridgestone Museum of Art]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref name="Bridgestone"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bridgestone-museum.gr.jp/en/collection/works/2/ | title=Twilight, Venice | publisher=Bridgestone Museum of Art | accessdate=2 February 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202112850/http://www.bridgestone-museum.gr.jp/en/collection/works/2/ | archivedate=2 February 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''San Giorgio Maggiore al Crepuscolo'': Description of the painting==
''San Giorgio Maggiore al Crepuscolo'' is approximately two-by-three feet and painted in oil on canvas. It depicts mysterious buildings that seem to magically appear from the surrounding landscape, they almost seem to float in the background.  The forms are gently inserted, though not enough to disguise their identity.  The painting focuses on the [[Church of San Giorgio Maggiore]] with its bell tower rising to the top of the painting. To the right are the faintly visible domes of [[Santa Maria della Salute]] and the mouth of the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]].

==Monet and San Giorgio Maggiore==
Monet painted the church of San Giorgio Maggiore in six lighting conditions. With this varied approach, the paintings focused on the ‘nature of experience.’
He was particularly impressed by the Venetian sunsets, “these splendid sunsets which are unique in the world.” He had previously been inspired by other sunsets, such as those of [[Normandy]] (in ''[[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral]]'' and ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]'', his series of the 1890s) and London ([[Houses of Parliament series (Monet)|''Houses of Parliament'']]).

===Viewpoints===
[[File:Isola di s giorgio maggiore pano.jpg|thumbnail|This photo separates the campanile and dome of San Giorgio Maggiore, as it is taken from a position nearer the Grand Canal than the dusk paintings.]]
Monet and his wife [[Alice Hoschedé|Alice]] stayed at the [[Palazzo Barbaro]] for a couple of weeks, and then moved to the Hotel Britannia, where they stayed until December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westineuropareginavenice.com/en/hotel-history The hotel's name has since changed to the Hotel Europa and Regina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218062329/http://www.westineuropareginavenice.com/en/hotel-history |date=2014-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Mme. Monet, the Britannia had a view, "if such a thing were possible, even more beautiful than that of Palazzo Barbaro..." 
Monet painted looking out from this hotel, but not, it seems, in the case of this particular painting. Although the view from the hotel included the church of San Giorgio Maggiore, the painting at dusk appears to have been viewed from the waterfront known as the [[Riva degli Schiavoni]], where the island forms a focal point of the view.
Monet was reportedly reluctant to paint from the waterfront. He disliked crowds of tourists and he was also worried about conforming to other artists who were drawn to Venice, such as [[Renoir]] or [[Manet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/events/exhibitions/extramural/exhibitions/article/manet-ritorno-a-venezia-36755.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=253&amp;cHash=b2bbf4444d Manet. Ritorno a Venezia]. [[Musée d'Orsay]]&lt;/ref&gt;  San Giorgio Maggiore was a favorite subject for painters, including the proto-Impressionist [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-venice-san-giorgio-maggiore-early-morning-d15254 Venice: San Giorgio Maggiore - Early Morning 1819]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-venice-san-giorgio-maggiore-at-sunset-from-the-hotel-europa-d32165 Venice: San Giorgio Maggiore at Sunset, from the Hotel Europa 1840]. [[Tate]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Completion of the paintings in France==
Monet felt Venice was a city "too beautiful to be painted",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intermonet.com/venice/ Claude Monet in Venice]&lt;/ref&gt; which may be why he returned with many paintings unfinished to [[Giverny]], his home in France.&lt;ref name=ima /&gt;  However, he had already retreated from his earlier practice of painting from life, in front of the subject. He worked on the Venetian scenes at home and the death of his wife [[Alice Hoschedé|Alice]] in 1911 seems to have been a factor in their completion. 
[[File:Claude Monet - Twilight, Venice.jpg|thumbnail|Version owned by the Bridgestone Museum of Art in Tokyo.]]

==Dispersal==
In 1912 the Venice paintings were mainly dispersed as a result of a successful exhibition of twenty-nine canvases. This exhibition, entitled ''Claude Monet Venise'', was held at the gallery [[Bernheim-Jeune]] in Paris. The same gallery had hosted exhibitions of the Rouen and London series.

== In popular culture ==

The painting became familiar in 1999 after its appearance in [[John McTiernan]]’s [[heist film]] [[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|''The Thomas Crown Affair'']]. In the film the picture is taken from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].  In fact, the Metropolitan does not own the painting, although they have another of Monet's Venetian scenes ''[[The Doge's Palace Seen from San Giorgio Maggiore (Claude Monet)|The Doge's Palace Seen from San Giorgio Maggiore]]''.

==See also==
Other paintings from Monet's [[San Giorgio Maggiore (Monet series)|''San Giorgio Maggiore'' series]] are to be seen in Cardiff and [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]&lt;ref name=ima&gt;[http://collection.imamuseum.org/artwork/56280 The Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice], Indianapolis Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sandu Florea''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈsandu ˈflore̯a}}; born 28 June 1946) is a [[Romanian-American]] [[comic book]] and [[comic strip]] [[Comic book creator|creator]], also known as an [[inker]] and [[Illustration|book illustrator]]. A trained architect and a presence on the [[science fiction]] scene during the 1970s, he became a professional in the [[comics]] genre with albums such as ''Galbar'', and was allegedly the only artist to have obtained a steady income in this way during the [[Communist Romania|communist period]]. A prolific contributor to Romanian children's magazines, Florea had his activity curbed by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]] when he first publicized his intention of emigrating to the United States. He eventually left the country shortly after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], and soon after began collaborating with [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], [[DC Comics]] and other leading enterprises in the field of comic book publishing. He became especially noted for his activities as an inker, with contributions on series such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[The Executioner (book series)|The Executioner]]'', ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'' and ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]''.

Florea has maintained enduring contacts with his native country, and has taken an initiative in popularizing the [[American comic book]] style in Romania. He has been described as one of the most successful among his colleagues, and claimed to be one of the most recognizable Romanians in his field.

==Biography==

===Early life and career in Romania===
[[File:Galbar Sandu Florea.jpg|thumb|left|Scene from ''Galbar'' (1973)]]
Born in [[Ghelari]], [[Hunedoara County]], Sandu Florea first became interested in comics while in fifth grade, his first contact with the medium being through a copy of the [[France|French]] youth magazine ''[[Pif gadget|Pif Vaillant]]''.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"&gt;{{ro icon}} Petrina Calabalic, [http://old.banateanul.ro/articol/ziar/timisoara/cartoon-man/4064/ "Cartoon Man"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008123647/http://old.banateanul.ro/articol/ziar/timisoara/cartoon-man/4064/ |date=2011-10-08 }}, in ''[[Bănăţeanul]]'', December 6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This encounter, he recalled in a 2004 interview, left him with "an impression that cannot be erased", and "the wish that I myself could draw such appealing and interesting characters."&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;

Sandu Florea published his first comic strip in 1968, with ''Luminiţa'' children's magazine. It was a series centered on the anecdotal hero classic ''[[Păcală]]''.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.icr.ro/sandu_florea ''Artistul Sandu Florea la Salonul European de Bandă Desenată''], [[Romanian Cultural Institute]] release; retrieved November 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Florea graduated from [[Bucharest]]'s [[Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism|Architectural College]], and subsequently worked for a building design institute in his adoptive city of [[Timişoara]].&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; Before graduation, he had also published his first work in the comics genre, inspired by the [[Folklore of Romania|folkloric tale]] of ''[[Păcală]]'', and featured in a 1968 issue of ''Luminiţa'' magazine.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;

After moving to Timişoara, he became a noted presence among the local [[science fiction]] fan base, joining the [[H. G. Wells]] Literary Club founded by writer Ovidiu Şurianu.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; Their collaboration produced the 1973 ''Galbar'', reportedly the first Romanian [[Science fiction comics|science fiction comic book]].&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfnemira"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://proscris.110mb.com/Ps13-14/florea13.htm "Florea, Sandu"], entry in [[Editura Nemira]]'s ''Dicţionar SF'', 1999 (republished by [http://proscris.110mb.com/ ''Pro-Scris''] [[webzine]]); retrieved August 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, he and Timişoara native Marcel Luca published what is thought to be the first-ever Romanian [[coloring book]] with a science fiction subject, ''Vreau să fiu cosmonaut'' ("I Want to be a [[Cosmonaut]]"), which reputedly sold 45,000 copies.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; By then, having received offers of collaboration from two publishing houses ([[Editura Ion Creangă]] and Editura Facla), Florea settled back in Bucharest and focused exclusively on his work in comics and illustration.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt; Said to have been the most prolific comic book author active during the communist period, he had his work featured in almost all of the children's periodicals in print at the time.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was creating and publishing comic books dedicated to popular legends, such as a retake on [[Ion Creangă]]'s [[Fantasy literature|fantasy story]] ''[[Harap Alb]]'', or recounting episodes in [[History of Romania|Romanian history]] (involving [[Dacia]]n rulers [[Burebista]] and [[Decebalus]], [[Roman Emperor]] [[Trajan]],&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cpbatman"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cosmin Popan, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/batman_omorat_in_complicitate_cu_un_roman-65685.html "Batman, omorât în complicitate cu un român"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', November 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wallachia]]n [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Michael the Brave]]).&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt; Several single-issue albums in this category were based on texts by [[historical fiction]] author [[Radu Theodoru]], forming part of the series ''Strămoşii'' ("The Ancestors").&lt;ref name="sflambiek"&gt;[http://lambiek.net/artists/f/florea_sandu.htm "Sandu Florea (Romania)"], entry in [[Lambiek]]'s [http://lambiek.net/artists/ ''Comiclopedia'']; retrieved August 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The full list includes: ''Cavalerul alb'' ("The White Knight"; Editura Facla, 1976), ''Călugăreni'' (referencing the [[Battle of Călugăreni]]; Editura Ion Creangă, 1977), ''Misiune de sacrificiu'' ("Suicidal Mission"; Editura Ion Creangă, 1979), ''În lumea lui Harap Alb'' ("Inside Harap Alb's World"; [[Editura Sport-Turism]], 1979), ''Burebista, regele dacilor'' ("Burebista, King of the Dacians"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1980), ''{{lang|ro|Decebal şi Traian}}'' ("Decebalus and Trajan"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1981), ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}'' ("Carousel"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1982), ''Sarmizegetusa eroică'' ("Heroic [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]]"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1983).&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt; Florea was also involved in creating Romania's own [[Western comics]], adapted from stories by Nicolae Frînculescu.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt;

These works received critical attention, both in Romania and abroad. ''În lumea lui Harap Alb'' earned him the a [[Eurocon]] award (1980).&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sflambiek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mhpremiile"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Michael Hăulică]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/FANTASY-SCIENCE-FICTION.-Premiile-care-au-fost*articleID_14094-articles_details.html "Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction. Premiile care au fost"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 290, October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This, literary critic [[Michael Hăulică]] notes, made Florea one in a final wave of Romanian Eurocon laureates to have emerged under communism (also including writers [[Vladimir Colin]], [[Ion Hobana]] and [[Gheorghe Săsărman]]).&lt;ref name="mhpremiile"/&gt;

Florea also received attention from celebrated poet [[Nichita Stănescu]], who discovered in ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}'' an unclassifiable and imaginative work. The writer argued: "[Florea] introduces mystery where we usually had happy-endings, imagination where there was lyricism and an indecisive epic where there was nothing. The book he calls ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}'' [...] is without precedent, in Romania and everywhere else."&lt;ref name="poeziebd"&gt;{{ro icon}} D.

Florea printed the [[Lithography|lithographs]] to go with the poems, but the project was cut short when Stănescu died (December 1983).&lt;ref name="poeziebd"/&gt;

===In the United States===
The 1984-1989 interval was described by Florea as "one of the most difficult periods in my life."&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; Having unsuccessfully demanded from communist authorities the right of leaving for the United States, where two of his siblings had already settled, Florea was exposed to political persecution, and the [[Censorship in Communist Romania|censorship apparatus]] lifted his right to publish, prompting him to contribute several comic strips under various pseudonyms.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; He returned to public attention after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], when he was briefly editor in chief of the new children's magazine ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}''.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sflambiek"/&gt; With Frînculescu, he also founded another such publication, called ''Proteus''.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;

Sandu Florea, his wife and two children eventually left for the United States in 1991, moving to [[New York City]]&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; and afterward settling in [[Long Island]].&lt;ref name="dnnautil"&gt;{{ro icon}} Dodo Niţă, [http://www.nautilus.nemira.ro/bd/batman-rip/ "''Batman R.I.P.''"], in [[Editura Nemira]]'s ''Nautilus'', March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially discouraged by the competition among comic book artists, Florea recounts, he decided to contact Marvel [[recruiter]]s within three months of his arrival, submitting a sample of his take on ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]''.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; According to his own statement, [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] proved compatible with his talents: "[he was] the only Marvel character who did not fly, did not breathe fire and did not use psychic waves to defeat his enemies, being instead armed with a giant sword and axe. Since I had been drawing many historical tales back in the old country, Conan was a character whom I could depict in drawing with relative ease."&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;

He was accepted by Marvel soon after this, specialized as an inker, and began working on several of its main releases, including, alongside ''Conan'', ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and the various spin-offs of ''[[avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', ''[[Blackwulf]]'', ''[[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]'', ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Mighty Thor]]'', ''[[Captain America]]'', ''[[Doctor Strange]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sflambiek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; He also worked with [[DC Comics]] (on ''[[Superman (vol. 2)|Superman Second Series]]'',&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'',&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cpbatman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; ''[[Justice Society of America]]'', ''[[Nightwing]]'')&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; and [[Dark Horse Comics]],&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cpbatman"/&gt; signing additional collaborations with [[Innovation Publishing]], Vivid Comics (on ''[[The Executioner (book series)|The Executioner]]'')&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt; and [[Chaos! Comics]] (''[[Lady Death]]'', ''[[Undertaker (comics)|Undertaker]]'').&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; Among the significant miniseries to which he contributed as an inker are ''[[X-Men: The End]]'' (2004–2006),&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'' (2008),&lt;ref name="cpbatman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; and ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]'' (2009).&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; His work with Dark Horse included ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sflambiek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; and ''[[List of Angel comics|Angel]]''.&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; His artistic production also touched other media: Florea created [[storyboard]]s and other graphics for the motion picture producers [[Full Moon Features|Full Moon]], as well as book illustrations for ''[[The Princeton Review]]''.&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt;

===2000s initiatives===
[[File:10.15.11SanduFloreaByLuigiNovi2.jpg|thumb|Florea looking over an aspiring artist's portfolio at the 2011 New York Comic Con.]]
Florea was selected honorary president of the Romanian Association of Comic Book Fans in 2001.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt; Speaking in 2004, he expressed interest in relaunching the native comic book genre in his native country, and in publishing a new children's periodical with original content.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; In 2006, he participated in the relaunch of ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}'', in a version argued by Hăulică to have been "professional under any definition."&lt;ref name="mhahbd"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Michael Hăulică]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/FANTASY-SCIENCE-FICTION.-Ah-BD*articleID_15202-articles_details.html "Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction. Ah, BD!"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 315, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication, which went out of print after only two issues due to distribution problems, included [[Romanian-language]] reprints of American comics such as ''Conan the Barbarian'' and ''[[Aliens (Dark Horse Comics publications)|Aliens]]'', alongside original collaborations between Florea and his Romanian colleagues: ''Două paloşe'' ("Two [[Backsword]]s", with Florea as artist and György Györfi-Deák as writer), ''Ultima frontieră'' ("The Final Frontier", text by Florea, Marian Mirescu and Eddie Pandele, drawings by Daniel Rizea and Cătălin Gospodin), ''Toxic'' (text by Florea, drawings by Tudor Popa), ''Leviathan'' (written by Cristian Lăzărescu, illustrated by Florea).&lt;ref name="mhahbd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mhbd"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Michael Hăulică]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/FANTASY-SCIENCE-FICTION.-BD*articleID_13366-articles_details.html "Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction. BD"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 273, June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also featured ''Borderland'', a comic series conceived especially for a Romanian public by writer [[John Warner (comics)|John Warner]] and illustrated by Florea, depicting the confrontation between three worlds: of the Mortals, of Magic and of the Demons.&lt;ref name="mhbd"/&gt; Around the same time, Sandu Florea also began contributing to various Romanian [[webzine]]s, such as ''Pro-Scris'', ''Imagikon'' and ''Paradox''—the latter of which published his strip ''Fortăreaţa'', based on a short story by Ovidiu Bufnilă.&lt;ref name="mhbd"/&gt; Several aspects related to the artist's new Romanian ventures were however criticized by Michael Hăulică. He argued that ''Toxic'' in particular was "weak and obvious", and noted that, in its featured edition, the text of ''Borderland'' evidenced its translator's poor command of the Romanian language.&lt;ref name="mhbd"/&gt;

These initiatives helped cement the artist's reputation in Romania. Sandu Florea claims to be "The only Romanian professional graphic artist who has managed to make a living exclusively out of his drawings, in the old country as well as [...] in America."&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; Dodo Niţă, a historiographer of Romanian comics and Florea's colleague at ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}'',&lt;ref name="mhbd"/&gt; placed ''În lumea lui Harap Alb'' as fifth among an all-time chart of original Romanian works in the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioana Calen, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/cartarescu_e_tras_in_banda_provocarea_desenata-12202.html "Cărtărescu e tras în bandă - Provocarea desenată"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', June 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2008 piece in the Romanian daily ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', Florea shares the distinction of "best known Romanian comic book artist" with [[Mircea Arapu]], the latter being known for his contribution in [[Franco-Belgian comics|Francophone comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Adrian Grama, Vlad Stoicescu, [http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/810028/Rahan-si-Pif-scapati-de-comunism/ "Rahan şi Pif, scăpaţi de comunism"], in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', June 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

An annual Romanian comic book [[fan convention]] in [[Constanţa]] awards the Sandu Florea Prize to artists with a long contribution in their field.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} George Onofrei, [http://www.supliment.polirom.ro/article.aspx?article=4171 "Lucian Amarii a cîştigat Premiul ''Sandu Florea'' pentru BD.

In [[Biblical criticism]], '''''Sitz im Leben''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈzɪt͡s ɪm ˈle:bn̩}}) is a [[German language|German]] phrase roughly translating to "setting in life". It stands for the alleged context in which a text, or object, has been created, and its function and purpose at that time. The ''Sitz im Leben'' is also used to refer to the social, ethnic and cultural setting of a site at a particular era. When interpreting a text, object, or region, the ''Sitz im Leben'' has to be taken into consideration in order to allow a proper contextual interpretation. 

==Origins==
The term originated with the German Protestant theologian [[Hermann Gunkel]]. The term ''Sitz im Volksleben'' ("setting in the life of the people") was employed for the first time in 1906 and the term ''Sitz im Leben'' in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;''Prophets and paradigms: essays in honor of Gene M. Tucker'' ed. Gene M. Tucker, Stephen Breck Reid 1996 p. 113 Form-Criticism of the Old Testament (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Sitz im Leben'' was used by classic form critics, as pointed out by Chris Tuckett, "...it has been pointed out that the term ''Sitz im Leben'' was used in a rather peculiar way by the classic [[Form criticism|form critics]]. In fact the term is a sociological one, describing a typical situation within any community"&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Mark Tuckett ''Reading the New Testament: methods of interpretation'' 1987 – 200.14"&lt;/ref&gt; so that the meaning of the text is bound up with its function in the community,&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Kraus, R. Glenn Wooden ''Septuagint research: issues and challenges'' 2006 p. 23 "With the introduction of the term ''Sitz im Leben'' we see that for NETS the meaning and significance of the text is bound up with its inferred function within the community that produced it."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Contextualization (sociolinguistics)|social context]].&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Rendtorff ''The Old Testament: an introduction'' 1985 "Gunkel's term 'Sitz im Leben' denotes a particular situation of communication with which a genre – or even several genres – may be connected. In a more comprehensive sense the term can therefore also denote the social context in ..."&lt;/ref&gt; However some have noted that use in Biblical [[exegesis]] can be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;W. S. Vorster, J. Eugene Botha – ''Speaking of Jesus: essays on biblical language, gospel narrative'' 1999 p. 336 ("The use of the term ''Sitz im Leben'' has become very misleading and problematic, see Guttgemanns 1970:82ff.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contextualization==
At its simplest, it describes what occasions certain passages in the [[Bible]] were written for, and is often called the "genres" of the Bible.{{Citation needed|date= December 2014}} Simple examples of ''Sitz im Leben'' include the classification of material into letters, poems of lament, [[parable]]s, [[psalms]], and songs. However, ''Sitz im Leben'' can also involve many other considerations; who the speaker of a passage was, his role in life, the nature of his audience, and so on.{{Citation needed|date= December 2014}} Taken out of its original [[Context principle|context]], the original meaning of a passage is often lost. So for example, a psalm may have its ''Sitz'' in the ritual of the temple cult, or as an artistic votive offering, or in the sense of injustice arising from a power structure in Jerusalem society, or lament in defeat. A major aim of [[hermeneutics]] ([[Contextualization (Bible translation)|contextualizing interpretation]]) is to uncover such things.{{Citation needed|date= December 2014}}

The term is also used to describe the contextual interpretation of archaeological artefacts and ancient sites. Only through examining the historical context can one properly interpret them.

==Development==
Today the term is also used outside theological research, when it is needed to examine a text for its sociologically relevant aspects. For example: the ''Sitz im Leben'' of a [[counting rhyme]] like "[[eeny, meeny, miny, moe]]" is a group of children deciding among themselves who will play in a game; when the children chant the song, we know that they are choosing who will play, but if we are unaware of this context, the rhyme appears merely to be nonsense about toes.{{Citation needed|date= December 2014}}

In [[linguistics]] the ''Sitz im Leben'' is determined by the text [[pragmatics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medienkultur und Medienlinguistik.

'''''The Gong Show Movie''''' is a 1980 American [[comedy film]] starring, written and directed by [[Chuck Barris]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=The Gong Show Movie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/93553/The-Gong-Show-Movie/overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film shows a fictional week in the life of [[Chuck Barris]] as the host and creator of ''[[The Gong Show]]'', through a series of outrageous competitors, stressful situations, a nervous breakdown (which compels him to run away and hide in the desert) and other comic hijinks in his life and work on the TV show. Among the highlights included a group of men dressed as a [[Roman Catholic]] priest and three nuns [[lip-synching]] [[Tom Lehrer]]'s song "The Vatican Rag", a man blowing out a candle with [[flatulence]], and the uncensored version of [[Jaye P.

'''''The Porcupine''''' is a short novel by [[Julian Barnes]] originally published in [[1991 in literature|1992]]. Before its British release date the book was first published earlier that year in Bulgarian, with the title ''Бодливо свинче'' (Bodlivo Svinche) by Obsidian of [[Sofia]].

==Synopsis==
Set in a [[post-communism|post-communist]] fictional country, likely based on [[Bulgaria]], the novel concerns the trial of Stoyo Petkanov, a character judged to be loosely based on [[Todor Zhivkov]], the former communist leader of Bulgaria. As the newly appointed Prosecutor General attempts to ensnare the former dictator with his own totalitarian laws, Petkanov springs a few unwelcome surprises on the court by conducting a formidable defense.

''[[The Times]]'' described the book as 'Superbly humane in its moral concerns...an excellent novel'.
