'''Academic art''', or '''academicism''' or '''academism''', is a style of [[painting]], [[sculpture]], and [[architecture]] produced under the influence of European [[academies of art]].  Specifically, academic art is the art and artists influenced by the standards of the French [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]], which was practiced under the movements of [[Neoclassicism]] and [[Romanticism]], and the art that followed these two movements in the attempt to synthesize both of their styles, and which is best reflected by the paintings of [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], [[Thomas Couture]], and [[Hans Makart]]. In this context it is often called "academism", "academicism", "[[L'art pompier|art pompier]]" (pejoratively), and "eclecticism", and sometimes linked with "[[historicism (art)|historicism]]" and "[[syncretism]]".

== The academies in history ==
The first academy of art was founded in [[Florence]] in Italy by [[Cosimo I de' Medici]], on 13 January 1563, under the influence of the architect [[Giorgio Vasari]] who called it the [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno|''Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno'']] (Academy and Company for the Arts of Drawing) as it was divided in two different operative branches. While the Company was a kind of corporation which every working artist in Tuscany could join, the Academy comprised only the most eminent artistic personalities of Cosimo's court, and had the task of supervising the whole artistic production of the medicean state. In this medicean institution students learned the "arti del disegno" (a term coined by Vasari) and heard lectures on [[anatomy]] and [[geometry]]. Another academy, the [[Accademia di San Luca]] (named after the patron saint of painters, [[St. Luke]]), was founded about a decade later in [[Rome]]. The Accademia di San Luca served an educational function and was more concerned with [[art theory]] than the Florentine one. In 1582 [[Annibale Carracci]] opened his very influential ''Academy of Desiderosi'' in [[Bologna]] without official support; in some ways this was more like a traditional artist's workshop, but that he felt the need to label it as an "academy" demonstrates the attraction of the idea at the time.

Accademia di San Luca later served as the model for the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]] founded in [[France]] in 1648, and which later became the [[Académie des beaux-arts]]. The Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture was founded in an effort to distinguish artists "who were gentlemen practicing a liberal art" from craftsmen, who were engaged in manual labor. This emphasis on the intellectual component of artmaking had a considerable impact on the subjects and styles of academic art.

After the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture was reorganized in 1661 by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] whose aim was to control all the artistic activity in France, a controversy occurred among the members that dominated artistic attitudes for the rest of the century. This "battle of styles" was a conflict over whether [[Peter Paul Rubens]] or [[Nicolas Poussin]] was a suitable model to follow. Followers of Poussin, called "poussinistes", argued that line (disegno) should dominate art, because of its appeal to the intellect, while followers of Rubens, called "rubenistes", argued that color (colore) should dominate art, because of its appeal to emotion.

The debate was revived in the early 19th century, under the movements of [[Neoclassicism]] typified by the artwork of [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], and [[Romanticism]] typified by the artwork of [[Eugène Delacroix]]. Debates also occurred over whether it was better to learn art by looking at nature, or to learn by looking at the artistic masters of the past.

Academies using the French model formed throughout Europe, and imitated the teachings and styles of the French Académie. In [[England]], this was the [[Royal Academy]]. The [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] founded in 1754, may be taken as a successful example in a smaller country, which achieved its aim of producing a national school and reducing the reliance on imported artists. The painters of the [[Danish Golden Age]] of roughly 1800-1850 were nearly all trained there, and many returned to teach and the history of the [[art of Denmark]] is much less marked by tension between academic art and other styles than is the case in other countries.

One effect of the move to academies was to make training more difficult for [[women artists]], who were excluded from most academies until the last half of the 19th century (1861 for the Royal Academy). This was partly because of concerns over the impropriety presented by nudity. Special arrangements were often made for female students until the 20th century.

== Development of the academic style ==
Since the onset of the poussiniste-rubeniste debate, many artists worked between the two styles. In the 19th century, in the revived form of the debate, the attention and the aims of the art world became to synthesize the line of [[Neoclassicism]] with the color of [[Romanticism]]. One artist after another was claimed by critics to have achieved the synthesis, among them [[Théodore Chassériau]], [[Ary Scheffer]], [[Francesco Hayez]], [[Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps]], and [[Thomas Couture]]. [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], a later academic artist, commented that the trick to being a good painter is seeing "color and line as the same thing".
Thomas Couture promoted the same idea in a book he authored on art method &amp;mdash; arguing that whenever one said a painting had better color or better line it was nonsense, because whenever color appeared brilliant it depended on line to convey it, and vice versa; and that color was really a way to talk about the "value" of form.

Another development during this period included adopting historical styles in order to show the era in history that the painting depicted, called [[historicism (art)|historicism]]. This is best seen in the work of Baron [[Jan August Hendrik Leys]], a later influence on [[James Tissot]]. It's also seen in the development of the [[Neo-Grec]] style. Historicism is also meant to refer to the belief and practice associated with academic art that one should incorporate and conciliate the innovations of different traditions of art from the past.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dusk (Bouguereau).jpg|thumb|left|''Evening''. [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], 1863.]]  --&gt;
The art world also grew to give increasing focus on [[allegory]] in art. Theories of the importance of both line and color asserted that through these elements an artist exerts control over the medium to create psychological effects, in which themes, emotions, and ideas can be represented. As artists attempted to synthesize these theories in practice, the attention on the artwork as an allegorical or figurative vehicle was emphasized. It was held that the representations in painting and sculpture should evoke [[Platonic form]]s, or ideals, where behind ordinary depictions one would glimpse something abstract, some eternal truth. Hence, [[John Keats|Keats']] famous musing "Beauty is truth, truth beauty". The paintings were desired to be an "idée", a full and complete idea. [[Adolphe William Bouguereau|Bouguereau]] is known to have said that he wouldn't paint "a war", but would paint "War". Many paintings by academic artists are simple nature allegories with titles like ''Dawn'', ''Dusk'', ''Seeing'', and ''Tasting'', where these ideas are personified by a single nude figure, composed in such a way as to bring out the essence of the idea.

The trend in art was also towards greater [[idealism (arts)|idealism]], which is contrary to [[realism (arts)|realism]], in that the figures depicted were made simpler and more abstract—idealized—in order to be able to represent the ideals they stood in for. This would involve both generalizing forms seen in nature, and subordinating them to the unity and theme of the artwork.

Because history and mythology were considered as plays or [[dialectic]]s of ideas, a fertile ground for important allegory, using themes from these subjects was considered the most serious form of painting. A [[hierarchy of genres]], originally created in the 17th century, was valued, where [[history painting]]—classical, religious, mythological, literary, and allegorical subjects—was placed at the top, next [[Genre works|genre painting]], then [[portrait]]ure, [[still-life]], and [[Landscape art|landscape]]. History painting was also known as the "grande genre". Paintings of [[Hans Makart]] are often larger than life historical dramas, and he combined this with a [[historicism (art)|historicism]] in decoration to dominate the style of 19th century [[Vienna]] culture. [[Paul Delaroche]] is a typifying example of French history painting.

All of these trends were influenced by the theories of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], who held that history was a dialectic of competing ideas, which eventually resolved in synthesis.

Towards the end of the 19th century, academic art had saturated European society. Exhibitions were held often, and the most popular exhibition was the [[Paris Salon]] and beginning in 1903, the [[Salon d'Automne]]. These [[Salon (gathering)#Public salons|salons]] were sensational events that attracted crowds of visitors, both native and foreign. As much a social affair as an artistic one, 50,000 people might visit on a single Sunday, and as many as 500,000 could see the exhibition during its two-month run. Thousands of pictures were displayed, hung from just below eye level all the way up to the ceiling in a manner now known as "Salon style". A successful showing at the salon was a seal of approval for an artist, making his work saleable to the growing ranks of private collectors. [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau|Bouguereau]], [[Alexandre Cabanel]] and [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] were leading figures of this art world.

During the reign of academic art, the paintings of the [[Rococo]] era, previously held in low favor, were revived to popularity, and themes often used in Rococo art such as [[Eros (god)|Eros]] and [[Psyche (mortal)|Psyche]] were popular again. The academic art world also idolized [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]], for the [[idealism (art)|ideality]] of his work, in fact preferring him over [[Michelangelo]].

Academic [[Art in Poland]] flourished under [[Jan Matejko]], who established the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|Kraków Academy of Fine Arts]]. Many of these works can be seen in the
[[Sukiennice Museum|Gallery of 19th-Century Polish Art at Sukiennice]] in [[Kraków]].

Academic art not only held influence in Europe and the United States, but also extended its influence to other Western countries. This was especially true for [[Latin America]]n nations, which, because their revolutions were modeled on the [[French Revolution]], sought to emulate French culture. An example of a Latin American academic artist is [[Ángel Zárraga]] of [[Mexico]].

== Academic training ==
[[File:École des beaux-arts (from the live).jpg|thumb|315px|''Students painting "from life" at the École''. Photographed late 1800s.]]

Young artists spent four years in rigorous training. In France, only students who passed an exam and carried a letter of reference from a noted professor of art were accepted at the academy's school, the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. Drawings and paintings of the nude, called "académies", were the basic building blocks of academic art and the procedure for learning to make them was clearly defined. First, students copied prints after classical sculptures, becoming familiar with the principles of contour, light, and shade. The copy was believed crucial to the academic education; from copying works of past artists one would assimilate their methods of art making. To advance to the next step, and every successive one, students presented drawings for evaluation.
[[File:Sykes-demos.JPG|thumb|left|150px|''Demosthenes at the Seashore'', a Royal Academy prize winning drawing, 1888.]]
If approved, they would then draw from plaster casts of famous classical sculptures. Only after acquiring these skills were artists permitted entrance to classes in which a live model posed. Painting was not taught at the École des Beaux-Arts until after 1863. To learn to paint with a brush, the student first had to demonstrate proficiency in drawing, which was considered the foundation of academic painting. Only then could the pupil join the studio of an academician and learn how to paint. Throughout the entire process, competitions with a predetermined subject and a specific allotted period of time measured each students' progress.

The most famous art competition for students was the [[Prix de Rome]]. The winner of the Prix de Rome was awarded a fellowship to study at the Académie française's [[French Academy in Rome|school at the Villa Medici]] in [[Rome]] for up to five years. To compete, an artist had to be of French nationality, male, under 30 years of age, and single. He had to have met the entrance requirements of the École and have the support of a well-known art teacher. The competition was grueling, involving several stages before the final one, in which 10 competitors were sequestered in studios for 72 days to paint their final history paintings. The winner was essentially assured a successful professional career.

As noted, a successful showing at the Salon was a seal of approval for an artist. Artists petitioned the hanging committee for optimal placement "on the line," or at eye level. After the exhibition opened, artists complained if their works were "skyed," or hung too high. The ultimate achievement for the professional artist was election to membership in the Académie française and the right to be known as an academician.

== Criticism and legacy ==
[[File:This Year Venuses Again (Daumier).jpg|thumb|241px|[[Caricature]] (French [[bourgeoisie]]): ''This Year Venuses Again… Always Venuses!''. [[Honoré Daumier]], No. 2 from series in ''Le Charivati'', 1864.]]

Academic art was first criticized for its use of [[idealism (art)|idealism]], by [[realism (arts)|Realist]] artists such as [[Gustave Courbet]], as being based on idealistic clichés and representing mythical and legendary motives while contemporary social concerns were being ignored. Another criticism by Realists was the "[[Licked finish|false surface]]" of paintings—the objects depicted looked smooth, slick, and idealized—showing no real texture. The Realist [[Théodule Ribot]] worked against this by experimenting with rough, unfinished textures in his painting.

Stylistically, the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], who advocated quickly [[plein air|painting outdoors]] exactly what the eye sees and the hand puts down, criticized the finished and idealized painting style. Although academic painters began a painting by first making drawings and then painting [[oil paint|oil sketches]] of their subject, the high polish they gave to their drawings seemed to the Impressionists tantamount to a lie. After the oil sketch, the artist would produce the final painting with the academic "fini," changing the painting to meet stylistic standards and attempting to idealize the images and add perfect detail. Similarly, [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] is constructed geometrically on a flat surface and is not really the product of sight, Impressionists disavowed the devotion to mechanical techniques.

Realists and Impressionists also defied the placement of still-life and landscape at the bottom of the hierarchy of genres. It is important to note that most Realists and Impressionists and others among the early avant-garde who rebelled against academism were originally students in academic [[wikt:atelier|ateliers]]. [[Claude Monet]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Édouard Manet]], and even [[Henri Matisse]] were students under academic artists.

As [[modern art]] and its avant-garde gained more power, academic art was further denigrated, and seen as sentimental, clichéd, conservative, non-innovative, [[bourgeois]], and "styleless". The French referred derisively to the style of academic art as ''[[L'art Pompier]]'' (''pompier'' means "fireman") alluding to the paintings of [[Jacques-Louis David]] (who was held in esteem by the academy) which often depicted soldiers wearing fireman-like helmets. The paintings were called "grandes machines" which were said to have manufactured false emotion through contrivances and tricks.

This denigration of academic art reached its peak through the writings of art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] who stated that all academic art is "[[kitsch]]". Other artists, such as the [[Symbolist painters]] and some of the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]], were kinder to the tradition{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. As painters who sought to bring imaginary vistas to life, these artists were more willing to learn from a strongly representational tradition. Once the tradition had come to be looked on as old-fashioned, the [[allegory|allegorical]] nudes and theatrically posed figures struck some viewers as bizarre and dreamlike.

With the goals of [[Postmodernism]] in giving a fuller, more sociological and pluralistic account of history, academic art has been brought back into history books and discussion. Nevertheless, since the early 1990s, academic art has experienced a limited resurgence through the [[Classical Realism|Classical Realist]] [[Atelier Method|atelier]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Panero, James: "The New Old School", ''The New Criterion'', Volume 25, September 2006, page 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the art is gaining a broader appreciation by the public at large, and whereas academic paintings once would only fetch a few hundreds of dollars in auctions, some now fetch millions.

'''Alpine lakes''' are classified as [[lake]]s or [[reservoir]]s at high altitudes, usually starting around 5,000 feet (1524 metres) in elevation above sea level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=Henry B.|last2=Marsh|first2=C.

Alpine lakes are usually clearer than lakes at lower elevations due to the colder water which decreases the speed and amount of [[algae]] and [[moss]] growth in the water.  Often these lakes are surrounded by varieties of [[pine tree]]s, [[aspen]]s, and other high altitude trees.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

It serves graphic design professionals, managers, educators and students. Created in 1996 by an Act of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] (Bill Pr56),&lt;ref name="Bill Pr56"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Office of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario:1523 ROYAL ASSENT / SANCTION ROYALE|author=[http://hansardindex.ontla.on.ca/hansardeissue/36-1/l064.htm  '''Bill Pr56, An Act respecting the Association of Registered Graphic Designers of Ontario]|date=25 April 1996|journal=online}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Association is Canada's only accredited body of graphic designers with a legislated title&lt;ref name=RGD-founders/&gt; and the second such accredited body of graphic designers in the world. RGD certifies graphic designers and promotes knowledge sharing, continuous learning, research, advocacy and mentorship.

==Advocacy==
RGD works to establish professional standards and innovative thinking within the graphic design industry. The association assumes an advocacy role for best practices for both graphic designers and the clients they work with. They focus on issues such as spec work and crowdsourcing, accessibility, sustainability, salaries and billing practices, pro bono work and internship guidelines.

RGD advocacy initiatives include:
* Supporting, defending and maintaining policies
* Promoting measures that broadly benefit members and the industry
* Increasing public awareness and disseminating information about industry best practices and the value of working with a Registered Graphic Designer (RGD)
* Arguing in favour of a new idea
* Speaking out on issues of concern
* Mediating, coordinating, clarifying and advancing a particular point of view
* Intervening with others on behalf of the profession

==History==
In 1956, Toronto-based designers Frank Davies, John Gibson, Frank Newfeld and Sam Smart formed the Society of Typographic Designers of Canada (TDC).&lt;ref name=RGD-founders&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rgd.ca/about/founders.php |title=Founders |author=Association of Registered Graphic Designers |accessdate=July 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702230050/http://www.rgd.ca/about/founders.php |archive-date=2014-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://modern-canada.blogspot.ca/2011/12/graphic-art-and-design-robert-stacey.html |title=Graphic Art and Design / Robert Stacey |type=Weblog post |author=Duncan |website=Modern Canada |accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TDC was later renamed the [[Society of Graphic Designers of Canada]] (GDC) to reflect the wider interests of its members.

By 1984 many other design disciplines such as Architecture and Interior Design had been given Acts in Provincial Legislatures so that their respective associations could govern and grant their members exclusive professional designations. RGD's founders recognized the need to align Graphic Design with other design professionals. To ensure Graphic Design could also advance as an acknowledged profession the Association's founders decided to incorporate the Association of Registered Graphic Designers (RGD).

On April 25, 1996 Bill Pr56&lt;ref name="Bill Pr56"/&gt; was passed and Royal Assent was given to an Act Respecting The Association of Registered Graphic Designers by the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. Sponsored by Mrs. [[Margaret Marland]], Member of Provincial Parliament and signed by the Honourable [[Hal Jackman]] C.M., O.Ont., O.ST.J., B.A., L.L.B., L.L.D., Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Ontario.

In 1999 a separate Examination Board was established to administer the Registered Graphic Designers Qualification Examination, now referred to as the [http://www.rgd.ca/rgd-certification.php Certification Process for RGD].

== Membership ==
In order to obtain the Registered Graphic Designer (RGD) designation, designers must complete go through a Certification Process that includes an application to determine eligibility, a multiple-choice online test, and a virtual portfolio interview. The RGD designation signifies knowledge, experience and ethical practice, guaranteeing that a designer is professionally competent in the areas of accessibility, business, design principles, research and ethics.

RGD offers various forms of membership for professional practitioners, managers, educators and students in graphic design, and for persons in allied professions.

==Conferences==
RGD organizes three annual conferences: a two-day design conference called [http://designthinkers.com DesignThinkers],&lt;ref name=RGD-dt&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://designthinkers.com/ |title=DesignThinkers Conference  }}&lt;/ref&gt; a one-day career development conference for students and emerging designers called [http://www.rgd.ca/events-and-programs/creative-directions Creative Directions], and a one-day Design Educators Conference.&lt;ref name=RGD-de&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.designthinkers.com/News/First-Annual-Design-Educators-Conference-is-a-Succ.aspx |title=First annual Design Educators Conference a success |date=December 2, 2013 |author=Association of Registered Graphic Designers |accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Birmingham Group''', sometimes called the '''Birmingham School''',{{sfn|Crawford|1984|p=28}} was an informal collective of [[painters]] and [[Artisan|craftsmen]] associated with the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], that worked in [[Birmingham]], [[England]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. All of its members studied or taught at the [[Birmingham School of Art]] after the reorganisation of its teaching methods by [[Edward R. Taylor]] in the 1880s, and it was the School that formed the group's primary focus.{{sfn|Crawford|1984|pp=28-30}} Members of the group also overlapped with other more formal organisations, including the [[Birmingham Guild of Handicraft]], the [[Ruskin Pottery]] and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts]].{{sfn|Crawford|1984|pp=30-32}}

The Group formed one of the last outposts of late [[Romanticism]] in the visual arts, and an important link between the last of the [[Pre-Raphaelites]] and the new Slade [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]].

==History==
[[File:BirminghamBIADFineArtMargaretStreet.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Birmingham School of Art]]]]
They began to form in an informal manner in the 1890s. Many were later to become teachers in Birmingham (especially the great [[Birmingham Municipal School of Art]] under [[Edward R. Taylor]]), and this meant that the [[Edward Burne-Jones]] style influenced all those who studied at the Birmingham art schools.  Many were also heavily influenced by the ideas and practices of [[John Ruskin]] and [[William Morris]], and had indeed personally known those men.  Several had undertaken work for the [[Kelmscott Press]], with [[Charles March Gere]] producing the famous frontispiece to ''[[News from Nowhere]]''. Many, unable to support themselves only through their art, also became fine crafts makers as well as teachers.

There was initially no formal membership, but during the 1930s they were known to have had a membership secretary.

Some of their members later became part of the [[Birmingham Surrealists]] group of artists, thus carrying to English Surrealism the rich vein of Romantic concern with emotional states in pictures, with myth and fantasy, with visions, and with a "natural supernaturalist" experience conveyed through art. The Birmingham Surrealists had made contact with the London Surrealist Group around 1940 and ex Birmingham Group members such as Emmy Bridgwater exhibited at the International Surrealist show in Paris in 1947. (See: Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery, ''Surrealism in Birmingham: 1935–1954'' (2001).

The Fine Art Society held an extensive exhibition of Birmingham Group works in 1969. The galleries of the Birmingham Group's works formed a keystone of the major ''The Last Romantics'' exhibition at the Barbican in 1989.

Backwards time travel would allow for causal loops involving events, information, people or objects whose histories form a closed loop, and thus seem to "come from nowhere."&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; The notion of objects or information which are "self-existing" in this way is often viewed as paradoxical,&lt;ref name="Lobo" /&gt; with several authors referring to a causal loop involving information or objects without origin as a  ''bootstrap paradox'',&lt;ref name="Everett"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Everett|first1=Allen|last2=Roman|first2=Thomas|title=Time Travel and Warp Drives|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-22498-5|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dm5xt_XbFyoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA136 136–139]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Visser|first=Matt|title=Lorentzian Wormholes: From Einstein to Hawking|date=1996|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=1-56396-653-0|p=213}} "A second class of logical paradoxes associated with time travel are the bootstrap paradoxes related to information (or objects, or even people?) being created from nothing."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klosterman"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv|last1=Klosterman |first1=Chuck |title=Eating the Dinosaur |date=2009 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=9781439168486|edition=1st Scribner hardcover|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZurDFJtAWwC&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;pg=PA60 60–62]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toomey2012"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Toomey|first=David|title=The New Time Travelers|date=2012|publisher=W.

An example of a causal loop paradox involving information is given by Everett: suppose a time traveler copies a mathematical proof from a textbook, then travels back in time to meet the mathematician who first published the proof, at a date prior to publication, and allows the mathematician to simply copy the proof. In this case, the information in the proof has no origin.&lt;ref name="Everett"/&gt; A similar example is given in the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' of a time-traveler who copies Beethoven's music from the future and publishes it in Beethoven's time in Beethoven's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|last=Holmes|first=Jonathan|work=Radio Times|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-10/doctor-who-what-is-the-bootstrap-paradox|title=Doctor Who: what is the Bootstrap Paradox?|date=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everett gives the movie ''[[Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time]]'' as an example involving an object with no origin: an old woman gives a watch to a playwright who later travels back in time and meets the same woman when she was young, and gives her the same watch that she will later give to him.&lt;ref name="Everett" /&gt;

Krasnikov writes that these bootstrap paradoxes - information or an object looping through time - are the same; the primary apparent paradox is a physical system evolving into a state in a way that is not governed by its laws.&lt;ref name="Krasnikov2001"&gt;{{cite|last=Krasnikov|first=S.|year=2001|title=The time travel paradox|journal=Phys.

A 1992 paper by physicists Andrei Lossev and [[Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov|Igor Novikov]] labeled such items without origin as ''Jinn'', with the singular term ''Jinnee''.&lt;ref name="Lossev1992"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Lossev|first=Andrei |last2=Novikov|first2=Igor|date=15 May 1992|title=The Jinn of the time machine: non-trivial self-consistent solutions|journal=Class.

The term ''predestination paradox'' is used in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise to mean "a time loop in which a time traveler who has gone into the past causes an event that ultimately causes the original future version of the person to go back into the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Okuda|first1=Michael|last2=Okuda|first2=Denise|title=The Star Trek Encyclopedia|date=1999|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-53609-5|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the phrase was created for a sequence in a 1996 episode of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' titled "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry J.|last2=Hutzel|first2=Gary|title=Star Trek: The Magic of Tribbles|date=2001|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-7434-4623-2|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W6bvoGUg7G8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA31 31]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the phrase had been used previously to refer to belief systems such as [[Calvinism]] and some forms of [[Marxism]] which encouraged followers to strive to produce certain outcomes while at the same time teaching that the outcomes were predetermined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Daniels|first=Robert V.|date=May–June 1960|title=Soviet Power and Marxist Determinism|journal=Problems of Communism|volume=9|p=[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015059418874;view=1up;seq=159 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smeenk and Morgenstern use the term "predestination paradox" to refer specifically to situations in which a time traveler goes back in time to try to prevent some event in the past, but ends up helping to cause that same event.&lt;ref name="smeenk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morgenstern"&gt;{{cite|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Research/TechReports/TR2013-950/TR2013-950.pdf |title=Foundations of a Formal Theory of Time Travel |last=Morgenstern|first=Leora|year=2010|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-fulfilling prophecy==
A [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] may be a form of causality loop, only when the prophecy can be said to be ''truly'' known to occur, since only then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. Otherwise, it would be a simple case of events in the past causing events in the future. [[Predestination]] does not necessarily involve a [[supernatural]] power, and could be the result of other "infallible foreknowledge" mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Craig|first=William Lane|year=1987 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/newcomb.html |title=Divine Foreknowledge and Newcomb's Paradox |journal=Philosophia |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=331–350 |doi=10.1007/BF02455055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in [[Newcomb's paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dummett|first=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|isbn13=9780198240112|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pp=356, 370–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable fictional example of a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in classical play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which [[Oedipus]] becomes the king of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], whilst in the process unwittingly fulfills a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother. The prophecy itself serves as the impetus for his actions, and thus it is self-fulfilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dodds|first=E.R.|year=1966|title=Greece &amp; Rome}} 2nd Ser., Vol. 13, No. 1, pp. 37–49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Popper|first1=Karl|title=Unended Quest: An Intellectual Autobiography|date=1985|publisher=Open Court|location=La Salle, Ill.|isbn=978-0-87548-343-6|edition=Rev.|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' heavily deals with themes of predestination and the [[Cassandra (metaphor)|Cassandra complex]], where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he can't change the past.&lt;ref name="Klosterman" /&gt;

''Evolution of the Universe'', p. 169: "The close of time curves does not necessarily imply a violation of causality, since the events along such a closed line may be all 'self-adjusted'—they all affect one another through the closed cycle and follow one another in a self-consistent way."&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1990 paper by Novikov and several others, "Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves",&lt;ref name="Friedman1990" /&gt; the authors suggested the ''principle of self-consistency,'' which states that ''the only solutions to the laws of physics that can occur locally in the real Universe are those which are globally self-consistent.'' The authors later concluded that time travel need not lead to unresolvable paradoxes, regardless of what type of object was sent to the past.&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt;

Physicist [[Joseph Polchinski]] argued that one could avoid questions of free will by considering a potentially paradoxical situation involving a [[billiard ball]] sent back in time. In this situation, the ball is fired into a [[wormhole]] at an angle such that, if it continues along its course, it will exit in the past at just the right angle to hit its earlier self, knocking it off course, which would stop it from entering the wormhole in the first place. Thorne referred to this problem as "Polchinski's paradox".&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt; Two students at Caltech, Fernando Echeverria and Gunnar Klinkhammer, went on to find a solution that avoided any inconsistencies. In the revised scenario, the ball would emerge from the future at a different angle than the one that had generated the paradox, and delivers its past self a glancing blow instead of knocking it completely away from the wormhole. This blow changes its trajectory by just the right degree, meaning it will travel back in time with the angle required to deliver its younger self the necessary glancing blow. Echeverria and Klinkhammer actually found that there was more than one self-consistent solution, with slightly different angles for the glancing blow in each case. Later analysis by Thorne and [[Robert Forward]] showed that for certain initial trajectories of the billiard ball, there could actually be an infinite number of self-consistent solutions.&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt;

Echeverria, Klinkhammer and Thorne published a paper discussing these results in 1991;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref={{harvid|Echeverria|1991}}| first=Fernando | last=Echeverria |author2=Gunnar Klinkhammer |author3=Kip Thorne | url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/6469/ | title=Billiard balls in wormhole spacetimes with closed timelike curves: Classical theory | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 44 | year=1991 | issue=4 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.44.1077 | pages=1077|bibcode = 1991PhRvD..44.1077E }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, they reported that they had tried to see if they could find ''any'' initial conditions for the billiard ball for which there were no self-consistent extensions, but were unable to do so. Thus it is plausible that there exist self-consistent extensions for every possible initial trajectory, although this has not been proven.&lt;ref name="Earman1995187188"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv| last = Earman | first = John | title = Bangs, Crunches, Whimpers, and Shrieks: Singularities and Acausalities in Relativistic Spacetimes | publisher = Oxford University Press |year= 1995 | isbn = 0-19-509591-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|184}} The lack of constraints on initial conditions only applies to spacetime outside of the chronology-violating region of spacetime; the constraints on the chronology-violating region might prove to be paradoxical, but this is not yet known.&lt;ref name="Earman1995187188" /&gt;{{Rp|187–188}}

Novikov's views are not widely accepted. Visser views causal loops and Novikov's self-consistency principle as an ad hoc solution, and supposes that there are far more damaging implications of time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv| last = Nahin | first =Paul J. | title = Time Machines: Time Travel in Physics, Metaphysics, and Science Fiction | publisher =American Institute of Physics |year= 1999 | isbn = 0-387-98571-9|pp=345–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krasnikov similarly finds no inherent fault in causal loops, but finds other problems with time travel in general relativity.&lt;ref name="Krasnikov2001" /&gt;{{Rp|14–16}}

==Quantum computation with negative delay==
Physicist [[David Deutsch]] shows in a 1991 paper that quantum computation with a negative delay&amp;mdash;backwards time travel&amp;mdash;could solve NP problems in [[Time complexity#Polynomial time|polynomial time]],&lt;ref name="Deutsch1991"&gt;{{cite journal | first=David | last=Deutsch | url= http://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197 | title= Quantum mechanics near closed timelike lines | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 44 | issue = 10 | year=1991 | doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197 | pages=3197–3217 | bibcode=1991PhRvD..44.3197D}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Scott Aaronson]] later extended this result to show that the model could also be used to solve [[PSPACE]] problems in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Scientific American|date=March 2008|title=The Limits of Quantum Computers|pages=68–69|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/limitsqc-draft.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Scott | last=Aaronson |author2=John Watrous | url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/ctc.pdf | title=Closed Timelike Curves Make Quantum and Classical Computing Equivalent | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society A | volume = 465 | year=2009 | issue = 2102 | doi=10.1098/rspa.2008.0350 | pages=631–647 | bibcode=2009RSPSA.465..631A|arxiv = 0808.2669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch shows that quantum computation with a negative delay produces only self-consistent solutions, and the chronology-violating region imposes constraints that are not apparent through classical reasoning.&lt;ref name="Deutsch1991" /&gt; Researchers published in 2014 a simulation validating Deutsch's model with photons.&lt;ref name=RingbauerEtAl2014&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martin Ringbauer|author2=Matthew A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2455">The '''Center for American Archeology''', or '''CAA''', is an independent non-profit [[501(c)(3)]] research and education institution located in [[Kampsville]], [[Illinois]], [[United States|USA]], near the [[Illinois River]]. It is dedicated to the exploration of the culture of [[prehistoric]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and, to a lesser extent, the European settlers who supplanted them.

Founded on what is often referred to as the "[[Nile]] of [[North America]]," the region surrounding the confluence of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and the [[Illinois River|Illinois]] rivers, the Center for American Archeology specializes in [[North America]]n [[pre-Columbian]] cultures of the area.  Due to successive settlement along the rivers, the area is particularly rich in [[Woodland Period]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], especially those of the Middle Woodland [[Hopewell culture]], and later [[Mississippian culture]].  The Center has been associated with years of excavation at the [[Koster Site]] in [[Greene County, Illinois]].  Researchers have uncovered evidence of more than 7,000 years of human habitation, back to the Early [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] period (8000 BC to 1000 BC).  

The center is located about 90 minutes north of [[St. Louis]] and the [[Cahokia]] Mounds near [[Collinsville, Illinois]]. It uses the [[Kamp Store]] as the site of the CAA's Visitor’s Center and [[Museum]].  The early 1900s [[mercantile]] building is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The '''Center for Applied Linguistics''' ('''CAL''') is a private, nonprofit organization founded in 1959 and  headquartered in Washington, DC. CAL’s mission is to promote language learning and cultural understanding by serving as a trusted source for research, resources, and policy analysis. Through its work, CAL seeks solutions to issues involving language and culture as they relate to access and equity in education and society around the world. CAL’s President and Chief Executive Officer is Joel Gómez.

The organization carries out its mission by working in the fields of bilingual and dual language education, English as a second language, world languages education, language policy, assessment, immigrant and refugee integration, literacy dialect studies; and the education of linguistically and culturally diverse adults and children (Peterson, 2004). Staff members conduct research, design and develop language assessments and instructional materials, provide technical assistance and professional development, and disseminate information and resources related to language and culture.

==History==
At the close of the 1950s, issues of language diversity, interest in language policy, and the emergence of English as a world language created a demand for information about world languages and for expertise in linguistics and language training. In the United States, reactions to the launch of Sputnik and the continuation of the Cold War led to concern about the ability of U.S. schools to train students in mathematics, the sciences, and foreign languages. CAL was created in this environment of increased interest in language issues by [[Charles A. Ferguson|Dr. Charles A. Ferguson]], a pioneer in the field of applied linguistics. Through a grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] to the [[Modern Language Association]], CAL was established in 1959  to serve as a liaison between the academic world of linguistics, and the practical world of language education and language-related concerns (Spolsky, 1999; Troike, 2008). CAL's original mandate was to improve the teaching of English around the world; encourage the teaching and learning of less commonly taught languages; contribute new knowledge to the field by conducting language research to resolve social and educational problems; and serve as a clearinghouse for information collection, analysis, and dissemination and as a coordinating agency to bring together scholars and practitioners involved in language-related issues.

==Current activities==
Since its inception, CAL has played a leading role in conducting research on language use, language learning, and effective teaching methods, and translating research into practical applications to help language learners succeed (Christian, 2008; Berns, 2010). Among the populations that CAL serves are language educators of children and adults who are learning foreign languages and English as a second language; immigrants and refugees in the United States and the agencies that provide services for them; schools, school districts, and other educational institutions in need of curriculum development, professional development, and assessments; and policy makers who need information about language and culture to address the important issues of the day.

CAL's [http://www.cal.org/ website] provides detailed information about the organization and access to resources on a wide range of topics including

[http://www.cal.org/areas-of-impact/english-learners English Learners]: CAL works with educators and practitioners to help the growing number of students who speak English as a second language in the United States succeed in the classroom and the workplace.

[http://www.cal.org/areas-of-impact/world-languages World Languages Education]: Proficiency in languages other than English is critical in the global society. CAL provides resources to inform language education at all levels of instruction, from early language programs in elementary schools through graduate level programs for individuals seeking high levels of proficiency in a range of languages.

[http://www.cal.org/siop Sheltered Instruction]: CAL supports educators who are implementing sheltered instruction, an approach to teaching that promotes language development and content-area learning for students who are not yet proficient in the language of instruction.

[http://www.cal.org/areas-of-impact/english-learners/bilingual-and-dual-language-education Bilingual and Dual Language Education]: Proficiency in more than one language is a valuable skill to be cultivated and nurtured in schools and communities. CAL provides information and resources to support the development of bilingualism and the academic success of English language learners through programs that utilize their native language in instruction.
 
[http://www.cal.org/heritage/ Heritage and Community Languages]: The United States has a rich diversity of languages other than English that are spoken in communities around the country. CAL offers a rich set of resources about heritage and community languages.

[http://www.cal.org/areas-of-impact/immigrant-refugee-integration Immigrant and Refugee Integration]: Since the major influx of refugees from Southeast Asia in the 1970s, CAL has conducted programs in refugee integration and orientation, helping newcomers understand fundamental aspects of life in the United States while helping service providers and interested parties understand the rich cultures and likely resettlement needs of the new members of their communities.

[http://www.cal.org/areas-of-impact/testing-assessment Testing and Assessment]: CAL researches and develops assessments of language proficiency in English as a second language and foreign languages at all educational and proficiency levels. Specialists also examine the language and culture issues related to assessment of subject matter knowledge through a second language for English learners and design innovative approaches to addressing these concerns. CAL has been involved in the development of many tests, including the TOEFL. The TOEFL was originally developed at the Center for Applied Linguistics under the direction of Stanford University applied linguistics professor and CAL's first president Dr. Charles A. Ferguson.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_of_English_as_a_Foreign_Language&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.cal.org/areas-of-impact/language-planning-policy Language Planning and Policy]: CAL facilitates collaboration nationally and internationally among scholars and other stakeholders and is committed to making significant contributions to the dialogue and debate about language planning and policy with the goal of expanding language choices and widening the context within which language policy decisions are made. In particular, CAL is focusing on language in education planning as a means of promoting language acquisition and achieving greater equity of access to resources.

[http://www.cal.org/what-we-do/research Research]: CAL is involved in a variety of research projects that inform its mission, such as math, science, and language education for English learners, biliteracy development for Spanish-speaking students, effective approaches for developing high levels of language proficiency in English and other languages, and innovative methods for assessing math and science knowledge in English learners. Much of CAL’s grant and project work includes a substantial research component.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28668">'''Civil religion''', also referred to as a '''civic religion''',&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; is the implicit religious values of a nation, as expressed through public [[ritual]]s, symbols (such as the national flag), and ceremonies on sacred days and at sacred places (such as monuments, battlefields, or national cemeteries). It is distinct from churches, although church officials and ceremonies are sometimes incorporated into the practice of civil religion.{{sfn|Wimberley|Swatos|1998}} Countries described as having a civil religion include France,&lt;ref name=BaylacFrance/&gt; South Korea,&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; and the former Soviet Union.{{sfn|Tumarkin|1983}} As a concept, it originated in French [[political thought]] and became a major topic for U.S. [[sociologist]]s since its use by [[Robert Bellah]] in 1960.

==Origin of term==
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] coined the term in chapter 8, book 4 of ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (1762), to describe what he regarded as the moral and spiritual foundation essential for any modern society. For Rousseau, civil religion was intended simply as a form of social cement, helping to unify the [[State (polity)|state]] by providing it with sacred authority. In his book, [[Rousseau]] outlines the simple [[dogma]]s of the civil religion:
# [[deity]]
# [[afterlife]]
# the reward of [[virtue]] and the punishment of [[vice]]
# the exclusion of [[religious intolerance]]{{sfnm |1a1=Bellah |1y=1967 |2a1=Juergensmeyer |2y=2003 |2p=245 |3a1=Meyer-Dinkgrafe |3y=2004 |3p=30 |4a1=Shanks |4y=2000 |4p=29}}
The Italian historian [[Emilio Gentile]] has studied the roots and development of the concept and proposed a division of two types of religions of politics: a civil religion and a [[political religion]].{{sfn|Gentile|2006}}

==Sociology of religion==
[[File:National Cathedral.jpg|thumb|The [[Washington National Cathedral]] in [[Washington, DC]], is often used for state [[funeral]]s for political leaders.]]
In the [[sociology of religion]], '''civil religion''' is the [[folk religion]] of a [[nation]] or a [[politics|political]] [[culture]].{{dubious|date=October 2012}}{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Civil religion stands somewhat above folk religion in its social and political status, since by definition it suffuses an entire society, or at least a segment of a society; and is often practiced by [[leadership|leader]]s within that society.  On the other hand, it is somewhat less than an [[establishment of religion]], since established churches have official [[clergy]] and a relatively fixed and formal relationship with the government that establishes them. Civil religion is usually practiced by political leaders who are laypeople and whose leadership is not specifically spiritual.

===Examples===

Such civil religion encompasses such things as:{{sfn|Bellah|1992}}
*the invocation of God in political speeches and public monuments;
*the quotation of [[religious text]]s on public occasions by political leaders;
*the veneration of past political leaders;
*the use of the lives of these leaders to teach moral ideals;
*the veneration of veterans and casualties of a nation's wars;
*religious gatherings called by political leaders;
*the use of religious symbols on public buildings;
*the use of public buildings for worship;
*[[founding myth]]s and other [[national myth]]s
and similar religious or quasi-religious practices.

==Practical political philosophy==
[[File:Arc De Triomphe 2004.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Arc de Triomphe]]'' in [[Paris]] commemorates those who died in France's wars.]]

Professional commentators on political and social matters writing in newspapers and magazines sometimes use the term '''''civil religion''''' or '''''civic religion''''' to refer to [[ritual]] expressions of [[patriotism]] of a sort practiced in all countries, not always including religion in the conventional sense of the word.

Among such practices are the following:{{sfn|Bellah|1992}}
*crowds singing the national anthem at certain public gatherings;
*parades or display of the national flag on certain [[National Day|patriotic holidays]];
*reciting [[oath of allegiance|oaths of allegiance]] (like the pledges of allegiance found in countries such as the [[Pledge of Allegiance (Bahamas)|Bahamas]], [[Pledge of Allegiance to the Philippine Flag|the Philippines]], and [[Pledge of Allegiance (South Korea)|South Korea]]);
*ceremonies concomitant to the inauguration of a president or the coronation of a monarch;
*retelling exaggerated, one-sided, and simplified [[mythology|mythologized]] tales of [[List of national founders|national founders]] and other great leaders or great events (e.g., battles, mass migrations) in the past (in this connection, see also [[romantic nationalism]]);
*[[monument]]s commemorating great leaders of the past or historic events;
*monuments to dead soldiers or annual ceremonies to remember them;
*expressions of [[reverence (attitude)|reverence]] for the state, the predominant national racial/ethnic group,&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; the national constitution, or the monarch;
*expressions of solidarity with people perceived as being national kindred but residing in a foreign country or a foreign country perceived as being similar enough to the nation to warrant admiration and/or loyalty;&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;
*expressions of hatred towards another country or foreign ethnic group perceived as either currently being an enemy of the state and/or as having wronged and slighted the nation in the past;&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;
*public display of the coffin of a recently deceased political leader.

==Relation between the two conceptions==

These two conceptions (sociological and political) of '''civil religion''' substantially overlap. In Britain, where church and state are constitutionally joined, the monarch's coronation is an elaborate religious rite celebrated by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In France, secular ceremonies are separated from religious observances to a greater degree than in most countries. In the United States, a president being inaugurated is told by the Constitution to choose between saying [[oath of office|"I do solemnly swear..."]] (customarily followed by "so help me God", although those words are not Constitutionally required) and saying "I do solemnly affirm..." (in which latter case no mention of God would be expected).

==History==

===Prehistory and classical antiquity===
{{Disputed section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Bas relief from Arch of Marcus Aurelius showing sacrifice.jpg|thumb|The emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], his [[capite velato|head ritually covered]], conducts a public sacrifice at the Temple of Jupiter]]
Practically all the ancient and prehistoric reigns suffused politics with religion. Often the leaders, such as the [[Pharaoh]] or the [[Chinese Emperor]] were considered manifestations of a [[Divinity]]. Tribal world-view was often [[Pantheism|Pantheistic]], the tribe being an extension of its surrounding nature and the leaders having roles and symbols derived from the animal hierarchy and significant natural phenomena (such as storm).

The religion of the Athenian [[polis]] was a secular [[polytheism]] focused on the [[Olympian Gods]] and was celebrated in the civic festivals. Religion was a matter of state and the Athenian [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]] deliberated on matters of religion. Atheism and the introduction of foreign gods were forbidden in Athens and punishable by death. For example, the Athenian ecclesia charged that [[Socrates]] worshiped gods other than those sanctioned by the polis and condemned him to death.

Rome also had a civil religion, whose first Emperor [[Augustus]] officially attempted to revive the dutiful practice of classical [[paganism]]. [[Religion in Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] were essentially local in character; the [[Roman Empire]] attempted to unite its disparate territories by inculcating an ideal of Roman piety, and by a [[syncretism|syncretistic]] identifying of the gods of conquered territories with the Greek and Roman [[Greek mythology|pantheon]].  In this campaign, Augustus erected monuments such as the ''[[Ara Pacis]]'', the Altar of Peace, showing the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and his family worshiping the gods.  He also encouraged the publication of works such as [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid|Æneid]]'', which depicted "pious [[Aeneas|Æneas]]", the [[legend]]ary ancestor of [[Rome]], as a role model for Roman religiosity. Roman historians such as [[Livy]] told tales of early Romans as morally improving stories of military prowess and civic virtue. The Roman civil religion later became centered on the person of the Emperor through the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], the worship of the ''[[genius (mythology)|genius]]'' of the Emperor.{{sfn|O'Donovan|1996}}

===Rousseau and Durkheim===
The phrase ''civil religion'' was first discussed extensively by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his 1762 treatise ''The Social Contract''. Rousseau defined ''civil religion'' as a group of religious beliefs he believed to be universal, and which he believed governments had a right to uphold and maintain: belief in a deity; belief in an afterlife in which [[virtue]] is rewarded and vice punished; and belief in [[freedom of religion|religious tolerance]].  He said the dogmas of civil religion should be simple, few in number, and stated in precise words without interpretations or commentaries.{{sfn|Beiner|1993}} Beyond that, Rousseau affirmed that individuals' religious opinions should be beyond the reach of governments.  For Rousseau civil religion was to be constructed and imposed from the top down as an artificial source of civic virtue.{{sfn|Demerath|Williams|1985}}

Wallace studies [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), the French sociologist who analysed civil religion, especially in comparative terms, and stressed that the public schools are critical in implementing civil religion. Although he never used the term he laid great stress on the concept.{{sfn|Wallace|1977}}

==Examples==
===France===
Secular states in Europe by the late 19th century were building civil religion based on their recent histories. In France's case, Baylac argues, the French government:
{{quote|encouraged a veritable state religion, worshiping the flag and multiplying the national holidays and commemorative monuments.&amp;nbsp;... July 14 became a national holiday in 1882; the centennial of the French Revolution was celebrated in 1889. In Italy, the secular state multiplied the celebrations: State holidays, King and Queen's birthdays, pilgrimage of 1884 to the tomb of Victor-Emmanuel II. A patriotic ideology was created.&lt;ref name=BaylacFrance&gt;{{cite book |last=Baylac |first=M.-H. |year=1997 |title=Histoire 1ère |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher=Bordas |page=134}} Quoted in {{harvnb|Lindaman|Ward|2013|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===South Korea===
In contemporary South Korea, the predominating civil religion has been described as consisting of [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea|anti-Japanese sentiment]] coupled with a pan-[[Korean racial nationalism]].&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; This has been criticized by some scholars as being detrimental to South Korean national security as it encourages North Korean provocations against the country in the guise that South Koreans will not adequately defend their country's security as they feel a certain racial and ethnic solidarity with North Korea.&lt;ref name=BRMyers&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/war_college/what-north-korea-wants|title=What North Korea Wants|date=2017|first=Brian Reynolds|authorlink=Brian Reynolds Myers|last=Myers|publisher=Soundcloud|work=Reuters War College|quote=The South needs to retire the conventional civic religion here, which is anti-Japanese pan-Korean nationalism in favor of a collective identification of civic principles.|access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar argued that South Korea should retire this sort of racialized civil religion for one more rooted in civic principles, like was found in [[West Germany]] during the 20th century.&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;

===Soviet Union===
[[File:Dubna Lenin.JPG|thumb|Statue of Lenin at [[Dubna]], Russia, built in 1937; it is 25 metres tall]]
The Soviet Union made [[Marxism–Leninism]] into a civil religion, with sacred texts and [[List of statues of Vladimir Lenin|many statues of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin.]]{{sfn|Tumarkin|1983}} Stalin personally supervised the cult of Lenin and his own cult, which took advantage of the historic semi-religious adulation Russian peasants had shown toward the tsars.{{sfn|Plamper|2012}} The Lenin icons were put into storage when [[fall of communism|communism fell in 1991]]. The [[List of statues of Stalin|Stalin statues]] had been [[de-Stalinization|removed]] in the 1950s and mention of him was erased from encyclopedias and history books. However under [[Vladimir Putin]] in the 21st century the memory of Stalin has been partly rehabilitated in search of a strong leader who made the nation powerful.  For example, school textbooks were rewritten to portray "the mass terror of the Stalin years as essential to the country's rapid modernization in the face of growing German and Japanese military threats, and amid the inaction or duplicity of the Western democracies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Sherlock |first=Thomas |year=2011 |title=Confronting the Stalinist Past: The Politics of Memory in Russia |url=https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/twq11springsherlock.pdf |magazine=The Washington Quarterly |volume=34 |issue=2 |page=97 |issn=1530-9177 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225034518/https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/twq11springsherlock.pdf |archive-date=25 February 2018 |access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|American civil religion}}
Civil religion is an important component of public life in America, especially at the national level for its celebration of [[nationalism]]. Sociologists report that its "feast days" are [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], [[Veterans Day]], and [[Memorial Day]]. Its rituals include salutes to the flag and singing "[[God Bless America]]".{{sfn|Bruce|Yearley|2006|p=34}} Soldiers and veterans play a central role of standing ready to sacrifice their lives to preserve the nation. Bellah noted the veneration of veterans.{{sfn|Bellah|1992}} The historian Conrad Cherry called the Memorial Day ceremonies "a modern cult of the dead" and says that it "affirms the civil religious tenets."{{sfn|Wilsey|2015|p=24}}

====American Revolution====
{{Further|Commemoration of the American Revolution}}
The American Revolution was the main source of the civil religion that has shaped patriotism ever since. According to the sociologist Robert Bellah:
{{quote|Behind the civil religion at every point lie biblical archetypes: Exodus, Chosen People, Promised Land, New Jerusalem, and Sacrificial Death and Rebirth. But it is also genuinely American and genuinely new. It has its own prophets and its own martyrs, its own sacred events and sacred places, its own solemn rituals and symbols. It is concerned that America be a society as perfectly in accord with the will of God as men can make it, and a light to all nations.{{sfn|Bellah|1967}}}}

Albanese argues that the American Revolution was the main source of the non-denominational [[American civil religion]] that has shaped patriotism and the memory and meaning of the nation's birth ever since. Battles are not central (as they are for the Civil War) but rather certain events and people have been celebrated as icons of certain virtues (or vices). As historians have noted, the Revolution produced a Moses-like leader ([[George Washington]]), prophets ([[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Tom Paine]]) and martyrs ([[Boston Massacre]], [[Nathan Hale]]), as well as devils ([[Benedict Arnold]]), sacred places ([[Valley Forge]], [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill]]), rituals ([[Boston Tea Party]]), emblems ([[American flag|the new flag]]), sacred holidays ([[July 4]]) and a holy scripture whose every sentence is carefully studied and applied in current law cases (the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]).{{sfn|Albanese|1977}}

Although "God" is not mentioned in the [[Constitution of the United States of America]], mention is specifically made of "[[Deism#Deism in the United States|Nature's God]]" in the opening sentence of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].{{sfn|O'Donovan|1996}}

====Historiography====
[[File:Christian Flag etc Covenant Presbyterian Long Beach 20050213.jpg|thumb|The [[Christian flag]] displayed alongside the flag of the United States next to the pulpit in a church in California.  Note the eagle and cross finials on the flag poles.]]
In the 1960s and 1970s, scholars such as [[Robert N. Bellah]] and [[Martin E. Marty]] studied civil religion as a cultural phenomenon, attempting to identify the actual tenets of civil religion in the United States, or to study civil religion as a phenomenon of [[cultural anthropology]].  Within this American context, Marty wrote that Americans approved of "religion in general" without being particularly concerned about the content of that faith, and attempted to distinguish "priestly" and "prophetic" roles within the practice of American civil religion, which he preferred to call the ''public theology''.{{sfn|Marty|1989|p=295}} In the 1967 essay "Civil Religion in America", Bellah wrote that civil religion in its priestly sense is "an institutionalized collection of sacred beliefs about the American nation."  Bellah describes the prophetic role of civil religion as challenging "national self-worship" and calling for "the subordination of the nation to ethical principles that transcend it in terms of which it should be judged."{{sfn|Bellah|1967}} Bellah identified the [[American Revolution]], the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] as three decisive historical events that impacted the content and imagery of civil religion in the United States.

The application of the concept of civil religion to the United States was in large part the work of sociologist [[Robert Bellah]]. He identified an elaborate system of practices and beliefs arising from America's unique historic experience and religiosity. Civil religion in the US was originally Protestant but brought in Catholics and Jews after World War II. Having no association with any religious sect, Civil religion was used in the 1960s to justify civil rights legislation. Americans ever since the colonial era talk of their obligation both collective and individual to carry out God's will on earth. [[George Washington]] was a sort of high priest, and the documents of the [[Founding Fathers]] have been treated as almost sacred texts. With the Civil War, says Bellah, came a new theme of death, sacrifice and rebirth, as expressed through [[Memorial Day]] rituals. Unlike France, the American civil religion was never anticlerical or militantly secular.{{sfn|Bellah|1967}}

==Current issues==
This assertive civil religion of the United States is an occasional cause of political friction between the US and Europe, where the literally religious form of civil religion has largely faded away in recent decades. In the United States, civil religion is often invoked under the name of "[[Judeo-Christian ethics]]", a phrase originally intended to be maximally inclusive of the several religions practiced in the United States, assuming that these faiths all share the same values. Alvin J. Schmidt argues that since the 1700s, expressions of civil religion in the United States have shifted from a deistic to a polytheistic stance.{{sfn|Schmidt|2004}}

Some scholars have argued that the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] can be seen as a main [[totem]] of a national cult,&lt;ref&gt;Marvin and Ingle (1996). [http://www.asc.upenn.edu/USR/fcm/jaar.htm "Blood Sacrifice and the Nation: Revisiting Civil Religion"].&lt;/ref&gt; while others have argued that modern punishment is a form of civil religion.{{sfn|SpearIt|2013}} Arguing against mob violence and lynching, Abraham Lincoln declared in his 1838 Lyceum speech that the Constitution and the laws of the United States ought to become the "political religion" of each American.&lt;ref&gt;Address Before the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois January 27, 1838 [http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/lyceum.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, [[Forest management|forest manager]]s worldwide have been encouraged{{by whom|date=June 2018}} to allow dead trees and woody debris to remain in woodlands, [[biogeochemical cycle|recycling nutrients]] trapped in the wood and providing [[heterotrophic nutrition|food]] and [[habitat]] for a wide range of organisms, thereby improving [[biodiversity]]. The amount of coarse woody debris is considered{{by whom|date=June 2018}} an important criterion for the evaluation and restoration of temperate deciduous forest.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 1996"/&gt; Coarse woody debris is also important in wetlands, particularly in [[river delta|delta]]s where woody debris accumulates.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010. p. 225-227"/&gt;

Coarse woody debris comes from natural tree mortality, [[Plant pathology|disease]], and [[insect]]s, as well as catastrophic events such as [[wildfire|fires]], [[windthrow|storms]] and floods.

[[Ancient woodland|Ancient]], or [[old growth]], forest, with its dead trees and woody remains lying where they fell to feed new vegetation, constitutes the ideal woodland in terms of recycling and regeneration. In healthy [[temperate forest]]s, dead wood comprises up to thirty per cent of all woody [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. In recent British studies, woods managed for timber had between a third and a seventh less fallen debris than unmanaged woods that had been left undisturbed for many years, while in recently [[coppicing|coppiced]] woods the amount of CWD was almost zero.

In old growth [[Pseudotsuga menziesii|Douglas fir]] forests of the [[Pacific Northwest]] of [[North America]], CWD concentrations were found to be from 72 metric tons/hectare (64,000 pounds/acre) in drier sites to 174 t/ha (155,000&amp;nbsp;lb/acre) in moister sites.&lt;ref name=spies&gt;{{cite journal |title=Coarse Woody Debris in Douglas-Fir Forests of Western Oregon and Washington |first1=Thomas A. |last1=Spies |first2=Jerry F. |last2=Franklin |first3=Ted B. |last3=Thomas |journal=Ecology |volume=69 |issue=6 |pages=1689–1702 |doi=10.2307/1941147|date=December 1988|jstor=1941147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Forests of Australia|Australian native forests]] have mean CWD concentrations ranging from 19 t/ha (17,000&amp;nbsp;lb/acre) to 134 t/ha (120,000&amp;nbsp;lb/acre), depending on forest type.&lt;ref name=aust&gt;{{cite journal| last=Woldendorp| first=G.| last2=Keenan| first2=R.

===Nutrient cycling===
Coarse woody debris and its subsequent [[decomposition]] [[biogeochemical cycle|recycles nutrients]] that are essential for living organisms, such as [[carbon cycle|carbon]], [[nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]], [[potassium]], and [[phosphorus cycle|phosphorus]]. [[Saprotrophic nutrition|Saprotrophic]] [[fungi]] and [[detritivore]]s such as [[bacteria]] and [[insects]] directly consume dead wood, releasing nutrients by converting them into other forms of [[organic matter]] which may then be consumed by other organisms. However CWD itself is extremely scarce in physiologically important nutrients. To fulfill nutritional requirements of consumers, CWD must be first nutritionally enriched by transport of nutrients from outside of CWD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Filipiak|first=Michał|last2=Weiner|first2=January|date=2014-12-23|title=How to Make a Beetle Out of Wood: Multi-Elemental Stoichiometry of Wood Decay, Xylophagy and Fungivory|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115104|journal=PLOS One|volume=9|issue=12|pages=e115104|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0115104|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4275229|pmid=25536334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Filipiak|first=Michał|last2=Sobczyk|first2=Łukasz|last3=Weiner|first3=January|date=2016-04-09|title=Fungal Transformation of Tree Stumps into a Suitable Resource for Xylophagous Beetles via Changes in Elemental Ratios|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/7/2/13|journal=Insects|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=13|doi=10.3390/insects7020013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus CWD is important actor contributing to soil nutrients cycles. CWD, while itself not particularly rich in nitrogen, contributes nitrogen to the ecosystem by acting as a host for [[Symbiosis|nonsymbiotic]] free-living [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[Diazotroph|bacteria]].&lt;ref name=stevens&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/docs/Wp/Wp30.pdf| last=Stevens| first=Victoria| year=1997| title=The ecological role of coarse woody debris: an overview of the ecological importance of CWD in B.C. forests| publisher=Research Branch, B.C. Ministry of Forests| place=Victoria, B.C.| series=Working Paper 30/1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific studies show that coarse woody debris can be a significant contributor to [[biosequestration|biological]] [[carbon sequestration]]. Trees store atmospheric carbon in their wood using [[photosynthesis]]. Once the trees die, fungi and other saprotrophs transfer some of that carbon from CWD into the [[soil carbon|soil]]. This sequestration can continue in [[old-growth forest]]s for hundreds of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Science| date=23 November 2001| volume=294| number=5547| pages=1688–1691| doi=10.1126/science.1062962| title=Factors Controlling Long- and Short-Term Sequestration of Atmospheric CO2 in a Mid-latitude Forest| last=Barford |first=CC |last2=Wofsy |first2=SC | last3=Goulden| first3=ML| last4=Munger| first4=JW| last5=Pyle| first5=EH| last6=Urbanski| first6=SP| last7=Hutyra| first7=L| last8=Saleska| first8=SR| last9=Fitzjarrald| first9=D| last10=Moore| first10=K | pmid=11721047}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Nature| volume=455| pages=213–215| date=11 September 2008| doi=10.1038/nature07276| first=Sebastiaan |last=Luyssaert |first2=E. |last2=-Detlef Schulze |first3=Annett |last3=Börner |first4=Alexander |last4=Knohl |first5=Dominik |last5=Hessenmöller |first6=Beverly E. |last6=Law |first7=Philippe |last7=Ciais |first8=John |last8=Grace| title=Old-growth forests as global carbon sinks | pmid=18784722 | issue=7210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Habitat===
By providing both food and [[microhabitat]]s for many [[species]], coarse woody debris helps to maintain the [[biodiversity]] of forest ecosystems. Up to forty percent of all forest fauna is dependent on CWD. Studies in western North America showed that only five per cent of living trees consisted of living cells by volume, whereas in dead wood it was as high as forty percent by volume, mainly fungi and [[bacterium|bacteria]].&lt;ref name=tfl/&gt; Colonizing organisms that live on the remains of [[Cambium (botany)|cambium]] and [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] of dead trees aid decomposition and attract [[predation|predator]]s that prey on them and so continue the chain of metabolizing the biomass.

[[File:Yellow-eyed Ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii xanthoptica)01.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Ensatina eschscholtzii]]'', a species of salamander associated with CWD in western North America&lt;ref name=butts&gt;{{cite journal| title=Associations of Forest-Floor Vertebrates with Coarse Woody Debris in Managed Forests of Western Oregon| first=Sally R.| last=Butts| first2=William C.| last2=McComb| journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management| volume=64| number=1|date=January 2000| pages=95–104| doi=10.2307/3802978}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The list of organisms dependent on CWD for habitat or as a food source includes [[bacteria]], [[wood-decay fungus|fungi]], [[lichen]]s, [[moss]]es and other [[plant]]s, and in the animal kingdom, [[invertebrate]]s such as [[termite]]s, [[ant]]s, [[beetle]]s, and [[snail]]s,&lt;ref name=snail&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kappes| first=H.| year=2005| title=Influence Of Coarse Woody Debris On The Gastropod Community Of A Managed Calcareous Beech Forest In Western Europe| journal=[[Journal of Molluscan Studies]]| volume=71| number=2| pages=85–91| doi=10.1093/mollus/eyi011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[amphibian]]s such as [[salamander]]s,&lt;ref name=butts/&gt; [[reptile]]s such as the [[Anguis fragilis|slow-worm]], as well as [[bird]]s and small [[mammal]]s.  One third of all woodland birds live in the cavities of dead tree trunks. [[Woodpecker]]s, [[Tit (bird)|tit]]s, [[chickadee]]s, and [[owl]]s all live in dead trees, and [[grouse]] shelter behind woody debris.

Some plants use coarse woody debris as habitat.  [[Moss]]es and [[lichen]]s may cover logs, while ferns and trees may regenerate on the top of logs. Large fragments of CWD that provide such habitat for [[herb]]s, [[shrub]]s, and [[tree]]s are called [[nurse log]]s.&lt;ref name=stevens/&gt; CWD can also protect young plants from [[herbivory]] damage by acting as barriers to browsing animals. The persistence of coarse woody debris can shelter organisms during a large [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] to the ecosystem such as [[wildfire]] or [[logging]].

===Rivers and wetlands===
Fallen debris and trees in streams provide shelter for [[fish]], amphibians and mammals by modifying the flow of water and sediment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bilby | first1 = R. E. | last2 = Ward | first2 = J. | year = 1991 | title = Characteristics and function of large woody debris in streams draining old-growth, clear-cut, and 2nd-growth forests in southwestern Washington | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences | volume = 48 | issue = 12| pages = 2499–508 | doi=10.1139/f91-291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crook | first1 = D.

I. | year = 1999 | title = Relationships between riverine fish and woody debris: implications for lowland rivers | url = | journal = Marine and Freshwater Research | volume = 50 | issue = 8| pages = 941–53 | doi=10.1071/mf99072}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turtles of many species may also use coarse woody debris for basking.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 p. Figure 8.15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sternotherus|Musk turtles]] may lay their eggs under logs near wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst, C.H., R.W. Barbour, and J.E. Lovich. 1994. Turtles of the United States and Canada. Smithsonian Institution, Washington. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soil===
Coarse woody debris, particularly on slopes, stabilizes soils by slowing downslope movement of organic matter and mineral soil. Leaves and other debris collect behind CWD, allowing for decomposition to occur. [[Infiltration (hydrology)|Infiltration]] of precipitation is improved as well. During dry weather, CWD slows [[evapotranspiration|evaporation]] of soil moisture and provides damp microhabitats for moisture-sensitive organisms.&lt;ref name=stevens/&gt;

==Wildfire==
[[File:Coarse woody debris 6407.JPG|thumb|right|Coarse woody debris may contribute to the intensity of wildfire.]]
In [[fire ecology|fire-prone forest]]s, coarse woody debris can be a significant fuel during a [[wildfire]].  High amounts of fuels can lead to increased fire severity and size.  CWD may be managed to reduce fuel levels, particularly in forests where [[wildfire suppression|fire exclusion]] has resulted in the buildup of fuels. Reductions in CWD for fire safety should be balanced with the retention of CWD for habitat and other benefits.&lt;ref name=knapp05/&gt;  CWD is classified as 1000-hour fuel by fire managers, referring to the amount of time needed for the moisture level in the wood to react to the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=glossary/&gt;

==Regional examples==
[[File:Blera.fallax2.-.lindsey.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Blera fallax]]'', Belgium]]
In [[Glen Affric]], [[Scotland]], the ''Trees for Life'' group found the black tinder fungus beetle (''[[Bolitothorus reticulatus]]'') is dependent on a particular fungus (''[[Fomes fomentarius]]''), which itself grows only on dead [[birch]].  Another insect, the pine hoverfly (''[[Blera fallax]]''), requires rotting [[Scots Pine]] in order to reproduce.&lt;ref name=tfl&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.treesforlife.org.uk/forest/ecological/deadwood.html| title=Ecological Features of the Caledonian Forest - Dead Wood| publisher=Trees For Life| first=Dan| last=Puplett| accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[temperate deciduous forest]]s of Eastern North America, coarse woody debris provides habitat ranging from salamanders to ferns.  It is an important indicator for evaluating and restoring this type of forest.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 1996"/&gt;

In certain [[subtropical]] areas such as [[Australia]] where [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfire]] constitutes a major hazard, the amount of CWD left standing or lying is determined by what may be considered safe in the course of reasonable fire prevention. However, when fires do occur, invertebrates find shelter either within or beneath dead tree logs.

In Canada, [[bear]]s seek out dead tree logs to tear open and look for and feed on [[ant]]s and [[beetle]]s, a fact that has encouraged the authorities to reserve a sufficient amount of coarse woody debris for these purposes. In North America, too, CWD is often used as barriers to prevent [[Browsing (predation)|browsing]] [[deer]] and [[elk]] from damaging young trees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6576">'''Cultural contracts''' refer to the degree that cultural values are exchanged between groups.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L. (2002). Cultural contracts theory: Toward an understanding of identity negotiation. Communication Quarterly, 50, 359-67.&lt;/ref&gt; It extends [[identity negotiation]] theory and [[uncertainty reduction theory]] by focusing defining the negotiation experience from the perspective of minority groups when dealing with majority cultural norms. Cultural contracts theory was developed in 1999&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L. (1999). The Negotiation of Cultural Identity. Westport, CT: Praeger Press.&lt;/ref&gt; by Dr. Ronald L. Jackson, an identity scholar and a professor in media and cinema studies at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].

== Background ==
Cultural contracts first appeared in Communication Quarterly in 1999. The theory is inspired by Ting-Toomey's (1986) identity validation model (IDM) that emerged from a study of European American and African American communication experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Ting-Toomey, S. (1986). Conflict communication styles in black and white subjective cultures. International and Intercultural Communication Annual, 10, 75-88 here&lt;/ref&gt; Both theories are rooted in the exchanges between strangers as described in Berger and Calabrese's (1975) uncertainty reduction theory.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, C. R., Calabrese, R. J. (1975). Some Exploration in Initial Interaction and Beyond: Toward a Developmental Theory of Communication. Human Communication Research, 1, 99–112&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural contracts focuses specifically on the exchanges between traditionally marginalized groups and majority groups in power in American society from the standpoint of the minority member. The theory is not limited to oral communication. Any value that makes up an individual's [[worldview]], including behavior and other cultural norms, can be negotiated and subjected to a cultural contract.

Cultural contracts suggests that [[mainstream]] and [[marginalized]] identities are in natural conflict. In order to achieve [[communication]], individuals must decide how much of their values will be negotiated. This results in one of three contracts by the minority identity: ready-to-sign contracts (assimilating to mainstream values); quasi-completed contracts (adapting marginalized values to accommodate mainstream values); and co-completed contracts (validating both mainstream and marginalized values).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson. R. L. (2004). Cultural contracts theory: Toward a critical rhetorical identity. In New approaches to rhetoric&lt;/ref&gt; Most individuals are not aware that they create or sign cultural contracts.

Each contract is a “result of how identities have been personally and socially constructed and exposed."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L. &amp; Crawley, R. (2003).  White Student Confessions about an African American male professor: A Cultural Contracts Theory approach to intimate conversations about race and worldview.  Journal of Men's Studies, 12(1), 25-42&lt;/ref&gt; The first contract is a [[ready-to-sign contract]], or assimilation, which occurs when individuals replace their culture identity for the dominant culture. This contract can be temporary or long-term and benefits the majority. There is no room for negotiating marginalized identity with [[mainstream]] ideals in this contract with no perceived benefit to the marginalized group.[[Quasi-completed contracts]] (adaptation) result in temporarily incorporating a small part of an individual's value to the mainstream value, and vice versa. This is usually a short-term contract since neither identity is dominant in this interaction. Lastly, [[co-completed contracts]] (mutual validation) result in blending values together. Cultural differences are acknowledged and valued in this contract.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, M. L., Jackson, R. L., &amp; Ribeau, S. A. (2003). African American communication: Exploring ethnic identity and culture, p. 248. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; In certain instance, values are deeply penetrated and are not up for exchange. Others are more surface and the perceived benefits of the contract do not conflict with our core identity. This will determine if an individual is willing to sign a cultural contract or remain in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L. (2002). Cultural contracts are not unique and can either be short-term or long-term. This depends on the level of confidence a person has in her worldview. Although negotiation of cultural differences is expected, mutual validation is not always the goal or intent of human interaction. Cultural contracts theory: Toward an understanding of identity negotiation. Communication Quarterly, 50, 359-67&lt;/ref&gt; The contracts can be signed one or two ways: the signee perceives a benefit in accommodating or assimilating, or the signee is forced to accommodate or assimilate.

Applications. In addition to identity research, cultural contracts theory has been used in higher education scholarship to explore the relationships between [[White people|White]] students and [[African America]]n faculty&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L., &amp; Crawley, R. L. (2003). White student confessions about a Black male professor: A cultural contracts theory approach to intimate conversations about race and worldview.

An '''ESD simulator''', also known as an '''ESD gun''', is a handheld unit used to test the immunity of devices to [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD). These simulators are used in special [[electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) laboratories.&lt;ref name="ptltl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenix-testlab.de/en/testlabs/index.jsp|title=Test Laboratory|publisher=Phoenix Testlab|accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taafla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a2la.org/scopepdf/1954-01.pdf|title=The American Association for Laboratory Accreditation|accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESD pulses are fast, high-voltage pulses created when two objects with different electrical charges come into close proximity or contact. Recreating them in a test environment helps to verify that the [[device under test]] is immune to [[static electricity]] discharges.

ESD testing is necessary to receive a [[CE mark]], and for most suppliers of components for motor vehicles as part of required [[electromagnetic compatibility]] testing.&lt;ref name="esd standards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esda.org/esd_fundamentals.html|title=Fundamentals of ESD - Part Six ESD Standards|year=2001|publisher=Electrostatic Discharge Association|accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often useful to automate these tests to eliminate the [[human factor]].&lt;ref name="teseq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teseq.com/com/en/service_support/technical_information/07_AN_NSG_439.pdf|title=Automated ESD testing improves product reliability and safety|publisher=teseq|accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three distinct test models for electrostatic discharge: human-body, machine, and charged-devices models. The human-body model emulates the action of a human body discharging static electricity, the machine model simulates static discharge from a machine, and the charged-device model simulates the charging and discharging events that occur in production processes and equipment.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Many ESD guns have interchangeable modules containing different discharge Networks or RC Modules (Specific [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] and [[capacitance]] values) to simulate different discharges. These modules typically slide into the handle of the pistol portion of the ESD simulator, much like loading some handguns. They change the characteristics of the waveshape discharged from the pistol and are called out in general standards like [[Emc directives|IEC 61000-4-2]], SAE J113 and industry specific standards like ISO 10605. Resistance is referred to in ohms (Ω), capacitance is referred to in [[picofarad]] (pF or "puff"). The most commonly used discharge network is for IEC 61000-4-2 and ISO 10605, expressed as 150pF/330Ω. There are over 50 combinations of resistance and capacitance depending on the standards and the applicable electronics.&lt;ref name="esdguns.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esdguns.com/order-online/discharge-rc-modules|title=RC Modules / Discharge Networks|publisher=ESDGuns.com|accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European green infrastructure''' is an important part of the new (post-2010) EU strategy for [[biodiversity]] and biodiversity policy.

It is one of the main tools to tackle threats on biodiversity resulting from [[habitat fragmentation]], land use change and loss of habitats.
Green Infrastructure will play a decisive role in integrating biodiversity into other policies, such as agriculture, forestry, water, marine and fisheries, regional and cohesion policy, climate change mitigation and adaptation, transport, energy and land use policy. It is also an important tool for existing Directives such as the [[Water Framework Directive]], the Marine Framework Directive, [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] and Strategic Environment Assessment Directives.

In addition, particular attention will be given to strengthening the integration of green infrastructure aspects in the EU’s various funding programmes (e.g. structural and cohesion funds, CAP, LIFE) over the current and future financial programming period starting in 2013 and to improving the ecological coherence of the [[Natura 2000]] Network.

'''Execution by elephant''' was a common method of [[capital punishment]] in [[south Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]], particularly in [[India]], where [[Asian elephant]]s were used to [[Crushing (execution)|crush]], dismember or torture captives in [[public execution]]s. The animals were trained and versatile, able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's [[absolute monarchy|absolute power]] and his ability to control wild animals.

The sight of elephants executing captives both horrified and attracted the interest of European travellers and was recorded in numerous contemporary journals and accounts of life in Asia. The practice was eventually suppressed by the [[European colonialism|European empires]] that colonised the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. While primarily confined to Asia, the practice was occasionally adopted by [[Western world|Western]] powers, such as [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Carthage]], particularly to deal with mutinous soldiers.

== Cultural aspects ==
The intelligence, domesticability and versatility of the elephant gave it considerable advantages over other wild animals such as [[lion]]s and [[bear]]s used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than [[horse]]s: while a horse can be trained to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of [[war elephant]]s with generals such as [[Hannibal]]. Elephants can be trained to execute prisoners in a variety of ways, and can be taught to prolong the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.

Historically, the elephants were under the constant control of a driver or ''[[mahout]]'', thus enabling a ruler to grant a last-minute reprieve and display merciful qualities.&lt;ref name="allsen"&gt;Allsen, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Several such exercises of [[pardon|mercy]] are recorded in various Asian kingdoms. The kings of [[Siam]] trained their elephants to roll the convicted person "about the ground rather slowly so that he is not badly hurt". The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Emperor]] [[Akbar the Great]] is said to have "used this technique to chastise 'rebels' and then in the end the prisoners, presumably much chastened, were given their lives".&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; On one occasion, Akbar was recorded to have had a man thrown to the elephants to suffer five days of such treatment before pardoning him.&lt;ref name="Schimmel"&gt;Schimmel, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants were occasionally used in [[trial by ordeal]] in which the condemned prisoner was released if he managed to fend off the elephant.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt;

The use of elephants in such fashion went beyond the common royal power to dispense life and death. Elephants have long been used as symbols of royal authority (and still are in some places, such as [[Thailand]], where [[White elephant (pachyderm)|white elephants]] are held in reverence). Their use as instruments of state power sent the message that the ruler was able to preside over very powerful creatures who were under total command. The ruler was thus seen as maintaining a moral and spiritual domination over wild beasts, adding to their authority and mystique among subjects.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt;

== Geographical scope ==
[[File:Execution by elephant distribution map.svg|thumb|right|350px|Geographical scope of executions by elephant]]
Execution by elephant has been done in many parts of the world, by both Western and Eastern empires. The earliest records of such executions date back to the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]]. However, the practice was already well established by that time and continued well into the 19th century. While [[African elephant]]s are significantly larger than [[Asian elephant]]s, African powers were not known to make as much use of the animals in warfare or ceremonial affairs compared to their Asian counterparts.

=== Asian powers ===

==== Southeast Asia ====
Elephants are widely reported to have been used to carry out executions in Southeast Asia, and were used in [[Burma]] and [[Malaysia]] from the earliest historical times&lt;ref&gt;Chevers, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the kingdom of [[Champa]] on the other side of the [[Indochina|Indochinese]] Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, Edward H. "The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T'ang Exotics". University of California Press, 1985. p. 80. ASIN: B0000CLTET&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Siam]], elephants were trained to throw the condemned into the air before trampling them to death.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; [[Alexander Hamilton (sailor)|Alexander Hamilton]] provides the following account from Siam:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Alexander|pages=181–182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2YCoCwtJd1gC&amp;pg=181|title=A new account of the East Indies|publisher=John Mosman|volume=2|year=1727|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For Treason and Murder, the Elephant is the Executioner. The condemned Person is made fast to a Stake driven into the Ground for the Purpose, and the Elephant is brought to view him, and goes twice or thrice round him, and when the Elephant's Keeper speaks to the monstrous Executioner, he twines his Trunk round the Person and Stake, and pulling the Stake from the Ground with great Violence, tosses the Man and the Stake into the Air, and in coming down, receives him on his Teeth, and making him off again, puts one of his fore Feet on the Carcase, and squeezes it flat.}}

The journal of [[John Crawfurd]] records another method of execution by elephant in the kingdom of [[Cochinchina]] (modern south [[Vietnam]]), where he served as a British envoy in 1821. Crawfurd recalls an event where "the criminal is tied to a stake, and [Excellency's favourite] elephant runs down upon him and crushes him to death."&lt;ref&gt;Crawfurd, John. "Journal of an Embassy from the Governor-general of India to the Courts of Siam and Cochin China". H. Colburn and R. Bentley, 1830.

==== South Asia ====

===== India =====
Elephants were used as executioners of choice in India for many centuries. Hindu and Muslim rulers executed tax evaders, rebels and enemy soldiers alike "under the feet of elephants".&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; The Hindu ''[[Manu Smriti]]'' or Laws of Manu, written down around AD 200, prescribed execution by elephants for a number of offences. If property was stolen, for instance, "the king should have any thieves caught in connection with its disappearance executed by an elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1305, the [[Delhi Sultanate|sultan of Delhi]] turned the deaths of [[Mongol]] prisoners into public entertainment by having them crushed by elephants.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Weatherford-Genghis Khan, p.116&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] era, "it was a common mode of execution in those days to have the offender trampled underfoot by an elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Natesan, G.A. ''The Indian Review'', p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Captain [[Alexander Hamilton (sailor)|Alexander Hamilton]], writing in 1727, described how the Mughal ruler [[Shah Jahan]] ordered an offending military commander to be carried "to the Elephant Garden, and there to be executed by an Elephant, which is reckoned to be a shameful and terrible Death".&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of Mughal emperors|Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]] ordered the crushing by elephant of an [[imam]] he mistakenly believed to be critical of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Eraly, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Some monarchs also adopted this form of execution for their own entertainment. Another Mughal ruler, the emperor [[Jahangir]], is said to have ordered a huge number of criminals to be crushed for his amusement. The [[France|French]] traveler [[François Bernier]], who witnessed such executions, recorded his dismay at the pleasure that the emperor derived from this cruel punishment.&lt;ref name="Schimmel" /&gt; Nor was crushing the only method used by the Mughals' execution elephants; in the Mughal sultanate of [[Delhi]], elephants were trained to slice prisoners to pieces "with pointed blades fitted to their tusks".&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt;
The Muslim traveler [[Ibn Battuta]], visiting [[Delhi]] in the 1330s, has left the following eyewitness account of this particular type of execution by elephants:&lt;ref&gt;Battuta, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ5CAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:The+intitle:travels+intitle:of+intitle:Ibn+intitle:Battuta&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8K36UOuaLImF4gTe4YDoAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The travels of Ibn Battuta]", transl. Lee, S, London 1829, pp. 146-47&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Upon a certain day, when I myself was present, some men were brought out who had been accused of having attempted the life of the Vizier. They were ordered, accordingly, to be thrown to the elephants, which had been taught to cut their victims to pieces. Their hoofs were cased with sharp iron instruments, and the extremities of these were like knives. On such occasions the elephant-driver rode upon them: and, when a man was thrown to them, they would wrap the trunk about him and toss him up, then take him with the teeth and throw him between their fore feet upon the breast, and do just as the driver should bid them, and according to the orders of the Emperor. If the order was to cut him to pieces, the elephant would do so with his irons, and then throw the pieces among the assembled multitude: but if the order was to leave him, he would be left lying before the Emperor, until the skin should be taken off, and stuffed with hay, and the flesh given to the dogs.}}
Other Indian polities also carried out executions by elephant. The [[Maratha]] [[Chatrapati]]  [[Sambhaji]] ordered this form of death for a number of conspirators, including the Maratha official Anaji Datto in the late seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Eraly, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Maratha leader, the general [[Santaji]], inflicted the punishment for breaches in military discipline. The contemporary historian Khafi Khan reported that "for a trifling offense he [Santaji] would cast a man under the feet of an elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Eraly, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Le Toru Du MOnde.jpg|thumbnail|[[Louis Rousselet]] described this execution in ''Le Tour du Monde'' in 1868.]]
The early 19th century writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] relates how the king of [[Goa]] "keeps certain elephants for the execution of malefactors. When one of these is brought forth to dispatch a criminal, if his keeper desires that the offender be destroyed speedily, this vast creature will instantly crush him to atoms under his foot; but if desired to torture him, will break his limbs successively, as men are [[breaking wheel|broken on the wheel]]."&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; The naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] cited this flexibility of purpose as evidence that elephants were capable of "human reasoning, [rather] than a simple, natural instinct".&lt;ref&gt;Buffon, Georges Louis Leclerc. "Natural history of man, the globe, and of quadrupeds". vol. 1. Leavitt &amp; Allen, 1857. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such executions were often held in public as a warning to any who may transgress. To that end, many of the elephants were especially large, often weighing in excess of nine tons. The executions were intended to be gruesome and often were. They were sometimes preceded by torture publicly inflicted by the same elephant used for the execution. An account of one such torture-and-execution at [[Baroda]] in 1814 has been preserved in ''The Percy Anecdotes'':

{{quote|The man was a slave, and two days before had murdered his master, brother to a native chieftain, called Ameer Sahib. About eleven o'clock the elephant was brought out, with only the driver on his back, surrounded by natives with bamboos in their hands. The criminal was placed three yards behind on the ground, his legs tied by three ropes, which were fastened to a ring on the right hind leg of the animal. At every step the elephant took, it jerked him forward, and every eight or ten steps must have dislocated another limb, for they were loose and broken when the elephant had proceeded five hundred yards. The man, though covered in mud, showed every sign of life, and seemed to be in the most excruciating torments. After having been tortured in this manner for about an hour, he was taken to the outside of the town, when the elephant, which is instructed for such purposes, was backed, and put his foot on the head of the criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Ryley Scott, George. "The Percy Anecdotes vol. VIII". ''The History of Torture Throughout the Ages''. Torchstream Books, 1940. pp. 116–7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The use of elephants as executioners continued well into the latter half of the 19th century. During an expedition to central India in 1868, [[Louis Rousselet]] described the execution of a criminal by an elephant. A sketch depicting the execution showed the condemned being forced to place his head upon a pedestal, and then being held there while an elephant crushed his head underfoot. The sketch was made into a [[woodcut]] and printed in "[[Le Tour du Monde]]", a widely circulated French journal of travel and adventure, as well as foreign journals such as ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Harper's Weekly'', February 3, 1872&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing power of the [[British Empire]] led to the decline and eventual end of elephant executions in India. Writing in 1914, Eleanor Maddock noted that in [[Kashmir]], since the arrival of Europeans, "many of the old customs are disappearing – and one of these is the dreadful custom of the execution of criminals by an elephant trained for the purpose and which was known by the hereditary name of 'Gunga Rao'."&lt;ref&gt;Maddock, Eleanor. "What the Crystal Revealed". ''American Theosophist Magazine'', April to September 1914. p. 859.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Sri Lanka =====
[[File:Crushed by elephant.png|thumb|right|A condemned prisoner being dismembered by an elephant in [[Ceylon]]. Illustration from ''[[An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon]]'' by Robert Knox (1681).]]
Elephants were widely used across the [[Indian subcontinent]] and South Asia as a method of execution. The English sailor [[Robert Knox (sailor)|Robert Knox]], writing in 1681, described a method of execution by elephant which he had witnessed while being held captive in [[Sri Lanka]]. Knox says the elephants he witnessed had their [[tusk]]s fitted with "sharp Iron with a socket with three edges". After impaling the victim's body with its tusks, the elephant would "then tear it in pieces, and throw it limb from limb".&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Robert. "[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14346 An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon]". London, 1681.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century traveler [[James Emerson Tennent]] comments that "a Kandyan [Sri Lankan] chief, who was witness to such scenes, has assured us that the elephant never once applied his tusks, but, placing his foot on the prostrate victim, plucked off his limbs in succession by a sudden movement of his trunk."&lt;ref&gt;Tennent, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; Knox's book depicts exactly this method of execution in a famous drawing, ''An Execution by an Eliphant''.

Writing in 1850, the British diplomat [[Henry Charles Sirr]] described a visit to one of the elephants that had been used by [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], the last king of [[Kandy]], to execute criminals. Crushing by elephant had been abolished by the British after they overthrew the Kandyan kingdom in 1815 but the king's execution elephant was still alive and evidently remembered its former duties. Sirr comments:&lt;ref&gt;Sirr, Sir Charles Henry, quoted in Barrow, George. "Ceylon: Past and Present". John Murray, 1857. pp. 135–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|During the native dynasty it was the practice to train elephants to put criminals to death by trampling upon them, the creatures being taught to prolong the agony of the wretched sufferers by crushing the limbs, avoiding the vital parts. With the last tyrant king of Candy, this was a favourite mode of execution and as one of the elephant executioners was at the former capital during our sojourn there we were particularly anxious to test the creature's sagacity and memory. The animal was mottled and of enormous size, and was quietly standing there with his keeper seated upon his neck; the noble who accompanied us desired the man to dismount and stand on one side.

The chief then gave the word of command, ordering the creature to 'slay the wretch!' The elephant raised his trunk, and twined it, as if around a human being; the creature then made motions as if he were depositing the man on the earth before him, then slowly raised his back-foot, placing it alternately upon the spots where the limbs of the sufferer would have been. This he continued to do for some minutes; then, as if satisfied that the bones must be crushed, the elephant raised his trunk high upon his head and stood motionless; the chief then ordered him to 'complete his work,' and the creature immediately placed one foot, as if upon the man's abdomen, and the other upon his head, apparently using his entire strength to crush and terminate the wretch's misery.}}

==== West Asia ====
During the [[medieval]] period, executions by elephants were used by several West Asian imperial powers, including the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] and [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] empires.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; When the Sassanid king [[Khosrau II]], who had a harem of 3,000 wives and 12,000 female slaves, demanded as a wife Hadiqah, the daughter of the Christian Arab [[Al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir|Na'aman]], Na'aman refused to permit his Christian daughter to enter the harem of a [[Zoroastrian]]; for this refusal, he was trampled to death by an elephant.

The practice appears to have been adopted in parts of the Muslim Middle East. [[Rabbi]] [[Petachiah of Ratisbon]], a twelfth-century Jewish traveler, reported an execution by this means during his stay in [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]]-ruled northern [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]):&lt;ref&gt;Benisch, A. (trans). "Travels of Petachia of Ratisbon". London, 1856.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Execution of Prisonsers Belgrade-Suleymanname.jpg|thumb|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] miniature depicting the execution of prisoners of war in [[Belgrade|Nándorfehérvár]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matrakci |last=Nasuh |url=http://warfare.atwebpages.com/Ottoman/Suleymanname/Execution_of_Prisonsers_Belgrade-Suleymanname.htm |title=Execution of Prisoners, Belgrade |date=1588 |work=Süleymanname, Topkapi Sarai Museum, Ms Hazine 1517}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{quote|At [[Nineveh]] there was an elephant. Its head is not protruding. It is big, eats about two wagon loads of straw at once; its mouth is in its breast, and when it wants to eat it protrudes its lip about two [[cubit]]s, takes up the straw with it, and puts it in its mouth. When the sultan condemns anyone to death, they say to the elephant, "this person is guilty." It then seizes him with its lip, casts him aloft and slays him.}}

=== Western empires ===
The [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] and [[ancient Macedonians]] occasionally used elephants for executions while also making use of [[war elephant]]s for military purposes, most famously in the case of [[Hannibal]]. Deserters, prisoners of war and military criminals are recorded by ancient chroniclers to have been put to death under the foot of an elephant. [[Perdiccas]], who became regent of [[Macedon]] on the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC, had mutineers from the faction of [[Meleager (general)|Meleager]] thrown to the elephants to be crushed in the city of [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Robin Lane. "Alexander the Great". Penguin, 2004. p. 474. {{ISBN|0-14-008878-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman writer [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]] relates the story in his Historiae Alexandri Magni: "Perdiccas saw that they [the mutineers] were paralyzed and at his mercy. He withdrew from the main body some 300 men who had followed Meleager at the time when he burst from the first meeting held after Alexander's death, and before the eyes of the entire army he threw them to the elephants. All were trampled to death beneath the feet of the beasts...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/aa/source22.htm Curt. 10.6-10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103055130/http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/aa/source22.htm |date=2006-01-03 }} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Roman writer [[Valerius Maximus]] records how the general [[Lucius Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus]] "after King [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] was vanquished [in 167 BC], for the same fault (desertion) threw men under elephants to be trampled ... And indeed military discipline needs this kind of severe and abrupt punishment, because this is how strength of arms stands firm, which, when it falls away from the right course, will be subverted."&lt;ref&gt;Futrell, Alison (Quoted by) (ed.). "A Sourcebook on the Roman Games". Blackwell Publishing, 2006. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are fewer records of elephants being used as straightforward executioners for the civil population. One such example is mentioned by [[Josephus]] and the [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical book]] of [[3 Maccabees]] in connection with the [[Egyptian Jews]], though the story is likely apocryphal. 3 Maccabees describes an attempt by [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]] (ruled 221–204 BC) to enslave and brand Egypt's Jews with the symbol of [[Dionysus]]. When the majority of the Jews resisted, the king is said to have rounded them up and ordered them to be trampled on by elephants.&lt;ref&gt;3 Maccabees 5&lt;/ref&gt; The mass execution was ultimately thwarted, supposedly by the intervention of angels, following which Ptolemy took an altogether more forgiving attitude towards his Jewish subjects.&lt;ref&gt;3 Maccabees 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8287">'''Exocannibalism''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''exo-'', "from outside" and cannibalism, "to eat humans"), as opposed to [[endocannibalism]], is the consumption of flesh outside one's close social group—for example, eating one's enemy. When done ritually, it has been associated with being a means of imbibing valued qualities of the victim or as an act of final violence against the deceased in the case of [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathy]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.deathreference.com/Bl-Ce/Cannibalism.html Cannibalism], Encyclopedia of Death and Dying.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a symbolic expression of the domination of an enemy in warfare.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Dow, [http://personalwebs.oakland.edu/~dow/personal/papers/cannibal/cannibal.html Cannibalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807033139/http://personalwebs.oakland.edu/~dow/personal/papers/cannibal/cannibal.html |date=2007-08-07 }}, Reprinted from Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, Vol. 1. Barbara A. Tenenbaum, ed. Pp. 535-537. New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons{{copyvio link|date=february 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such practices have been documented in cultures including the [[Aztecs]] from Mexico, the [[Island Caribs|Carib]] and the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá]] from South America.

Historically, it has also been used as a practical expediency in especially desperate [[Attrition warfare|attritional]] or [[guerrilla warfare]] when the extreme hunger and the abundance of humans being killed coincide to create conditions ripe for cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, Yuki. ''Hidden horrors: Japanese War Crimes in World War II'', Westview Press, 1996, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; Some viewed the practice of exocannibalism  as an act of predation&lt;ref&gt;Menget, Patrik (1985): Guerre, Sociétés et Vision du Monde dans le basses Terres de L'Amerique du Sud. Jalons pour une étude comparative. In: Journal de la Société des Américanistes 71: 129-141.&lt;/ref&gt; tying the action to more of a prey versus predator scenario than one of ceremonial meaning. Exocannibalism has also historically been viewed as a way to acquire the strength and ability of a defeated enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, R. (2008). You Are What You Eat: Cannibalism, Autophagy and the Case of Armin Meiwes. Territories of Evil, 45, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as a final act to either intake or extinguish the existence of an enemy. Notably, the cultures that view exocannibalism as a form of predation do not view the act as taboo. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Cultural practice==
Cannibalism is something that has been found wherever and whenever humans have formed societies. Traditionally, accounts of cannibalism were found embedded in myths and folklore as a common motive that indicated people were less than fully human. Exocannibalism in the form of eating enemies is usually done to express hostility and domination toward the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Biasing Cannibalism in Anthropology|last = Neufeldt|first = Robyn|publisher = |year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrator eats their victim to inflict ultimate indignity and humiliation. It has also been practiced along with headhunting and scalping to display war trophies. John Kantner, an archaeologist who studied alleged cannibalism in the American Southwest, believes that when resources decrease the competition of societies increased and exocannibalism can ensue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Exocannibalism would generally be considered to be the opposite of [[endocannibalism]], but they are both forms of ritual cannibalism. There have been no previous accounts of a culture practicing both forms of ritual cannibalism, aside from a recent study that confirmed the [[Wari’ people|Wari']], an Amazonian tribe in Brazil, practiced both forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dinner with a Cannibal|last = Travis-Henikoff|first = Carole A|publisher = Santa Monica Press|year = 2008|isbn = 9781595800305|location = Santa Monica, CA|pages = 165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wari ===
The Wari people of South America are known for their practice of both endocannibalism and exocannibalism. Endocannibalism had the ability to serve as a form of recognition and respect for the dead. Exocannibalism on the other hand was part of warfare. The Wari had very separate motives behind why they performed each of these modes of cannibalism but both forms had the same basic steps of roasting either flesh or bone and then eating it.&lt;ref&gt;Consuming Grief: Compassionate Cannibalism in an Amazonian Society. Beth A. Conklin. Austin, Texas: University Of Texas, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Wari warriors would kill enemies such as the Brazilians, Bolivians, and members of enemy tribes. The Wari consumed these enemies as a means of transforming them into a form of prey. They viewed warfare cannibalism as a form of predation or hunting. They used exocannibalism as a means by which to label their enemies as subhuman and make their flesh as unimportant as that of any other animal that was typically killed for food.&lt;ref&gt;Conklin B (1997) Consuming Images: Representations of Cannibalism on the Amazonian Frontier. Anthropological Quarterly, 70(2), 68-78. doi:10.2307/3317507&lt;/ref&gt; This practice of cannibalism was continued by the Wari people until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Vilaça A.

=== Fiji ===
The people of Fiji are also documented as having participated in exocannibalism as a form of ritualistic behavior, though history of this is typically hidden by European modification.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, S. (2003). Cannibals Talk: A Response to Obeyesekere &amp; Arens (AT 19,5). Anthropology Today, 19(6), 20-20. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/3695244&lt;/ref&gt; From Fijian legend, the development of the island was due to a god who brought with him cannibalism and warfare. When he arrived on the island, he then married into the single indigenous family. That family then populated the island. This legend along with cannibalism continued into the reality of Fijian people. During wartime, chiefs were able to have their pick of the warriors and soldiers who were killed, seeking out the most famous of those slain. The rest of the soldiers killed that chief did not want would be consumed by the rest of the common people. This form of consumption of the dead was not out of need but instead served as a means by which to assert their power over a conquered people. Consumption of human flesh was not viewed as taboo, but instead was viewed as an act of dining with the gods or dining on the food of gods.&lt;ref&gt;Sahlins MD. 1983. Raw women, cooked men, and other ‘great things’ of the Fiji Islands. The Ethnography of Cannibalism, P Brown, D Tuzin (eds).

Common Worlds and Single Lives: Constituting Knowledge in Pacific Societies, V Keck (ed.). Berg: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with consuming the flesh to show domination over slain enemies, cannibalism was also part of both political and religious rituals performed by the Fijian people. Cannibalism persisted in the Fijian culture because of the cultural beliefs regarding it.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz de Montellano BR. 1978. Aztec cannibalism: An ecological necessity?

The '''fast multipole method''' ('''FMM''') is a [[numerical analysis|numerical]] technique that was developed to speed up the calculation of long-ranged forces in the [[n-body problem|''n''-body problem]]. It does this by expanding the system [[Green's function (many-body theory)|Green's function]] using a [[multipole expansion]], which allows one to group sources that lie close together and treat them as if they are a single source.&lt;ref&gt;Rokhlin, Vladimir (1985).

The FMM has also been applied in accelerating the [[iterative solver]] in the [[boundary element method|method of moments]] (MOM) as applied to [[computational electromagnetics]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;Nader Engheta, William D. Murphy, Vladimir Rokhlin, and Marius Vassiliou (1992), “The Fast Multipole Method for Electromagnetic Scattering Computation,” IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation 40, 634–641.&lt;/ref&gt; The FMM was first introduced in this manner by [[Leslie Greengard|Greengard]] and [[Vladimir Rokhlin (American scientist)|Rokhlin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-theor.ch.cam.ac.uk/people/ross/thesis/node97.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603231158/http://www-theor.ch.cam.ac.uk/people/ross/thesis/node97.html |archivedate=2011-06-03 |df= }} &lt;!--link redirects to the members list--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on the [[multipole expansion]] of the vector [[Helmholtz equation]]. By treating the interactions between far-away basis functions using the FMM, the corresponding matrix elements do not need to be explicitly stored, resulting in a significant reduction in required memory. If the FMM is then applied in a hierarchical manner, it can improve the complexity of matrix-vector products in an iterative solver from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(N^2)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(N)&lt;/math&gt; in finite arithmetic, i.e., given a tolerance &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, the matrix-vector product is guaranteed to be within a tolerance &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt; The dependence of the complexity on the tolerance &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the complexity of FMM is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon)N)&lt;/math&gt;. This has expanded the area of applicability of the MOM to far greater problems than were previously possible.

The FMM, introduced by Rokhlin and Greengard, has been said to be one of the top ten [[algorithm]]s of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Barry A Cipra]] |date=May 16, 2000 |title=The Best of the 20th Century: Editors Name Top 10 Algorithms |journal=SIAM News |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=2 |publisher=[[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] |url=http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=637 |accessdate=December 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FMM algorithm reduces the complexity of matrix-vector multiplication involving a certain type of dense matrix which can arise out of many physical systems.

The FMM has also been applied for efficiently treating the Coulomb interaction in the [[Hartree–Fock method]] and [[density functional theory]] calculations in [[quantum chemistry]].

The '''Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation''' is a [[Gilding|gilt]]-[[bronze]] statue of [[Maitreya]] seated in meditation and is one of the best known and most highly regarded [[Korean Buddhist sculpture]]s.&lt;ref name="MET"&gt;Judith Smith, ''Arts of Korea''. (1998) p. 137–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Now part of the collection of the [[National Museum of Korea]], it was designated as the 78th [[National treasures of Korea|national treasure of Korea]].&lt;ref name="CHA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.cha.go.kr/chaen/search/selectGeneralSearchDetail.do?sCcebKdcd=11&amp;ccebAsno=00780000&amp;sCcebCtcd=11 |title=Heritage Search - National Treasure 78 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Cultural Heritage Administration |access-date=2018-01-22 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue is 83.2&amp;nbsp;centimeters in height.  It was cast from bronze and gilded, probably in the middle or late 6th century.  The bronze is less than one centimeter in thickness (and as thin as 2 mm&lt;ref name="NMK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.go.kr/site/eng/relic/search/view?relicId=4358 |title=Collection Database - Pensive Bodhisattva |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=National Museum of Korea |access-date=2018-01-22 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which attests to the skills of bronze-workers during this time period.&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;

In 1912 a Japanese person acquired it, and donated it to the General Governing Department of Japan over [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]]. Since 1916 it has been housed at the [[National Museum of Korea]].&lt;ref name="CHA"/&gt;

The maitreya is semi-seated on a stool with its right leg crossed over the left in deep meditation.  The face of the statue, has a hint of a smile, and exhibits a sense of serene concentration.  The right arm of the statue, at the elbow, rests on its lap while its delicate hand reaches towards its cheek giving the impression of deep thought.  One shoulder of the maitreya is slightly higher than the other and the upper body is slightly bent forward which also creates the impresses on the viewer an aura of deep thought.  The statue wears a crown which is rather elaborate with many prongs and parts of the crown rest on the shoulders of the maitreya.  The statue is also dressed in a complicated scarf-like vestment that curves around the body with wing-like projections.  The left foot rests on a base which is shaped like a lotus flower.  The statue is probably of [[Silla]] provenance because of the style is more formalized than realistic.&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHA"/&gt;

At one point, the statue had a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], but only traces of it remain. It was designated as the 78th [[National treasures of Korea|national treasure of Korea]] on December 12, 1962. An X-ray analysis in 1963 showed that "it has no trace of defect or repair either inside or out, and that it was made of a rare material using unique techniques.".&lt;ref name="CHA"/&gt;

The '''great books''' are [[book]]s that constitute an essential foundation in the [[literature]] of [[Western culture]]. Specified sets of great books typically range from 100 to 150, though they differ according to purpose and context. For instance, some lists are built to be read by undergraduates in a college semester system (130 books, Torrey Honors Institute),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academics.biola.edu/torrey/academics/reading/ |title=The Reading List &amp;#124; Torrey Honors Institute, Biola University}}&lt;/ref&gt; some are compiled to be sold as a single set of volumes ([[Great Books of the Western World|500 books]], [[Mortimer Adler]]), while some lists aim at a thorough literary criticism (2,400 books, [[Harold Bloom]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Teeter|first=Robert|url=http://sonic.net/~rteeter/grtbloom.html |title=Bloom. Western Canon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The great books are those that tradition, and various institutions and authorities, have regarded as constituting or best expressing the foundations of [[Western culture]] (the [[Western canon]] is a similar but broader designation); derivatively the term also refers to a curriculum or method of education based around a list of such books. [[Mortimer Adler]] lists three criteria for including a book on the list:
* the book has contemporary significance; that is, it has relevance to the problems and issues of our times;
* the book is inexhaustible; it can be read again and again with benefit; "This is an exacting criterion, an ideal that is fully attained by only a small number of the 511 works that we selected. It is approximated in varying degrees by the rest."&lt;ref name="Selecting Works for 1990 Edition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberspacei.com/greatbooks/h2/criteria.htm |title=Selecting Works for the 1990 Edition of the Great Books of the Western World|author=Adler, Mortimer J. |accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the book is relevant to a large number of the great ideas and great issues that have occupied the minds of thinking individuals for the last 25 centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, "Second Look", p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.john-uebersax.com/plato/reading2.htm |title=Thomas Jefferson's Reading Lists |publisher=John-uebersax.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; well known for his interest in higher education, frequently composed great books lists for his friends and correspondents, for example, for Peter Carr in 1785&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson to Peter Carr  (An honest heart, a knowing head; Paris, August 19, 1785). In: Merril D. Peterson (ed.), Thomas Jefferson Works, 1984. (pp. 814–818)&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson to Peter Carr (The homage to Reason; Paris, August 10, 1787). In: Merril D. Peterson (ed.), Thomas Jefferson Works, 1984. (pp. 900–906).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Harvard University published a 51-volume great books series, titled the [[Harvard Classics]].  These volumes are now in the public domain.

The [[Great Books of the Western World]] came about as the result of a discussion among American academics and educators, starting in the 1920s and 1930s and begun by Prof. [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]] of [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radicalacademy.com/adlerlowelllec.htm |title=radicalacademy.com |publisher=radicalacademy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907054422/http://radicalacademy.com/adlerlowelllec.htm |archive-date=2011-09-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; about how to improve the higher education system by returning it to the western [[liberal arts]] tradition of broad cross-disciplinary learning. These academics and educators included [[Robert Hutchins]], [[Mortimer Adler]], [[Stringfellow Barr]], [[Scott Buchanan]], [[Jacques Barzun]], and [[Alexander Meiklejohn]]. The view among them was that the emphasis on narrow specialization in American colleges had harmed the quality of [[higher education]] by failing to expose students to the important products of Western civilization and thought.

They were at odds both with much of the existing educational establishment and with contemporary educational theory. Educational theorists like [[Sidney Hook]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hook|first=Sidney|title=Education for Modern Man|year=1946|publisher=The Dial Press|location=New York, NY|url=http://www.ditext.com/hook/hook.html|authorlink=Sidney Hook|chapter=A Critical Appraisal of the St. John's College Curriculum|quote=Reprinted with some minor changes from ''[[The New Leader]]'', May 26 and June 4, 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Dewey]] (''see [[pragmatism]]'') disagreed with the premise that there was [[educational crossover|crossover]] in education.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Program==
The Great Books Program is a curriculum that makes use of this list of texts. As much as possible, students rely on primary sources. The emphasis is on open discussion with limited guidance by a professor, facilitator, or tutor. Students are also expected to write papers.

In 1920, Professor Erskine taught the first course based on the "great books" program, titled "General Honors", at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=col&gt;{{cite web |title=The Beginnings of the Great Books Movement at Columbia |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/alumni/Magazine/Winter2001/greatBooks.html |date=Winter 2001 |publisher=Columbia Magazine |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faculty&gt;{{cite web |title= An Oasis of Order: The Core Curriculum at Columbia College:Faculty Profiles:John Erskine|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/oasis/profiles/erskine.php |date= |publisher=Columbia College |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped mold its core curriculum. It initially failed, however, shortly after its introduction due to fallings-out between the senior faculty over the best ways to conduct classes and due to concerns about the rigor of the courses. Thus junior faculty including [[Mark Van Doren]]  and [[Mortimer Adler]] after 1923, taught a part of the course. The course was discontinued in 1928, though later reconstituted. Adler left for the [[University of Chicago]] in 1929, where he continued his work on the theme, and along with the University president, [[Robert M. Hutchins]], held an annual seminar of great books. In 1937, when Mark Van Doren redesigned the course, it was already being taught at [[St. John's College, Annapolis]], besides University of Chicago. This course later became Humanities A for freshmen, and subsequently evolved into Literature Humanities.&lt;ref name=col/&gt;  Survivors, however, include [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Columbia's Core Curriculum]], the Common Core at Chicago, and the Core Curriculum at [[Boston University]], each heavily focused on the "great books" of the Western canon.

A university or college Great Books Program is a program inspired by the Great Books movement begun in the United States in the 1920s. The aim of such programs is a return to the Western [[Liberal Arts]] tradition in education, as a corrective to the extreme disciplinary specialisation common within the academy. The essential component of such programs is a high degree of engagement with whole primary texts, called the Great Books. The curricula of Great Books programs often follow a canon of texts considered more or less essential to a student's education, such as Plato's ''Republic'', or Dante's ''Divine Comedy''. Such programs often focus exclusively on Western culture. Their employment of primary texts dictates an interdisciplinary approach, as most of the Great Books do not fall neatly under the prerogative of a single contemporary academic discipline. Great Books programs often include designated discussion groups as well as lectures, and have small class sizes. In general students in such programs receive an abnormally high degree of attention from their professors, as part of the overall aim of fostering a community of learning.

There are only a few true "Great Books Programs" still in operation.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} These schools focus almost exclusively on the Great Books Curriculum throughout enrollment and do not offer classes analogous to those commonly offered at other colleges. The first and best known of these schools is [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)#Great Books program|St. John's College]] in Annapolis and Santa Fe (program established in 1937);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/academic/readlist.shtml |title=St. John’s College &amp;#124; Academic Program &amp;#124; The Reading List |publisher=Stjohnscollege.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527090156/http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/academic/readlist.shtml |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was followed by [[Shimer College]] in Chicago, the Integral Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarys-ca.edu/the-integral-program|title=The Integral Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Saint Mary's College of California (1955), [[Thomas More College of Liberal Arts]] in Merrimack, New Hampshire (est. 1978), [[Northeast Catholic College]] in Warner, New Hampshire,  and [[Thomas Aquinas College]] in Santa Paula, California. More recent schools with this type of curriculum include [[New Saint Andrews College]] in Moscow, Idaho (est. 1994), [[Gutenberg College]] in Eugene, Oregon (est. 1994), [[Harrison Middleton University]] in Tempe, Arizona (est. 1998), [[Wyoming Catholic College]] in Lander, Wyoming (est. 2005), and [[Imago Dei College]] in Oak Glen, California (est. 2010). Fordham University's Honors Program at Rose Hill incorporates the Great Books curriculum into a rigorous first four semesters in the program. The [[University of Notre Dame]]'s Program of Liberal Studies, established in 1950, is a highly regarded Great Books Program that operates as a separate institution within the College of Liberal Arts. [[Dharma Realm Buddhist University]] is the first Great Books school to offer curriculum combining Eastern and Western classics.&lt;ref name="drbu.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dharma Realm Buddhist University Accepting Applications for Undergraduate Program|url=http://www.drbu.org/news/dharma-realm-buddhist-university-accepting-applications-undergraduate-program|website=Dharma Realm Buddhist University|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for the Study of the Great Ideas advances the Great Conversation found in the great books by providing Adler's guidance, and resource materials through both live and on-line seminars, educational and philosophical consultation, international presence on the Internet, access to the Center's library collection of books, essays, articles, journals and audio/video programs.

==Controversy==
In contemporary scholarship, the great books curriculum was drawn into the popular debate about [[multiculturalism]], traditional education, the "culture war," and the role of the intellectual in American life. Much of this debate centered on reactions to the publication of ''[[The Closing of the American Mind]]'' in 1987 by [[Allan Bloom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ditext.com/searle/searle1.html John Searle, "The Storm Over the University," ''The New York Review of Books'', December 6, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series==
{{main article|Great Books of the Western World}}

The ''Great Books of the Western World'' is a hardcover 60-volume collection (originally 54 volumes) of the books on the great books list (about 517 individual works). Many of the books in the collection were translated into English for the first time.{{fact|date=February 2017}} A prominent feature of the collection is a two-volume [[Syntopicon]] that includes essays written by Mortimer Adler on 102 "great ideas." Following each essay is an extensive outline of the idea with page references to relevant passages throughout the collection. Familiar to many Americans, the collection is available from [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]], which owns the copyright.

Shortly after Adler retired from the [[Great Books Foundation]] in 1989, a second edition (1990) of the ''Great Books of the Western World'' was published; it included more Hispanic and female authors and, for the first time, works by black authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010701/ai_n13916438 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104001606/http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010701/ai_n13916438 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-11-04 |author=Sabrina Walters |title=Great Books won Adler fame, scorn |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=2001-07-01 |accessdate=2007-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure as president of the Foundation, Adler had resisted such additions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010703/ai_n13917760 |author=Peter Temes |title=Death of a Great Reader and Philosopher |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=2001-07-03 |accessdate=2007-07-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104012348/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010703/ai_n13917760 |archivedate=2007-11-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We did not base our selections on an author's nationality, religion, politics, or field of study; nor on an author's race or gender. Great books were not chosen to make up quotas of any kind; there was no "affirmative action" in the process&amp;nbsp;... we chose the great books on the basis of their relevance to at least 25 of the 102 great ideas. Many of the great books are relevant to a much larger number of the 102 great ideas, as many as 75 or more great ideas, a few to all 102 great ideas. In sharp contrast are the good books that are relevant to less than 10 or even as few as 4 or 5 great ideas. We placed such books in the lists of Recommended Readings to be found in the last section in each of the 102 chapters of the "Syntopicon". Here readers will find many twentieth-century female authors, black authors, and Latin American authors whose works we recommended but did not include in the second edition of the great books.&lt;ref name="Selecting Works for 1990 Edition"/&gt;}}
{{quote|In the course of history&amp;nbsp;... new books have been written that have won their place in the list. Books once thought entitled to belong to it have been superseded; and this process of change will continue as long as men can think and write. It is the task of every generation to reassess the tradition in which it lives, to discard what it cannot use, and to bring into context with the distant and intermediate past the most recent contributions to the Great Conversation.&lt;ref&gt;''Great Books – The Foundation of a Liberal Education'', New York – Simon &amp; Schuster, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Television==
{{Main article| The Learning Channel's Great Books}}
In 1954 Mortimer Adler hosted a live weekly television series in San Francisco, comprising 52 half-hour programs, entitled ''The Great Ideas''. These programs were produced by the Institute for Philosophical Research and were carried as a public service by the [[American Broadcasting Company]], presented by National Educational Television (NET), the precursor to what is now PBS. Adler bequeathed these films to the Center for the Study of the Great Ideas, where they are available for purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreatideas.org/mortimer_adler_videos/index.html|title=Mortimer Adler Videos on The Great Ideas|website=www.thegreatideas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 and 1994, The [[Learning Channel]] created a series of one-hour programs discussing many of the great books of history and their impact on the world. It was narrated by [[Donald Sutherland]] and [[Morgan Freeman]], amongst others.

'''Herd behavior''' describes how individuals in a group can act collectively without centralized direction. The term can refer to the [[behavior]] of animals in [[herd]]s, [[Pack (canine)|packs]], [[bird flock]]s, [[fish school]]s and so on, as well as the behavior of humans in demonstrations, [[riots]] and [[general strikes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braha | first1 = D | year = 2012 | title = Global Civil Unrest: Contagion, Self-Organization, and Prediction. | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 10| page = e48596 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0048596 | pmid=23119067 | pmc=3485346}}&lt;/ref&gt; sporting events, religious gatherings, episodes of mob violence and everyday decision-making, judgement and opinion-forming.

Raafat, Chater and Frith proposed an integrated approach to herding, describing two key issues, the mechanisms of transmission of thoughts or behavior between individuals and the patterns of connections between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raafat |first=R. M. |last2=Chater |first2=N. |last3=Frith |first3=C. |title=Herding in humans |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |year=2009 |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=420–428 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They suggested that bringing together diverse theoretical approaches of herding behavior illuminates the applicability of the concept to many domains, ranging from cognitive neuroscience to economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burke |first=C. J. |last2=Tobler |first2=P. N. |last3=Schultz |first3=W. |last4=Baddeley |first4=M. |doi=10.3389/fnhum.2010.00048 |title=Striatal BOLD response reflects the impact of herd information on financial decisions |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |year=2010 |volume=4 |page=48 |pmid=20589242 |pmc=2892997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animals==
[[File:Stereoscopic-motion-analysis-in-densely-packed-clusters-3D-analysis-of-the-shimmering-behaviour-in-1742-9994-8-3-S1.ogv|thumb|[[Shimmering behaviour]] of ''[[Apis dorsata]]'' (giant honeybees)]]
A group of animals fleeing from a predator shows the nature of herd behavior. In 1971, in the oft cited article "Geometry For The Selfish Herd", [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[W. D. Hamilton]] asserted that each individual group member reduces the danger to itself by moving as close as possible to the center of the fleeing group. Thus the herd appears as a unit in moving together, but its function emerges from the uncoordinated behavior of self-serving individuals.&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=W. D. |last=Hamilton |year=1971 |title=Geometry for the Selfish Herd |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=295–311 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(71)90189-5 |pmid=5104951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symmetry-breaking==
Asymmetric aggregation of animals under panic conditions has been observed in many species, including humans, mice, and ants.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0401/0401124.pdf|title= Panic-induced symmetry breaking in escaping ants|first1=E.|last1=Altshuler|first2=O.|last2=Ramos|first3=Y.|last3=Nuñez|first4=J.|last4=Fernández|location=[[University of Havana]], [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-05-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical models have demonstrated symmetry-breaking similar to observations in empirical studies. For example, when panicked individuals are confined to a room with two equal and equidistant exits, a majority will favor one exit while the minority will favor the other.

Possible mechanisms for this behavior include [[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton]]’s [[selfish herd theory]], neighbor copying, or the byproduct of communication by social animals or runaway positive feedback.

Characteristics of escape panic include:

* Individuals attempt to move faster than normal.
* Interactions between individuals become physical.
* Exits become arched and clogged.
* Escape is slowed by fallen individuals serving as obstacles.
* Individuals display a tendency towards mass or copied behavior.
* Alternative or less used exits are overlooked.&lt;ref name="hamilton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altshuler | first1 = E. | last2 = Ramos | first2 = O. | last3 = Núñez | first3 = Y. | last4 = Fernández | first4 = J. | last5 = Batista-Leyva | first5 = A.

==In human societies==
The philosophers [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] were among the first to criticize what they referred to as "the crowd" (Kierkegaard) and "herd morality" and the "herd instinct" (Nietzsche) in human society. Modern [[psychology|psychological]] and [[economics|economic]] research has identified herd behavior in humans to explain the phenomenon of large numbers of people acting in the same way at the same time. The British surgeon [[Wilfred Trotter]] popularized the "herd behavior" phrase in his book, ''[[Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War]]'' (1914). In ''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]'', [[Thorstein Veblen]] explained economic behavior in terms of social influences such as "emulation," where some members of a group mimic other members of higher status. In "The Metropolis and Mental Life" (1903), early sociologist [[George Simmel]] referred to the "impulse to sociability in man", and sought to describe "the forms of association by which a mere sum of separate individuals are made into a 'society'&amp;nbsp;". Other social scientists explored behaviors related to herding, such as [[Sigmund Freud]] (crowd psychology), [[Carl Jung]] (collective unconscious), [[Everett Dean Martin]] (Behavior of Crowds) and [[Gustave Le Bon]] (the popular mind).
[[Swarm theory]] observed in non-human societies is a related concept and is being explored as it occurs in human society.

===Stock market bubbles===
Large stock market trends often begin and end with periods of frenzied buying (bubbles) or selling (crashes). Many observers cite these episodes as clear examples of herding behavior that is irrational and driven by emotion—greed in the bubbles, fear in the crashes. Individual investors join the crowd of others in a rush to get in or out of the market.&lt;ref&gt;[[Markus K. Brunnermeier]], [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Economics/Business/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780198296980 Asset ''Pricing under Asymmetric Information: Bubbles, Crashes, Technical Analysis, and Herding''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102846/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Economics/Business/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780198296980 |date=2007-09-29 }}, Oxford University Press (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some followers of the [[technical analysis]] school of investing see the herding behavior of investors as an example of extreme [[market sentiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Prechter, ''The Wave Principle of Human Social Behavior'', New Classics Library (1999), pp. 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt; The academic study of [[behavioral finance]] has identified herding in the collective irrationality of investors, particularly the work of [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureates [[Vernon L. Smith]], [[Amos Tversky]], [[Daniel Kahneman]], and [[Robert Shiller]].&lt;ref name=Shiller2000&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert J. |last=Shiller |title=Irrational Exuberance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=djq5RWiUN6oC&amp;printsec=frontcover |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2000 |pages=149–153 |isbn= |accessdate=4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|a|a|none}}

Hey and Morone (2004) analyzed a model of herd behavior in a market context. Their work is related to at least two important strands of literature. The first of these strands is that on herd behavior in a non-market context. The seminal references are [[Abhijit Banerjee|Banerjee]] (1992) and Bikhchandani, [[David Hirshleifer|Hirshleifer]] and [[Ivo Welch|Welch]] (1992), both of which showed that herd behavior may result from private information not publicly shared. More specifically, both of these papers showed that individuals, acting sequentially on the basis of private information and public knowledge about the behavior of others, may end up choosing the socially undesirable option. The second of the strands of literature motivating this paper is that of information aggregation in market contexts. A very early reference is the classic paper by Grossman and Stiglitz (1976) that showed that uninformed traders in a market context can become informed through the price in such a way that private information is aggregated correctly and efficiently. In this strand of the literature, the most commonly used empirical methodologies to test for herding toward the average, are the works of Christie and Huang (1995) and Chang, Cheng and Khorana (2000). Overall, it was shown that it is possible to observe herd-type behavior in a market context. The results refer to a market with a well-defined fundamental value. Even if herd behavior might only be observed rarely, this has important consequences for a whole range of real markets – most particularly foreign exchange markets.

One such herdish incident was the price volatility that surrounded the [[Uranium bubble of 2007|2007 Uranium bubble]], which started with flooding of the [[Cigar Lake Mine]] in [[Saskatchewan]], during the year 2006.&lt;ref name=NuclearMarketReview2012&gt;{{citation |date=8 June 2012 |author=In Focus article |title=Reproduced article from Nuclear Market Review|chapter=WNFM: A Focus on Fundamentals One Year After Fukushima |publisher=TradeTech |chapter-url=http://www.uranium.info/market_analyses.php |accessdate=4 March 2013 |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There are several reproduced In Focus articles on this page.

===In crowds===
{{Main|Crowd psychology}}
Crowds that gather on behalf of a grievance can involve herding behavior that turns violent, particularly when confronted by an opposing ethnic or racial group. The [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]], [[New York Draft Riots]] and [[Tulsa Race Riot]] are notorious in U.S. history. The idea of a "group mind" or "mob behavior" was put forward by the [[France|French]] social psychologists [[Gabriel Tarde]] and [[Gustave Le Bon]].

===Everyday decision-making===
"Benign" herding behaviors may occur frequently in everyday decisions based on learning from the information of others, as when a person on the street decides which of two restaurants to dine in. Suppose that both look appealing, but both are empty because it is early evening; so at random, this person chooses restaurant A. Soon a couple walks down the same street in search of a place to eat. They see that restaurant A has customers while B is empty, and choose A on the assumption that having customers makes it the better choice. Because other passersby do the same thing into the evening, restaurant A does more business that night than B. This phenomenon is also referred as an [[information cascade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Abhijit V. |last=Banerjee |year=1992 |title=A Simple Model of Herd Behavior |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=107 |issue=3 |pages=797–817 |doi=10.2307/2118364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Sushil |last=Bikhchandani |authorlink2=David Hirshleifer |first2=David |last2=Hirshleifer |authorlink3=Ivo Welch |first3=Ivo |last3=Welch |year=1992 |title=A Theory of Fads, Fashion, Custom, and Cultural Change as Informational Cascades |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=992–1026 |doi=10.1086/261849 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Froot | first1 = K | last2 = Schaferstein | first2 = DS | last3 = Jeremy Stein | first3 = J | year = 1992 | title = Herd on the street: Informational inefficiencies in a market with short-term speculation | url = http://www.people.hbs.edu/kfroot/oldwebsite/cvpaperlinks/herd_on_the_street.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Finance | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 1461–1484 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1992.tb04665.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirshleifer | first1 = D | last2 = Teoh | first2 = SH | year = 2003 | title = Herd behaviour and cascading in capital markets: A review and synthesis | url = http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/5186/1/MPRA_paper_5186.pdf | format = PDF | journal = European Financial Management | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 25–66 | doi = 10.1111/1468-036X.00207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In marketing ==
Herd behavior is often a useful tool in [[marketing]] and, if used properly, can lead to increases in sales and changes to the [[Social structure|structure of society]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Whilst it has been shown that financial incentives cause action in large numbers of people, herd mentality often wins out in a case of "Keeping up with the Joneses".

=== In brand and product success ===
Communications technologies have contributed to the proliferation to [[consumer choice]] and "the power of crowds",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Chen|first = Yi-Fen|date = 2008-09-01|title = Herd behavior in purchasing books online|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563207001458|journal = Computers in Human Behavior|series = Including the Special Issue: Internet Empowerment|volume = 24|issue = 5|pages = 1977–1992|doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2007.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers increasingly have more access to opinions and information from both [[opinion leader]]s and formers on platforms that have largely [[user-generated content]], and thus have more tools with which to complete any [[decision-making]] process. [[Popularity]] is seen as an indication of better quality, and consumers will use the opinions of others posted on these platforms as a powerful compass to guide them towards products and brands that align with their preconceptions and the decisions of others in their [[peer group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Lessig|first = V|date = 1977|title = Students and Housewives: Differences in Susceptibility to Reference Group Influence|url =|journal = Journal of Consumer Research|doi =10.1086/208685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account differences in needs and their position in the [[socialization]] process, Lessig &amp; Park examined groups of students and housewives and the influence that these reference groups have on one another. By way of herd mentality, students tended to encourage each other towards beer, hamburger and cigarettes, whilst [[housewives]] tended to encourage each other towards furniture and detergent. Whilst this particular study was done in 1977, one cannot discount its findings in today's society. A study done by Burke, Leykin, Li and Zhang in 2014 on the [[social influence]] on shopper behavior shows that shoppers are influenced by direct interactions with companions, and as a group size grows, herd behaviour becomes more apparent. Discussions that create excitement and interest have greater impact on touch frequency and purchase likelihood grows with greater involvement caused by a large group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Zhang|first = Xiaoling|last2 = Li|first2 = Shibo|last3 = Burke|first3 = Raymond R.|last4 = Leykin|first4 = Alex|date = 2014-05-13|title = An Examination of Social Influence on Shopper Behavior Using Video Tracking Data|url = http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.12.0106|journal = Journal of Marketing|volume = 78|issue = 5|pages = 24–41|doi = 10.1509/jm.12.0106|issn = 0022-2429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shoppers in this Midwestern American shopping outlet were monitored and their purchases noted, and it was found up to a point, potential customers preferred to be in stores which had moderate levels of traffic. The other people in the store not only served as company, but also provided an inference point on which potential customers could model their behavior and make [[purchase decision]]s, as with any reference group or community.

[[Social media]] can also be a powerful tool in perpetuating herd behaviour.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Its immeasurable amount of user-generated content serves as a platform for opinion leaders to take the stage and influence purchase decisions, and recommendations from peers and evidence of positive online experience all serve to help consumers make purchasing decisions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Dhar|first = Joydip|last2 = Jha|first2 = Abhishek Kumar|date = 2014-10-03|title = Analyzing Social Media Engagement and its Effect on Online Product Purchase Decision Behavior|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10911359.2013.876376|journal = Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment|volume = 24|issue = 7|pages = 791–798|doi = 10.1080/10911359.2013.876376|issn = 1091-1359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunawan and Huarng's 2015 study concluded that social influence is essential in [[framing (social sciences)|framing]] attitudes towards brands, which in turn leads to purchase intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Gunawan|first = Dedy Darsono|last2 = Huarng|first2 = Kun-Huang|date = 2015-11-01|title = Viral effects of social network and media on consumers' purchase intention|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296315002325|journal = Journal of Business Research|volume = 68|issue = 11|pages = 2237–2241|doi = 10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influencers form norms which their peers are found to follow, and targeting [[extrovert]]ed personalities increases chances of purchase even further.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is because the stronger personalities tend to be more engaged on consumer platforms and thus spread word of mouth information more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Cheung|first = Christy M.

=== In social marketing ===
Marketing can easily transcend beyond commercial roots, in that it can be used to encourage [[activism|action]] to do with health, [[environmentalism]] and general society. Herd mentality often takes a front seat when it comes to [[social marketing]], paving the way for [[Civil society campaign|campaign]]s such as [[Earth Day]], and the variety of anti-smoking and anti-obesity campaigns seen in every country. Within cultures and communities, marketers must aim to influence opinion leaders who in turn influence each other,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = James M. Cronin|last2 = Mary B. McCarthy|date = 2011-07-12|title = Preventing game over: A study of the situated food choice influences within the videogames subculture|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/20426761111141887|journal = Journal of Social Marketing|volume = 1|issue = 2|pages = 133–153|doi = 10.1108/20426761111141887|issn = 2042-6763}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is the herd mentality of any group of people that ensures a social campaign's success. A campaign run by Som la Pera in Spain to combat teenage obesity found that campaigns run in schools are more effective due to influence of teachers and peers, and students' high visibility, and their interaction with one another. Opinion leaders in schools created the logo and branding for the campaign, built content for social media and led in-school presentations to engage audience interaction. It was thus concluded that the success of the campaign was rooted in the fact that its means of communication was the audience itself, giving the target audience a sense of ownership and empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Lozano|first = Natàlia|last2 = Prades|first2 = Jordi|last3 = Montagut|first3 = Marta|date = 2015-10-01|title = Som la Pera: How to develop a social marketing and public relations campaign to prevent obesity among teenagers in Catalonia|url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/cjcs/2015/00000007/00000002/art00009?token=00531b149b5bd549bde7e41225f4038382c2b672148783b774450576b34272c5f7b3d6d3f4e4b34f5a7|journal = Catalan Journal of Communication &amp; Cultural Studies|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages = 251–259|doi = 10.1386/cjcs.7.2.251_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned previously, students exert a high level of influence over one another, and by encouraging stronger personalities to lead opinions, the organizers of the campaign were able to secure the attention of other students who identified with the reference group.

Herd behaviour not only applies to students in schools where they are highly visible, but also amongst communities where perceived action plays a strong role. Between 2003 and 2004, California State University carried out a study to measure household [[energy saving|conservation of energy]], and motivations for doing so. It was found that factors like saving the environment, saving money or [[social responsibility]] did not have as great an impact on each household as the perceived behaviour of their neighbours did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Nolan|first = Jessica M.|last2 = Schultz|first2 = P. Wesley|last3 = Cialdini|first3 = Robert B.|last4 = Goldstein|first4 = Noah J.|last5 = Griskevicius|first5 = Vladas|date = 2008-07-01|title = Normative Social Influence is Underdetected|url = http://psp.sagepub.com/content/34/7/913|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language = en|volume = 34|issue = 7|pages = 913–923|doi = 10.1177/0146167208316691|issn = 0146-1672|pmid = 18550863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the financial incentives of saving money, closely followed by moral incentives of protecting the environment, are often thought of as being a community's greatest guiding compass, more households responded to the encouragement to save energy when they were told that 77% of their neighbours were using fans instead of air conditioning, proving that communities are more likely to engage in a behaviour if they think that everyone else is already taking part.

Herd behaviours shown in the two examples exemplify that it can be a powerful tool in social marketing, and if harnessed correctly, has the potential to achieve great change. It is clear that opinion leaders and their influence achieve huge reach among their reference groups and thus can be used as the loudest voices to encourage others in any collective direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2962">'''Induced gas flotation''' ('''IGF''') is a [[water treatment]] process that clarifies [[wastewater]]s (or other waters) by the removal of suspended matter such as oil or solids. The removal is achieved by injecting gas bubbles into the water or wastewater in a flotation tank or basin. The small bubbles adhere to the suspended matter causing the suspended matter to float to the surface of the water where it may then be removed by a skimming device.

Induced gas flotation is very widely used in treating the industrial wastewater [[effluent]]s from [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and [[chemical plant]]s, [[Natural gas processing|natural gas processing plants]] and similar industrial facilities. A very similar process known as ''[[dissolved air flotation]]'' is also used for waste water treatment. ''[[Froth flotation]]'' is commonly used in the processing of mineral ores.

IGF units in the [[oil industry]] do not use air as the flotation medium due to the explosion risk. These IGF units use [[natural gas]] or [[nitrogen]] to create the bubbles.

==Process description==
The feed water to the IGF float tank is often (but not always) dosed with a coagulant (such as ferric chloride or aluminum sulfate) to [[flocculate]] the suspended matter.

The bubbles may be generated by an impeller, eductors or a sparger. The bubbles adhere to the suspended matter, causing the suspended matter to float to the surface and form a froth layer which is then removed by a skimmer. The froth-free water exits the float tank as the clarified effluent from the IGF unit.&lt;ref name=Aqueous&gt;{{cite book

Some IGF unit designs utilize parallel plate packing material to provide more separation surface and therefore to enhance the separation efficiency of the unit.

[[File:Ramallah woman 15029v.jpg|right|thumb|A woman from [[Ramallah]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] in embroidered clothes, 1929–1946]]

'''Embroidery''' was [[Islamic art|an important art]] in the [[Islamic world]] from the beginning of [[Islam]] until the [[Industrial Revolution]] disrupted traditional ways of life.

==Overview==
[[File:Morocco Fez Embroidery Horse Cover.JPG|thumb|left|[[Fly mask]] embroidered with silver thread. [[Fez, Morocco]]. 18th–19th century]]

Early Islam took over societies where the [[embroidery]] of clothes for both sexes and other textiles was very popular. Both the [[Byzantine]] and Persian [[Sasanian]] empires used clothing embroidered with designs including rather large human figures as well as animals, with effects comparable to those of modern [[teeshirt]]s. The exterior of the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] was already before Islam "covered on the outside with multi-coloured textile hangings",&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen, 20&lt;/ref&gt; very likely including embroidery as their modern Islamic equivalents often have. [[Muhammad]] objected to animal designs, perhaps embroidered, he saw on cushions when visiting his wife [[Aisha]]'s house.{{efn|Aisha reported in a [[hadith]] "I bought a cushion having on it pictures (of animals). When [[Allah]]'s Apostle saw it, he stood at the door and did not enter. I noticed the sign of disapproval on his face and said, "O Allah's Apostle! I repent to Allah and His Apostle. What [[Islamic views on sin|sin]] have I committed?' Allah's Apostle said. "What is this cushion?" I said, "I have bought it for you so that you may sit on it and recline on it." Allah's Apostle said, "The makers of these pictures will be punished on the [[Islamic eschatology|Day of Resurrection]], and it will be said to them, 'Give life to what you have created (i.e., these pictures).' " The Prophet added, "The Angels of (Mercy) do not enter a house in which there are pictures (of animals)." [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'' {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|318}}, {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes-usc|7|62|110}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} These types of design largely disappeared under Islam, though plant-based motifs often remained acceptable. 

The 17th century [[Turkish people|Turkish]] traveller [[Evliya Çelebi]] called embroidery the "craft of the two hands".&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt; Because it was a sign of high social status in Muslim societies, it had long been widely popular. In cities such as [[Damascus]], [[Cairo]] and [[Istanbul]], embroidery was visible on handkerchiefs, uniforms, flags, [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], shoes, robes, tunics, [[Horse tack|horse trappings]], slippers, sheaths, pouches, covers, and even on leather belts. Craftsmen embroidered items with [[gold]] and [[silver]] thread. Embroidery cottage industries, some employing over 800 people, grew to supply these items.&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/200703/the.skill.of.the.two.hands.htm |publisher=Aramco World |title=The Skill of the Two Hands |author=Stone, Caroline| volume=58 |issue=3 |date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the 16th century, in the reign of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]], his chronicler [[Abu al-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] wrote in the famous ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'':

[[File:18th century Ottoman barber apron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] barber's apron. Embroidery with silver and silk thread on wool. 18th century]]

{{quote|His majesty [Akbar] pays much attention to various stuffs; hence [[Iran]]i, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], and [[Mongolia]]n articles of wear are in much abundance especially textiles embroidered in the patterns of ''Nakshi'', ''Saadi'', ''Chikhan'', ''Ari'', ''Zardozi'', ''Wastli'', ''Gota'' and ''Kohra''. The imperial workshops in the towns of [[Lahore]], [[Agra]], [[Fatehpur Sikri|Fatehpur]] and [[Ahmedabad]] turn out many masterpieces of workmanship in fabrics, and the figures and patterns, knots and variety of fashions which now prevail astonish even the most experienced travellers. Taste for fine material has since become general, and the drapery of embroidered fabrics used at feasts surpasses every description.&lt;ref name=Werner&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Werner |first1=Louis |title=Mughal Maal |url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/201104/mughal.maal.htm |publisher=Aramco World| volume=62 |issue=4 |date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Embroidery offered symbolic protection for the most highly valued objects, including babies, household possessions and things with religious significance. When in the 16th and 17th centuries in Turkey, men wore [[turban]]s as a sign of Islam, they placed their turbans under embroidered cloths.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==

[[File:Turkish - Mirror Cover - Walters 83214 - Detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turkey|Turkish]] Mirror Cover with floral ornament based on Ottoman ceramics. A [[superstition]] warned against looking into a mirror at night. 18th century]]

A wide variety of embroidery techniques were used across the Islamic world, with an equally broad range of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 174–203&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uyghurs|Uighur]] women embroider [[felt]] [[Taqiyah (cap)|skull caps]], for use on their own or as the base for a [[turban]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

In Morocco and Tunisia, [[satin stitch]] was used for items such as decorative curtains and mirror covers.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 174–175&lt;/ref&gt; A form of satin stitch present in the [[Bedouin]] societies of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], sometimes referred to as ''khiyat al madrassa'' ("school embroidery"), was used for furnishings. Prior to the stitching process, a shape was drawn onto the fabric by a skilled artist. Designs incorporating natural themes such as birds or flowers were most common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu Saud|first=Abeer|title=Qatari Women: Past and Present|date=1984|isbn=978-0582783720|publisher=Longman Group|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surface satin stitch, worked only on the upper surface, is a more economical but looser technique, vulnerable to wear, and so is mainly used for special occasions. In [[Punjab]], [[Phulkari]] (flower work) shawls were however daily wear for women in the countryside, while special ones, bagh, were completely covered with embroidery and were made by maternal grandmothers for their granddaughters' weddings.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chain stitch]], which is adaptable and relatively easy to create, was used in Persia for [[Resht]] embroidery, with densely worked flowers and [[arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]] on felted woollen cloths.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; A type of embroidery similar to heavy chain stitch, known as ''[[Kurar (embroidery)|kurar]]'', was previously used by Bedouin to create dresses for both men and women. It required four people, with each person carrying four threads which were either of varying colors or silver and gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu Saud|first=Abeer|title=Qatari Women: Past and Present|date=1984|isbn=978-0582783720|publisher=Longman Group|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Algerian - Turban Cover - Walters 83178.jpg|thumb|[[Algeria]]n [[turban]] cover. Silk embroidery on [[linen]]. 18th century]]

[[Cross stitch]] was used across the [[Middle East]] in [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], Palestine and [[Sinai]] to work wedding dresses with bold embroidery in red, with triangular [[amulet]]s or [[carnation]] flowers on a black background.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp.180–181&lt;/ref&gt;

Another widely used technique, [[Herringbone stitch]], was used in [[Afghanistan]] to embroider [[bridegroom]]'s [[smock-frock|smock]]s with raised bands of red, green or white stitchery on a white background.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Couching]], the stitching of decorative cord on to the surface of a fabric, was used widely across the Islamic world. In Afghanistan, a [[velvet]] dress could be worked in military style with gold-coloured threads on the front, sleeves and hem. Chieftains in [[Montenegro]] could wear robes heavily couched in gold thread. In Palestine, dresses could be heavily worked in vertical panels with couched threads of metal and cotton. In Syria, jackets were couched with stylised flowers and trees. In the Northwest Frontier of [[Pakistan]], waistcoats were sewn with a combination of [[appliqué]] panels and couched metal [[braid]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 184–185&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Embroidery from Bukhara Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art 85.81.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Embroidered [[Suzani (textile)|Suzani]] from [[Bukhara]], [[Uzbekistan]]. Cotton with silk threads. Late 19th century]]

In [[Central Asia]], Bokhara couching using continuous thread creates spectacular [[suzani (textile)|suzani]]s, hangings for wedding halls and bridal beds. Carnation and [[pomegranate]] motifs symbolised [[fertility]]. The technique was also used in Afghanistan and [[Uzbekistan]] for horse blankets and brazier covers.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 186–187&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blanket stitch]], [[buttonhole stitch]], and eyelet stitch all had the original function of strengthening the edges of textiles subject to daily wear and tear, but were adapted for decorative purposes. In North Africa and the Middle East, eyelet stitch is made using a spoked wheel pattern of stitches, or in the Algerian form without an enclosing circle. In [[Turkmenistan]], hook and tulip motifs could be worked in buttonhole stitch. In Afghanistan, men's shirts could be embroidered with herringbone and buttonhole stitches in white silk on white cotton, in elaborate arabesques.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Afghanistan Smock detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of man's white [[satin stitch]] embroidered [[smock-frock|smock]] from Afghanistan. Mid 20th century.]]
[[Whitework]], the use of white thread on a white ground, covers a variety of techniques and materials, and is used in different forms around the world. In [[Algeria]], [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] women could wear whitework dresses. In [[Ghazni]], Afghanistan, men's smocks could be embroidered with geometric whitework stitching embellished with small circular mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 196–197&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Needlepoint]] (canvaswork) was used for brightly coloured geometrical [[Hazaras|Hazara]] dress panels in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Smocking]] was used for men's smocks in [[Nuristan]] in the [[Hindu Kush]], the black stitching pulling the cloth into vertical bands with zigzag, crisscross and other simple geometric patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 200–201&lt;/ref&gt;

Tambour work, a rapid form of embroidery using a fine ari hook instead of a needle, was one of the techniques used around [[Bokhara]] in Uzbekistan for suzanis.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Sentance, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==

Embroidered motifs often carry symbolic meaning. A widespread symbol across the Islamic world (and also often found on [[Islamic carpet]]s) is the [[tree of life]], signifying birth, growth to maturity, death and rebirth. It can be shown in many forms, such as a deliberately stylised tree, sometimes flanked by pairs of birds or fruits such as pomegranates, or a vase of flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, pp. 70–72, 88–89, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==

Embroidery was important in traditional cultures across the Islamic world. The [[Industrial Revolution]] made colourful clothing available more quickly and more cheaply, displacing crafts such as embroidery.&lt;ref name=Paine177&gt;Paine, pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[masnat]] (enthronement) cloths of [[Hyderabad, India]] were made of velvet, hand-embroidered with glittering [[copper]] thread forming gold- and silver-coloured flowers (formerly actually of those metals). These were made for [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperors and other rulers, and also for the bride and groom to sit on during weddings in Hyderabad. The technique derived from Turkey and Persia. A masnat takes between twelve days and two months to make, and can cost up to 100,000 rupees. Business declined during the 20th century, as fewer traditional cloths were ordered. Wedding providers offered a masnat as part of their service; machine-made cloths edged out handmade ones. As of 2012, only a few elderly masnat makers remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mohammed |first1=Syed |title=Technology rings death knell for masnat makers |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Technology-rings-death-knell-for-masnat-makers/articleshow/11680587.cms?referral=PM |publisher=[[Times of India]] |accessdate=16 December 2015 |date=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The embroidery researcher Sheila Paine concludes her book ''Embroidered Textiles'' by explaining that&lt;ref name=Paine177/&gt;

{{quote|once the social context no longer exists and the beliefs and fears that embroidery promoted or deflected no longer torment, once linen is no longer painfully cultivated, spun and woven, sheep are no longer the mainstay of life and exotic silks from other lands a precious luxury – then traditional embroidery is doomed.&lt;ref name=Paine177/&gt;}}

Among the causes of embroidery's decline are [[politics]] and [[economics]], but Paine suggests that the most powerful factor has been the [[education]] of young women. Embroidery is no longer the only way the young woman in Turkey or Baluchistan can secure her future by winning a husband; instead, she can aspire to a university degree and a career of her own. Paine argues that attempts to reinstate traditional embroidery, as with schools set up in Istanbul and [[Salamanca]], will inevitably fail once the necessary social environment that gave handmade artefacts meaning has collapsed. In future, she states, embroidery will carry individual meaning, as in the West, and perhaps new social purposes, as with the politically significant embroidered dresses of the Palestinians.&lt;ref name=Paine177/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sunbula&gt;{{cite web|title=Craft Traditions of Palestine |url=http://www.sunbula.org/crafttrad.shtml |publisher=Sunbula |accessdate=16 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321111836/http://www.sunbula.org/crafttrad.shtml |archivedate=March 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1072">'''MOCNESS''' is the acronym for ''Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System'' and is a net system for [[plankton]] in the ocean. The system is towed behind a [[research vessel]] with a speed of 1.5 knots and consists of five to twenty nets with a mesh size from 64&amp;nbsp;µm to 3&amp;nbsp;mm and an area of 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which are opened and closed computer controlled at desired depth. The net enables biologists to catch [[zooplankton]] and [[nekton]] in various depth horizons typically anywhere in the upper 500 m of the oceans. All MOCNESS systems are capable of sampling to 6000 meters depth (10,000 psi). The system includes a SeaBird CTD-probe to measure salinity and temperature at sampling depths, as well as optional dissolved oxygen, PAR (photosynthetically available light), transmissometry and fluorescence sensors.

{{Fats}}
In [[biochemistry]] and nutrition, '''monounsaturated fatty acids '''(abbreviated '''MUFAs''', or more plainly '''monounsaturated fats''') are [[fatty acids]] that have one [[double bond]] in the fatty acid chain with all of the remainder [[carbon]] [[atom]]s being [[single bond|single-bonded]]. By contrast, [[polyunsaturated]] fatty acids (PUFAs) have more than one double bond.

==Molecular description==
[[Fatty acid]]s are long-chained [[molecule]]s having an [[alkyl]] group at one end and a [[carboxylic acid]] group at the other end. Fatty acid [[viscosity]] (thickness) and [[melting point|melting temperature]] increases with decreasing number of double bonds; therefore, monounsaturated fatty acids have a higher melting point than polyunsaturated fatty acids (more double bonds) and a lower melting point than [[saturated fat|saturated]] fatty acids (no double bonds). Monounsaturated fatty acids are liquids at room temperature and semisolid or solid when refrigerated resulting in a isotopic lattice structure.

Common monounsaturated fatty acids are [[palmitoleic acid]] (16:1&amp;nbsp;n&amp;minus;7), cis-vaccenic acid (18:1&amp;nbsp;n&amp;minus;7) and [[oleic acid]] (18:1&amp;nbsp;n&amp;minus;9). Palmitoleic acid has 16 carbon atoms with the first double bond occurring 7 carbon atoms away from the methyl group (and 9 carbons from the carboxyl end). It can be lengthened to the 18-carbon [[cis-vaccenic acid]]. Oleic acid has 18 carbon atoms with the first double bond occurring 9 carbon atoms away from the carboxylic acid group. The illustrations below show a molecule of oleic acid in Lewis formula and as a [[space-filling model]].

Monounsaturated fats protect against cardiovascular disease by providing more [[biological membrane|membrane]] fluidity than saturated fats, but they are more vulnerable to [[lipid peroxidation]] ([[rancidification|rancidity]]). The large scale KANWU study found that increasing monounsaturated fat and decreasing saturated fat intake could improve insulin sensitivity, but only when the overall fat intake of the diet was low.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Vessby B, Uusitupa M, Hermansen K, Riccardi G, Rivellese AA, Tapsell LC, Nälsén C, Berglund L, Louheranta A, Rasmussen BM, Calvert GD, Maffetone A, Pedersen E, Gustafsson IB, Storlien LH | title = Substituting dietary saturated for monounsaturated fat impairs insulin sensitivity in healthy men and women: The KANWU Study | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 312–9 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11317662 | doi = 10.1007/s001250051620 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some monounsaturated fatty acids (in the same way as saturated fats) may promote [[insulin resistance]], whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids may be protective against insulin resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lovejoy JC | title = The influence of dietary fat on insulin resistance | journal = Current Diabetes Reports | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = 435–40 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12643169 | doi = 10.1007/s11892-002-0098-y }}

Studies have shown that substituting dietary monounsaturated fat for saturated fat is associated with increased daily physical activity and resting energy expenditure. More physical activity was associated with a higher-oleic acid diet than one of a [[palmitic acid]] diet. From the study, it is shown that more monounsaturated fats lead to less anger and irritability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kien CL, Bunn JY, Tompkins CL, Dumas JA, Crain KI, Ebenstein DB, Koves TR, Muoio DM | title = Substituting dietary monounsaturated fat for saturated fat is associated with increased daily physical activity and resting energy expenditure and with changes in mood | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 97 | issue = 4 | pages = 689–97 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23446891 | pmc = 3607650 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.112.051730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levels of [[oleic acid]] along with other monounsaturated fatty acids in red blood cell membranes were positively associated with [[breast cancer]] risk. The [[saturation index]] (SI) of the same membranes was inversely associated with breast cancer risk. Monounsaturated fats and low SI in erythrocyte membranes are predictors of postmenopausal breast cancer. Both of these variables depend on the activity of the enzyme [[delta-9 desaturase]] (Δ9-d).&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Mediterranean diet]] is one heavily influenced by monounsaturated fats. People in Mediterranean countries consume more total fat than Northern European countries, but most of the fat is in the form of monounsaturated fatty acids from olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids from fish, vegetables, and certain meats like lamb, while consumption of saturated fat is minimal in comparison.
A 2017 review found evidence that the practice of a Mediterranean diet could lead to a decreased risk of [[cardiovascular diseases]], overall [[cancer]] incidence, [[neurodegenerative diseases]], [[diabetes]], and [[mortality rate|early death]].&lt;ref name=Dinu2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dinu|first1=M|last2=Pagliai|first2=G|last3=Casini|first3=A|last4=Sofi|first4=F|title=Mediterranean diet and multiple health outcomes: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of observational studies and randomised trials.|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=10 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ejcn.2017.58|pmid=28488692|volume=72|pages=30–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 review showed that the practice of the Mediterranean diet may improve overall health status, such as reduced risk of non-communicable diseases, reduced total [[cost of living|costs of living]], and reduced costs for national [[healthcare]].&lt;ref name="martinez-lacoba2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martinez-Lacoba|first1=R|last2=Pardo-Garcia|first2=I|last3=Amo-Saus|first3=E|last4=Escribano-Sotos|first4=F|title=Mediterranean diet and health outcomes: a systematic meta-review.|journal=European Journal of Public Health|date= 2018|doi=10.1093/eurpub/cky113|pmid=29992229|volume=Advance articles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is based on maintaining coherence across [[Scale (analytical tool)|scales]] and different dimensions (e.g. economic, demographic, energetic) of quantitative assessments generated using different metrics. It is designed to detect and analyze patterns in the societal use of resources and the impacts they create on the environment. The approach was created around 1997 by Mario Giampietro and Kozo Mayumi, and has been developed since then by the members of the IASTE (Integrated Assessment: Sociology, Technology and the Environment) group at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology of the ''Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona'' and its external collaborators. MuSIASEM strives to characterize metabolic patterns of Socio-Ecological Systems (how and why humans use resources and how this use depends on and affects the stability of the ecosystems embedding the society). This integrated approach allows for a quantitative implementation of the [[DPSIR]] framework (Drivers, Pressures, States, Impacts and Responses) and application as a decision support tool. Different alternatives of the option space can be checked in terms of feasibility (compatibility with processes outside human control), viability (compatibility with processes under human control) and desirability (compatibility with normative values and institutions). The ability to integrate quantitative assessments across dimensions and scales makes MuSIASEM particularly suited for different types of sustainability analysis: (i) the nexus between food, energy, water and land uses; (ii) urban metabolism; (iii) waste metabolism; (iv) tourism metabolism; (v) rural development.

==Reception==
[[Meg-John Barker|Meg Barker]], in a review of ''New Directions in Sex Therapy'', wrote "it gives us a much-needed critique of existing ways of understanding, and working with, sex in the therapy room.", and although having concerns about the lack of a chapter on [[bisexuality]] and the apparent underlying assumption that relationships should be sexual, concluded "I hope that this collection will encourage practitioners to critically consider the assumptions and practices that they may be taking for granted, and to start out in a new alternative direction that is truly transformative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cwhn.ca/en/networkmagazine/newdirectionsinsextherapy?page=show |title=Book Review: New Directions in Sex Therapy: Innovations and Alternatives |author=Meg Barker |website=cwhn.ca |publisher=Canadian Women's Health Network |accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5758">'''Nicolaes Jonghelinck''' (1517-1570) was a merchant banker and art collector in [[Antwerp]]. He is best known for his collection of paintings by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and [[Frans Floris]]. His brother was the sculptor [[Jacques Jonghelinck]].
[[File:Bescriivinge_van_de_paelen_der_vriiheiit_van_Antwerpen_-_Iongelinck.jpg|thumb|''Iongelinck''. Fortification listed on map of Antwerp dated 1582]]
In the archives of Antwerp, a writ of guarantee by Jonghelinck, dated 15 February 1566 and declaring to be worth 16.000 [[guilder]]s, for his friend ''Daniel de Bruyne'' lists "sixteen paintings by Bruegel, among them the Tower of Babel, a painting with the title Christ carrying the Cross, the twelve Months of the Year, and all the others whichever they might be". Jonghelinck probably commissioned these paintings though that has not been recorded, for his fortified country house outside of Antwerp that was designed by his brother Jacques in 1547 and sold in 1554 to Nicolaes. It can still be seen on a map dated 1582 though it was destroyed during the [[Fall of Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian Vöhringer – ''Pieter Bruegel. 1525/30-1569'', Tandem Verlag 2007 (h.f.ullmann imprint) S. 116f {{ISBN|978-3-8331-3852-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Months of the Year==
Though it is known that Jonghelinck owned 16 paintings by Bruegel at the time of his death, the specific list is unknown and for many years art historians assumed that this cycle of paintings included either four panels for the four seasons or twelve panels for all twelve months. Now it is assumed they represent six bi-monthly pairs, with one missing.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/261005 record 261005] for ''Hunters in the Snow'' in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; They are assumed to be a continuation of an older tradition to make cyclical images of the [[Labours of the Months]], but they were hung by Jonghelinck in his chateau and therefore may simply have been ordered as wall decorations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/28954879/Plus_semper_quam_pingitur_The_Catholic_Bruegel Plus semper quam pingitur: The Catholic Bruegel] by German art historian Nils Büttner&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==The Tower of Babel==
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Tower of Babel (Vienna) - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|[[The Tower of Babel (Bruegel)|Tower of Babel]]]]
Bruegel's ''Tower of Babel'' is one of several paintings in the possession of Jonghelinck that came into the collection of the City of Antwerp and later found their way into the Austrian Imperial collection of Vienna through [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khm.at/objektdb/detail/323 Turmbau zu Babel] on museum website&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller version by Breugel's hand is in Rotterdam, dated to the same period, which indicates the popularity of the subject in Jonghelinck's day.

==The Procession to Calvary==
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 007.jpg|thumb|[[The Procession to Calvary (Bruegel)|The Procession to Calvary]]]]
[[Michael Francis Gibson]] wrote an art-historical book entitled ''The Mill and the Cross,'' which served as the basis for the 2011 film ''[[The Mill and the Cross]],'' directed by [[Lech Majewski (film director)|Lech Majewski]].  The film sets into their historical context in sixteenth-century Flanders the characters in the painting and the circumstances of the painting's creation.  The films stars [[Rutger Hauer]] as Bruegel and [[Michael York]] as his patron Jonghelinck.

==Labours of Hercules==
[[File:Hercules Killing the Lernean Hydra.jpg|thumb|Hercules Killing the Lernean Hydra]]
Another artist in the collection of Jonghelinck was [[Frans Floris]], who made ten panels of the [[Labours of Hercules]] (which are now lost and only known through later engravings).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1519665&amp;partId=1 The Labours of Hercules] on the [[British Museum]] website&lt;/ref&gt; Floris also made seven compositions on the liberal arts for Jonghelinck, which were later exported to Genua.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1521662&amp;partId=1 Seven Liberal Arts / Grammatica] on the [[British Museum]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Nicolaas Jonghelinck is listed as the first owner in 1566 (referring to the writ of guarantee above) for several of the paintings that have survived in the Austrian Imperial collection and are still in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] today. For example, the record for ''The Gloomy Day'', or ''Düsterer Tag (Vorfrühling)'', shows in their provenance record ''Nicolaas Jongelinck; 1594 Geschenk der Stadt Antwerpen an [[Archduke Ernest of Austria|Erzherzog Ernst]]; 1595 Nachlass Erzherzog Ernst; [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II.]]; Slg. [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria|Leopold Wilhelm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khm.at/objektdb/detail/325/ Düsterer Tag (Vorfrühling)] on museum website&lt;/ref&gt;

The conversion of nitrogen can be carried out through both biological and physical processes.

The nitrogen cycle is of particular interest to [[ecologist]]s because nitrogen availability can affect the rate of key ecosystem processes, including [[primary production]] and [[decomposition]].

[[File:Nitrogen cycle.jpg|Nitrogen cycle|thumb|320px|Classical representation of nitrogen cycle]]

== Processes ==
Nitrogen is present in the environment in a wide variety of chemical forms including organic nitrogen, [[ammonium]] (NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}), [[nitrite]] (NO{{su|b=2|p=−}}), [[nitrate]] (NO{{su|b=3|p=−}}), [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[nitric oxide]] (NO) or inorganic nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Organic nitrogen may be in the form of a living organism, [[humus]] or in the intermediate products of organic matter decomposition. The processes in the nitrogen cycle is to transform nitrogen from one form to another. Many of those processes are carried out by [[microorganism|microbes]], either in their effort to harvest energy or to accumulate nitrogen in a form needed for their growth. For example, the [[metabolic waste#Nitrogen wastes|nitrogenous wastes]] in animal [[urine]] are broken down by [[nitrifying bacteria]] in the soil to be used as new. The diagram {besides} alongside shows how these processes fit together to form the nitrogen cycle.

=== Nitrogen fixation ===
{{Main article|Nitrogen fixation}}
The conversion of nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into nitrates and nitrites through atmospheric, industrial and biological processes is called nitrogen fixation. 
Atmospheric nitrogen must be processed, or "[[nitrogen fixation|fixed]]", into a usable form to be taken up by plants. Between 5x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; and 10x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; g per year are fixed by [[lightning]] strikes, but most fixation is done by free-living or [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[bacterium|bacteria]] known as [[diazotrophs]]. These bacteria have the [[nitrogenase]] [[enzyme]] that combines gaseous nitrogen with [[hydrogen]] to produce [[ammonia]], which is converted by the bacteria into other [[organic compound]]s. Most biological nitrogen fixation occurs by the activity of Mo-nitrogenase, found in a wide variety of bacteria and some [[Archaea]]. Mo-nitrogenase is a complex two-component [[enzyme]] that has multiple metal-containing prosthetic groups.&lt;ref name= MoirJWB&gt;{{cite book | author= Moir, JWB (editor) | year=2011 | title=Nitrogen Cycling in Bacteria: Molecular Analysis | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-86-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of free-living bacteria is ''[[Azotobacter]]''.  Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as ''[[Rhizobium]]'' usually live in the root nodules of [[legumes]] (such as peas, alfalfa, and locust trees). Here they form a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with the plant, producing ammonia in exchange for [[carbohydrate]]s. Because of this relationship, legumes will often increase the nitrogen content of nitrogen-poor soils. A few non-legumes can also form such [[symbiosis|symbioses]]. Today, about 30% of the total fixed nitrogen is produced industrially using the [[Haber-Bosch]] process,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, B., R. L. Richards, and W. E. Newton. 2004. Catalysts for nitrogen fixation : nitrogenases, relevant chemical models and commercial processes. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht ; Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; which uses high temperatures and pressures to convert nitrogen gas and a hydrogen source (natural gas or petroleum) into ammonia.&lt;ref name=Smil&gt;{{cite book |author=Smil, V |year=2000 |title=Cycles of Life |publisher=Scientific American Library, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assimilation ===
{{Main article|Assimilation (biology)|Nitrogen assimilation}}
Plants can absorb nitrate or ammonium from the soil via their root hairs. If nitrate is absorbed, it is first reduced to nitrite ions and then ammonium ions for incorporation into amino acids, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll.&lt;ref name=Smil/&gt; In plants that have a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia, some nitrogen is assimilated in the form of ammonium ions directly from the nodules. It is now known that there is a more complex cycling of amino acids between ''Rhizobia'' bacteroids and plants. The plant provides amino acids to the bacteroids so ammonia assimilation is not required and the bacteroids pass amino acids (with the newly fixed nitrogen) back to the plant, thus forming an interdependent relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willey|first=Joanne M.|title=Prescott's Microbiology 8th Ed|year=2011|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-07-337526-7|pages=705}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many animals, fungi, and other [[heterotrophic]] organisms obtain nitrogen by ingestion of [[amino acid]]s, [[nucleotide]]s, and other small organic molecules, other heterotrophs (including many [[bacteria]]) are able to utilize inorganic compounds, such as ammonium as sole N sources.  Utilization of various N sources is carefully regulated in all organisms.

=== Ammonification ===
When a plant or animal dies or an animal expels waste, the initial form of nitrogen is [[organic matter|organic]]. Bacteria or fungi convert the organic nitrogen within the remains back into [[ammonium]] (NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}), a process called ammonification or [[Mineralization (soil)|mineralization]]. Enzymes involved are:
* GS: Gln Synthetase (Cytosolic &amp; Plastic)
* GOGAT: Glu 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase ([[Ferredoxin]] &amp; NADH-dependent)
* GDH: Glu Dehydrogenase:
** Minor Role in ammonium assimilation.
** Important in amino acid catabolism.

=== Nitrification ===
{{Main article|Nitrification}}
The conversion of ammonium to nitrate is performed primarily by soil-living bacteria and other nitrifying bacteria. In the primary stage of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium (NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}) is performed by bacteria such as the ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'' species, which converts ammonia to [[nitrites]] ({{NO2-}}). Other bacterial species such as ''[[Nitrobacter]]'', are responsible for the oxidation of the nitrites ({{NO2-}}) into [[nitrates]] ({{NO3-}}).&lt;ref name=Smil/&gt; It is important for the ammonia ({{NH3}}) to be converted to nitrates or nitrites because ammonia gas is toxic to plants.

Due to their very high [[solubility]] and because soils are highly unable to retain [[anions]], nitrates can enter [[groundwater]]. Elevated nitrate in groundwater is a concern for drinking water use because nitrate can interfere with blood-oxygen levels in infants and cause [[methemoglobinemia]] or blue-baby syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nitrogen Cycle|url=http://extension.missouri.edu/p/WQ252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vitousek&gt;{{cite journal |year=1997 |title= Human alteration of the global nitrogen cycle: Sources and consequences |journal=Issues in Ecology |volume=1 |pages=1–17 |author1=Vitousek, PM |author2=Aber, J |author3=Howarth, RW |author4=Likens, GE |author5=Matson, PA |author6=Schindler, DW |author7=Schlesinger, WH |author8=Tilman, GD | doi=10.1890/1051-0761(1997)007[0737:HAOTGN]2.0.CO;2 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where groundwater recharges stream flow, nitrate-enriched groundwater can contribute to [[eutrophication]], a process that leads to high algal population and growth, especially blue-green algal populations. While not directly toxic to fish life, like ammonia, nitrate can have indirect effects on fish if it contributes to this eutrophication. Nitrogen has contributed to severe eutrophication problems in some water bodies. Since 2006, the application of nitrogen [[fertilizer]] has been increasingly controlled in Britain and the United States. This is occurring along the same lines as control of phosphorus fertilizer, restriction of which is normally considered essential to the recovery of eutrophied waterbodies.

=== Denitrification ===
{{Main|Denitrification}}
Denitrification is the reduction of nitrates back into nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), completing the nitrogen cycle. This process is performed by bacterial species such as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' and ''[[Clostridium]]'' in anaerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=Smil/&gt; They use the nitrate as an electron acceptor in the place of oxygen during respiration. These facultatively (meaning optionally) anaerobic bacteria can also live in aerobic conditions. Denitrification happens in anaerobic conditions e.g. waterlogged soils. The denitrifying bacteria use nitrates in the soil to carry out respiration and consequently produce nitrogen gas, which is inert and unavailable to plants.

=== Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium ===
{{Main|Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium}}
Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium&amp;nbsp;(DNRA), or nitrate/nitrite ammonification, is an [[anaerobic respiration]]&amp;nbsp;process.&amp;nbsp;Microbes which undertake DNRA oxidise organic matter and use nitrate as an electron acceptor, reducing it to&amp;nbsp;[[nitrite]], then&amp;nbsp;[[ammonium]]&amp;nbsp;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;→NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;→NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lam, Phyllis and Kuypers, Marcel M. M.|first=|date=2011|title=Microbial Nitrogen Processes in Oxygen Minimum Zones|url=|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|volume=3|pages=317–345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both denitrifying and nitrate ammonification bacteria will be competing for nitrate in the environment, although DNRA acts to conserve bioavailable nitrogen as soluble ammonium rather than producing dinitrogen gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marchant, H. K., Lavik, G., Holtappels, M., and Kuypers, M. M. M.|first=|date=2014|title=The Fate of Nitrate in Intertidal Permeable Sediments|url=|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=8|pages=e104517|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0104517|pmid=25127459|pmc=4134218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anaerobic ammonia oxidation ===
{{Main article|Ammonia}}
In this biological process, [[nitrite]] and [[ammonia]] are converted directly into molecular [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas. This process makes up a major proportion of nitrogen conversion in the oceans.  The balanced formula for this "[[anammox]]" chemical reaction is:  NH{{su|b=4|p=+}} + NO{{su|b=2|p=−}} &amp;rarr; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (Δ''G''° = {{val|-357 |u=kJ.mol-1}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anammox|url=https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Anammox|website=Anammox - MicrobeWiki|publisher=MicrobeWiki|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other processes ===

==Marine nitrogen cycle==

[[File:Marine Nitrogen Cycle.jpg|thumb|A schematic representing the Marine Nitrogen Cycle]]
The nitrogen cycle is an important process in the ocean as well. While the overall cycle is similar, there are different players&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moulton |first1=Orissa M |last2=Altabet |first2=Mark A |last3=Beman |first3=J Michael |last4=Deegan |first4=Linda A |last5=Lloret |first5=Javier |last6=Lyons |first6=Meaghan K |last7=Nelson |first7=James A |last8=Pfister |first8=Catherine A |title=Microbial associations with macrobiota in coastal ecosystems: patterns and implications for nitrogen cycling |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |date=May 2016 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=200–208 |doi=10.1002/fee.1262 |url=https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/fee.1262 |language=en |issn=1540-9295}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modes of transfer for nitrogen in the ocean. Nitrogen enters the water through the precipitation, runoff, or as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere. Nitrogen cannot be utilized by [[phytoplankton]] as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; so it must undergo nitrogen fixation which is performed predominately by [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name="Miller 2008 60–62"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Charles|title=Biological Oceanography|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|location=350 Main Street, Malden, MA 02148 USA|isbn=978-0-632-05536-4|pages=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without supplies of fixed nitrogen entering the marine cycle, the fixed nitrogen would be used up in about 2000 years.&lt;ref name="Gruber 2008 1–35"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gruber|first=Nicolas|title=Nitrogen in the Marine Environment|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|location=30 Corporate Drive, Suite 400, Burlington, MA 01803|isbn=978-0-12-372522-6|pages=1–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phytoplankton need nitrogen in biologically available forms for the initial synthesis of organic matter.  Ammonia and urea are released into the water by excretion from plankton. Nitrogen sources are removed from the [[Photic zone|euphotic zone]] by the downward movement of the organic matter. This can occur from sinking of phytoplankton, vertical mixing, or sinking of waste of vertical migrators. The sinking results in ammonia being introduced at lower depths below the euphotic zone. Bacteria are able to convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate but they are inhibited by light so this must occur below the euphotic zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Charles|title=Biological oceanography|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|location=350 Main Street, Malden, MA 02148 USA|isbn=978-0-632-05536-4|pages=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonification or [[Mineralization (geology)|Mineralization]] is performed by bacteria to convert organic nitrogen to ammonia. [[Nitrification]] can then occur to convert the ammonium to nitrite and nitrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyes, Elliot|first=Susan, Michael|title=Learning Unit: Nitrogen Cycle Marine Environment|url=http://www.chemgapedia.de/vsengine/vlu/vsc/en/ch/16/uc/vlus/nitrogenmarine.vlu.html|accessdate=22 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415123617/http://www.chemgapedia.de/vsengine/vlu/vsc/en/ch/16/uc/vlus/nitrogenmarine.vlu.html|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrate can be returned to the euphotic zone by vertical mixing and upwelling where it can be taken up by phytoplankton to continue the cycle. N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be returned to the atmosphere through [[denitrification]].

Ammonium is thought to be the preferred source of fixed nitrogen for phytoplankton because its assimilation does not involve a [[redox]] reaction and therefore requires little energy. Nitrate requires a redox reaction for assimilation but is more abundant so most phytoplankton have adapted to have the enzymes necessary to undertake this reduction ([[nitrate reductase]]). There are a few notable and well-known exceptions that include [[Prochlorococcus]] and some [[Synechococcus]].&lt;ref name="Gruber 2008 1–35"/&gt; These species can only take up nitrogen as ammonium.

The nutrients in the ocean are not uniformly distributed. Areas of upwelling provide supplies of nitrogen from below the euphotic zone. Coastal zones provide nitrogen from runoff and upwelling occurs readily along the coast. However, the rate at which nitrogen can be taken up by phytoplankton is decreased in [[oligotrophic]] waters year-round and temperate water in the summer resulting in lower primary production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lalli, Parsons|first=Carol, Timothy|title=Biological oceanography: An introduction|year=1997|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-7506-3384-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of the different forms of nitrogen varies throughout the oceans as well.

Nitrate is depleted in near-surface water except in upwelling regions. Coastal upwelling regions usually have high nitrate and [[chlorophyll]] levels as a result of the increased production. However, there are regions of high surface nitrate but low chlorophyll that are referred to as [[HNLC]] (high nitrogen, low chlorophyll) regions. The best explanation for HNLC regions relates to iron scarcity in the ocean, which may play an important part in ocean dynamics and nutrient cycles. The input of iron varies by region and is delivered to the ocean by dust (from dust storms) and leached out of rocks. Iron is under consideration as the true limiting element to ecosystem productivity in the ocean.

Ammonium and nitrite show a maximum concentration at 50–80 m (lower end of the euphotic zone) with decreasing concentration below that depth. This distribution can be accounted for by the fact that nitrite and ammonium are intermediate species. They are both rapidly produced and consumed through the water column.&lt;ref name="Gruber 2008 1–35"/&gt; The amount of ammonium in the ocean is about 3 orders of magnitude less than nitrate.&lt;ref name="Gruber 2008 1–35"/&gt; Between ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate, nitrite has the fastest turnover rate. It can be produced during nitrate assimilation, nitrification, and denitrification; however, it is immediately consumed again.

===New vs. regenerated nitrogen===
Nitrogen entering the euphotic zone is referred to as new nitrogen because it is newly arrived from outside the productive layer.&lt;ref name="Miller 2008 60–62"/&gt; The new nitrogen can come from below the euphotic zone or from outside sources. Outside sources are upwelling from deep water and nitrogen fixation. If the organic matter is eaten, respired, delivered to the water as ammonia, and re-incorporated into organic matter by phytoplankton it is considered recycled/regenerated production.&lt;br /&gt;New production is an important component of the marine environment. One reason is that only continual input of new nitrogen can determine the total capacity of the ocean to produce a sustainable fish harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lalli, Parsons|first=Carol, Timothy|title=Biological Oceanography: An introduction|year=1997|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-7506-3384-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvesting fish from regenerated nitrogen areas will lead to a decrease in nitrogen and therefore a decrease in primary production. This will have a negative effect on the system. However, if fish are harvested from areas of new nitrogen the nitrogen will be replenished.

==Human influences on the nitrogen cycle==
{{Main article|Human impact on the nitrogen cycle}}
As a result of extensive cultivation of legumes (particularly [[soy]], [[alfalfa]], and [[clover]]), growing use of the [[Haber–Bosch process]] in the creation of chemical fertilizers, and pollution emitted by vehicles and industrial plants, human beings have more than doubled the annual transfer of nitrogen into biologically available forms.&lt;ref name="Vitousek"/&gt; In addition, humans have significantly contributed to the transfer of nitrogen trace gases from Earth to the atmosphere and from the land to aquatic systems. Human alterations to the global nitrogen cycle are most intense in developed countries and in Asia, where vehicle emissions and [[industrial agriculture]] are highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holland|first1=Elisabeth A.|last2=Dentener|first2=Frank J.|last3=Braswell|first3=Bobby H.|last4=Sulzman|first4=James M.|title=Contemporary and pre-industrial global reactive nitrogen budgets|journal=Biogeochemistry|volume=46|page=7|year=1999|doi=10.1007/BF01007572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) has risen in the atmosphere as a result of agricultural fertilization, biomass burning, cattle and feedlots, and industrial sources.&lt;ref name=Chapin&gt;Chapin, S. F. III, Matson, P. A., Mooney H. A. 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OOH1H779-7EC&amp;pg=PA345 ''Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology.''] Springer, New York 2002 {{ISBN|0-387-95443-0}}, p.345&lt;/ref&gt; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O has deleterious effects in the [[stratosphere]], where it breaks down and acts as a [[catalyst]] in the destruction of atmospheric [[ozone]]. Nitrous oxide is also a [[greenhouse gas]] and is currently the third largest contributor to [[global warming]], after [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]]. While not as abundant in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, it is, for an equivalent mass, nearly 300 times more potent in its ability to warm the planet.&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE)'' International Biofuels Project Rapid Assessment, 22–25 September 2008, Gummersbach, Germany, R. W. Howarth and S. Bringezu, editors. 2009 [http://cip.cornell.edu/biofuels/ Executive Summary, p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in the atmosphere has tripled as the result of human activities. It is a reactant in the atmosphere, where it acts as an [[aerosol]], decreasing air quality and clinging to water droplets, eventually resulting in [[nitric acid]] ([[Hydrogen|H]][[nitrate|NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) that produces [[acid rain]]. Atmospheric ammonia and nitric acid also damage respiratory systems.

The very high temperature of lightning naturally produces small amounts of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, but high-temperature [[combustion]] has contributed to a 6- or 7-fold increase in the flux of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere. Its production is a function of combustion temperature - the higher the temperature, the more NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is produced. [[Fossil fuel]] combustion is a primary contributor, but so are biofuels and even the burning of hydrogen. However, the rate that hydrogen is directly injected into the combustion chambers of internal combustion engines can be controlled to prevent the higher combustion temperatures that produce NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.

Ammonia and nitrous oxides actively alter [[atmospheric chemistry]]. They are precursors of [[troposphere|tropospheric]] (lower atmosphere) ozone production, which contributes to [[smog]] and [[acid rain]], damages [[plant]]s and increases nitrogen inputs to ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Smil04&gt;{{cite book |author=Smil, V |year=2004|isbn=978-0-7567-7350-2 |title=Cycles Of Life: Civilization And The Biosphere |publisher=Diane Pub Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecosystem]] processes can increase with [[nitrogen fertilization]], but [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] input can also result in nitrogen saturation, which weakens productivity and can damage the health of plants, animals, fish, and humans.&lt;ref name=Vitousek/&gt;

Decreases in [[biodiversity]] can also result if higher nitrogen availability increases nitrogen-demanding grasses, causing a degradation of nitrogen-poor, species-diverse [[Heath (habitat)|heathlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=20038308|author1=Aerts, Rien  |author2=Berendse, Frank |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Vegetatio|volume=76|year=1988|issue=1/2|title=The Effect of Increased Nutrient Availability on Vegetation Dynamics in Wet Heathlands|pages=63–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental impacts===
Increasing levels of [[Deposition (aerosol physics)|nitrogen deposition]] are shown to have a number of negative effects on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bobbink|first=R.|last2=Hicks|first2=K.|last3=Galloway|first3=J.|last4=Spranger|first4=T.|last5=Alkemade|first5=R.|last6=Ashmore|first6=M.|last7=Bustamante|first7=M.|last8=Cinderby|first8=S.|last9=Davidson|first9=E.|date=2010-01-01|title=Global assessment of nitrogen deposition effects on terrestrial plant diversity: a synthesis|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=30–59|doi=10.1890/08-1140.1|issn=1939-5582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrogen gases and aerosols can be directly toxic to certain plant species, affecting the aboveground physiology and growth of plants near large [[Point source pollution|point sources]] of nitrogen pollution. Changes to plant species interactions may also occur, as accumulation of nitrogen compounds increase its availability in a given ecosystem, eventually changing the species composition, plant diversity, and nitrogen cycling. Ammonia and ammonium - two reduced forms of nitrogen - can be detrimental over time due to an increased toxicity toward sensitive species of plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Britto|first=Dev T.|last2=Kronzucker|first2=Herbert J.|title=NH4+ toxicity in higher plants: a critical review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0176161704702667|journal=Journal of Plant Physiology|volume=159|issue=6|pages=567–584|doi=10.1078/0176-1617-0774|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly those that are accustomed to using nitrate as their source of nitrogen, causing poor development of their roots and shoots. Increased nitrogen deposition also leads to soil acidification, which increases base cation leaching in the soil and amounts of aluminium and other potentially toxic metals, along with decreasing the amount of [[nitrification]] occurring and increasing plant-derived litter. Due to the ongoing changes caused by high nitrogen deposition, an environment's susceptibility to ecological stress and disturbance - such as pests and pathogens - may increase, thus making it less resilient to situations that otherwise would have little impact to its long-term vitality. 

Additional risks posed by increased availability of inorganic nitrogen in aquatic ecosystems include water acidification; [[eutrophication]] of fresh and saltwater systems; and toxicity issues for animals, including humans.&lt;ref&gt;Camargo, J.A. &amp; Alonso, A. (2006). Ecological and toxicological effects of inorganic nitrogen pollution in aquatics ecosystems: A global assessment. Retrieved December 10, 2010, from http://www.aseanenvironment.info/Abstract/41013039.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Eutrophication often leads to lower dissolved oxygen levels in the water column, including hypoxic and anoxic conditions, which can cause death of aquatic fauna. Relatively sessile benthos, or bottom-dwelling creatures, are particularly vulnerable because of their lack of mobility, though large fish kills are not uncommon. Oceanic [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]] near the mouth of the Mississippi in the Gulf of Mexico are a well-known example of algal bloom-induced [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.33.010802.150513|author=[[Nancy Rabalais|Rabalais, Nancy N.]], R.

The New York Adirondack Lakes, [[Catskills]], Hudson Highlands, Rensselaer Plateau and parts of Long Island display the impact of nitric acid rain deposition, resulting in the killing of fish and many other aquatic species.&lt;ref&gt;New York State Environmental Conservation, Environmental Impacts of Acid Deposition: Lakes [http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/8631.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is highly toxic to fish and the level of ammonia discharged from wastewater treatment facilities must be closely monitored. To prevent fish deaths, nitrification via [[aeration]] prior to discharge is often desirable. Land application can be an attractive alternative to the aeration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="751">'''One-compartment kinetics''' for a chemical compound specifies that the uptake in the compartment is proportional to the concentration outside the compartment, and the elimination is proportional to the concentration inside the compartment. Both the compartment and the environment outside the compartment are considered to be homogeneous (well mixed).The compartment typically represents some organism (e.g. a fish or a [[Daphnia|daphnid]]).

This model is used in the simplest versions of the [[DEBtox]] method for the quantification of effects of toxicants.

'''Paleoneurobiology''' is the study of [[brain evolution]] by analysis of brain [[endocast]]s to determine [[endocranium|endocranial]] traits and volumes. Considered a subdivision of [[neuroscience]], paleoneurobiology combines techniques from other fields of study including [[paleontology]] and [[archaeology]].  It reveals specific insight concerning [[human evolution]]. The cranium is unique in that it grows in response to the growth of brain [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] rather than genetic guidance, as is the case with [[bone]]s that support movement. Fossil [[skull]]s and their endocasts can be compared to each other, to the skulls and fossils of recently deceased individuals, and even compared to those of other species to make inferences about functional [[anatomy]], [[physiology]] and [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]]. Paleoneurobiology is in large part influenced by developments in [[neuroscience]] as a whole; without substantial knowledge about current functionality, it would be impossible to make inferences about the functionality of ancient [[brain]]s.&lt;ref name="BrunerFossilTraces"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Emiliano|title=Fossil traces of the human thought: paleoneurobiology and the evolution of the genus Homo|journal=Journal of Anthropologia Sciences|year=2003|volume=81|pages=29–56|url=http://www.emilianobruner.it/pdf/Paleoneuro03.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Primate skull series with legend cropped.png|thumb|Primate skull series]]Humans have had a long interest in the brain and its functions. The first recorded study of the brain and its functions was from a papyrus text written by the [[Ancient egypt|ancient Egyptians]] during the 17th century BCE. The document details 48 medical ailments and makes references to how to deal with head wounds.  Much later in the 6th century BCE the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] began to focus on studies of the brain and the relationship between the [[optic nerve]] and the brain. Studies of brain evolution, however, did not come about until much later in human history.&lt;ref name="Holloway" /&gt;

Comparative anatomy  began its emergence in the latter part of the 19th century. Two main views of life sprung forth; [[rationalism]] and [[transcendentalism]]. These formed the basis for the thought of scientists in this period. [[Georges Cuvier]] and Étienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire were leaders in the new field of [[comparative anatomy]]. Cuvier believed in the ability to create a functional morphology based simply on [[empiricism|empirical]] evidence. He stressed function of the organ must coincide with its form. Geoffroy, in contrast, put a heavy emphasis on intuition as a method of understanding. His thought was based on two principles: the principle of connections and the principle of unity of plan. Geoffroy was one of the first to look for homologies in organs across species, though he believed that this was evidence of a universal plan rather than descent with modification.&lt;ref name="Holloway" /&gt;

The late part of the 19th century in comparative anatomy was heavily influenced by the work of [[Charles Darwin]] in the ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859. This work completely changed the views of comparative anatomists. Within 8 years of Darwin's release of the ''Origin of Species'', his views on descent from a common ancestor were widely accepted. This led to a shift in trying to understand how different parts of the brain evolved.&lt;ref name="Holloway" /&gt; The next major innovation that helped to bring about paleoneurobiology was the [[microscope]].  Although the microscope was invented in the 17th century, it was only used in biology in the beginning in the late 19th century. The techniques of observing brain cells under a microscope took a long time to refine. In 1873, with this tool in hand, [[Camillo Golgi]] began to cellularly detail the brain and employ techniques to perfect axonal microscoping. [[Ludwig Edinger]] took advantage of this and came up with a new branch of anatomy called comparative neuroanatomy. Edinger held that vertebrates evolved in a linear progressive series. He also thought that changes in the brain were based on a series of additions and differentiations and that the most highly, complex brains were those that were the most encephalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Northcutt|first=Glen|title=Changing Views of Brain Evolution|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|date=August 2001|volume=55|issue=6|pages=663–674|doi=10.1016/S0361-9230(01)00560-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The period of 1885-1935 was an explosion of ideas in comparative neuroanatomy. This era culminated in the publication of "The Comparative Anatomy of the Nervous System" by Arienns, Kappers, Huber, and Cosby. This paper influenced Tilly Edinger and she later became to founder of Paleoneurobiology.&lt;ref name="Holloway"/&gt;

===Tilly Edinger===
{{main|Tilly Edinger}}
Ottilie "Tilly" Edinger was born in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], Germany in 1897. Her father Ludwig Edinger, himself a pioneer in comparative neurology, provided Tilly with invaluable exposure to his field and the scientific community at large. Tilly had many private tutors before attending Schiller-Schule, the only secondary school for girls in Frankfurt at that time. Tilly Edinger continued her schooling with university studies in [[zoology]], [[geology]], and paleontology. While preparing her doctoral dissertation, Edinger encountered a natural brain endocast of ''[[Nothosaurus]]'', a marine reptile from the Mesozoic era. Edinger's first paper, published in 1921, centered on the characteristics of the ''Nothosaurus'' specimen. Prior to the publication of her work, inferences about the evolution of the vertebrate brain were made exclusively through [[comparative anatomy]] of extant fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, and mammal brains. Tilly Edinger's background in [[neurology]] and paleontology paved the way for her to integrate comparative anatomy and [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic sequence]], thus introducing the concept of time to neurology and creating the field of paleoneurobiology. The field was formally defined with the publication of ''Die fossilen Gehirne'' (''Fossil Brains'') in 1929 which compiled knowledge on the subject that had previously been scattered in a wide variety of journals and treated as isolated events.&lt;ref name="BuchholtzEdingerHistory"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchholtz|first1=Emily|last2=Seyfarth|first2=Ernst-August|title=The Study of "Fossil Brains": Tilly Edinger (1897-1967) and the Beginnings of Paleoneurology|journal=BioScience|date=August 2001|volume=51|issue=8|pages=674–82|url=http://www.wellesley.edu/Biology/Faculty/Emily/BioScienceEdinger.pdf|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0674:TSOFBT]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While still in Germany, Edinger began studying extant species from a paleoneurobiological perspective by making inferences about evolutionary brain development in [[Sirenia|seacows]] using stratigraphic and comparative anatomical evidence. Edinger continued her research in Nazi Germany until the night of November 9, 1938 when thousands of Jews were killed or imprisoned in what became known as [[Kristallnacht]]. Although a visa was not immediately available for immigration to the United States, with the help of friends and colleagues who valued her work, Edinger was able to immigrate to London where she translated German medical texts into English. Eventually her visa quota number was called and she was able to immigrate to the United States where she took on a position as a research fellow at Harvard's [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]].&lt;ref name="BuchholtzEdingerHistory"/&gt;

Her contributions to the field of paleoneurobiology include determining the extent to which endocasts reflect the anatomy of ancient brains, the adequacy of comparative anatomy to interpret brain evolution, the ability of brain endocasts to predict the lifestyles of extinct organisms, and if brain size has increased over geological time; topics which are still being explored today. In her later years, Edinger corresponded with the next generation of paleoneurobiologists, which insured that the work from her 50-year career continued into the future. The pinnacle accomplishment of her career was the compilation of an annotated bibliography of paleoneurobiological papers published between 1804 and 1966. The bibliography, ''Paleoneurology 1804-1966'', was completed and published by colleagues posthumously in 1975 due to the untimely death of Edinger from injuries sustained during a traffic accident in 1967.&lt;ref name="BuchholtzEdingerHistory"/&gt;

===Conflict between Holloway and Falk===

Paleoneurobiologists [[Ralph Holloway|Ralph L. Holloway]] and [[Dean Falk]] disagree about the interpretation of a depression on the ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' AL 162-28 endocast. Holloway argues that the depression is a result of lipping at the [[lambdoid suture]] and that the [[Sulci (neuroanatomy)|sulcal patterns]] indicate cerebral organization moving toward a more human pattern, while Falk insists that the depression is the [[lunate sulcus]] in a position that is indicative of an ape-like sulcal pattern. The debate between these two scientists is not hinged solely on the AL 162-28 endocast, but rather extends to all [[australopithecine]] fossils, with Holloway insisting on the presence of hominid sulcal features, and Falk maintaining that the features are [[pongid]] in nature. The debate between Holloway and Falk is so intense that between 1983 and 1985, they published four papers on the identification of the medial end of the lunate sulcus of the [[Taung Child|Taung endocast]] (''Australopithecus africanus''), which only further strengthened the division between each scientist's respective opinion. Although there have been no definitive conclusions about the fossils in question, many techniques were created or critically analyzed and refined as a result of the conflict. These new techniques in endocast analysis included the use of stereoplotting to transfer sulci between differently shaped endocasts, measurement of indexes from photographs rather than directly from specimens, and confounding of measurements taken directly from specimens and those taken from photographs.&lt;ref name=Falk/&gt;

==Brain endocasts==

[[File:Head CT scan.jpg|thumb|Normal human brain CT scan]]A brain endocast is the imprintation of the inner features of a cranium that captures the details created from pressure exerted on the skull by the brain itself. Endocasts can be formed naturally by [[sedimentation]] through the [[cranial foramina]] which becomes rock-hard due to calcium deposition over time, or artificially by creating a mold from silicon or latex that is then filled with plaster-of-Paris while sitting in a water bath to equalize forces and retain the original shape. [[Endocast#Natural endocasts|Natural endocasts]] are very rare; most of those that are studied are the result of artificial methods. Although the name implies that it is a copy of the once living brain, endocasts rarely exhibit convolutions due to buffering by the [[pia mater]], [[arachnoid mater]], and [[dura mater]] that once surrounded and protected the brain tissue. Furthermore, not all endocasts are created from a complete cranial fossil and subsequently, the missing parts are approximated based on similar fossils. In some cases, fragments from several fossils of the same species are used to construct a single endocast.&lt;ref name="HollowayBook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Holloway |first= Ralph L. |author2=Douglas C. Broadfield |author3=Michael S. Yuan  |title= The Human Fossil Record, Volume Three: Brain Endocasts--The Paleoneurological Evidence |publisher= [[Wiley-Liss]] |year= 2004 |isbn= 978-0-471-41823-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, [[computed tomography]] has played a large role in reconstructing endocasts. The procedure is non-invasive and has the advantage of being able to analyze a fossil in record time with little risk of damaging the fossil under review. CT imaging is achieved through the application of x-rays to produce [[tomography|tomographs]], or sectional density images, which are similar to the images produced during MRI scans.&lt;ref name="MarinoCTInterview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marino|first1=Lori|last2=Uhen|first2=Mark D.|last3=Pyenson|first3=Nicholas D.|last4=Frohlich|first4=Bruno|title=Reconstructing Cetacean Brain Evolution Using Computed Tomography|journal=The Anatomical Record Part B: The New Anatomist|year=2003|volume=272B|issue=1|pages=107–17|doi=10.1002/ar.b.10018|pmid=12731077}}&lt;/ref&gt; CT scans use slices approximately 1&amp;nbsp;mm thick to reconstruct a virtual model of the specimen.&lt;ref name="FrenchPaper"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poza-Rey|first1=Eva María|last2=Arsuaga|first2=Juan Luis|title=Reconstitution 3D par ''Computerized-tomography'' (CT) et endocrâne virtuel du crâne 5 du site de la Sima de Los Huesos (Atapuerca)|journal=L'Anthropologie |year=2009|volume=113|pages=211–21|doi=10.1016/j.anthro.2008.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is especially useful when a fossil cranium is occupied by a natural endocast that cannot be removed without destroying the skeletal portions of the fossil. Because the cranium and its contents are of different densities, the endocranial cavity and its unique traits can be reconstructed virtually.&lt;ref name="MarinoCTInterview" /&gt;

Radiographic technique such as computed tomographic imaging, or [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]], coupled with computer programing have been used to analyze brain endocasts from as early as 1906.&lt;ref name=Mafart &gt;{{cite journal|last=Mafart|first=Bertrand |author2=Gaspard Guipert |author3=Marie-Antoinette de Lumly |author4=Gerard Subsol|title=Three-dimensional computer imaging on hominid fossils: a new step in human evolution studies|journal=Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal|date=17 May 2004|volume=55|issue=4|pages=264–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent development of advanced computer graphics technology have allowed scientists to more accurately analyze of brain endocasts. M. Vannier and G. Conroy of Washington University School of Medicine have developed a system that images and analyzes surface morphologies in 3D. Scientists are able to encode surface landmarks that allows them to analyze sulcal length, cortical asymmetries and volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vannier|first=M. W.|author2=Conroy, G.C. |author3=Krieg, J. |author4=Falk, D. |title=Three-dimensional imaging for primate biology|journal=Proc. Natl. Comput. Graphics Assoc.|year=1987|volume=3|pages=156–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiologist, paleoanthropologists, computer scientists in both the United States and Europe have collaborated to study such fossils using virtual techniques.&lt;ref name=Mafart /&gt;

==Methods of research==
[[File:MRI EGC sagittal.png|thumb|right|Sagittal view of a human brain through MRI]]Paleoneurobiology revolves around the analysis of endocasts.  Much of this analysis is focused on interpreting [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulcal patterns]], which is difficult because traces are often hardly recognizable, and there are no clear landmarks to use as reference points.  Furthermore, the only clear reference plane is the [[sagittal plane]] one, which is marked by distinct cerebral asymmetries.  Since the obtaining of clear data from fossil details is usually very difficult, much debate arises over interpretations.  Experience is often an important factor in endocast analysis.&lt;ref name="BrunerFossilTraces" /&gt;  Therefore, a large portion of the field of paleoneurobiology arises out of developing more detailed procedures that increase the resolution and the reliability of interpretations.

===Overall brain volume===
Statistical analysis of brain endocasts gives information on the increases in overall brain volume ("endocranial volume"). Because endocasts are not exact replicas, or exact casts, of a once-living brain, computer algorithms and [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]] are needed to calculate endocranial volume. The calculated endocranial volume includes the [[meninges]], [[cerebrospinal fluid]], and [[cranial nerves]]. Therefore, these volumes end up larger than the once-living brain.&lt;ref name=Holloway /&gt; This information is useful for calculating relative brain size, RBS, and [[encephalization quotient]], EQ. The corresponding body weight of the subject must also be known to calculated RBS. RBS is calculated by dividing the weight of the brain by body weight. EQ can be determined several different ways depending on the data set used. For example, Holloway and Post calculate EQ by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;EQ = \operatorname{Brain weight}\over\operatorname{0.12}\cdot\operatorname{Body weight}^{0.66}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Holloway /&gt;

Brain volume is prominent in the scientific literature for discussing [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic identification]], behavioral complexity, intelligence, and dissimilar rates of evolution.&lt;!-- I'd all this OR? "despite being ill-suited for these purposes." --&gt; In modern humans, cranial capacity can vary by as much as 1000 cc, without any correlation to behavior. This degree of variation is almost equivalent to the total increase in volume from australopithecine fossils to modern humans, and brings into question the validity of relying on cranial capacity as a measurement of sophistication.&lt;ref name="HollowayParameters"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holloway|first=Ralph L|title=Cranial Capacity, Neural Reorganization, and Hominid Evolution: A Search for More Suitable Parameters|journal=American Anthropologist|year=1966|volume=68|pages=103–21|doi=10.1525/aa.1966.68.1.02a00090|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many paleoneurobiologists measure cranial capacity via the submersion method, in which displacement of water in a beaker is taken as the volume of the endocast. Scientists who believe that this method is not accurate enough will use a similar procedure in which a beaker with a spout is filled until it is full. The water displaced by the endocast is then weighed to determine the endocast volume. Although both of these techniques are significantly more precise than previous methods, scientists are optimistic that more advanced techniques such as computed tomography will provide greater accuracy of volume measurements.&lt;ref name="HollowayBook" /&gt;

===Morphometric analysis===
[[morphometrics|Morphometric]] analysis relies on [[chord (geometry)|chord]] and arc measurements of the endocast surface. Length, width, [[bregma]]-[[basion]], and height measurements of an endocast are taken with spreading [[caliper]]s.&lt;ref name="HollowayBook" /&gt; [[Frontal lobe]], [[parietal lobe]], and [[occipital lobe]] chord length (the length of the lobe at its widest point along the midsagittal plane) are measured using a dioptograph in which landmarks are projected onto a two-dimensional surface. Measurements may be skewed if the orientation of the endocast has not been properly determined before the dioptograph is made. Geometric morphometrics (systems of coordinates superimposed over the measurements of the endocast) are often applied to allow comparison between specimens of varying size. Measurements may also be taken in reference to [[Broca's area]], height of the endocast at 25% intervals of the maximum length, and the vault module ([[mean]] of maximum length, width, and middle height).&lt;ref name="BrunerMorphometric"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Emiliano|title=Geometric morphometrics and paleoneurology: brain shape evolution in the genus ''Home''|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|year=2004|volume=47|pages=279–303|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.03.009|pmid=15530349|issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.461.2334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although other measurements may be taken, the choice of landmarks are not always consistent between studies.&lt;ref name="HollowayBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BrunerMorphometric" /&gt;

===Convolution pattern and cerebral organization===

Convolutions, the individual [[gyrus|gyri]] and [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] that compose the folds of the brain, are the most difficult aspect of an endocast to accurately assess. The surface of the brain is often referred to as smooth and fuzzy, due to the [[meninges]] and [[vasculature]] that cover the brain's surface. It is possible to observe underlying gyri and sulci patterns if an endocast is accurately or preserved, but the uncertainty associated with these patterns often leads to controversy.&lt;ref name="BrunerFossilTraces" /&gt; Because the [[robust australopithecine]] fossils show these details, convolutions are included in the study of endocasts whenever appropriate.&lt;ref name="HollowayBook" /&gt;

===Asymmetry===
The degree of asymmetry between right and left hemispheres is a point of interest to most paleoneurobiologists because it could be linked to [[handedness]] or language development of the specimen. Asymmetries occur due to [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemispherical]] specialization and are observed in both a qualitative and quantitative manner. The unevenness of the hemispheres, known as a petalia, is characterized by a lobe that is wider and/or protruding beyond the contralateral lobe. For example, a right-handed person typically has larger left occipital lobe and right frontal lobes than the contralateral lobes. Petalias also occur due to specialization in the [[Broca's area|communication centers]] of the [[Frontal lobe|frontal cortex]] of the brain in modern humans. Petalias in the occipital lobe are easier to detect than those in the frontal lobe.&lt;ref name="HollowayBook" /&gt; Certain asymmetries have been documented on ''Homo erectus'' specimens such as the ''Homo redolfensis'' specimen from 1.8 million years ago that resemble the same asymmetries from modern humans.&lt;ref name=Holloway /&gt; Some gorillas have shown strong petalias, but they are not found in combination with other petalias as is almost always the case in humans. Scientists use the presence of petalias to show sophistication, but they are not a definitive indicator of evolution toward a more human brain.&lt;ref name="HollowayBook" /&gt;

===Meningeal patterns===

Although the meninges have no link to behavior, they are still studied within the realm of paleoneurobiology due to the high degree of conservation of meningeal patterns within a species which may serve as a way to determine [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and [[phylogeny]].&lt;ref name="HollowayBook" /&gt;

===Endocranial vasculature===

Because meningeal blood vessels comprise part of the outermost layer of the brain, they often leave vascular grooves in the cranial cavity that are captured in endocasts. Endocranial vasculature originates around the foramina in the skull and in a living body would supply blood to the calvaria  and [[dura mater]]. The vasculature is so well preserved in some fossils that terminal branches of the [[circulatory system]] can be observed. Analysis of cranial vasculature concentrates on the anterior meningeal system of the frontal region, the middle meningeal system of the parieto-temporal and part of the anterior occipital region, and the cerebellar fossa system of the cerebellar region. In the course of hominid evolution, the middle meningeal system has undergone the most change. Although cranial vasculature has been exhaustively studied in the last century, there has been no consensus on an identification scheme for the branches and patterns of the vascular system resulting from little overlap of results between studies. As such, endocranial vasculature is better suited for inferring the amount of blood delivered to different parts of the brain.&lt;ref name="HollowayBookGuest"&gt;{{cite book| first=Dominique |last=Grimaud-Hervé| title= The Human Fossil Record, Volume Three: Brain Endocasts--The Paleoneurological Evidence |editor1-first=Ralph L. |editor1-last=Holloway |editor2-first= Douglas C. |editor2-last=Broadfield| editor3-first=Michael S. |editor3-last=Yuan|chapter=Part Five - Endocranial Vasculature|publisher= [[Wiley-Liss]] |year= 2004 |isbn= 978-0-471-41823-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative lobe size===
It is impossible to determine accurate location of the [[central sulcus|central]] or [[precentral sulcus|precentral]] sulci from an endocast. Still it can provide a rough idea of lobe sizes.&lt;ref name=Holloway /&gt;

==Significance==
The study of paleoneurobiology allows researchers to examine the [[evolution]]ary nature of human [[encephalization]].  Traditionally, paleoneurobiologists have focused on determining the volume of the ancient brain and the patterns that emerged among related species. By finding these measurements, researchers have been able to predict the average body weight of species.  Endocasts also reveal traits of the ancient brain including relative [[lobes of the brain|lobe size]], blood supply, and other general insight into the anatomy of evolving species.&lt;ref name="Holloway"&gt;{{cite web|last=Holloway|first=Ralph|title=Evolution of the Brain in Humans- Paleoneurology|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~rlh2/2009.Holloway_Sherwood_Hof_Rilling.sm.pdf|publisher=Columbia|accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
While paleoneurology is useful in the study of brain evolution, certain limitations to the information this study provides do exist.  The limited scale and completeness of the fossil record inhibits the ability of paleoneurobiology to accurately document the course of brain evolution.&lt;ref name="RogersBehaviors"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Scott W.|title=Reconstructing the Behaviors of Extinct Species: An Excursion Into Comparative Paleoneurology|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics|year=2005|volume=134A|pages=349–56|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.30538|issue=4|pmid=15759265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, fossil preservation is necessary to ensure accuracy of the endocasts studied.&lt;ref name="Bruner Encephalization"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bruner |first1=Emiliano |last2=Manzi |first2=Giorgio |last3=Arsuaga |first3=Juan Luis |title=Encephalization and allometric trajectories in the genus Homo: Evidence from the Neandertal and modern lineages |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=100 |issue=26 |year=2003 |url=http://www.emilianobruner.it/pdf/Bruner2003_PNAS.pdf |doi=10.1073/pnas.2536671100 |isbn=978-2-536-67110-7 |pages=15335–15340 |pmid=14673084 |pmc=307568}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Weathering]], [[erosion]], and overall gradual disfiguration may alter the naturally recovered endocasts or endocasts created from existing fossils.&lt;ref name="Bruner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Emiliano|title=Geometric morphometrics and paleoneurology: brain shape evolution in the genus Homo|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=November 2004|volume=47|issue=5|pages=279–303|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.03.009|url=http://www.emilianobruner.it/pdf/bruner_jhe2004.pdf|pmid=15530349|citeseerx=10.1.1.461.2334}}&lt;/ref&gt; The morphology of the brain can also be difficult to both quanitfy and describe, further complicating the observations made from the study of endocasts.&lt;ref name="Bruner Encephalization" /&gt;  Additionally, paleoneurobiology provides very little insight into the actual [[anatomy]] within the brains of species studied; the study of endocasts is limited to the external anatomy only.  The relationship among endocranial traits remains elusive.  Comparative paleoeneurology reveals mostly only differences in endocranial size among related species, such as [[western gorilla|''Gorilla gorilla'']].  Since there is no proven direct relationship between brain size and intelligence, only inferences can be made regarding the developing behavior of ancient relatives of the genus ''[[Homo]]''.

These limitations of paleoneurobiology are currently being dealt with by the development of more advanced tools to refine the study of endocasts.

==Studies of interest==

===Brain shape, intelligence, and cognitive performance===
Recent studies by Emiliano Bruner, Manuel Martin-Loechesb, Miguel Burgaletac, and Roberto Colomc have investigated the connection between midsagittal brain shape and mental speed. This study incorporated human subjects' cognitive testing in relationship to extinct humans. They used 2D from 102 MRI-scanned young adult human for comparison. Such correlations are small, suggesting that the influence of midsagittal brain geometry on individual cognitive performance is negligible but still provides useful information of evolutionary traits of the brain. Areas associated with the parietal cortex appear to be involved in relationships between brain geometry and mental speed.&lt;ref name="Bruner Midsagittal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Emiliano|author2=Manuel Martin-Loeches |author3=Miguel Burgaleta |author4=Roberto Colom |title=Midsagittal brain shape correlation with intelligence and cognitive performance|journal=Intelligence|date=March–April 2011|volume=39|issue=2–3|pages=141–147|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2011.02.004|url=http://www.cenieh.es/docs/f_Bruneretal2011-Intelligence%28inpress%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degenerative diseases and functional disorder===

Scientist J. Ghika believes use of paleoneurobiology is the best way to analyze several neurodegeneration leading to diseases such as [[Parkinson's disease]], [[dyskinesias]], gait disorders, [[Paget's disease of bone]], [[dysautonomia]] and so on. A past study by S.I. Rapoport on [[Alzheimer's disease]] in Homo sapiens has shown the importance in using a darwinian perspective to better understand this disease itself and its symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rapoport|first=SI|title=Brain evolution and Alzheimer's disease|journal=Review Neurology|year=1988|volume=144|series=Paris|issue=2|pages=79–90|pmid=2898165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The aim is to determine the genetic mechanisms that lead to focal or asymmetrical brain atrophy resulting in syndromic presentations that affect gait, hand movements (any sort of locomotion), language, cognition, mood and behavior disorders. Most risk-factors for neurodegenerative disease places highest priority on aging as causation. Scientists and physicians together can use clinical signs and symptoms to classify different diseases according to the changes taking place in specific brain areas in Homo sapiens leading to physical disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ghika|first=J|title=Paleoneurology: Neurodegenerative diseases are age-related diseases of specific brain regions recently developed by homo sapiens|journal=Medical Hypotheses|date=November 2008|volume=71|issue=5|pages=788–801|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2008.05.034|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987708002831|accessdate=28 September 2011|pmid=18703290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''Paolo Soleri''' (21 June 1919 – 9 April 2013)&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; was an Italian [[architect]]. He established the educational [[Cosanti]] Foundation and [[Arcosanti]]. Soleri was a lecturer in the College of Architecture at [[Arizona State University]] and a [[National Design Award]] recipient in 2006.  He died at home of natural causes on 9 April 2013 at the age of 93.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Soleri authored six books, including ''The Omega Seed'', "Arcology - City In the Image of Man", and numerous essays and monographs.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Early life==
Soleri was born in [[Turin]], [[Italy]], [[Europe]]. He was awarded his "laurea" (master's degree) in [[architecture]] from the [[Politecnico di Torino]] in 1946. He visited the [[United States]] in December 1946 and spent a year and a half in fellowship with [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] at [[Taliesin West]] in Arizona, and at [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] in Spring Green, Wisconsin. During this time, he gained international recognition for a bridge design that was displayed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1950, Soleri, with his wife Colly (née Corolyn Woods), returned to [[Italy]] where he was commissioned to build a large ceramics factory, Ceramica Artistica Solimene, in [[Vietri sul Mare|Vietri]] on the Amalfi coast.&lt;ref name="Solimene Ceramics Factory Video"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFOXomHEZ-w|date=October 15, 2009|accessdate=November 11, 2011|title=Solimene Ceramics Factory Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soleri adapted ceramics industry processes learned at this time to use in his award-winning designs and production of ceramic and bronze windbells and [[silt-cast]] architectural structures. For more than 40 years, proceeds from sales of the wind-bells have been an important source of funds for construction that is meant to test his theoretical work. Ceramic and bronze bells continue to be produced and sold at [[Arcosanti]] and [[Cosanti]] in Arizona.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1956, Soleri settled in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], with Colly and the elder of their two daughters; the younger was born in Arizona. He began building [[Arcosanti]] in 1970 with the help of architecture and design students, as a place to test his urban design hypotheses. This "urban laboratory" (so-dubbed by Ada Louise Huxtable, who at the time was the architectural critic of The NY Times) became internationally renowned.&lt;ref name="karissa"/&gt;

Paolo and Colly Soleri made a lifelong commitment to research and experimentation in [[urban planning]]. They established the Cosanti Foundation, a 501-3C educational non-profit foundation. Soleri's philosophy and works were strongly influenced by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[paleontologist]] and philosopher [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Soleri died on 9 April 2013 and was buried at Arcosanti in its private cemetery, beside his wife.&lt;ref name="karissa"&gt;{{cite web|last=Karissa|first=Rosenfield|title=Remembering Paolo Soleri 1919–2013|url=http://www.archdaily.com/357747/remembering-paolo-soleri-1919-2013/ |work=Architecture Daily|publisher=ArchDaily| accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arcosanti==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
The Cosanti Foundation's major project is [[Arcosanti]]. Arcosanti, as originally designed by Soleri, was intended for 5,000 people; it has been in construction since 1970. Located near Cordes Junction, about {{convert|70|mi|km}} north of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and visible from Interstate I-17 in central [[Arizona]], the intention of the project is to provide a model that can demonstrate Soleri's concept of "[[Arcology]]", [[architecture]] coherent with [[ecology]]. Arcology was envisioned by Soleri as a hyper-dense city, designed to: maximize human interaction with ready access to shared, cost-effective infrastructural services; conserve water and reduce sewage; minimize the use of energy, raw materials and land; reduce waste and [[environmental pollution]]; increase interaction with the surrounding natural environment. In 2010, construction was underway to complete Arcosanti's Greenhouse Apron, but that initiative was put on hold not long after Soleri's death in 2013.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Arcosanti is intended as a prototype of a desert arcology. Soleri's other arcology designs envisioned sites such as the ocean (Nova Noah), ''et al.'' (see: Arcology: City in the Image of Man). Since 1970, over 7000 people have participated in Arcosanti's construction.  Their international affiliation group is called the Arcosanti Alumni Network.&lt;ref&gt;Arcosanti Alumni Network. Retrieved from https://arcosanti.org/node/30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other achievements==
The International Architecture Symposium "Mensch und Raum" (Man and Space) at the [[Vienna University of Technology]] in 1984 received international attention. Paolo Soleri participated with, among others: [[Justus Dahinden]], [[Dennis Sharp]], [[Bruno Zevi]], [[Jorge Glusberg]], [[Otto Kapfinger]], [[Frei Otto]], [[Pierre Vago]], [[Ernst Gisel]], and [[Ionel Schein]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Soleri was a distinguished lecturer in the College of Architecture at [[Arizona State University]] and a member of the [[Lindisfarne Association]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1966, Paolo Soleri began working on the design for the [[Paolo Soleri Amphitheater]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]]. It was built for the IAIA (Institute of American Indian Arts) on what is now the campus of the [[Santa Fe Indian School]] using large silt cast forms. The property is owned by the nineteen Native American Pueblos of New Mexico and is therefore not protected by local or state preservation laws.&lt;ref name="krqe-demolish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/paolo-soleri-to-be-demolished-/|date=June 11, 2010|accessdate=November 11, 2011|title=Paolo Soleri to be demolished|publisher=KRQE.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319150840/http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/paolo-soleri-to-be-demolished-/|archivedate=March 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A landmark exhibition, "City in the Image of Man - The Architectural Visions of Paolo Soleri", organized in 1970 by the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, DC]], traveled extensively thereafter in the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]], breaking records for attendance. "Two Suns Arcology, A Concept for Future Cities" opened in 1976 at the [[Xerox Square Center]] in [[Rochester, New York]]. In 1989, "Paolo Soleri Habitats: Ecologic Minutiae", an exhibition of arcologies, space habitats, and bridges, was presented at the New York Academy of Sciences. More recently, "Soleri's Cities, Architecture for the Planet Earth and Beyond" was featured at the Scottsdale Center for the Arts in [[Scottsdale, AZ]]. A Soleri bell appears in the film [[What the *Bleep* Do We Know?]] His work has been exhibited worldwide.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1976, Paolo Soleri was a key participant at [[UN Habitat I]], the first UN forum on human settlements, held it Vancouver, [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], [[North America]]. Soleri appeared there together with Buckminster Fuller.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The Paolo Soleri Archives, the collection of Soleri's drawings and writings, is located at Arcosanti. The Soleri Archives is managed by Sue Kirsch under the direction of Tomiaki Tamura, a Cosanti Board Trustee and Arcosanti's Director of Special Projects. Tomiaki Tamura resides at Arcosanti.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

An interview with Soleri was featured in the environmental documentary [[The 11th Hour (2007 film)|''The 11th Hour'']] (2007).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

On 10 December 2010, the Soleri Bridge and Plaza was completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottsdalepublicart.org/permanent-art/soleri-bridge-and-plaza Soleri Bridge and Plaza. Retrieved from scottsdalepublicart.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The structure had been commissioned by Scottsdale Public Art. The {{convert|130|ft|m|adj=on}} pedestrian bridge based on Paolo Soleri's design is located on the South Bank of the Arizona Canal and connects a developed retail area of the Scottsdale Waterfront with Old Town Scottsdale. The bridge is incorporated into a {{convert|22,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} plaza including silt cast artwork, as well as a large bell assembly called The Goldwater Bell, also designed by Paolo Soleri.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The feature-length documentary film ''[[The Vision Of Paolo Soleri: Prophet In The Desert]]'' (2013) contains interviews with [[Morley Safer]], [[Paul Goldberger]], [[Catherine Hardwicke]], [[Will Bruder]], [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]], [[Steven Holl]], and [[Eric Lloyd Wright]].&lt;ref name="documentary"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Vision of Paolo Soleri: Prophet in the Desert|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250180/|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual abuse allegation ==
On 13 November 2017, Daniela Soleri—Paolo Soleri's daughter—published an article on the site ''[[Medium (website)|Medium]]'' accusing her father of persistent sexual abuse, writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;"In my early adolescence, my father, an architect and craftsman, began sexually molesting me, eventually attempting rape when I was 17."&lt;ref name="Daniela Medium"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@soleri/sexual-abuse-its-you-him-and-his-work-88ecb8e99648|title=Sexual abuse: It's you, him, and his work|last=Soleri|first=Daniela|date=2017-11-14|website=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Encouraged to publish the article by the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]], Daniela wrote that she had already come forward to many of her father's colleagues but received little response:

{{Quote|I finally told some of Soleri's inner circle about my experiences about 24 years ago, others learned of them six years ago when I tendered my letter of resignation from the board of Soleri's Cosanti Foundation, with an explanation of why. In response to receiving my letter, one of my father's long time colleagues and board member wrote "I am disappointed in everyone." A strange reaction from a man I had known since I was seven. Two years later he presided at a memorial seminar eulogizing Soleri and his work. His message seemed to be that, yes, he's disappointed that those things occurred, but he's equally disappointed that they are being brought up, instead of silenced.&lt;ref name="Daniela Medium" /&gt;}}

In the article, Daniela wrote about her lingering admiration for some of Soleri's work and ideas. However, she also warned against uncritical praise of artists with abusive tendencies and the tendency to "accept abusive behavior as a necessary and justified cost for the contributions of intellect or creativity".&lt;ref name="Daniela Medium" /&gt; Of her father, Daniela wrote:

{{Quote|Soleri has been dead for nearly five years. The swell of hagiographic films, essays and performances has slowed, hopefully making room for a more useful perspective that includes not only consideration of his work, but also honest acknowledgment that he was flawed. That work will have to stand on its own, and not be seen as an inseparable part of Soleri as a person, including his best and worst behaviors.&lt;ref name="Daniela Medium" /&gt;}}

As noted in ''[[Dezeen]]'', Daniela's article suggested that she had approached ''[[The New York Times]]'' or other news publishers to discuss her father's abuse, but had been turned away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2017/12/18/paolo-soleri-sexual-abuse-daughter-daniela-soleri/|title=Paolo Soleri accused of sexual abuse by daughter|last=Gibson|first=Eleanor|date=2017-12-18|website=[[Dezeen]]|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cosanti Foundation Board released an official statement in response to Daniela Soleri's:

{{Quote|We are saddened by Daniela Soleri's trauma. Her decision to speak out about her father's behavior towards her helps us confront Paolo Soleri's flaws, and compels us to reconsider his legacy. With Paolo Soleri's creative intelligence, he understood the need for discipline and limits to the urban form. However, his narcissism prevented him from understanding the need for discipline and limits on abusive behavior. We support and stand firmly with Daniela.

We know that Arcosanti and Cosanti are much greater than the ideas of one man. Over the past fifty years, more than 8,000 participants from all over the world have contributed to Arcosanti and Cosanti through our workshops and programs. Our work in urban planning will continue. It was considered radical fifty years ago and has proven itself relevant today. Our goal is a built environment inspired by Soleri's architecture that fosters community, integrates the natural world, and nurtures the best of human nature.&lt;ref name="Keith Curbed"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.curbed.com/2017/12/15/16781940/paolo-soleri-abuse-daughter-arcosanti|title=Architect Paolo Soleri's daughter Daniela recounts childhood abuse in open letter|last=Keith|first=Kelsey|date=2017-12-15|website=[[Curbed]]|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[Curbed]]'' editor-in-chief Kelsey Keith wrote "[Daniela] Soleri's account is breathtaking not only for its thorough and very personal reckoning with the truth, but for its clear-eyed articulation of the reasons why assigning all intellectual power to a solitary genius is so harmful."&lt;ref name="Keith Curbed" /&gt; Keith noted that architecture as a profession "hasn't (yet) experienced its Weinstein moment", referring to the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations]] and the resulting "[[Weinstein effect]]" of reporting sexual misconduct committed by powerful men in media and other industries.&lt;ref name="Keith Curbed" /&gt; In a 2018 ''Curbed'' article, Hilary George-Parkin said: &lt;blockquote&gt;"While Hollywood, tech, sports, media, politics, the restaurant industry, and others are reeling from high-profile revelations and resignations, the design world has remained—with the notable exception of Daniela Soleri's account of sexual abuse by her father, architect Paolo Soleri—mostly undisturbed in the public realm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/2/28/17058496/architecture-sexual-harassment-me-too-policies-gender|title=How top architecture firms measure up in the #MeToo era|last=Hilary|first=George-Parkin|date=2018-02-28|website=[[Curbed]]|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Psychogenic disease''' (or '''psychogenic illness''') is a name given to physical illnesses that are believed to arise from emotional or mental stressors, or from psychological or psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lim|first1=E. C H|last2=Seet|first2=R. C S|title=What is the place for placebo in the management of psychogenic disease?|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=1 February 2007|volume=100|issue=2|pages=60–61|doi=10.1258/jrsm.100.2.60|pmid=17277261|pmc=1790983}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly applied to illnesses where a physical abnormality or other biomarker has not yet been identified. In the absence of such "biological" evidence of an underlying disease process, it is often assumed that the illness must have a psychological cause, even if the patient shows no indications of being under stress or of having a psychological or psychiatric disorder.

Examples of diseases that are believed by many to be psychogenic include [[psychogenic seizures]], [[psychogenic polydipsia]], [[psychogenic tremor]] and [[psychogenic pain]].

There are problems with the assumption that all medically unexplained illness must have a psychological cause. It always remains possible that genetic, biochemical, electrophysiological or other abnormalities may be present which we do not have the technology or background to identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|287464|Conversion Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sykes|first1=Richard|title=Medically Unexplained Symptoms and the Siren "Psychogenic Inference"|journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry, &amp; Psychology|date=2010|volume=17|issue=4|pages=289–299|doi=10.1353/ppp.2010.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term psychogenic disease is often used in a similar way to [[psychosomatic]] disease. However, the term "psychogenic" usually implies that psychological factors played a key causal role in the development of the illness. The term "psychosomatic" is often used in a broader way to describe illnesses with a known medical cause where psychological factors may nonetheless play a role (e.g., asthma can be exacerbated by anxiety).

[[File:Wpa-done.JPG|thumb|250px|right|A US government poster from 1940, summarizing the [[Works Progress Administration]]'s achievements.]]
'''Public works''' are a broad category of [[infrastructure]] projects, financed and constructed by the [[government]], for recreational, employment, and health and safety uses in the greater [[community]]. They include public buildings ([[City and town halls|municipal buildings]], [[school]]s, [[hospital]]s), [[transport infrastructure]] ([[road]]s, [[railroad]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[canal]]s, [[port]]s, [[airport]]s), [[public spaces]] ([[public square]]s, [[park]]s, [[beach]]es), public services ([[Water supply network|water supply]] and [[Water purification|treatment]], [[sewage treatment]], [[electrical grid]], [[dam]]s), and other, usually long-term, physical [[asset]]s and [[Building|facilities]]. Though often interchangeable with [[public infrastructure]] and [[public capital]], public works does not necessarily carry an economic component, thereby being a broader term.

Public works has been encouraged since antiquity. For example, the Roman emperor [[Nero]] encouraged the construction of various infrastructure projects during widespread [[deflation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thornton |first1=Mary Elizabeth Kelly |date=1971 |title=Nero's New Deal |url= |journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |volume=102 |page=629 |doi=10.2307/2935958 |jstor=2935958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview {{anchor|Overview}}==
Public works is a multi-dimensional concept in [[economics]] and [[politics]], touching on multiple arenas including: recreation (parks, beaches), aesthetics (trees, green space), economy (goods and people movement, energy), law (police and courts), and neighborhood (community centers, social services buildings). Essentially, it represents any [[construction|constructed]] object that augments a nation's physical infrastructure.

Municipal infrastructure, [[urban infrastructure]], and [[rural development]] usually represent the same concept but imply either large cities or [[developing nation]]s' concerns respectively.  The terms [[public infrastructure]] or [[critical infrastructure]] are at times used interchangeably. However, critical infrastructure includes public works (dams, waste water systems, bridges, etc.) as well as  facilities like hospitals, banks, and telecommunications systems and views them from a [[national security]] viewpoint and the impact on the community that the loss of such facilities would entail.

[[File:Public works in Reggio Emili, Italy.jpg|thumb|Public works in Reggio Emilia, Emilia-Romagna, Italy]]

Furthermore, the term public works has recently been expanded to include digital public infrastructure projects. The first (US) nationwide digital public works project is an effort to create an open source software platform for e-voting (created and managed by the Open Source Digital Voting Foundation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The TrustTheVote Project |url=http://www.trustthevote.org/background |date=15 May 2009 |publisher=[[OSET Institute]], Inc |location=Palo Alto, CA |accessdate=6 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312224013/http://www.trustthevote.org/background |archivedate=12 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting increased concern with [[sustainability]], [[urban ecology]] and [[quality of life]], efforts to move towards [[sustainable municipal infrastructure]] are common in [[developed nation]]s, especially in [[European Union]] and [[Canada]] (where the [[FCM InfraGuide]] provides an officially mandated [[best practice exchange]] to move municipalities in this direction).

== Public works programmes ==
A public employment programme (PEP)' or 'public works programme (PWP)' is the provision of employment by the creation of predominantly [[public goods]] at a prescribed wage for those unable to find alternative employment. This functions as a form of [[social safety net]]. PWPs are activities which entail the payment of a wage (in cash or in kind) by the state, or by an Agent (or cash-for work/CFW). One particular form of public works, that of offering a short-term period of employment, has come to dominate practice, particularly in regions such as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Applied in the short term, this is appropriate as a response to transient shocks and acute labour market crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2608&amp;title=typology-public-works-programming |title=A typology for Public Works Programming |date=December 2008 |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430171423/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2608&amp;title=typology-public-works-programming |archivedate=30 April 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investing in public works projects in order to stimulate the general economy has been a popular policy measure since the economic crisis of the 1930s. More recent examples are the 2008-2009 [[Chinese economic stimulus program]], the [[2008 European Union stimulus plan]], and the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].

== Utility of investment ==
While it is argued that capital investment in public works can be used to reduce unemployment, opponents of internal improvement programs argue that such projects should be undertaken by the [[private sector]], and not the [[public sector]], because public works projects are characteristic of [[socialism]]. However, in the private sector, entrepreneurs bear their own losses and so private sector firms are generally unwilling to undertake projects that could result in losses or would not develop a revenue stream. Governments will invest in public works because of the overall benefit to society when there is a lack of private sector benefit (a project that will not generate revenue) or the risk is too great for a private company to accept on its own.

According to research conducted at the [[Aalborg University]], 86% of public works projects end up with cost overruns. Some unexpected findings of the research were that:
* Technically difficult projects were not more likely to exceed the budget than less difficult projects
* Projects in which more people were directly and indirectly affected by the project turned out to be more susceptible to cost overruns
* Project managers generally did not learn from similar projects attempted in the past&lt;ref&gt;Natuurwetenschap &amp; Techniek Magazine April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.home.nl/menno.visser/japaflyvbjerg.pdf Project peculiars] {{Dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally contracts awarded by public tenders will include a provision for unexpected expenses (i.e. cost overruns), that typically amount to 10% of the value of the contract.  This money is only spent during the course of the project if the construction managers judge that it is necessary, and typically the expenditure must be justified in writing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2399">A '''Regional Planning Organization''' is a government body that guides the development of public and private resources in a manner that ensures public safety, well being and livability. Regional planning organizations take different forms and may also include a metropolitan planning organization or may be part of a multi-state or multi-government association. A regional planning organization develops plans that coordinate planning by groups of local governments and special districts that have common social, political, economic, cultural or other similarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing Smart Legislative Guidebook: Chapter 6 Regional Planning|url=https://www.planning.org/growingsmart/guidebook/six01.htm|website=American Planning Association|publisher=American Planning Association Press|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally this process takes the form of [[urban planning]] or one of its sub-disciplines such as [[land use planning]], [[transportation planning]], or [[environmental planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Role of Regional Planning Organizations in Transportation Planning Across Boundaries|url=https://ntl.bts.gov/lib/52000/52100/52163/RPOsMegaregions.pdf|website=United States Department of Transportation|publisher=United States Department of Transportation Volpe Research Cente|accessdate=22 December 2017|page=1-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional planning organizations exist in a variety of different formats. In some areas they are a part of another organizations such as a Regional Council of Governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Council of Governments|url=http://www.rivercog.org/cog.html|website=River Council of Governments, Connecticut|publisher=River Council of Governments, Connecticut|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Councils, COGs &amp; MPOs|url=http://narc.org/about-narc/cogs-mpos/|website=About NARC|publisher=National Association of Regional Councils}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Regional planning organizations are sometimes also called regional development organisations as the need for planning often includes key economic development issues.

'''Śārṅgadeva''' (1175–1247) ({{lang-hi|शार्ङ्गदेव}}), &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ananda Lal|title=Theatres of India: A Concise Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goELAQAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-569917-3|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; also spelled '''Sharngadeva''' or '''Sarnga Deva''', was the 13th-century [[India]]n [[musicologist]] who authored ''[[Sangita Ratnakara]]'' – the classical Sanskrit text on music and drama.&lt;ref name="Lal1992p3987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohan Lal|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Sasay to Zorgot |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnPoYxrRfc0C&amp;pg=PA3987 |year=1992|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1221-3|page=3987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be the authoritative treatise in [[Indian classical music]] by both the [[Hindustani music]] and the [[Carnatic music]] traditions.&lt;ref name=bod116&gt;{{cite book|author=Rens Bod|title=A New History of the Humanities: The Search for Principles and Patterns from Antiquity to the Present|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=321oAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116| year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-164294-4|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MasseyMassey1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reginald Massey|author2=Jamila Massey|title=The Music Of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yySNDP9XVggC&amp;pg=PA42|accessdate=23 July 2013|year= 1996|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-332-8|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Śārṅgadeva was born in a [[Brahmin]] family of [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref name=massey41/&gt; In an era of Islamic invasion of the northwest regions of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the start of [[Delhi Sultanate]], his family migrated south and settled in the Hindu kingdom in the Deccan region ruled by the Yadava dynasty near [[Ellora Caves]] (Maharashtra). Sarangadeva worked as an accountant with freedom to pursue his music interests in the court of King [[Seuna_Yadavas_of_Devagiri#Singhana_II|Singhana II]] (1210–1247).&lt;ref name=massey41&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reginald Massey|author2=Jamila Massey|title=The Music Of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yySNDP9XVggC&amp;pg=PA41|year=1996|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-332-8|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramanlal Chhotalal Mehta, ''Musical Musings: Selected Essays'', Indian Musicological Society (1996), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T.

==Ideas==
Śārṅgadeva presented his ideas on music and dance in seven chapters of ''Sangita Ratnakara'', but integrated it with philosophical context.&lt;ref name="Lal1992p3987"/&gt; He systematically presented his ideas on the nature of sound, register, the smallest distinct sounds that humans can hear and musical instruments can produce (''[[Shruti (music)|shruti]]''), musical scales and modes, 264 ''[[raga]]s'', beats and role of time (''[[tala (music)|tala]]''), prosody (''[[Chanda]]s''), relation between performance arts and human emotions and sentiments, musical and vocal ornaments, the composition of drama and songs, and the limitless opportunities available to the artist to express and affect her audience.&lt;ref name="Lal1992p3987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lewis Rowell|title=Music and Musical Thought in Early India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_UCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-73034-9|pages=13, 212–214, 284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Peter G. Fletcher|Peter Fletcher]] – a professor of Music and Drama, Śārṅgadeva states in ''Sangita Ratnakara'' that "the composer was expected to be a competent performer, but he also made clear that the composer was expected to know his audience, and how their minds work, rising above his own likes and dislikes, in order to bring delight to everyone".&lt;ref name=fletcher253&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Fletcher|title=World Musics in Context: A Comprehensive Survey of the World's Major Musical Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vBEfViLyp8C&amp;pg=PA253 |year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-816636-8|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarangadeva's views on music, states Fletcher, exemplified ideas in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' relating to non-attachment.&lt;ref name=fletcher253/&gt;

==Influence==
Śārṅgadeva is one of the most influential medieval era music theorists of the Indian subcontinent, and his book has been called "the first modern book on Indian classical music".&lt;ref name="MasseyMassey1996"/&gt; The book is considered by some to be as significant as [[Bharata Muni|Bharata]]'s ''[[Natya Shastra]]''.

{{citation style|date=April 2012}}
In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], a '''schema''' (plural ''schemata'' or ''schemas'') describes a pattern of thought or behavior that organizes categories of information and the relationships among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DiMaggio | first1 = P | year = 1997 | title = Culture and cognition | url = | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 263–287 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.23.1.263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be described as a mental structure of preconceived ideas, a framework representing some aspect of the world, or a system of organizing and perceiving new information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www.psyctherapy.com/Enrolled/glossaryBody1.htm|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schemata influence attention and the absorption of new knowledge: people are more likely to notice things that fit into their schema, while re-interpreting contradictions to the schema as exceptions or distorting them to fit. Schemata have a tendency to remain unchanged, even in the face of contradictory information. Schemata can help in understanding the world and the rapidly changing environment.&lt;ref name="Nadkarni" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadkarni | first1 = S. | last2 = Narayanan | first2 = V. K. | year = 2007 | title = Strategic schemas, strategic flexibility, and firm performance: The moderating role of industry clockspeed | url = | journal = Strategic Management Journal | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 243–270 | doi = 10.1002/smj.576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People can organize new perceptions into schemata quickly as most situations do not require complex thought when using schema, since automatic thought is all that is required.&lt;ref name="Nadkarni" /&gt;

People use schemata to organize current knowledge and provide a framework for future understanding. Examples of schemata include [[Rubric (academic)|academic rubrics]], [[Social cognition#Social schemas|social schemas]], stereotypes, [[social role]]s, [[Behavioral script|scripts]], [[worldview]]s, and [[archetype]]s. In [[Piaget's theory]] of development, children construct a series of schemata, based on the interactions they experience, to help them understand the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Georgeon | first1 = O.R. | last2 = Ritter | first2 = F.E. | year = 2011 | title = An intrinsically motivated schema mechanism to model and simulate emergent cognition | doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2011.07.003 | journal = Cognitive Systems Research | volume = 15–16 | issue = | page = 75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before psychology separated from philosophy, the term "schema" was prominently discussed in philosophy by [[Schema (Kant)|Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nevid | first1 = J. S. | year = 2007 | title = Kant, cognitive psychotherapy, and the hardening of the categories | url = | journal = Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice | volume = 80 | issue = 4| pages = 605–615 | doi = 10.1348/147608307X204189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early developments of the idea in psychology emerged with the [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt psychologists]] and [[Jean Piaget]]: the term "schema" was introduced by Piaget in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1923). {{cite web|url=http://www.fondationjeanpiaget.ch/fjp/site/textes/VE/JP23_Langag_pensee_chap1_fonctionslang.pdf|title=Langage et pensée chez l'enfant}} (3e éd. 1948 revue et avec un nouvel avant-propos et un nouveau chapitre II inséré  utgave  bind). Neuchâtel: Delachaux et Niestlé, p. 43f.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was popularized in psychology and education through the work of the British psychologist [[Frederic Bartlett]],&lt;ref name="bartlett"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bartlett |first=F.C. |year=1932 |title=Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/727e/7f158dc0839ef789e3cb99f3fc3f2e38e017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; who drew on the term [[body schema]] used by neurologist [[Henry Head]]. It was expanded into schema theory by educational psychologist Richard C. Anderson.&lt;ref name=lingualinks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/ImplementALiteracyProgram/SchemaTheoryOfLearning.htm|title=Schema theory of learning|work=LinguaLinks Library|publisher=SIL International|date=2 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, other terms have been used to describe schema such as "frame", "scene" and "script".

==Schematic processing==
Through the use of schemata, a [[heuristic]] technique to encode and retrieve memories, the majority of typical situations do not require much strenuous processing. People can quickly organize new perceptions into schemata and act without effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kleider | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Pezdek | first2 = K. | last3 = Goldinger | first3 = S. D. | last4 = Kirk | first4 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Schema-driven source misattribution errors: Remembering the expected from a witnessed event | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 1–20 | doi = 10.1002/acp.1361 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, schemata can influence and hamper the uptake of new information ([[proactive interference]]), such as when existing [[stereotype]]s, giving rise to limited or [[bias]]ed discourses and expectations ([[prejudice]]s), lead an individual to "see" or "remember" something that has not happened because it is more believable in terms of his/her schema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tuckey | first1 = M. | last2 = Brewer | first2 = N. | year = 2003 | title = The influence of schemas, stimulus ambiguity, and interview schedule on eyewitness memory over time | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 101–118 | doi = 10.1037/1076-898X.9.2.101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a well-dressed businessman draws a knife on a vagrant, the schemata of onlookers may (and often do) lead them to "remember" the vagrant pulling the knife. Such distortion of memory has been demonstrated. (See {{section link||Background research}} below.)

Schemata are interrelated and multiple conflicting schemata can be applied to the same information. Schemata are generally thought to have a level of activation, which can spread among related schemata. Which schema is selected can depend on factors such as current activation, accessibility, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] and emotion.

''Accessibility'' is how easily a schema comes to mind, and is determined by personal experience and expertise. This can be used as a cognitive shortcut; it allows the [[availability heuristic|most common explanation to be chosen for new information]].

With priming, a brief imperceptible stimulus temporarily provides enough activation to a schema so that it is used for subsequent ambiguous information. Although this may suggest the possibility of [[subliminal message]]s, the effect of priming is so fleeting that it is difficult to detect outside laboratory conditions. Furthermore, the [[mere exposure effect]]—which requires consciousness of the stimuli—is far more effective than priming.

==Background research==
The original concept of schemata is linked with that of reconstructive memory as proposed and demonstrated in a series of experiments by Bartlett.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;Bartlett, F.C. (1932). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/727e/7f158dc0839ef789e3cb99f3fc3f2e38e017.pdf Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology]. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; By presenting participants with information that was unfamiliar to their cultural backgrounds and expectations and then monitoring how they recalled these different items of information (stories, etc.), Bartlett was able to establish that individuals' existing schemata and stereotypes influence not only how they interpret "schema-foreign" new information but also how they recall the information over time. One of his most famous investigations involved asking participants to read a Native American folk tale, "The War of the Ghosts", and recall it several times up to a year later. All the participants transformed the details of the story in such a way that it reflected their cultural norms and expectations, i.e. in line with their schemata. The factors that influenced their recall were:
* Omission of information that was considered irrelevant to a participant;
* Transformation of some of the details, or of the order in which events, etc., were recalled; a shift of focus and emphasis in terms of what was considered the most important aspects of the tale;
* Rationalization: details and aspects of the tale that would not make sense would be "padded out" and explained in an attempt to render them comprehensible to the individual in question;
* Cultural shifts: the content and the style of the story were altered in order to appear more coherent and appropriate in terms of the cultural background of the participant.

Bartlett's work was crucially important in demonstrating that long-term memories are neither fixed nor immutable but are constantly being adjusted as schemata evolve with experience. In a sense it supports the [[existentialism|existentialist]] view that people construct the past and present in a constant process of narrative/discursive adjustment, and that much of what people "remember" is actually confabulated (adjusted and rationalized) narrative that allows them to think of the past as a continuous and coherent string of events, even though it is probable that large sections of memory (both episodic and semantic) are irretrievable at any given time.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;

An important step in the development of schema theory was taken by the work of D.E. Rumelhart describing the understanding of narrative and stories.&lt;ref&gt;Rumelhart, D.E. (1980) [https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351607247/chapters/10.4324%2F9781315107493-4 Schemata: the building blocks of cognition]. In: R.J. Spiro et al. (Eds) Theoretical Issues in Reading Comprehension, Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. See also: Mandler, J. M. (1984). Stories, scripts, and scenes: Aspects of schema theory. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Further work on the concept of schemata was conducted by W.F. Brewer and J.C. Treyens, who demonstrated that the schema-driven expectation of the presence of an object was sometimes sufficient to trigger its erroneous recollection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = W. F. | last2 = Treyens | first2 = J. C. | title = Role of schemata in memory for places | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages= 207–230 | year = 1981 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(81)90008-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An experiment was conducted where participants were requested to wait in a room identified as an academic's study and were later asked about the room's contents. A number of the participants recalled having seen books in the study whereas none were present. Brewer and Treyens concluded that the participants' expectations that books are present in academics' studies were enough to prevent their accurate recollection of the scenes.

In the 1970s, computer scientist [[Marvin Minsky]] was trying to develop machines that would have human-like abilities. When he was trying to create solutions for some of the difficulties he encountered he came across Bartlett's work and decided that if he was ever going to get machines to act like humans he needed them to use their stored knowledge to carry out processes. To compensate for that he created what was known as the frame construct, which was a way to represent knowledge in machines. His frame construct can be seen as an extension and elaboration of the schema construct. He created the frame knowledge concept as a way to interact with new information. He proposed that fixed and broad information would be represented as the frame, but it would also be composed of slots that would accept a range of values; but if the world didn't have a value for a slot, then it would be filled by a default value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minsky|first=Marvin|title=A Framework for Representing Knowledge|year=1975|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|edition=The Psychology of Computer Vision|editor=Patrick H. Winston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Minsky's work, computers now have a stronger impact on psychology. In the 1980s, [[David Rumelhart]] extended Minsky's ideas, creating an explicitly psychological theory of the [[mental representation]] of complex knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rumelhart|first=David E.|title=Schemata: The Building Blocks of Cognition|year=1980|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|edition=Theoretical Issues in Reading Comprehension|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351607247/chapters/10.4324%2F9781315107493-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Schank and Robert Abelson developed the idea of a script, which was known as a generic knowledge of sequences of actions. This led to many new empirical studies, which found that providing relevant schema can help improve comprehension and recall on passages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schank|first1=Rodger C.|title=Scripts, Plans, Goals and Understanding|year=1977|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|last2=Abelson|first2=Robert P.|url=https://content.taylorfrancis.com/books/download?dac=C2007-0-06021-9&amp;isbn=9781134919666&amp;format=googlePreviewPdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modification==
New information that falls within an individual's schema is easily remembered and incorporated into their [[worldview]]. However, when new information is perceived that does not fit a schema, many things can happen. The most common reaction is to simply ignore or quickly forget the new information.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.

Zanna (Eds.), Social cognition: The Ontario Symposium on Personality and Social Psychology (pp. 89-134). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; This can happen on a deep level— frequently an individual does not become conscious of or even perceive the new information. People may also interpret the new information in a way that minimizes how much they must change their schemata. For example, Bob thinks that chickens don't lay eggs. He then sees a chicken laying an egg. Instead of changing the part of his schema that says "chickens don't lay eggs", he is likely to adopt the belief that the animal in question that he has just seen laying an egg is not a real chicken. This is an example of [[disconfirmation bias]], the tendency to set higher standards for evidence that contradicts one's expectations.&lt;ref name="taberandlodge"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taber | first1 = Charles S. | last2 = Lodge | first2 = Milton | title = Motivated Skepticism in the Evaluation of Political Beliefs | journal = American Journal of Political Science | publisher = Midwest Political Science Association | volume = 50 | number = 3 | pages= 755–769 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x | issn = 0092-5853}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the new information cannot be ignored, existing schemata must be changed or new schemata must be created (accommodation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Sullivan | first1 = Chris S. | last2 = Durso | first2 = Francis T. | year = 1984 | title = Effect of schema-incongruent information on memory for stereotypical attributes | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 1| pages = 55–70 | pmid = 6747816 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.1.55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Piaget]] (1896–1980) was known best for his work with development of human knowledge. He believed knowledge was constructed on cognitive structures, and he believed people develop cognitive structures by accommodating and assimilating information. Accommodation is creating new schema that will fit better with the new environment or adjusting old schema. Accommodation could also be interpreted as putting restrictions on a current schema. Accommodation usually comes about when assimilation has failed. Assimilation is when people use a current schema to understand the world around them. Piaget thought that schemata are applied to everyday life and therefore people accommodate and assimilate information naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Piaget|first=Jean|title=Studies in Reflection Abstraction|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|location=Sussex|isbn=1-84169-157-7|editor=Robert L. Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if this chicken has red feathers, Bob can form a new schemata that says "chickens with red feathers can lay eggs". This schemata will then be either changed or removed, in the future.

[[Assimilation (psychology)|Assimilation]] is the reuse of schemata to fit the new information. An example would be, when an unfamiliar dog is seen, a person will probably just integrate it into their dog schema. However, if the dog behaves strangely, and in ways that doesn't seem dog-like, there will be [[Accommodation (psychology)|accommodation]] as a new schema is formed for that particular dog. With Accommodation and Assimilation comes the idea of equilibrium. Piaget describes equilibrium as a state of cognition that is balanced when schema are capable of explaining what it sees and perceives. When information is new and cannot fit into existing schema this is called disequilibrium and this is an unpleasant state for the child's development. When disequilibrium happens, it means the person is frustrated and will try to restore the coherence of his or her cognitive structures through accommodation. If the new information is taken then assimilation of the new information will proceed until they find that they must make a new adjustment to it later down the road, but for now the child remains at equilibrium again. The process of equilibration is when people move from the equilibrium phase to the disequilibrium phase and back into equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLeod|first=S.

==Self-schema==
{{Main|Self-schema}}
Schemata about oneself are considered to be grounded in the present and based on past experiences. Memories are framed in the light of one's self-conception. For example, people who have positive self-schemata (i.e. most people) selectively attend to flattering information and selectively ignore unflattering information, with the consequence that flattering information is subject to deeper encoding, and therefore superior recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sedikides | first1 = C. | last2 = Green | first2 = J. D. | year = 2000 | title = On the self-protective nature of inconsistency/negativity management: Using the person memory paradigm to examine self-referent memory | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 906–92 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.906 | pmid=11138760}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when encoding is equally strong for positive and negative feedback, positive feedback is more likely to be recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sanitioso | first1 = R. | last2 = Kunda | first2 = Z. | last3 = Fong | first3 = G. T. | year = 1990 | title = Motivated recruitment of autobiographical memories | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 229–41 | pmid = 2213492 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, memories may even be distorted to become more favorable, for example, people typically remember exam grades as having been better than they actually were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bahrick | first1 = Harry P | last2 = Hall | first2 = Lynda K | last3 = Berger | first3 = Stephanie A | year = 1996 | title = Accuracy and Distortion in Memory for High School Grades | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 7 | issue = 5| pages = 265–271 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00372.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when people have negative self views, memories are generally biased in ways that validate the negative self-schema; people with low self-esteem, for instance, are prone to remember more negative information about themselves than positive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Story | first1 = A. L. | year = 1998 | title = Self-esteem and memory for favorable and unfavorable personality feedback | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 51–64 | doi=10.1177/0146167298241004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, memory tends to be biased in a way that validates the agent's pre-existing self-schema.

There are three major implications of self-schemata. First, information about oneself is processed faster and more efficiently, especially consistent information. Second, one retrieves and remembers information that is relevant to one's self-schema. Third, one will tend to resist information in the environment that is contradictory to one's self-schema. For instance, students with a particular self-schema prefer roommates whose view of them is consistent with that schema. Students who end up with roommates whose view of them is inconsistent with their self-schema are more likely to try to find a new roommate, even if this view is positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swann | first1 = W. B. | last2 = Jr | first2 =  | last3 = Pelham | first3 = B. W. | year = 2002 | title = Who wants out when the going gets good? Psychological investment and preference for self-verifying college roommates | url = | journal = Journal of Self and Identity | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 219–233 | doi=10.1080/152988602760124856}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of self-verification.

As researched by [[Aaron T. Beck|Aaron Beck]], automatically-activated negative self-schemata are a large contributor to depression. According to Cox, [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012), these self-schemata are essentially the same type of cognitive structure as stereotypes studied by prejudice researchers (e.g., they are both well-rehearsed, automatically activated, difficult to change, influential toward behavior, emotions, and judgments, and bias information processing).&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Cox |first1= William T. L. |last2= Abramson |first2= Lyn Y. |last3= Devine |first3= Patricia G. |last4= Hollon |first4= Steven D. |year= 2012 |title= Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective |journal= [[Perspectives on Psychological Science]] |volume= 7 |issue= 5 |pages= 427–449 |publisher= |doi= 10.1177/1745691612455204 |url= http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/5/427.abstract |accessdate= |pmid=26168502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-schema can also be self-perpetuating. It can represent a particular role in society that is based on stereotype, for example: "If a mother tells her daughter she looks like a tom boy, her daughter may react by choosing activities that she imagines a tom boy would do. Conversely, if the mother tells her she looks like a princess, her daughter might choose activities thought to be more feminine." This is an example of the self-schema becoming self-perpetuating when the person at hand chooses an activity that was based on an expectation rather than their desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology Glossary|url=http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Self-Schema|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schema therapy==
{{Main article|Schema therapy|List of maladaptive schemas}}
Schema therapy was founded by [[Jeffrey Young]] and represents a development of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) specifically for treating [[personality disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, J. E. (1999) Cognitive therapy for personality disorders: A schema-focused approach. (rev ed.) Sarasota, FL: Professional Resources Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="young"&gt;Young, Klosko &amp; Weishaar (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vScjGGgJEZgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Schema Therapy: A Practitioner's Guide]. New York: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Early maladaptive schemata'' are described by Young as broad and pervasive themes or patterns made up of memories, feelings, sensations, and thoughts regarding oneself and one's relationships with others. They are considered to develop during childhood or adolescence, and to be dysfunctional in that they lead to self-defeating behavior. Examples include schemata of abandonment/instability, mistrust/abuse, emotional deprivation, and defectiveness/shame.&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;

Schema therapy blends CBT with elements of [[Gestalt therapy]], [[object relations]], [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]] and [[psychoanalytic]] therapies in order to treat the characterological difficulties which both constitute personality disorders and which underlie many of the chronic depressive or anxiety-involving symptoms which present in the clinic. Young said that CBT may be an effective treatment for presenting symptoms, but without the conceptual or clinical resources for tackling the underlying structures (maladaptive schemata) which consistently organize the patient's experience, the patient is likely to lapse back into unhelpful modes of relating to others and attempting to meet their needs. Young focused on pulling from different therapies equally when developing schema therapy. The difference between cognitive behavioral therapy and schema therapy is the latter "emphasizes lifelong patterns, affective change techniques, and the therapeutic relationship, with special emphasis on [[Schema therapy#Limited reparenting|limited reparenting]]".&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Jeffery|title=Schema Therapy|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/videos/4310804.aspx|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recommended this therapy would be ideal for clients with difficult and chronic psychological disorders. Some examples would be [[eating disorder]]s and personality disorders. He has also had success with this therapy in relation to depression and substance abuse.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

A '''segue''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-segue.ogg|ˈ|s|ɛ|ɡ|w|eɪ}} ({{IPA-it|ˈseːɡwe}}) is a smooth transition from one topic or section to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is derived from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''segue'', "follows".

==In music==
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}
In [[music]], ''segue'' is a direction to the performer. It means ''continue (the next section) without a pause''. The term [[attacca]] is used synonymously.

For written music it implies a transition from one [[section (music)|section]] to the next without any break. In [[Musical improvisation|improvisation]], it is often used for transitions created as a part of the performance, leading from one section to another.

In live performance, a segue can occur during a [[jam session]], where the improvisation of the end of one song progresses into a new song. Segues can even occur between groups of musicians during live performance. For example, as one band finishes its set, members of the following act replace members of the first band one by one, until a complete band swap occurs.

In recorded music, a segue is a seamless transition between one song and another. The effect is often achieved through [[beatmatching]], especially on [[dance (music)|dance]] and [[disco]] recordings, or through arrangements that create the effect of a musical [[suite (music)|suite]], a classical style also used in many [[progressive rock]] recordings. The songs may further contain a lyrical connection or overall theme as well. With breakless joins of the elements in his albums [[Frank Zappa]] made extensive use of the segue technique.&lt;ref name="zappa"&gt;{{cite book |title=Frank Zappa FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the Father of Invention |first1=John |last1=Corcelli |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-61713-673-3 |page=290 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8e7aDgAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=8e7aDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT209 Extract of page 290]&lt;/ref&gt; This was first used in 1966 on Zappa's ''[[Freak Out!]]'', and a year later on the [[Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.&lt;ref name="zappa" /&gt;

In some Brazilian musical styles, where it is called "emendar" ("to splice"), in particular in [[Samba]] and [[Forró]] Pé de Serra, it is very commonly used in live performances, creating sets that usually last around 20 minutes but can sometimes take more than an hour, switching seamlessly between different songs.   The larger rhythm groups of bands, with up to ten percussionists in Samba for example, facilitate the switching of one song to another, as the percussionists keep the rhythm or beat going while the pitch instruments prepare the harmonical transition to the next song, often with just one pitch instrument leading this transition.   In [[Forró]] trios, where the only pitch instrument (apart from the voice) is the accordion (which plays together with two percussionists), the accordionist usually "puxa" ("pulls") the next song as soon as the previous has finished.

Some album notations distinguish track listings through the use of symbols, such as a &gt;, →, or / to indicate songs that flow seamlessly. The alternative rock band [[Failure (band)|Failure]] separates these musical transitions into individual tracks, which are simply given numerical distinctions such as ''Segue 1''. This system began with their 1996 album ''[[Fantastic Planet (album)|Fantastic Planet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.readjunk.com/reviews/albumreviews/failure-in-the-future/&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film or broadcast news production==

In audio/visual media, a segue is smooth transition from one scene or topic to another. A segue allows the director or show host to naturally proceed from one scene or topic to another without jarring the audience. A good segue makes the transition look natural and effortless.

'''Social media mining''' is the process of obtaining [[big data]] from user-generated content on social media sites and [[mobile apps]] in order to extract patterns, form conclusions about users, and act upon the information, often for the purpose of advertising to users or conducting research. The term is an analogy to the resource extraction process of [[mining]] for rare minerals. Resource extraction mining requires mining companies to sift through vast quantities of raw ore to find the precious minerals; likewise, social media mining requires human data analysts and automated software programs to sift through massive amounts of raw social media data in order to discern patterns and trends relating to social media usage, online behaviours, sharing of content, connections between individuals, online buying behaviour, and more. These patterns and trends are of interest to companies, governments and not-for-profit organizations, as these organizations can use these patterns and trends to design their strategies or introduce new programs, new products, processes or services.

Social media mining uses a range of basic concepts from [[computer science]], [[data mining]], [[machine learning]] and [[statistics]]. Social media miners develop [[algorithm]]s suitable for investigating massive files of social media data. Social media mining is based on theories and methodologies from  [[social network analysis]], [[network science]], [[sociology]], [[ethnography]], optimization and mathematics. It encompasses the tools to formally represent, measure and model meaningful patterns from large-scale social media data.&lt;ref name="Zafarani"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zafarani |first1=Reza |last2=Abbasi |first2=Mohammad Ali |last3=Liu |first3=Huan |title=Social Media Mining: An Introduction |year=2014 |url=http://dmml.asu.edu/smm |accessdate = 15 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, major corporations, governments and not-for-profit organizations engaged in social media mining to obtain data about customers, clients and citizens.

==Background==

As defined by Kaplan and Haenlein,&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Andreas M. |last2=Haenlein |first2=Michael|title=Users of the world, unite! The challenges and opportunities of social media |year=2010 |journal = Business Horizons | volume = 53 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; social media is the "group of internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content." There are many categories of social media including, but not limited to, social networking (Facebook or LinkedIn), microblogging (Twitter), photo sharing (Flickr, Photobucket, or Picasa), news aggregation (Google reader, StumbleUpon, or Feedburner), video sharing (YouTube, MetaCafe), livecasting (Ustream or Twitch.tv), virtual worlds (Kaneva), social gaming (World of Warcraft), social search (Google, Bing, or Ask.com), and instant messaging (Google Talk, Skype, or Yahoo! messenger).

The first social media website was introduced by [[GeoCities]] in 1994. It enabled users to create their own homepages without having a sophisticated knowledge of [[HTML]] coding. The first social networking site, [[SixDegrees.com]], was introduced in 1997. Since then, many other social media sites have been introduced, each providing service to millions of people. These individuals form a virtual world in which individuals (social atoms), entities (content, sites, etc.) and interactions (between individuals, between entities, between individuals and entities) coexist. Social norms and human behavior govern this virtual world. By understanding these social norms and models of human behavior and combining them with the observations and measurements of this virtual world, one can systematically analyze and mine social media. Social media mining is the process of representing, analyzing, and extracting meaningful patterns from data in social media, resulting from social interactions. It is an interdisciplinary field encompassing techniques from computer science, data mining, machine learning, social network analysis, network science, sociology, ethnography, statistics, optimization, and mathematics. Social media mining faces grand challenges such as the big data paradox, obtaining sufficient samples, the noise removal fallacy, and evaluation dilemma.
Social media mining represents the virtual world of social media in a computable way, measures it, and designs models that can help us understand its interactions. In addition, social media mining provides necessary tools to mine this world for interesting patterns, analyze information diffusion, study influence and homophily, provide effective recommendations, and analyze novel social behavior in social media.

== Uses ==

Social media mining is used across several industries including business development, social science research, health services, and educational purposes.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"&gt;Zafarani, R., Ali Abbasi, M., Liu, H., (2014). Social Media Mining. Cambridge University Press. http://dmml.asu.edu/smm.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singh, A., (2017). "Mining of Social Media data of University students." ''Education and Information Technologies'', 22: 1515-1526.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the data received goes through [[social media analytics]], it can then be applied to these various fields. Often, companies use the patterns of connectivity that pervade social networks, such as assortativity—the social similarity between users that are induced by influence, homophily, and reciprocity and transitivity.&lt;ref name="Tang, J. 2016"&gt;Tang, J., Chang, Y., Aggarwal, C., Liu, H., (2016). "A Survey of Signed Network Mining in Social Media". ''ACM Computing Surveys'', 49: 3.&lt;/ref&gt; These forces are then measured via statistical analysis of the nodes and connections between these nodes.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/&gt; Social analytics also uses [[sentiment analysis]], because social media users often relay positive or negative sentiment in their posts.&lt;ref name="Adedoyin-Olowe, M. 2013"&gt;Adedoyin-Olowe, M., Gaber, M., &amp; Stahl, F., (2013). "A Survey of Data Mining Techniques for Social Media Analysis."&lt;/ref&gt; This provides important social information about users' emotions on specific topics.&lt;ref&gt;Laeeq, F., Nafis, T., &amp; Beg, M. (2017). "Sentimental Classification of Social Media using Dating Mining." ''International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science'', 8: 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

These three patterns have several uses beyond pure analysis. For example, influence can be used to determine the most influential user in a particular network.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/&gt; Companies would be interested in this information in order to decide who they may hire for [[influencer marketing]]. These influencers are determined by recognition, activity generation, and novelty—three requirements that can be measured through the data mined from these sites.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/&gt; Analysts also value measures of homophily: the tendency of two similar individuals to become friends.&lt;ref name="Tang, J. 2016"/&gt; Users have begun to rely on information of other users' opinions in order to understand diverse subject matter.&lt;ref name="Adedoyin-Olowe, M. 2013"/&gt; These analyses can also help create recommendations for individuals in a tailored capacity.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/&gt; By measuring influence and homophily, online and offline companies are able to suggest specific products for individuals consumers, and groups of consumers. Social media networks can use this information themselves to suggest to their users possible friends to add, pages to follow, and accounts to interact with.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="888">'''Splash zone''' applies either to the [[Supralittoral zone]] or, in the context of [[Offshore construction]], to the transition from air to water when lowering heavy burdens into the sea. The overall efforts applied on the [[Crane (machine)#Floating crane|crane]] change dramatically when the load starts touching water, up to the point where it is completely submerged. Its [[buoyancy]] reduces the static mass that the crane has to support, but contact with the waves creates widely fluctuating dynamic forces.

Simulation of these changing efforts are necessary to correctly dimension cranes and lifting equipments. See for example [https://exchange.dnv.com/publishing/Codes/download.asp?url=2012-12/rp-h103.pdf DNV-RP-H103] (Det Norske Veritas recommended practices) for a mention of the piston effect created in the splash zone between two walls.

# That condition of a [[system]] wherein its mandated operational and technical parameters are within the prescribed limits.  
# The quality of an [[Automated information system|AIS]] when it performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner, free from deliberate or inadvertent unauthorized manipulation of the system. 
# The state that exists when there is complete assurance that under all conditions an [[Information technology|IT]] system is based on the logical correctness and reliability of the [[operating system]], the logical completeness of the [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] that implement the protection mechanisms, and [[data integrity]].

==History==

The business was established in 2006 by Jeff Fairhall and Joe Whinney in the [[Fremont, Seattle|Fremont]] neighborhood of Seattle. The business is located in a [[Fremont Trolley Barn|former brewery building and trolleycar depot]] at 3400 Phinney Avenue.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Jeff Fairhall, the founder of Seattle's Essential Baking Company, invested in the establishment of Theo Chocolate with Joe Whinney.&lt;ref name=richman&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Jeff-Fairhall-1958-2007-Entrepreneur-pioneered-1250121.php |title=Jeff Fairhall, 1958-2007: Entrepreneur pioneered healthful food to go - seattlepi.com |first=Dan |last=Richman |work=seattlepi.com |date=19 September 2007 |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fairhallobit"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2003894838_fairhallobit21m.html |title=Local News &amp;#124; Jeff Fairhall, owner of Essential Baking Co., dies at 49 |first=Susan |last=Gilmore |work=seattletimes.com |date=September 21, 2007 |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was in his early 20s, Whinney volunteered with a small conservation foundation in Southern [[Belize]] that was looking at the way that communities cultivated their crops. He developed a passion for the [[Theobroma cacao]] plant and wanted to get into the business while supporting the farmers, and contacted 10 bean processors. One responded. While providing this business with organic materials and customers, Whinney was able to start saving up to found a chocolate business of his own.&lt;ref name=Fair/&gt;

The business struggled to find a good supply of organic cocoa beans and came to a halt in 2002. After finding an interested investor in [[Seattle, Washington]], the decision was made to build the Theo Chocolate factory, named after the Theobroma cacao tree.&lt;ref name= Fair /&gt;

From 2004 to 2006 Fairhall sold all of his other business interests, retaining only Theo Chocolate. He published more than 30 advertisements in ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'' about various religious ideas, revelations, and conspiracy theories. He also mentioned his use of [[Psilocybin mushroom|magic mushrooms]].&lt;ref name=richman/&gt; Fairhall died of brain cancer in 2007.&lt;ref name=richman/&gt;

In April 2018, Etienne Patout, a former Kellogg's executive, became the company's CEO.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.confectionerynews.com/Article/2018/04/13/Theo-Chocolate-names-former-Kellogg-exec-as-CEO&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8324">'''Thorson's rule''' (named after [[Gunnar Thorson]] by S. A. Mileikovsky in 1971)
&lt;ref name="Mileikovsky"&gt;Mileikovsky, S. A. 1971. ''Types of larval development in marine bottom invertebrates, their distribution and ecological significance: a reevaluation.'' Marine Biology 19: 193-213&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Biological rules|ecogeographical rule]] which states that [[benthic]] [[marine invertebrates]] at low latitudes tend to produce large numbers of eggs developing to [[pelagic]] (often planktotrophic &lt;nowiki&gt;[plankton-feeding]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) and widely dispersing larvae, whereas at high latitudes such organisms tend to produce fewer and larger lecithotrophic (yolk-feeding) eggs and larger offspring, often by [[viviparity]] or [[ovoviviparity]], which are often brooded.&lt;ref name="Thorson"&gt;Thorson, G. 1957 Bottom communities (sublittoral or shallow shelf). In "Treatise on Marine Ecology and Palaeoecology" (Ed J.W. Hedgpeth) pp. 461-534. Geological Society of America.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Groups involved ==
The rule was originally established for marine bottom invertebrates, but it also applies to a group of parasitic [[flatworms]], monogenean ectoparasites on the gills of marine fish.&lt;ref name="Rohde"&gt;Rohde, K. 1985. Increased viviparity of marine parasites at high latitudes. Hydrobiologia 127: 197-201.&lt;/ref&gt;
Most low-latitude species of [[Monogenea]] produce large numbers of [[ciliated]] [[larva]]e. However, at high latitudes, species of the entirely viviparous family Gyrodactylidae, which produce few nonciliated offspring and are very rare at low [[latitude]]s, represent the majority of gill [[Monogenea]], i.e., about 80–90% of all species at high northern latitudes, and about one third of all species in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters, against less than 1% in tropical waters. Data compiled by A.V. Gusev in 1978 indicates that Gyrodactylidae may also be more common in cold than tropical freshwater systems, suggesting that Thorson's rule may apply to freshwater invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Gusev"&gt;Gusev, A.V. 1978. Monogenoidea of freshwater fish. Principles of systematics, analysis of the world fauna and its evolution. Parasitologicheskij Sbornik 28: 96-198 (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are exceptions to the rule, such as ascoglossan [[snail]]s: tropical ascoglossans have a higher incidence of lecithotrophy and direct development than temperate species.&lt;ref name="Krug"&gt;Krug, P.J. 1998. Poecilogony in an estuarine opisthobranch: planktotrophy, lecithotrophy, and mixed clutches in a population of the ascoglossan Alderia modesta. Marine Biology 132:483-494.&lt;/ref&gt;
A study in 2001 indicated that two factors are important for Thorson's rule to be valid for marine gastropods: 1) the habitat must include rocky [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]]s, because soft-bottom habitats appear to favour non-pelagic development; and 2) a diverse assemblage of [[taxa]] need to be compared to avoid the problem of phyletic constraints, which could limit the evolution of different developmental modes.&lt;ref name="Gallardo"&gt;Gallardo, C.S. and Penchaszadeh, P.E. 2001. Hatching mode and latitude in marine gastropods: revisiting Thorson's paradigm in the southern hemisphere. Marine Biology 138 547-552&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application to deep-sea species ==

The [[temperature gradient]] from warm surface waters to the [[deep sea]] is similar to that along latitudinal gradients. A gradient as described by Thorson's rule may therefore be expected. However, evidence for such a gradient is ambiguous;&lt;ref name="Mileikovsky"/&gt; Gyrodactylidae have not yet been found in the deep sea.&lt;ref name="Rohde"/&gt;

== Explanations ==

Several explanations of the rule have been given. They include:
# Because of the reduced speed of development at low temperatures, most species cannot complete development during the short time of [[phytoplankton]] bloom, on which planktotrophic species depend;
# Most species cannot synchronize hatching with the phytoplankton bloom;
# Slower development increases the risk of predation on pelagic larvae;
# Non-pelagic larvae can settle close to the parent, i.e. in a favourable environment;
# Small pelagic larvae may have osmotic difficulties in Arctic and Antarctic summers, due to the melting ice;
# Small larvae may not be able to survive at very low temperatures;
# Cold temperature may select for large size at the beginning of development, resulting in non-pelagic larvae; and
# In cold waters it is more difficult to precipitate dissolved calcium, which results in reduced body size of animals supported by calcium skeletons, leading to viviparity.

Most of these explanations can be excluded for the Monogenea, whose larvae are never planktotrophic (therefore eliminating explanations 1 and 2), their larvae are always short-lived (3), Gyrodactylidae are most common not only close to melting ice but in cold seas generally (5). Explanation 6 is unlikely, because small organisms are common in cold seas, Gyrodactylidae are among the smallest Monogenea (7), and Monogenea do not possess calcareous skeletons (8). The conclusion is that the most likely explanation for the Monogenea (and by implication for other groups) is that small larvae cannot locate suitable habitats at low temperatures, where physiological including sensory processes are slowed down, and/or that low temperatures prevent the production of sufficient numbers of pelagic larvae, which would be necessary to find suitable habitats in the vast oceanic spaces.&lt;ref name="Rohde"/&gt;

== Implications for Rapoport's rule ==

[[Rapoport's rule]] states that latitudinal ranges of species are generally smaller at low than at high latitudes. Thorson's rule contradicts this rule, because species disperse more widely at low than at high latitudes, supplementing much evidence against the generality of Rapoport's rule and for the fact that tropical species often have wider geographical ranges than high latitude species.&lt;ref name="Rohde2"&gt;Rohde, K., Heap M. and Heap, D. 1993. Rapoport's rule does not apply to marine teleosts and cannot explain latitudinal gradients in species richness. American Naturalist 142: 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde3"&gt;Rohde, K. 1999. Latitudinal gradients in species diversity and Rapoport's rule revisited: a review of recent work, and what can parasites teach us about the causes of the gradients? Ecography 22: 593-613. Also published In ''Ecology 1999 - and tomorrow'' (Ed T Fenchel), pp. 73-93. (Ecology Institute: University of Lund, Sweden).

'''''Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva''''' (''All the Works of Architecture and Perspective'') is an [[architecture|architectural]] [[treatise]] by [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475-1554). Serlio is sometimes regarded as one of the most important. The treatise is composed of eight [[book]]s, the sixth of which was lost for some centuries and the eighth of which was not published until relatively recently. The eighth book is not always considered to be part of the treatise. The first five books cover Serlio's works on [[geometry]], [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] antiquity, the [[Classical order|Orders]] and [[Church (building)|church]] design. The sixth illustrates domestic designs ranging from [[peasant]] huts to royal palaces, providing a unique record of Renaissance house types, including up-to-date [[fortress]]es for [[tyrant]]s and mercenaries as well as Serlio's unbuilt design for the [[Louvre]]. The seventh book illustrates a range of common design problems ignored by past theorists, including how to remodel, or 'restore', [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[façade]]s following antique principles of [[symmetry]] and [[Proportion (architecture)|proportion]]. The eighth book, called "'''Castrametation of the Romans'''", reconstructs a Roman encampment after the description by [[Polybius]], followed by a military [[city]] and monumental [[bridge]] supposedly built by the Emperor [[Trajan]]. With its [[Forum (Roman)|forum]], [[consul]]'s palace and [[Roman baths|baths]], the book is part-fantasy and part-[[archaeology]], quite unlike Serlio's other more practical works.

'''Visual research''' is a qualitative research methodology that relies on the use of artistic mediums to "produce and represent knowledge." These artistic mediums include, but are not limited to: [[film]], [[photography]], [[drawing]]s, [[painting]]s, and [[sculptures]]. The artistic mediums provide a rich source of information that has the ability of capturing reality. They also reveal information about what the medium captures, but the artist or the creator behind the medium. Using photography as an example, the photographs taken illustrate reality and give information about the photographer through the angle, focus of the image, and the moment in which the photograph was taken.

==  Research process, a definition and visual images ==

Images are an essential component for different sorts on inquires in a wide range of topics and research questions may call for a visual component in a variety of ways. One way could be to the research questions or the phenomena being examined, or the researcher could be the one making new images. After the visual material is created the resulting collection may be the base of further discussion, interviews, and or analysis, although the process of creating images is often a large part of the research process itself.

== Participant generated visual methodologies ==

This method of data collection is often used to elicit data or opinion, here the participant is the one who would be generating the visual data. If it is a photograph she or he has taken  it, or for a video, she or he has shot the visual data that will be further analysed. This is important as it allows the researcher to understand participants' views and perceptions.
 definition

=== Photovoice ===
Caroline C. Wang and Mary Anne Burris conceptualized the visual methodology called [[photovoice]].  Participants are provided with a camera and asked to produce an image-based account of their experiences and/or those things that are important to them in a particular context. These projects share the assumption that increased participant control of data generation through production of visual images will help to highlight important aspects of lived experience that might otherwise have been overlooked or ignored by researchers. This method is often used in social science and health research.

=== Fotohistorias ===
Ricardo Gomez and Sara Vannini (&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, Ricardo &amp; Vannini, Sara (2015). Fotohistorias: Participatory Photography and the Experience of Migration. CreateSpace, Bilingual: English &amp; Spanish&lt;/ref&gt;) introduced a variation of photovoice called Fotohistorias, that combines participant-generated photos and semistructured interviews to elicit lived experiences of immigrants and other marginalized communities. Fotohistorias combines the power of images and the richness of stories. Together, they yield more depth and sensitivity than either photos or interviews alone. Fotohistorias helps to quickly get to deep conversation about profound and meaningful topics, by focusing on the photos as a pretext for conversation. Fotohistorias helps elicit multiple perspectives and symbols from the same image or place, emphasizing how people’s perceptions and feelings shape meaning and experience. Fotohistorias participants frequently feel empowered, heard and valued, and gain a new perspective and agency over their current situation and context. &lt;ref&gt;www.fotohistorias.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photo-elicitation ===
The photo-elicitation approach can include researcher or participant generated photographs. Photographs are introduced to the context of research interview based off the "assumption about the role and utility of photographs in promoting reflections that words alone cannot." Participant generated photo elicitation puts significance to the participants role in shaping the creation of visual images. It is important to note the value of the technique for "bridging culturally distinct worlds of the researcher and the researched." The term photo-elicitation originated from a paper published by Collier (1957), when it was initiated as a solution to the practical difficulties that research teams were having in relation to agreeing on categories for quality housing. Collier extended the method to examine how families adapted to residence among ethnically different people, and to new forms of work in urban factories, interviewing families and communities with photographs created by researchers. Reflecting on the use of photo-elicitation, Collier (1957, p.&amp;nbsp;858), argued that ‘pictures elicited longer and more comprehensive interviews but at the same time helped subjects overcome the fatigue and repetition of conventional interviews’ and noted the technique’s ‘compelling effect upon the informant, its ability to prod latent memory, to stimulate and release emotional statements about the informant’s life’. Photo-elicitation with researcher-initiated productions has been taken up by a range of researchers across the social sciences and related disciplines (Mannay 2016)&lt;ref&gt;Mannay, D. 2016 Visual, Narrative and Creative Research Methods Application, reflection and ethics. Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film-elicitation ===

This technique of data collection is mostly used by researchers who believe in Positivist or realist view of the world.
Making a film as opposed to simply shooting footages, involves editing and other post production tasks, such as adding subtitles, but it also rests upon a series of ideas concerning the place of visual representation within social science itself. 
This technique of data collection or data analysis is not widely used because of its multiple requirements. 
Making films – to elicit data or opinion, can be of 3 basic types:
1.Documenting or filming the subjects
2.Showing a film to the subjects and asking about their opinion 
3.Asking the subjects to make a film

There are 3 basic concerns when it comes to analysis of a film or a video: 
1. the analytical approach taken towards film or video.
2. method employed to derive data.
3. the kind of issue being analysed.

=== Benefits and limitations ===

This methodology is beneficial in its applicability to participants who may be [[illiterate]] or have difficulty communicating because of [[language barrier]]s, lack of education, or a disability. This characteristic of Photovoice allows researchers who choose to use this methodology to choose participants from a large sample pool because there are no language or literacy requirements. Photovoice may be a powerful research tool because it allows the researcher to see the topic being studied from the participant's perspective. It also encourages the participants and the researcher to reflect on the images and meaning behind them as they highlight an aspect or perspective of the research topic perhaps not previously considered. In this way visual methods of data production can act as tools of defamilairisation, fighting familiarity for both researchers and participants and allowing space for a more nuanced understanding of the topics studies (Mannay 2010)&lt;ref&gt;Mannay, D. 2010. Making the familiar strange: Can visual research methods render the familiar setting more perceptible?. Qualitative Research 10(1), pp. 91-111&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The use of Photovoice also has its limits. It requires the researcher to budget for the equipment used to carry it out, such as cameras, ink and printing costs. This may be problematic for the researcher if the research has been given limited or insufficient funds.
 
Another problem that may arise in the use of Photovoice is the question of photograph ownership. The researcher may be providing the equipment, but it is the participants who are taking the pictures. To avoid any potential issues regarding photograph ownership, it is advised that researchers obtain from their participants permission to use the photographs they take. It is particularly important to think carefully about informed consent in an era of digital dissemination and open access publication where images can be reworked, redistributed and recirculated in the digital economy, in ways that may not have been envisaged at the time of the research study (Mannay, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Mannay, D. 2014. Story telling beyond the academy: exploring roles, responsibilities and regulations in the Open Access dissemination of research outputs and visual data. The Journal of Corporate Citizenship 54, pp. 109-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical warnings ==

=== Deception or manipulation ===

These are activities where the experimenters are either not disclosing their real identity, or their true purpose for the activity.  This includes assuming a [[pseudonym|false identity]] such as creating an avatar in an online game, or pretending to be a tourist while looking at statutes. This could also includes manipulating settings in order to observe reactions.

=== Observing and objectifying people by looking covertly from a distance ===

These activities concern individuals who feel that a particular population is being treated in a dispassionate manner or similar to scientists observing natural phenomena in a clinical way. Examples of this would be the exercises which you ask to observe the waiting behaviors of people in public places (either in person from a distance or via [[webcam]]).

=== Intimate or detailed observations of personal places or behavior ===

This category refers to a in-depth analysis of intimate, meaningful or personal places activities or spaces, and may include making judgments which could sadden or offend people. An example of this could be coding or commenting on gravestone trends or personal graffiti.

=== Possibility of causing discomfort or concern ===

This is a category, in which the exercise or project may upset some people, or create anxiety or fear (including and potentially, in the researcher). This may happen due to situations which could include wasting people's time or not conforming to societal norms, such as in 'breaching' experiments. The visual offers a range of exciting possibilities for social research but it also brings an array of challenges and ethical difficulties. Visual Ethics can now be regarded as a specialist area within visual methodologies. Much mainstream engagement with the ethics of visual ethnography focuses on issues of anonymity of place and participants so that the focus is on who is taking the picture, who is in the picture; and what else can be known from the geography or materiality of the image. Thus, the moral maze of image ethics has been centrally concerned with the creator of images in relation to informed consent and the tension between revealing and concealing the contents of visual images; and who has ‘the right’ to claim ownership of images to in turn edit their content and show them to others (Mannay 2016).Once a visual image is created it becomes very difficult to control its use or remove it from the public arena if participants decide that they no longer want to be represented in a fixed visual trope for time immemorial. Even if images are successfully anodised, acts to disguise images can be seen as tantamount to silencing the voice of research participants. This is particularly problematic where researchers invest in the epistemological aims of participatory approaches predicated on giving ‘voice’.

Women were professionally active in the academic discipline of [[art history]] already in the nineteenth century and participated in the important shift early in the century that began involving an "emphatically corporeal visual subject", with [[Vernon Lee]] as a notable example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Hilary|date=1998–1999|title=Women and the Ends of Art History: Vision and Corporeality in Nineteenth-Century Critical Discourse|journal=[[Victorian Studies]]|volume=42|issue=1|pages=77–100|jstor=3829127|doi=10.2979/vic.1998.42.1.77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that in the twentieth century women art historians (and curators), by choosing to study women artists, "dramatically" "increased their visibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tannenbaum|first=Judith|authorlink=Judith Tannenbaum|year=1994|title=East Coast- C Is for Contemporary Art Curator: Curiosity, Contradiction, Collaboration, Challenge|journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]|volume=53|issue=3|pages=47, 49, 51, 53 55, 57, 59|jstor=777431|doi=10.2307/777431}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, women art historians are one of two groups (besides authors of high-school texbooks) "who say there have been great women artists" in the first place, according to the authors of a study of the representations of women artists in US textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Roger|author2=Ashley Folgo |year=2006|title=Who Says There Have Been Great Women Artists? Some Afterthoughts|journal=[[Art Education (journal)|Art Education]]|volume=59|issue=2|pages=47–52|jstor=27696136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and employment==
&lt;!--Obviously this needs to be a historical narrative, not just a single note--but hey, that's all I got right now--&gt;In the United States professional, academic employment for women art historians was, by the early 1970s, not commensurate with the number of female PhDs in art history. Between 1960 and 1969, 30.1% of PhDs were awarded to women but those numbers increased significantly during that period: between 1960 and 1965 it was 27%, but between 1966 and 1967 it had gone up to 43.5%. But in 1970-1971, women art historians in art departments in the US made up 23.1% of instructors, 21.6% of assistant professors, 17.5% of associate professors, and only 11.1% of full professors. Comparison with the numbers for the same years for women in the languages, from a study done by the [[Modern Language Association]], showed that "women in C.A.A. [College Art Association] professions face[d] rather more severe discrimination than women in M.L.A. fields". Similar tendencies were reported for salary and employment in studio teaching ("preliminary statistics...indicate that women artists receive a disproportionately small share of full-time studio jobs") and in museums ("particularly significant was a tendency to hire women with BAs to be secretaries and men with BAs for trainee programs which rapidly advanced them to more challenging positions).&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

The history of women in the profession also suggests that art education itself has benefited from the increased presence of professional women art historians, since women students sometimes found it necessary to "redo" an education in which only a male point of view had been provided given. [[Paula Harper]], "one of the first art historians to bring a feminist perspective to the study of painting and sculpture",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/arts/design/paula-hays-harper-feminist-art-historian-dies-at-81.html?_r=0|title=Paula Hays Harper, Art Historian, Is Dead at 81|last=Grady|first=Denise|date=25 June 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Moira Roth shared the same experience of a "one-sided training", of feeling left out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harper|first=Paula|year=1985|title=The First Feminist Art Program: A View from the 1980s|journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]|volume=10|issue=4|pages=762–81|jstor=3174313|doi=10.1086/494182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination against "women in college and university art departments and art museums" was, in the early 1970s, the immediate cause for the foundation of the [[Women's Caucus for Art]] (see below).&lt;ref name=harris&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Ann Sutherland|year=1973|title=Women in College Art Departments and Museums|journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]|volume=32|issue=4|pages=417–19|jstor=775692|doi=10.2307/775692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statistical study of US employment among art faculties published in 1977, Sandra Packard notes that "in art departments women have been decreasing in number since the 1930's", and that the number of women in art faculties at institutes of higher education "decreas[ed] from 22% in 1963 to a low of 19.5% in 1974", and cites statistics suggesting that "although women are concentrated at the lower ranks in art faculties, they have more Ph.D. degrees than their male colleagues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Analysis of Current Statistics and Trends as They Influence the Status and Future for Women in the Art Academe|first=Sandra|last=Packard|journal=[[Studies in Art Education]]|volume=18|issue=2|year=1977|pages=38–48|jstor=1319477|doi=10.2307/1319477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation==
The [[Women's Caucus for Art]] (WCA), a caucus for woman art historians, artists, and curators was founded at the 1972 meeting of the [[College Art Association]] (CAA), but re-established itself as an independent organization in 1974 after the CAA told them they could not use the CAA name anymore. According to Judith Brodsky, the CAA was, at the time, very much a male-dominated organization; she notes, though, in a 1977 article that the Caucus is given space and time at the annual CAA conference and in the CAA's journal, ''Art Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brodsky|first=Judith K.|year=1977|title=The Women's Caucus for Art|journal=[[Women's Studies Newsletter]]|volume=5|issue=1/2|pages=13–15|jstor=40042430}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Women's Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]] was installed in 1979. The organization's objectives include "providing women with leadership opportunities and professional development" and "expanding networking and exhibition opportunities for women", and to that purpose publishes a newsletter, organizes sessions at conferences, and runs databases for "art and activism". In 2012 the WCA celebrated its 40th anniversary, and published a pamphlet for the annual awards ceremony that also includes a number of historical essays and reflections from the past presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalwca.org/LTA/LTA2012.pdf|accessdate=25 May 2014|publisher=Women's Caucus for Art|title=Women's Caucus for Art: 40th Anniversary Celebration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women art historians and feminist art theory==
Feminist scholars have argued that the role of women art historians is connected to the study of women (as artists and as subjects) by art historians.&lt;ref name=schleif/&gt; In 1974, Lise Vogel noted that there were few feminist art historians, and that women art historians in general seemed unwilling to ask "the more radical critiques" a feminist scholar should engage in.&lt;ref name="vogel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Lise|editor1-first=Arlene|editor1-last=Raven|editor2-first=Cassandra L.|editor2-last=Langer|editor3-first=Joanna|editor3-last=Frueh|title=Feminist Art Criticism: An Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GT9-qWARitsC&amp;pg=PA24|year=1991|publisher=IconEditions|isbn=9780064302166|pages=21–58|chapter=Fine Arts and Feminism: The Awakening Consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1998 essay, [[Corine Schleif]] argued that women and feminist scholars need to challenge the "Great Master" canon, and that they need to focus less on "style as evidence of authorship", seen as a traditionally masculine way of viewing the history of art, but rather on style as "one of many sites on the production of meaning". The topic of women scholars in art history is thus intricately connected with what scholars have called [[feminist art theory]];&lt;ref name=schleif&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUQF7T5nXBkC|title=Attending to Early Modern Women|editor1-first=Susan Dwyer|editor1-last=Amussen|editor2-first=Adele F.|editor2-last=Seeff|first=Corine |last=Schleif|chapter=The Role of Women in Challenging the Canon of 'Great Master' Art History|year=1998|publisher=U of Delaware P|isbn=9780874136500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry Freedman, for example, claims that "women art historians often interpret art that is about and by women differently than their male colleagues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freedman|first=Kerry|year=1994|title=About This Issue: The Social Reconstruction of Art Education|journal=[[Studies in Art Education]]|volume=35|issue=3|pages=131–34|jstor=1320214|doi=10.2307/1320214}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Carol Armstrong]] and [[Catherine de Zegher]], in ''Women artists at the millennium'' (2006), argue that by the 1980s many "women art history scholars" had begun to think of feminism as irrelevant to the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History|chapter=Art and Architecture: Art History|pages=142–43|last=Mathews|first=Patricia|editor1-first=Bonnie G.|editor1-last=Smith|year=2008|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=9780195148909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zemiology''' is the study of social harms. Zemiology gets its name from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ζημία ''zēmía'', meaning "[[harm]]".&lt;ref name="Hillyard, P. 2004"&gt;Hillyard, P. (with C. Pantazis, S. Tombs and D. Gordon) (2004) ''Beyond Criminology: Taking Harm Seriously'', London: Pluto Press&lt;/ref&gt;
It originated as a [[critique]] of [[criminology]] and the notion of [[crime]]. In contrast with "individual-based harms" such as [[theft]], the notion of social harm or social injury incorporates harms caused by [[nation state]]s and [[Corporation|corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwendinger, H. and Schwendinger, J. (1970) "Defenders of order or guardians of human rights" ''Issues in Criminology''&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have received increased attention from critical academics such as [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxists]] and [[Feminism|feminists]] who have sought to create an independent field of study, separate from criminology, that studies the harms that affect individuals' lives that are not considered to be criminal or are rarely [[Criminalization|criminalised]] such as [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] misselling, [[poverty]] and [[unemployment]].&lt;ref name="Hillyard, P. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Special Issue of Crime, Law and Social Change (2007, vol 48: 1-2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zemiological critique of criminology and crime==
Hillyard and Tombs outline a number of criticisms of criminology and crime:&lt;ref&gt;see chap 2 (2004) ''Beyond Criminology: Taking Harm Seriously'', Pluto Press&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Crime has no [[Ontology|ontological]] reality" – Crime is a [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]] and is based on social judgements. However, there are no central properties that pertain to the notion of crime; therefore, what is a crime will vary across time and space.
* "Criminology perpetuates the myth of crime" – Criminology is based upon the notion of crime, which fails to adequately address the social construction of the concept. Therefore, criminology's continued use of the notion within its frame of analysis perpetuates the myth that crimes are distinct acts that may be understood as separate social phenomena.
* "Crime consists of many petty events" – In a large proportion of reported crimes, the harms endured by victims, if there are any, are minimal.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2015}} Hence Hillyard and Tombs argue that "the definitions of crime in the [[criminal law]] do not reflect the only or the most dangerous of antisocial behaviours."
* "Crime excludes many serious harms" – Many events and incidents which cause serious harm are either not part of the criminal law or, if they could be dealt with by it, are either ignored or handled without resort to it. The undue attention given to events which are defined as crimes distracts attention from more serious harm (such as [[pollution]] or poverty).
* {{Double single}}Crime control' is ineffective" – Hillyard and Tombs have argued that the methods and approach to crime control have patently failed. They believe the criminal justice system is unsuccessful in fulfilling its aims and in reforming criminal offenders. It appears that the criminal justice system sees there is only one solution to crime control, and that is a [[prison]] [[Sentence (law)|sentence]]; however, it is questionable whether this actually resolves certain crimes in society.
* {{Double single}}Crime' gives legitimacy to the expansion of crime control" – Since the early 1990s, governments have emphasised crime control as a key concern, and crime control has increased faster than any other area of public expenditure.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Consequently, security firms have increasingly sought to provide services to the burgeoning penal state. It is argued that these private interests have played a key part in the expansion of prison, as means to deal with social problems.
* "Contrasting 'crimes{{Single double}} – The criminal law uses different tests to determine whether a crime has been committed. The principal test is the concept of ''[[mens rea]]'' – the guilty mind – which applies to the individual but not exclusively. However, these tests are not objective and often rely on subjective judgements about an individual's actions. ''Mens rea'' has to be judged by proxy, examining both a person's words and deeds. This becomes an even more complex task when applying the test an organisation, particularly as the harms caused by organisations result from the actions or inactions of a number of individuals and omission rather than intent. Therefore, harms caused by organisations are rarely criminalised.
* "Criminalisation and punishment inflict pain" – The criminal justice system has many stages which inflict pain in a discrete manner: defining, classifying, broadcasting, disposing and punishing the offender. Furthermore, these processes create wider social problems which bear no or little relationship to the initial crime and the original pain that was caused. For example, they may lead to loss of jobs, family problems or [[ostracism]].

==Harms of the criminal justice system==
Hillyard and Tombs argue that the criminal justice system fails to protect people from criminal harms whilst inflicting serious harms on those people who travel through the system. These harms often outweigh the harm caused by the original crime. However, current criminal justice policy within countries like the UK continues to champion the use of prison as a means to deal with social problems. In 2002, the UK prison population was 80,144. The population rate, per hundred thousand of national population, for England and Wales was 139. These figures are high compared to the rest of Europe in terms of overall numbers; however, looking at prison population rate, they are similar to many other countries in Europe. Italy, Spain, France, Romania and Belarus each had prison populations of around 50,000 in 2001–2002. Only Poland and the Ukraine had prison populations higher than that of the UK, at 82,173 and 198,885 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r188.pdf www.homeoffice.gov.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005045/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r188.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These rising prison numbers however do not necessarily reflect a rise in crime. Overall, since 1995 there has been a reduction in total crime. The [[British Crime Survey]] has shown that the overall crime experienced by households has declined by 42% which is the equivalent to eight million fewer crimes. More specifically, domestic burglary has fallen by 59%, vehicle theft has decreased by 61% and violent crimes have experienced a reduction of 41%. According to these figures it appears that the reason for the growth in the prison population is not due to a rise in crime.
In spite of the faith demonstrated by politicians in the criminal justice system, it would appear{{Says who|date=April 2015}} that the criminal justice system seems to fail in its own terms. The probability of a criminal re-offending is determined by external factors including having a stable family life, a home and a job. All of these are arguably weakened by a prison sentence. The [[Social Exclusion Task Force|Social Exclusion Unit]] has demonstrated that prison fails to rehabilitate on a dramatic scale with two thirds of prisoners re-offending within 2 years of release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifechangeuk.com/PDF%5CSEU%20-%20Reducing%20re-offending%20by%20ex-prisoners.pdf www.lifechangeuk.com: reducing re-offending by ex-prisoners]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a prison place costs £37,000 per annum.

=== Relation of welfare benefits to prison population ===

Concern has been expressed{{By whom|date=April 2015}} that the prison is being used as a mechanism to deal with social problems as spending on welfare benefits and services has decreased. Downes and Hansen argue that a country's welfare spending and prison population are inversely related, meaning that a country with high spending on welfare has a lower prison population and vice versa. Portugal, for example, has 147 prisoners per 100,000 people but spend only 18.2% of their GDP on welfare. This is quite a contrast to Scandinavian states, such as Sweden, whose prison population is 60 prisoners per 100,000 people as they spend 31% of GDP on welfare. During the 1990s the UK, whose spending on welfare is 20.8% GDP, saw an increase of 40% in the number of custodial sentences passed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/opus304.html|title=Welfare and punishment. The relationship between welfare spending and imprisonment|work=crimeandjustice.org.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is arguably reflected in the composition of the UK's prison population. For example, almost half of the prison population in Britain has been diagnosed with 3 or more mental disorders.&lt;ref name="revdoor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolving-doors.org.uk/documents/reports/Prisons_Britains_Social_Dustbin_070915.pdf|title=Documents - Revolving Doors Agency|work=revolving-doors.org.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107032201/http://www.revolving-doors.org.uk/documents/reports/Prisons_Britains_Social_Dustbin_070915.pdf|archive-date=7 January 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those prisoners diagnosed with a mental health problem: 50% of these prisoners are not registered with a GP; 42% of men with a psychotic disorder received no emotional or mental support in the previous year before imprisonment; 79% of men with a personality disorder received no emotional or mental support in the previous year before imprisonment; 46% have been arrested having never received any benefits despite their disorder; over a third are sleeping rough and over two thirds are not in education or training.&lt;ref name="revdoor"/&gt;

==Broadening perceptions of harm==
=== Physical harm ===

The zemiological or social harm approach attempts to broaden public and sociological focus to [[wikt:vicissitude#Noun|vicissitudes]] of daily life in capitalist society; some of these harms, they argue, are more harmful than those caused by crime. Approximately 1,000 people a year are murdered in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/crime0607summ.pdf www.homeoffice.gov.uk: crime 0607 Summary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324214809/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/crime0607summ.pdf |date=March 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are a number of events that cause large amounts of physical harm and even death, which are rarely considered crime or criminalised. In the UK there are around 40,000 serious road accidents in the UK every year. This is equivalent to a jumbo jet crashing every month. In 2002 3,431 people were killed on Britain’s roads and 35,976 seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/southeast/series7/cars.shtml|title=BBC Inside Out - Car Crash|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, 81,562 cases of food poisoning were reported and the majority of these cases are believed to have been contracted in food prepared outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2002/feb/campaign www.food.gov.uk campaign]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, The [[Labour Force Survey]] found that 228 people were killed while working due to a work-related incident and 2.2 million people with illnesses in the UK believed their condition was made worse by their past or current job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/lfs/lfs0708.pdf |title=www.hse.gov.uk |access-date=2014-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110181600/http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/lfs/lfs0708.pdf |archive-date=2014-01-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing phenomenon affecting workers' health is stress. A report issued by the British [[Health and Safety Executive]] found that 16% of workers were working over 60 hours a week.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Similarly, the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] found that 19% of men visited doctors for stress related problems, with that figure rising to 23% in men over 40. Also, the [[Trade Union Congress]] found 10% of work-based personal injury cases were stress-related.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hazards.org/workedtodeath/dropdead.pdf www.hazards.org]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Department of Health]] there were 3500 deaths occurring from the effects of [[Sulfur dioxide#Safety|sulphur dioxide]] and 8100 deaths were caused due to [[Particulate#Health effects|particulate matter]] in the air in July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;See: {{cite web|url=http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/statementsreports/airpol7.htm#results |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807174942/http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/statementsreports/airpol7.htm |archivedate=August 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homeowners ===

Equally, the financial costs theft and burglary are outweighed when one considers wider financial harms. For example, thousands of homeowners have been sold [[endowment mortgage]]s without any likely means of repaying them. More than 3 million homeowners face the likelihood that their endowment policy, when it matures, will be worth too little to pay off the mortgage. 60% of endowment mortgages are not on track to cover the original debt and 39,000 complainants looking to receive approximately £126 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2002/oct/27/endowments.observercashsection|title=Endowed with a sense of fear|author=Helen Monks|work=the Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today{{When|date=April 2015}} in Britain 9.5 million people cannot afford adequate housing conditions, 8 million cannot afford one or more essential good, 7.5 million people do not have enough money to attend social activities and 4 million do not receive proper nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/poverty/pse/sum_find.htm|title=1999 PSE - Summary Findings|work=bristol.ac.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responding to social harms ==

Whilst the UK and other liberal democracies spend large resources on their respective criminal justice systems, other regulatory and policy responses remain less well funded considering the extent and the serious nature of the harms they seek to prevent. This is illustrated through the following case examples.

=== Regulating the minimum wage ===

The minimum wage was introduced in 1998 to combat the problem of in-work poverty and inequality. The act established for the first time in the UK a minimum hourly rate of pay. In order, to guarantee that workers received the wage an enforcement structure was created using two methods. These were worker-led [[Industrial Tribunal]] claims and the minimum wage enforcement teams ([[Inland Revenue]]). Few workers have used the employment tribunals to recover money because many victims of breach of minimum wage are vulnerable, for example, ethnic minorities, youth, uneducated and non-unionsed workers. A more likely channel of action is the minimum wage enforcement teams, which are run by the Inland Revenue. These teams have a number of powers including power of entry into workplaces and seizure of employers' records. In order to enforce these regulations through a ‘pyramid of sanctions’,&lt;ref name="Pemberton, S 2008 pp. 32-34"&gt;Pemberton, S (2008) 'Regulating the minimum wage: a social harm perspective', Criminal Justice Matters, 74(1), (pp. 32-34),&lt;/ref&gt; which include: enforcement order, penalty enforcement and prosecution under criminal law. The enforcement order requests the employer to repay the worker any underpayment. If the employer refuses to comply with this requirement, penalty enforcement is issued which orders the firm to not only repay the worker (s), but to also pay a substantial fine. However, if the employer still refuses payment, as a consequence they will face prosecution under criminal law. This action can, however be seen as ineffective as only two companies have ever been prosecuted for such offences. The low rates of enforcement action are demonstrated below.

&lt;ref&gt;Low Pay Commission http://www.lowpay.gov.uk/lowpay/rep_a_p_index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated by the [[Low Pay Commission]] that 146,000–219,000 workers are not receiving the wage they are legally entitled too. It has been suggested that the reasons for relate to the limited resources available to the Inland Revenue Enforcement Teams.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, S (2008) 'Regulating the minimum wage: a social harm perspective', Criminal Justice Matters, 74(1), (pp. 32-34)&lt;/ref&gt; The Inland Revenue Enforcement Team consists of 16 compliance teams, each with 3 to 8 officers, based in fourteen towns and cities throughout the UK. In 1999 there were 115 Inspectors which meant that a workplace could expect to be inspected once every 30 years.&lt;ref name="Pemberton, S 2008 pp. 32-34" /&gt;

=== Policy responses to inequality ===

Inequality has grown in countries like the UK since the beginning of the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} It is argued that this growth in inequality has had a series of deleterious and harmful effects. These include children’s life chances, mental health, physical health, crime and social well being.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson RG 2009"&gt;Wilkinson RG, Pickett KE. (2009) ''The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better''. London: Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; Using the example of physical, numerous studies have demonstrated that those from lower socio economic classes have lower life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson RG 2009" /&gt; For instance a recent{{When|date=April 2015}} research study that investigated differences in health in the 678 electoral wards of the northern region of England found that death rates were four times as high in the poorest 10 per cent of wards as they were in the richest 10 per cent. In the 1980s more and more households fell into poverty and by the early 1990s one in three children lived below the poverty line.&lt;ref name="Toynbee P 2008"&gt;Toynbee P &amp; Walker D (2008) Unjust rewards. London: Granta&lt;/ref&gt;

Inequality is a harm that is perceived{{By whom|date=April 2015}} as an inherent and largely unpreventable feature of our society. Yet a number of academics attribute the current levels of inequality in the UK to a series of policy decisions that have been made over the last 30 years.&lt;ref name="Gordon, D. 1997"&gt;Gordon, D. &amp;  Pantazis, C. (1997) Breadline Britain in the 1990s. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the growing levels of inequality are numerous. The poorest groups in society have seen their income and wealth affected by developments such as the decreasing value of benefits in real terms, the deregulation of labour markets etc., whilst the rich have seen their wealth grow primarily as a result of the changes made in the UK tax system since 1979.&lt;ref name="Gordon, D. 1997"/&gt; In particular, the top rate of income tax was cut by the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]] in the first post-1979 election budget from 83% to 60%. Then it was cut to 40%. Moreover, tax havens have increased and become common place which has enabled wealthy individuals and companies to avoid taxation regimes. In fact, tax consultants Grant Thornton estimated that the UK’s 54 billionaires paid income tax of only £14.7 million in 2006. At least 32 paid no income tax at all. In contrast, according to the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]], £3.4 billion a year would lift enough families out of poverty to hit [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour’s]] pledge of halving child poverty by 2010.&lt;ref name="Toynbee P 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article658376.ece|title=Login|work=timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulating environmental harm ===

It is estimated that 24,000 lives are prematurely ended due to the effects of air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513065011/http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/ |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these health consequences are estimated to cost the UK £29,000 per life year lost in "good" health, £15,000 per life year lost in "poor" health and £1,900–£2,000 per hospital admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airquality.co.uk/annualreport/annualreport2007.php|title=Defra UK-AIR - air pollution information for the UK|work=airquality.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218064758/http://www.airquality.co.uk/annualreport/annualreport2007.php|archive-date=18 February 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the harm caused by air pollution the UK has a poor record in responding to air pollution. The [[European Union#Environment|European Union]] is currently{{When|date=April 2015}} considering prosecuting the British government for breaching air pollution laws. Air pollution near in a number of locations has been recorded at twice the UN's [[World Health Organization]] maximum recommended level, which has consequently infringed EU air quality laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jan/02/air-pollution-laws-britain-eu|title=UK faces court case over air pollution breaches|author=John Vidal|work=the Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Environment Agency, the UK's principal environmental regulator, has what some{{Who|date=April 2015}} may consider to be a poor record of prosecuting infringements of environmental standards. For example, there were 29,627 "substantiated" pollution incidents in 2003, of which 1337 were considered serious by the agency. However, in the same year the agency prosecuted 266 companies, 61 resulted in fines over £10,000. The average fine for companies was £8,412, down from £8,622 in 2002. There are approximately 20,000 incidents each year in the UK and around 250 prosecutions, which means there is a one in eighty chance of company being prosecuted for these incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/|title=Environment Agency - GOV.UK|work=environment-agency.gov.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulating health and safety at work ===

Large numbers of people each year lose their lives due to injuries and diseases that result from their work. In 2007–08, 229 workers were killed at work, whilst 136,771 other injuries to employees were reported under [[Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations|RIDDOR]] and 299,000 reportable injuries occurred, according to the Labour Force Survey. In addition, 2.1 million people were suffering from an illness they believed was caused or made worse by their current or past work. It is believed that 2056 people died of [[asbestos]] related diseases contracted through their work activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/causdis/asbestos.htm|title=Statistics - Asbestos related disease|work=hse.gov.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these large scale harms, the principal regulatory in the UK, the Health and Safety Executive, has faced continuing cuts, most notably the 2006 £5.6m reduction in the [[Health and Safety Executive|HSE]] budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazards.org/commissionimpossible/safetychips.htm|title=HSE is broke - Hazards Magazine issue 96|work=hazards.org|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has had major implications for the ability of the HSE to regulate workplaces with a decreasing numbers of regulatory contacts. A recent [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] report argued that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Around 85 per cent of major injuries reported to HSE are never investigated ... there is only so much that the 500 or so inspectors in HSE's Field Operations Division (FOD) can achieve. This means that very serious career-ending accidents go unpunished simply because there is no one to gather the evidence. The number of prosecutions is now half what it was in the early 1990s – this simply means that more employers are getting away with it, not that they are more compliant.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/tuc-12542-f0.cfm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003120740/https://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/tuc-12542-f0.cfm |date=October 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
