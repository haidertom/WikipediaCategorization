      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7885">'''Asset stripping''' is a term used to refer to the practice of selling off a company's [[asset]]s in order to improve returns for equity investors.  With a lower level of assets, it is maintained, the business is rendered financially less stable or viable.  For example, the sale-and-leaseback of a building would lead to an increased rental bill for the company.

The proceeds of the sale of assets may be used to lower the company's net debt. Alternatively, they may be used to pay a dividend to equityholders, leaving the company with lower [[net worth]] – i.e. the same level of debt but fewer assets (and weaker earnings) to support that debt.

In many cases where the term is used, a financial investor, referred to as a '[[corporate raid]]er', [[takeover|takes control of]] another company and then auctions off the acquired company's assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset Stripping|url=http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Asset-stripping|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is generally used in a [[pejorative]] sense as such activity is not considered helpful to the company.  Asset stripping has been considered to be a problem in economies such as [[Russia]] or [[China]] which are making a transition to being market economies.  In these situations, managers of a state-owned company have been known to sell the assets they control, leaving behind nothing but debts to the state.

==History==

Early innovators of asset stripping were [[Carl Icahn]], [[Victor Posner]], and [[Nelson Peltz]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Mark|title=King Icahn|date=May 2014|publisher=Createspace|page=4|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of whom were investors in the 1970s and 1980s. Carl Icahn performed one of the most notorious and hostile takeovers when he acquired [[Trans World Airlines]] in 1985. Here Icahn stripped TWA of its assets, selling them individually to repay the debt assimilated during the takeover. This particular corporate raid formed the idea of selling a company's assets in order to repay debt, and eventually increase the raider's net worth.

One of the biggest corporate raids that failed to materialize was the takeover of [[Gulf Oil]] by [[T. Boone Pickens]]. In 1984, Pickens attempted to acquire Gulf Oil and sell its assets individually to gain net worth. However, the purchase would have had been severely detrimental to [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]; a customer of Gulf Oil. Therefore, Chevron stepped-in and [[Merger|merged]] with Gulf Oil for $13.2 billion, which at that time was the biggest merger between two companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mattera|first1=Phillip|title=Chevron: The Big Oil Boys|url=http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1992/04/mm0492_11.html |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[BC Partners]] acquired [[Phones 4u]] for a fee in the region of £700 million. At this point in time Phones 4u had already entered [[Administration (law)|administration]] and had deep financial struggles. However, this did not prevent BC Partners from taking a £223 million dividend in order to pay off some of its own debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset-stripping by bosses finished Phones4U|url=http://socialistworker.co.uk/art/39005/Asset-stripping+by+bosses+finished+Phones4U |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ownership of BC Partners, Phones 4u had very little [[Financial independence|financial freedom]] to expand and claim back the contract of EE. In September 2014 [[O2 (United Kingdom)|O2]], [[Vodafone UK|Vodafone]] and [[Hutchinson 3G|Three]] decided to withdraw the rights for Phones 4u to sell their products. Due to the already poor financial situation of Phones 4u, the company has now no alternative but to sell its individual assets and close down. The net worth of Phones 4u's assets are estimated to exceed £1.4 billion, which provides BC Partners with the credit to pay off some of its debts and significantly improve its net worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Partington|first1=Adam|title=Ex-Phones 4U employee: How the retailer fell down around our ears, and BC Partners forgot to say goodbye |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/business/markets/exphones-4u-employee-how-the-retailer-fell-down-around-our-ears-and-bc-partners-forgot-to-say-goodbye-9787723.html |publisher=London Evening Standard|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Asset stripping is highly controversial topic within the financial world. The benefits of asset stripping generally go to the corporate raiders, who can slash the debts they may have whilst improving their net worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pettinger|first1=Tejvan|title=Asset Stripping|url=http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/asset-stripping/ |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, since asset stripping often results in thousands of employees losing their jobs without much consideration of the consequences to the affected community, the concept can be unpopular in the public sphere. One particular example of where asset stripping cost a significant number of workers their jobs was in the [[Fontainebleau Resort Las Vegas|Fontainebleau Las Vegas LLC]] case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stutz|first1=Howard|title=Removal of Fontainebleau's construction crane signals doom for ill-fated Strip hotel|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/economy/removal-fontainebleau-s-construction-crane-signals-doom-ill-fated-strip-hotel |publisher=Stephens Media LLC|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the takeover, 433 people lost their jobs when assets were sold off and the company was stripped.

==In the United Kingdom==
The process of asset stripping is not an illegal practice. If a corporate raider sells the target companies assets individually and pays off its debts the [[financial regulator]]s have no room for investigation. However, some firms perform the process illegally and if found guilty may incur a substantial fine or even prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset Stripping |url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/corporate-fraud/asset-stripping.aspx |publisher=Crown |accessdate=30 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030194421/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/corporate-fraud/asset-stripping.aspx |archivedate=30 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asset stripping by private equity firms in Europe is now regulated pursuant to the [[Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive]].

===Phoenixing===

This is one of two methods a corporate raider can use to strip assets illegally. For this method to work, the corporate raider and the targeted firm must have the same director. Assets of the targeted firm are transferred to the corporate raider to ensure they remain safe from debt collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset Stripping|url=http://www.lawontheweb.co.uk/Fraud_Law/Asset_Stripping |publisher=Law on the Web|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process lets the corporate raider improve their net worth while leaving liabilities with the targeted company.

===Liquidation===

This method acts on completely fraudulent terms, and results in a higher punishment from the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA). Here, corporate raiders take ownership of a company on hostile terms, transfer the assets to their name and then put the dilapidated firm into liquidation. This ensures that the corporate raider improves their net worth, and has no liability to deal with the firm recently placed into liquidation. In comparison to phoenixing, this method has the highest rate of jail sentences issued for those found guilty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2469">The '''average accounting return''' (AAR) is the average project earnings after [[taxes]] and [[depreciation]], divided by the average [[book value]] of the investment during its life.
Approach to making capital budgeting decisions involves the average accounting return(AAR). There are many different definitions of the AAR. However, in one form or another, the AAR is always defined as: Some measure of average accounting profit divided by some measure of average accounting value. The specific definition we will use is: Average net income divided by Average book value. It is kinds of decision rule to accept or reject the finance project. For decide to these projects value, it needs cutoff rate. This rate is kind of deadline whether this project produces net income or net loss.  
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Corporate Finance|author1=Ross, Stephen A.|author1link=Stephen Ross (economist) |author2=Randolph W. Westerfield |author3=Jeffrey Jaffe |last-author-amp=yes |pages=166|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-310590-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three steps to calculating the AAR.

First, determine the average [[net income]] of each year of the project's life. Second, determine the average [[investment]], taking depreciation into account. Third, determine the AAR by dividing the average net income by the average investment. After determine the AAR, compare with target cutoff rate. For example, if AAR determined is 20%, and given cutoff rate is 25%, then this project should be rejected. Because AAR is lower than cutoff rate so this project will not make sufficient net income to cover initial cost. Average accounting return(AAR) does have advantages and disadvantages. Advantages; It is easy to calculate than other capital budgeting decision rules. It only needs net income data and book values of the investment during its life. Another advantage is needed information will usually be available. Disadvantage; it does not take time value of money into account. When we average figures that occur at different times, we are treating the near future and the more distant future in the same way. Therefore, there is no clear indication of profitability. And also should use an arbitrary benchmark cutoff rate is kind of disadvantage thing. The last disadvantage is it is based on accounting net income and book values, not cash flows and market values.

==History==
Founded as '''Banca Popolare Agricola di Mutuo Credito''' in 1870, the Crema-based bank was later known as '''Banca Popolare di Crema'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bancopopolare.it/banca-popolare-di-crema/la-storia/|title=La Storia|access-date=21 December 2016|publisher=Banco Popolare|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a subsidiary [[Banca Popolare di Lodi]] (via sub-holding [[Reti Bancarie]] from 2003 to 2006) and then as a subsidiary of [[Banco Popolare]] since 2007.

In the context of traditional development economics it was often recognised ([[Frances Stewart (economist)|Stewart]]  (1972) for example) that this choice was central to development strategies and that such choices were inter-twined with decisions over the type of goods to be produced and the scale of operation of an industry.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Amartya.

To '''counterfeit''' means to imitate something. Counterfeit products are fakes or unauthorized replicas of the real product. Counterfeit products are often produced with the intent to take advantage of the superior value of the imitated product. The word ''counterfeit'' frequently describes both the forgeries of [[currency]] and [[document]]s, as well as the imitations of items such as [[clothing]], [[handbags]], [[shoes]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, aviation and automobile parts, [[watch]]es, [[electronics]] (both parts and finished products), [[software]], works of [[art]], [[toys]], and [[movies]].&lt;ref&gt;"Physical Unclonable Functions in Theory and Practice", p. 46, by Christoph Böhm, Maximilian Hofer&lt;/ref&gt; 

Counterfeit products tend to have fake company [[logos]] and [[brands]] (resulting in [[patent infringement|patent]] or [[trademark infringement]] in the case of goods), have a reputation for being lower quality (sometimes not working at all) and may even include toxic elements such as lead. This has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, due to automobile and aviation accidents, poisoning, or ceasing to take essential compounds (e.g., in the case a person takes non-working medicine).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipcybercrime.com/counterfeit-culture/ Counterfeit culture documentary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[counterfeit money|counterfeiting of money]] is usually attacked aggressively by governments worldwide. Paper money is the most popular product counterfeited.

==Forgery of money or government bonds==
{{Main|Counterfeit money}}
Counterfeit money is currency that is produced without the legal sanction of the state or government and in deliberate violation of that country's laws.

The [[United States Secret Service]], mostly known for its guarding-of-officials task,  was initially organized primarily to combat the counterfeiting of American money. Counterfeit [[government bonds]] are public debt instruments that are produced without legal sanction, with the intention of "cashing them in" for authentic currency or using them as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] to secure legitimate loans or lines of credit.

==Counterfeiting of documents==
{{Main|Forgery}}

[[Forgery]] is the process of making or adapting documents with the intention to deceive.  It is a form of [[fraud]], and is often a key technique in the execution of [[identity theft]]. [[Uttering and publishing]] is a term in United States law for the forgery of non-official documents, such as a trucking company's time and weight logs.

[[Questioned document examination]] is a scientific process for investigating many aspects of various documents, and is often used to examine the provenance and verity of a suspected forgery. [[Security printing]] is a [[printing]] industry specialty, focused on creating legal documents which are difficult to forge.

==Counterfeiting of consumer goods==

The spread of counterfeit goods (commonly called "knock-offs" or "rip-offs") has become global in recent years and the range of goods subject to infringement has increased significantly. Apparel and accessories accounted for over 50 percent of the counterfeit goods seized by U.S Customs and Border Control. According to the study of Counterfeiting Intelligence Bureau (CIB) of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), counterfeit goods make up 5 to 7% of World Trade; however, these figures cannot be substantiated due to the secretive nature of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;ICC Counterfeiting Intelligence Bureau (1997), Countering Counterfeiting: A Guide to Protecting and Enforcing Intellectual Property Rights, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A report by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] indicates that up to US$200 Billion of international trade could have been in counterfeit and illegally copied goods in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/13/12/38707619.pdf | title= The Economic Effect of Counterfeiting and Piracy, Executive Summary | publisher = OECD, Paris | year = 2007 | accessdate=November 15, 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, the OECD updated these estimates, concluding that the share of counterfeit and illegitimate goods in world trade had increased from 1.85% in 2000 to 1.95% in 2007. That represents an increase to US$250 billion worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/57/27/44088872.pdf | title= Magnitude of counterfeiting and piracy of tangible products – November 2009 update | publisher = OECD, Paris | year = 2009 | accessdate=November 15, 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When calculating counterfeit products, current estimates place the global losses at $400 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.havocscope.com/activities/counterfeit-and-piracy/| title= Havocscope Counterfeit and Piracy Markets by Products | accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 29, 2010, the [[Department of Homeland Security]] seized and shut down 82 websites as part of a U.S. crackdown of websites that sell counterfeit goods, and was timed to coincide with "Cyber Monday," the start of the holiday online shopping season.&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/11/us-website-takedowns/ "U.S. Shutters 82 Sites in Crackdown on Downloads, Counterfeit Goods"] ''Wired'' magazine, November 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Some see the rise in counterfeiting of goods as being related to [[globalisation]].  As more and more companies, in an effort to increase profits, move manufacturing to the cheaper labour markets of the third world, areas with weaker labour laws or environmental regulations, they give the means of production to foreign workers.  These new managers of production have little or no loyalty to the original corporation.  They see that profits are being made by the global brand for doing little (other than advertising) and see the possibilities of removing the middle men (i.e. the parent corporation) and marketing directly to the consumer. This can result in counterfeit products being virtually indistinguishable from original products, as they are being produced in the same company, and in damage to the parent corporation due to copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="SCHMIDLE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22fake-t.html?scp=1&amp;sq=putian&amp;st=cse&amp;_r=0|title=Inside the Knockoff-Tennis-Shoe Factory|last=Schmidle|first=Nicholas|date=19 August 2010

Certain [[final good|consumer goods]], especially very expensive or desirable brands or those that are easy to reproduce cheaply, have become frequent and common targets of counterfeiting. The counterfeiters either attempt to deceive the consumer into thinking they are purchasing a legitimate item, or convince the consumer that they could deceive others with the imitation. An item which makes no attempt to deceive, such as a copy of a DVD with missing or different cover art or a book without a cover, is often called a "bootleg" or a "pirated copy" instead.

Counterfeiting has also been issued to "cash in" on the ever growing record collecting market. One major example is bootleggers have cloned copies of Elvis Presley's early singles for [[Sun Records]] since original copies starting changing hands amongst music fans for hundreds (and then, thousands) of [[US$]]. Some who produce these even do so with the wrong material. For example the song "Heartbreak Hotel" which was never released on Sun, as by the time Elvis' first heard it, prior to ever recording it, he had moved from Sun to [[RCA Victor]]. Rare releases by [[The Beatles]] such as their album with the [[butcher cover]], fan-club only released Christmas records and early demonstration discs issued by [[EMI]] are also examples of product reproduced by counterfeiters due to their high value to collectors.

Many counterfeit goods are produced and manufactured in China, making it the counterfeit capital of the world. In fact, the counterfeiting industry accounts for 8% of China's GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.asiabusinesscouncil.org/docs/IntellectualPropertyRights.pdf| title= Intellectual Property Rights | accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.mit.edu/cis/fpi_china.html| title= MIT CIS: Publications: Foreign Policy Index | accessdate = 15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counterfeit goods are produced and manufactured in Russia, North Korea, Taiwan, Bulgaria, and Greece as well. Greece is responsible for 2% of counterfeit goods seized by the EU. Some counterfeits are produced in the same factory that produces the original, authentic product, using inferior materials.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}  

Another trend in counterfeiting, especially seen in consumer electronics, is the manufacture of entirely new products using poor quality materials or, more often, incorporating desirable features not present in a brand's authentic product line and then including prominent and fake brand names and logotypes to profit from brand recognition or brand image. An example would be imitation "Nokia" and "iPhone" cellular phones with features like [[dual SIM]] slots or analog [[TV]], which are unavailable in authentic originals,&lt;ref name="shanzhaiji"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com.au/shanzhai-ji-all-you-need-to-know-about-fake-phones-339297258.htm|title=Shanzhai ji: All you need to know about fake phones - Mobile Phones|publisher=CNET|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CECT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/dual_sim-review-154p2.php|title=Dual SIM review: Mobiles go two-in-one - page 2|date=3 August 2007|work=GSM Arena|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or cosmetically-identical clones of high-end [[smartphone]]s such as those from [[Hong Kong]]-based [[Goophone]], using off the shelf [[system-on-chip]]s from [[MediaTek]]&lt;ref name="Fingas"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/05/goophone-lg-rolling-out-tri-sim-smartphones/|title=GooPhone and LG to offer first tri-SIM smartphones using MediaTek chips|last=Fingas|first=Jon|date=5 August 2013|work=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system, often with [[user interfaces]] made to resemble the devices they imitate.&lt;ref name="Esposito"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9to5google.com/2014/07/24/hands-on-with-a-functional-4-7-inch-iphone-6-clone-w-heavily-detailed-skinned-version-of-android-video/|title=Hands-on with a functional 4.7-inch iPhone 6 clone w/ heavily detailed, skinned version of Android (Video)|last=Esposito|first=Dom|date=24 July 2014|work=9to5Google|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example would be imitation [[S1 MP3 player|"iPod" MP3]] players whose batteries are removable and replaceable, whereas in authentic originals the batteries are permanently installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/au/pictures/fake-ipod-versus-the-real-thing/|title=Fake iPod versus the real thing|last=Chase|first=Brendon|author2=Derek Fung|date=8 October 2009|work=[[CNET]]|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Humphries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/apple/l-a-police-seize-10-million-worth-of-counterfeit-iphones-ipods-1311540/|title=L.A. police seize $10 million worth of counterfeit iPhones &amp; iPods|last=Humphries|first=Matthew|date=8 February 2011|work=[[Geek.com]]|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States, a federal crackdown on counterfeit imports is driving an increase in domestic output of fake merchandise, according to investigators and industry executives. Raids carried out in New York City resulted in the seizure of an estimated $200 Million in counterfeit apparel, bearing the logos of brands such as "[[The North Face]]," "[[Ralph Lauren Polo|Polo]]," "[[Izod Lacoste]]," "[[Rocawear]]," "[[7 for All Mankind|Seven for all Mankind]]," and "[[FUBU|Fubu]]." One of the largest seizures was a joint operation in Arizona, Texas and California that seized seventy-seven containers of fake "[[Air Jordan|Nike Air Jordan]]" shoes and a container of "[[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]]" clothing, valued at $69.5 million. Another current method of attacking counterfeits is at the retail level. [[Fendi]] sued the [[Sam's Club]] division of [[Walmart]] for selling fake "Fendi" bags and leather goods in five states. Sam's Club agreed to pay Fendi a confidential amount to settle the dispute and dismiss the action. In the case ''[[Tiffany v. eBay]]'', [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]] sued auction site [[eBay]] for allowing the sale of counterfeit items, but lost on all claims.  [[Gucci]] filed suit against thirty websites in the United States and is currently{{when|date=December 2010}} in the process of suing one hundred more.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

A number of companies involved in the development of anti-counterfeiting and brand protection solutions have come together to form special industry-wide and global organisations dedicated to combating the so-called "brand pirates" such as the [[International Hologram Manufacturers Association]].  Other companies and organisations have established web-based communities that provide a framework for crowd-sourced solutions to counterfeiting.  One such free community, Collectors Proof&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.CollectorsProof.com |title=Collectors Proof |accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; enables manufacturers and users alike to associate unique identification numbers to virtually any item so that each new owner can update its chain of custody.  Because quality counterfeit items are often difficult to discern from authentic goods, this approach enables potential customers to access an item's current and previous owners{{snd}}its [[provenance]]{{snd}}prior to purchase.

To combat counterfeiting, companies may have the various parts of an item manufactured in independent factories and then limit the supply of certain distinguishing parts to the factory that performs the final assembly to the exact number required for the number of items to be assembled (or as near to that number as is practicable) or may require the factory to account for every part used and to return any unused, faulty or damaged parts. To help distinguish the originals from the counterfeits, the copyright holder may also employ the use of serial numbers or holograms etc., which may be attached to the product in another factory still.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

== Counterfeit Culture ==
Counterfeit culture is the thriving markets surrounding fake [[streetwear]]. Most commonly, these markets originate out of areas where the inability to buy popular streetwear brands has fueled more sophisticated markets for counterfeit goods. These markets have spawned the emergence of a tribe of widely available [[wikt:copycat|copycat]] brands.

In countries like [[South Korea]] and [[Russia]] where trade sanctions have been imposed historically to monitor and prevent the circulation of popular brands have instead created a demand for readily available counterfeit alternatives. The economic standing of a country or region also contributed to the demand for these products as the average consumer can’t afford [[luxury goods|luxury]] prices but will gain the same social impact purchasing a [[Counterfeit consumer goods|knock-off]] that’s of almost indistinguishable quality to the original product. 

Streetwear is out of reach for many people, not just because of international sanctions and low wages, but because exclusivity is built into it business model. Social and cultural forces are driving the unique fashion scene. In particular, social media has a huge influence on over these markets giving people images of things they can’t own and further fueling the desire to obtains certain “[[wikt:hype|hype]]d” items by any means accessible.

Designers have even begun to acknowledge the [[Fashion trend|trend]] of counterfeit culture by referencing fake or knock-off goods in their designs. This brought counterfeit culture into the realm of [[mainstream culture]] and has essentially shifted global acceptance towards becoming more lenient of these products as an appropriate alternative.

The '''Dental Laboratories Association''' (DLA) is the professional body for dental laboratory owners in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is estimated that members of the DLA are responsible for over 80 per cent of the dental laboratory services in the UK.

== Origin ==
The DLA began as a division of the Surgical Instrument Manufacturers Association, later becoming a separate entity. The first meeting of the DLA Council took place in London in 1961. The first Secretary was John Wrench and administration was provided by a firm of accountants called Hughes Allan. 

In 1977 Trevor Roadley, a [[Nottingham]] dental laboratory owner was appointed as Secretary. Operating initially at his laboratory and then in the DLA's first premises, Roadley gradually built up the range of member services and heightened the standing of the association. The DLA moved to larger premises in Nottingham in 1986, a converted chapel that was being used as a dental laboratory. At this stage the DLA had approximately 400 members. In 1987 Bill Courtney took over as Secretary. Like Trevor before him, Bill was a dental laboratory owner and member of the DLA Council. 

By now the DLA was a recognised and respected member of the dental world and regularly met with organisations such as the [[General Dental Council]], [[Orthodontic Technicians Association]], [[British Dental Association]] and the [[Department of Health]]. These close relationships continue to this day and the DLA has presented evidence to the [[Health Select Committee]] at the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on the challenges faced by the profession. 

The DLA was instrumental in setting up the Dental Technicians Education and Training Advisory Board (DTETAB), which is now known as the [[Dental Technologists Association]] (DTA). The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the emergence of the [[Medical Devices Directive]] and the introduction of Quality Systems to the industry. The DLA worked to establish an industry-led standard and the first example of this was a system based on BS 5750 called the Certification Authority for Dental Laboratories and Suppliers (CADLAS), which is still operating as AMTAC MEDICA and is now audited to ISO9002. With the lessons learned in setting up CADLAS, a new system called the Dental Appliance Manufacturers Audit Scheme (DAMAS) was launched in 1998. This is based around ISO 9000 and also addresses the Medical Devices Regulations (MDR). 

By now the Association membership had risen to over 900 and the association moved into new offices at Arboretum Gate in February 1997.  

There have been many changes since 2000, including the retirement of Bill Courtney and appointment of Richard Daniels as Chief Executive. Membership has passed the 1,000 mark, and the DLA is building a profile as a campaigning organisation with appearances across the media.

== Offices ==
In May 2001 the Association moved to their current offices on Wollaton Road, [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]] in [[Nottingham]].

== Logo ==
The DLA logo is circular in shape with the initials "DLA" in the middle.

== Current activities ==
The DLA's current projects include:

*DAMAS 
*Occupational standards for technicians 
*Training trainers (lab owners) 
*Business advice systems 
*Business seminars 
*Health &amp; safety advice 
*Employment advice 
*Materials non-conformance reporting 
*British Standards (including sports mouthguards) 
*Statutory Registration of technicians 
*Lobbying for ringfenced fees for NHS work 
*Running conferences, exhibitions and seminars 
*Regional meetings and roadshows 
*European affairs concerning laboratories 
*IDEA - Inspiring Dental Education &amp; Advice 

The DLA is a member of the [[British Dental Health Foundation]] (BDHF), the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]] (RoSPA) and the Federation of European Dental Laboratory Owners (FEPPD). 

==Events==
===Dental Technology Showcase (DTS)===
As the flagship event of the Dental Laboratories Association (DLA), the Dental Technology Showcase (DTS) is a highly respected platform for dental technicians, clinical dental technicians and lab owners to update and refresh their knowledge and skills.

Held alongside The Dentistry Show since 2014, the event offers vast networking opportunities as well as outstanding education, verifiable CPD and access to the very latest innovations in the UK industry.

DTS 2015 will take place on Friday 17th and Saturday 18th April at the NEC in Birmingham UK, ensuring a convenient and central location for thousands of dental professionals to attend. An extensive trade exhibition will host over 100 leading dental suppliers and manufacturers including 3Shape, Bracon, Cendres + Metaux, [[Nobel Biocare]], [[Straumann]], Metrodent, Ivoclar Vivadent and Schottlander to name but a few, each demonstrating the latest products, materials and technologies available. Experts will be on hand to provide any information, advice or guidance you may need, helping you to choose the most suitable equipment for optimal clinical results, streamlined workflows and maximum return on investment.

Further information about DTS can be found online: http://www.the-dts.co.uk/

== Council ==
The DLA Council is the governing body of the association and is elected by the members. The DLA is run by the Nationally Elected Council. All member laboratories may send an observer to Council meetings.

'''''Detroit''''' is a turn-based [[business simulation game]] that puts one in charge of a fledgling automobile company starting in 1908 (the year the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Ford Model T|Model T]] was introduced). The player is responsible for the financing, research and development, design, testing, production, and marketing of automobile product lines. The aim of the game is to be the most profitable automobile business in the world after 100 years.

The game is named after the American city of [[Detroit]] which is nicknamed "Motor City" due to the concentration of American automobile manufacturers in the city during the 20th century.

==Gameplay==
The player starts off with a factory and a number of distributors. The player is always set against three competitors, which can be either human or computer. The game tends to follow common steps in a project lifecycle which involves the planning of a product, development of a product, testing of a product and its release to the public. The player is expected to follow this process whenever they wish to develop a new automobile.

Each turn is one month, and the game lasts approximately 100 years. At the start of each month, the player is presented with a money ledger showing the prior month's business. At this time newspapers also announce if cars are doing well or if there are special world events. World events that vastly effect gameplay are: [[World War I]], [[The Great Depression]], [[World War II]], and the [[1973 oil crisis|energy crisis of the 1970s]]. Most of these events negatively affect demand for all cars, with the exception of the energy crisis which targets low-mileage vehicles.

If at any time the player is bankrupt for long enough, the game ends with a scene of the player's avatar jumping out of a window.

The different aspects of the business are covered by different buildings at the factory (which is actually a pictorial representation of the main menu). Clicking on one of these buildings will bring up the following departments:

===Manager's office===
The manager's office acts as the player's interface to the numbers end of the business. Available from here is financial data concerning car models, factory production numbers, competition information, car reviews, and more. The player can manage the number of employees at factories, hire and fire new employees for factories, manage salaries (especially important to keep workers from striking), and commission reports to find out more about their automobiles.

A unique feature available in the manager's office is the ability to print most reports to the computer's printer.

===Research and development===
The research and development screen allows the player to invest their researchers into fields of development. These fields range from aesthetic changes such as body shape) to more technical ones such as new engines, suspension, brakes, safety and luxury features. The game references many real-world auto features as the fields progress, such as "drum brakes", "windshield wipers", and more.

===Design and testing===
One of the core parts of the gameplay is the ability to design new vehicles. Designing the body involves choosing what type of automobile (car, truck, etc.) and then three main sections of the car: the front, middle, and rear. Color can also be specified but has no discernible impact on the sales or reviews of the car.

As the player's research and development team develops more advanced features for the car, they become available on the design screen. However, all the parts have an associated cost and drive up the cost of the vehicle. They also affect the test results of the car. As time progresses, the public will demand different styles of car. For example, in the energy crisis, consumers will demand more fuel efficient cars. Ultimately it can be a game of trial-and-error finding a vehicle that the public likes.

During the testing phase the car is tested and then given a rating for handling in a corner, braking, acceleration, capacity (cargo and passenger), fuel economy, and safety. Generally, the better performance of the car, the more likely its success, especially if it conforms to the demands of the time or excels against the competition.

===Manufacturing and sales===
The manufacturing and sales screen allows the player to manage the production and distribution of vehicles. A world map of territories is displayed, whereby the player can click individual territories to display the factory and showroom in a territory. Here one can open or close down new factories and showrooms or upgrade the level of factories to make them more productive. Supply routes between factories and showrooms are also set and prioritized on this screen. The price of vehicles in each territory can also be set here.

===Marketing===
Here the player can invest funds into marketing of vehicles through various forms of media. Some will be more effective than others depending in which year the player is at in the game. Examples of media one can advertise with include billboards, newspapers, women's magazines, radio and television.

==Bugs and limitations==
* The game shipped with a bug where sometimes workers would disappear from production and research lines. The patch that fixes the bug introduces a problem whereby sometimes lines would inexplicably gain thousands of workers, drowning the player in overhead.
* All production (and research) lines are limited to 255 workers each. Factories are limited to six lines apiece.
* Many times demand can inexplicably decline or altogether cease for a vehicle, even if it is competitively priced and held in high reviews.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' rated ''Detroit'' two stars out of five. Describing it as "a puzzle game rather than a true strategy game", the magazine criticized the fixed demand values, repetitive gameplay, and unrealistic depiction of historical events.&lt;ref name="cgw199408"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Emrich |first=Alan |last2=Schlunk |first2=Petra |date=August 1994 |title='What's Good for GM is Good for America' |department= |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&amp;pub=2&amp;id=121 |magazine=Computer Gaming World |pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Duncan Robert Yorke Bluck''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (19 March 1927 – 6 October 2015) was a British businessman. He joined the [[Butterfield &amp; Swire]] in 1948 and became the commercial manager and subsequently the managing director of the [[Cathay Pacific Airways]] in the 1960s and 70s. Under his managership, the Cathay Pacific expanded extensively its airline's network and transformed into a major international carrier. From 1981 to 84, he was the chairman of the Swire Group in Hong Kong. He had also been chairman of [[Hong Kong Tourist Association]] and chairman of the [[British Tourist Authority]] and [[English Tourist Board]] after he returned to England in 1984.

==Early life and joining the Swires==
Bluck was born in Shanghai on 19 March 1927. His father Thomas was a draper's assistant in Leicester as a young man. He joined the department store, Whiteaway, Laidlaw &amp; Co. and was sent to its Shanghai branch. Duncan was named after Major General Sir [[John Duncan (British Army officer)|John Duncan]], commander of the [[Shanghai Defence Force]].

Duncan was sent to a boarding school, [[Taunton School]] in England in 1939, right before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]]. His parents were later interned at the [[Lunghua Civilian Assembly Centre|Lunghua camp]] in Shanghai. Duncan did not see them again until 1945. When he met his mother off a ship he brought a photograph in case he did not recognise her.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; In 1944, he joined the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] and served in the Mediterranean and Far East until he was demobilised in 1947.&lt;ref name="swire"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://swirenews.swire.com/2016-01/People/Duncan-Bluck.html|title=Obituary – Duncan Bluck|work=Swire News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he decided to join the British Far East trading firm [[Butterfield &amp; Swire]]. He was interviewed by [[Jock Swire]] in London in early 1948 and was sent by [[Sunderland flying boat]] to Hong Kong. He was involved with shipping, mostly in Japan when it was under the military rule from 1948 to 1953.&lt;ref name="swire"/&gt;

On his first leave, Bluck was engaged with Stella and married in March 1952. The couple was known to be kind to the junior staff.&lt;ref name="swire"/&gt;

==Cathay Pacific career==
A carerr-changing opportunity came in 1953, when Bluck was sent to Bangkok to open a new branch for the [[Cathay Pacific Airways]]. At the time, the fleet consisted of only two [[DC-3]]s and one [[DC-4]] Skymaster. The DC-4 operated the Hong Kong-Bangkok-Singapore route five times a day and a weekly Hong Kong-Bangkok-Calcutta flight.&lt;ref name="swire"/&gt;

In 1954, Bluck took up the position of commercial manager of the Cathay Pacific at the age of 27, the airline's most senior non-engineering post.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Duncan Bluck, businessman – obituary|date=21 October 2015|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11945840/Duncan-Bluck-businessman-obituary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his spell, he was able to acquire the northbound routes at the time the routes from Hong Kong to Mainland China, Taiwan and Japan were given by the government to [[Hong Kong Airways]] (HKA), a subsidiary of the [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC). The HKA had to sellits fleet and chartered out its traffic rights to the American [[Northwest Airlines]] after it lost the Mainland market.&lt;ref name="swire"/&gt; Bluck foresaw the potential of the Japanese market, and thus he asked for the northbound rights from the government, unless HKA flew its own planes. In 1959, the BOAC swapped HKA for a part of the shares in the Cathay Pacific as predicted by Bluck, and thus opened the Japanese and Taiwanese market to Cathay.&lt;ref name="swire"/&gt;

[[File:Convair 880-22M VR-HGG Cathay MIA 04.10.75 (2).jpg| [[Convair 880]]M, [[Cathay Pacific]]'s first jet aircraft.|thumb|left]]
At the time the boss of the Swire Group, Jock Swire was knocked out of the Hong Kong-Sydney route by [[Qantas]], the Australian state carrier.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Bluck belonged to the pro-expansion lobby with [[W. C. G. Knowles|Bill Knowles]], opposed to the anti-expansionists including Jock Browne and John Browne. [[John Bremridge]], the managing director held a middle position but leaned towards Jock-like caution. Bluck gave a vision of global expansionism in a report he wrote after a five-week tour in North America in 1961, pointing out the potential business opportunity in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond Lion Rock: The Story of Cathay Pacific Airways|first=Gavin|last=Young|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Cathay Pacific acquired its first jet aircraft, the [[Convair 880]]M and formed a joint venture air catering company with the [[Peninsula Group]]. The partnership provided the impetus to take on catering for other airlines which eventually led to the founding of the Cathay Pacific Catering Services. In April 1964, Bluck joined the Board of the Cathay Pacific Airways.&lt;ref name="swire"/&gt;

In 1968, Bluck was sent to [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] to take over as chairman of the Bahamas Airways, which Swire in conjunction with [[P&amp;O (company)|P&amp;O]] and [[Blue Funnel Line]] acquired from the BOAC. During his two-year chairmanship, the airways crumpled financially as the Bahamian government exclusively licensed the national carrier BAL to fly long haul routes. Swire had to put the airline into voluntary liquidation as a result.&lt;ref name="swire"/&gt;

==Cathay and Swires Taipan==
Bluck returned to Hong Kong in January 1971 as the managing director of Cathay Pacific. Bluck persuaded the company to introduce its first long-haul [[Boeing 707]]s and its first wide-bodied aircraft, the [[Lockheed TriStar]] in 1973 and 1975 respectively. With the new aircraft, Cathay was able to expand its route network substantially. In 1976, the airline started its first expansion by flying to Bahrain.&lt;ref name="swire"/&gt;

[[File:Cathay Pacific Boeing 747-400 Spijkers.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boeing 747-400]] which helped Cathay Pacific to expand its network to London in 1970s.]]
Bluck aimed to expand the airline's network to London, which was monopolised by the [[British Airways]] by that time. Equipped with [[Boeing 747]], Cathay launched its first challenge with [[Caledonian Airways]] (B-Cal) and the low-cost carrier, [[Laker Airways]]. After a series of hearing before the Hong Kong's Air Transport Licensing Authority, licences were granted to Cathay Pacific and B-Cal. However, the CCA in London revoked Cathay's licence, on the basis that the B-Cal's [[DC-10]] was more suitable to operate the route. Swire appealed to the [[Minister of State for Trade]]. All three carriers were given licences at the end as a compromise. On the next day, Bluck's team hanged up the huge banners with the message "Cathay Pacific flies to London" as a sign of success.&lt;ref name="swire"/&gt; Following the London route, the company subsequently acquired routes to North America.

On 1 January 1981, Bluck was appointed chairman, the [[taipan]] of the Swire in Hong Kong, and served simultaneously as chairman of all the major Swire companies in Hong Kong. Under his spell, Bluck was known for his determined focus and perfectionism, qualities particularly admired by his Chinese colleagues.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; During his time, the company expanded in particular of the property field. By the end of Bluck's tenure in 1984, Cathay Pacific had been transformed into a major international carrier.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; He was also the director of the [[Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]], chairman of the [[Hong Kong Tourist Association]] and the English Schools Federation and member of the financial committee of the [[University of Hong Kong]]. In 1984, he was awarded Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE).&lt;ref name="swire"/&gt;

==British and English Tourist Authorities==
He retired from Swire in April 1984 and joined the parent board of [[John Swire &amp; Sons]] (JS&amp;S) in London. He remained heavily involved with Cathay Pacific and Swire Pacific until he stepped down from the board of the Swire Group in June 1998. In London, he was also appointed chairman of the [[British Tourist Authority]] and the [[English Tourist Board]]. Bluck was announced by Minister of State for Trade and Industry [[Norman Lamont]] as "a tough businessman able to… achieve the economies we want".&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; His attempt to bring the Scottish and Welsh Tourist Boards together met strong opposition, but he was an effective spokesman when the Americans stayed away from Britain in mid 1986 after the [[Second Thatcher ministry|Thatcher government]] supported the US bombing of Libya. He was reappointed until 1990, and was praised by another minister as "a breath of fresh air, bringing a Hong Kong can-do attitude to a rather sleepy industry".&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; For his services hew was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1990.&lt;ref name="swire"/&gt;

Residing in Kent, he became the chairman of the Kent Economic Development Board, a member of the Court of the [[University of Kent|Kent University]], and a governor of [[Marlborough House School]] at Hawkhurst.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Bluck was a keen yachtsman, regularly competing in Hong Kong-Macau races during his residence in Hong Kong. he had also sailed in Yokohama Bay until he was arrested by US coastguards. He settled in Kent after he returned to England.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; In later years he had a house in the South of France, where he sailed his last yacht, Stella Maris.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

He married Stella Murdoch in 1952, whom he met at the Hong Kong Yacht Club when he leapt through a window into the ballroom costumed as a pirate.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; The couple had one son and three daughters, Penny, Beth, Ali and Michael. He was also chairman and president of the [[Cystic Fibrosis Trust]], as his eldest granddaughter having been afflicted with the condition.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

Bluck died on 6 October 2015 at the age of 88 after a long illness.&lt;ref name="swire"/&gt;

{{Capitalism |Ideologies}}
'''Eco-capitalism''', also known as '''environmental capitalism''' or '''green capitalism''', is the view that [[capital (economics)|capital]] exists in nature as "[[natural capital]]" ([[ecosystem]]s that have [[ecological yield]]) on which all [[wealth]] depends, and therefore, [[Market (economics)|market-based]] government policy instruments (such as a [[carbon tax]]) should be used to resolve environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Eco-Capitalism|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/eco-capitalism|website=collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "'''Blue Greens'''" is often applied to those who espouse eco-capitalism. It is considered as the right-wing equivalent to [[Eco-socialism|Red Greens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The rise of green capitalism|url=http://roadtoparis.info/top-list/rise-green-capitalism/|website=roadtoparis.info|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The roots of eco-capitalism can be traced back to the late 1960s. The "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]", an essay published in 1968 in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' by [[Garrett Hardin]], claimed the inevitability of [[malthusian catastrophe]] due to liberal or democratic government's policies to leave family size matters to the family, and enabling the welfare state to willingly care for potential [[human overpopulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardin|first=Garrett|date=1968-12-13|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/162/3859/1243|journal=Science|language=en|volume=162|issue=3859|pages=1243–1248|doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17756331|bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardin argued that if families were given freedom of choice in the matter, but were removed from a welfare state, parents choosing to overbear would not have the resources to provide for their "litter", thus solving the problem of overpopulation. This represents an early argument made from an eco-capitalist standpoint: overpopulation would technically be solved by a free market. [[John Baden]], a collaborator with Garrett Hardin on other works including ''Managing the Commons,'' founded the Political Economy Research Center (now called the [[Property and Environment Research Center]] ) in 1982. As one of the first eco-capitalist organizations created, PERC's ongoing mission is "improving environmental quality through property rights and markets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perc.org/about-perc/percs-mission-vision|title=PERC's Mission &amp; Vision {{!}} PERC – The Property and Environment Research Center|website=www.perc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303130554/http://www.perc.org/about-perc/percs-mission-vision|archive-date=2017-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular eco-capitalist idea was [[emissions trading]], or more commonly, cap and trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/air/the-political-history-of-cap-and-trade-34711212/|title=The Political History of Cap and Trade|last=Conniff|first=Richard|date=August 2009|website=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emissions trading, a market-based approach that allows polluting entities to purchase or be allocated permits, began being researched in the late 1960s. International emissions trading was significantly popularized in the 1990s when the [[United Nations]] adopted the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/~danov20d/site/history.htm|title=The Kyoto Protocol :: History|website=www.mtholyoke.edu|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eco-capitalist theorists==
*[[Terry L. Anderson]] is a graduate of the University of Montana, and received his Ph.D from Washington University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perc.org/staff/terry-anderson|title=Terry Anderson {{!}} PERC – The Property and Environment Research Center|website=www.perc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson is currently serving as the co-chair of the Hoover Institution's Property Rights, Freedom and Prosperity task force. Anderson advocates that free markets can be both economically beneficial and environmentally protective. Anderson specializes in how markets impact Native American communities and their economies.
*[[Bruce Yandle]], a graduate of Mercer University, attended Georgia State University where he earned a MBA and PhD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercatus.org/bruce-yandle|title=Bruce Yandle|date=2008-08-15|work=Mercatus Center|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yandle is currently serving as dean emeritus of Clemson University's college of business. Yandle is prominent in the field of eco-capitalism for his story of the "Bootlegger and the Baptist". Yandle's theory of the Bootlegger and the Baptist posits that ethical groups, religious institutions and business captains can align their organizations in the interest of regulation and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Yandle]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry L.

*[[Paul Hawken]] decided at a young age to dedicate his life to making business eco-friendlier. Hawken's is the architect of the United States first natural foods company, Erewhon Trading Company where all products were organically composed. Hawken's continued to make an impact on the business world by founding the research organization, Natural Capital Institute, and developed, [[Wiser.org|Wiser Earth]], a program focused on providing a platform for all to communicate about the environment. Not only has Paul Hawken set a good example for how to transform economy into eco-capitalism, but also has authored hundreds of publications, including four best selling books.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulhawken.com|title=paul hawken|website=www.paulhawken.com|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his writings, Hawken stresses that many smart ecological options are out there for businesses that will help save the environment, while also continuing to bring [[economic profit]]. One idea discussed in his book, ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution'', is the possibility of developing lightweight, electricity-powered cars as an alternative to our current transportation issue. Hawken attributes the hesitancy of adopting these options to lack of knowledge of these alternatives and high initial costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution|last=Hawken|first=Paul,|last2=Lovins|first2=Amory|last3=Lovins|first3=Hunter|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Hawken is now the head of OneSun, Inc., an energy corporation concentrated on low-cost solar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*[[Lester R. Brown|Lester Brown]] began his career as a tomato farmer in New Jersey, until earning his degree at Rutgers University and traveling to a rural India for a six-month study of the country's food and population crisis. From this point on, Brown's focus was mostly on finding alternatives that would solve the world’s population and resources problem. With financial support from [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]], Brown created the [[Worldwatch Institute]], the first dedicated to researching global environmental problems. In 2001, Brown found the [[Earth Policy Institute]], an organization that outlined a vision for creating an environmentally sustainable economy. Over the course of his career, Lester Brown has authored over 50 books and received 25 honorary degrees.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earth-policy.org/|title=Earth Policy Institute – Building a Sustainable Future {{!}} Home|website=www.earth-policy.org|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his publications, Brown discusses how the key to an eco-friendly economy is an honest market and replacing harmful aspects of the environment, like fossil fuels with renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/lester-brown|title=An interview with Lester Brown »  American Scientist|website=www.americanscientist.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2015, Lester Brown retired from Earth Policy and closed the institute.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Transition to eco-capitalism==
The ideology of eco-capitalism was adopted to satisfy two competing needs:
#the desire for generating profit by businesses in a capitalist society and
#the urgency for proper actions to address a struggling environment negatively impacted by human activity.
Under the doctrine of eco-capitalism, businesses commodify the act of addressing environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prothero|first1=Andrea|last2=Fitchett|first2=James|title=Greening Capitalism: Opportunities for a Green Commodity|journal=Journal of Macromarketing|date=June 2000|volume=20|issue=1|pages=46–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="god"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Richard|title=Green Capitalism: the god that failed|date=2015|publisher=World Economics Association|isbn=978-1-911156-22-2|pages=55–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are common principles in the transition to eco-capitalism.

=== Externalities: Correcting of a free market failure ===

A central part of eco-capitalism is to correct for the [[market failure]] seen in the externalization of [[pollution]]. By treating the issue of pollution as an [[externality]] it has allowed the market to minimize the degree of accountability. To correct for this market failure eco-capitalism would have to internalize this cost. A prime example of this shift towards internalizing externalities is seen in the adoption of a system for [[carbon trading]]. In a system like this people are forced to factor the pollution cost into their expenses.&lt;ref name=Zenghelis2015&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-923X.12239 |title=10. Decarbonisation: Innovation and the Economics of Climate Change |journal=The Political Quarterly |volume=86 |issue=S1 |pages=172–90 |year=2015 |last1=Zenghelis |first1=Dimitri }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system as well as other systems of internalization function on large and small scales(often times both are tightly connected). On a corporate scale, the government can regulate [[carbon emissions]] and other polluting factors in business practices forcing companies to either reduce their pollution levels, externalize these costs onto their consumers by raising the cost of their goods/services, and/or a combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1674446 |title=Pollution Externalities in a Schumpeterian Growth Model |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |year=2010 |last1=Koesler |first1=Simon }}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of systems can also be effective in indirectly creating a more environmentally conscious consumer base. As the companies who are creating the most pollution face falling profit levels and rising prices their consumers and investors are inclined to take their business elsewhere. This migration of investment and revenue would then be expected to make its way to business who have already incorporated the minimization of pollution into their business model thus allowing them to provide lower prices and higher profit margins attracting the migrating consumers and investors.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

===Green consumption===
{{further|Green consumption}}
At the conception of the ideology, major theorists of eco-capitalism, Paul Hawken, Lester Brown, and Francis Cairncross, saw an opportunity to establish a different approach to environmentalism in a capitalist society.&lt;ref name="god"/&gt; These theorists thought that not only producers but also consumers could shoulder the social responsibility of environmental restoration if "green technology, green taxes, green labeling, and eco-conscious shopping" existed.&lt;ref name="god"/&gt; The resulting "shopping our way to sustainability" mentality encouraged the development of organic farming, renewable energy, green certifications as well as other eco-friendly practices.&lt;ref name="god"/&gt;

A 2015 report from Nielsen lends credence to this theory. According to the report, consumers have more brand loyalty and are willing to pay higher prices for a product that is perceived as being sustainable. This is especially true among Millenials and Generation Z.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2015/green-generation-millennials-say-sustainability-is-a-shopping-priority.html|title=Green Generation: Millennials Say Sustainability Is a Shopping Priority|website=www.nielsen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These generations currently make up 48% of the global marketplace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2017/the-nielsen-total-audience-report-q1-2017.html|title=The Nielsen Total Audience Report: Q1 2017|website=www.nielsen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and still haven't hit their peak spending levels. As these generations' preferences continue to shape how businesses operate and market themselves, they could drive a continued shift toward green consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesinsights/2017/09/26/millennials-and-gen-z-are-the-new-bosses-of-the-boardroom/#7e3e1e7e67f4|title=Millennials And Gen Z Are The New Bosses Of The Boardroom|first=Stuart R.|last=Levine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the Annual Review of Environmental Resources, "the focus of policy makers, businesses, and researchers has mostly been on the latter (consuming differently), with relatively little attention paid to consuming less".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-032609-094328 |title=Green Consumption: Behavior and Norms |journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources |volume=35 |page=195 |year=2010 |last1=Peattie |first1=Ken }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of how to encourage sustainable consumption from the University of Surrey shows that, "Government policies send important signals to consumers about institutional goals
and national priorities."&lt;ref name="sustainablelifestyles.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainablelifestyles.ac.uk/sites/default/files/motivating_sc_final.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Motivating SC final.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments can pull a variety of levers to signal this including product, trading, building, media, and marketing standards.&lt;ref name="sustainablelifestyles.ac.uk"/&gt;

===Carbon trading===
{{further|Carbon trading}}
Creating perhaps the first major eco-capitalist endorsement, many political and economic institutions support a system of pollution credits. Such a system, which assigns property rights to emissions, is considered to be the most "efficient and effective" way for regulating [[greenhouse gas emissions]] in the current [[neoliberal]] global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bailey |first1=Ian |title=Neoliberalism, climate governance and the scalar politics of EU emissions trading |journal=Royal Geographical Society |date=2007 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=431–42 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4762.2007.00770.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the case of tradable pollution credits, the resulting market-based system of emissions regulation is believed to motivate businesses to invest in technology that reduce greenhouse gas emissions using [[positive reinforcement]] (i.e. ability to trade unused credits) and [[punishment]] (i.e. the need to buy more credits).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prudham |first1=Scott |title=Pimping climate change: Richard Branson, global warming, and the performance of green capitalism |journal=Environment and Planning |date=2009 |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=1594–613 |doi=10.1068/a4071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Full cost accounting===
[[Environmental full-cost accounting]] explains corporate actions on the basis of the triple bottom line, which is best summarized as "people, planet, and profit". As a concept of corporate social responsibility, full cost accounting not only considers social and economic costs and benefits but also the environmental implications of specific corporate actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffiths|first1=M.R|last2=Lucas|first2=J.R.|title=Value economics: the ethical implications of value for new economic thinking|date=November 16, 2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-137-54186-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Full Cost Accounting.jpg|thumb|A breakdown of accounting methodologies by what they include.]]

While there has been progress in measuring the cost of harm to the health of individuals and the environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/how-to-measure-the-environmental|title=How to measure environmental pressures from production and consumption?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the interaction of environmental, social, and health effects makes measurement difficult. Measurement attempts can be broadly categorized as either behavioral in nature, like [[hedonic pricing]], or dose-response which looks at indirect effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.06.040 |title=A comprehensive review of full cost accounting methods and their applicability to the automotive industry |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=108 |page=1123 |year=2015 |last1=Jasinski |first1=Dominik |last2=Meredith |first2=James |last3=Kirwan |first3=Kerry }}&lt;/ref&gt; A standardized measurement of these costs has yet to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/nr/sustainability/full-cost-accounting/en/|title=Sustainability Pathways: Full-cost accounting|website=www.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This should not be confused with the full-cost method used by organizations searching for oil and gas that "does not differentiate between operating expenses associated with successful and unsuccessful exploration projects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/full-cost-method.asp|title=Full-Cost Method|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=14 May 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genuine progress indicator===
The current standard of using the gross domestic product (GDP) as an indicator of welfare is criticized for being inaccurate. An alternative to GDP, the [[genuine progress indicator]] compensates for the shortcomings of the GDP as a welfare indicator by accounting for environmental harms as well as other factors that affect consumption, such as crime and income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Talberth |first1=John |last2=Cobb |first2=Clifford |last3=Slattery |first3=Noah |title=The Genuine Progress Indicator 2006: A Tool for Sustainable Development |journal=Redefining Progress |date=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Majority of the criticism from traditionally unregulated [[capitalism]] is due to eco-capitalism's increased regulation. Pollution credits (as a means for regulating greenhouse gas emissions) is traditionally at odds with economically conservative ideologies. Elements of unregulated capitalism prefer environmental issues to be addressed by individuals who may allocate their own income and wealth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meltzher |first=Alan H. |year= |title=Why Capitalism?|url=http://wpweb2.tepper.cmu.edu/facultyadmin/upload/url4_933269885961_why_capitalism.pdf |journal=Carnegie Mellon University and American Enterprise Institute |volume= |page=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305224131/http://wpweb2.tepper.cmu.edu/facultyadmin/upload/url4_933269885961_Why_Capitalism.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; oppose the [[commodification]] of by-products like carbon emissions, and emphasize positive incentives to maintain resources through free-market competition and entrepreneurship.

Proponents of eco-capitalism view environmental reform like pollution credits as a more transformative and progressive system. According to these Proponents, since free market capitalism as inherently expansionist in tendency, ignoring environmental responsibility is a danger to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/26/capitalism-environment-green-greed-slow-life-symposium-tony-juniper|title=Capitalism v environment: can greed ever be green?|website=theguardian.com|last1=Juniper|first1=Tony|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 36% of Americans are deeply concerned about climate issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/10/04/the-politics-of-climate/|title=The Politics of Climate|date=4 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents of Eco Capitalism typically favor political [[environmentalism]], which emphasizes negative incentives like regulation and taxes to encourage the conservation of resources and prevent environmental harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newpol.org/content/myths-%E2%80%9Cgreen-capitalism%E2%80%9D |title=The Myths of 'Green Capitalism' |first=Brian |last=Tokar |date=Winter 2014 |access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political theorist, [[Antonio Gramsci]], cites theories of [[common sense]], which suggests that, in general, free market capitalism absent of environmental reform, is ingrained in the minds of its members as the only viable and successful form of economic organization through [[cultural hegemony]]. Therefore, the proposal of any alternate economic system, like eco-capitalism, must overcome the predominant common sense and economic status quo in order to develop opposing theories. Nonetheless, movements in the United States and abroad have continued to push for reforms to protect the environment in current capitalistic systems.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Another political theorist, Daniel Tanuro, explains, in his book "Green Capitalism: Why it Can't Work", that for green capitalism to be successful, it would have to replace current mainstream capitalism with Eco-socialist methods, while defying corporate interests:
* “If by ‘green capitalism’ we understand a system in which the qualitative, social and ecological parameters are taken in account by the numerous competing capitals, that is to say even within economic activity as an endogenous mechanism, then we are completely deluded. In fact, we would be talking about a form of capitalism in which the law of value was no longer in operation, which is a contradiction in terms”(112)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Green Capitalism: Why it Can't Work|last=Tanuro|first=Daniel|publisher=Merlin Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-55266-668-5|location=|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Tanuro adds that social and economical change to the current capitalist systems is necessary, because technology will invariably increase emissions as manufacturing processes and distribution systems progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Green Capitalism: Why it Can't Work|last=Tanuro|first=Daniel|publisher=Merlin Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-55266-668-5|location=|pages=}}{{pn|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanuro argues for changes in three areas: 
# Use of transportation methods
# [[Agriculture]] and dietary changes
# Overall [[consumer]] lifestyle and market spending
Despite this argument, critics still claim that green consumption, sustainable behavior on the part of the consumer, is not enough to be instituted as a socio-environmental solution. In accordance with [[hegemony]], capitalism agrees that the government has little control over market and buyers, sellers, and consumers ultimately drive the market. In contrast, in green capitalism, the government would have more control therefore; consumers do not have direct power over the market, and should not be held accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S1414-49802012000100010 |title='Consumo consciente': O ecocapitalismo como ideologia |trans-title='Conscious Consumption': Ecocapitalism as Ideology |language=pt |journal=Revista Katálysis |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=95–111 |year=2012 |last1=Silva |first1=Maria das Graças e |last2=Araújo |first2=Nailsa Maria Souza |last3=Santos |first3=Josiane Soares }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, going against the established monetary system of capitalism in the U.S. and spread throughout the globally.

Environmental Scholar Bill McKibben proposes "full scale climate mobilization" to address environmental decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/135684/declare-war-climate-change-mobilize-wwii|title=We Need to Literally Declare War on Climate Change|date=2016-08-15|website=New Republic|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, vehicle manufacturers and general goods manufacturers shifted to producing weapons, military vehicles and war time goods. McKibben argues that, to combat environmental change, the American Military Industrial Complex and other national arms producers could shift to producing solar panels, wind turbines and other environmental products in an Eco-Capitalist system.

Scholar Elliot Sperber counters McKibben's argument, citing that industrial environmental mobilization favoring eco-capitalism would exacerbate socioeconomic stratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/08/22/clean-green-class-war-bill-mckibbens-shortsighted-war-on-climate-change/|title=Clean, Green, Class War: Bill McKibben’s Shortsighted ‘War on Climate Change’|date=2016-08-22|website=www.counterpunch.org|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sperber counters the notion that "full scale climate mobilization" and the production it implies is the best immediate solution for addressing climate change. Because Eco Capitalism is still capitalistic, it relies on production of goods. Sperber argues for the production of fewer goods (i.e. fewer plastics, fewer vehicles) to minimize carbon footprints.

Apparent criticisms have risen concerns and need for social and economical transformation on both ends of the political and theoretical divide. Nonetheless, they have shaped the way the majority public has viewed and contributed to capitalism and continue to both actively change the innate structure of the economic system and enhance it for further economic stability.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

== Appeal of renewable energy in the capitalist market ==
Tom Randall, a correspondent specializing in renewable energy for Bloomberg, calls to attention that wind and solar (energy sources) are "outperforming" [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-06/wind-and-solar-are-crushing-fossil-fuels|title=Wind and Solar Are Crushing Fossil Fuels|date=2016-04-06|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of investments, clean energy outperforms both gas and coal by a 2-1 margin. This positive margin may be attributed to the consistently falling price of renewable energy production. [[Renewable energy|Renewable energy sources]] hold assertive advantages over fossil fuels because they exist as technologies, not fuels. As time proceeds, renewable energy becomes inevitably more efficient as technology adapts. Technologies for extracting fuels may change, but the fuels remain as constants. Both the solar and wind industries have proven growth over time: Over the last 15 years, the solar industry has doubled seven times and the wind industry has doubled four times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In contrast, the fossil fuel industry has declined over the last 15 years. America's coal industry has lost 75 percent of its value within the past few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontracker.org/fossil-fuels-are-dead-the-rest-is-just-detail/|title=Fossil fuels are dead – the rest is just detail|website=www.carbontracker.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy sources also gain advantages over the fossil fuel industry through [[Paris Agreement|international governmental support]]. Globally, governments implement subsidies to boost the [[renewable energy industry]]. Concurrently, various global efforts fight against fossil fuel production and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnsjournal.org/green-capitalism-builds-big-solar-should-we-throw-the-baby-out-with-the-bathwater/|title="Green" Capitalism builds Big Solar: Should we throw the baby out with the bathwater?|date=2016-04-10|work=CNS web|access-date=2017-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for renewable energy sources has skyrocketed in the last 15 years, while fossil fuels have drastically fallen in demand (in capitalist societies).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-06/wind-and-solar-are-crushing-fossil-fuels|title=Wind and Solar Are Crushing Fossil Fuels|date=2016-04-06|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The worldwide concern of [[climate change]] (also known as [[global warming]]) is notably the largest contributor to the [[Sustainable energy|green energy]] industry's rapid acceleration, just as it is largely responsible for the decline of the [[fossil fuel industry]]. The overwhelming scientific consensus of climate change's reality and its potential catastrophic effects have caused a large part of the world's population to respond with panic and immediate action. While the world's response has been strong, environmentalists and climate scientists do not believe the response has been strong enough to counter climate change's effects, and that the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is moving far too slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnsjournal.org/green-capitalism-builds-big-solar-should-we-throw-the-baby-out-with-the-bathwater/|title="Green" Capitalism builds Big Solar: Should we throw the baby out with the bathwater?|date=2016-04-10|work=CNS web|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global efforts and concerns of both governments and individuals to take action regarding implementing and transforming a society's energy sources from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources show the enormous potential of the green energy market. This potential is seen in the countless renewable energy projects under way. Currently, there are over [https://web.archive.org/web/20170301182310/http://www.seia.org/sites/default/files/resources/MajorProjectsList_20160914_0.pdf 4,000 major solar projects] being implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seia.org/research-resources/major-solar-projects-list|title=Major Solar Projects List|website=SEIA|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These, and all renewable energy projects, set goals of long-term economic benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-energy/renewable-energy/public-benefits-of-renewable-power#.WLX9nxC2CuV|title=Benefits of Renewable Energy Use|work=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Global Apollo Programme]], set up by both economists and scientists, has a goal of creating a solar capability that can stand as a cheaper alternative to coal-fueled power plants by 2025.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/06/economist-explains-1|title=How renewable energy can become competitive|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Capitalism|capitalist markets]], solar energy has the very real potential of becoming a direct competitor to coal plants in less than a decade.

=== Barriers to transition ===

While there can be many barriers to the transition to a eco-capitalist system, one of the most daunting and forgotten is the systemic barrier that can be created by former models. Dimitri Zenghelis explores the idea of path dependence and the how continuing to build infrastructure without foresight seriously impedes the implementation and benefits of future innovations.&lt;ref name=Zenghelis2015/&gt; Zenghelis uses the term “locked-in” to describe situations where the full implementation of a new innovation cannot be seen because an earlier infrastructure prevents it from functioning well. This barrier is exemplified in older cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York where the infrastructure was designed around urban sprawl to accommodate private vehicles. The sprawl has been researched with the results returning that the moving forward mega-cities need to be constructed as eco-cities if the hope of curving emission levels down is going to have any hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2013.09.003 |title=Incentives for China's urban mayors to mitigate pollution externalities: The role of the central government and public environmentalism |journal=Regional Science and Urban Economics |volume=47 |page=61 |year=2014 |last1=Zheng |first1=Siqi |last2=Kahn |first2=Matthew E |last3=Sun |first3=Weizeng |last4=Luo |first4=Danglun }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generational history==
[[File:John Fairfax.jpg|thumb|[[John Fairfax]], ''[[circa|ca.]]'' 1861]]

===First generation===
{{main|John Fairfax}}
'''John Fairfax''' was born in Barford, Warwickshire, the second son of William Fairfax and his wife, Elizabeth ''[[née]]'' Jesson. In 1817, John Fairfax was apprenticed to William Perry, a bookseller and printer in Warwick. In 1825, Fairfax went to London where he worked as a compositor in a general printing office and on the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]''. A year or two later he established himself at [[Leamington Hastings]] as a printer, bookseller and stationer. There, on 31 July 1827, he married Sarah Reading, daughter of James and Sarah Reading. He became the printer of the ''Leamington Spa Courier'', and in 1835 he purchased an interest in another paper ''The Leamington Chronicle and Warwickshire Reporter''. He had a book binding business in Leamington.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; In 1836, Fairfax published a letter criticizing the conduct of a local solicitor, who brought an action against him. Though judgment was given for the defendant, the solicitor appealed. Judgment was again given for Fairfax but the costs of the actions were so heavy that he had to apply to the Insolvency Court. There was sympathy for him, his friends offered assistance but he decided to make a fresh start in a new land, and in May 1838 sailed for the [[New South Wales#History|Colony of New South Wales]] in the ''Lady Fitzherbert'' with his wife and three children, his mother and a brother-in-law. After a voyage of about 130 days, they reached [[Sydney]] on 26 September 1838; Fairfax had just £5 in his pocket.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=dab&gt;{{Dictionary of Australian Biography|First=John|Last=Fairfax |shortlink=0-dict-biogF.html#fairfax1 |accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairfax worked as a [[Typesetting|compositor]] for some months then on 1 April 1839 was appointed librarian of the Australian subscription library. The salary was only £100 a year but he had free quarters for his family in pleasant surroundings. He found he was able to get some typesetting, and he also contributed articles to the various Sydney newspapers. What was possibly more important was his contacting through the library the best educated men of Sydney, and he became friendly with some of them. One of these was a member of the staff of the ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Herald]]'', Charles Kemp, with whom he joined forces to purchase the ''Herald'' for the sum of £10,000.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

The paper was bought on terms, friends helped the two men to find the deposit, and on 8 February 1841 they took control as proprietors. It was good combination for each had qualities that supplemented the other's, they worked in harmony for 12 years and firmly established the paper as the leading Australian newspaper of the day. It was given the fuller title of the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' in 1842, and in spite of a period of depression both partners by 1853 were in prosperous positions. Kemp then decided to retire. The partnership was dissolved in September 1853 and Charles, John's eldest son, became a partner. In the previous year his father had visited England and seeking out his old creditors repaid every man in full with interest added. Under Fairfax and his sons the paper continually increased in public favour, and the great increase of population in the 1850s added much to its prosperity. It was always conservative; G. B. Barton in his ''Literature in New South Wales'' said in 1866 that its Toryism had "increased in a direct ratio to the Radicalism of the constitution, and its prosperity in a direct ratio to its Toryism". But this is an overstatement. ''The Herald'' was moved to its present site in 1856, and at that date claimed to have the largest circulation in the "colonial empire". A weekly journal, ''[[The Sydney Mail]]'', was established, its first number was published on 7 July 1860, and it continued to appear until 1938.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

In 1851 John Fairfax was a foundation director of the [[Australian Mutual Provident Society]], and in the 1860s a director of the Sydney Insurance Co., the New South Wales Marine Insurance Co., the [[Australian Joint Stock Bank]] and [[Australian Gas Light Company|The Australian Gaslight Co.]] and a trustee of the Savings Bank of New South Wales.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; In his latter years, Fairfax served as a member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] from 1874 until his death in 1877, but never took an active part in politics.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

Fairfax and his wife, Sarah, ''née'' Reading, had four children, Emily, Charles John, James Reading and Edward Ross.

&lt;!-- The image is consistent with what the powerplant itself (http://www.gres2.kz/index.php?view=3&amp;in=gallery&amp;id=15#) claims to be the GRES-2 stack --&gt;]]
A '''flue-gas stack''' is a type of [[chimney]], a vertical pipe, channel or similar structure through which combustion product gases called [[flue gas]]es are exhausted to the outside air. Flue gases are produced when coal, oil, natural gas, wood or any other fuel is [[combustion|combusted]] in an industrial furnace, a [[power station|power plant's]] steam-generating boiler, or other large combustion device. Flue gas is usually composed of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water vapor as well as [[nitrogen]] and excess [[oxygen]] remaining from the intake combustion air. It also contains a small percentage of pollutants such as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]] and [[sulfur oxides]]. The flue gas stacks are often quite tall, up to 400 metres (1300&amp;nbsp;feet) or more, so as to disperse the exhaust pollutants over a greater area and thereby reduce the [[concentration]] of the pollutants to the levels required by governmental environmental policy and environmental regulation.

When the flue gases are exhausted from stoves, ovens, fireplaces, or other small sources within residential abodes, restaurants, hotels, or other public buildings and small commercial enterprises, their flue gas stacks are referred to as chimneys.

==History==

The first industrial chimneys were built in the mid-17th century when it was first understood how they could improve the combustion of a furnace by increasing the [[Stack effect#The flow induced by the stack effect|draft]] of air into the combustion zone.&lt;ref&gt;Douet, James (1988). ''Going up in Smoke:The History of the Industrial Chimney'', Victorian Society, London, England.  [http://www.victoriansociety.org.uk/caserpts.html Victorian Society Casework Reports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925221950/http://www.victoriansociety.org.uk/caserpts.html |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they played an important part in the development of [[reverberatory furnace]]s and a coal-based metallurgical industry, one of the key sectors of the early [[Industrial Revolution]]. Most 18th-century industrial chimneys (now commonly referred to as '''flue gas stacks''') were built into the walls of the furnace much like a domestic chimney. The first free-standing industrial chimneys were probably those erected at the end of the long condensing [[flue]]s associated with smelting [[lead]].

The powerful association between industrial chimneys and the characteristic smoke-filled landscapes of the industrial revolution was due to the universal application of the [[steam engine]] for most manufacturing processes. The chimney is part of a steam-generating boiler, and its evolution is closely linked to increases in the power of the steam engine. The chimneys of [[Thomas Newcomen]]’s steam engine were incorporated into the walls of the engine house. The taller, free-standing industrial chimneys that appeared in the early 19th century were related to the changes in boiler design associated with [[James Watt]]’s "double-powered" engines, and they continued to grow in stature throughout the Victorian period. Decorative embellishments are a feature of many industrial chimneys  from the 1860s, with over-sailing caps and patterned brickwork.

The invention of fan-assisted forced draft in the early 20th century removed the industrial chimney's original function, that of drawing air into the steam-generating boilers or other furnaces. With the replacement of the steam engine as a prime mover, first by diesel engines and then by electric motors, the  early industrial chimneys began to disappear from the industrial landscape. Building materials changed from stone and brick to steel and later reinforced concrete, and the height of the industrial chimney was determined by the need to disperse combustion flue gases to comply with governmental [[air pollution]] control regulations.

==Flue-gas stack draft==
[[Image:Chimney effect.svg|thumb|180px|right|The stack effect in chimneys: the gauges represent absolute air pressure and the airflow is indicated with light grey arrows. The gauge dials move clockwise with increasing pressure.]]
{{main|Stack effect}}

The combustion flue gases inside the flue gas stacks are much hotter than the ambient outside air and therefore less dense than the ambient air. That causes the bottom of the vertical column of hot flue gas to have a lower pressure than the pressure at the bottom of a corresponding column of outside air. That higher pressure outside the chimney is the driving force that moves the required combustion air into the combustion zone and also moves the flue gas up and out of the chimney.  That movement or flow of combustion air and flue gas is called "natural draft", [[HVAC#Natural ventilation|"natural ventilation"]], "chimney effect", or "[[stack effect]]". The taller the stack, the more draft is created.

The equation below provides an approximation of the pressure difference, Δ''P'', (between the bottom and the top of the flue gas stack) that is created by the draft:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch.hku.hk/teaching/lectures/airvent/sect02.htm Natural Ventilation Lecture 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512181617/http://www.arch.hku.hk/teaching/lectures/airvent/sect02.htm |date=2006-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Perry, R.H.  |author2=Green, Don W.|title=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook|edition=6th Edition (page 9-72)|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company|year=1984|isbn=0-07-049479-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta P =Cah\bigg(\frac {1}{T_o} - \frac {1}{T_i}\bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* Δ''P'': available pressure difference, in [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]
* ''C'' = 0.0342
* ''a'': atmospheric pressure, in Pa
* ''h'': height of the flue gas stack, in m
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'': absolute outside air temperature, in [[kelvin|K]]
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'': absolute average temperature of the flue gas inside the stack, in K.

The above equation is an approximation because it assumes that the [[molar mass]] of the flue gas and the outside air are equal and that the pressure drop through the flue gas stack is quite small.  Both assumptions are fairly good but not exactly accurate.

== Flue-gas flow-rate induced by the draft==

As a "first guess" approximation, the following equation can be used to estimate the flue-gas flow-rate induced by the draft of a flue-gas stack. The equation assumes that the molar mass of the flue gas and the outside air are equal and that the [[friction|frictional resistance]] and heat losses are negligible:.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch.hku.hk/teaching/lectures/airvent/sect03.htm Natural Ventilation Lecture 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702065714/http://www.arch.hku.hk/teaching/lectures/airvent/sect03.htm |date=2006-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q = CA\sqrt {2gH\frac{T_i - T_o}{T_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''Q'': flue-gas flow-rate, m³/s  
* ''A'': cross-sectional area of chimney, m² (assuming it has a constant cross-section)  
* ''C'' : discharge coefficient (usually taken to be 0.65–0.70)
* ''g'': [[standard gravity|gravitational acceleration at sea level]] = 9.807&amp;nbsp;m/s² 
* ''H'' : height of chimney, m 
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : absolute average temperature of the flue gas in the stack, [[kelvin|K]]
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' : absolute outside air temperature, K

Also, this equation is only valid when the resistance to the draft flow is caused by a single orifice characterized by the discharge coefficient C. In many, if not most situations, the resistance is primarily imposed by the flue stack itself. In these cases, the resistance is proportional to the stack height H. This causes a cancellation of the H in the above equation predicting Q to be invariant with respect to the flue height.

Designing chimneys and stacks to provide the correct amount of natural draft involves a great many factors such as:

* The height and diameter of the stack.
* The desired amount of excess combustion air needed to assure complete combustion.
* The temperature of the flue gases leaving the combustion zone.
* The composition of the combustion flue gas, which determines the flue-gas density.
* The frictional resistance to the flow of the flue gases through the chimney or stack, which will vary with the materials used to construct the chimney or stack.
* The heat loss from the flue gases as they flow through the chimney or stack.
* The local atmospheric pressure of the ambient air, which is determined by the local elevation above sea level.

The calculation of many of the above design factors requires trial-and-error reiterative methods.

Government agencies in most countries have specific codes which govern how such design calculations must be performed. Many non-governmental organizations also have codes governing the design of chimneys and stacks (notably, the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] codes).

==Stack design==
The design of large stacks poses considerable engineering challenges.  [[Vortex shedding]] in high winds can cause dangerous [[oscillations]] in the stack, and may lead to its collapse.  The use of helical faring is common to prevent this process occurring at or close to the [[resonant frequency]] of the stack.

==Other items of interest==

Some fuel-burning industrial equipment does not rely upon natural draft.  Many such equipment items use large fans or blowers to accomplish the same objectives, namely: the flow of combustion air into the combustion chamber and the flow of the hot flue gas out of the chimney or stack.

A great many power plants are equipped with facilities for the removal of [[sulfur dioxide]] (i.e., [[flue-gas desulfurization]]), [[nitrogen oxides]] (i.e., [[selective catalytic reduction]], [[exhaust gas recirculation]], thermal deNOx, or low NOx burners) and particulate matter (i.e., [[electrostatic precipitator]])s. At such power plants, it is possible to use a [[cooling tower]] as a flue gas stack. Examples can be seen in Germany at the [[Power Station Staudinger Grosskrotzenburg]] and at the [[Rostock Power Station]]. Power plants without flue gas purification, would experience serious corrosion in such stacks.

In the United States and a number of other countries, [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]&lt;/ref&gt; studies are required to determine the flue gas stack height needed to comply with the local [[air pollution]] regulations. The United States also limits the maximum height of a flue gas stack to what is known as the "Good Engineering Practice (GEP)" stack height.&lt;ref&gt;''Guideline for Determination of Good Engineering Practice Stack Height (Technical Support Document for the Stack Height Regulations), Revised'' (1985), EPA Publication No. EPA–450/4–80–023R, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (NTIS No. PB 85–225241)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Jr., R.E. and W.H. Snyder (1983). ''Determination of Good Engineering Practice Stack Height: A Demonstration Study for a Power Plant'', EPA Publication No. EPA–600/3–83–024. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (NTIS No. PB 83–207407)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of existing flue gas stacks that exceed the GEP stack height, any air pollution dispersion modelling studies for such stacks must use the GEP stack height rather than the actual stack height.

Endress''' (9 January 1924, in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], Germany &amp;ndash; 14 December 2008, in [[Arlesheim]], Switzerland) was a German-Swiss entrepreneur in the area of measurement and control technology, and founder of the company [[Endress+Hauser]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endress.com/de/search?filter.text=georg h. endress Georg H. Endress on The Webpage of E+H]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maschinenmarkt.vogel.de/index.cfm?pid=5112&amp;pk=160193&amp;print=true&amp;printtype=article Industry Portal: Company Founder Georg Endress dies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Georg Endress was born the son of a factory director. As a young man he moved to [[Zagreb]] with his family, where he went to school. He attended further schools in [[Basle]] (Switzerland) where he passed school-leaving exams, and then took an apprenticeship as a mechanic, after which he studied engineering in [[Zuerich]].

He worked for several Swiss companies, and one English firm, before founding a sales company for level measuring devices in [[Loerrach]] in 1953 together with  the banker Ludwig Hauser, which later became Endress+Hauser AG. The firm began producing its own instruments in 1956. After achieving success in Europe subsidiaries were opened in the USA and Japan (1970) and China (1980). In 1995 Georg Endress handed over control of the firm to his son Klaus Endress.

Georg Endress felt a particular responsibility towards the Dreiländereck (“three-country-corner”) where Germany, France and Switzerland meet, where he wanted, as he himself said, to remove psychological national barriers. He initiated Tri-Nation Apprentice and Engineering education opportunities in the upper Rhine area, promoted international courses at the [[Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University Loerrach|University Loerrach]]. The tri-nation [[BioValley (Europe)|BioValley-Organisation]] was formed on his initiative.

In addition, he was involved in Baden Trade Organisation (WVIB, Wirtschaftsverband industrieller Unternehmen Baden) and the Regional Trade Association Black Forest and Upper Rhine.  (Regio-Gesellschaft Schwarzwald-Oberrhein)

He married Alice Vogt in 1946; of their eight children five were active in Endress+Hauser AG at the end of 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8457">[[File:Salicornia europaea MS 0802.JPG|thumb|right|300px|''[[Salicornia]] europaea'' (common  glasswort).]]

The '''glassworts''' are various succulent, annual [[halophytes]] plants, that is, plants that thrive in [[saline water|saline]] environments, such as seacoasts and [[salt marshes]]. The original English glasswort plants belong to the [[genus]] ''[[Salicornia]]'', but today the glassworts include halophyte plants from several genera, some of which are native to continents unknown to the medieval English, and growing in ecosystems, such as [[mangrove]] swamps, never envisioned when the term glasswort was coined.

The common name "glasswort" came into use in the 16th century to describe plants growing in England whose ashes could be used for making [[soda ash|soda-based]] (as opposed to [[potash]]-based) [[glass]].&lt;ref&gt;"Definition of ''glasswort''," ''Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition'' (Oxford University Press, 1989). Definition retrieved from [http://www.oed.com online edition] (subscription required) July 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;Turner, William (1995). ''A New Herball: Parts II and III'', edited by George T. L. Chapman, Frank McCombie, and Anne U. Wesencraft (Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-44549-8}}). This book contains a facsimile of Turner's original 1562 and 1568 volumes, along with an edited transcript. The transcript of Turner's article on Kali (p. 673) includes the sentence "Kali, as I do remember, hath no name in English, and although it be very plenteous in England, yet I never could meet with any man that knew it. But lest this herb should be without a name, it may be called Saltwurt, because it is salt in taste, and Salalkali is made thereof. It may also be called Glas Wede, because the ashes of it serve to make glass."&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Industrial uses==
The ashes of glasswort plants, and also of their Mediterranean counterpart [[saltwort]] plants, yield [[soda ash]], which is an important ingredient for [[glassmaking]] and [[soapmaking]]. Soda ash is an [[alkali]] whose active ingredient is now known to be [[sodium carbonate]]. 
Glasswort and saltwort plants sequester the sodium they absorb from salt water into their tissues (see ''[[Salsola soda]]''). Ashing of the plants converts some of this sodium into [[sodium carbonate]] (or "soda," in one of the old uses of the term).

In the medieval and early post-medieval centuries, various glasswort plants were collected at tidal marshes and other saline places in the Mediterranean region. The collected plants were burned. The resulting ashes were mixed with water. Sodium carbonate is soluble in water. Non-soluble components of the ashes sank to the bottom of the water container. The water with the sodium carbonate dissolved in it was then transferred to another container, and then the water was evaporated off, leaving behind the sodium carbonate. Another major component of the ashes that is soluble in water is potassium carbonate, a.k.a. potash. The resulting product consisted mainly of a mixture of sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. This product was called "soda ash" (was also called "alkali"). It contained 20% to 30% sodium carbonate. For glassmaking, it was superior to a potash product obtained by the same procedure from the ashes of non-salty plants. If plant ashes were not washed as just described, they were still usable in glassmaking but the results were not as good.

The appearance of the word ''glasswort'' in English is reasonably contemporaneous with a 16th-century resurgence in English glassmaking, which had suffered a long decline after Roman times.&lt;ref&gt;Engle, Anita (1977).

See also the [http://www.hebrewhistory.info/factpapers.htm web version], retrieved July 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This resurgence was led by glassmakers who emigrated to England from [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] and from [[Venice]]. The Lorraine glassmakers brought with them the technology of [[forest glass]], the greenish glass that used [[potash]] from wood ashes as a flux. The [[Venetian glass]]makers brought with them the technology of [[cristallo]], the immaculately clear glass that used [[soda ash]] as a flux. These glassmakers would have recognized ''[[Salicornia europaea]]'' growing in England as a source for soda ash. Prior to their arrival, it was said that the plant "hath no name in English."&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt;

By the 18th century, [[Spain]] had an enormous industry producing soda ash from saltworts; the soda ash from this source was known as ''[[barilla|barrilla]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, Joaquín Fernández (1998).

The source of this ash was [[kelp]]. This industry was so lucrative that it led to overpopulation in the [[Western Isles]] of Scotland, and one estimate is that 100,000 people were occupied with "kelping" during the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;Clow, Archibald and Clow, Nan L. (1952). ''Chemical Revolution,'' (Ayer Co Pub, June 1952), pp. 65&amp;ndash;90. {{ISBN|0-8369-1909-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, soda ash (''la soude de Narbonne'') was produced in quantity from glasswort proper around [[Narbonne]], France.&lt;ref&gt;Pereira, Jonathan (1842). ''Elements of Materia Medica and Therapeutics, Vol. I'' (Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, London), p. 551. Pereira indicates that ''soude de Narbonne'' was obtained from ''Salicornia herbacea'', and had an alkali content of 14-15%. Online version at https://books.google.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fremy, Edmond (1883). ''Encyclopédie Chimique: Tome V, Application de Chimique Inorganique'' (Dunod, Paris), p. 548. [https://books.google.com/books?id=saQAAAAAMAAJ Online version] retrieved July 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The commercialization of the [[Leblanc process]] for synthesizing sodium carbonate (from salt, [[limestone]], and [[sulfuric acid]]) brought an end to the era of farming for soda ash in the first half of the 19th century.

Joseph Nathan and Co. was founded in 1873 as a general trading company in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, by a Londoner, [[Joseph Nathan (businessman)|Joseph Edward Nathan]].&lt;ref&gt;R. P. T. Davenport-Hines, Judy Slinn, ''Glaxo: A History to 1962'', Cambridge University Press, 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;7–13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 it began producing a dried-milk baby food from excess milk produced on the family farms outside [[Bunnythorpe]]. The resulting product was first known as Defiance, then as Glaxo (from ''lacto''), under the slogan "Glaxo builds bonny babies."&lt;ref&gt;David Newton, ''Trademarked: A History of Well-Known Brands, from Airtex to Wright's Coal Tar'', The History Press, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;435.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ravenscraft2000&gt;David J.

The company's first pharmaceutical product, released in 1924, was vitamin D.&lt;ref name=Ravenscraft2000/&gt;{{rp|306}}

Glaxo Laboratories was registered as a subsidiary company in London in 1935. Glaxo bought out its parent, Joseph Nathan in 1947 and acquired [[Allen &amp; Hanburys]] in 1958. The Scottish pharmacologist [[David Jack (scientist)|David Jack]] was hired as a researcher for Allen &amp; Hanburys a few years after Glaxo took it over; he went on to lead the company's R&amp;D until 1987.&lt;ref name=Ravenscraft2000/&gt;{{rp|306}} After the company bought Meyer Laboratories in 1978, it began to play an important role in the US market. In 1983 the American arm, Glaxo Inc., moved to [[Research Triangle Park]] (US headquarters/research) and Zebulon (US manufacturing) in North Carolina.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Burroughs Wellcome &amp; Company was founded in 1880 in London by the American pharmacists [[Henry Wellcome]] and [[Silas Mainville Burroughs (pharmacist)|Silas Burroughs]].

[[File:BeechamsBuilding.jpg|thumb|Beecham's Clock Tower, constructed 1877, part of the [[Beecham (pharmaceutical company)|Beecham]]'s factory, [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]]]]

In 1848 [[Thomas Beecham (chemist)|Thomas Beecham]] launched his [[Beecham's Pills]] laxative in England, giving birth to the [[Beecham Group]]. In 1859 Beecham opened its first factory in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]], [[Lancashire]]. By the 1960s Beecham was extensively involved in pharmaceuticals and consumer products such as Macleans toothpaste, Lucozade and synthetic penicillin research.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corely|first1=T.A.B.|title=Beechams, 1848-2000: from Pills to Pharmaceuticals|date=2011|publisher=Crucible Books|isbn=1905472145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John K. Smith]] opened his first pharmacy in Philadelphia in 1830. In 1865 [[Mahlon Kline]] joined the business, which 10 years later became Smith, Kline &amp; Co. In 1891 it merged with French, Richard and Company, and in 1929 changed its name to [[SmithKline &amp; French|Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories]] as it focused more on research. Years later it bought Norden Laboratories, a business doing research into animal health, and [[Recherche et Industrie Thérapeutiques]] in Belgium in 1963 to focus on vaccines. The company began to expand globally, buying seven laboratories in Canada and the United States in 1969. In 1982 it bought [[Allergan]], a manufacturer of eye and skincare products.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

SmithKline &amp; French merged with Beckman Inc. in 1982 and changed its name to ''SmithKline Beckman''. In 1988 it bought its biggest competitor, International Clinical Laboratories, and in 1989 merged with [[Beecham (pharmaceutical company)|Beecham]] to form ''SmithKline Beecham plc''. The headquarters moved from the United States to England. To expand R&amp;D in the United States, the company bought a new research center in 1995; another opened in 1997 in England at New Frontiers Science Park, [[Harlow]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Controversies==
===2012 criminal and civil settlement===
====Overview====
In July 2012 GSK pleaded guilty in the United States to criminal charges, and agreed to pay $3 billion, in what was the [[List of Largest Pharmaceutical Settlements|largest settlement]] until then between the Justice Department and a drug company. The $3 billion included a criminal fine of $956,814,400 and forfeiture of $43,185,600. The remaining $2 billion covered a civil settlement with the government under the [[False Claims Act]]. The investigation was launched largely on the basis of information from four whistleblowers who filed [[qui tam]] (whistleblower) lawsuits against the company under the False Claims Act.&lt;ref name=USDOJJuly2012&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/July/12-civ-842.html "GlaxoSmithKline to Plead Guilty and Pay $3 Billion to Resolve Fraud Allegations and Failure to Report Safety Data"], United States Department of Justice, 2 July 2012.{{pb}}

The charges stemmed from GSK's promotion of the anti-depressants Paxil ([[paroxetine]]) and Wellbutrin ([[bupropion]]) for unapproved uses from 1998–2003, specifically as suitable for patients under the age of 18, and from its failure to report safety data about Avandia ([[rosiglitazone]]), both in violation of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]. Other drugs promoted for unapproved uses were two inhalers, Advair ([[fluticasone/salmeterol]]) and Flovent ([[fluticasone propionate]]), as well as Zofran ([[ondansetron]]), Imitrex ([[sumatriptan]]), Lotronex ([[alosetron]]) and Valtrex ([[valaciclovir]]).&lt;ref name=USDOJJuly2012/&gt;

The settlement also covered reporting false best prices and underpaying rebates owed under the [[Medicaid Drug Rebate Program]], and kickbacks to physicians to prescribe GSK's drugs. There were all-expenses-paid spa treatments and hunting trips for doctors and their spouses, speakers' fees at conferences, and payment for articles [[Medical ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by the company and placed by physicians in medical journals.&lt;ref name=USDOJJuly2012/&gt; The company set up a ghostwriting programme called CASPPER, initially to produce articles about Paxil but which was extended to cover Avandia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Baucus]], [[Chuck Grassley]], [http://finance.senate.gov/newsroom/chairman/download/?id=a5c07780-6351-4905-8c63-52e4a7a7a66b "Finance Committee Letter to the FDA Regarding Avandia"], United States Senate Finance Committee, 12 July 2010.&lt;p&gt;
Jim Edwards, [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/inside-gsks-cassper-ghostwriting-program/ "Inside GSK's CASSPER Ghostwriting Program"], CBS News, 21 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the settlement GSK signed a five-year [[corporate integrity agreement]] with the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], which obliged the company to make major changes in the way it did business, including changing its compensation programmes for its sales force and executives, and to implement and maintain transparency in its research practices and publication policies.&lt;ref name=USDOJJuly2012/&gt; It announced in 2013 that it would no longer pay doctors to promote its drugs or attend medical conferences, and that its sales staff would no longer have prescription targets.&lt;ref name=Reuters17Dec2013&gt;[http://sustainability.thomsonreuters.com/2013/12/17/gsk-stop-paying-doctors-major-marketing-overhaul "GSK to stop paying doctors in major marketing overhaul"], Thomson/Reuters, 17 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rosiglitazone (Avandia)====

[[File:Avandia 2mg oral tablet.jpg|thumb|[[Rosiglitazone]]]]
The 2012 settlement included a criminal fine of $242,612,800 for failing to report safety data to the FDA about Avandia ([[rosiglitazone]]), a [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]] drug approved in 1999, and a civil settlement of $657 million for making false claims about it. The Justice Department said GSK had promoted rosiglitazone to physicians with misleading information, including that it conferred cardiovascular benefits despite an FDA-mandated label warning of cardiovascular risks.&lt;ref name=USDOJJuly2012/&gt;

In 1999 [[John Buse]], a diabetes specialist, told medical conferences that rosiglitazone might carry an increased risk of cardiovascular problems. GSK threatened to sue him, called his university head of department, and persuaded him to sign a retraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finance.senate.gov/download/?id=883E903D-F973-4A74-8432-3C651C71B4B4 "The Intimidation of Dr. John Buse and the Diabetes Drug Avandia"], Committee on Finance, United States Senate, November 2007, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; GSK raised questions internally about the drug's safety in 2000, and in 2002 the company [[Medical ghostwriter|ghostwrote]] an article in [[Circulation (journal)|''Circulation'']] describing a GSK funded clinical trial that suggested rosiglitazone might have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Baucus]], [[Chuck Grassley]], [http://finance.senate.gov/newsroom/chairman/download/?id=a5c07780-6351-4905-8c63-52e4a7a7a66b "Finance Committee Letter to the FDA Regarding Avandia"], United States Senate Finance Committee, 12 July 2010; for internal concerns, p. 2 and attachment E, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–35; for ghostwriting, p. 3 and attachment H, pp. 58–109; for the ghostwriting, attachment I, p. 110ff; for cover letter to ''Circulation'', attachment I, p.&amp;nbsp;143; for the ghostwritten article, attachment I, pp.&amp;nbsp;152–158.{{pb}}

For 10 years GSK marketed Paxil as non-habit forming.

====Bupropion (Wellbutrin)====
The company was also fined for promoting Wellbutrin ([[bupropion]])&amp;nbsp;– approved at the time for [[major depressive disorder]] and also sold as a smoking-cessation aid, Zyban&amp;nbsp;– for weight loss and the treatment of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], sexual dysfunction and substance addiction.

In the 1960s Glaxo Group Ltd.

There were concerns in the 2000s about the sugar and vitamin content of [[Ribena]], a [[blackcurrant]]-based [[syrup]] and [[soft drink]] owned by GSK until 2013. Produced in England by H.W. Carter &amp; Co from the 1930s, the company's unbranded syrup was distributed to children as a source of [[vitamin C]] during World War II, which gave the drink a reputation as good for health. [[Beecham Group|Beecham]] bought H. W. Carter in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Thring, [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/sep/07/consider-squash-cordial "Consider squash and cordial"], ''The Guardian'', 7 September 2010.{{pb}}

In 2001 the British [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) required GSK to withdraw its claim that Ribena Toothkind, a lower-sugar variety, did not encourage tooth decay. A company poster showed bottles of Toothkind in place of the bristles on a toothbrush. The ASA's ruling was upheld by the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;Linus Gregoriadis, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1318417/Makers-of-Ribena-lose-fight-over-anti-decay-claims.html "Makers of Ribena lose fight over anti-decay claims"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 18 January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 GSK was fined $217,000 in New Zealand over its claim that ready-to-drink Ribena contained high levels of vitamin C, after it was found to contain no detectable vitamin C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10431253|title=Judge orders Ribena to fess up|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|author=David Eames|date=28 March 2007}}{{pb}}

===SB Pharmco Puerto Rico===
In 2010 the US Department of Justice announced that GSK would pay a $150 million criminal fine and forfeiture, and a civil settlement of $600 million under the False Claims Act. The fines stemmed from production of improperly made and adulterated drugs from 2001 to 2005 at GSK's subsidiary, SB Pharmco Puerto Rico Inc., in Cidra, Puerto Rico, which at the time produced $5.5 billion of products each year. The drugs involved were [[Kytril]], an antiemetic; [[Bactroban]], used to treat skin infections; Paxil, the anti-depressant; and [[Avandamet]], a diabetes drug.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/October/10-civ-1205.html "GlaxoSmithKline to Plead Guilty &amp; Pay $750 Million to Resolve Criminal and Civil Liability Regarding Manufacturing Deficiencies at Puerto Rico Plant"], U.S. Department of Justice, 26 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; GSK closed the factory in 2009.&lt;ref name=NYTPuerto&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/business/27drug.html | title = Glaxo to Pay $750 Million for Sale of Bad Products | work = The New York Times | date = 27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''New York Times'', the case began in 2002 when GSK sent experts to fix problems cited by the FDA. The lead inspector recommended recalls of defective products, but they were not authorised; she was fired in 2003 and filed a whistleblower lawsuit. In 2005 federal marshals seized $2 billion worth of products, the largest such seizure in history. In the 2010 settlement SB Pharmco plead guilty to criminal charges, and agreed to pay $150&amp;nbsp;million in a criminal fine and forfeiture, at that time the largest such payment ever by a manufacturer of adulterated drugs, and $600&amp;nbsp;million in civil penalties to settle the civil lawsuit.&lt;ref  name=NYTPuerto/&gt;

===Market manipulation in the UK===
In February 2016 the company was fined over £37 million in the UK by the [[Competition and Markets Authority]] for paying [[Generics UK]], [[Alpharma]] and [[Norton Healthcare]] more than £50m between 2001 and 2004 to keep generic varieties of [[paroxetine]] out of the UK market. The generics companies were fined a further £8 million.

Italian police sought bribery charges in May 2004 against 4,400 doctors and 273 GSK employees. GSK and its predecessor were accused of having spent £152m on physicians, pharmacists and others, giving them cameras, computers, holidays and cash. Doctors were alleged to have received cash based on the number of patients they treated with a cancer drug, [[topotecan]] (Hycamtin).&lt;ref&gt;John Hooper, Heather Stewart, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/may/27/italy.heatherstewart "Over 4,000 doctors face charges in Italian drugs scandal"], ''The Guardian'', 27 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The following month prosecutors in Munich accused 70–100 doctors of having accepted bribes from SmithKline Beecham between 1997 and 1999.

In 2006 in the United States GSK settled the largest tax dispute in IRS history, agreeing to pay $3.1&amp;nbsp;billion. At issue were Zantac and other products sold in 1989–2005. The case revolved around intracompany [[transfer pricing]]—determining the share of profit attributable to the US subsidiaries of GSK and subject to tax by the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/12/business/worldbusiness/12glaxo.html "GlaxoSmithKline to Settle Tax Dispute With U.S."], Reuters, 12 September 2006; [https://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Accepts-Settlement-Offer-in-Largest-Transfer-Pricing-Dispute "IRS Accepts Settlement Offer in Largest Transfer Pricing Dispute"], IRS, 11 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gramercy Pictures''' is an American [[Production company|film production]] label of [[Universal Studios]]' [[Focus Features]] division, both of which are owned by [[NBCUniversal]] which is ultimately owned by [[Comcast]]. It was founded in May 1992 as a [[joint venture]] between [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]] and [[Universal Pictures]]. Gramercy was the distributor of PolyGram films in the United States and Canada and also served as Universal's art-house division. After Seagram's buyout of PolyGram, Gramercy along with [[October Films]] were merged by [[Barry Diller]] to form [[USA Films]] in 1999. In 2015, Focus Features (the current art-house division for Universal) revived the name as a label for action, horror and sci-fi genre films.

==History==
Gramercy Pictures was formed in 1992 as a joint venture between PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Universal Pictures.&lt;ref name=dl&gt;{{cite news|last1=Petski|first1=Denise|title=Focus Features Revives Gramercy Pictures Label For Genre Films|url=http://deadline.com/2015/05/focus-features-revives-gramercy-pictures-label-genre-films-1201430500/|accessdate=May 20, 2015|publisher=deadline.com|date=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gramercy Pictures released its first film, the [[Mario Van Peebles]] western [[Posse (1993 film)|''Posse'']], in May 1993.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite journal|author=Staff|title=In Winner's Circle; Miramax's 'Crying Game' paces indies; New Line still running strong|date=August 17, 1993|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Reed Business Information|quote=Off to an auspicious start is Gramercy Pictures, with its first release, 'Posse,' immediately making the chart [of largest rentals from independent distributors]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Box office information for ''Posse'' (1993) |last= |first= |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=posse.htm |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1996, PolyGram brought the 50% stake owned by Universal thus assuming full control of Gramercy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/11/business/gramercy-sold-to-polygram.html|title=Gramercy Sold To Polygram|date=11 January 1996|work=Reuters|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distributor also had box office hits in 1994's ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', 1996's ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'' and 1997's ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]''. Several Gramercy releases of the 1990s have grown in stature to become [[cult classics]] in the present day: ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'', ''[[Clay Pigeons]]'' and ''[[Mallrats]]''. In addition, 1995's ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' won two Oscars, for [[Best Original Screenplay]] ([[Christopher McQuarrie]]) and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] ([[Kevin Spacey]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

When [[Seagram]] acquired [[PolyGram]] in 1998, the latter was merged and folded into Universal; as a result, it reacquired Gramercy as it controlled Universal. In turn, Seagram sold the bulk of the PolyGram film library titles released up until March 31, 1996 to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1999, and later on, it sold Gramercy and another specialty division, [[October Films]], to [[Barry Diller]]'s [[USA Network]]s, which merged both companies into [[USA Films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aEJFAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wLsMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6746,3385144&amp;dq=gramercy%20pictures%20barry%20diller&amp;hl=en|title=The Telegraph-Herald - Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/28/business/fi-14956|title=Universal Adds Division for Specialty Films|first=JAMES|last=BATES|date=28 September 1999|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; USA Films was then merged with Universal's own art-house division, Universal Focus, and transformed into [[Focus Features]] in 2002 after [[Vivendi|Vivendi Universal]] acquired USA Networks from Diller.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Revival===
In May 2015, [[Focus Features]] announced that the Gramercy label has been revived to release action, horror and sci-fi genre films. Its first outing was ''[[Insidious: Chapter 3]]'' on June 5, 2015.&lt;ref name=dl/&gt;

'''Health marketing''' is a new, customer-centered, approach to [[public health]] promotion that applies traditional marketing principles and theories alongside science-based strategies to protect and promote the health of diverse populations.It involves creating, communicating, and delivering messages for the public on [[Preventive medicine|prevention]], [[health promotion]] and health protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/whatishm.html|title=What is Health Marketing? {{!}} Gateway to Health Communication {{!}} CDC|date=2017-02-23|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health marketing is one of the ways advancements in medicine and in health-protecting services, such as insurance, are made widely known.
A good example is the current drive in [[Kenya]] to promote circumcision among communities that do not customarily circumcise. [[Medical research]]ers have recently documented that circumcision is 65% effective in preventing [[HIV]] infection among men.

The marketing strategy would follow the traditional 4 "P's" of marketing namely:

*The "product" in question in this case the surgical procedure.
*The "place" which refers to the access to this procedure.
*"Promotion" refers to creating awareness and hence demand.
*"Price" refers to the cost of the procedure e.g. money, time, reputation etc.

"Health marketing" is a term rarely used in public health and related disciplines.  "Social marketing" or "integrated marketing communication" are more commonly used in public health and other disciplines to refer to marketing-based planning frameworks for public health communication.

&lt;br /&gt;

== Medical marketing in the private sector ==
'''Health marketing''' or '''Medical Marketing''' is a specialized branch of [[marketing]]. Medical marketing was born from the necessity for private health professionals to attract new patients, the characteristics of the health market makes it a unique kind of marketing. Medical marketing is usually a [[business to consumer]] (B2C) service. Doctors using this type of marketing usually offer beauty related services, such as [[aesthetic medicine]], [[plastic surgery]], [[dental surgery]] or [[dermatology]].  

=== Regulations. ===
In many countries it is forbidden to pay for advertising of medical procedures, specially in aesthetics and [[plastic surgery]]. Showing “before and after” pictures or making references to someone’s body type can be seen as harmful for society.

The solution for a health care professional or a [https://www.medicalmarketingagency.net medical marketing agency] is [[Instagram marketing]] since nowadays it remains unregulated, being the fastest growing social media in the planet gives doctors an opportunity to acquire new patients through Instagram Marketing.

'''Helge Palmcrantz''' (1842–1880), [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[inventor]] and [[industrialist]], was born in [[Hammerdal]], in the province of [[Jämtland]], the son of a [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] in the [[Jämtland Ranger Regiment]]. He was enlisted as a cadet in his father's [[regiment]], where he worked on [[Topographic surveying and mapping|land survey]]. After a couple of years he left the regiment to study at the Technological Institute of Stockholm (later known as [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH]]).

In partnership with his brother-in-law, [[Theodor Winborg]], Palmcrantz founded a small [[workshop]] on Vollmar Yxkullsgatan 25, [[Södermalm]], [[Stockholm]]. As number of employees increased along with the production volume, he moved to a new [[factory]] on [[Kungsholmen]], [[Stockholm]], where they manufactured [[firearms]], [[reaping machine]]s, [[mower]]s and other [[agricultural]] equipment of their own design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =The Commissioners of patents' journal |chapter = patent 2309|publisher= Great Britain. Patent Office |year=1876 |page=2153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on there would be Palmcrantz &amp; Co factory on [[Lövholmen]], [[Stockholm]] as well; later called [[Palmcrantzska Fabriken]].

In 1868, the first version of his machine-gun was finished and a demonstration of its capacity was held on [[Ladugårdsgärdet]], [[Stockholm]] in front of the Swedish Defense Minister; G.R. Abel. After a couple of modifications and improvements, he patented the multi-barrel, lever-actuated, [[machine gun]] and it was bought into the Swedish army as [[Kulspruta m/1873]]. Same year, the machine-gun was shown on the [[1873 Vienna World's Fair]]. To reach international success, Palmcrantz met Nordenfelt in 1875 and the latter's company became his British agent. They agreed to market the [[machine-gun]] under the then well known Nordenfelt brand and his second model [[kulspruta m/1875]] would later be known as the ''[[Nordenfelt gun|Nordenfelt machine-gun]]'' after his financial backer, [[Thorsten Nordenfelt]]. . It was Nordenfelt who convinced Palmcrantz to increase the [[caliber]] of his [[gun]] to one inch, making it a suitable [[weapon]] for use against the growing threat of [[torpedo boat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Machine Gun: The Story of the Men and the Weapon That Changed the Face of War |first=Anthony |last=Smith| publisher= Macmillan|year= 2004 |page=69|ISBN = 978-0-312-93477-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Palmcrantz succumbed to an early death from a bleeding [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]], Winborg and Nordenfelt continued to develop and manufacture his guns in [[Sweden]], [[England]] and [[Spain]].

Helge Palmcrantz has a school named after him; [[Palmcrantzskolan]] in [[Östersund]]. The block names "Kulsprutan" and "Lavetten" on Kungsholmen is named after his factories at Hantverkargatan.

== Angola sovereign wealth fund ==
In November 2017 the [[BBC News]] reported about him in relation to the [[Paradise Papers]].&lt;ref name="demorais"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41906123|title=Paradise Papers: Tycoon made $41m from 'people's fund'|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC News|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paradise Papers reported his use of Angola's [[sovereign wealth fund]] for his own investment projects.&lt;ref name="par"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/07/angola-sovereign-wealth-fund-jean-claude-bastos-de-morais-paradise-papers|title=Angola sovereign wealth fund's manager used its cash for his own projects|author=David Left|date=7 November 2017|work=The Guardian|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Paradise Papers were leaked&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/07/angola-sovereign-wealth-fund-jean-claude-bastos-de-morais-paradise-papers|title=Angola sovereign wealth fund's manager used its cash for his own projects|last=Pegg|first=David|date=2017-11-07|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; licenses of seven funds of Bastos' Quantum Global were suspended on Mauritius after a visit of Angolan officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-09/suspended-mauritian-funds-said-to-be-linked-to-angolan-founder|title=Mauritius Suspends Quantum Funds After Angola Official Visit|last=|first=|date=2018-04-09|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mauritius Supreme Court froze 519 million USD on 58 bank accounts of Quantum Global in early April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-10/mauritius-is-said-to-freeze-519-million-of-quantum-s-assets|title=Mauritius Freezes $519 Million of Quantum’s Assets|last=|first=|date=2018-04-10|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London a British court froze 3 billion USD on Quantum Global accounts at the end of April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-24/son-of-ex-angolan-president-seeks-to-overturn-u-k-freeze-order|title=Ex-Angolan Leader’s Son Seeks Overturn of Freeze Order|last=|first=|date=2018-04-28|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of July 2018 the freezing of British bank accounts was lifted by London's [[High Court of Justice|High Court]]. It ruled, that the freezing was based on false information. The court accused the state funds representatives of "breaches of the duty of disclosure" in the fund's application for a freezing and called this breaches "substantial" and "culpable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-angola-swf-litigation/uk-judge-lifts-asset-freeze-order-against-quantum-global-in-angolan-swf-case-idUKKBN1KL1W9|title=UK judge lifts asset freeze order against Quantum Global in Angolan...|last=Milhench|first=Claire|work=U.K.|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first radio station to continuously operate in the city and was a regional channel that could be heard across a large geographical area of [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]], as well as some bordering states during the daytime. The station was a [[CBS]] affiliate.

On December 19, 1947, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] approved the sale of KWFT from Mr. and Mrs. Joe P. Carrigan, Laura Lou Carrigan and Mrs. Elizabeth Carrigan Simpson to Edward H. Rowley, H.J. Griffith and Kenyon Brown, operating as KWFT, Incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KWFT Wichita Falls Sale Gets Approval of FCC|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1947/1947-12-22-BC.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=December 22, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, KWFT joined other radio stations in the [[United States]] by plunging into the new medium of [[television]]. '''KWFT-TV''' signed on the air onto channel 6 on March 1 and was the first television station in the city. It was an affiliate of the CBS television network. KWFT later sold the TV station in 1956 at which time channel 6 became '''KSYD-TV''' and later '''[[KAUZ-TV]]''' in 1963, continuing as the CBS affiliate for the Wichita Falls-Lawton market.

KWFT Radio continued for many years after the divesture of the TV station as a radio station emphasizing local and national news, weather, farm reports and middle-of-the-road music format. However, the emergence of a preponderance of FM stations in Wichita Falls offering country and rock music formats during the 1970s and 1980s greatly cut into KWFT's audience and advertising dollars, leading to the sale of the station in the mid-1990s to a new owner who signed off KWFT's last broadcast at 11:59&amp;nbsp;p.m. on December 24, 1994.

===AM 620's move to DFW: KAAM and Radio Disney===
About two years later, the 620 frequency formerly assigned to Wichita Falls returned to the airwaves in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex as '''[[KAAM]]'''. The station was sold to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] for $12 million and switch to the [[Radio Disney]] format in July 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sayewitz|first1=Ronni|title=Radio Disney eyes doubling its stations by '99|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/1998/08/10/story6.html|accessdate=June 8, 2016|work=Dallas Business Journal|publisher=American City Business Journals|date=August 9, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, KAAM was renamed '''KMKI''' (from Disney Character [[Mickey Mouse|'''M'''ic'''K'''ey Mouse]]).

Up until Radio Disney's move from [[Dallas]] to [[Burbank, California]], KMKI was the network's [[flagship station]].

Sometime in May 2014, [[Mediabase]] has moved KMKI, along with other Radio Disney-affiliated stations to the [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40/CHR]] panel. Although Radio Disney is still considered a Children's station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/128957/mediabase-announces-panel-changes Mediabase Announces Panel Changes] (Published April 22, 2014, Retrieved August 8, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Radio Disney Dallas.png|200px|thumb|Final Radio Disney logo for KMKI.]]

On August 13, 2014, Disney put KMKI and twenty-two other [[Radio Disney]] stations up for sale, in order to focus more on digital distribution of the Radio Disney network. Originally, KMKI's affiliation would be discontinued on or after September 26, 2014,&lt;ref name=b&amp;c-radiodisneysell2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lafayette|first1=Jon|title=Exclusive: Radio Disney Moving Off Air to Digital|url=http://broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/exclusive-radio-disney-moving-air-digital/133166|accessdate=August 13, 2014|date=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radio Insight"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/89717/radio-disney-to-sell-all-but-one-station/ |title=Radio Disney To Sell All But One Station |date=August 13, 2014 |accessdate=August 13, 2014 |last=Venta |first=Lance |publisher=Radio Insight }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=billboard-selling&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Disney to Sell the Majority of Its Stations|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/6214509/radio-disney-to-sell-the-majority-of-its-stations|website=Billboard|accessdate=13 August 2014|ref=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Disney has decided to keep the programming on KMKI until the sale of this and other RD stations take place. KMKI, now KEXB, has a license to broadcast a digital signal using iBiquity's "[[HD Radio]]" but has suspended transmission of such months prior to the sale announcement.  Because the license to broadcast digital "HD Radio" is perpetual, the station could resume digital broadcasts at any time.

===Sale to Salem, change to Business===
On June 5, 2015, it was announced that Salem Media Group would acquire KMKI for $3 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/93236/salem-acquires-disney-stations-in-boston-dallas/ Salem Acquires Disney Stations in Boston and Dallas] - ''Radio Insight''&lt;/ref&gt; The station was sold to [[Salem Media Group]] on September 15, 2015&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/145622/oregon-fm-license-sold-puerto-rico-am-donated&lt;/ref&gt; and, as a result, the station discontinued its Radio Disney affiliate and went silent.  620 AM returned to the air on September 18, 2015, simulcasting programming from [[KWRD-FM]]. On September 25, 2015, KMKI began simulcasting new sister [[KBDT|KVCE]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfw.com/2015/09/25/1034907_biz-talk-kvce1160-am-moving-to.html Biz-talk KVCE/1160 AM moving to 620 AM - DFW.com]&lt;/ref&gt; KVCE's programming still had the branding and imaging of the 1160 frequency for one week, until October 1. Also on that day, KMKI changed call letters to  '''KEXB''' (standing for “'''Ex'''perts in '''B'''usiness).&lt;ref&gt;https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=49320&amp;Callsign=KEXB&lt;/ref&gt; The current Radio Disney programming for the region has since moved to the [[KLUV]] HD3 digital subchannel after the network's 7-month absence from the DFW market.

{{Software development process}}
'''Kanban''' (Mandarin Chinese 看板, Kànbǎn, "dashboard") is a [[lean manufacturing | lean method]] to manage and improve [[work (disambiguation) | work]] across human [[system]]s. This approach aims to manage work by balancing demands with available capacity, and by improving the handling of system-level [[Bottleneck (production) | bottlenecks]]. 

Work items are visualized to give participants a view of progress and process, from start to finish - usually via a [[Kanban board]]. Work is [[Push–pull strategy| pulled]] as capacity permits, rather than work being pushed into the process when requested.

In [[knowledge worker| knowledge work]] and in [[software development]], the aim is to provide a visual [[process management | process-management]] system which aids decision-making about what, when and how much to produce. The underlying [[Kanban]] method originated in [[lean manufacturing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Machine That Changed the World|year= 2007|author= James P. Womack|ISBN= 978-1847370556}}
&lt;/ref&gt; (inspired by the [[Toyota Production System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Main|Kanban board}}
[[File:Kanban board example.jpg|thumb]]
Although Kanban does not require that the team or organization use a [[Kanban board]], they can be used to visualise the flow of work. Typically a Kanban board shows how work moves from left to right, each column represents a stage within the value stream. 

The image below is a typical view of a simplified Kanban board, where work items move from left to right. In some cases each column has a work in progress limit. This means that each column can only receive a fixed amount of work items with the aim to encourage focus, and make system constraints evident.

== {{anchor|Examples of use}}Examples ==
=== Software development ===

[[File:Sample Kanban Board.png|border|right|frameless]]
The diagram here and the one in the Kanban Board section shows a software development workflow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/priming-kanban-jesper-boeg|title=Priming Kanban|author=Jasper Boeg|date=February 2012|accessdate=2014-02-17|publisher=InfoQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boards, designed for the context in which they are used, vary considerably and may show work item types ("features" and "user stories" here), columns delineating workflow activities, explicit policies, and swimlanes (rows crossing several columns, used for grouping user stories by feature here). The aim is to make the general workflow and the progress of individual items clear to participants and stakeholders.

=== Other uses ===

Although it is usually used for software development and software teams, the kanban method has been applied to other aspects of knowledge work.&lt;ref&gt;Leybourn, E. (2013).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3498">'''Ole Christian Bach''' (31 May 1957 – 11 July 2005) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[con artist]].

In 1988, he was convicted on charges of fraud and sentenced to 4 years in [[prison]].&lt;ref name="Local"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.se/1723/20050712/|title=Millionaire shoots himself after police chase|date=12 July 2005|work=[[The Local]]|accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted again for his involvement with the theft and sale of [[Edvard Munch]]'s ''[[Madonna (Edvard Munch)|Madonna]]'' in 1992,&lt;ref name="Local"/&gt; and sentenced to 7 months in prison.
Bach managed to establish new connections, most importantly with [[Gerard Cok]]. Cok controlled the German porn enterprise [[Beate Uhse]], and he trusted Bach with the establishment of porn shops in Norway and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/bach-saken/dette-var-ole-christian-bach/a/283651/ "Dette var Ole Christian Bach"], Per Valebrok in ''[[Verdens Gang|VG]]'' 12.7.2005&lt;/ref&gt; With security in an estate out of Oslo, Cok also gave Bach a NOK 60.000.000 loan. The security later turned out to be only in the estate's boat house.&lt;ref name="Hegnar"&gt;"[http://www.hegnar.no/okonomi/politikk/artikkel115735.ece Pornomilliardæren saksøker Bachs advokat]" Haugen in Hegnar.no 1.10.2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 he was again charged with economic [[fraud]]. On 11 July 2005, he committed [[suicide]] in [[Sweden]] after a car chase with Swedish undercover police.&lt;ref name="Local"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
After Bach's death, Gerhard Cok sued Ole Christian Bach's lawyer [[Ronny Mulstad]] for his role in securing Cok's loan to Bach.&lt;ref name="Hegnar"/&gt; The dispute was settled outside court.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/forlik-for-bach-advokat/1851006.html Forlik for Bach-advokat]" ''[[Nettavisen]]'' 9.10.2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the journalists who covered the Bach's hiding came under investigation after Bach's death. One journalist was fined for having helped Bach to avoid arrest by paying him for interviews.&lt;ref&gt;"Bot til journalist for å ha bistått person på flukt fra politiet", [http://www.okokrim.no/id/E8EAB738B5C0C3D8C1257589003C9251 Økokrim 23.1.2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923085822/http://www.okokrim.no/id/E8EAB738B5C0C3D8C1257589003C9251 |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A magazine was fined for similar reasons.&lt;ref&gt;"Bot til ukeblad-forlag for å ha bistått person på flukt fra politiet"  [http://www.okokrim.no/id/D8FBF78CBC54FF61C12576490026339F Økokrim 8.10.2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923085730/http://www.okokrim.no/id/D8FBF78CBC54FF61C12576490026339F |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OmniFocus''' is a personal [[Task management|task manager]] by [[The Omni Group]] for [[macOS]] and [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]]. The declared goal of the program is to be able to capture thoughts and ideas into [[to do list]]s.&lt;ref name="OmniFocus Overview"&gt;OmniFocus Overview, http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/&lt;/ref&gt; The program uses concepts and techniques described in the book ''[[Getting Things Done]]''  by [[David Allen (author)|David Allen]]. Allen's productivity system is commonly abbreviated as GTD.

== History ==
OmniFocus has its roots in the Kinkless kGTD add/scripts for the Omnigroups [[OmniOutliner]] product.&lt;ref name='Oreilly Radar 2006-10-21'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/10/the-story-of-kgtd-and-omnifocu.html |title=The Story of KGTD and OmniFocus |accessdate=2009-01-13 |last=Forrest |first=Brady |date=2006-10-21 |publisher=OReilly Publishing |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502123106/http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/10/the-story-of-kgtd-and-omnifocu.html |archivedate=2008-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kinkless (kGTD) was developed by Ethan J. A. Schoonover to enable those following the GTD methodology.  The Omni Group subsequently brought Ethan along with [[Merlin Mann]] to form a project team to create the OmniFocus application.&lt;ref name='Omni Group interview: part 1'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.onsoftware.com/omnigroup-interview-part-1/ |title=The Story of KGTD and OmniFocus |accessdate=2009-01-13 |last=Roger |first=Cyril |date=2007-05-08 |publisher=onsoftware }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, version 3 of OmniFocus was released for iOS and macOS. With the release, the previous concept of contexts taken from GTD was replaced with tags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macstories.net/reviews/omnifocus-3-review-more-approachable-and-powerful-all-at-once/|title=OmniFocus 3 Review: More Approachable and Powerful, All at Once|website=MacStories||date=2018-05-30|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macstories.net/reviews/omnifocus-3-for-mac-multiple-tags-enhanced-forecast-powerful-perspectives/|title=OmniFocus 3 for Mac: Multiple Tags, Enhanced Forecast, Powerful Perspectives|website=MacStories||date=2018-09-24|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platforms==

===macOS===
OmniFocus is available for macOS.

===iOS===
OmniFocus is available on iOS (including the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad).

===Android===
The Omni Group does not have plans to provide an Android application for OmniFocus. [[Google Play]] lists various third-party applications which interface with OmniFocus through the Omni Sync Server (e.g., [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.burgstaller.android.focusgtd Focus GTD]).

=== Web Application ===
On January 26, 2018 Ken Case announced in the Omnigroup forums that Omnifocus for the web is under development. It will not be a standalone version; it will only sync with existing databases setup with the MacOS or iOS versions of Omnifocus. A subscription fee will be charged for access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/omni-roadmap-2018/36393#omnifocus3web|title=Omni Roadmap 2018|website=The Omni Group Forums|language=en|access-date=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Onsi Sawiris''' (also written '''Sawires''', {{Lang-cop|Ⲟⲩⲛⲥⲓ Ⲥⲉⲩⲏⲣⲟⲥ}}, {{lang-ar|أنسي ساويرس}}; born August 14, 1930) is an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[businessman]]. He was estimated to be worth approximately $1.2 billion according to ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/onsi-sawiris Onsi Sawiris - Forbes] Forbes.com, Accessed on May 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the patriarchal head of the [[Sawiris Family]]. 

In his early business career, he was disenchanted with the socialist government of Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. He was prevented from leaving the country for six years in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/feb/02/sawiris-independent|title=The Sawiris family: from entrepreneurs to media owners|last=Tryhorn|first=Chris|date=2010-02-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a spell in [[Libya]], he returned to Egypt during the more business-friendly regime of the following Egyptian president, [[Anwar Sadat]]. He and his three sons, all educated in Europe and the United States, resumed their activities in Egypt over the past three decades under the government of [[Hosni Mubarak]] and its liberal business policies.

He founded the [[Orascom group|Orascom conglomerate]], whose various construction, telecommunications and tourism, science and technology and industry companies are run by his three sons, [[Naguib Sawiris]], [[Nassef Sawiris]], [[Samih Sawiris]]. Orascom is involved in [[tourism|tourism development]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[construction]] and other fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6300">{{Wiktionary|out-of-pocket}}
An '''out-of-pocket expense''' (or '''out-of-pocket cost''') is the direct payment of money that may or may not be later [[reimbursement|reimbursed]] from a third-party source.

For example, when operating a vehicle, [[gasoline]], parking fees and [[Road pricing|tolls]] are considered out-of-pocket expenses for a trip. [[Car insurance]], [[oil]] changes, and [[interest]] are not, since the outlay of cash covers expenses accrued over a longer period of time. The services rendered and other in-kind expenses are not considered out-of-pocket expenses; the same goes for [[depreciation]] of [[capital goods]] or [[depletion (accounting)|depletion]].

Organizations often reimburse out-of-pocket expenses incurred on their behalf, especially expenses incurred by employees on their employers' behalf. In the [[United States]], out-of-pocket expenses for such things as charity, medical bills, and education may be deductions on [[US income taxes]], according to [[IRS]] regulations.

To be '''out of pocket''' is to have expended personal resources, often unexpectedly or unfairly, at the end of some enterprise.

==Health financing==
In the [[Health care system#Financing|health care financing]] sector, this represents the share of the expenses that the insured party must pay directly to the health care provider, without a third-party (insurer, or government).&lt;ref name="pmid17625126"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=McWilliams JM, Meara E, Zaslavsky AM, Ayanian JZ | title=Use of health services by previously uninsured Medicare beneficiaries. | journal=N Engl J Med | year= 2007 | volume= 357 | issue= 2 | pages= 143–53 | doi=10.1056/NEJMsa067712 | pmc= | pmid=17625126  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United States'''

Out-of-pocket costs are high especially when it comes to prescription drugs in the United States.&lt;ref name="pmid23550670"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hurd MD, Martorell P, Delavande A, Mullen KJ, Langa KM | title=Monetary costs of dementia in the United States. | journal=N Engl J Med | year= 2013 | volume= 368 | issue= 14 | pages= 1326–34 | pmid=23550670 | doi=10.1056/NEJMsa1204629 | pmc=3959992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before investing in a health care plan, it is very useful to examine the out-of-pocket prescription costs as they may be very low or very high. High out-of-pocket costs may correlate with lower prescription adherence and more importation of medications from foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zullo|first1=AR|last2=Howe|first2=CJ|last3=Galárraga|first3=O|title=Estimating the Effect of Health Insurance on Personal Prescription Drug Importation.|journal=Medical care research and review : MCRR|date=2 February 2016|pmid=26837427|doi=10.1177/1077558716629039|volume=74|pmc=4970983|pages=178–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20818845"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kogan MD, Newacheck PW, Blumberg SJ, Ghandour RM, Singh GK, Strickland BB, etal | title=Underinsurance among children in the United States. | journal=N Engl J Med | year= 2010 | volume= 363 | issue= 9 | pages= 841–51 | doi=10.1056/NEJMsa0909994 | pmc= | pmid=20818845  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zullo|first1=Andrew R.|last2=Dore|first2=David D.|last3=Galárraga|first3=Omar|title=Development and validation of an index to predict personal prescription drug importation by adults in the United States|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical Health Services Research|date=March 2015|volume=6|issue=1|pages=33–41|doi=10.1111/jphs.12088|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jphs.12088/full|accessdate=27 July 2015|pmc=4930104}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medicare Part D]] is a federal program aimed at lowering prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries. However, after the first year of Medicare Part D, out-of-pocket drug costs were down, but there was not a noticeable reduction in [[emergency department]] visits, hospitalization, or health utility score. Perhaps, some diseases will be more sensitive to Medicare Part D.&lt;ref name="pmid23635051"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baicker K, Taubman SL, Allen HL, Bernstein M, Gruber JH, Newhouse JP, etal | title=The Oregon experiment--effects of Medicaid on clinical outcomes. | journal=N Engl J Med | year= 2013 | volume= 368 | issue= 18 | pages= 1713–22 | pmid=23635051 | doi=10.1056/NEJMsa1212321 | pmc=3701298 | url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/82640/1/Gruber_The%20oregon%20experiment.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/6/1735.full The Impact Of Medicare Part D On Prescription Drug Use By The Elderly]. Content.healthaffairs.org. Retrieved on 2011-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Australia'''

A recent study published from Australia shows that the out-of-pocket cost burden falls most heavily on patients who are least able to bear it, both in terms of their health and in terms of their income. Among the respondents 14% experienced a heavy financial burden. Medication and medical service expenses were the major costs. This study concluded that despite Australia's universal health coverage (medicare) a substantial portion of senior citizens suffer from excessive out-of-pocket expenditure, and this burden increases with increasing number of chronic conditions. Among the specific conditions, those who experienced cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes or depression were likely to report higher out-of-pocket expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM |author2=Yen, L |author3=Valderas, JM |author4=McRae, I |last-author-amp=yes |title= Out-of-pocket expenditure by Australian seniors with chronic disease: the effect of specific diseases and morbidity clusters |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=14 |pages=1008 |year=2014 |pmid= 25260348 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-1008 |pmc=4182884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ways to improve physician knowledge of drug costs were thought to be increased physician-patient communication or higher use of information technology. Physicians with high rates of IT use did not have significantly higher knowledge or drug costs. Health IT design should be improved to make it easier for physicians to access cost information at the point of care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://codingandbillingcareer.org/health-information-technology/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''PFTS Stock Exchange''' is a leading [[stock exchange]] in Ukraine that for a long time (until 2006) legally was considered as a [[trading system]], hence its name the First Stock Trading System (PFTS). 

The trading occurs on working days between 10:00 and 17:15 [[Kiev]] time ([[UTC+2]]). The [[PFTS index]] is calculated based on the results of the trading. Daily trade volume is about $30–60 million. Approximately 220 companies are listed on the PFTS, with a total market capitalization around $140 billion. For comparison, United States [[New York Stock Exchange]] capitalization is worth $25 trillion.

The PFTS Stock Trading System has been in operation since 1996 and currently is the largest marketplace and self-regulatory organization in Ukraine’s stock market. 

Originally it was the Association of the professional participants of the Ukraine stock market ''«Outside of Stock Exchange Share Trade System»'' ({{lang-uk|Позабіржова Фондова Торговельна Система}}, ПФТС), registered at the end of 1995. In September, 1998 the name ''«First Stock Trade System»'' ({{lang-uk|Перша Фондова Торговельна Система}}, ПФТС, '''PFTS''') was accepted, effectively keeping the Ukrainian abbreviation of the name ''PFTS'' unchanged.

Members of the Stock Exchange accounted for over 150 companies in 2010, headquarters of most of them located in Kyiv. The Stock exchange list accounts for nearly 800 entities with eleven of them classified under the first level of listing, 143 - the second level of listing, and the rest have assigned zero level of listing. 

The most expensive [[securities]] was issued by [https://web.archive.org/web/20081026031532/http://www.alef.ua/en/ Agra LLC] (ЗАТ "Агра") based in [[Dnipropetrovsk]]. Its 13 [[Bond (finance)|bond]]s nominated at ₴770 000 in 2010. [http://www.swedbank.ua/index.php?lang=en Swedbank] has the most number of securities with 215,910,025,800 [[Share (finance)|share]]s nominated at ₴0.01.

The '''profit impact of market strategy''' ('''PIMS''') database "yields solid evidence in support of both common sense and counter-intuitive principles for gaining and sustaining competitive advantage": Tom Peters and Nancy Austin. It was developed with the intention of providing [[empirical evidence]] of which [[business strategy|business strategies]] lead to success, across different industries. Data from the study is used to craft strategies in [[strategic management]] and [[marketing strategies|marketing strategy]]. The study identified several strategic variables that typically influence profitability. Some of the most important strategic variables studied were market share, product quality, investment intensity, and service quality, (all of which were found to be highly correlated with profitability).

According to Lancaster, Massingham and Ashford (''Essentials of Marketing'', 4th edition, McGraw Hill), PIMS seeks to address three basic questions:

* What is the typical profit rate for each type of business?
* Given current strategies in a company, what are the future operating results likely to be?
* What strategies are likely to help improve future operating results?

Dibb, Simkin, Pride and Ferrell (Marketing Concepts and Strategies, 4th European edition, Houghton Mifflin) cite six principal areas of information that PIMS holds on each business:

* characteristics of the business environment
* competitive position of the business
* structure of the production process
* how the budget is allocated
* strategic movement
* operating results.

== Brief history of PIMS ==

The PIMS project was started by [[Sidney Schoeffler]] working at [[General Electric]] in the 1960s, managed by the [[Marketing Science Institute]] in the early 1970s, and has been administered by the [[American Strategic Planning Institute]] since 1975.

It was initiated by senior managers at GE who wanted to know why some of their business units were more profitable than the others. With the help of Sidney Schoeffler they set up a research project in which each of their strategic business units reported their performance on dozens of variables. This was then expanded to outside companies in the early 1970s.

The initial survey, between 1970 and 1983, involved 2,600 [[strategic business unit]]s (SBU), from 200 companies. Today 12,500 observations exist for 4162 SBU's; PIMS is managed by PIMS Associates in London. Each SBU give information on the market within which they operated, the products they had brought to market and the efficacy of the strategies they had implemented.

The PIMS project analysed the data they had gathered to identify the options, problems, resources and opportunities faced by each SBU. Based on the spread of each business across different industries, it was hoped that the data could be drawn upon to provide other business, in the same industry, with empirical evidence of which strategies lead to increased profitability. The database continues to be updated and drawn upon by academics and companies today.

== Conclusions drawn by PIMS ==

The original PIMS data survey led the PIMS project to identify 37 variables which account for the majority of business success. Two leading marketing texts differ slightly on which variables are the most important, with Dibb, Simkin, Pride and Ferrell (p676) identifying:

* a strong market position
* high quality of product
* lower costs
* lower requirement for capital investment

and Lanacaster, Massingham and Ashford (p535) citing:

* market share
* image
* investment intensity
* market growth
* life cycle stage
* marketing expense to sales ratio.

While many of these seem obvious, PIMS has the advantage of providing empirical data that define quantitative relationships and back what some may consider to be common-sense.

== Participation in the PIMS study: cost and benefits ==

PIMS evaluated businesses' market position and suggest possible strategies, based on the data gathered from participating companies. Businesses wishing to use the service provide detailed information, including details of their:

* competitors and market
* balance sheet
* assumptions about future sales.

In return, PIMS provides four reports, described by Lancaster, Massingham and Ashford as:

1. A 'Par' report - showing the ROI and cash flows that are 'normal' for this type of business, given its market, competition, technology, and cost structure. 

2. A 'Strategy Analysis' report, which computes the predicted consequences of each of several alternative strategic actions, judged by information in similar businesses making similar moves, from a similar starting-point and in a similar business environment.

3. A 'Report on Look-Alikes' (ROLA), which aimed at predicting the best combination of strategies for that particular company, by analyzing strategically similar business more closely.

4. An 'Optimum Strategy' report, which is aimed at predicting the best combination of strategies for that particular company, again based on the experiences of other businesses in 'similar' circumstances.

== A critique of PIMS ==

Clearly, it could be argued that a database operating on information gathered in the period 1970 - 1983 is outdated. However data continues to be collected from participating companies and PIMS argues that it provides a unique source of time-series data, the conclusions from which have proven to be very stable over time.

It has also been suggested that PIMS is too heavily biased towards traditional, metal-bashing industries, such as [[car manufacturing]]; perhaps not surprising, considering the era in which the majority of the surveys were carried out. In reality, as of 2006, the 3,800+ businesses contained within the database includes data from the consumer, industrial and service sectors.

It is also heavily weighted towards large companies, at the expense of small entrepreneurial firms. This resulted from the data collection method used. Generally only larger firms are prepared to pay the consulting fee, provide the survey data, and in return have access to the database in which they can compare their business with other large businesses or SBUs. [[Mintzberg]] (1998) claims that because the database is dominated by large established firms, it is more suitable as a technique for assessing the state of "being there rather than getting there". (page 99)  This criticism is very important because if one is trying to get "average" results across industries to give us the "laws of the marketplace", a dubious enterprise as it is, the sampling strategy is important if one wants to obtain results that are representative.

The most important criticism leveled at PIMS is the fact that causation implies correlation but correlation does not imply causation.  One of the most important "findings" of the PIMS program was to find a statistically significant relationship between profitability and market share (see Buzzell and Gale (1987)).  The empirical work conducted by PIMS suggested that high market share yielded high profitability, but this correlation cannot be considered a "true" causal relationship because of the fact that correlation does not imply causation.  In the multivariate correlation analysis, high market share was  associated with high profits, but high profits could have been associated with high market share, or a third factor common to both could have caused the correlation.  Many analysts believe that it is possible to use a statistical causality test to determine causation, but if the whole problem is that correlation is insufficient to determine causation in the first place, then how can using another correlation, which is what is used in the tests, determine causation.

Another important criticism of PIMS is that it does not take into account heterogeneity in the data set.  The presumption of PIMS analysis is that the same "laws of the marketplace" apply to all industries.  However, the statistical assumptions employed in the econometric analysis make the assumption that all cross-sectional observations come from one statistical distribution that is the same for all cross-sectional observations.  This tends to be the Achilles heel of virtually all cross-sectional analyses.  If this homogeneous assumption is false, then cross-sectional observations are being drawn from different populations.  While one can use estimation techniques such as fixed-effects to control for different population means, co-variances can also differ across populations (meaning behavior differs across populations) and the only way one can control for this aspect is to run regressions on each population separately.  This means that the "laws of the marketplace" differ across populations, directly contradicting one of the main presumptions of using the PIMS data base for analysis.

Tellis and Golder (1996) claim that PIMS defines markets too narrowly. Respondents described their market very narrowly to give the appearance of high market share. They believe that this self reporting bias makes the conclusions suspect. They are also concerned that no defunct companies were included, leading to "survivor bias".

==Early life==
Shilo grew up in Nes Ziona, Israel and  was a member of the Israeli army&lt;ref name="Fast Company"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where he was an officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exposed in the Turret|url=http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/magazine/10/Homepage10.pdf|accessdate=31 July 2015|publisher=Technion University Computer Science Magazine|date=2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216110231/http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/magazine/10/homepage10.pdf|archivedate=16 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He graduated from the Technion, the Israeli Institute of Technology, with a BSc in Computer Science.&lt;ref name="Fast Company"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ronen Shilo, CEO, Conduit|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/user/ronen-shilo|accessdate=31 July 2015|publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Early in his career, Shilo worked for Ready Systems in Silicon Valley.&lt;ref name="Fast Company"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1995, he founded DoubleAgent, a collaborative technology company that aimed to enable application sharing online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ronen-shilo|title=Ronen Shilo, CrunchBase Profile|date=July 17, 2007|accessdate=April 12, 2012|work=[[CrunchBase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine months later the company was acquired by software company NetManage. Ronen served as manager of its Tel Aviv branch  before leaving in 1999 to start Effective-I, a learning system for corporate use. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=417740&amp;privcapId=417728&amp;previousCapId=36571034&amp;previousTitle=Conduit%20Ltd./|title=Ronen Shilo, Executive Profile and Biography|accessdate=April 12, 2012|work=[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilo founded Conduit in 2005 with partners Gaby Bilcyzk and Dror Erez to help publishers retain and engage users. Though the company has received venture funding, the three founders retain a majority share in the company.&lt;ref name="Pando"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pandodaily.com/2012/04/09/conduit-israels-first-billion-dollar-internet-company/|title=Conduit, Israel's First Billion Dollar Internet Company|date=April 9, 2012|accessdate= April 12, 2012|work=Pando Daily | first=Mick | last=Weinstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; H 

In the [[Financial Times]], he called the phenomena of Israeli companies selling too early as "Quick Sell" nation. &lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/9dc4c34c-afe1-11e1-a025-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2NR0n4Inj |title=Israeli VC struggles continue despite M&amp;A increase |date=June 6, 2012 |accessdate=March 13, 2013 |author=Lisa Damast and Jessica McHugh |publisher=''[[Financial Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli newspaper [[Haaretz]] mentioned him in the article "Four Reasons Not to Hate Israel's Big Business Tycoons" as one of a small number of Israeli tech CEOs who  "shunned the quick buck of an M&amp;A deal and stayed the course." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosenberg|first1=David|title=Four Reasons Not to Hate Israel's Big Business Tycoons|url=http://www.haaretz.com/business/david-com-vs-goliath-inc/four-reasons-not-to-hate-israel-s-big-business-tycoons-1.467383|accessdate=23 August 2015|publisher=Haaretz|date=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote an article for [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] in 2012 explaining why he had largely stayed out of the press despite running an Internet company with 260 million users.&lt;ref name="column"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shilo|first1=Ronen|title=A CEO Speaks Our About Speaking Out|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1822325/ceo-speaks-out-about-speaking-out|accessdate=31 July 2015|publisher=Fast Company|date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal ==
Shilo is married and has three children.&lt;ref name="Fast Company"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He told [[Inc.

{{nihongo|'''Shitagau Noguchi'''|野口 遵|Noguchi Shitagau|extra=July 26, 1873-January 15, 1944}} was a [[Japan]]ese entrepreneur who founded the Nichitsu ''[[zaibatsu]]''. Known as the father of electrochemical engineering in Japan, he invested heavily in the development of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]] and [[Manchukou]] in cooperation with the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Tokyo Shimbun, Aug. 9, 1999, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; His company was dissolved under the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|American occupation]] after [[World War II]], and its successor companies include the [[Chisso]] Corporation, and portions of [[Asahi Kasei]], Sekisui Chemical Company, and [[Shin-Etsu Chemical]].

==Biography==
Noguchi was born to a [[samurai]] class family in [[Kanazawa, Ishikawa|Kanazawa]], [[Ishikawa Prefecture]], Japan. He studied [[electrical engineering]] at the [[Tokyo Imperial University]] and was hired by [[Siemens]] in 1898. He designed Japan's first commercial production plant for [[Calcium carbide]] in [[Sendai]] in 1903. In 1906, two Germans, A.Frank and N. Caro, invented a new method to produce [[calcium cyanamide]] to be used a fertilizer. Noguchi learnt of this invention in a newspaper and realized that the method could be used to utilize the calcium carbide that his plant produced. He went to Germany, and with the support of an acquaintance at Siemens obtained the patent rights, beating other, larger and better-known Japanese trading firms like [[Mitsui]] and [[Furukawa Group|Furukawa]].{{sfn|Odagiri|1996|p=78}}

In 1906, he formed the company Kiso Electric, to develop a [[hydroelectric power]] in [[Kagoshima prefecture]] under contract by local mine owners in [[Kyūshū]]. Since the capacity of the plant he built - 800&amp;nbsp;kW - was in excess of the demand, he established another company, Nippon Carbide Shokai, located in [[Minamata, Kumamoto]], to produce calcium carbide with the surplus electricity in 1907.{{sfn|Odagiri|1996|p=78}}

With financial help from [[Mitsubishi]], Noguchi merged his two companies into ''Nihon Chisso Hiryo'' (lit. "Japan Nitrogenous Fertilizer") in 1908. The name was frequently abbreviated to "Nichitsu". Then, with his collaborator, Fujiyama Tsuneichi, he developed a 'continuous method' of production to replace the 'alternate method' of Frank-Caro's technology. He also produced [[ammonium sulphate]] out of the calcium cyanamide, because it was safer and better known.{{sfn|Odagiri|1996|p=78}} In 1914, he formed "Hiroshima Electric", the forerunner of [[Chugoku Electric Power]] to develop the hydroelectric power potential of the [[Chugoku region]] of Japan.

In 1921 Noguchi bought a new technology for synthetic [[ammonia]] from an Italian, [[Luigi Casale]]. It was still at the stage of a tiny pilot plant when he purchased the license. Again, by their own effort, Nichitsu succeeded in developing a commercially viable plant and selling ammonium sulphate cheaper than the rivals could, thereby dominating the market.  Nichitsu also diversified into the production of [[synthetic fiber]] and [[dynamite]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
In 1922 the German rayon manufacturer [[Vereinigte Glanzstoff-Fabriken]] (VGF) invested in a new Japanese firm in partnership with Noguchi and Asahi Chemicals. The technology was licensed under conditions that prevented competition in VGF's home market, and ensured that VGF would receive the rights to any technical advances made in Japan.{{sfn|Donzé|Nishimura|2013|p=89}}

In 1926, with the collaboration of the Imperial Japanese Army, Noguchi established "Chosen Electric Power" and "Chosen Chisso Hiryo". The former developed Pujon and Chagjin branches of the [[Yalu River]] in northern Korea with a number of huge hudraulic power plants, which supplied a number of huge electrochemical plants, producing a diverse range of products, from fertilizer and explosives to soda and metals.{{sfn|Odagiri|1996|p=79}}

Noguchi suffered from an [[intracranial hemorrhage]] while at [[Seoul]] in 1940, and began to withdraw from active involvement in his conglomerate, which by 1941 had invested 659 million [[Yen]], 66 percent of the fixed capital in the Nichitsu Group, in Korea. Within Korea, 34 percent of all the industrial production in 1939 was made by the Nichisu group.{{sfn|Odagiri|1996|p=79}}  In 1941, Noguchi donated his personal fortune to [[The Korean Scholarship Foundation]], dedicated to building schools, funding scholarships, and raising educational standards in Korea. In 1942, he was awarded the [[Order of the Sacred Treasures]], 1st class. He died in 1944.

[[File:Textilkennzeichnungab.jpg|thumb|right|Label indicating the composition of textiles]]
The '''Textile Labelling Act (Germany)''' ({{lang-de|Textilkennzeichnungsgesetz}} [[Literal translation|Lit]]:"Law on the designation of textiles", short ''TextilKennzG'') is a [[Germany|German]] federal law which was decreed on 1 April 1969. The law was completely rewritten and the new version was announced on 14 August 1986. The law was last changed by decree on 14 November 2006.

This law is part of the German consumer protection. Textiles to be commercially sold in Germany, commercially imported into Germany or produced to be sold in Germany have to have a label indicating the type and fraction based on weight of the textile raw materials it is composed of. Also any catalogue, brochure or other type of commercial have to state the composition of the textiles to be sold. There are certain rules on how to determine the weight fractions and how to calculate them.

Textiles in the context of this law is any good, fabric, part of mattress or camping good, lining of shoes and gloves, floor-covering and many other goods which consist of at least 80% textile raw materials. Textile raw materials are filaments or hairs which can be spun, including bands and flexible tubes not wider than 5mm.

For example, if a [[T-shirt]] consists of 80% [[cotton]] and 20% [[elastane]] this has to be declared on the label of the garment. If the shirt consists of 100% cotton one can choose between "100% cotton" or "completely made of cotton" or "pure cotton". For things made of [[wool]] and [[silk]] there are special regulations. Annex One of the law regulates the denomination of the various filaments.

In Annex Three there is a list of things that do not need a label indicating their composition, such as wristbands for watches, labels, artificial flowers, etc. Annex Four lists products that don't need a label but just an indication of their composition at the site of sale. These are especially things which are traditionally sold per meter like elastic tape.

If one violates the prescription on labelling textiles he can fined up to 5,000.00 [[Euro]]s.

One does not have to declare the country of production on labels. This declaration is optional. Care instructions are printed on labels for liability- and compensation-prevention and are also optional.

'''Thomas Goldie''' (July 9, 1850 &amp;ndash; February 2, 1892) was a businessman and politician in [[Ontario]]. He served as mayor of [[Guelph, Ontario|Guelph]] from 1891 to 1892.

He was born in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], the son of James Goldie and Frances Owen, and came to Guelph with his parents in 1860. His grandfather [[John Goldie (botanist)|John Goldie]] was a botanist. Goldie was educated in Guelph and at [[McGill University|McGill College]] and at [[Eastman Business College|Eastman's National Business College]] in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]]. He entered the family milling business and was also a director of the Guelph Junction Railway and the Gore Fire Insurance Company. He also served as president of the Millers and Manufacturers Insurance Company and as vice-president of the Canadian Millers Mutual Fire Association and the Wellington Mutual Fire Insurance Company. Goldie married Emma Jane Mitchell in 1877. He served on the school board and was a member of the town council from 1881 to 1890. Goldie was also known as a promoter and participant in baseball, lacrosse and cricket. He served as the secretary of the [[Guelph Royals (baseball)|Maple Leaf Base Ball Club]] in Guelph, which won the Canadian championship in 1869 and the United States–Canada championship in 1874. He also was president of the Ontario Cricket Association. He died of [[pneumonia]] in Guelph at the age of 41.

His brother [[Lincoln Goldie|Lincoln]] served in the provincial assembly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1539">'''Variable interest entity (VIE)''' is a term used by the United States [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB) in [[FIN 46]] to refer to an entity (the investee) in which the investor holds a [[controlling interest]] that is not based on the majority of voting rights. It is closely related to the concept of a [[special purpose entity]]. The importance of identifying a VIE is that a company needs to [[consolidation (business)|consolidate]] such entities if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.

Note: The guidance in FIN 46 and FIN 46R was subsequently revised when FASB issued Statement 167.&lt;ref name=ey&gt;{{cite journal|title=FASB issues Statement 167, amendments to FIN 46(R)|journal=[[Ernst &amp; Young]]|date=12 June 2009|volume=No. 2009-22 | url = http://www.ey.com/publication/vwluassetsdld/hottopic_bb1784_consolidation_12june2009/$file/hottopic_bb1784_consolidation_12june2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
A VIE is an entity meeting one of the following three criteria as elaborated in FASB ASC 810-10 [formerly FIN 46 (Revised)]:
* The equity-at-risk is not sufficient to support the entity's activities (e.g.: the entity is thinly [[Financial capital|capitalized]], the group of [[Stock|equity]] holders possess no substantive voting rights, etc.)
* As a group, the equity-at-risk holders cannot control the entity
* The economics do not coincide with the voting interests (commonly known as the "anti-abuse rule")

A '''Viability study''' is an in depth investigation of the [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] of the [[business idea]] to be converted into a business enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Nieuwenhuizen, C., Le Roux, E.E. and Jacobs, H., (2004). Entrepreneurship and how to establish your own business. 2nd Edition, Juta, Pretoria, RSA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feasibility report==
This type of report studies a situation (for example, a problem or opportunity) and the plan for doing something about it, then determines whether that plan is "feasible". This would involve determining whether it is technologically possible to achieve and whether it is practical in the current technological, economical and social scenario. The feasibility report does not provide a simple "Yes" or "No" answer, but is used in the [[analysis]] of a decision. It is not just a tool to provide a recommendation, it is also used to gather data and give reasoning behind the recommendation given, to be later used in evaluation.

This study is the most important especially to people who plan to start their own business.

==Recommendation report==
{{Seealso|SWOT Analysis}}
This type of report examines either a stated need or a selection of choices, or in some cases both. The report is a collection of analysis and evaluation of the situation, and generally will examine the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats in the situation, take them into account, and be combined with the feasibility report in order to give a recommendation. Sometimes a recommendation can be given to do nothing, if all options currently possible would prove unbeneficial. The recommendation report answers the question "Which option should we choose?" (or "Which are the best options?") by allowing a recommendation to be made. This can be linked into the analysis of the [[continuum of choice]] in the scenario.

==Evaluation report==
This type of report provides an opinion or judgment rather that is based on the above two report, along with additional data available. It provides a studied opinion on the value or worth of something. This type of report compares the object of the analysis to a set of requirements (or [[:wikt:criteria|criteria]]) and determines how well it meets those requirements. Generally, the evaluation report will feature an overall recommendation on the course of action to be taken.

'''WCAT''' (1390 [[Hertz|kHz]]) is a [[commercial radio|commercial]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[radio station]] [[City of license|licensed]] to [[Burlington, Vermont]], United States, and serving the [[Burlington, Vermont metropolitan area|Burlington-Plattsburgh area]].  The station is owned by Radio Broadcasting Services, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?call=WCAT |title=WCAT Facility Record |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to FCC records, WCAT's tower #1 is the tallest man-made structure in the state of [[Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fccinfo.com/CMDProASRLookup.php?tabSearchType=ASR+Search&amp;sASR=1042292|title=FCCInfo Structure Registration Results|first=Cavell, Mertz &amp; Associates,|last=Inc.|website=www.fccinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WCAT broadcasts at 5,000 [[watt]]s around the clock, with a non-directional signal by day.  But to protect other stations on [[AM 1390]] at night when AM radio waves travel farther, it uses a [[directional antenna]] after sunset.  WCAT's [[transmitter]] is located off Intervale Road in Burlington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radio-locator.com/info/WCAT-AM|title=WCAT-AM 1390 kHz - Burlington, VT|website=radio-locator.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studios and offices are on Water Tower Circle in [[Colchester, Vermont]].

WCAT also airs on an [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[Broadcast relay station|translator]], '''W252CJ''', at 98.3 [[Hertz|MHz]], to give listeners the option to hear the station in FM stereo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radio-locator.com/info/W252CJ-FX|title=W252CJ-FM 98.3 MHz - Burlington, VT|website=radio-locator.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The station first [[Sign-on|signed on]] as '''WDOT''' on April 19, 1954 on the [[AM 1400]] frequency at 1,000 watts of power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable|Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-216]]&lt;/ref&gt; WDOT was Burlington's [[top-40]] radio station for years and also an [[Network affiliate|affiliate]] of the [[ABC News Radio|ABC Contemporary Radio Network]]. The station later moved to its current frequency,  [[AM 1390]], and was allowed to broadcast with 5,000 watts of power both daytme and nighttime. The station uses a three-tower directional antenna at night to protect 1390 co-channels in [[Syracuse, New York]] ([[WFBL]]), [[Presque Isle, Maine]] ([[WEGP]]), and [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]] ([[WPLM (AM)|WPLM]]).

[[Image:WCAT1390logo.jpg|thumb|left|WCAT's previous logo as an ESPN Radio affiliate]]
The station changed its [[call sign]] to '''WKDR''' on June 1, 1993. The WKDR calls originated on the AM 1070 frequency, licensed to [[Plattsburgh, New York]] (which now operates as [[WPLB (AM)|WPLB]]), and the move benefited WKDR, since its previous position operates only in the daytime, protecting the former 50,000-watt clear channel (1-B) station, [[CBA (AM)|CBA]] in [[Moncton, New Brunswick]].

The station changed its call letters to '''WVAA''' on September 24, 2002, and to the current '''WCAT''' on August 21, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=73613&amp;Callsign=WCAT |title=WCAT Call Sign History |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division }}&lt;/ref&gt;

WCAT, as a [[sports radio]] station, switched affiliations from [[ESPN Radio]] to [[Fox Sports Radio]] on January 1, 2011; the ESPN affiliation has moved to 101.3 [[WCPV]].&lt;ref name="bfp-wcatfox"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Donoghue |newspaper=[[Burlington Free Press]] |title=Fox Sports joins Champlain Valley radio market |url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20101221/NEWS01/12210301/Fox-Sports-joins-Champlain-Valley-radio-market |date=December 21, 2010 |accessdate=December 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through much of 2011, WCAT broadcast a sports talk format in [[simulcast]] with [[sister station]]s [[WRSA (AM)|WRSA]] (1420 AM) and [[WFAD]] (1490 AM) as "Fox Sports Vermont." By the end of the year, it had switched to an [[oldies]] music format simulcast with [[WIFY]] as "Cruisin' 93.7".

On September 1, 2014 WCAT (with sister station WRSA) dropped the simulcast with WIFY and switched to a [[comedy radio]] format. The two stations switched back to oldies in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/community/topic/oldies-back-on-1390-burlington-1420-st-albans/|title=Oldies back on 1390 Burlington &amp; 1420 St. Albans|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early January 2017 WCAT and WRSA both went [[dark (broadcasting)|dark]].  The oldies format relocated to 1070 WPLB, which several months earlier had been sold by WCAT owner Northeast Broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/110312/mid-century-radio-moves-across-lake-champlain/ Mid Century Moves Across Lake Champlain] Radioinsight - January 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

On January 9, 2017, WCAT returned to the air, launching a business news format.
