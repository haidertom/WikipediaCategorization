[[File:Adolfo Calero.jpg|thumb|right|Calero in 1985.]]
'''Adolfo Calero Portocarrero''' (December 22, 1931 &amp;ndash; June 2, 2012) was a [[Nicaraguan]] businessman and the leader of the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]], the largest rebel group of the [[Contras]], opposing the [[Sandinista]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hart Strober | first = Deborah|author2= Gerald S. | title = The Reagan Presidency: An Oral History of the Era | publisher = Brassey's | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-57488-583-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlNorthern Front Contras: The Contra Story — Central Intelligence Agency"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/north.html |title=Northern Front Contras: The Contra Story — Central Intelligence Agency |work= |accessdate=2010-05-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100426224615/https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/north.html| archivedate= 26 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calero was responsible for managing the bank accounts into which money was deposited and then used to buy supplies and arms for the Contras. He was brought to testify at hearings of the [[US Congress]] in May 1987.

==Early years==
Calero was born on December 22, 1931 in Managua to Adolfo Calero Orozco (1899–1980) and María Portocarrero (1911–1944), who had married in 1927. The oldest of four children, he studied in the [[United States]], graduating from [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1953 and [[Syracuse University]]. In Managua, he managed the [[Coca-Cola]] bottling plant.

Calero was associated with the [[Conservative Party of Nicaragua]]. From 1963, he was a [[CIA]] information source. Before the 1979 overthrow of the government of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle|Anastasio Somoza]], he had been briefly imprisoned, which gave credibility to his claims to have opposed Somoza as well as the Sandinistas.

==Contra leader==
In early 1983, he joined the political directorate of the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]] (FDN). By October he became its president, but many observers wondered about his real power because of the political wing's weak control over the military wing. In a bid to unify contra factions and win aid from the [[US Congress]], he became a member of the [[United Nicaraguan Opposition]] (UNO) triumvirate with [[Alfonso Robelo]] and [[Arturo Cruz]].

Calero controlled the FDN through his deputy, [[Aristides Sánchez]], and the contras' military commander, [[Enrique Bermúdez]], an alliance so tight that it was dubbed the "Iron Triangle."

However, there were tensions below the surface. After the Sapoa ceasefire, Calero exploited discontent with Bermudez among the FDN's field commanders in an effort to push him out. Heavy-handed intervention by the CIA helped to crush that effort. Later, however, other commanders, with the blessing of the [[US State Department]], ousted both their political and military leadership.
On July 26, 2011, he published his book "Cronicas de un Contra", which narrates his participation during the 1980s in Nicaragua.

== Personal life ==
Calero married Maria Ernestina Lacayo on December 7, 1957. The couple had two children, Myriam (b. 1958) and Adolfo (1960–1994). Calero has three grandchildren. He had three younger siblings: Myriam (b. 1933-2018) Mario (1935–1993) and Martha (b. 1943).

==Death==
Calero died in Managua on June 2, 2012 after complications from [[pneumonia]] and [[kidney failure]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18312346&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by his wife, daughter, three grandchildren, and two sisters.

==In popular culture==
In the 2017 film ''[[American Made (film)|American Made]]'', he was portrayed by [[Daniel Lugo (actor)|Daniel Lugo]], in a highly innacurate {{Citation needed | reason=How is it innacurate?|date=November 2018}} protrayal of his character and his commitment to Nicaragua's democratization.

The '''Anti-Spyware Coalition''' ('''ASC''') was a group formed in 2005 with the goal to build a consensus about definitions and best practices in the debate surrounding [[spyware]].

Composed of anti-spyware software companies, academics, and consumer groups, the ASC seeks to bring together a diverse array of perspective on the problem of controlling spyware and other potentially unwanted technologies.

==History==

Formed in 2005 after the dissolution of the [[Consortium of Anti-Spyware Technology Vendors]] (COAST) which broke up over internal dissent.&lt;ref&gt;Cowley, Stacy, "Coast antispyware consortium falls apart", IDG News Service,

[https://web.archive.org/web/20150202165524/http://antispywarecoalition.org/documents/ A series of documents] was published, and feedback solicited.  The first set of documents consisted of a definition of spyware and potentially unwanted technologies, and a vendor dispute resolution process.  This was followed by a "Risk Model" providing Anti-Spyware vendors with a framework for classifying software. In March 2007 the ASC published the public final draft of their Best Practices document.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

[[File:New office.jpg|thumb|Back office workers at a company in London]]
A '''back office''' in most [[corporation]]s is where work that supports ''[[front office]]'' work is done. The [[front office]] is the "face" of the company and is all the resources of the company that are used to make sales and interact with customers and clients. The back office is all the resources of the company that are devoted to actually producing a product or service and all the other labor that isn't seen by customers, such as administration or logistics. Broadly speaking, back office work includes roles that affect the costs side of business' [[trading statement]] and front office work includes roles that affect the income side of business' trading statement.

Although the operations of a back office are seldom prominent, they are a major contributor to a business' success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028005437/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?r.s=sl&amp;type=RESOURCES&amp;itemId=1075383691 |title=Maintaining your web content and technology - What are back-office systems? |accessdate=June 25, 2006 |publisher=UK Government Business Link}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can include functions such as [[accounting]], planning, [[inventory management]], [[supply-chain management]], [[human resources]] and logistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://smallbusiness.chron.com/front-office-skills-vs-back-office-skills-32629.html |title=Front Office Skills Vs.

Back offices are often located somewhere other than company [[headquarters]]. Many are in areas and countries with cheaper rent and lower labor costs.  Some [[office park]]s provide back offices for tenants whose front offices are in more expensive neighborhoods. Back office functions can be [[Outsourcing|outsourced]] to consultants and contractors, including ones in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Management Information Systems for the Information Age |edition= 3rd Canadian |author=Haag, S. et al. |publisher=Toronto:McGraw-Hill |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brody Sweeney''' is an [[Irish people|Irish]] businessman, known for founding [[O'Briens Irish Sandwich Bars]] which went into liquidation in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=O'Brien's Sandwiches facing cuts as knives out for food industry  |author=NIAMH HORAN  |newspaper=Irish Independent |date=June 14, 2009 |url=http://www.independent.ie/business/small-business/obriens-sandwiches-facing-cuts-as-knives-out-for-food-industry-1773277.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish business was subsequently bought from the liquidator by Abrakebabra Investments Ltd.

== History ==

The history of [http://www.businessnz.org.nz BusinessNZ] dates back more than 100 years.

In 1902 several regional [[employers' association]]s came together to form the '''New Zealand Employers Federation'''.

The motivation for the formation was to present a unified [[employer]] voice in [[collective bargaining]] and [[labour dispute]]s arbitrated by the [[Employment Court of New Zealand|Arbitration Court]].  While the impetus for its founding was to defend employer interests in bargaining and labour disputes, the Federation emphasised that this did not entail opposition to workers seeking to advance their legitimate interests, and that it supported [[profit-sharing]], [[copartnership|co-partnership]] and the work of labour organisations in working for fair terms and conditions for their members.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Federation was founded for the overall purpose of ongoing advocacy on behalf of business, economic and community wellbeing.

In 1905 the constitution of the Employers Federation of New Zealand was formally adopted.

By 1908 the Federation represented around 6,000 members.

Throughout the Great War (1914-1918), the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, [[World War II]] (1939-1945) and the ensuing post-war boom, the Federation advocated for business, economic and community wellbeing, and worked constructively with all successive governments.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In 1951 the Employers Federation became an incorporated society and by 1971 represented around 10,000 members.

In 2001 the New Zealand Employers Federation merged with the '''New Zealand Manufacturers Federation''' to form Business New Zealand (BusinessNZ),&lt;ref&gt;

The neighborhood is the result of a vast real-estate project launched by the Quebec government in the late 1990s which redeveloped abandoned nineteenth century industrial buildings into a [[business cluster]] for [[information technology]] companies.

[[Aurèle Cardinal|Groupe Cardinal Hardy]] and [[Groupe Provencher &amp; Roy architectes]] collaborated on the district's [[urban design]].&lt;ref name="Multimédia"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chodikoff|first=Ian |date=October 2003|title=Strategic Urbanism |journal=Canadian Architect|publisher=Business Information Group|url=http://www.cdnarchitect.com/issues/ISarticle.asp?aid=1000143711#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Société de Développement de Montréal]] possessed land holdings dating back to the [[Doré]] administration's failed [[Quartier des Récluses]] initiative, in which lands were bought by the [[SIMPA]] to make way for the project. In exchange for handing this over, the SDM gained a minority stake in a joint venture with the real estate arms of the [[Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec]] (CDPQ) and the [[FTQ Fonds de Solidarité]] to fund the construction of the Cité, which occurred in eight phases, with additional phases having been planned. The [[Parti Québécois]] Bouchard Government of Québec then gave payroll tax credits to employers for moving to the new Cité du Multimédia buildings.

After the bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]], and the elimination of tax incentives for information technology jobs in the district by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government of [[Jean Charest]] in 2003, phase 9 and others were cancelled, and the structures were sold by the joint venture to the private sector.

==Economy==
Many high-tech companies are still located in the area, while phase 8 is occupied by the municipal government. The property values in this part of Montreal are very high. The neighbourhood has 6,000 workers, and an average salary of $73,000 per year. This figure is almost 25% above Montréal's average.

==Controversy==
Then-finance minister [[Bernard Landry]] had been criticized by members of Montreal's real-estate community and some high-tech entrepreneurs when Finance Ministry programs enticed companies to relocate to Cité Multimédia and nearby [[Cité du commerce électronique]] in order to receive tax assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Don |last=MacDonald |title=Tax credit targeted at boosting e-business |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/business/story.html?id=58f5e20d-ebeb-46c6-9bf6-5b4933e06f50 |work=Montreal Gazette |publisher=Canwest |accessdate=2008-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Landry announced the creation of [[CDTI]]s located in mid-sized cities throughout [[Quebec]], and later the installation of technology clusters in rural areas, such as the [[Technoparc Rolland]] in [[Sainte-Adèle, Quebec]].

The Cité du Multimédia was also put under investigation in the context of the Charbonneau commission inquiries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lerepublique.com/49210/charbonneau-temoignage-de-gilles-surprenant-luc-leclerc-et-michel-leclerc/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}
'''Consideration''' is a concept of [[English law|English]] [[common law]] and is a necessity for simple contracts but not for special contracts (contracts by [[deed]]). The concept has been adopted by other common law jurisdictions, including the US.

The court in ''Currie v Misa'' &lt;ref&gt;''Currie v Misa''  (1875)  LR 10 Ex 893&lt;/ref&gt; declared consideration to be a “Right,  Interest,  Profit,  Benefit, or Forbearance,  Detriment,  Loss,  Responsibility”. Thus, consideration is a promise of something of value given by a promissor in exchange for something of value given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable '''only''' if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.&lt;ref&gt;''Wade v Simeon'' (1846)  2 CB 548&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''White v Bluett''  (1853)  2 WR 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bronaugh R. (1976). [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2434&amp;context=wmlr Agreement, Mistake, and Objectivity in the Bargain Theory of Conflict]. ''William &amp; Mary Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consideration may be thought of as the concept of value offered and accepted by people or organisations entering into [[contract]]s. Anything of value promised by one party to the other when making a contract can be treated as "consideration": for example, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $5,000, A's consideration is the $5,000, and B's consideration is the car.

Additionally, if A signs a contract with B such that A will paint B's house for $500, A's consideration is the service of painting B's house, and B's consideration is $500 paid to A. Further, if A signs a contract with B such that A will ''not'' repaint his own house in any other color than white, and B will pay A $500 per year to keep this deal up, there is also consideration. Although A did not promise to affirmatively do anything, A did promise ''not'' to do something that he was allowed to do, and so A did pass consideration. A's consideration to B is the ''forbearance'' in painting his own house in a color other than white, and B's consideration to A is $500 per year. Conversely, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $0, B's consideration is still the car, but A is giving no consideration, and so there is no valid contract. However, if B still gives the title to the car to A, then B cannot take the car back, since, while it may not be a valid contract, it ''is'' a valid [[Gift (law)|gift]].

In [[common law]] it is a prerequisite that both parties offer consideration before a contract can be thought of as binding. The doctrine of consideration is irrelevant in many jurisdictions, although contemporary commercial litigant relations have held the relationship between a promise and a deed is a reflection of the nature of contractual considerations. If there is no element of consideration found, there is thus no contract formed.

However, even if a court decides there is no contract, there might be a possible recovery under the doctrines of ''[[quantum meruit]]'' (sometimes referred to as a [[quasi-contract]]) or [[Estoppel#Promissory estoppel|promissory estoppel]].

==Legal rules regarding consideration==
There are a number of common issues as to whether consideration exists in a contract:
# Part payment is not good consideration&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Pinnel's Case]]'' (1602)  5 Co Rep 117a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Jorden v Money]]'' (1854) 5 HLC 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Foakes v Beer]]''  ''([[per incuriam]]?)'' (1884) AC 605&lt;/ref&gt;
# Consideration must move from the promisee but need not flow to the promisor &lt;ref&gt;''[[Tweddle v Atkinson]],, (1861)  1 B&amp;S 393&lt;/ref&gt;
# Consideration must be sufficient but need not be adequate &lt;ref&gt;''[[De la Bere v Pearson]]'' [1908]  1 KB 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chappell v Nestlés]]'' [1960]  AC 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Atlantic Baron]]'' [1979]  QB 705  (aka North Ocean Shipping v Hyundai Construction) &lt;/ref&gt; 
# Consideration cannot be illusory 
# Consideration must not be past. Past consideration is not good consideration &lt;ref&gt;''[[Roscorla v Thomas]]'' 	(1842)  3 QB 234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Re McArdle]]'' 	[1951]  Ch 669&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lampleigh v Braithwaite]]'' 	( 1615) Hob 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kennedy v Broun]]''	 (1863)  13 CB (NS) 677&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Re Casey's Patents]]'' (aka  Stewart v Casey)	[1893] 1 Ch 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pao On v Lau Yiu Long]]'' 	[1980] AC 614 (PC)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Moral consideration is not sufficient&lt;ref&gt;Except for contracts by deed, where "love and affection" is often cited as the (unnecessary) consideration.&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Performance of existing duties is not good consideration &lt;ref&gt;''[[Stilk v Myrick (1809)  2 Camp 317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hartley v Ponsonby]]'' (1857)  7 E&amp;B 872&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Glasbrook Bros v Glamorgan CC]]'' [1925]  AC 270&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Williams v Roffey]]'' [1990] 2 WLR 1153&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and comparative law==
Systems based on Roman law (including Germany &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p1008 German Civil Code § 311], accessed 15 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and Scotland) do not require consideration, and some commentators consider it unnecessary and have suggested that the doctrine of consideration should be abandoned,&lt;ref&gt; See: [[Harvey McGregor]]'s [[Contract Code]]&lt;/ref&gt; and estoppel used to replace it as a basis for contracts.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. P.S. Atiyah, 'Consideration: A Restatement' in ''Essays on Contract'' (1986) p.195, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[legislation]], rather than judicial development, has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine. [[Lord Denning|Lord Justice Denning]] famously stated that "The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind".&lt;ref&gt;[[Central London Property Trust Ltd. v. High Trees House Ltd.]] [1947] KB 130&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason that both exist in common law jurisdictions is thought by leading scholars to be the result of the combining by 19th century judges of two distinct threads: first the consideration requirement was at the heart of the action of [[assumpsit]], which had grown up in medieval times and remained the normal action for breach of a simple contract in England and Wales until 1884, when the old forms of action were abolished; secondly, the notion of agreement between two or more parties as being the essential legal and moral foundation of contract in all legal systems, was promoted by the 18th century French writer Pothier in his ''Traite des Obligations'', much read (especially after translation into English in 1805) by English judges and jurists. The latter chimed well with the fashionable will theories of the time, especially [[John Stuart Mill]]'s influential ideas on free will, and got grafted on to the traditional common law requirement for consideration to ground an action in assumpsit.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed and authoritative account of this process, see [[A. W. B. Simpson]], ''A History of the Common Law of Contract: The Rise of the Action of Assumpsit'', ([[Oxford University Press]]: Oxford, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] systems take the approach that an exchange of promises, or a concurrence of wills alone, rather than an exchange in valuable rights is the correct basis. So if A promises to give B a book, and B accepts the offer without giving anything in return, B would have a legal right to the book and A could not change her mind about giving it to B as a gift. However, in [[common law system]]s the concept of ''[[culpa in contrahendo]]'', a form of [[estoppel]], is increasingly used to create obligations during [[pre-contractual negotiations]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Austotel v Franklins]]'' (1989) 16 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 582&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waltons HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|7|1988|litigants=[[Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher]] |parallelcite=(1988) 164 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 387 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Estoppel is an [[Equity (law)|equitable doctrine]] that provides for the creation of legal obligations if a party has given another an [[wikt:assurance|assurance]] and the other has relied on the assurance to his [[detriment (law)|detriment]].

==Monetary value of consideration==
Generally, courts do not inquire whether the deal between two parties was monetarily fair&amp;mdash;merely that each party passed some legal obligation or duty to the other party.&lt;ref&gt;''Thomas v Thomas'' (1842)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woollen Mills HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|20|1954|litigants=Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth |parallelcite=(1954) 92 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 424 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The dispositive issue is presence of consideration, not adequacy of the consideration. The values between consideration passed by each party to a contract need not be comparable.

For instance, if A offers B $200 to buy B's mansion, luxury sports car, and private jet, there is still consideration on both sides. A's consideration is $200, and B's consideration is the mansion, car, and jet. Courts in the United States generally leave parties to their own contracts, and do not intervene. The old English rule of consideration questioned whether a party gave the ''value of a [[peppercorn (legal)|peppercorn]]'' to the other party. As a result, contracts in the United States have sometimes have had one party pass nominal amounts of consideration, typically citing $1. Thus, licensing contracts that do not involve any money at all often cite as consideration, "for the sum of $1 and other good and valuable consideration."

However, some courts in the United States may take issue with nominal consideration, or consideration with virtually no value. Some courts have since thought this was a sham. Since contract disputes are typically resolved in state court, some state courts have found that merely providing $1 to another is not a sufficiently legal duty, and therefore no legal consideration passes in these kinds of deals, and consequently, no contract is formed. However, this is a minority position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/historical/2004/dec/030109.htm Supreme Court of Texas (1464-EIGHT, LTD. &amp; MILLIS MANAGEMENT CORP, v. GAIL ANN JOPPICH See section III)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-existing legal duties==
{{main article|Pre-existing duty rule}}
A party that ''already'' has a legal duty to provide money, an object, a service, or a forbearance, does not provide consideration when promising merely to uphold that duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Foakes v Beer |year=1884 |court=UKHL |num=1 |courtname=auto}}; See also {{cite AustLII|NSWSC|1390|2010|litigants=Andrew Hennessey v Architectus Group Holdings Pty Ltd |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|court=EWHC |division=KB |year=1809 |num=J58 |litigants=Stilk v Myrick |parallelcite=(1809) 170 ER 1168}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Wigan v Edwards'' (1973) 1 [[Australian Law Reports|ALR]] 497.&lt;/ref&gt; That legal duty can arise from law, or obligation under a previous contract.

The prime example of this sub-issue is where an uncle gives his seven-year-old nephew (a resident of the US) the following offer: "if you do not smoke cigarettes or marijuana until your 18th birthday, then I will pay you $500". On the nephew's 18th birthday, he tells the uncle to pay up, and the uncle says no.  In the subsequent lawsuit, the uncle wins, because the nephew, by U.S. criminal law, already had a duty to refrain from smoking cigarettes while under 18, or marijuana at any age.

The same applies if the consideration is a performance for which the parties had previously contracted. For example, A agrees to paint B's house for $500, but halfway through the job A tells B that he will not finish unless B increases the payment to $750. If B agrees, and A then finishes the job, B still only needs to pay A the $500 originally agreed to, because A was already contractually obligated to paint the house for that amount.

An exception to this rule holds for [[settlement (litigation)|settlement]]s, such as an [[accord and satisfaction]].  If a creditor has a credit against a debtor for $10,000, and offers to settle it for $5,000, it is still binding, if accepted, even though the debtor had a legal duty to repay the entire $10,000.

Pre-existing duties relating to [[at-will employment]] depend largely on state law.  Generally, [[at-will employment]] allows the employer to terminate the employee for good or even no reason, and allows the employee to resign for any reason.  There are no duties of continued employment in the future.  Therefore, when an employee demands a raise, there is no issue with consideration because the employee has no legal duty to continue working.  Similarly, when an employer demands a pay-cut, there is also no contractual issue with consideration, because the employer has no legal duty to continue employing the worker.  However, certain states require additional consideration other than the prospect of continued employment, to enforce terms demanded later by the employer, in particular, non-competition clauses.

==Bundled terms==
Contracts where a legally valueless term is bundled with a term that does have legal value are still generally enforceable.

Consider the uncle's situation above. If the same uncle had instead told his 17-year-old nephew the following offer: "if you do not smoke cigarettes and do not engage females before your 18th birthday, then I will pay you $500".  On the nephew's 18th birthday, he asks the uncle to pay up, and this time, in the subsequent lawsuit, the nephew may win.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Although the promise of not smoking was not valuable consideration (it was already legally prohibited), virtually all states allow some sort of engagement by minors.  Even though the engagement by minors is legally restricted, there are circumstances where it is legal, and thus the promise to forbear from it entirely has legal value.  However, the uncle would still be relieved from the liability if his nephew smoked a cigarette, even though ''that'' consideration is valueless, because it was paired with something of legal value; therefore, adherence to the entire, collective agreement is necessary.

==Past consideration==
Generally, past consideration is not a valid consideration and has no legal value. Past consideration is consideration that has already flowed from the promisee to the promisor. That is, the promisee's act or forbearance predates the promisor's promise. Past consideration therefore cannot be used as a basis when claiming damages.&lt;ref&gt;see {{cite BAILII|court= EWHC |num=J74 |year=1842 |litigants=Roscorla v Thomas |parallelcite=(1842) 114 ER 496}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception to this rule is where there is a duty owed to a third party. 	An act done before the giving of a promise to make a payment or to confer some other benefit can sometimes be consideration for the promise. For this to hold, three conditions must be satisfied (Pao On v Lau Yiu Long [1980]):

# The act must have been done at the promisor’s request
# The parties must have understood the act was to be remunerated either by a payment or the conferment of some other benefit 
# Payment/conferment of the benefit must have been legally enforceable had it been promised in advance

==Option contracts and conditional consideration==
Generally, conditional consideration is valid consideration.

Suppose A is a movie script writer and B runs a movie production company.  A says to B, "buy my script." B says "How about this – I will pay you $5,000 so that you do not let anyone else produce your movie until one year from now.  If I do produce your movie in that year, then I will give you another $50,000, and no one else can produce it.  If I do not produce your movie in that year, then you're free to go."  If the two subsequently get into a dispute, the issue of whether a contract exists is answered.  B had an option contract—he could decide to produce the script, or not. B's consideration passed was the $5,000 down, and the possibility of $50,000.  A's consideration passed was the exclusive rights to the movie script for at least one year.

==In settlements==

Suppose B commits a [[tort]] against A, causing $5,000 in [[compensatory damages]] and $3,000 in [[punitive damages]].  Since there is no guarantee that A would win against B if it went to court, A may agree to drop the case if B pays the $5,000 compensatory damages.  This is sufficient consideration, since B's consideration is a guaranteed recovery, and A's consideration is that B only has to pay $5,000, instead of $8,000.

'''Curt René Nicolin''' (10 March 1921 – 8 September 2006) was a Swedish businessman. He served as the chairman of [[ASEA]] and the [[Swedish Employers Association]].&lt;ref name="Sydsvenskanobit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/2006-09-14/curt-nicolin-dod |newspaper=[[Sydsvenskan]] |title=Curt Nicolin död |last1=Magnusson |first1=Erik |date=14 September 2006 |accessdate=20 February 2017 |language=Sewdish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Nicolin was born in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, the son of Felix Nicolin and his wife Anna Lisa (née Rehné).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2422">The [[U.S. Department of Defense]]'s '''Foreign Military Sales''' ('''FMS''') program facilitates sales of U.S. arms, defense equipment, defense services, and military training to foreign governments. The purchaser does not deal directly with the [[defense contractor]]; instead, the [[Defense Security Cooperation Agency]] serves as an intermediary, usually handling procurement, logistics and delivery and often providing product support, training, and infrastructure construction (such as hangars, runways, utilities, etc.). The [[Defense Contract Management Agency]] often accepts FMS equipment on behalf of the [[US government]].

FMS is based on countries being authorized to participate, cases as the mechanism to procure services, and a deposit in a US Trust Fund or appropriate credit and approval to fund services.

Some [[U.S. Air Force]] FMS programs are assigned two-word [[code name|codename]]s beginning with the word PEACE, indicating oversight by USAF Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/codenames.html|title=U.S. Military Code Names|work=designation-systems.net|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second word in these codenames is often chosen to reflect some facet of the customer, such as MARBLE for Israel or ONYX for Turkey. Codenames appear in all capital letters.

No partner nation has yet succeeded in applying strict schedule clauses to a FMS program.&lt;ref&gt;Tae-hoon, Lee. [http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/03/205_106346.html "Seoul fears delivery delays of F-35 jets."] ''Korea Times''. March 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=November 2014}}

Franz Colruyt was the second son in a family of 11 children. His father Joseph was a baker and had a store under the church tower of Lembeek (a borough of [[Halle,_Belgium|Halle]]). After his death, his son [[Jo Colruyt]] took over the company. 

==Career==
Franz Colruyt started working with his father and delivered food to stores and large consumers. In 1928, Franz Colruyt decided to shut down the bakery and start up a wholesale business in colonial goods, such as coffee and spices. Until the war, the wholesale business mainly serves stores around Halle and [[Tubize|Tubeke]]. 

After WW2, the business booms and new customers are found in and around [[Brussels]]. Franz Colruyt also starts bottling wine and roasting coffee. The family business grows into a food wholesaler. 

In 1950, Franz Colruyt founds the "Etablissementen Franz Colruyt nv" with a capital of 5 million francs (€ 125,000). His brothers Henri and Jules are also part of the business. 

In the 1950s, the first mini-supermarkets and supermarkets open in Belgium. As a reaction to this, Franz Colruyt opens the Boni stores. These are run by independent shopkeepers that buy goods from Colruyt. 

In 1958, his son Jo Colruyt takes over the company with his brothers. At that time, the company is already delivering to about 800 small independent stores and has about 150 employees. 

==Personal==
Franz Colruyt had a lot of attention for matters such as work simplification, efficiency, simplicity and working with production lines. This was also a necessity. He started his business during a crisis year. He concluded that low prices and low costs could help the company.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2714">'''Frederick Charles Mow Fung''', alias '''Chung Yau Tak Mow Fung''', was an [[Australian Chinese]] merchant in Hong Kong.

==Biography==
He began to live in Hong Kong from around 1895 and became one of the prominent residents in the colony. He was the partner of the Mow Fung &amp; Company Limited. He was responsible for the formation and organisation of the war time Police Reserve. He was also appointed Assistant Superintendent of Police in command of the Chinese Company when the Police Reserve was formed in 1927. He was also responsible for the formation of the Chinese Special Constabulary which helped to government to maintain order during the [[Canton–Hong Kong strike]] in 1925.&lt;ref name="election"&gt;{{cite news|title=SANITARY BOARD ELECTION.|page=8|date=20 April 1932|newspaper=The China Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

F. C. Mow Fung was a Director of the [[Kwong Wah Hospital]] between 1925 and 1926. He was also member of the General Committee of the [[Kowloon Residents' Association]] and was elected Vice-President in 1929 and 1930 and President of the Association in March 1931, replacing Rev. J. Horace Johnston of the [[St. Andrew's Church (Kowloon)|St. Andrew's Church]].&lt;ref name="election"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KOWLOON RESIDENTS' ASSOCIATION.|page=6|date=10 March 1931|newspaper=Hong Kong Daily Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

F. C. Mow Fung ran for the [[Hong Kong sanitary board election, May 1932|Sanitary Board election]] in May 1932 against Dr. [[Li Shu Fan]], which made it one of the few contested Sanitary Board elections in history. Mow Fung was nominated by the then President of the Kowloon Residents' Association W. Walton Rogers and seconded by E. Cook, the past President of the Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rogers|first=W. Walton|title=Sanitary Board Election|newspaper=Hong Kong Daily Press|date=3 May 1932|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Vote for your candidate|newspaper=Hong Kong Daily Press|date=10 May 1932|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mow Fung had been sued for occasions. In 1925 he was sued for wrongfully quarrying and removing granite from a group of Chinese contractors' land at [[Kowloon City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TRESPASSING IN IGNORANCE.|page=3|date=3 June 1925|newspaper=The Hong Kong Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 he was sued for a transaction of property during the wartime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wartime Property Transaction: Mr Fred Mow Fung As Defendant.|date=1 October 1948|page=5|newspaper=The Hong Kong Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UEFA===
Gianni Infantino started working with the [[UEFA]] in August 2000, and was appointed as the Director of UEFA's Legal Affairs and Club Licensing Division in January 2004. He became Deputy General Secretary of UEFA in 2007, and Secretary General of UEFA in October 2009.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uefa.org/about-uefa/news/newsid=2299017.html|title=UEFA Executive Committee supports UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino for FIFA presidency|website=UEFA.com|access-date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time there, UEFA introduced Financial Fair Play and improved commercial support to smaller national associations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

He oversaw the expansion of [[UEFA Euro 2016]] to 24 teams&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/sports/soccer/gianni-infantino-fifa-president-election.html|title=In FIFA Pitch, Gianni Infantino Pushes Expansion and Continuity|last=Borden|first=Sam|date=2016-02-24|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played a role in the conception of the [[UEFA Nations League]] and the [[UEFA Euro 2020]], that will take place in 13 European nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro-2020/news/newsid=1913839.html|title=Thirteen cities to host UEFA EURO 2020|last=|website=UEFA.com|access-date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Greek government]] decided to introduce a new sports law in response to the recent [[2015 Greek football scandal|scandal]] and acts of violence and corruption mainly in [[Football in Greece|Greek football]]. Gianni Infantino, as [[UEFA]]'s general secretary, led the negotiations with the Greek government and supported the [[Hellenic Football Federation]]'s warning to Greece that it faces suspension from international football for government interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thetoc.gr/eng/news/article/uefa--fifa-warn-greece-over-governments-planned-new-football-laws|title=UEFA &amp; FIFA warn Greece over government's planned new football laws {{!}}thetoc.gr|website=The TOC In English|language=en-US|access-date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insideworldfootball.com/world-football/europe/16938-exclusive-infantino-fires-second-warning-shot-to-greece-over-football-law-proposal|title=Exclusive: Infantino fires second warning shot to Greece over football law proposal - Inside World Football|last=Nicholson|first=Paul|website=www.insideworldfootball.com|access-date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, he confirmed his candidacy and submitted the required declarations of support.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uefa.org/about-uefa/news/newsid=2299067.html|title=Statement from UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino|last=|website=UEFA.com|access-date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He promised to expand the [[FIFA World Cup]] to forty teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/10/gianni-infantino-fifa-election-world-cup-40-teams|title=Gianni Infantino to expand World Cup to 40 teams if elected Fifa president|last=Associated Press|first=|date=2015-11-10|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 26 February 2016, he was elected FIFA President for a period of three years.&lt;ref name="FIFA_president"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2016/m=2/news=gianni-infantino-elected-fifa-president-2767180.html|title=Gianni Infantino elected FIFA President|publisher=FIFA.com|date=26 February 2016|access-date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss man Infantino holds dual citizenship through his parents. With his election, he became the first Italian to hold the Presidency of FIFA.

In 2017, Infantino criticized the United States [[Trump travel ban|travel ban]] on several [[Muslim world|Muslim]]-majority nations. He said "When it comes to FIFA competitions, any team, including the supporters and officials of that team, who qualify for a World Cup need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup. That is obvious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Donald Trump travel ban could prevent USA from hosting 2026 World Cup |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/donald-trump-travel-ban-usa-world-cup-2026-world-cup-hosts-a7620916.html |work=The Independent |date=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the start of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Infantino stated in February of that year that he is "very satisfied so far with the progress in Russia. I’m sure we’ll have a great World Cup there – not only a great World Cup but the best World Cup ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gianni Infantino satisfied with Russia’s World Cup preparations |url=http://www.winworldcup.com/en/gianni-infantino-satisfied-russias-world-cup-preparations/ |work=Win World Cup 2018 |date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panama Papers===
{{see also|Panama Papers}}
Infantino was implicated in the FIFA corruption scandal in documents released in the 2016 Panama Papers. They show that the UEFA undertook deals with indicted figures where previously they had denied any relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/05/panama-papers-pull-fifa-uefa-chief-gianni-infantino-corruption-scandal|title=Panama Papers: Fifa president Gianni Infantino pulled into corruption scandal|author=Owen Gibson|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infantino has stated he is "dismayed" at the reports and that he has never personally dealt with the parties involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2016/m=4/news=statement-from-fifa-president-gianni-infantino-2779887.html|title=Statement from FIFA President Gianni Infantino|date=5 April 2016|work=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== FIFA ethics investigations ==
In July 2016, Infantino was suspected to have broken the FIFA code of ethics, and was interviewed by the investigatory chamber of the [[FIFA Ethics Committee]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36795446|title=Fifa president Gianni Infantino to be interviewed by ethics committee|date=2016-07-14|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The investigation was focused on three areas: "several flights taken by Mr. Infantino during the first months of his presidency, human resources matters related to hiring processes in the president's office, and Mr. Infantino's refusal to sign the contract specifying his employment relationship with FIFA".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/gianni-infantino-fifa-president-cleared-following-ethics-committee-investigation-a7173616.html|title=Fifa president Gianni Infantino cleared of breaching ethics code|date=2016-08-05|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Even though a document was leaked which showed illegitimate spending of funds by FIFA&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the matter concerning expenses and governance was not investigated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The document revealed that Infantino had billed FIFA for personal expenses such as £8,795 for [[mattress]]es at his home, £6,829 for a stepper exercise machine, £1,086 for a [[tuxedo]], £677 on flowers and £132 on personal laundry. In addition to that he billed the FIFA governing body for an external driver for his family and advisors while he was away.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

When Infantino accepted special treatment by the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosts [[Russia]] and [[Qatar]], the question of a potential [[conflict of interest]] was raised. The hosts had organized private jets for Infantino and his staff related to visits in Russia and the Gulf state.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The investigatory chamber was of the opinion that no violation had occurred. In addition to that, the chamber found that "human resources matters, as well as Mr. Infantino's conduct with regard to his contract with FIFA, if at all, constituted internal compliance issues rather than an ethical matter."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

While the investigatory chamber discharged Infantino, this did not stop criticism. [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]], a former German football champion, criticized Infantino for not fulfilling his promises regarding transparency, democracy and governance. "So far this has not succeeded in my eyes," he complained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insideworldfootball.com/2017/03/01/german-power-players-rummenigge-grindel-slam-infantino-presidency/|title=German power players Rummenigge and Grindel slam Infantino presidency|date=2017-03-01|website=Inside World Football|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Infantino is married to Lebanese Leena Al Ashqar; the couple have four children (Alessia, Sabrina, Shanïa Serena and Dhalia Nora).&lt;ref name="fifapresprofile"/&gt; He is a fan of the Italian [[Serie A]] club [[Inter Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/26-02-2016/infantino-presidente-fifa-ecco-ex-re-sorteggi-che-amava-altobelli-140804290327.shtml|title=Infantino presidente Fifa: ecco l'ex re dei sorteggi che amava Altobelli|trans-title=Infantino FIFA president: here is the ex-king of draws who loved Altobelli|language=it|website=Gazzetta.it|access-date = 27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Gilbert "Gil" Simpson''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|KNZM|QSM}} (born 1948) is a New Zealand businessman and computer programmer.

==Early life==
Simpson was born in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, and raised in the Waikato. He attended high school in Christchurch and in 1967 began his career as a computer programmer, at age 18.

==Career==
In 1969 he wrote the initial direct debit and direct credit applications which are in common use throughout the New Zealand banking industry today. By age 22 he was Head of Computer Programming at the [[New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Limited|Comalco aluminium smelter]] in [[Bluff, New Zealand|Bluff]], which at that time was the largest industrial project ever undertaken in New Zealand.

He returned to Christchurch around 1972, making it his home permanently.  He lived in [[Jeddah]], Saudi Arabia, working as a programmer for [[Caterpillar Inc.]] between 1976 and 1978, after which he returned to New Zealand to develop a new concept in computer programming through his creation of the fourth generation language [[LINC 4GL|LINC]], New Zealand's most successful software export to date. He has resided in Christchurch ever since, where there is now a street named after him ''Sir Gil Simpson Drive''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.co.nz/maps/place/Sir+Gil+Simpson+Dr,+Burnside,+Christchurch+8053/@-43.491915,172.5575365,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6d31f4ca99f265e9:0xfb466944900cb569!8m2!3d-43.491915!4d172.5597252?hl=en-GB/ |title=Google Maps |website=Google.co.nz |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently he founded Jolly Good Software Pty Ltd in 2006 [http://www.jollygood.co.nz].

'''Inclusive capitalism''' is a term composed of two complementary meanings: (1) poverty is a significant, systemic problem in countries which have already embraced or are transitioning towards capitalistic economies, and (2) companies and non-governmental organizations can sell goods and services to low-income people, which may lead to targeted [[poverty alleviation]] strategies, including improving people’s nutrition, health care, education, employment and environment, but not their [[political power]].

== History ==
Inclusive capitalism originates with philosophical questions that predate modern day [[capitalism]]. These questions regard people’s motivation. Are people motivated by what is best for their own self-interest, for the good of society or perhaps somewhere in between? Different philosophers have advanced their own ideas about these questions, including [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679). Hobbes thought “[m]an was motivated by his appetites, desires, fear and self-interest, seeking pleasure and avoiding pain […] His main desire, and the most important of natural laws, was self-preservation and the avoidance of death” (Curtis 1981:327). Hobbes’ assertion would become the foundation for capitalism, which espouses an exclusive rather than inclusive nature of people.

Hobbes’ ideas influenced [[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790) who thought governments should not repress people’s self-interest in the economy. “Smith never suggests that they [people] are motivated only by self-interest; he simply states that self-interest motivates more powerfully and consistently than kindness, [[altruism]], or [[martyrdom]]” (Buchholz 1989:21). In the 17th and 18th centuries notions of [[morality]] ([[theology]]) and [[Value (economics)|value]] ([[economics]]) separate, leading Smith to advance a new theory of value based on divisions of labor rather than value being defined in a religious context of working for God (Wilk and Cliggett 2007:50-51). For Smith "value cannot be measured by money, because sometimes money is artificially scarce [...] because all labor is of equal value to the worker, labor is the best measure of value" (Wilk and Cliggett 2007:51-52). Thus the concept of capitalism is rooted in an idea of [[human nature]] being inherently self-interested and the value of goods and services are derived from labor.

[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) critiqued capitalism by analyzing the [[division of labor]] in Europe from an historical perspective. He argued that people’s human nature, more specifically their ideas “were largely a product of class, economic structures and social positions. Ideas justified or rationalized the economic structure at any one time – they did not cause that structure” (Wilk and Cliggett 2007:97). Marx concluded that the division of labor contributes to perpetual inequality between the masses of low-income workers ([[proletariat]]) whose numbers are far greater and wealth far less than the minority and more powerful upper class ([[bourgeoisie]]) who are often politicians and business owners (Marx and Engels 1970). Marx’s historical perspective focused on the role of politics in contributing towards and legitimizing modes of production that created separate socioeconomic classes. 

“The division of labour inside a nation leads at first to the separation of industrial and commercial from agricultural labor, and hence to the separation of town and country and to conflict of their interests” (Marx and Engels 1970:43). The term “town” in this sense can be understood as the centers of political power and economic decision-making and the people who live in towns possess comparatively more power than those working in the countryside. According to Marx, those with the most power are included in the benefits of capitalism and those with less power are excluded from such benefits.

[[Karl Polanyi]] (1886–1964) used a more cross-cultural approach to understanding different types of economies, including those based on capitalism. He began by describing the term "economic" as a combination of two separate meanings. The first is a "substantive meaning" that refers to the relationship humans have with one another and to the earth. The second is a "formal meaning" that deals with a "means-ends relationship" which focuses on economizing one's means to [[maximize]] one's ends (a "logical" and mechanistic understanding of what it means to be a human and participate in an economy) (Polanyi 1957:243). Polanyi charts how [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], [[Redistribution (economics)|redistribution]] and [[Trade|exchange]] have been conducted in different cultures across time (Polanyi 1957:250-56). Polanyi concluded that in some cultures economic transactions involve deep human relationships and rely on decision-making for environmental preservation and social cohesion. In others cultures, economies serve more of a function or utility of increasing capital where transactions are based less on the aim of social cohesion and environmental well being. The contemporary use of the term “inclusive capitalism” arises from the historical understanding of the essence of human nature and its role in economic decision-making.

== Contemporary understanding ==
It is inconclusive who coined the term “inclusive capitalism.” Using different electronic databases to query this term (e.g. [[JSTOR]], OCLC Academic, [[Web of Science]], [[Google Scholar]], etc.) a Google Book search identified one of the oldest occurrences of the term appears in a 1943 Urban Land Institute publication (Urban Land 1943).{{or|date=June 2014}} Two contemporary scholars who have popularized the term individually and through collaborative publications are [[C.K. Prahalad]] and Allen Hammond. 

C.K. Prahalad is the Paul and Ruth McCracken Distinguished University Professor of [[Strategy]] at the [[Ross School of Business]] in [[Michigan]]. Prahalad opens his 2005 book ''The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits'' by asking “Why can’t we create inclusive capitalism” (Prahalad 2005:xv). He uses the term “inclusive capitalism” to invite readers to “commence talking about underserved consumers and markets. The process must start with [[Bottom of the Pyramid]] consumers as individuals […] New and creative approaches are needed to convert poverty into an opportunity for all concerned. That is the challenge” (Prahalad 2005:xvii). The inside cover of the book asserts that Prahalad coined the term “Bottom of the Pyramid” whereby the pyramid represents capitalism and those benefiting from it are the majority of people at the bottom who are all poor. 

Allen Hammond is Vice President of Special Projects and Innovation at the [[World Resources Institute]]: a Washington, DC-based, non-profit, environmental, [[think tank]] created in 1982 through a $15 million donation by the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]] of Chicago (World Resources Institute website 2008). One of Hammond’s earliest publications that discusses the idea of inclusive capitalism without explicitly mentioning the term is a 2001 article titled ''Digitally Empowered Development'' published in the journal ''[[Foreign Affairs]]''. 

In the article, Hammond describes how [[technology]] in the 1990s has led many people to experience greater wealth and allowed for their overall quality of life to improve. He also notes that billions of people continue to live in [[poverty]] in countries developing their capitalistic society. In order to address this exclusiveness of capitalism a new capitalistic model should be used, argues Hammond. “What is needed instead is a [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Management and organization|bottom-up]] model that makes credit, communications, information, energy sources, and other self-help tools […] The idea behind this new development model is that basic services should generally be provided by businesses -- sometimes directly, sometimes in partnership with governments or networks of non-governmental organizations ([[NGO]]s)” (Hammond 2001:98). [[Privatizing]] [[public services]] is a central idea of inclusive capitalism, suggesting government policies have largely failed poor people and businesses and non-governmental organizations should assume a greater role in poverty alleviation.

Prahalad and Hammond co-published a 2002 article in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' that advanced their ideas of using market-based solutions for poverty alleviation through a hypothetical case study of development in India (Prahalad and Hammond 2002). In 2004, they advanced their ideas in another co-authored publication, this time highlighting three misconceptions of poor people commonly held by companies. The first is that poor people have little buying power when in fact “low-income households collectively possess most of the buying power in many developing countries” (Hammond and Prahalad 2004:32). The second is that low-income people do not like change when in fact they often receive little opportunity to choose among a variety of products and services. The third is little money can be made by selling to the poor. The “world's poor-families with an annual [[household income]] of less than $6,000-is enormous. The 18 largest emerging and transition countries include 680 million such households, with a total annual income of $1.7 trillion-roughly equal to Germany's annual [[gross domestic product]]” (Hammond and Prahalad 2004:32).

== Critique ==
A critique of the ideas behind inclusive capitalism begins where Hammond and Prahalad end: “Blocs of poor consumers increasingly have the power to reject what a [[multinational corporation]] wants to buy or sell; via their governments, they can also empower a non-traditional competitor” (Hammond and Prahalad 2004:37). Inclusive capitalism as used by Hammond and Prahalad divorces political power from economic empowerment. It is not concerned with improving poor people’s political condition, allowing those in poverty to have greater political control and representation in government. It does not endorse [[macroeconomic]] changes through government policies that ensure higher wages, equitable access to housing, education, nutrition and health care across socioeconomic classes, particularly for poor people. Inclusive capitalism maintains political accountability in contributing to poverty is limited to not doing enough to encourage private enterprise (1) to create more jobs for low-income people; (2) to allow poor people access to financial capital for entrepreneurialism, (3) to enable poor people the opportunity to purchase a variety of goods and services. No consideration is given to governments and companies that benefit from having low-income and poorly educated populations who provide necessary labor.

In 2007, Hammond and a team of researchers from the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the [[World Bank Group]]’s [[International Finance Corporation]] and the World Resource Institute concluded that poverty afflicts four billion people worldwide, many of whom are living in capitalistic countries or countries transitioning towards capitalism (Hammond et al. 2007). Poverty is defined as “those with incomes below $3,000 in local [[purchasing power]]” (Hammond et al. 2007:3). Based on this evidence, the lived experiences of most human beings is that they are living in countries practicing different degrees of capitalism, which has proven itself to be highly exclusive. The opening pages of the 2007 report by Hammond et al. reveal additional funding for the report came from [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and [[Visa International]]. This suggests that [[crony capitalism]] and inclusive capitalism may have overlapping interests. 

An alternative understanding of capitalism and how to make it more inclusive is offered by [[anthropologists]], historians, medical doctors, and [[sociologists]] (Davis [2006], Farmer 2003, Goode and Maskovsky 2001, O’Connor 2001 and Yelvington [1995]). These social and medical scientists use [[ethnography]], economic data and political history to document intentional public policies supported by business interests to maintain the [[status quo]] of low-income populations. Governments and businesses [[collude]] to prevent low-income populations with access to affordable housing, health care, education and nutrition because they divert resources to maximizing profits from middle- and upper-income populations. Making capitalism more inclusive certainly includes Hammond’s and Prahalad’s suggestions of encouraging companies to sell goods to poor people at affordable prices. However, inclusive capitalism must address political considerations that maintain structural inequalities within any economy.

Hammond and Prahalad champion [[information and communication technologies]] (ICTs), such as cell phones, computers and the Internet as powerful tools for poverty alleviation. Ethnographic data from anthropologists and sociologists reveal widely available and affordable ICTs provide [[qualitative property|qualitative]] improvement in the lives of low-income people, but not [[quantitatively]] improve their livelihood and wealth (Slater and Tacchi 2004 and Horst and Miller 2006). The research of these anthropologists and sociologists indicates that measurable improvement in poor people’s lives is not likely to occur without comprehensive government policies that simultaneously encourage living wages, affordable housing, access to nutritious and low-cost food, high quality and inexpensive schooling, health care and public transportation. While these public policies may be delivered by businesses and NGOs, government oversight does not need to be removed for a more inclusive capitalistic economy.

'''indecs'''&lt;ref&gt;http://cordis.europa.eu/econtent/mmrcs/indecs.htm&lt;/ref&gt; (an acronym of "[[interoperability]] of data in [[e-commerce]] systems"; written in lower case) was a project partly funded by the [[European Community]] ''Info 2000'' initiative and by several organisations representing the music, rights, text publishing, authors, library and other sectors in 1998-2000, which has since been used in a number of [[metadata]] activities.  A final report and related documents were published; the indecs Metadata Framework document&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doi.org/topics/indecs/indecs_framework_2000.pdf "Principles, model and data dictionary"&lt;/ref&gt; is a concise summary.

indecs provided an analysis of the requirements for metadata for e-commerce of [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] ([[intellectual property]]) in the network environment, focusing on [[semantic interoperability]].  Semantic interoperability deals with the question of how one computer system knows what the terms from another computer system mean (e.g. if A says "owner" and B says "owner", are they referring to the same thing?  If A says "released" and B says "disseminated", do they mean different things?).

indecs was built from a simple generic model of commerce (the "model of making"): a model of the [[Product life cycle management|life cycle]] of any kind of content from conception to the final physical or [[digital copies]].   The top-level model is summarised as  "people make stuff; people use stuff; and (for commerce to take place) people make deals about the stuff".  If secure machine-to-machine management of [[commerce]] is to be possible, the stuff, the people and the deals must all be securely identified and described in standardised ways that machines can interpret and use.  Central to the analysis is the assumption that it is possible to produce a generic mechanism to handle complex metadata for all different types of content. So, for example, instead of treating sound carriers, books, videos and photographs as fundamentally different things with different (if similar) characteristics, they are all recognised as creations with different values of the same higher-level attributes, whose metadata can be supported in a common environment.

==Framework==

The indecs analysis supports interoperability of at least five different types:

* Across [[Media (communication)|media]] (such as books, serials, audio, [[audiovisual]], software, abstract works, visual material).
* Across functions (such as [[cataloging]], discovery, workflow and [[rights management]]).
* Across levels of metadata (from simple to complex).
* Across semantic barriers. 
* Across [[linguistic barrier]]s.

The indecs project developed a framework, described in detail in the final project documents, within which such interoperability could be achieved.   indecs proposed four principles as key to the management of identification:

* ''The principle of Unique Identification:'' every entity should be [[unique identifier|uniquely identified]] within an identified namespace.
* ''The principle of Functional Granularity:'' it should be possible to identify an entity whenever it needs to be distinguished
* ''The principle of Designated Authority:'' the author of an item of metadata should be securely identified.
* ''The principle of Appropriate Access:'' everyone requires access to the metadata on which they depend, and privacy and confidentiality for their own metadata from those who are not dependent on it.

indecs also produced a definition of metadata:
* An item of metadata is a [[semantic relationship|relationship]] that someone claims to exist between two referents (entities).

The indecs framework stresses the significance of relationships, which lie at the heart of the indecs analysis. It underlines the importance of unique identification of all entities (since otherwise expressing relationships between them is of little practical utility). Finally, it raises the question of authority: the identification of the person making the claim is as significant as the identification of any other entity.

(Note: describing metadata as linking two referents may seem unusual: the point is that an unambiguous piece of metadata has to relate to precise enough things - referents - at each end of the link (e.g. my CAR is GREEN) to make a useful statement. "Precise enough" is contextual.  "Green" might be a perfectly precise enough referent if the namespace it's coming from (where we are referring to, and the application we are interested in) is dealing with "what colour is your car: green, red, blue, black, or white...?"; but not if it's intended to describe precisely a green colour to a garage to respray your car following an accident, when you would need to say e.g. "Ford Colour ref 3456/2009 Metallic Green".)

The underlying assumptions or axioms of the indecs approach are (1) Metadata is critical; (2) Stuff is complex; (3): Metadata is modular; and (4) Transactions need automation.

== Use ==

The indecs Framework does not presuppose any specific business model or legal framework; it can be used to describe transactions of copyrighted, open source, or freely available material.

The framework has been developed further as a generic [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]]-based approach dealing with defined types of entity and attribute, and the relators that link them within a contextual model structure (where context is defined as an intersection of ''time'' and ''place'', in which ''entities'' may play roles).  Its main use to date has been in applications of commercial transactions of content and in some library-related applications.  Examples of applications using this approach include:
* [https://dx.doi.org/10.1045/january2007-dunsire RDA/ONIX Framework for Resource Categorization]
* [http://iso21000-6.net ISO/IEC 21000-6]] ([[MPEG]]) Rights Data Dictionary (RDD)
* [http://www.ddex.net DDEX (Digital Data Exchange)] Music industry messaging and data dictionary applications
* [http://www.editeur.org/onix.html ONIX] ([[Online Information Exchange]]) standards for the use of publishers in distributing digital metadata about their products
* [http://www.doi.org/ DOI] [[Digital Object Identifier]] System metadata schemes

One of the deliverables of the indecs project was a specification for a Directory of Parties.  This led to a subsequent project, Interparty,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interparty.org&lt;/ref&gt; funded under the European Commission's Information Society Technologies Programme, to design and specify a network to support interoperability of party identification (for both natural and corporate names) across different domains, building on the indecs principles. InterParty was not proposed as a replacement for existing schemes for the identification of participants in the intellectual property domain (e.g. national library name authority files or systems oriented towards the needs of rights licensing) but as a means of effecting their interoperation. Some of its conclusions have been used elsewhere, e.g. in the work on the proposed ISO ISNI&lt;ref&gt;http://isni.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (International Standard Name Identifier).

Other developments are continuing, notably through the OntologyX semantic engineering tools and services from [http://www.rightscom.com Rightscom].  The approach also has much in common with the [http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/index.html CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM)], an ontology for cultural heritage information, and the [[Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records]] (FRBR) model in the library world.

In June 2009 a new initiative, the [http://cdlr.strath.ac.uk/VMF/ Vocabulary Mapping Framework (VMF)], was announced by a consortium of partners.   Funded by [http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/projects/vocab-framework.aspx JISC], in Nov 2009 this delivered (as the first phase of an ongoing program of work) an extensive and authoritative mapping of vocabularies from nine major content [[metadata standards]], creating a downloadable tool to support interoperability across communities.  The mapping is also extensible to other standards.   The work builds on the principles of interoperability established in the indecs Content Model, and is an expansion of the existing [https://dx.doi.org/10.1045/january2007-dunsire RDA/ONIX Framework for Resource Categorization] into a comprehensive vocabulary of resource relators and categories, which will be a superset of those used in major standards from the publisher/producer, education and bibliographic/heritage communities.  The [[International DOI Foundation]], which fully endorses this work, is to provide a web hosting facility for the Framework as part of its commitment to promoting the wider use of interoperable metadata, and will use the vocabulary mapping wherever possible to support the association of metadata with DOI names &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doi.org/news/DOINewsJun09.html#1''DOI News: Launch of “Vocabulary Mapping Framework”]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellectual property rights ==

Indecs uses one common underlying structure which may be considered in three views: the general view; the commerce view; and the intellectual property (legal) view. An intellectual property right is a legal concept, with terms defined in a series of international conventions and treaties and under national law.  The precise characteristics by which recognition of intellectual property rights is secured are elusive and are settled by editorial, commercial or, ultimately, by a legal judgement.  Indecs does not attempt to replace such legal considerations, though a specific set of legal elements might be included in an indecs-based structure, and the indecs framework specifically includes some definitions from major international treaties such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] and the [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]].

== Mapping of terms ==

Different models of the life cycle of content may have important differences, not least in the specific meaning attached to the names of terms they employ. FRBR, indecs and CRM were each informed by different functional requirements, and so evolved different mechanisms for dealing with the issues that seemed most important to them. Each is a particular view on the "universe of discourse" of resources and relationships: there are many valid views.  Broadly, they are compatible, and effective integration of metadata from schemes based on them should be achievable, but they must be handled with care.  As an example: the terms abstraction, manifestation, item and expression are often used in considering content life cycles (e.g. a [[sound recording]] is the expression of a musical work during a recording session at a particular place and time, and is distinct from, say, the master tape made, which is a manifestation).  These were dealt with in indecs, but may have slightly different meanings in other schemes. Such an analysis of meaning of a term from a scheme is possible in indecs by mapping the precise definitions into further terms with precise definitions within the framework. indecs and other frameworks based on it continue to be developed and refined through the process of implementation.

'''John Paris Bickell''', also known as '''Jack Bickell''', (September 26, 1884 – August 22, 1951) was a Canadian businessman, philanthropist, and sports team owner. He is best known for his long-time association with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] professional [[ice hockey]] team as the owner, president, chairman and director 1924-1951.

==Early life==

Bickell's parents were Rev. David Bickell and Annie Paris, who was a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Shea, MacLachlan, J.P. Bickell The Life, the Leafs and the Legacy&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Molesworth, Ontario|Molesworth]], near [[Listowel, Ontario|Listowel]], and raised in [[Toronto]], Bickell was their second child of four. His father died when he was six years old; his younger brother died when John was eight years old; and his older brother died in 1898 when John was 12 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Bickell Family Register&lt;/ref&gt;

Bickell attended St. Andrew's College, where he was one of the first 100 graduates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/standrewscollege/docs/the_andrean_-_fall_2012/27 The Andrean Fall 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brokerage interests==

Bickell started his own brokerage firm, J. P. Bickell &amp; Co., at the age of 23 and was a millionaire by 30. He sold his firm in 1919 to concentrate on his various movie and mining interests. His hiatus from the industry did not last long as on April 15, 1926 he was a senior partner in the New York brokerage firm of Thomson McKinnon.&lt;ref&gt;1926 April New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; He left the firm in to take on his WWII responsibilities in late 1939.

==Movie interests==

Bickell was a key player in the development of the movie industry in Canada. He served as president of both Eastern Theatres Limited and Hamilton United Theatres Limited. Eastern Theatres, oversaw the construction of Toronto’s Pantages Theatre, which specialized in the era’s wildly popular vaudeville acts.  Similarly, Bickell also served as vice-president of the Select Pictures Corporation a Canadian distribution company, and was also part of the team that acquired Montreal’s Théâtre St-Denis in October 1917. Bickell was vice-president of the Regent Theatre Company, one of Toronto’s first large movie theatres which stood on Adelaide between Yonge and Bay Streets.  The theatre’s company was formed in 1916 by a group of Toronto financiers including; P. W. Cushman, E. L. Ruddy, W. J. Sheppard, J. B. Tudhope and, of course, Bickell. Anticipating the ever-increasing interest in moving pictures, the company sought to acquire and transform J. Ambrose Small’s theatre, The Majestic, into a deluxe movie theatre.  In 1920 [[Famous Players|Famous Players Canadian Corporation Limited]] was founded in Bickell's office and he served as the Vice President with Nathan Nathanson as managing director. Bickell's friend W.D. Ross, head of the Bank of Nova Scotia and later Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario, Izaak Walton Killam of Royal Securities, Sir Herbert Samuel Holt of the Royal Bank, and Bickell, were all members of the Board of Directors that underwrote the necessary $4 million of the company’s initial share offerings. He ultimately sold out his interests in the movie industry in 1930 to the president of the corporation, Adolph Zukor of New York. Bickell then concentrated on his mining interests.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Shea, MacLachlan, J.P. Bickell The Live, the Leafs and the Legacy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seiler and Seiler, Reel Time&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mining interests==

Bickell's initial involvement in mining was in the early 1900s in Cobalt, Ontario.  In 1911 he invested in [[McIntyre Mines|McIntyre Porcupine Mines Ltd.]] in [[Schumacher, Ontario]]. He became the president and later chairman, a position he held until his death. His work in mining earned him a place in the [[Canadian Mining Hall of Fame]].

McIntyre Mine was formed in 1911, adding land staked by Sandy McIntyre to nearby ground obtained by Bickell. The initial assays were lean, but Bickell kept the faith and the company afloat through these tough times. Later, as grades improved, he obtained additional ground. The result was the McIntyre Porcupine Mine Limited, which has earned a place in Canadian mining history as one of the nation’s most important mines. Between 1912 and 1955, total production was valued at $230 million, and the company paid $62 million in dividends to shareholders. McIntyre also controlled the Belleterre gold mine in Quebec and the Castle-Trethewey silver mine near Gowganda, Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Mining Hall of Fame&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in sports==

===Boxing===
In 1919, Bickell’s sponsorship of boxing was with a belt that he put forth for Canada’s featherweight champion, known as the Bickell Belt.&lt;ref&gt;September 10, 1919 Toronto Daily Star&lt;/ref&gt;
*Boat racing - In 1920, Bickell was associated with the Toronto Syndicate, a group that built and sponsored racing boats in both Canada and the United States, including the hydroplanes Miss Toronto I and Miss Toronto II.  Not surprisingly, the Syndicate included some heavy hitters in the financial world, including; J.P.’s friend Alfred Rogers, the coal and cement baron, as well as: F. Ericson, Thomas Rea, S.A. Sylvester, Fred Miller, Cecil Allison, W.B. Cleland, and others. The Syndicate made several entries into various high-profile races on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border. At the Thousand Island Gold Cup in Alexandria Bay, New York, Miss Toronto II, with Bickell and Ericson at the helm, represented the Toronto Motor Boat Club: Miss Toronto II logged the fastest five miles ever recorded in competition up until that point. In doing a five-mile lap in five minutes flat, Miss Toronto II set a new North American record, and she was dubbed "the mile-a-minute boat".&lt;ref&gt;Variety Spice of Existence, Toronto Star&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miss Toronto II in Gold Cup Series, Toronto Daily Star (25 August 1920), 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hockey===
In 1924, Jack came into the hockey business when [[Charlie Querrie]] needed to financially reorganize his hockey team in Toronto called the [[Toronto St. Patricks]]. They had previously won a Stanley Cup in 1922. Bickell initially invested in the St. Pats in 1924 as a favor to his friend Charlie Querrie. When Querrie needed to sell the team in 1927, Bickell arranged for a group to buy the shares in the team and hired [[Conn Smythe]] to be the Managing Director, which kept the team in Toronto. Bickell owned the majority stake in the team, which was renamed the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]. With Smythe, Bickell helped in the organization and financing of the construction of the arena, named Maple Leaf Gardens, for the Leafs in 1931. "You could say, without exaggerating, that Bickell was the cornerstone of the whole project," said Smythe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?type=Builder&amp;mem=B197801&amp;list=ByName#photo&lt;/ref&gt; He was to be the first President of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. and also served as Chairman, until a board of directors meeting on November 19, 1947 when Bickell made arrangements for Conn Smythe to have controlling interest and become the President. Bickell then served as a Director until his death. His name is on the Stanley Cup six times: 1932, 1945, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1951. He was not included on the Cup with 1942 Toronto, as he was overseas serving in [[World War II]]. J.P. Bickell died in 1951 and work was underway to appropriately honor his contribution to the organization. In 1953, the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] board of directors established the [[J. P. Bickell Memorial Award]]. Bickell was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1978 in the Builders category.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Shea, MacLachlan J.P. Bickell The Life, the Leafs and the Legacy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hockey Hall of Fame&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golf===
In 1922, he built a mansion, adjacent to the [[Mississaugua Golf &amp; Country Club]], in the town of [[Port Credit|Port Credit, Ontario]] where he would live for the rest of his life. Bickell's involvement in the club was significant as he had sat on the board of directors, and he loaned the club $50,000 during the depression and was a life member. On the morning of August 15, 1925 J.P. made a 215 yard, hole-in-one on the third hole, the first person to ever "Ace" the hole.&lt;ref&gt;The first One Hundred Years, Mississaugua Golf and Country Club 2006, p23,30,31&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 1924 it was J.P. Bickell who gave [[Ada Mackenzie]] the final $8,000 two hours before her deadline to secure the land for the Ladies Golf Club of Toronto. "it was Mr. Bickell who saved our life". - Ada Mackenzie&lt;ref&gt;The Ladies, A History of the Ladies Golf Club of Toronto Tim O'Connor 1999,p34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baseball===
In 1931, Bickell also served as a director of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Toronto Maple Leafs]] baseball club, owning an interest and joining the board of directors when George Oakley took control of the team.

===General===
In 1939, Bickell bought the twenty-six-hundred-acre island in Georgian Bay Ontario. He formed Griffith Island Estates Inc., as the president with his friends; Bernard E. Smith, R.S. "Sam" McLaughlin, Thomas Seagram, Francis Farwell, J.L Sullivan, W. Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;Rose M. MacLeod, The Story of White Cloud, Hay and Griffith Islands (Richardson, Bond &amp; Wright, 1979)p139&lt;/ref&gt; The estate was for the purpose of a hunting and fishing retreat entertaining various dignitaries as the island boasted pheasants, deer, and wild game. They were also raising Hereford cattle on the island. As an avid fisherman Bickell also had shares in the Hillsburgh Fishing Club.

==Second World War==
During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Bickell was a key member of a group under Canadian [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook]], the British [[Minister of Aircraft Production]], which ensured an adequate supply of airplanes for the British forces known as the [[RAF Ferry Command]] and subsequently The Atlantic Ferry Organization (ATFERO). Bickell served two years with the British Airplane Supply Board. Along with other important businessmen and industrialists known as the 4 Busy B's with Beaverbrook, (former Prime Minister) R.B. Bennett and Beverly Baxter (M.P.). Bickell was recruited by his friend Lord Beaverbrook to become one of the famous "dollar-a-year" men who headed up wartime industry and special projects. In 1942, he returned to Canada to become the president and chairman of the board of [[Victory Aircraft]] Ltd. in [[Malton, Ontario]], the largest airplane manufacturer in Canada. Bickell was tasked with increasing the [[Avro Lancaster]] bomber production resulting in one per day rolling off the assembly line. This effort was credited with ultimately having a dramatic influence on winning the war.

It was no secret that Bickell was not a fan of the federal government of the day. Regardless, Bickell’s sense of duty to the nation prevailed and his commitment to the war effort on both sides of the Atlantic was unassailable. Bickell’s personal actions at the outbreak of the Second World War were very generous. On September 12, 1939 Bickell donated his Grumman Goose G21A CF BKE to the RCAF, which took it on strength with the military serial RCAF924. On November 1, 1940 J.P. donated his other plane, a Grumman Goose G-21A CF-BQE, which became RCAF 941 on November 1, 1940. The Grumman Goose G-21A aircraft were amphibious planes and during that time known as the rich man’s aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airhistory.org.uk/gy/reg_CF-3.html Civil Aircraft Register - Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942 Bickell wrote a cheque for five thousand dollars, which he donated to the RCAF’s Benevolent Fund. In a letter that accompanied the cheque, Bickell wrote {{quote|If there is any branch of the services which merits recognition in a deferential degree, surely it must be that in which the personnel suffer the highest percentage of casualties in relationship to their numbers, namely the air force. Furthermore, I am firmly convinced that had it not been for the indomitable courage, skill and sacrifices endured by them during the Battle of Britain, the destiny of democracy everywhere would long since have been shattered beyond recognition, if not completely eliminated. When one realizes that the age range in this group {{sic|comprises |hide=y|mainly of}} those just on the threshold of life and normally therefore with the longest expectancy before them, the tragedy to both them and their families becomes even more poignant.&lt;ref&gt;"Bickell Donates $5,000 to Air Force Benevolent Fund," Ottawa Journal (30 December 1942), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Aviation history==
After the war, Bickell co-founded A. V. Roe Canada Limited (AVRO), [[Avro Canada]] with Sir Roy Dobson. He paid the $1,200 incorporation fee out of his own pocket, and personally backed a $2.5 million dollar line of credit at the Canadian Bank of Commerce, of which he was a director. Dobson became the President and Bickell became the Chairman, a position he held until his death in August 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Avro Canadian Factory," Flight (29 November 1945), 573&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directorships==
In business, Bickell served as the Chairman of McIntyre-Porcupine Mines Limited and A. V. Roe Canada Limited and as a director of Canadian Bank of Commerce, International Nickel Company of Canada (INCO), Imperial Life Assurance, and National Trust. He was also an active in healthcare, serving on several boards, including that of Wellesley Hospital, St. John's Ambulance Association and he was the honorary president of the Health League of Canada.

==Philanthropy==
In the late 1930's the radio station and newsprint building burnt down in Timmins, it was owned by [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]] and it was J.P. Bickell who loaned him the necessary funds to re-build. In 1945, he provided the loan [[Jack Kent Cooke]] needed to buy Toronto radio station [[CHKT|CKEY]]. During his life Bickell gave generously and in death he willed $13 million of his $14.6 million estate to the creation of the J.P. Bickell Foundation managed by National Trust Company (now Scotiabank). He established it to donate half of its interest income each year at; 50% to the [[Hospital for Sick Children]], 10% for bursaries aiding in Medical Research, 5% to Mining scholarships and 35% to be distributed to general charities in Ontario at the discretion of the J.P. Bickell Foundation Management Committee. The Foundation has contributed $160 million to charity from 1953-2017.&lt;ref&gt;Scotia Wealth Management&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his death he bequeathed a multi-million dollar collection of approximately 112 pieces of original artwork and artifacts to the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] (AGO),of which he was a founder-member. Camp Bickell is a non-profit children's camp that was established on Chapman Lake initially in 1939 with the assistance of Mr. Bickell and in 1949, he provided the necessary funds of $5,000 to permanently secure the land. The camp near Iroquois Falls is still in operation today (2017) and receives approximately 600 campers per season.

==Death==
J.P. Bickell died in [[New York City]] on August 22, 1951 at age 66 and was buried in the Mausoleum at [[Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto|Mount Pleasant Cemetery]] in Toronto. Bickell’s life work and philanthropy isn’t well known because he was a private man who did not seek self promotion. His self-built business empire allowed him to be extremely charitable, a legacy that has continued after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.mississauga.com/opinion-story/7558083-j-p-bickell-our-most-unknown-great-canadian-/|title = J.P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2003">'''Jan Justus Enschedé''' (1807 in [[Haarlem]] &amp;ndash; 1887 in Haarlem)&lt;ref name="NNBW"&gt;P.C. Molhuysen en P.J. Blok (red.), [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/molh003nieu04_01/molh003nieu04_01_0893.php Nieuw Nederlandsch biografisch woordenboek. Deel 1] (Dutch) Jan Justus Enschedé (3)&lt;/ref&gt; was a newspaper editor and printer in Haarlem, the Netherlands.

==Biography==
He was the great great grandson of the founder of the [[Joh. Enschedé]] company, and the son of [[Jacobus Enschedé II]]. Like his second cousin and mentor [[Johannes Enschedé III]], he was a member of the [[Dutch Society of Science]] and the [[Teylers Second Society]]. He worked for Enschedé III as editor of the [[Opregte Haarlemsche Courant]] from 1829, later joined by [[Johannes Enschedé IV]]. In 1850 they had a quarrel with the city council of Haarlem over the use of the [[Coat of arms of Haarlem|city coat of arms]] in the newspaper. As city publisher they had the right, but Haarlem withdrew this privilege, claiming ownership. Jan Justus wrote a book explaining the case of Enschedé, which they won.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ifFQAAAAcAAJ Bedenkingen tegen de adviezen van mr. B. Donker Curtius en mr. G. de Vries  Az., omtrent het eigendomsregt der Opregte Haarlemsche Courant] by Jan Justus Enschedé on [[Google books]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s the paper was considered the best in the country and attracted editors such as [[Conrad Busken Huet]] and [[Multatuli]].

'''Jennifer A. Chatman''' is the Paul J. Cortese Distinguished Professor of [[Management science|Management]] at the [[Haas School of Business]], [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Chatman received her BA and PhD from UC Berkeley and began her career at the [[Kellogg School of Management]] at [[Northwestern University]] in Chicago, Illinois, before returning to UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. She served as the Marvin Bower Fellow at the [[Harvard Business School]].

== Research ==

Professor Chatman's research focuses on 1) how a culture emphasizing innovation and adaptation buffers firms from economic volatility, 2) how CEO’s personality influences organizational culture, and 3) how diverse groups perform in high pressure situations. Professor Chatman has developed the Organizational Culture Profile (OCP) for assessing organizational culture strength and content as well as the gaps between an organization’s current and desired culture.

Professor Chatman’s research has been highlighted in ''the Atlantic'', ''Business Week'', ''Business 2.0'', the ''Financial Times'', ''Fortune'', ''Inc.'', ''Glamour'', ''The Jungle'', the ''New York Times'', the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', the ''Los Angeles Times'', the ''Wall Street Journal'', and ''Working Mother''. She was a keynote speaker for the Private Equity Women’s Conference, the AACSB Dean’s Conference, and the Economist Innovation Summit. She interviewed Jack Welch for the Commonwealth Club, Comcast, and NPR, and has appeared on television and radio over the years to talk about her research and consulting work. She has written articles that have appeared in numerous academic journals.

=== Culture, adaptability, and firm performance ===

Chatman's research explores how [[organizational culture]] relates to organizational performance and also focuses on providing a conceptually rigorous and valid approach to assessing culture.

=== Norms and group composition ===

Classic research in psychology, dating back to Sherif’s pioneering work on the so-called "Robber's Cave" experiments showed that social norms, particularly those that orient group members toward group goals, are remarkably strong predictors of behavior. Professor Chatman’s work has been part of a more recent effort to link norms to processes and outcomes among diverse work groups.

Relevant papers:

* Goncalo, J., Chatman, J., Duguid, M., &amp; Kennedy, J. (2015) Creativity from constraint: How the PC norm influences creativity in mixed-sex work groups. ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 60: 1-30.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/chatman/papers/ASQ-2015-Goncalo-1-30.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leadership reconceptualized as influence and status ===

Professor Chatman’s research on leadership focuses on reconceptualizing traditional theories of leadership which have, by many accounts, reached a point of stagnation. By stripping  down the psychological basis of leadership in influence she is able to make more progress in understanding how leaders affect followers in organizations.

Teece and M. Augier. ''Palgrave Encyclopedia of Strategic Management''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palgraveconnect.com/esm/doifinder/10.1057/9781137294678.0362&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7774">'''José Carlos Brunoro''' ([[Santo André]], 11 June 1950), commonly known as '''Brunoro''', was the CEO of [[Palmeiras]], one of Brazil's largest soccer teams, and the co-founder of [[Grêmio Osasco Audax Esporte Clube]]. He has over 40 years of experience in professional sports in a plethora of positions: professional athlete, trainer, coach, sports executive, sports marketing consultant, appointed member of  the national council for sports (CNE) by Brazil’s ministry of sports, among others. Brunoro held executive positions in different professional sports such as [[volleyball]], [[soccer]], [[Formula One]], and [[basketball]]. 

==Palmeiras== 
Between 1992 and 1996, Brunoro was a soccer executive at [[Palmeiras]] and signed young players like [[Rivaldo]], [[Roberto Carlos]], who are now recognized as some of the best of all times. On June 12 1993, Palmeiras won the São Paulo championship, beating the rival Corinthians 4x0 in the final. The last major title that the club had won was in 1976, 17 years prior to that one.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.lance.com.br/palmeiras/torcedores-verdao-contam-suas-historias-sobre-junho-1993.html Torcedores do Verdão contam suas histórias sobre 12 de junho de 1993, Lance! 14 de junho de 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Brunoro became the CEO of [[Palmeiras]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://esportes.estadao.com.br/noticias/futebol,por-profissionalizacao-brunoro-sera-ceo-no-palmeiras,987843 Por Profissionalização, Brunoro será CEO no Palmeiras - Estadão.com 23/01/2013]&lt;/ref&gt;Brazil’s fourth largest team with over 10 million fans.

In the beginning of his mandate as CEO, in January 2013, Brunoro ended speculations about bringing Argentine superstar [[Juan Román Riquelme]] to play for [[Palmeiras]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/palmeiras/noticia/2013/01/palmeiras-desiste-de-riquelme-nao-podemos-nos-dar-ao-luxo-diz-nobre.html Palmeiras desiste de Riquelme.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13490">"'''Late capitalism'''" is a term used to refer to [[capitalism]] from about 1945 onwards, with the implication that it is due to come to an end. This period includes the era termed the [[golden age of capitalism]].

The American literary critic and cultural theorist [[Frederic Jameson]] considered [[Rudolf Hilferding]]'s term ''latest capitalism'' (''jüngster Kapitalismus'') a more prudent and less prophetic-seeming one than ''late capitalism'',&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; although he repeatedly deployed the latter term in his writings. French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] favoured ''[[neo-capitalism]]'' over ''post-'' or ''late-capitalism''.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Malabou/Jacques Derrida, ''Counterpath'' (2004) p. 114-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the term==
The term "late capitalism" was first used by [[Werner Sombart]] in his 1902 magnum opus ''Der Moderne Kapitalismus''; Sombart divided capitalism into three stages: early capitalism; high capitalism, the heyday of capitalism; and late capitalism. The term began to be used by socialists in Europe towards the end of the 1930s and in the 1940s, when many economists believed capitalism was doomed.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Natalie Moszkowska]]'s [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL6479733M/Zur_Dynamik_des_Spa%CC%88tkapitalismus''Zur Dynamik des Spätkapitalismus'']. Zurich: Verlag Der Aufbruch, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of [[World War II]], many economists, including [[Joseph Schumpeter]] and [[Paul Samuelson]], believed the end of capitalism could well be nigh, in that the economic problems might be insurmountable.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Armstrong, Andrew Glyn and John Harrison, ''Capitalism Since World War II: The Making and Breakup of the Great Boom.'' Fontana, 1984, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used in the 1960s, particularly in Germany and Austria, among others by Western Marxists writing in the tradition of the [[Frankfurt School]] and [[Austromarxism]]. Postwar German sociologists needed a term to describe contemporary society. [[Theodor Adorno]] preferred "late capitalism" over "industrial society," which was the theme of the 16th Congress of German Sociologists in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor W. Adorno (ed.) ''Spätkapitalismus oder Industriegesellschaft. Verhandlungen des 16. Deutschen Soziologentages.'' Stuttgart, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, [[Leo Kofler]] published a book called ''Technologische Rationalität im Spätkapitalismus'' (Technological Rationality in Late Capitalism). [[Claus Offe]] published his essay "Spätkapitalismus - Versuch einer Begriffsbestimmung" (Late capitalism - attempt at a conceptual definition) in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claus Offe]], ''Strukturprobleme ds kapitalistischen Staates''. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1972, pp. 7-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  And in 1973, [[Jürgen Habermas]] published his ''Legitimationsprobleme im Spätkapitalismus'' (Legitimacy problems in late capitalism).&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''Legitimationsprobleme im Spätkapitalismus'' Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Marcuse]] also accepted the term.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, "Protosocialism and Late Capitalism: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis Based on Bahro's Analysis". ''International Journal of Politics'', Vol. 10 No. 2/3, Summer-Fall 1980,  25-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
'[[Private property]]' is a fundamental concept within the economic system of [[capitalism]] and  [[neoclassical economics]].
[[Vladimir Lenin]] famously declared that there are no "absolutely hopeless situations" for capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Lenin, "Report On The International Situation And The Fundamental Tasks Of The Communist International", July 19, 1920 [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x03.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, does not deter critics{{who|date=January 2017}} of the system, who point to its relative newness, the rapid collapse of prior orders of much greater duration, the effects of modern communications on [[class consciousness]], and a general perceived inadequacy of its ability to deal with various crises of its own making and other long term structural problems.

[[Immanuel Wallerstein]] believes that capitalism may be in the process of being replaced by another [[world-systems theory|world system]].&lt;ref&gt;Michele Dillon, ''Introduction to Sociological Theory'' (2009) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Others{{who|date=January 2017}} however see late capitalism in the 21st century as very much in active development; and characterised by a new mix of high-tech advances, the concentration of (speculative) financial capital, and [[Post-Fordism]]—all producing a backdrop of increasing differentiation in wealth/security between the better off and the worse off and in between.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Targ, ''Late Capitalism, Neoliberal Globalization, &amp; Militarism'' (2006) p. 15-26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandel==

According to the [[Marxist]] economist [[Ernest Mandel]], who popularised the term with his 1972 PhD dissertation, late-stage capitalism will be dominated by the machinations—or perhaps better, fluidities—of [[financial capital]];&lt;ref&gt;''The Jameson Reader'' p. 268-9&lt;/ref&gt; and also by the increasing [[commodification]] and [[industrialisation]] of ever more inclusive sectors of human life. Mandel was insistent that "Far from representing a 'post-industrial society', late capitalism thus constitutes ''generalized universal industrialization'' for the first time in history".&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, ''Late Capitalism'' (London: Humanities Press, 1975) p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; Up to the mid-1960s, Mandel preferred to use the term "neo-capitalism", which was most often used by intellectuals in Belgium and France around that time, such as Leo Michielsen and [[Andre Gorz]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, ''The economics of neocapitalism.''

In his major work ''Late Capitalism'', Mandel argues for three periods in the development of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]. The first is ''freely competitive capitalism'', which occurred from 1700 to 1850 and is characterized largely by the growth of industrial capital in domestic markets.  Secondly there  is the phase of ''monopoly capitalism'', which lasted until approximately 1940, and is characterized by the [[imperialism|imperialistic]] development of international markets as well as the exploitation of [[colony|colonial territories]].  Finally there is the epoch of ''late capitalism'' emerging out of the [[Second World War]], which has as its dominant features the [[multinational corporation]], [[globalization|globalized markets and labor]], [[consumerism|mass consumption]], and the space of liquid multinational [[capital flows|flows of capital]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Jameson Reader'' p. 165-6&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tradition of the [[orthodox Marxism|classical Marxists]], Mandel tried to characterize the nature of the modern epoch as a whole, with reference to the main laws of motion of capitalism specified by Marx.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jameson Reader'', p. 216-7&lt;/ref&gt; Mandel's aim was to explain the unexpected revival of capitalism after World War II, contrary to leftist prognostications, and the long economic boom which showed the fastest economic growth ever seen in human history.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jameson Reader'', p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; His work has produced a new interest in the theory of [[long waves]] in economic development.&lt;ref&gt;Grace K. Hong, ''The Ruptures of American Capital'' (2006) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jameson==

Jameson uses Mandel's third stage designation as the point of departure for his widely cited ''Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Jameson argues that this [[postmodernity]] involves an emergence of a ''cultural dominant'', or mode of cultural production, which differs markedly in its various manifestations (developments in literature, film, fine art, video, social theory, etc.) from those of its predecessor, referred to collectively and broadly as Modernism, particularly in its treatment of "subject position", temporality and narrative. For Jameson, "every position on postmodernism today—whether apologia or stigmatization—is also...''necessarily'' an implicitly or explicitly political stance on the nature of multinational capitalism today".&lt;ref&gt;''The Jameson Reader'', p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; A section of Jameson's [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/jameson.htm  analysis] has been reproduced on the Marxists Internet Archive.

Jameson (1996) saw the current, "third" moment of capitalist evolution as involving a new and previously unparalleled global reach—whether it was conceptualised as multinational or as informational capitalism; but expressed doubts as to whether it yet represented what Marx had originally foreseen as the final stage of capitalism, with the universal commodification of the world market.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jameson Reader'' p. 164-171&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==

* The theme of "[[the end of history]]" was developed by the German philosopher [[Hegel]], and was rekindled in the 20th Century by [[Kojève]] in his ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel''. The "[[The End of History|end of history]]" is discussed by [[Francis Fukuyama]] in his 1992 book of the same name which argues that history has "ended" (in the Hegelian sense) because there is no serious or viable competition to [[liberal democracy]] as a form of government and/or to capitalism as an economic system. Thus, the very concept of "late capitalism"  is invalidated as there is no evidence of transformation from, or to, any alternative governmental or economic system.
* A related term is ''late [[bourgeois society]]'' as contrasted with ''early bourgeois society'' in the 17th and 18th century, and ''classical bourgeois society'' in the 19th and early 20th century.
* Marxist–Leninists prefer the concept of [[state monopoly capitalism]].

==In popular culture==
*A character in [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel ''[[Bleeding Edge]]'' states: "late capitalism is a [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid racket]] on a global scale...getting the suckers to believe it's all gonna go on forever."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Pynchon]], ''[[Bleeding Edge]]'' (2013) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

*According to a 2017 article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', the term "late capitalism" is again in vogue to describe the modern economy.&lt;ref&gt;Annie Lowrey, "Why the Phrase 'Late Capitalism' Is Suddenly Everywhere". ''The Atlantic'', 1 May 2017.[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/05/late-capitalism/524943/]&lt;/ref&gt; The term had entered mainstream discourse in the United States, albeit with a semantic change or ironic twist. "Late capitalism", as it became commonly used, has become a catch-all term for various incidents that express capitalism's distortions, and it is often used in critique and satire. In this usage, there is also a sense that contemporary capitalism cannot go on like it does forever.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

[[File:loomwork.jpg|thumb|A woman in [[Konya]], [[Turkey]], works at a [[#Haute lisse and basse lisse looms|vertical]] loom]]
A '''loom''' is a device used to [[weaving|weave]] cloth and tapestry. The basic purpose of any loom is to hold the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] threads under [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] to facilitate the interweaving of the [[weft]] threads. The precise shape of the loom and its mechanics may vary, but the basic function is the same.

==Etymology==
The word "loom" is derived from the [[Old English]] ''geloma'', formed from ge-(perfective prefix) and ''loma'', a root of unknown origin; this meant a utensil, tool, or machine of any kind.  In 1404 it was used to mean a machine to enable weaving thread into cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=loom|title=loom - Origin and meaning of loom by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1838, it had gained the meaning of a machine for interlacing thread.

==Weaving==
{{see also|Weaving|Textile manufacturing terminology}}
[[File:Weaving demonstrated on a historic loom in Leiden.webm|thumbtime=12|thumb|right|Weaving demonstration on an 1830 handloom in the [[Museum Het Leids Wevershuis|weaving museum]] in [[Leiden]] ]]
Weaving is done by intersecting the longitudinal threads, the '''[[Warp (weaving)|warp]]''', i.e. "that which is thrown across",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=warp|title=warp - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the transverse threads, the '''[[weft]]''', i.e. "that which is woven".

The major components of the loom are the warp beam, [[heddle]]s, harnesses or shafts (as few as two, four is common, sixteen not unheard of), [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]], [[reed (weaving)|reed]] and takeup roll. In the loom, yarn processing includes shedding, picking, battening and taking-up operations. These are the principal motions.

*'''Shedding'''. Shedding is the raising of part of the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] yarn to form a [[shed (weaving)|shed]] (the vertical space between the raised and unraised warp yarns), through which the filling yarn, carried by the shuttle, can be inserted, forming the weft. On the modern loom, simple and intricate shedding operations are performed automatically by the heddle or heald frame, also known as a harness. This is a rectangular frame to which a series of wires, called heddles or healds, are attached. The yarns are passed through the eye holes of the heddles, which hang vertically from the harnesses. The weave pattern determines which harness controls which warp yarns, and the number of harnesses used depends on the complexity of the weave. Two common methods of controlling the heddles are [[Dobby loom|dobbies]] and a [[Jacquard Loom|Jacquard Head]].
[[File:Weaving shuttles.JPG|thumb|Shuttles]]
*'''Picking'''. As the harnesses raise the [[heddle]]s or healds, which raise the warp yarns, the shed is created. The filling yarn is inserted through the shed by a small carrier device called a shuttle. The shuttle is normally pointed at each end to allow passage through the shed. In a traditional shuttle loom, the filling yarn is wound onto a quill, which in turn is mounted in the shuttle. The filling yarn emerges through a hole in the shuttle as it moves across the loom. A single crossing of the shuttle from one side of the loom to the other is known as a pick. As the shuttle moves back and forth across the shed, it weaves an edge, or [[selvage]], on each side of the fabric to prevent the fabric from raveling.
*'''Battening'''. Between the heddles and the takeup roll, the warp threads pass through another frame called the reed (which resembles a comb). The portion of the fabric that has already been formed but not yet rolled up on the takeup roll is called the fell. After the shuttle moves across the loom laying down the fill yarn, the weaver uses the reed to press (or batten) each filling yarn against the fell. Conventional shuttle looms can operate at speeds of about 150 to 160 picks per minute.&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 104"&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|1970|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two secondary motions, because with each weaving operation the newly constructed fabric must be wound on a cloth beam. This process is called taking up. At the same time, the warp yarns must be let off or released from the warp beams. To become fully automatic, a loom needs a tertiary motion, the filling stop motion. This will brake the loom if the weft thread breaks.&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 104"/&gt; An automatic loom requires 0.125&amp;nbsp;hp to 0.5&amp;nbsp;hp to operate.

==Types of looms==

===Back strap loom===
[[File:SantaMariadelRio145.webm|thumb|Woman weaving a silk [[rebozo]] on a backstrap loom at the Taller Escuela de Rebocería in Santa Maria del Rio, San Luis Potosí]]
A simple loom which has roots in ancient civilizations consists of two sticks or bars between which the warps are stretched. One bar is attached to a fixed object, and the other to the weaver usually by means of a strap around the back. On traditional looms, the two main sheds are operated by means of a shed roll over which one set of warps pass, and continuous string heddles which encase each of the warps in the other set. The weaver leans back and uses their body weight to tension the loom. To open the shed controlled by the string heddles, the weaver relaxes tension on the warps and raises the heddles. The other shed is usually opened by simply drawing the shed roll toward the weaver. Both simple and complex textiles can be woven on this loom. Width is limited to how far the weaver can reach from side to side to pass the shuttle. Warp faced textiles, often decorated with intricate pick-up patterns woven in complementary and supplementary warp techniques are woven by indigenous peoples today around the world. They produce such things as belts, ponchos, bags, hatbands and carrying cloths. Supplementary weft patterning and brocading is practiced in many regions. Balanced weaves are also possible on the backstrap loom. Today, commercially produced backstrap loom kits often include a rigid heddle.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Warp-weighted loom===
{{main|Warp-weighted loom}}
The [[warp-weighted loom]] is a vertical loom that may have originated in the [[Neolithic]] period. The earliest evidence of warp-weighted looms comes from sites belonging to the [[Starčevo culture]] in modern Serbia and Hungary and from late Neolithic sites in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barber|1991|pp.93–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; This loom was used in [[Ancient Greece]], and spread north and west throughout Europe thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowfoot| 1936| p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its defining characteristic is hanging weights (loom weights) which keep bundles of the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] threads taut. Frequently, extra warp thread is wound around the weights. When a weaver has reached the bottom of the available warp, the completed section can be rolled around the top beam, and additional lengths of warp threads can be unwound from the weights to continue. This frees the weaver from vertical size constraint.

===Drawloom===
A drawloom is a hand-loom for weaving figured cloth. In a drawloom, a "figure harness" is used to control each warp thread separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|1980|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; A drawloom requires two operators, the weaver and an assistant called a "drawboy" to manage the figure harness. The earliest confirmed drawloom fabrics come from the [[Chu (state)|State of Chu]] and date c. 400 BC.&lt;ref name="broudy 1979 124"&gt;Broudy (1979), 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars attribute the invention of the drawloom to the ancient Chinese, although some speculate an independent invention from ancient [[Syria]] since drawloom fabrics found in [[Dura-Europas]] are thought to date before 256 AD.&lt;ref name="broudy 1979 124"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forbes (1987), 218 &amp; 220.&lt;/ref&gt; The draw loom for patterned weaving was invented in ancient China during the Han Dynasty.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Explorations in the History of Machines and Mechanisms: Proceedings of HMM2012 (History of Mechanism and Machine Science) |last= Ceccarelli |first= Marco |last2=López-Cajún |first2=Carlos  |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |pages=219–220 |isbn=978-9400799448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese weavers and artisans used foot-powered multi-harness looms and jacquard looms for silk weaving and embroidery; both of which were cottage industries with imperial workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=A History of Mechanical Inventions |last= Payson Usher  |first= 	Abbott  |year=2011 |publisher= Dover Publications |page=54 |isbn=978-0486255934}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese-invented drawloom enhanced and sped up the production of silk and play a significant role in Chinese silk weaving. The loom was later introduced to Persia, India, and Europe.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:Traditional loom at Ranipauwa-Muktinath, Nepal-WLV-1197.jpg|thumb|Traditional loom at Ranipauwa Muktinath, Nepal]]
A handloom is a simple machine used for weaving. In a wooden vertical-shaft looms, the [[heddle]]s are fixed in place in the shaft. The warp threads pass alternately through a heddle, and through a space between the heddles (the [[shed (weaving)|shed]]), so that raising the shaft raises half the threads (those passing through the heddles), and lowering the shaft lowers the same threads — the threads passing through the spaces between the heddles remain in place. This was a great invention in the 13th century.

===Flying shuttle===
{{main|Flying shuttle}}
Hand weavers could only weave a cloth as wide as their armspan. If cloth needed to be wider, two people would do the task (often this would be an adult with a child). [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] (1704–1779) patented the [[flying shuttle]] in 1733. The weaver held a picking stick that was attached by cords to a device at both ends of the shed. With a flick of the wrist, one cord was pulled and the shuttle was propelled through the shed to the other end with considerable force, speed and efficiency. A flick in the opposite direction and the shuttle was propelled back. A single weaver had control of this motion but the flying shuttle could weave much wider fabric than an arm’s length at much greater speeds than had been achieved with the hand thrown shuttle.

The ''flying shuttle'' was one of the key developments in [[weaving]] that helped fuel the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The whole picking motion no longer relied on manual skill and it was just a matter of time before it could be powered.

===''Haute-lisse'' and ''basse-lisse'' looms===
Looms used for weaving traditional [[tapestry]] are classified as ''[[Warp (weaving)|haute-lisse]]'' looms, where the warp is suspended vertically between two rolls. In ''basse-lisse'' looms, however, the warp extends horizontally between the two rolls.

===Ribbon weaving===
{{main|Inkle weaving}}

===Traditional looms===
Several other types of hand looms exist, including the [[simple frame loom]], [[pit loom]], [[free-standing loom]], and the [[pegged loom]]. Each of these can be constructed, and provide work and income in developing economies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cd3wd.com/cd3wd_40/vita/handloom/en/handloom.htm Handlooms: Practical guide to constructing viable handlooms, Joan Koster,1978] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302081647/http://www.cd3wd.com/cd3wd_40/vita/handloom/en/handloom.htm |date=2014-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power looms==
{{Main|Power loom}}
[[File:QSMM Two Lancashire looms.ogg|thumb|Two Lancashire looms in the [[Queen Street Mill]] weaving shed, [[Burnley]]]]
[[File:Weben in der Tuchfabrik Müller.ogv|thumb|A 1939 loom working at the [[Mueller Cloth Mill]] museum in [[Euskirchen]], Germany.]]

[[Edmund Cartwright]] built and patented a [[power loom]] in 1785, and it was this that was adopted by the nascent cotton industry in England. The silk loom made by [[Jacques Vaucanson]] in 1745 operated on the same principles but was not developed further. The invention of the [[flying shuttle]] by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] was critical to the development of a commercially successful power loom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marsden|1895|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright's loom was impractical but the ideas behind it were developed by numerous inventors in the Manchester area of England where, by 1818, there were 32 factories containing 5,732 looms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guest|1823|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horrocks loom]] was viable, but it was the [[Roberts Loom]] in 1830 that marked the turning point.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marsden|1895|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incremental changes to the three motions continued to be made. The problems of sizing, stop-motions, consistent take-up, and a [[temple]] to maintain the width remained. In 1841, Kenworthy and [[Howard &amp; Bullough|Bullough]] produced the [[Lancashire Loom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marsden|1895|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was self-acting or semi-automatic. This enables a youngster to run six looms at the same time. Thus, for simple calicos, the power loom became more economical to run than the hand loom – with complex patterning that used a dobby or Jacquard head, jobs were still [[domestic system|put out]] to handloom weavers until the 1870s. Incremental changes were made such as the [[Dickinson Loom]], culminating in the [[Keighley]]-born inventor Northrop, who was working for the [[Draper Corporation]] in [[Hopedale, Massachusetts|Hopedale]] producing the fully automatic [[Northrop Loom]]. This loom recharged the shuttle when the [[pirn]] was empty. The Draper E and X models became the leading products from 1909. They were challenged by synthetic fibres such as [[rayon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mass|1990|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1942, faster, more efficient, and shuttleless [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]] and [[rapier loom]]s had been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|1970|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern industrial looms can weave at 2,000 [[weft|weft insertion]]s per minute.&lt;ref name=Rajagopalan&gt;S. Rajagopalan, S.S.M. College of Engineering, Komarapalayam, [http://www.pdexcil.org/news/40N1002/advances.htm Pdexcil.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129031824/http://www.pdexcil.org/news/40N1002/advances.htm |date=2010-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weft insertion===
[[File:Greifer.JPG|thumb|A [[Picanol]] rapier loom]]
Different types of looms are most often defined by the way that the weft, or pick, is inserted into the warp. Many advances in weft insertion have been made in order to make manufactured cloth more cost effective. There are five main types of weft insertion and they are as follows:
* Shuttle: The first-ever powered looms were shuttle-type looms. Spools of weft are unravelled as the shuttle travels across the shed. This is very similar to projectile methods of weaving, except that the weft spool is stored on the shuttle. These looms are considered obsolete in modern industrial fabric manufacturing because they can only reach a maximum of 300 picks per minute.
* Air jet: An [[Air jet loom|air-jet loom]] uses short quick bursts of compressed air to propel the weft through the shed in order to complete the weave. Air jets are the fastest traditional method of weaving in modern manufacturing and they are able to achieve up to 1,500 picks per minute. However, the amounts of compressed air required to run these looms, as well as the complexity in the way the air jets are positioned, make them more costly than other looms. 
* Water jet: Water-jet looms use the same principle as air-jet looms, but they take advantage of pressurized water to propel the weft. The advantage of this type of weaving is that water power is cheaper where water is directly available on site. Picks per minute can reach as high as 1,000. 
* [[Rapier loom]]: This type of weaving is very versatile, in that rapier looms can weave using a large variety of threads.  There are several types of rapiers, but they all use a hook system attached to a rod or metal band to pass the pick across the shed. These machines regularly reach 700 picks per minute in normal production.
* Projectile: [[Projectile loom]]s utilize an object that is propelled across the shed, usually by spring power, and is guided across the width of the cloth by a series of reeds. The projectile is then removed from the weft fibre and it is returned to the opposite side of the machine so it can get reused. Multiple projectiles are in use in order to increase the pick speed. Maximum speeds on these machines can be as high as 1,050 ppm.

===Shedding===

====Dobby looms====
A [[dobby loom]] is a type of floor loom that controls the whole warp threads using a dobby head. Dobby is a corruption of "draw boy" which refers to the weaver's helpers who used to control the warp thread by pulling on draw threads. A dobby loom is an alternative to a treadle loom, where multiple heddles (shafts) were controlled by foot treadles – one for each heddle.

====Jacquard looms====
The '''Jacquard loom''' is a mechanical loom, invented by [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] in 1801, which simplifies the process of manufacturing [[textiles]] with complex patterns such as [[Brocade (fabric)|brocade]], [[damask]] and [[matelasse]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, "The Age of Revolution", (London 1962; repr. 2008), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christinalynn.com/fabric-glossary.shtml |title=Fabric Glossary |accessdate=2008-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105170019/http://www.christinalynn.com/fabric-glossary.shtml |archivedate=2009-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loom is controlled by [[punched card]]s with punched holes, each row of which corresponds to one row of the design. Multiple rows of holes are punched on each card and the many cards that compose the design of the textile are strung together in order. It is based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen [[Basile Bouchon]] (1725), Jean Baptiste Falcon (1728) and [[Jacques Vaucanson]] (1740)&lt;ref&gt;[[#RAZY|C. Razy]] p.120 (1913)&lt;/ref&gt; To call it a loom is a misnomer, a Jacquard head could be attached to a power loom or a hand loom, the head controlling which warp thread was raised during shedding. Multiple shuttles could be used to control the colour of the weft during picking.  The Jacquard loom is the predecessor to the [[punch card computer]]s of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=GESELOWITZ|first1=MICHAEL N|title=The Jacquard Loom: A Driver of the Industrial Revolution|url=http://theinstitute.ieee.org/tech-history/technology-history/the-jacquard-loom-a-driver-of-the-industrial-revolution|publisher=The Institute: The IEEE news source|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circular looms==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Six shuttle circular loom machine.jpg|thumb|typical circular loom]] --&gt;
A circular loom is used to create a seamless tube of fabric for products such as hosiery, sacks, clothing, fabric hose (such as fire hose) and the like. Circular looms can be small jigs used for [[Circular knitting]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIA53WfVv04  You tube demonstration] access-date= 2016-06-27&lt;/ref&gt; or large high-speed machines for modern garments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starlinger.com/en/packaging/circular-looms/ High throughput Austrian manufacturer] access-date= 2016-06-27&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern circular looms use up to ten shuttles driven from below in a circular motion by electromagnets for the weft yarns, and cams to control the warp threads. The warps rise and fall with each shuttle passage, unlike the common practice of lifting all of them at once.

== Symbolism and cultural significance ==

The Loom is a symbol of cosmic creation and the structure upon which individual destiny is woven. This symbolism is encapsulated in the ancient Greek myth of Arachne who was changed into a spider by the goddess Athene, who was jealous of her skill at the godlike craft of weaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tresidder|first1=Jack|title=The Hutchinson Dictionary of Symbols|date=1997|publisher=Helicon Publishers|location=London|isbn=1-85986-059-1|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Maya Cultures the goddess Ixchel who is symbolized by the moon, taught the first woman how to weave at the beginning of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenbaum|first1=Brenda P.|title=Mayan Women, Weaving and Ethnic Identity: a Historical Essay|journal=Guatemala: Museo Ixchel del Traje Indigena|date=1990|pages=157–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the founder of the Steve JobsSchool,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stevejobsschool.world/contact/|title=Contact - Steve JobsSchool|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; an elementary school which gives each student an iPad to encourage [[individualized learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-schools-revolutionize-education-ipad-2013-8|title=Dutch 'Steve Jobs Schools' Are Trying To Revolutionize Education Through iPad Learning|last=Jacobs|first=Peter|date=2013-08-22|website=Business Insider|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, 35 public schools in the Netherlands adopted the school model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edtechdigest.wordpress.com/2016/05/09/finding-the-right-model/|title=Finding the Right Model|last=de Hond|first=Maurice|date=2016-05-09|website=EdTech Digest|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Steve JobsSchools opened in South Africa in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodthingsguy.com/business/steve-jobs-schools/|title=Steve Jobs Schools launch in South Africa|last=Lindeque|first=Brent|date=2016-06-30|website=The Good Things Guy|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
De Hond studied human geography at the University of Amsterdam, obtaining a degree in 1971. He worked for the university, as assistant with the Sociaal Geografisch Instituut, but became a project leader for Interview-NSS in 1973. He founded Cebeon with [[Hedy d'Ancona]] in 1975, a market research firm targeting the non-profit sector, which he left in 1980 to become a director at Interview-NSS, later a commissioner until 1999. Starting in the mid-80s, De Hond started doing consultancy work for various companies, including [[Vendex]] (for which he led the computer department [[Microcomputer Club Nederland]] (MCN) of the [[Vroom &amp; Dreesmann]] department store and the [[Dixons (Netherlands)|Dixons]] electricals store in the 1980s), ITT and Wegener. In 1998, he was one of the founders of [[Newconomy]], an internet start-up, which after a stock exchange listing in 2000, saw a market cap of €400 million, but sequently lost much of its market value. Eventually, De Hond had to resign from his leadership position. He now polls through his own company, and internet site Peil.nl.

==Deventer murder case==
{{Main|Deventer murder case}}
Since 2005, De Hond campaigned to reopen a murder case that happened in the Dutch city of [[Deventer]]. De Hond believed that a [[tax advisor]] named Ernest Louwes was wrongfully convicted, and that a handyman of the murdered woman, Michaël de Jong, was behind the murder. De Hond led his own investigation into the matter, but a subsequent investigation by the public prosecutors found no reason to reopen the case. De Jong brought De Hond to court over his allegations, which De Hond refused to subside after the matter was closed. A Dutch court found De Hond at fault in continuation of his allegations, after which De Hond was reprimanded and forced to pay De Jong and his girlfriend over €100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Maurice de Hond moet schadevergoeding betalen aan de klusjesman en diens vriendin | url = http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Actualiteiten/Maurice+de+Hond+moet+schadevergoeding+betalen+aan+de+klusjesman+en+diens+vriendin.htm | publisher = Rechtspraak.nl | date = 2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Police Search Maurice de Hond | url = http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=1&amp;story_id=36530 | publisher = Expatica | date = 2007-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Pollster offers to apologise over murder claim | url = http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=19&amp;story_id=30777 | publisher = Expatica | date = 2006-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing conditions==
Mikasa manufactures products in [[Thailand]] and has been accused of [[workplace bullying|workplace brutality]] and [[human rights]] violations in some factories. The [[International Trade Union Confederation]], published a report alleging "systematic anti-union campaigns" by Mikasa.&lt;ref name="ituc"&gt;2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Thailand: Violations in 2006, International Trade Union Confederation, 2007, [http://survey07.ituc-csi.org/getcountry.php?IDCountry=THA&amp;IDLang=EN survey07.ituc-csi.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726195904/http://survey07.ituc-csi.org/getcountry.php?IDCountry=THA&amp;IDLang=EN |date=2011-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report detailed various allegations:
{{cquote|Supervisors intensively monitored and penalised union leaders through discriminatory transfers and disciplinary procedures for trumped up infractions. Union committee members were prevented from working overtime, compelled to take unpaid leave, separated from their fellow workers, and publicly humiliated by senior managers, in one case destroying their work then ordering them to fix it. When three union committee members publicly protested against the factory’s actions against workers, the management sued them in court for defamation.

When a union committee member who was pregnant [[miscarriage|miscarried]] during her day shift at the factory, she requested the factory to send her to a local hospital. Management refused, and instead sent her to the medical room at the factory, where she was forced to wait until the evening when a friend from another factory came and took her to hospital for treatment.&lt;ref name="ituc" /&gt;}}
Through such practices, the ITUC argued, Mikasa succeeded in either firing or forcing the resignation of the entire union committee (except the union president), essentially destroying the [[labor rights|right of its workers to organize]].

A separate report, by the Thai Labor Campaign alleged that new Mikasa factory workers received only 173 [[baht]] per day ([[USD|$]]4.36 per day) in 2006.&lt;ref name="tlc"&gt;The Life of Football Factory Workers in Thailand, Junya Lek Yimprasert, Thai Labor Campaign, June 30, 2006, [http://www.cleanclothes.org/documents/Life_football_workers_of_thailand.pdf PDF from CleanClothes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613061029/http://cleanclothes.org/documents/Life_football_workers_of_thailand.pdf |date=2010-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohamed Bin Abdulrahman Al-Hassan Al-Fakhro'''  (Arabic: محمد بن عبدالرحمن بن محمد بن حسن بن محمود آل فخرو) ,(nicknamed "'''Half of the World Arabic: نص الدنيا'''") was a wealthy businessman from [[Qatar]]. He fought in the Zubara War of 1935 with the [[Al-Thani|Al Thani]]. He was given his nickname by the then ruler of Qatar, [[Sheikh]] [[Abdullah bin Jasssim Al Thani]] for his vast knowledge and wisdom. Shaikh Abdulla Bin Jassim also considered him to be his right-hand man. He was said to have brought two cannons (still standing in front of Zubara Fort) from India on-board his uncle's ships after smuggling gold coins (sewed into his vest), because in those days it was forbidden by the English to smuggle gold out of the [[Persian Gulf]] area.
In 1948 he moved to live in Bahrain, due to his second marriage, whom her father [[Yousif bin Abdulrahman Fakhro]] ( Yousif Al Aoud) insisted that she doesn't leave Bahrain as he loved her and always wanted her close to him.

In his house in Qatar which remains till date after the State of Qatar decided to renovate it part of the full renovation of 2006 of [[Souq Waqif]], and the house now named as Bayt Fakhro by HH Shaikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani (the father Amir), it was known that on average 4 times a week HH Shaikh Abdulla bin Jassim Al Thani used to have his afternoon naps in Bayt Fakhro in the top room named by him as the (GHURAIFA).

Mohamed, remained commuting between both Bahrain and Qatar during his life. It was also known that whenever Shaikh Abdulla bin Jassim Al Thani and Shaikh Ali bin Abdulla Al Thani Ruler of Qatari at the time visited Bahrain on official or non official trips he would only stay at the House of Mohamed bin Abdulrahman Fakhro due to their close relationship and the respect they hold for each other. And refuses to stay at the Amiri Palace.

==Later life==
Later in life, he was in charge of overseeing the education of the sons and nephews of Sheikh Abdullah bin Jasssim Al Thani, Sheikh [[Ahmad bin Ali Al Thani]], Sheikh [[Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani]], Sheikh [[Suhaim bin Hamad Al Thani]], Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani|Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani]]; Sheikh [[Khalid bin Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani]], as well as others. While less involved in politics, he continued to enjoy strong relationships with the Rulers and Sheikhs of Qatar up until his death. Sheikh [[Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]] and the late Emir Sheikh. [[Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa]], both rulers of Bahrain, also continued to hold him as a man of wisdom and a trusted advisor.

==His origins==
Mohammed bin Abdulrahman belongs to the Al-Hassan branch from Al-Fakhro family which is attributed to the Banu-Tamim tribe. This family is considered to be highly respected by the leaders of the GCC as well as other families and tribes; they are Sunni Arabs. Some members of this family have played major roles in the political, economic, and social lives of the GCC. In addition, they are considered to be very close to the ruling families in Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.

==Progeny==
He had nine sons: Dr. Ali (Former Misniter of Health and Education in Bahrain); Dr. Hassan, Jassim (died 2001); Abdulaziz, Khalid (Advisor to Bahrain Prime Minister Court); Abdulrahman (Businessman), Adnan (Undersecretary–Bahrain Ministry of Electricity and Water); Yousif (Businessman); Jamal (Deputy Chairman [[Shura Council]] - Bahrain); and one daughter.

'''Retail''' is the process of selling [[consumer goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] to customers through multiple [[distribution channel|channels of distribution]] to earn a profit. '''Retailers''' satisfy demand identified through a [[supply chain]]. The term "retailer" is typically applied where a service provider fills the small orders of a large number of individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a small number of [[wholesale]], [[corporate]] or government clientele. [[Shopping]] generally refers to the act of [[Trade|buying]] products. Sometimes this is done to obtain [[final goods]], including necessities such as food and clothing; sometimes it takes place as a [[recreation]]al activity. Recreational shopping often involves [[window shopping]] and browsing: it does not always result in a purchase.

Retail markets and shops have a very ancient history, dating back to antiquity. Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant [[peddler]]s. Over the centuries, retail shops were transformed from little more than "rude booths" to the sophisticated shopping malls of the modern era.

Most modern retailers typically make a variety of [[corporate strategy|strategic level]] decisions including the type of [[retail shop|store]], the [[market (economics)|market]] to be served, the optimal [[product (business)|product]] assortment, [[customer service]], supporting services and the store's overall market positioning. Once the strategic retail plan is in place, retailers devise the retail mix which includes product, price, place, promotion, personnel and presentation. In the [[digital age]], an increasing number of retailers are seeking to reach broader markets by selling through multiple channels, including both [[bricks and mortar store|bricks and mortar]] and [[Online shopping|online retailing]]. Digital technologies are also changing the way that [[consumer]]s pay for goods and services. Retailing support services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, stylist services and a range of other supporting services.

Retail shops occur in a diverse range of types and in many different contexts&amp;nbsp;– from [[strip mall|strip shopping centres]] in [[residential area|residential streets]] through to large, indoor [[shopping mall]]s. [[Shopping streets]] may restrict traffic to pedestrians only. Sometimes a shopping street has a partial or full [[roof]] to create a more comfortable shopping environment – protecting customers from various types of weather conditions such as extreme temperatures, winds or [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Forms of non-shop retailing include online retailing (a type of '''electronic-commerce''' used for '''business-to-consumer''' ('''B2C''') transactions) and [[mail order]].

==Etymology==
Retail comes from the Old French word ''tailler'', which means "to cut off, clip, pare, divide" in terms of tailoring (1365). It was first recorded as a noun with the meaning of a "sale in small quantities" in 1433 (from the Middle French ''retail'', "piece cut off, shred, scrap, paring").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|retail|accessdate=2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the French, the word, ''retail'', in both Dutch and German, also refers to the sale of small quantities of items.

==Definition and explanation==

Retail refers to the activity of reselling. A retailer is any person or organisation is a reseller who sells goods or services directly to consumers or end-users.&lt;ref&gt;The Free Dictionary, &lt;Online: https://www.thefreedictionary.com/retail&lt;/ref&gt; Some retailers may sell to business customers, and such sales are termed ''non-retail activity.'' In some jurisdictions or regions, legal definitions of retail specify that at least 80 percent of sales activity must be to end-users.&lt;ref&gt;Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C. Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S. Niininen, O. and Casidy, R., ''Marketing Principles'', 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018,  pp 449-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Retailing often occurs in retail stores or service establishments, but may also occur through direct selling such as through vending machines, door-to-door sales or electronic channels.&lt;ref&gt;Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C. Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S. Niininen, O. and Casidy, R., ''Marketing Principles'', 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018,  p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the idea of retail is often associated with the purchase of goods, the term may be applied to service-providers that sell to consumers. Retail service providers include retail banking, tourism, insurance, private healthcare, private education, private security firms, legal firms, publishers, public transport and others. For example, a tourism provider might have a retail division that books travel and accommodation for consumers plus a wholesale division that purchases blocks of accommodation, hospitality, transport and sightseeing which are subsequently packaged into a holiday tour for sale to retail travel agents.

Some retailers badge their stores as "wholesale outlets" offering "wholesale prices." While this practice may encourage consumers to imagine that they have access to lower prices, while being prepared to trade-off reduced prices for cramped in-store environments, in a strict legal sense, a store that sells the majority of its merchandise direct to consumers, is defined as a retailer rather than a wholesaler. Different jurisdictions set parameters for the ratio of consumer to business sales that define a retail business.

===Retailing in antiquity===
[[File:Traiano mercati.jpg|thumb|Marketplace at Trajan's Forum, the earliest known example of permanent retail shopfronts]] 
Retail markets have existed since ancient times. Archaeological evidence for trade, probably involving barter systems, dates back more than 10,000 years. As civilizations grew, barter was replaced with retail trade involving coinage. Selling and buying is thought to have emerged in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) in around the 7th millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian D. G.; Shaw, Eric H. (2006). "A History of Marketing Thought", ''Handbook of Marketing.'' Weitz, Barton A.; Wensley, Robin (eds), Sage, p. 41, {{ISBN|1-4129-2120-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gharipour points to evidence of primitive shops and trade centres in Sialk Hills in Kashan (6000 BCE), Catalk Huyuk in modern-day Turkey (7,500–5,700 BCE), Jericho (2600 BCE) and Susa (4000 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Gharipour, M., "The Culture and Politics of Commerce", in ''The Bazaar in the Islamic City: Design, Culture, and History'', Mohammad Gharipour (ed.), New York, The American University in Cairo Press, 2012 p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Open air, public markets were known in ancient Babylonia, Assyria, Phoenicia and Egypt. These markets typically occupied a place in the [[town centre|town's centre]]. Surrounding the market, skilled artisans, such as metal-workers and leather workers, occupied permanent premises in alleys that led to the open market-place. These artisans may have sold wares directly from their premises, but also prepared goods for sale on market days.&lt;ref&gt;Bintliff, J., "Going to Market in Antiquity", In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums'', Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, pp. 209–50&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Greece]] markets operated within the [[agora]], an open space where, on market days, goods were displayed on mats or temporary stalls.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, D.B., ''An Ancient Shopping Center: The Athenian Agora'', ASCSA, 1993   pp 19-21&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Roman Empire|ancient Rome]], trade took place in the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]].&lt;ref&gt;McGeough, K.M., ''The Romans: New Perspectives'', ABC-CLIO, 2004, pp 105-106&lt;/ref&gt; Rome had two forums; the [[Roman forum|Forum Romanum]] and [[Trajan's Forum]]. The latter was a vast expanse, comprising multiple buildings with shops on four levels.&lt;ref&gt;Holleran, C., ''Shopping in Ancient Rome: The Retail Trade in the Late Republic and the Late Republic and the Principate'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shop-front.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, P., ''Shopping Environments'', Elsevier, Oxford, 2006, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In antiquity, exchange involved [[direct selling]] via [[merchant]]s or [[peddler]]s and [[barter]]ing systems were commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Phoenicia]]ns, noted for their seafaring skills, plied their ships across the Mediterranean, becoming a major trading power by the 9th century BCE. The Phoenicians imported and exported wood, textiles, glass and produce such as wine, oil, dried fruit and nuts. Their trading skills necessitated a network of colonies along the Mediterranean coast, stretching from modern day Crete through to Tangiers and onto Sardinia&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, M., "Trade in the Phoenician World", ''Ancient History Encyclopedia'', 1 April 2016, &lt;Online: http://www.ancient.eu/article/881&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Phoenicians not only traded in tangible goods, but were also instrumental in transporting culture. The Phoenician's extensive trade networks necessitated considerable book-keeping and correspondence. In around 1500 BCE, the Phoenicians developed a consonantal alphabet which was much easier to learn that the complex scripts used in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Phoenician traders and merchants were largely responsible for spreading their alphabet around the region.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1996) pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenician inscriptions have been found in [[archaeological]] sites at a number of former Phoenician cities and [[colonies]] around the Mediterranean, such as [[Byblos]] (in present-day [[Lebanon]]) and [[Carthage]] in [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/111499sci-alphabet-origin.html|title=Discovery of Egyptian Inscriptions Indicates an Earlier Date for Origin of the Alphabet|website=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Graeco-Roman world, the market primarily served the local peasantry. Local producers, who were generally poor, would sell small surpluses from their individual farming activities, purchase minor farm equipment and also buy a few luxuries for their homes. Major producers such as the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm-gates, obviating the producers' need to attend local markets. The very wealthy landowners managed their own distribution, which may have involved exporting and importing. The nature of export markets in antiquity is well documented in ancient sources and archaeological case studies.&lt;ref&gt;Bintliff, J., "Going to Market in Antiquity", In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums'', Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans preferred to purchase goods from specific places: oysters from Londinium, cinnamon from a specific mountain in Arabia, and these place-based preferences stimulated trade throughout Europe and the middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Paquet-Byrne, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping'', ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, 2003, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; Markets were also important centres of social life.&lt;ref&gt;ar, F., "The World of the Golden Ass", ''Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 71, 1981, pp. 63–67&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of retailing and marketing in England and Europe has been extensively studied, but less is known about developments elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Southerton, D. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture'', Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2011 p. 888&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, recent research suggests that China exhibited a rich history of early retail systems.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, K. and Reid., S., "The Birth of the Brand: 4000 years of Branding", ''Business History'', Vol. 50, 2008. pp. 419–32.&lt;/ref&gt; From as early as 200 BCE, Chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family, place names and product quality, and the use of government imposed product branding was used between 600 and 900 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, G.M. and Bengtsson. A. "A Brief History of Branding in China", ''Journal of Macromarketing'', Vol, 30, no. 3, 2010, pp. 210–21&lt;/ref&gt; Eckhart and Bengtsson have argued that during the Song Dynasty (960–1127), Chinese society developed a consumerist culture, where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, G.M. and Bengtsson. A. "A Brief History of Branding in China", ''Journal of Macromarketing'', Vol, 30, no. 3, 2010, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of a [[consumer culture]] led to the commercial investment in carefully managed [[company image]], [[signage#RETAIL SIGNAGE|retail signage]], symbolic brands, [[trademark#Registration|trademark protection]] and sophisticated brand concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, G.M. and Bengtsson. A. "A Brief History of Branding in China", ''Journal of Macromarketing'', Vol, 30, no. 3, 2010, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retailing in Medieval Europe===

[[File:The Cross and Rows, Chester, Cheshire, England, ca. 1895.jpg|thumb|right|The Row, Chester, Cheshire, England, c. 1895; a unique medieval shopping arcade]]

In Medieval England and Europe, relatively few permanent shops were to be found; instead customers walked into the tradesman's workshops where they discussed purchasing options directly with tradesmen. In 13th century London, mercers and haberdashers were known to exist and grocers sold "miscellaneous small wares as well as spices and medicines" but fish and other perishables were sold through markets, costermongers, hucksters, peddlers or other type of itinerant vendor.&lt;ref&gt;Thrupp, S.L., ''The Merchant Class of Medieval London, 1300–1500'', pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

In the more populous cities, a small number of shops were beginning to emerge by the 13th century. In [[Chester]], a medieval covered shopping arcade represented a major innovation that attracted shoppers from many miles around. Known as "[[Chester Rows|The Rows"]] this medieval shopping arcade is believed to be the first of its kind in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, N. and Hubbard, E., ''The Buildings of England: Cheshire'' Penguin, 1978, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments of Chester's Medieval Row, which is believed to date to the mid-13th century, can still be found in Cheshire.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, P., ''Building Chester'', Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th or 14th century, another arcade with several shops was recorded at ''Drapery Row'' in Winchester.&lt;ref&gt;Keene, D. and Rumble, A. R., ''Survey of Medieval Winchester'', (Part 1), Oxford University Press, 1985, p. 578&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of street names such as ''Drapery Row'', ''Mercer's Lane'' and ''[[Ironmonger Lane]]'' in the medieval period suggests that permanent shops were becoming more commonplace.

[[File:Fotothek df tg 0007616 Medizin ^ Apotheke.jpg|thumb|left|A typical 17th century shop, with customers being served through an opening onto the street]]

Medieval shops had little in common with their modern equivalent. As late as the 16th century, London's shops were described as little more than "rude booths" and their owners "bawled as loudly as the itinerants."&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C., ''London'', Vol. 5, 1841, Knight &amp; Co, London, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Shopfronts typically had a front door with two wider openings on either side, each covered with shutters. The shutters were designed to open so that the top portion formed a canopy while the bottom was fitted with legs so that it could serve as a shopboard.&lt;ref name="Conlin, J. 2013"&gt;Conlin, J., ''Tales of Two Cities: Paris, London and the Birth of the Modern City'', Atlantic Books, 2013, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Cox and Dannehl suggest that the Medieval shopper's experience was very different. Glazed windows, which were rare during the medieval period, and did not become commonplace until the eighteenth century, meant that shop interiors were dark places. Outside the markets, goods were rarely out on display and the service counter was unknown. Shoppers had relatively few opportunities to inspect the merchandise prior to consumption. Many stores had openings onto the street from which they served customers.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England'', Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the major cities, most consumable purchases were made through markets or fairs. Markets were held daily in the more populous towns and cities or weekly in the more sparsely populated rural districts. Markets sold fresh produce; fruit, vegetables, baked goods, meat, poultry, fish and some ready to eat foodstuffs; while fairs operated on a periodic cycle and were almost always associated with a religious festival.&lt;ref&gt;''Gazetteer of Markets and Fairs in England and Wales to 1516'', The List and Index Society, no. 32, 2003, &lt;Online: http://www.history.ac.uk/cmh/gaz/gazweb2.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Fairs sold non-perishables such as farm tools, homewares, furniture, rugs and ceramics. Market towns dotted the medieval European landscape while itinerant vendors supplied less populated areas or hard-to-reach districts. Peddlers and other itinerant vendors operated alongside other types of retail for centuries. The political philosopher, [[John Stuart Mill]] compared the convenience of markets/fairs to that of the itinerant peddlers:

:"The contrivance of fairs and markets was early had recourse to, where consumers and producers might periodically meet, without any intermediate agency; and this plan answers tolerably well for many articles, especially agricultural produce … but were inconvenient to buyers who have other occupations, and do not live in the immediate vicinity … and the wants of the consumers must either be provided for so long beforehand, or must remain so long unsupplied, that even before the resources of society admitted of the establishment of shops, the supply of these wants fell universally into the hands of itinerant dealers: the pedlar, who might appear once a month, being preferred to the fair, which only returned once or twice a year."&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J.S., ''Principles of a Political Economy'', London, Longman, 1909, Bk. I, Ch. II&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arnout de muyser.jpg|thumb|''Fruit and Vegetable Market'', Painting by [[Arnout de Muyser]]. c. 1590]]

Blintiff has investigated the early Medieval networks of market towns across Europe, and suggests that by the 12th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional, different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns.&lt;ref&gt;Bintliff, J., "Going to Market in Antiquity", In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums'', Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Market-places appear to have emerged independently outside Europe. The [[Grand Bazaar, Istanbul|Grand Bazaar]] in [[Istanbul]] is often cited as the world's oldest continuously-operating market; its construction began in 1455. The Spanish conquistadors wrote glowingly of markets in the Americas. In the 15th century the [[Mexica]] ([[Aztec]]) market of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]] was the largest in all the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rebecca M. Seaman|title=Conflict in the Early Americas: An Encyclopedia of the Spanish Empire's ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXKjAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA375|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English market towns were regulated from a relatively early period. The English monarchs awarded a ''charter'' to local Lords to create markets and fairs for a town or village. This charter would grant the lords the right to take tolls and also afford some protection from rival markets. For example, once a chartered market was granted for specific market days, a nearby rival market could not open on the same days.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, C., ''Everyday Life in Medieval England'', London, Hambledon and London, 1994, pp. 283–303&lt;/ref&gt; Across the boroughs of England, a network of chartered markets sprang up between the 12th and 16th centuries, giving consumers reasonable choice in the markets they preferred to patronise.&lt;ref&gt;Borsay, P. and Proudfoot, L., ''Provincial Towns in Early Modern England and Ireland: Change, Convergence and Divergence, '' [The British Academy], Oxford University Press, 2002, pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; A study on the purchasing habits of the monks and other individuals in medieval England, suggests that consumers of the period were relatively discerning. Purchase decisions were based on purchase criteria such as consumers' perceptions of the range, quality, and price of goods. This informed decisions about where to make their purchases and which markets were superior.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, M. and Lee, J., "The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective", ''Business History Review'', Vol, 85, Spring 2011, {{doi|10.1017/S0007680511000018}}, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Today, traders and showmen jealously guard the reputation of these historic market charters.

Braudel and Reynold have made a systematic study of these European market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century. Their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were common in larger cities. Gradually over time, permanent shops with regular trading days began to supplant the periodic markets, while peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution. The physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and the economy was characterised by local trading. Braudel reports that, in 1600, goods travelled relatively short distances&amp;nbsp;– grain 5–10 miles; cattle 40–70 miles; wool and woollen cloth 20–40 miles. Following the European age of discovery, goods were imported from afar&amp;nbsp;– calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., ''The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century'', Berkely, CA, University of California Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

English essayist, [[Joseph Addison]], writing in 1711, described the exotic origin of produce available to English society in the following terms:

:"Our Ships are laden with the Harvest of every Climate: Our Tables are stored with Spices, and Oils, and Wines: Our Rooms are filled with Pyramids of China, and adorned with the Workmanship of Japan: Our Morning's Draught comes to us from the remotest Corners of the Earth: We repair our Bodies by the Drugs of America, and repose ourselves under Indian Canopies. My Friend Sir ANDREW calls the Vineyards of France our Gardens; the Spice-Islands our Hot-beds; the Persians our Silk-Weavers, and the Chinese our Potters. Nature indeed furnishes us with the bare Necessaries of Life, but Traffick gives us greater Variety of what is Useful, and at the same time supplies us with every thing that is Convenient and Ornamental."&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectator'', 19 May 1711, The Spectator Project, &lt;Online:http://www2.scc.rutgers.edu/spectator/text/may1711/no69.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Luca Clerici has made a detailed study of [[Vicenza]]’s food market during the sixteenth century. He found that there were many different types of reseller operating out of the markets. For example, in the dairy trade, cheese and butter was sold by the members of two craft guilds (i.e., cheesemongers who were shopkeepers) and that of the so-called ‘resellers’ (hucksters selling a wide range of foodstuffs), and by other sellers who were not enrolled in any guild. Cheesemongers’ shops were situated at the town hall and were very lucrative. Resellers and direct sellers increased the number of sellers, thus increasing competition, to the benefit of consumers. Direct sellers, who brought produce from the surrounding countryside, sold their wares through the central market place and priced their goods at considerably lower rates than cheesemongers.&lt;ref&gt;Clerici, L., "Le prix du bien commun. Taxation des prix et approvisionnement urbain (Vicence, XVIe-XVIIe siècle)" [The price of the common good. Official prices and urban provisioning in sixteenth and seventeenth century Vicenza] in I prezzi delle cose nell’età preindustriale /''The Prices of Things in Pre-Industrial Times'', [forthcoming], Firenze University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retailing in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries===
[[File:Ana Marie Wirth Apotheke.jpg|thumb|left|The retail service counter was an innovation of the eighteenth century]]

By the 17th century, permanent shops with more regular trading hours were beginning to supplant markets and fairs as the main retail outlet. Provincial shopkeepers were active in almost every English market town. These shopkeepers sold general merchandise, much like a contemporary convenience store or a general store. For example, William Allen, a mercer in Tamworth who died in 1604, sold spices alongside furs and fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England'', Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p,. 129&lt;/ref&gt; William Stout of Lancaster retailed sugar, tobacco, nails and prunes at both his shop and at the central markets. His autobiography reveals that he spent most of his time preparing products for sale at the central market, which brought an influx of customers into town.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England'', Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

As the number of shops grew, they underwent a transformation. The trappings of a modern shop, which had been entirely absent from the sixteenth and early seventeenth century store, gradually made way for store interiors and shopfronts that are more familiar to modern shoppers. Prior to the eighteenth century, the typical retail store had no counter, display cases, chairs, mirrors, changing-rooms, etc. However, the opportunity for the customer to browse merchandise, touch and feel products began to be available, with retail innovations from the late 17th and early 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England'', Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, pp. 153–54&lt;/ref&gt; Glazing was widely used from the early 18th-century. English commentators pointed to the speed at which glazing was installed, Daniel Defoe, writing in 1726, noted that "Never was there such painting and guildings, such sashings and looking-glasses as the shopkeepers as there is now."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Conlin, J., ''Tales of Two Cities: Paris, London and the Birth of the Modern City'', Atlantic Books, 2013, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the major metropolitan cities, few stores could afford to serve one type of clientele exclusively. However, gradually retail shops introduced innovations that would allow them to separate wealthier customers from the "riff raff." One technique was to have a window opening out onto the street from which customers could be served. This allowed the sale of goods to the common people, without encouraging them to come inside. Another solution, that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century was to invite favoured customers into a back-room of the store, where goods were permanently on display. Yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeeper's private home for the benefit of wealthier clients. Samuel Pepys, for example, writing in 1660, describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England'', Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, pp. 155–59&lt;/ref&gt; The eighteenth century English entrepreneurs, [[Josiah Wedgewood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]], both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls.&lt;ref&gt;McKendrick, N., Brewer, J. and Plumb . J.H., ''The Birth of a Consumer Society: The Commercialization of Eighteenth Century England'', London, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Savitt has argued that by the eighteenth century, American merchants, who had been operating as importers and exporters, began to specialise in either wholesale or retail roles. They tended not to specialise in particular types of merchandise, often trading as general merchants, selling a diverse range of product types. These merchants were concentrated in the larger cities. They often provided high levels of credit financing for retail transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Savitt, R., "Looking Back to See Ahead: Writing the History of American Retailing", in ''Retailing: The Evolution and Development of Retailing'', A. M. Findlay, Leigh Sparks (eds), pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galeries de bois (ancien camp des Tartares), au Palais-Royal, 1825.jpg|thumb|left|Galeries de bois at au Palais-Royal, one of the earliest shopping arcades in Europe]]

By the late eighteenth century, grand shopping arcades began to emerge across Europe and in the Antipodes. A shopping arcade refers to a multiple-vendor space, operating under a covered roof. Typically, the roof was constructed of glass to allow for natural light and to reduce the need for candles or electric lighting. Some of the earliest examples of shopping arcade appeared in Paris, due its lack of pavement for pedestrians. Retailers, eager to attract window shoppers by providing a shopping environment away from the filthy streets, began to construct rudimentary arcades. Opening in 1771, the ''Coliseé'', situated on the Champs Elysee, consisted of three arcades, each with ten shops, all running off a central ballroom. For Parisians, the location was seen as too remote and the arcade closed within two years of opening.&lt;ref name="Conlin, J. 2013"/&gt; Inspired by the souks of Arabia, the Galerie de Bois, a series of wooden shops linked the ends of the Palais Royal, opened in 1786 and became a central part of Parisian social life.&lt;ref&gt;Conlin, J., ''Tales of Two Cities: Paris, London and the Birth of the Modern City'', Atlantic Books, 2013, Chapter 2; Willsher, K., "Paris's Galeries de Bois, Prototype of the Modern Shopping Centre", [A history of cities in 50 buildings, day 6], 30 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect, Bertrand Lemoine, described the period, 1786 to 1935, as ''l’Ère des passages couverts'' (the Arcade Era).&lt;ref&gt;Lemoine, B., ''Les Passages Couverts'', Paris: Délégation à l'action artistique de la ville de Paris [AAVP], 1990. {{ISBN|9782905118219}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the European capitals, shopping arcades spread across the continent, reaching their heyday in the early 19th century: the [[Palais Royal]] in Paris (opened in 1784); Passage de Feydeau in Paris (opened in 1791) and Passage du Claire in 1799.&lt;ref name="Conlin, J. 2013"/&gt; London's [[Piccadilly Arcade]] (opened in 1810); Paris's Passage Colbert (1826) and Milan's [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II|Galleria Vittorio Emanuele]] (1878).&lt;ref&gt;Sassatelli, R., ''Consumer Culture: History, Theory and Politics'', Sage, 2007, p. 27; Although the author specifically names Piccadilly Arcade, it is possible that she intended [[Burlington Arcade]] in Piccadilly.&lt;/ref&gt; Designed to attract the genteel middle class, arcade retailers sold luxury goods at relatively high prices. However, prices were never a deterrent, as these new arcades came to be the place to shop and to be seen. Arcades offered shoppers the promise of an enclosed space away from the chaos that characterised the noisy, dirty streets; a warm, dry space away from the elements, and a safe-haven where people could socialise and spend their leisure time. As thousands of glass covered arcades spread across Europe, they became grander and more ornately decorated. By the mid nineteenth century, they had become prominent centres of fashion and social life. Promenading in these arcades became a popular nineteenth century pass-time for the emerging middle classes. The ''Illustrated Guide to Paris'' of 1852 summarized the appeal of arcades in the following description:
[[File:Burlington Arcade by Thomas Hosmer Shepherd 1827-28.JPG|thumb|right|The Piccadilly entrance to the Burlington Arcade in 1827–28, shortly after its opening]]
: "In speaking of the inner boulevards, we have made mention again and again of the arcades which open onto them. These arcades, a recent invention of industrial luxury, are glass-roofed, marble-paneled corridors extending through whole blocks of buildings, whose owners have joined together for such enterprises. Lining both sides of these corridors, which get their light from above, are the most elegant shops, so that the arcade is a city, a world in miniature, in which customers will find everything they need."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Woodward, R. B., "Making a Pilgrimage to Cathedrals of Commerce", ''The New York Times'', 11 March 2007, &lt;Online: https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/travel/11culture.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palais-Royal, which opened to Parisians in 1784 and became one of the most important marketplaces in Paris, is generally regarded as the earliest example in the grand shopping arcades.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, I., ''Tradition and Innovation in English Retailing, 1700 to 1850'', Routledge, Oxon, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The Palais-Royal was a complex of gardens, shops and entertainment venues situated on the external perimeter of the grounds, under the original colonnades. The area boasted some 145 boutiques, cafés, salons, hair salons, bookshops, museums, and numerous refreshment kiosks as well as two theatres. The retail outlets specialised in luxury goods such as fine jewellery, furs, paintings and furniture designed to appeal to the wealthy elite. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex were among the first in Europe to abandon the system of bartering, and adopt fixed-prices thereby sparing their clientele the hassle of bartering. Stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, frequented by both the aristocracy and the middle classes. It developed a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation, revolving around the salons, cafés, and bookshops, but also became a place frequented by off-duty soldiers and was a favourite haunt of prostitutes, many of whom rented apartments in the building.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping'', ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 90–93&lt;/ref&gt; London's [[Burlington Arcade]], which opened in 1819, positioned itself as an elegant and exclusive venue from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping'', ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 92–95&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable nineteenth century grand arcades include the [[Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert]] in Brussels which was inaugurated in 1847, Istanbul's [[Çiçek Pasajı]] opened in 1870 and Milan's [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]] first opened in 1877. Shopping arcades were the precursor to the modern shopping mall.

[[File:ToadLane2009.jpg|thumb|left|The original Toad Lane Store, Rochdale, Manchester; one of Britain's earliest co-operative stores]]
While the arcades were the province of the bourgeoisie, a new type of retail venture emerged to serve the needs of the working poor. [[John Stuart Mill]] wrote about the rise of the [[consumers' co-operative|co-operative]] retail store, which he witnessed first-hand in the mid-nineteenth century. Stuart Mill locates these co-operative stores within a broader [[History of the cooperative movement|co-operative movement]] which was prominent in the industrial city of Manchester and in the counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire. He documents one of the early co-operative retail stores in [[Rochdale]] in Manchester, England, "In 1853, the Store purchased for £745, a warehouse (freehold) on the opposite side of the street, where they keep and retail their stores of flour, butcher's meat, potatoes, and kindred articles." Stuart Mill also quoted a contemporary commentator who wrote of the benefits of the co-operative store:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Buyer and seller meet as friends; there is no overreaching on one side, and no suspicion on the other... These crowds of humble working men, who never knew before when they put good food in their mouths, whose every dinner was adulterated, whose shoes let in the water a month too soon, whose waistcoats shone with devil's dust, and whose wives wore calico that would not wash, now buy in the markets like millionaires, and as far as pureness of food goes, live like lords.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J. S., ''Principles of a Political Economy with some of their Applications to Social Philosophy'', 7th ed., London, Longman, 1909, Section IV.7.53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Retailing in the modern era===
[[File:AA446b copy.jpeg|thumb|Department stores, such as [[Le Bon Marché]] of France, appeared from the mid nineteenth century]]

The modern era of retailing is defined as the period from the industrial revolution to the 21st-century.&lt;ref&gt;''Reshaping Retail: Why Technology is Transforming the Industry and How to Win in the New Consumer Dr''&lt;/ref&gt; In major cities, the [[department store]] emerged in the mid to late 19th-century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and redefined concepts of service and luxury. The term, "department store" originated in America. In 19th century England, these stores were known as emporia or warehouse shops.&lt;ref&gt;Koot, G.M.",Shops and Shopping in Britain: from market stalls to chain stores", University of Dartmouth, 2011, &lt;Online: https://www1.umassd.edu/ir/resources/consumption/shopping.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In London, the first department stores appeared in Oxford Street and Regent Street, where they formed part of a distinctly modern shopping precinct.&lt;ref&gt;Iarocci, L., ''Visual Merchandising: The Image of Selling'', Ashgate Publishing, 2013, pp 120-121&lt;/ref&gt; When London draper, [[William Whiteley]] attempted to transform his Bayswater drapery store into a department store by adding a meat and vegetable department and an Oriental Department in around 1875, he met with extreme resistance from other shop-keepers, who resented that he was encroaching on their territory and poaching their customers.&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport. E.D., "The Halls of Temptation: Gender, Politics, and the Construction of the Department Store in Late Victorian London", ''Journal of British Studies'', Vol. 35, No. 1, 1996, pp. 58-83 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/175745?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;  Before long, however, major department stores began to open across the US, Britain and Europe from the mid-nineteenth century including; Harrod's of London in 1834; Kendall's in Manchester in 1836; [[Selfridges]] of London in 1909; Macy's of New York in 1858; [[Bloomingdale's]] in 1861; [[Sak's Fifth Avenue|Sak's]] in 1867; [[J.C. Penney]] in 1902; [[Le Bon Marché]] of France in 1852 and [[Galeries Lafayette]] of France in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, V., ''From Main Street to Mall: The Rise and Fall of the American Department Store'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2015, Chapter 1; Lindgren, Y., Reynolds, S., ''Paris-Edinburgh: Cultural Connections in the Belle Epoque'', Routledge, 2016, p. 41; ''All Above Board: Creating The Ideal Corporate Board'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Other twentieth century innovations in retailing included chain stores, [[mail-order]], [[multi-level marketing]] (pyramid selling or network marketing, {{circa}} 1920s), [[party plan]]s ({{circa}} 1930s) and [[B2C]] [[e-commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;Coopey, R., O'Connell, S. and Porter, D., ''Mail Order Retailing in Britain: A Business and Social History'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 100; Coleman, M.J. and Ganong, L.G. (eds), ''The Social History of the American Family: An Encyclopedia'', Volume 1, Sage, 2014, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the early department stores were more than just a retail emporium; rather they were venues where shoppers could spend their leisure time and be entertained. Some department stores offered reading rooms, art galleries and concerts. Most department stores had tea-rooms or dining rooms and offered treatment areas where ladies could indulge in a manicure. The fashion show, which originated in the US in around 1907, became a staple feature event for many department stores and celebrity appearances were also used to great effect. Themed events featured wares from foreign shores, exposing shoppers to the exotic cultures of the Orient and Middle-East.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Moss, M., ''Shopping as an Entertainment Experience'', Plymouth, Lexington Books, pp. 35–39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vaires Carrefour market.jpg|thumb|left|In 1963, [[Carrefour]] opened the first [[hypermarket]] in St Genevieve-de-Bois, near Paris,]]
During this period, retailers worked to develop modern retail marketing practices. Pioneering merchants who contributed to modern retail marketing and management methods include: [[A. T. Stewart]], [[Potter Palmer]], [[John Wanamaker]], [[Aaron Montgomery Ward|Montgomery Ward]], [[Marshall Field]], [[Richard Warren Sears]], [[Rowland Macy]], [[James Cash Penney|J.C.

Retail, using mail order, came of age during the mid-19th century. Although catalogue sales had been used since the 15th century, this method of retailing was confined to a few industries such as the sale of books and seeds. However, improvements in transport and postal services, led several entrepreneurs on either side of the Atlantic to experiment with catalogue sales. In 1861, Welsh draper [[Pryce Pryce-Jones]] sent catalogues to clients who could place orders for flannel clothing which was then despatched by post. This enabled Pryce-Jones to extend his client base across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein. J., ''101 Amazing Facts about Wales'', Andrews, UK, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, the US retailer, Montgomery Ward also devised a catalogue sales and mail-order system. His first catalogue which was issued in August 1872 consisted of an 8&amp;nbsp;in × 12&amp;nbsp;in (20&amp;nbsp;cm × 30&amp;nbsp;cm) single-sheet price list, listing 163 items for sale with ordering instructions for which Ward had written the copy. He also devised the catch-phrase "satisfaction guaranteed or your money back" which was implemented in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Hevrde, J., "Montgomery Ward's First Catalog", ''Chicago Tribune'', 31 January 2017, &lt;Online: Hevrdejshttp://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-firstcatalog-story-story.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1890s, [[Sears|Sears and Roebuck]] were also using mail order with great success.

Edward Filene, a proponent of the scientific approach to retail management, developed the concept of the ''automatic bargain Basement''. Although Filene's basement was not the first ‘bargain basement’ in the U.S., the principles of ‘automatic mark-downs’ generated excitement and proved very profitable. Under Filene's plan, merchandise had to be sold within 30 days or it was marked down; after a further 12 days, the merchandise was further reduced by 25% and if still unsold after another 18 days, a further markdown of 25% was applied. If the merchandise remained unsold after two months, it was given to charity.&lt;ref&gt;"Pioneers in Marketing: Edward A. Filene, Lincoln Filene and Daniel Bloomfield", ''Journal of Marketing'', Vol. 23, No. 3, 1959, pp. 296–300&lt;/ref&gt; Filene was a pioneer in employee relations. He instituted a profit sharing program, a minimum wage for women, a 40-hour work week, health clinics and paid vacations. He also played an important role in encouraging the Filene Cooperative Association, "perhaps the earliest American company union". Through this channel he engaged constructively with his employees in collective bargaining and arbitration processes.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, Y., "Edward Filene: Pioneer of Social Responsibility", ''Jewish Currents'', September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Warsaw ochota Blue City01.JPG|thumb|Shopping mall in Warsaw, Poland]]

In the post-war period, an American architect, [[Victor Gruen]] developed a concept for a shopping mall; a planned, self-contained shopping complex complete with an indoor plaza, statues, planting schemes, piped music, and car-parking. Gruen's vision was to create a shopping atmosphere where people felt so comfortable, they would spend more time in the environment, thereby enhancing opportunities for purchasing. The first of these malls opened at [[Northland Center (Michigan)|Northland Mall]] near Detroit in 1954. He went on to design some 50 such malls. Due to the success of the mall concept, Gruen was described as "the most influential architect of the twentieth century by a journalist in the New Yorker."&lt;ref name=NYer04&gt;Malcolm Gladwell, [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/03/15/040315fa_fact1 The Terrazzo Jungle], ''The New Yorker'', March 15, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the twentieth century, a trend towards larger store footprints became discernible. The average size of a U.S. supermarket grew from {{Convert|31000|sqft|m2}} square feet in 1991 to {{Convert|44000|sqft|m2}} square feet in 2000. In 1963, Carrefour opened the first [[hypermarket]] in St Genevieve-de-Bois, near Paris, France.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping'', ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the twentieth century, stores were using labels such as "mega-stores" and "warehouse" stores to reflect their growing size. In Australia, for example, the popular hardware chain, Bunnings has shifted from smaller "home centres" (retail floor space under {{Convert|5000|m2|sqft}}) to "warehouse" stores (retail floor space between {{Convert|5000|m2|sqft}} and {{Convert|21000|m2|sqft}}) in order to accommodate a wider range of goods and in response to population growth and changing consumer preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, S., “Bunnings Shifts Focus as it Upsizes Store Network", ''The Age'', 3 June 2015 &lt;Online:  http://www.theage.com.au/business/bunnings-shifts-focus-as-it-upsizes-store-network-2&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The upward trend of increasing retail space was not consistent across nations, and led in the early 21st century to a 2-fold difference in square footage per capita between the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Death of Retail is Greatly Exaggerated|last=Wahba|first=Phil|date=15 June 2017|work=Fortune|access-date=|page=34|type=Print magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 21st century takes shape, some indications suggest that large retail stores have come under increasing pressure from online sales models and that reductions in store size are evident.&lt;ref&gt;Wetherell, S., "The Shopping Mall’s Socialist Pre-History", Jacobin Magazine, 4 August 2014 &lt;Online: https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/04/the-last-shopping-mall&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Under such competition and other issues such as business debt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Townsend|first1=Matt|last2=Surane|first2=Jenny|last3=Orr|first3=Emma|last4=Cannon|first4=Christopher|title=America’s ‘Retail Apocalypse’ Is Really Just Beginning|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-retail-debt/|accessdate=15 January 2018|publisher=Bloomberg|date=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been a noted business disruption called the [[retail apocalypse]] in recent years which several retail businesses, especially in North America, are sharply reducing their number of stores, or going out of business entirely.

==Retail strategy==
{{See also|Strategic planning}}

[[File:Supermarket check out.JPG|thumb|left|Retailers make many strategic decisions&amp;nbsp;– store type, market served, product assortment and customer services]]

The distinction between "strategic" and "managerial" decision-making is commonly used to distinguish "two phases having different goals and based on different conceptual tools. Strategic planning concerns the choice of policies aiming at improving the competitive position of the firm, taking account of challenges and opportunities proposed by the competitive environment. On the other hand, managerial decision-making is focused on the implementation of specific targets."&lt;ref&gt;Volpato, G. and Stocchetti, A., "Old and new approaches to marketing: The quest of their epistemological roots", MPRA Paper No. 30841, 2009, &lt;Online: https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/30841&gt;, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

In retailing, the strategic plan is designed to set out the [[Vision statement|vision]] and provide guidance for retail decision-makers and provide an outline of how the product and service mix will optimize customer satisfaction. As part of the strategic planning process, it is customary for strategic planners to carry out a detailed environmental scan which seeks to identify trends and opportunities in the competitive environment, market environment, economic environment and statutory-political environment. The retail strategy is normally devised or reviewed every 3– 5 years by the chief executive officer.

The strategic retail analysis typically includes following elements:&lt;ref&gt;Lambda, A.J., ''The Art Of Retailing'', McGraw-Hill, (2003), 2008, pp. 315–26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lanvin Monte Carlo 2004.jpg|thumb|The retailer also considers the overall strategic position and retail image]]

; * Evaluation of the economics of the strategy
:: Cost-benefit analysis of planned activities

At the conclusion of the retail analysis, the retail marketers should have a clear idea of which groups of customers are to be the target of marketing activities. Retail research studies suggest that there is a strong relationship between a store's positioning and the socio-economic status of customers.&lt;ref&gt;Fill,  C., ''Marketing Communications: Framework, Theories and Application'', London, Prentice Hall, 1995, p. 70; {{Cite news|url=https://www.jsbmarketresearch.com/retail|title=Retail Market Research Reports {{!}} Retail Market Reports|last=Ltd.|first=JSB Market Research Pvt|work=JSB Market Research|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the retail strategy, including service quality, has a significant and positive association with customer loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Yu-Jia, H. (2012). The Moderating Effect of Brand Equity and the Mediating Effect of Marketing Mix Strategy On the Relationship Between Service Quality and Customer Loyalty. International Journal of Organizational Innovation, 155-162.&lt;/ref&gt; A marketing strategy effectively outlines all key aspects of firms' targeted audience, demographics, preferences. In a highly competitive market, the retail strategy sets up long-term sustainability. It focuses on customer relationships, stressing the importance of added value, customer satisfaction and highlights how the store's market positioning appeals to targeted groups of customers.&lt;ref&gt;Morschett, D., Swoboda, B. and Schramm, H., "Competitive Strategies in Retailing: An Investigation of the Applicability of Porter’s Framework for Food Retailers ''Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services'', Vol. 13, 2006, pp 275–287&lt;/ref&gt;

==The retail marketing mix==
[[File:Retail mix.jpg|thumb|The retail marketing mix or the 6 Ps of retailing]]

See also [[product management]]; [[promotion mix]]; [[marketing mix]]; [[price]]; [[servicescape]]s and [[retail design]]

Once the strategic plan is in place, retail managers turn to the more managerial aspects of planning. A retail mix is devised for the purpose of coordinating day-to-day tactical decisions. The retail marketing mix typically consists of six broad decision layers including product decisions, place decisions, promotion, price, personnel and presentation (also known as physical evidence).&lt;ref&gt;Monash University, Dictionary, https://business.monash.edu/marketing/marketing-dictionary/r/retail-mix&lt;/ref&gt; The retail mix is loosely based on the [[marketing mix]], but has been expanded and modified in line with the unique needs of the retail context. A number of scholars have argued for an expanded marketing, mix with the inclusion of two new Ps, namely, ''Personnel'' and ''Presentation'' since these contribute to the customer's unique retail experience and are the principal basis for retail differentiation. Yet other scholars argue that the ''Retail Format'' (i.e. retail formula) should be included.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinides, E., "The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing", ''Journal of Marketing Management'', Vo. 22, 2006, pp 422-423&lt;/ref&gt; The modified retail marketing mix that is most commonly cited in text-books is often called the ''6 Ps of retailing'' (see diagram at right).&lt;ref&gt;Berens, J.S., "The Marketing Mix, the Retailing Mix and the Use of Retail Strategy Continua", ''Proceedings of the 1983 Academy of Marketing Science (AMS)'', [Part of the series Developments in Marketing Science], pp. 323–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, C.W., Hair, J.F. and McDaniel, C., ''MKTG 2010'', Mason, OH, Cengage, pp. 193–94&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product===
See [[Product management]]

The primary product-related decisions facing the retailer are the product assortment (what product lines, how many lines and which brands to carry); the type of customer service (high contact through to self-service) and the availability of support services (e.g. credit terms, delivery services, after sales care). These decisions depend on careful analysis of the market, demand, competition as well as the retailer's skills and expertise.

====Product assortment====
[[File:Supermarket full of goods.jpg|thumb|left|A typical supermarket carries an assortment of between 30,000 and 60,000 different products]]

The term product assortment refers to the combination of both product breadth and depth. The main characteristics of a company's product assortment are:&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/product-assortment.html&lt;/ref&gt;

;(1) the length or number of products lines
: the number of different products carried by a store
;(2) the breadth
: refers to the variety of product lines that a store offers. It is also known as product assortment width, merchandise breadth, and product line width.:
;(3) depth or number of product varieties within a product line
: the number of each item or particular styles carried by a store
;(4) consistency
: how products relate to each other in a retail environment.
For a retailer, finding the right balance between breadth and depth can be a key to success. An average supermarket might carry 30,000–60,000 different product lines (product length or assortment), but might carry up to 100 different types of toothpaste (product depth).&lt;ref&gt;Broniarczyk, S.M., "Product Assortment", in ''Handbook of Consumer Psychology'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Speciality retailers typically carry fewer product lines, perhaps as few as 20 lines, but will normally stock greater depth. Costco, for example, carries 5,000 different lines while [[Aldi]] carries just 1,400 lines per store.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Berman, "5 Ways Retailers Can Make More Profit By Reducing Product Assortment &amp; Managing Websales Like Costco Does", 20 November 2012, http://upstreamcommerce.com/blog/2012/11/20/5-ways-retailers-profit-reducing-product-assortment-managing-websales-costco&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aldi Zurmaiener Straße.jpg|thumb|Discount grocery retailer, [[Aldi]], has successfully trimmed the number of product lines it carries to about 1,400]]

Large assortments offer consumers many benefits, notably increased choice and the possibility that the consumer will be able to locate the ideal product. However, for the retailer, larger assortments incur costs in terms of record-keeping, managing inventory, pricing and risks associated with wastage due to spoiled, shopworn or unsold stock. Carrying more stock also exposes the retailer to higher risks in terms of slow-moving stock and lower sales per square foot of store space. On the other hand, reducing the number of product lines can generate cost savings through increased stock turnover by eliminating slow-moving lines, fewer stockouts, increased bargaining power with suppliers, reduced costs associated with wastage and carrying inventory, and higher sales per square foot which means more efficient space utilisation.

When determining the number of product lines to carry, the retailer must consider the store type, store's physical storage capacity, the perishability of items, expected turnover rates for each line and the customer's needs and expectations.

====Customer service and supporting services====
[[File:20111012-FNCS-LSC-0488 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|left|Self-service is a more cost efficient way to deliver goods]]

[[Customer service]] is the "sum of acts and elements that allow consumers to receive what they need or desire from [the] retail establishment." Retailers must decide whether to provide a full service outlet or minimal service outlet, such as no-service in the case of vending machines; self-service with only basic sales assistance or a full service operation as in many boutiques and speciality stores. In addition, the retailer needs to make decisions about sales support such as customer delivery and after sales customer care.

Retailing services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, exchange/ return services, product demonstration, special orders, customer loyalty programs, limited-scale trial, advisory services and a range of other supporting services. Retail stores often seek to differentiate along customer service lines. For example, some department stores offer the services of a ''stylist''; a fashion advisor, to assist customers selecting a fashionable wardrobe for the forthcoming season, while smaller boutiques may allow regular customers to take goods home ''on approval'', enabling the customer to try out goods before making the final purchase. The variety of supporting services offered is known as the ''service type.'' At one end of the spectrum, self-service operators offer few basic support services. At the other end of the spectrum, full-service operators offer a broad range of highly personalised customer services to augment the retail experience.&lt;ref&gt;Lambda, A.J., ''The Art Of Retailing'', McGraw-Hill, New Dehli, 2008, pp. 351–411&lt;/ref&gt;

When making decisions about customer service, the retailer must balance the customer's desire for full-service against the customer's willingness to pay for the cost of delivering supporting services. Self-service is a very cost efficient way of delivering services since the retailer harnesses the customers labour power to carry out many of the retail tasks. However, many customers appreciate full service and are willing to pay a premium for the benefits of full-service.&lt;ref&gt;Lambda, A.J., ''The Art Of Retailing'', McGraw-Hill, (2003), 2008, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

A sales assistant's role typically includes greeting customers, providing product and service-related information, providing advice about products available from current stock, answering customer questions, finalising customer transactions and if necessary, providing follow-up service necessary to ensure customer satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Philip H. Mitchell 2008, ''Discovery-Based Retail'', Bascom Hill Publishing Group {{ISBN|978-0-9798467-9-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For retail store owners, it is extremely important to train personnel with the requisite skills necessary to deliver excellent customer service. Such skills may include product knowledge, inventory management, handling cash and credit transactions, handling product exchange and returns, dealing with difficult customers and of course, a detailed knowledge of store policies. The provision of excellent customer service creates more opportunities to build enduring customer relationships with the potential to turn customers into sources of referral or retail advocates. In the long term, excellent customer service provides businesses with an ongoing [[reputation]] and may lead to a competitive advantage. Customer service is essential for several reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Customer Service: Why it is important {{!}} business.gov.au|url = http://www.business.gov.au/business-topics/selling-products-and-services/customers/Pages/customer-service.aspx|website = www.business.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, customer service contributes to the customer's overall retail experience. Secondly, evidence suggests that a retail organization which trains its employees in appropriate customer service benefits more than those who do not. [[Customer service training]] entails instructing personnel in the methods of servicing the customer that will benefit corporations and businesses. It is important to establish a bond amongst customers-employees known as [[Customer relationship management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.gov.au/business-topics/selling-products-and-services/customers/Pages/customer-service.aspx|title=What is good customer service?|first=c=AU;o=Australian Government;ou=Department of Industry, Innovation and|last=Science|date=15 November 2017|website=www.business.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Types of customer service=====
There are several ways the retailer can deliver services to consumers:
* [[Counter service]], where goods are out of reach of buyers and must be obtained from the seller. This type of retail is common for small expensive items (e.g. jewellery) and controlled items like medicine and liquor.
* Click and Commute, where products are ordered online and are picked up via a drive through.
* Ship to Store, where products are ordered online and can be picked up at the retailer's main store
* [[Delivery (commerce)|Delivery]], where goods are shipped directly to consumer's homes or workplaces.
* [[Mail order]] from a printed catalogue was invented in 1744 and was common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Ordering by [[telephone]] was common in the 20th century, either from a catalog, newspaper, [[television advertisement]] or a local restaurant [[menu]], for immediate service (especially for [[pizza delivery]]), remaining in common use for food orders. Internet shopping&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;– a form of delivery&amp;nbsp;– has eclipsed phone-ordering, and, in several sectors&amp;nbsp;– such as books and music&amp;nbsp;– all other forms of buying. There is increasing competitor pressure to deliver consumer goods&amp;nbsp;– especially those offered online&amp;nbsp;– in a more timely fashion. Large online retailers such as [[Amazon.com]] are continually innovating and as of 2015 offer one-hour delivery in certain areas. They are also working with drone technology to provide consumers with more efficient delivery options. [[Direct marketing]], including [[telemarketing]] and television [[shopping channel]]s, are also used to generate telephone orders. started gaining significant market share in developed countries in the 2000s.
* [[Door-to-door]] sales, where the salesperson sometimes travels with the goods for sale.
* [[Self service|Self-service]], where goods may be handled and examined prior to purchase.
* [[Digital distribution|Digital delivery]] or [[Download]], where intangible goods, such as music, film, and electronic books and subscriptions to magazines, are delivered directly to the consumer in the form of information transmitted either over wires or air-waves, and is reconstituted by a device which the consumer controls (such as an [[MP3 player]]; see ''[[digital rights management]]''). The digital sale of models for [[3D printing]] also fits here, as do the media leasing types of services, such as [[streaming media|streaming]].

=== Place ===
Place decisions are primarily concerned with consumer access and may involve location, space utilisation and operating hours.

[[File:Souvenir.london.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|Sellers of souvenirs are typically located in high traffic areas such as this London souvenir stand situated near a railway station on a busy street corner]]

====Location====
Also see [[Site selection]]

Retail stores are typically located where market opportunities are optimal&amp;nbsp;– high traffic areas, central business districts. Selecting the right site can be a major success factor. When evaluating potential sites, retailers often carry out a ''trade area analysis''; a detailed analysis designed to approximate the potential patronage area. Techniques used in trade area analysis include: [[Radial set|Radial (ring) studies]]; [[Gravity model of trade|Gravity models]] and Drive time analyses.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, D., "Retail Trade Area Analysis: Concepts and New Approaches", ''Directions Magazine'', n.d. &lt;Online: http://www.directionsmag.com/entry/retail-trade-area-analysis-concepts-and-new-approaches/129766&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, retailers may consider a range of both qualitative and quantitative factors to evaluate to potential sites under consideration:

===== Macro factors =====
:: Macro factors include market characteristics (demographic, economic and socio-cultural), demand, competition and infrastructure (e.g. the availability of power, roads, public transport systems)

===== Micro factors =====
:: Micro factors include the size of the site (e.g. availability of parking), access for delivery vehicles

====Channels====

A major retail trend has been the shift to multi-channel retailing. To counter the disruption caused by online retail, many bricks and mortar retailers have entered the online retail space, by setting up online catalogue sales and e-commerce websites. However, many retailers have noticed that consumers behave differently when shopping online. For instance, in terms of choice of online platform, shoppers tend to choose the online site of their preferred retailer initially, but as they gain more experience in online shopping, they become less loyal and more likely to switch to other retail sites.&lt;ref&gt;Verhoef, P., Kannan, P.K. and Inman, J., "From Multi-channel Retailing to Omni-channel Retailing: Introduction to the Special Issue on Multi-channel Retailing", ''Journal of Retailing'', vol. 91,  mpp 174-181. DOI: 10.1016/j.jretai.2015.02.005&lt;/ref&gt; Online stores are usually available 24 hours a day, and many consumers in Western countries have Internet access both at work and at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-02-06|title=Online shopping|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Online_shopping&amp;oldid=824282185|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pricing strategy and tactics===
See also [[Pricing Strategies]]

[[File:Sale Tags.jpg|thumb|A price tag is a highly visual and objective guide to value]]

The broad pricing strategy is normally established in the company's overall strategic plan. In the case of chain stores, the pricing strategy would be set by head office. Broadly, there are six approaches to pricing strategy mentioned in the marketing literature:

: '''Operations-oriented pricing''': where the objective is to optimise productive capacity, to achieve operational efficiencies or to match supply and demand through varying prices. In some cases, prices might be set to [[demarketing|demarket]].&lt;ref name="Dibb, S. 2013"&gt;Dibb, S., Simkin, L., Pride, W.C. and Ferrell, O.C., ''Marketing: Concepts and Strategies'', Cengage, 2013, Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''Revenue-oriented pricing:''' (also known as ''profit-oriented pricing'' or ''cost-based pricing'')&amp;nbsp;– where the marketer seeks to maximise the profits (i.e., the surplus income over costs) or simply to cover costs and [[Break-even (economics)|break even]].&lt;ref name="Dibb, S. 2013"/&gt;

: '''Customer-oriented pricing''': where the objective is to maximise the number of customers; encourage cross-selling opportunities or to recognise different levels in the customer's ability to pay.&lt;ref name="Dibb, S. 2013"/&gt;

: '''[[Value-based pricing]]''': (also known as ''image-based pricing'') occurs where the company uses prices to signal market value or associates price with the desired value position in the mind of the buyer. The aim of value-based pricing is to reinforce the overall positioning strategy e.g. premium pricing posture to pursue or maintain a luxury image.&lt;ref&gt;Nagle, T., Hogan, J. and Zale, J., ''The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Growing More Profitably'', Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 1 and 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, R., Canning, L. and McDowell, R., ''Business-to-Business Marketing'', 2nd ed., London, Sage, 2011, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

: [[Relationship-based pricing|'''Relationship-oriented pricing''']]: where the marketer sets prices in order to build or maintain relationships with existing or potential customers.&lt;ref&gt;Neumeier, M.,
''The Brand Flip: Why customers now run companies and how to profit from it (Voices That Matter)'', 2008, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

:  '''Socially-oriented pricing''': Where the objective is to encourage or discourage specific social attitudes and behaviours. e.g. high tariffs on tobacco to discourage smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin, G., ''Modern Cost-Benefit Methods'', Macmillan, 1978, pp. 137–60&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pricing tactics====
{{see also|Pricing}}
[[File:Bonownik kelnerski czytnik kodów kreskowych drukarka fiskalna HORECA13.jpg|thumb|left|Retailers must also plan for mode of payment]]

When decision-makers have determined the broad approach to pricing (i.e., the pricing strategy), they turn their attention to pricing tactics. Tactical pricing decisions are shorter term prices, designed to accomplish specific short-term goals. The tactical approach to pricing may vary from time to time, depending on a range of internal considerations (e.g. the need to clear surplus inventory) or external factors (e.g. a response to competitive pricing tactics). Accordingly, a number of different pricing tactics may be employed in the course of a single planning period or across a single year. Typically store managers have the necessary latitude to vary prices on individual lines provided that they operate within the parameters of the overall strategic approach.

Retailers must also plan for customer preferred payment modes&amp;nbsp;– e.g. cash, credit, lay-by, Electronic Funds Transfer at Point-of-Sale (EFTPOS). All payment options require some type of handling and attract costs. If credit is to be offered, then credit terms will need to be determined. If lay-by is offered, then the retailer will need to take into account the storage and handling requirements. If cash is the dominant mode of payment, the retailer will need to consider small change requirements, the number of cash floats required, wages costs associated with handling large volumes of cash and the provision of secure storage for change floats. Large retailers, handling significant volumes of cash, may need to hire security service firms to carry the day's takings and deliver supplies of small change. A small, but increasing number of retailers are beginning to accept newer modes of payment including PayPal and Bitcoin.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, A., "PayPal Deepens Retail Drive in Discover Payments Deal", ''Technology News.'' 22 August 2012, &lt;Online: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Retail&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16#&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Subway (US) recently announced that it would accept Bitcoin payments.&lt;ref&gt;CNBC, "Somebody tell Jared: This Subway Takes Bitcoins", 18 November 2013, https://www.cnbc.com/2013/11/18/somebody-tell-jared-this-subway-takes-bitcoins.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sales promotion 2015 0003.JPG|thumb|A discount is any form of reduction in price]]
Pricing tactics that are commonly used in retail include:

;Discount pricing
Discount pricing is where the marketer or retailer offers a reduced price. Discounts in a variety of forms&amp;nbsp;– e.g. quantity discounts, loyalty rebates, seasonal discounts, periodic or random discounts etc.&lt;ref name="Rao, V.R 2009, p.15"&gt;Rao, V.R. and Kartono, B., "Pricing Strategies and Objectives: A Cross-cultural Survey", in ''Handbook of Pricing Research in Marketing'', Rao, V.R. (ed), Northampton, MA, Edward Elgar, 2009, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EDLP 2.JPG|thumb|left|Everyday Low Prices" are widely used in supermarkets]]
;Everyday low prices (EDLP)
[[Everyday low price]]s refers to the practice of maintaining a regular low price-low price&amp;nbsp;– in which consumers are not forced to wait for discounting or specials. This method is extensively used by supermarkets.&lt;ref&gt;Hoch, S.J., Dreze, X. and Purk, M., "EDLP, Hi-Lo, and Margin Arithmetic", ''The Journal of Marketing'', Volume 58, Number 4, 1994, pp. 16–27&lt;/ref&gt;

;High-low pricing
High-low pricing refers to the practice of offering goods at a high price for a period of time, followed by offering the same goods at a low price for a predetermined time. This practice is widely used by chain stores selling homewares. The main disadvantage of the high-low tactic is that consumers tend to become aware of the price cycles and time their purchases to coincide with a low-price cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Hoch, S.J., Dreze, X. and Purk, M. E., "EDLP, Hi-Lo, and Margin Arithmetic", ''The Journal of Marketing'', Volume 58, Number 4, 1994, pp. 16–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, P., "Deception in retailer high-low pricing: A 'rule of reason' approach", ''Journal of Retailing, '' Volume 70, Issue 2, 1994, pp. 115–1383.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Loss leader
A [[loss leader]] is a product that has a price set below the [[operating margin]]. Loss leadering is widely used in supermarkets and budget-priced retail outlets where it is intended to generate store traffic. The low price is widely promoted and the store is prepared to take a small loss on an individual item, with an expectation that it will recoup that loss when customers purchase other higher priced-higher margin items. In service industries, loss leadering may refer to the practice of charging a reduced price on the first order as an inducement and with anticipation of charging higher prices on subsequent orders.

;Price bundling
[[File:Xbox 360 FF XIII Special Ed. bundle price tag at Target, Tanforan.JPG|thumb|Xbox price bundle price]]
Price bundling (also known as [[product bundling]]) occurs where two or more products or services are priced as a package with a single price. There are several types of bundles: ''pure bundles'' where the goods can only be purchased as package or ''mixed bundles'' where the goods can be purchased individually or as a package. The prices of the bundle is typically less than when the two items are purchased separately.&lt;ref&gt;Guiltnan, J.P., "The Price Bundling of Services", ''Journal of Marketing'', April 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Price bundling is extensively used in the personal care sector to prices cosmetics and skincare.

;Price lining
''Price lining'' is the use of a limited number of prices for all product offered by a business. Price lining is a tradition started in the old [[five and dime]] stores in which everything cost either 5 or 10 cents. In price lining, the price remains constant but quality or extent of product or service adjusted to reflect changes in cost. The underlying rationale of this tactic is that these amounts are seen as suitable [[price points]] for a whole range of products by prospective customers. It has the advantage of ease of administering, but the disadvantage of inflexibility, particularly in times of [[inflation]] or unstable prices. Price lining continues to be widely used in department stores where customers often note racks of garments or accessories priced at predetermined price points e.g. separate racks of men's ties, where each rack is priced at $10, $20 and $40.

;Promotional pricing
Promotional pricing is a temporary measure that involves setting prices at levels lower than normally charged for a good or service. Promotional pricing is sometimes a reaction to unforeseen circumstances, as when a downturn in demand leaves a company with excess stocks; or when competitive activity is making inroads into market share or profits.&lt;ref&gt;Livesay, F., ''Promotional Pricing'', Macmillan, 1976, pp. 77–82&lt;/ref&gt;

;Psychological pricing
[[File:Fan-Tankstelle von Dynamo Dresden.JPG|thumb|left|Extensive use of the terminal digit 'nine' suggests that psychological pricing is at play]]

[[Psychological pricing]] is a range of tactics designed to have a positive psychological impact. Price tags using the terminal digit "9", ($9.99, $19.99 or $199.99) can be used to signal [[price point]]s and bring an item in at just under the consumer's [[reservation price]]. Psychological pricing is widely used in a variety of retail settings.&lt;ref&gt;Poundstone, W., ''Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value (and How to Take Advantage of It)'', New York: Hill and Wang, 2011, pp. 184–200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personnel and staffing===
Because patronage at a retail outlet varies, flexibility in [[Schedule (workplace)|scheduling]] is desirable. [[Employee scheduling software]] is sold, which, using known patterns of customer patronage, more or less reliably predicts the need for staffing for various functions at times of the year, day of the month or week, and time of day. Usually needs vary widely. Conforming staff utilization to staffing needs requires a flexible workforce which is available when needed but does not have to be paid when they are not, [[part-time]] [[Workforce|workers]]; as of 2012 70% of retail workers in the United States were part-time. This may result in financial problems for the workers, who while they are required to be available at all times if their work hours are to be maximized, may not have sufficient income to meet their family and other obligations.&lt;ref name=NYT102812&gt;{{cite news|title=A Part-Time Life, as Hours Shrink and Shift|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/business/a-part-time-life-as-hours-shrink-and-shift-for-american-workers.html|accessdate=28 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 October 2012|author=Steven Greenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Selling and sales techniques====
Also see [[Personal selling]]

[[File:(1)Burwood McDonalds.jpg|thumb|One of the most well-known cross-selling sales scripts comes from McDonald's. "Would you like fries with that?"]]
Retailers can employ different techniques to enhance sales volume and to improve the customer experience:

; Add-on, Upsell or Cross-sell.
: Upselling and cross selling are sometimes known as ''suggestive selling.'' When the consumer has selected their main purchase, sales assistants can try to sell the customer on a premium brand or higher quality item (up-selling) or can suggest complementary purchases (cross-selling). For instance, if a customer purchases a non-stick frypan, the sales assistant might suggest plastic slicers that do not damage the non-stick surface.
; Selling on value
: Skilled sales assistants find ways to focus on value rather than price. Selling on value often involves identifying a product’s unique features. Adding value to goods or services such as a free gift or buy 1 get 1 free adds value to customers where as the store is gaining sales&lt;ref&gt;Hee, J. K., "Stand-alone Sale of a Free Gift: Is it effective to accentuate promotion value?" ''Social Behavior &amp; Personality: An International Journal'', Vol. 43, no. 10, 2015, pp 1593-1606&lt;/ref&gt;
; Know when to close the sale
: Sales staff must learn to recognise when the customer is ready to make a purchase. If the sales person feels that the customer is ready, then they may seek to gain commitment and close the sale. Experienced sales staff soon learn to recognise specific verbal and non-verbal cues that signal the client's readiness to buy. For instance, if a customer begins to handle the merchandise, this may indicate a state of buyer interest. Clients also tend to employ different types of questions throughout the sales process. General questions such as, "Does it come in any other colours (or styles)?" indicate only a moderate level of interest. However, when clients begin to ask specific questions, such as "Do you have this model in black?" then this often indicates that the prospect is approaching readiness to buy.&lt;ref&gt;Cant, M.C. and van Heerden, C.H., ''Personal Selling'', Juta Academic, 2008, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; When the sales person believes that the prospective buyer is ready to make the purchase, a ''trial close'' might be used to test the waters. A trial close is simply any attempt to confirm the buyer's interest in finalising the sale. An example of a trial close, is "Would you be requiring our team to install the unit for you?" or "Would you be available to take delivery next Thursday?" If the sales person is unsure about the prospect's readiness to buy, they might consider using a 'trial close.' The salesperson can use several different techniques to close the sale; including the ‘alternative close’, the ‘assumptive close’, the ‘summary close’, or the ‘special-offer close’, among others.

===Promotion===
One of the unique aspects of retail promotions is that two brands are often involved; the store brand and the brands that make up the retailer's product range. Retail promotions that focus on the store tend to be ‘image’ oriented, raising awareness of the store and creating a positive attitude towards the store and its services. Retail promotions that focus on the product range, are designed to cultivate a positive attitude to the brands stocked by the store, in order to indirectly encourage favourable attitudes towards the store itself.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L., ''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications'', Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Some retail advertising and promotion is partially or wholly funded by brands and this is known as co-operative (or co-op) advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L., ''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications'', Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Retailers make extensive use of advertising via newspapers, television and radio to encourage store preference. In order to up-sell or cross-sell, retailers also use a variety of in-store sales promotional techniques such as product demonstrations, samples, point-of-purchase displays, free trial, events, promotional packaging and promotional pricing. In grocery retail, shelf wobblers, trolley advertisements, taste tests and recipe cards are also used. Many retailers also use loyalty programs to encourage repeat patronage.

===Presentation===
See [[Merchandising]]; [[Servicescape]]s; [[Retail design]]
[[File:Truefitt &amp; Hill products.jpg|thumb|The way that products are displayed is part of the store's presentation]]

Presentation refers to the physical evidence that signals the retail image. Physical evidence may include a diverse range of elements&amp;nbsp;– the store itself including premises, offices, exterior facade and interior layout, websites, delivery vans, warehouses, staff uniforms.

==== Designing retail spaces ====
[[File:Servicescapes.pdf|thumb|left|Simplified servicescapes model]]

The environment in which the retail service encounter occurs is sometimes known as the ''retail servicescape.''&lt;ref&gt;"The Impact of Retail Servicescape on Buying Behaviour", ''BVIMSR's Journal of Management Research'',  Vol 6, No. 2, 2014, pp. 10–17&lt;/ref&gt; The store environment consists of many elements such as smells, the physical environment (furnishings, layout and functionality), ambient conditions (lighting, temperature, noise) as well as signs, symbols and artifacts (e.g. sales promotions, shelf space, sample stations, visual communications). Collectively, these elements contribute to the ''perceived retail servicescape'' or the overall ''atmosphere'' and can influence both the customer's cognitions, emotions and their behaviour within the retail space.

Retail designers pay close attention to the front of the store, which is known as the ''decompression zone''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, B., &amp; Francis, D. (2002). Store design that sells. Hardware Merchandising, 42–46.&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually an open space in the entrance of the store to allow customers to adjust to their new environment. An open-plan floor design is effective in retail as it allows customers to see everything. In terms of the store's exterior, the side of the road cars normally travel, determines the way stores direct customers. New Zealand retail stores, for instance, would direct customers to the left.

In order to maximise the number of selling opportunities, retailers generally want customers to spend more time in a retail store. However, this must be balanced against customer expectations surrounding convenience, access and realistic waiting times. The overall aim of designing a retail environment is to have customers enter the store, and explore the totality of the physical environment engaging in a variety of retail experiences&amp;nbsp;– from browsing through to sampling and ultimately to purchasing. The retail service environment plays an important role in affecting the customer's perceptions of the retail experience.&lt;ref&gt;Wakefield, L. K. and Blodgett, G. J., "The Effect of the Servicescape on Customers’ Behavioral Intentions in Leisure Service Settings", ''The Journal of Services Marketing'', Vol. 10, No. 6, pp. 45–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harrods Food Department Halls (8473364801).jpg|thumb|The retail servicescape includes the appearance, equipment, display space, retail counters, signage, layout and functionality of a retail outlet. Pictured:[[Harrods]] food court]]

The retail environment not only affects quality perceptions, but can also impact on the way that customers navigate their way through the retail space during the retail service encounter. Layout, directional signage, the placement of furniture, shelves and display space along with the store's ambient conditions all affect patron's passage through the retail service system. Layout refers to how equipment, shelves and other furnishings are placed and the relationship between them. In a retail setting, accessibility is an important aspect of layout. For example, the grid layout used by supermarkets with long aisles and gondolas at the end displaying premium merchandise or promotional items, minimises the time customers spend in the environment and makes productive use of available space.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, C.M. and Mitchell, R., ''Wine Marketing: A Practical Guide'', p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; The gondola, so favoured by supermarkets, is an example of a retail design feature known as a ''merchandise outpost'' and which refers to special displays, typically at or near the end of an aisle, whose purpose is to stimulate [[impulse purchase|impulse purchasing]] or to complement other products in the vicinity. For example, the meat cabinet at the supermarket might use a merchandise outpost to suggest a range of marinades or spice rubs to complement particular cuts of meat. As a generalisation, merchandise outposts are updated regularly so that they maintain a sense of novelty.&lt;ref&gt;"Interior Design Tips: 6 Steps to Design Your Retail Shop", ''Retail Shop Design'', &lt;Online: https://retailshopdesign.com.sg/interior-design-tips-retail-design-layout&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ziethaml et al., layout affects how easy or difficult it is to navigate through a system. Signs and symbols provide cues for directional navigation and also inform about appropriate behaviour within a store. Functionality refers to extent to which the equipment and layout meet the goals of the customer.&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V. A., Bitner, M. J. and Gremler, D. D., ''Services Marketing: Integrating Customer Focus Across the Firm'', 5th ed., Boston, MA, McGraw Hill, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the case of supermarkets, the customer's goal may be to minimise the amount of time spent finding items and waiting at the check-out, while a customer in a retail mall may wish to spend more time exploring the range of stores and merchandise. With respect to functionality of layout, retail designers consider three key issues; circulation&amp;nbsp;– design for traffic-flow and that encourages customers to traverse the entire store; coordination&amp;nbsp;– design that combines goods and spaces in order to suggest customer needs and convenience&amp;nbsp;– design that arranges items to create a degree of comfort and access for both customers and employees.&lt;ref&gt;Aghazadeh,  S., "Layout Strategies for Retail Operations:  A Case Study", ''Management Research News'', Vol. 28, no. 10, 2005, pp. 31–46&lt;/ref&gt;

The way that brands are displayed is also part of the overall retail design. Where a product is placed on the shelves has implications for purchase likelihood as a result of visibility and access. Products placed too high or too low on the shelves may not turn over as quickly as those placed at eye level.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, C.M. and Mitchell, R., ''Wine Marketing: A Practical Guide'', pp. 182–83&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to access, store designers are increasingly giving consideration to access for disabled and elderly customers.

Through sensory stimulation retailers can engage maximum emotional impact between a brand and its consumers by relating to both profiles; the goal and experience. Purchasing behaviour can be influenced through the physical evidence detected by the senses of touch, smell, sight, taste and sound.&lt;ref name="Bailey, P. 2015"/&gt; Supermarkets offer taste testers to heighten the sensory experience of brands. Coffee shops allow the aroma of coffee to waft into streets so that passers-by can appreciate the smell and perhaps be lured inside. Clothing garments are placed at arms' reach, allowing customers to feel the different textures of clothing.&lt;ref name="Bailey, P. 2015"&gt;Bailey, P. (2015, April). Marketing to the senses: A multisensory strategy to align the brand touchpoints. Admap, 2-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Retailers understand that when customers interact with products or handle the merchandise, they are more likely to make a purchase.

Within the retail environment, different spaces may be designed for different purposes. Hard floors, such as wooden floors, used in public areas, contrast with carpeted fitting rooms, which are designed to create a sense of homeliness when trying on garments. [[Peter Alexander (fashion designer)|Peter Alexander]], retailer of sleep ware, is renowned for using scented candles in retail stores.

Ambient conditions, such as lighting, temperature and music, are also part of the overall retail environment.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, P. (2015, April). Marketing to the senses: A multi sensory strategy to align the brand touchpoints., 2-7.&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for a retail store to play music that relates to their target market. Studies have found that "positively valenced music will stimulate more thoughts and feeling than negatively valenced music", hence, positively valenced music will make the waiting time feel longer to the customer than negatively valenced music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hul|first=Michael K.|last2=Dube|first2=Laurette|last3=Chebat|first3=Jean-Charles|date=1997-03-01|title=The impact of music on consumers' reactions to waiting for services|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022435997900166|journal=Journal of Retailing|volume=73|issue=1|pages=87–104|doi=10.1016/S0022-4359(97)90016-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a retail store, for example, changing the background music to a quicker tempo may influence the consumer to move through the space at a quicker pace, thereby improving traffic flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bitner|first=M.J.|year=1992|title=Servicescapes: The impact of physical surroundings on customers and employees|jstor=1252042|journal=The Journal of Marketing|pages=57–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence also suggests that playing music reduces the negative effects of waiting since it serves as a distraction.&lt;ref&gt;Hul, M.K., Dube, L. and Chebat, J-C.,  " The impact of music on consumers' reactions to waiting for services",  ''Journal of Retailing'', Vol. 73, no. 1, 1997, pp. 87–104&lt;/ref&gt; Jewellery stores like [[Michael Hill Jeweller|Michael Hill]] have dim lighting with a view to fostering a sense of intimacy.

The design of a retail store is critical when appealing to the intended market, as this is where first impressions are made. The overall servicescape can influence a consumer's perception of the quality of the store, communicating value in visual and symbolic ways. Certain techniques are used to create a consumer brand experience, which in the long run drives store loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;(Kazançcoglu &amp; Dirsehan, 2014 )&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shopper profiles==
Two different strands of research have investigated shopper behaviour. One strand is primarily concerned with shopper motivations. Another stream of research seeks to segment shoppers according to common, shared characteristics. To some extent, these streams of research are inter-related, but each stream offers different types of insights into shopper behaviour.

[[File:Embroidery and lace- their manufacture and history from the remotest antiquity to the present day. A handbook for amateurs, collectors and general readers (1888) (14593807460).jpg|thumb|People who shop for pleasure are known as recreational shoppers. The recreational shopper has its origins in the grand European shopping arcades. Pictured: The gentry in a Dutch lace shop in the 17th century]]

Babin et al. carried out some of the earliest investigations into shopper motivations and identified two broad motives: ''utilitarian'' and ''hedonic.'' Utilitarian motivations are task-related and rational. For the shopper with utilitarian motives, purchasing is a work-related task that is to be accomplished in the most efficient and expedient manner. On the other hand, hedonic motives refer to pleasure. The shopper with hedonic motivations views shopping as a form of escapism where they are free to indulge fantasy and freedom. Hedonic shoppers are more involved in the shopping experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24098851 |doi=10.1086/209376|title=Work and/or Fun: Measuring Hedonic and Utilitarian Shopping Value|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=20|issue=4|pages=644|year=1994|last1=Babin|first1=Barry J.|last2=Darden|first2=William R.|last3=Griffin|first3=Mitch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many different shopper profiles can be identified. Retailers develop customised segmentation analyses for each unique outlet. However, it is possible to identify a number of broad shopper profiles. One of the most well-known and widely cited shopper typologies is that developed by Sproles and Kendal in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Durvasula, S., Lysonski, S. and Andrews, J.C. (1993), “Cross-cultural generalizability of a scale for profiling consumers’ decision-making styles”, ''The Journal of Consumer Affairs'', Vol. 27 No. 1, pp. 55–65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sproles, G.B. (1985), “From perfectionism to fadism: measuring consumers’ decision-making styles”, in Schnittgrund, K.P. (Ed.), ''American Council on Consumer Interests (ACCI), Conference Proceedings'', Columbia, MO, pp. 79–85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sproles, G. B. (1983). Conceptualisation and measurement of optimal consumer decision making. ''Journal of Consumer Affairs'', Vol. 17 No. 2, pp. 421–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Sproles and Kendall's consumer typology has been shown to be relatively consistent across time and across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1080/09593969.2014.911199|title=Consumer innovativeness and consumer decision styles: A confirmatory and segmentation analysis|journal=The International Review of Retail, Distribution and Consumer Research|volume=25|pages=35–54|year=2015|last1=Mishra|first1=Anubhav A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jain, R. and Sharma, A., "A Review on Sproles &amp; Kendall's Consumer Style Inventory (CSI) for Analyzing Decision Making Styles of Consumers", ''Indian Journal of Marketing'', Vol. 43, no. 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Their typology is based on the consumer's approach to making purchase decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Sproles, G. B., &amp; Kendall, E. L., "A methodology for profiling consumers' decision-marking styles", ''Journal of Consumer Affairs'', Vol., 20 No. 2, 1986, pp. 267–79&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Quality conscious/Perfectionist''': Quality-consciousness is characterised by a consumer's search for the very best quality in products; quality conscious consumers tend to shop systematically making more comparisons and shopping around.
* '''Brand-conscious''': Brand-consciousness is characterised by a tendency to buy expensive, well-known brands or designer labels. Those who score high on brand-consciousness tend to believe that the higher prices are an indicator of quality and exhibit a preference for department stores or top-tier retail outlets.
* '''Recreation-conscious/ Hedonistic''': Recreational shopping is characterised by the consumer's engagement in the purchase process. Those who score high on recreation-consciousness regard shopping itself as a form of enjoyment.
* '''Price-conscious''': A consumer who exhibits price-and-value consciousness. Price-conscious shoppers carefully shop around seeking lower prices, sales or discounts and are motivated by obtaining the best value for money
* '''Novelty/fashion-conscious''': characterised by a consumer's tendency to seek out new products or new experiences for the sake of excitement; who gain excitement from seeking new things; they like to keep up-to-date with fashions and trends, variety-seeking is associated with this dimension.
* '''Impulsive''': Impulsive consumers are somewhat careless in making purchase decisions, buy on the spur of the moment and are not overly concerned with expenditure levels or obtaining value. Those who score high on impulsive dimensions tend not to be engaged with the object at either a cognitive or emotional level.
* '''Confused (by over-choice)''': characterised by a consumer's confusion caused by too many product choices, too many stores or an overload of product information; tend to experience information overload.
* '''Habitual / brand loyal''': characterised by a consumer's tendency to follow a routine purchase pattern on each purchase occasion; consumers have favourite brands or stores and have formed habits in choosing; the purchase decision does not involve much evaluation or shopping around.

Some researchers have adapted Sproles and Kendall's methodology for use in specific countries or cultural groups.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, H. H., Sauer, N. E., and Becker, C., "Investigating the relationship between product involvement and consumer decision-making styles", ''Journal of Consumer Behaviour''. Vol. 5, 2006 342–354.&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer decision styles are important for retailers and marketers because they describe behaviours that are relatively stable over time and for this reason, they are useful for market segmentation.

==Retail format: types of retail outlet==

The ''retail format'' (also known as the ''retail formula'') influences the consumer's store choice and addresses the consumer's expectations. At its most basic level, a retail format is a simple [[marketplace]], that is; a location where goods and services are exchanged. In some parts of the world, the retail sector is still dominated by small family-run stores, but large [[retail chains]] are increasingly dominating the sector, because they can exert considerable buying power and pass on the savings in the form of lower prices. Many of these large retail chains also produce their own private labels which compete alongside manufacturer brands. Considerable consolidation of retail stores has changed the retail landscape, transferring power away from wholesalers and into the hands of the large retail chains.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinides, E., "The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing", ''Journal of Marketing Management'', Vol. 22, 2006, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain and Europe, the retail sale of goods is designated as a ''[[services marketing|service activity]].'' The European Service Directive applies to all retail trade including periodic markets, street traders and peddlers.

===Retail type by product===

Retail stores may be classified by the type of product carried:

; Food retailers
Retailers carrying highly perishable foodstuffs such as meat, dairy and fresh produce typically require cold storage facilities. Consumers purchase food products on a very regular purchase cycle&amp;nbsp;– e.g. daily, weekly or monthly.
; Softline retailers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.valueline.com/Tools/Educational_Articles/Stocks/The_World_of_Retail__Hardlines_vs__Softlines.aspx | title=The World of Retail: Hardlines vs. Softlines | publisher=Value Line | accessdate=22 May 2014 | author=Ferrara, J. Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/soft-merchandising-26175.html | title=What is Soft Merchandising? | publisher=Houston Chronicle | accessdate=22 May 2014 | author=Time, Forest}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Softline retailers sell goods that are consumed after a single use, or have a limited life (typically under three years) in they are normally consumed. Soft goods include [[clothing]], other [[fabrics]], [[footwear]], [[toiletries]], [[cosmetics]], [[medicines]] and [[stationery]].
; Grocery and convenience retail
Grocery stores, including supermarkets and hypermarkets, along with convenience stores carry a mix of food products and consumable household items such as detergents, cleansers, personal hygiene products. Consumer consumables are collectively known as fast-moving-consumer goods (FMCG) and represent the lines most often carried by supermarkets, grocers and convenience stores. For consumers, these are regular purchases and for the retailer, these products represent high turnover product lines. Grocery stores and convenience stores carry similar lines, but a convenience store is often open at times that suit its clientele and may be located for ease of access.
; Hardline retailers
Retailers selling consumer durables are sometimes known as ''hardline retailers''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.investorwords.com/2282/hard_goods.html | title=hard goods | publisher=Investor Words | accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – [[automobiles]], [[Home appliance|appliances]], [[electronics]], [[furniture]], [[sporting goods]], [[lumber]], etc., and parts for them. Goods that do not quickly wear out and provide utility over time. For the consumer, these items often represent major purchase decisions. Consumers purchase durables over longer purchase decision cycles. For instance, the typical consumer might replace their family car every 5 years, and their home computer every 4 years.
; Specialist retailers
Specialist retailers operate in many industries such as the arts e.g. green grocers, [[contemporary art galleries]], [[bookstores]], [[handicrafts]], [[musical instruments]], [[gift shops]].

===Retail types by marketing strategy===
Types of retail outlet by marketing strategy include:
;Arcade
A shopping arcade refers to a group of retail outlets operating under a covered walkway. Arcades are similar to shopping malls, although they typically comprise a smaller number of outlets. Shopping arcades were the evolutionary precursor to the shopping mall, and were very fashionable in the late 19th-century. Stylish men and women would promenade around the arcade, stopping to window shop, making purchases and also taking light refreshments in one of the arcade's tea-rooms. Arcades offered fashionable men and women opportunities to 'be seen' and to socialise in a relatively safe environment. Arcades continue to exist as a distinct type of retail outlet. Historic 19th-century arcades have become popular tourist attractions in cities around the world. [[Amusement arcade]]s, also known as penny arcades in the US, are more modern incarnation of the eighteenth and nineteenth century shopping arcade.
; [[Anchor store]]
An anchor store (also known as draw tenant or anchor tenant) is a larger store with a good reputation used by shopping mall management to attract a certain volume of shoppers to a precinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsc.org/srch/lib/SCDefinitions99.pdf "ICSC Shopping Center Definitions: Basic Configurations and Types for the United States"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621081346/http://www.icsc.org/srch/lib/SCDefinitions99.pdf |date=2007-06-21 }}, [[International Council of Shopping Centers]]. Accessed July 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Bazaar
The term, '[[bazaar]]' can have multiple meanings. It may refer to a Middle-Eastern market place while a 'penny bazaar' refers to a retail outlet that specialises in inexpensive or discounted merchandise. In the United States a bazaar can mean a "rummage sale" which describes a charity fundraising event held by a church or other community organization and in which either donated used goods are made available for sale. 
;Boutique
A [[Boutique]] is a small store offering a select range of fashionable goods or accessories. The term, 'boutique', in retail and services, appears to be taking on a broader meaning with popular references to retail goods and retail services such as boutique hotels, boutique beers (i.e. craft beers), boutique investments etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/boutique|title=Definition of BOUTIQUE|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pfficeworks inside.jpg|thumb|Australia's [[Officeworks]] is a category killer, retailing everything for the home office or small commercial office; stationery, furniture, electronics, communications devices, copying, printing and photography services, coffee, tea and light snacks]]
;Category killer
By supplying a wide assortment in a single category for lower prices a [[category killer]] retailer can "kill" that category for other retailers.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/category%20killer&lt;/ref&gt; A category killer is a specialist store that dominates a given category. Toys "R" Us, established in 1957, is thought to be the first category killer, dominating the children's toys and games market.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfeld, K.T., ''Time'', 19 October 1998&lt;/ref&gt; For a few categories, such as electronics, home hardware, office supplies and children's toys, the products are displayed at the centre of the store and a sales person will be available to address customer queries and give suggestions when required. Rival retail stores are forced to reduce their prices if a category killer enters the market in a given geographic area. Examples of category killers include [[Toys "R" Us]] and Australia's [[Bunnings Warehouse|Bunnings]] (hardware, DIY and outdoor supplies) and [[Officeworks]] (stationery and supplies for the home office and small office). Some category killers redefine the category. For example, Australia's Bunnings began as a hardware outlet, but now supplies a broad range of goods for the home handyman or small tradesman, including kitchen cabinetry, craft supplies, gardening needs and outdoor furniture. Similarly Officeworks straddles the boundary between stationery supplies, office furniture and digital communications devices in its quest to provide for all the needs of the retail consumer and the small, home office.
; Chain store
[[Chain store]] is one of a series of stores owned by the same company and selling the same or similar merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chain%20store&lt;/ref&gt; Chain stores aim to benefit from volume buying discounts (economies of scale) and achieve cost savings through economies of scope (e.g. centralised warehousing, marketing, promotion and administration) and pass on the cost savings in the form of lower prices.
[[File:Apple Store, Opéra 1.jpg|thumb|Apple's concept stores include video walls, wi-fi and desks to provide an immersive customer experience]]
; Concept store
Concept stores are similar to speciality stores in that they are very small in size, and only stock a limited range of brands or a single brand. They are typically operated by the brand that controls them. Example: [[L'Occitane en Provence|L'OCCITANE en Provence]]. The limited size and offering of L'OCCITANE's stores is too small to be considered a speciality store. However, a concept store goes beyond merely selling products, and instead offers an immersive customer experience built around the way that a brand fits with the customer's lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;"Rethinking why Brands are Embracing the Concept Store", ''The Guardian'', 9 July 2014 [https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/jul/09/retail-brands-concept-store-shopping Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include Apple's concept stores, [[Kit Kat]]'s concept store in Japan.
; Co-operative store
A [[Consumers' co-operative|co-operative store]]; also known as a co-op or coop, is a venture owned and operated by consumers to meet their social, economic and cultural needs.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge English Dictionary'' [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/cooperative-store Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;
; Convenience store
A [[convenience store]] provides limited amount of merchandise at above average prices with a speedy checkout. This store is ideal for emergency and immediate purchase [[consumables]] as it often operates with extended hours, stocking every day.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary.com'' [http://www.dictionary.com/browse/convenience-store Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Department store
[[Department store]]s are very large stores offering an extensive assortment of both "soft" and "hard" goods which often bear a resemblance to a collection of specialty stores. A retailer of such store carries a variety of categories and has a broad assortment of goods at moderate prices. They offer considerable customer service.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Dictionary'' [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/department-store.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;
; Destination store
A destination store is one that customers will initiate a trip specifically to visit, sometimes over a large area. These stores are often used to "[[anchor store|anchor]]" a shopping mall or plaza, generating foot traffic, which is capitalized upon by smaller retailers.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Dictionary'' [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/destination-store.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Demographic
Retailers that aim at one particular segment (e.g. high-end/ luxury retailers focusing on wealthy individuals or niche market).
;Discount store
[[Discount store]]s tend to offer a wide array of products and services, but they compete mainly on price. They offer extensive assortments of merchandise at prices lower than other retailers and are designed to be affordable for the market served. In the past, retailers sold less fashion-oriented brands. However, in more recent years companies such as [[TJX Companies]] (Own T.J. Maxx and Marshalls) and [[Ross Stores]] are discount store operations increasingly offering fashion-oriented brands on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Dictionary'' [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/discount-store.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;
;E-tailer
The customer can shop and order through the internet and the merchandise is dropped at the customer's doorstep or an [[e-tailer]]. In some cases, e-retailers use drop shipping technique. They accept the payment for the product but the customer receives the product directly from the manufacturer or a wholesaler. This format is ideal for customers who do not want to travel to retail stores and are interested in [[home shopping]].&lt;ref&gt;The Free Dictionary Online: http://www.thefreedictionary.com/e-tailer&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ScarsdaleGeneralStore.JPG|thumb|A general store in Scarsdale, Victoria, Australia operates as a post-office, newsagent, petrol station, video hire, grocer and take-away food retailer]]
; General merchandise retailer
A general merchandise retailer stocks a variety of products in considerable depth. The types of product offerings vary across this category. Department stores, convenience stores, hypermarkets and warehouse clubs are all examples of general merchandise retailers.&lt;ref&gt;Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C. Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S. Niininen, O. and Casidy, R., ''Marketing Principles'', 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018,  pp 450-451&lt;/ref&gt;
; General store
A [[general store]] is a store that supplies the main needs of the local community and is often located in outback or rural areas with low population densities. In areas of very low population density, a general store may be the only retail outlet within hundreds of miles. The general store carries a very broad product assortment; from foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals through to hardware and fuel. In addition, a general store may provide essential services such as postal services, banking services, news agency services and may also act as an agent for farm equipment and stock-food suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/general%20store&lt;/ref&gt;
; Give-away shop
As the name implies, a [[give-away shop]] provides goods for free. There are several different models of give-away shop in popular use. One is where goods are free to any shopper; an alternative is that shoppers must provide a product before they can take a product and a third variation is where consumers have the option of taking goods for free or paying any amount that they can afford. For example, Australia's restaurant group [[Lentil as Anything]] operates on a pay whatever you feel is right model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/business/small-business/lentil-as-anything-in-trouble-as-cheapskates-take-advantage-of-restaurants-charity/news-story/1973fd606b162b0ff091fae0e4af76cd|title=Cheapskate diners driving eatery to ruin|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Hawkers
[[Hawker (trade)|Hawkers]] also known as a [[peddler]]s, [[costermonger]]s or street vendors; refer to a vendor of merchandise that is readily portable. Hawkers typically operate in public places such as streets, squares, public parks or gardens or near the entrances of high traffic venues such as zoos, music and entertainment venues, but may also call on homes for door-to-door seling.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary Online: https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/hawker&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkers are a relatively common sight across Asia.
; [[High Street]] store
A high street store is a term used widely in the United Kingdom where more than 5,000 High Streets where a variety of stores congregate along a main road.&lt;ref&gt;BBC History Magazine Online, [https://www.historyextra.com/period/high-street/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Stores situated in the High Street provide for the needs of a local community, and often give a locality a unique identity.
;Hypermarkets
A [[hypermarket]] (also known as hypermart) provides variety and huge volumes of exclusive merchandise at low margins. The operating cost is comparatively less than other retail formats; may be defined as "a combined supermarket and discount store, at least {{Convert|200000|sqft|m2}} or larger, that sells a wide variety of food and general merchandise at a low price."&lt;ref&gt;''Collins Dictionary; [https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/hypermart Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Mall
A [[shopping mall|mall]] has a range of retail shops at a single building or outlet, arranged on a single level or multiple levels. A shopping mall typically includes one or more ''anchor'' stores.&lt;ref&gt;Zimring, C.A. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Consumption and Waste: The Social Science of Garbage'', Volume 1, Sage, 2012, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt; The retail mix in a mall may include outlets such as food and entertainment, grocery, electronics, furniture, gifts and fashion. Malls provide 7% of retail revenue in India, 10% in Vietnam, 25% in China, 28% in Indonesia, 39% in the Philippines, and 45% in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.indiaretailing.com/uploads/Market_Research_pdf/Retail-Realty-in-India-Evolution-and-Potential.pdf | title=Retail Realty in India: Evolution and Potential | publisher=Jones Lang LaSalle | year=2014 | pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malls are typically managed by a central management/ marketing authority which ensures that the mall attracts the right type of retailer and an appropriate retail mix.
;Mom-and-pop store
A small retail outlet owned and operated by an individual or family. Focuses on a relatively limited and selective set of products.
[[File:UNIQLO Pop-Up store at Union Square station (10333508835).jpg|thumb|UNIQLO Pop-Up store at Union Square station]]
;Pop-up retail store
A [[Pop-up retail]] store is a temporary retail space that opens for a short period of time, possibly opening to sell a specific run of merchandise or for a special occasion or holiday period. The key to the success of a pop-up is novelty in the merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, S., "Why Pop-Up Shops Are Hot", ''Time Magazine'', http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1935030,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;
; Retail marketplace
A [[Marketplace]] is defined as venue for the retail sales of all products, packed and unpacked where the sale is to end users.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Dictionary Online, http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/retail+market&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, retail markets are most often associated with the sale of fresh produce, including fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and poultry, but may also sell small consumable household goods such as cleaning agents. Globally, different terms may be used to refer to a retail market. For instance, in the Middle East, a market place may be known as a [[bazaar]] or [[souq|souq/souk]]
; [[Market square]] 
A market square is a [[city square]] where traders set up temporary stalls and buyers browse for purchases. In England, such markets operate on specific days of the week. This kind of market is very ancient, and countless such markets are still in operation around the world.

A speciality ([[American English|AE]]: specialty) store has a narrow marketing focus&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;– either specializing on specific merchandise, such as toys, footwear, or clothing, or on a target audience, such as children, tourists, or plus-size women.&lt;ref name=essential&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Kf_O1eI0J4C&amp;pg=PA363|page=363|title=Essentials of Marketing|author1=Charles Lamb |author2=Joe Hair |author3=Carl McDaniel |publisher=Cengage Learning|date= 14 Jan 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Size of store varies&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;– some speciality stores might be retail giants such as [[Toys "R" Us]], [[Foot Locker]], and [[The Body Shop]], while others might be small, individual shops such as [[Nutters of Savile Row]].&lt;ref name=essential/&gt; Such stores, regardless of size, tend to have a greater depth of the specialist stock than general stores, and generally offer specialist product knowledge valued by the consumer. Pricing is usually not the priority when consumers are deciding upon a speciality store; factors such as branding image, selection choice, and purchasing assistance are seen as important.&lt;ref name=essential/&gt; They differ from [[department store]]s and [[supermarket]]s which carry a wide range of merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=William M Pride |author2=Robert James Hughes |author3=Jack R. Kapoor | title = Business | publisher = Cengage Learning | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0538478083}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Supermarket
A [[supermarket]] is a self-service store consisting mainly of grocery and limited products on non-food items.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/supermarket&lt;/ref&gt; They may adopt a Hi-Lo or an [[Everyday low price|EDLP]] strategy for pricing. The supermarkets can be anywhere between {{Convert|20000|sqft|m2}} and {{convert|40,000|sqft|m2}}. Example: SPAR supermarket.
;Variety store
[[Variety store]]s offer extremely low-cost goods, with a vast array of selection. The downfall to this is that the items are not very high quality.&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'', [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/variety%20store Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Vending machine
[[File:Pivomat.jpg|thumb|Vending machines can be used to sell goods such as food and beverages as well as services such as tickets to events or public transport. Pictured a beer vending machine]]
A [[vending machine]] is an automated piece of equipment wherein customers can drop the money in the machine which dispenses the customer's selection. The vending machine is a pure self-service option. Machines may carry a phone number which customers can call in the event of a fault.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary Online, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/vending-machine.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some stores take a [[no frills]] approach, while others are "mid-range" or "high end", depending on what income level they target.
;Warehouse club
[[Warehouse club]]s are membership-based retailers that usually sell a wide variety of merchandise, in which customers may buy large, wholesale quantities of the store's products, which makes these clubs attractive to both bargain hunters and small business owners. The clubs are able to keep prices low due to the no-frills format of the stores. In addition, customers may be required to pay annual membership fees in order to shop.&lt;ref&gt;''Economic Times'' (Definitions), [http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/warehouse-clubs Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Warehouse store
[[Warehouse store]]s are retailers housed in warehouses, and offer low-cost, often high-quantity goods with minimal services, e.g. goods are piled on pallets or steel shelves. shopping aisles are narrow and cramped, added-value services such as home delivery are non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary'', [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/warehouse-store Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other retail types===
Other types of retail store include:
* [[Automated Retail|Automated retail]] stores&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;– self-service, robotic kiosks located in airports, malls and grocery stores. The stores accept credit cards and are usually open 24/7. Examples include [[ZoomShops]] and [[Redbox]].
* [[Big-box store]]s&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;– encompass larger department, discount, general merchandise, and warehouse stores.
* Second-hand retail
{{main|Second-hand shop}}
{{see also|Charity shop}}
: Some shops sell second-hand goods. In the case of a [[non-profit organization|nonprofit]] shop, the public donates goods to the shop to be sold. In [[give-away shop]]s goods can be taken free.
: [[Pawnbroker]]s Another form is the [[pawnbroker|pawnshop]], in which goods are sold that were used as collateral for loans. There are also "[[consignment]]" shops, which are where a person can place an item in a store and if it sells, the person gives the shop owner a percentage of the sale price. The advantage of selling an item this way is that the established shop gives the item exposure to more potential buyers. [[Online shopping|E-tailers]] like OLX and Quikr also offer second-hand goods.

Retailers can opt for a format as each provides different retail mix to its customers based on their customer demographics, lifestyle and purchase behaviour. An effective format will dtermine how products are display products, as well as how target customers are attracted.

==Challenges==
To achieve and maintain a foothold in an existing market, a prospective retail establishment must [[Barriers to entry|overcome the following hurdles]]:
* [[Regulations|Regulatory]] barriers including
** Restrictions on real estate purchases, especially as imposed by [[Municipality|local governments]] and against "big-box" [[Big box|chain retailers]];
** Restrictions on foreign investment in retailers, in terms of both absolute amount of financing provided and percentage share of voting stock (e.g. [[common stock]]) purchased;
* Unfavourable [[Tax code|taxation structures]], especially those designed to penalize or keep out "big box" retailers (see "Regulatory" above);
* Absence of developed supply chain and integrated IT management;
* High [[Competition (economics)|competitiveness]] among existing market participants and resulting low [[profit margin]]s, caused in part by
** Constant advances in product design resulting in constant threat of product obsolescence and price declines for existing [[inventory]]; and
* Lack of properly educated and/or trained work force, often including management, caused in part by loss in Business.
** Lack of [[Education in the United States|educational infrastructure]] enabling prospective market entrants to respond to the above challenges.

==Competition==
Retail stores may or may not have competitors close enough to affect their pricing, product availability, and other operations. A 2006 survey found that only 38% of retail stores in India believed they faced more than slight competition.&lt;ref name="retailcomp1-a"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/11/23/000333037_20081123235324/Rendered/PDF/465680WP0Box331C10Competition1Labor.pdf | title=Competition and Labor Productivity in India’s Retail Stores, p. 1 | publisher=World Bank | author=Mohammad Amin | year=2007 | pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competition also affected less than half of retail stores in Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, and Azerbaijan. In all countries the main competition was domestic, not foreign.&lt;ref name="retailcomp30-a"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/11/23/000333037_20081123235324/Rendered/PDF/465680WP0Box331C10Competition1Labor.pdf | title=Competition and Labor Productivity in India’s Retail Stores, p. 30 | publisher=World Bank | author=Mohammad Amin | year=2007 | pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mergers and acquisitions ===
Between 1985 and 2018 there have been 46,755 mergers or acquisitions conducted globally in the retail sector (either acquirer or target from the retail industry). These deals cumulate to an overall known value of around 2.561 bil. USD. The three major Retail M&amp;A waves took place in 2000, 2007 and lately in 2017. However the all-time high in terms of number of deals was in 2016 with more than 2,700 deals. In terms of added value 2007 set the record with 225 bil. USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-by-industries/|title=M&amp;A by Industries - Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|work=Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Retail Sales.png|thumb|U.S. Monthly Retail Sales, 1992–2010]]
Since 1951, the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] has published the Retail Sales report every month. It is a measure of [[consumer spending]], an important indicator of the US [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. Retail firms provide data on the dollar value of their retail sales and inventories. A [[Sampling (statistics)|sample]] of 12,000 firms is included in the final [[Statistical survey|survey]] and 5,000 in the advanced one. The advanced estimated data is based on a subsample from the US CB complete retail &amp; [[food service]]s sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/retail/index.html|title=US Census Bureau Monthly &amp; Annual Retail Trade|website=www.census.gov|date=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Europe===
In 2011, the grocery market in six countries of [[Central Europe]] was worth nearly €107bn, 2.8% more than the previous year when expressed in local currencies. The increase was generated foremost by the discount stores and supermarket segments, and was driven by the skyrocketing prices of foodstuffs. This information is based on the latest PMR report entitled Grocery retail in Central Europe 2012&lt;ref name="http://www.pmrpublications.com/product/Grocery-retail-Central-Europe-2012"&gt; Grocery retail in Central Europe 2012 [http://www.pmrpublications.com/product/Grocery-retail-Central-Europe-2012 Retail in Central Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World===
[[File:Zuerich Migroshochhaus 5.jpg|thumb|The two largest supermarkets chains in [[Switzerland]], [[Migros]] and [[Coop (Switzerland)|Coop]], are cooperatives.]]

National accounts show a combined total of retail and wholesale trade, with hotels and restaurants. in 2012 the sector provides over a fifth of GDP in tourist-oriented island economies, as well as in other major countries such as Brazil, Pakistan, Russia, and Spain. In all four of the latter countries, this fraction is an increase over 1970, but there are other countries where the sector has declined since 1970, sometimes in absolute terms, where other sectors have replaced its role in the economy. In the United States the sector has declined from 19% of GDP to 14%, though it has risen in absolute terms from $4,500 to $7,400 per capita per year. In China the sector has grown from 7.3% to 11.5%, and in India even more, from 8.4% to 18.7%. Emarketer predicts China will have the largest retail market in the world in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.techinasia.com/asia-ecommerce-spending-1-trillion-dollars-2016|title= Asia’s ecommerce spending to hit record $1 trillion this year – but most of that is China|first= Steven|last= Millward|date= 18 August 2016|accessdate= 18 August 2016|work= Tech in Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lumira was initially launched as SAP Visual Intelligence in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovativeretailtechnologies.com/doc/sap-releases-sap-s-visual-intelligence-to-keep-its-data-visualization-applications-0001|title=SAP Releases SAP's Visual Intelligence to Keep its Data Visualization Applications Up to Par with the Rise of In-Memory Databases|publisher=Innovative Retail Technologies|date=June 7, 2012|access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of the software could only use SAP's [[SAP HANA|HANA]] platform as a data source. The second release expanded data sources to include [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] and [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayforce.com/2012/07/visual-intelligence/ |title=SAP Visual Intelligence: Self-service Dashboards for Business Analysts|publisher=Bayforce|first=Clare |last=Plaisance |date=July 25, 2012 |access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, SAP rebranded the software under the Lumira name and began offering a version of the software as a [[cloud computing]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.informationweek.com/software/information-management/sap-steps-up-visual-analytics-mobile-bi/d/d-id/1110025?|title=SAP Steps Up Visual Analytics, Mobile BI|publisher=InformationWeek|first=Cindi |last=Howson|date=May 19, 2013|access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the cloud version of Lumira was absorbed into SAP's Cloud For Analytics software, while the Lumira Server and Lumira Desktop software remained separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/sap-teched-a-deeper-look-at-the-new-cloud-for-analytics-platform/|title=SAP TechEd: A Closer Look at the New 'Cloud for Analytics' Platform|publisher=ZDNet|first=Doug |last=Henschen|date=October 23, 2015|access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2992441/software-as-a-service/sap-unwraps-project-orca-and-gives-it-a-new-name.html|title=SAP Unwraps Project Orca and Gives it a New Name|publisher=Computerworld|first=Katherine |last=Noyes|date=October 13, 2015 |access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016, Lumira 2.x was announced.

'''Sonae''' is a multinational business group based in Maia, [[Portugal]]. It is present in 90 countries, operating in several sectors, including retail, financial services, shopping centres management, software and [[information system]]s, media and telecommunications.[https://www.sonae.pt/en/sonae/the-group-and-our-businesses/]

It is the largest private employer in Portugal, with 46,155 employees.[https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/profile?s=SON:LIS]

Sonae is listed on the [[Euronext]] PSI-20, in Lisbon, under the code SON.[https://www.euronext.com/pt-pt/products/equities/PTSON0AM0001-XLIS]

In the first semester of 2018, Sonae's turnover amounted to 2,680 million euros, with net results in the order of 98&amp;nbsp;million euros, more 34.2% than the same period last year.[https://www.sonae.pt/en/media/press-releases/sonae-strengthens-sales-and-profitability/] 

== History ==
Sonae was founded in 1959 by the entrepreneur, banker and patron from [[Arouca, Portugal|Arouca]], Afonso Pinto de Magalhães. The business group originated from the Sociedade Nacional de Estratificados, an industrial company operating in the area of processed wood, more specifically, in the production of decorative high-pressure laminated panels.[https://www.publico.pt/2015/03/15/economia/noticia/cronologia-acontecimentos-marcantes-da-historia-da-sonae-1689182] During the first two decades of existence, Sonae remained as a small to medium-size business company.

Afonso Pinto de Magalhães, also the founder of the Pinto Magalhães Bank, placed Fábio Lemos in control of Sonae in the turbulent years following the [[Carnation Revolution]]. During that period, the company was nationalized and then reprivatized.

In 1982, Afonso Pinto de Magalhães gave 16% of Sonae to [[Belmiro de Azevedo]], who had been admitted to Sonae in 1965. After the death of the founder, Belmiro de Azevedo reached the majority of the capital, with 54.6%, taking control of the company.[http://cdn.jornaldenegocios.pt/files/2015-03/09-03-2015_20_48_59_sonae-todos.PDF]

During the 1980s, Sonae began its fast growth. In 1985, Sonae Investimentos SGPS, S.A. was created and the group entered the [[Lisbon Stock Exchange]].[https://www.sonae.pt/pt/sonae/historia/] It was also in the early 1980s that Sonae began its business diversification strategy through acquisitions and the creation of new investments.

The group entered into the modern distribuition market by opening the first [[hypermarket]] in Portugal, "Continente", in [[Matosinhos]]. Two years later, Sonae launched seven takeover bids to seven companies, which allowed the business group to grow in various business areas.[https://www.publico.pt/2015/03/15/economia/noticia/cronologia-acontecimentos-marcantes-da-historia-da-sonae-1689182]

In 1993, Sonae Indústria expanded its investments by acquiring a controlling position in Spanish company [[Tafisa]], which allowed the company to extend its business segment. Posteriorly, another important step was taken when Sonae entered into the specialized retail area with the launch of Worten.

In 1998, with Paulo de Azevedo leading the project, Optimus was born.[http://www.nos.pt/institucional/PT/sobre-a-nos/quem-somos/Paginas/historia-optimus.aspx] The mobile operator merged with Zon in 2013, giving rise to NOS.

In 2007, Paulo de Azevedo took over the leadership of the Sonae group, succeeding his father, [[Belmiro de Azevedo]].[http://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/empresas/detalhe/paulo_azevedo_quotvamos_ser_grandes_e_internacionaisquot]

In March 2015, Belmiro de Azevedo announced his resignation as Sonae chairman. Paulo de Azevedo was chosen as the new chairman and CEO of the Sonae group, sharing the executive committee presidency with Ângelo Paupério, who was the vice president of Sonae until that point.[http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/economia/belmiro-de-azevedo-deixa-sonae-a-uma-lideranca-bicefala_v811094]

In 2018, Cláudia Azevedo was elected executive president of Sonae by the biggest shareholder company of the group, the Efanor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5746">'''Workfare''' is an alternative, and controversial, way of providing money to otherwise unemployed or underemployed people, who are applying for social benefits. The term was first introduced by [[civil rights]] leader [[James Charles Evers]] in 1968; however, it was popularized by [[Richard Nixon]] in a televised speech August 1969.&lt;ref name="peck"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peck|first=Jamie|title=Workfare: a geopolitical etymology.|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|year=1998|volume=16|pages=133–161|doi=10.1068/d160133}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early model of workfare had been pioneered in 1961 by [[Joseph Mitchell (city manager)|Joseph Mitchell]] in [[Newburgh, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leman|first=Christopher|title=The Collapse of Welfare Reform: Political Institutions, Policy, and the Poor in Canada and the United States|place=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=MIT Press|year=1980|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional welfare benefits systems are usually awarded based on certain conditions, such as searching for work, or based on meeting criteria that would position the recipient as unavailable to seek employment or be employed. Under workfare, recipients have to meet certain participation requirements to continue to receive their welfare benefits. These requirements are often a combination of activities that are intended to improve the recipient's job prospects (such as training, [[:wikt:rehabilitation|rehabilitation]], and [[work experience]]) and those designated as contributing to society (such as unpaid or low-paid work). These programs, now common in Australia (as "mutual obligation"), Canada, and the [[Workfare in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], have generated considerable debate and controversy. In the [[Netherlands]] workfare is known as Work First, based on the Wisconsin Works program from the United States.

There are two main types of workfare scheme: those that encourage direct employment to get individuals off the welfare roll and directly into the workforce, and those that are intended to increase human capital by providing training and education to those currently in the welfare system.&lt;ref name="peck" /&gt;

In less developed countries, similar schemes are designed to alleviate rural poverty among day-labourers by providing state-subsidised [[temporary work]] during those periods of the year when little agricultural work is available. For example, the [[National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA)]] in India offers 100 days' paid employment per year for those eligible, rather than unemployment benefits on the Western model. However, a workfare model typically not only focuses on provision of social protection through a wage-income transfer, but also supports workers to get into work.

== Goals ==
The purported main goal of workfare is to generate a "net contribution" to society from welfare recipients. Most commonly, it means getting unemployed people into paid work, reducing or eliminating welfare payments to them and creating an income that generates taxes. Workfare participants may retain certain employee rights throughout the process, however, often workfare programs are determined to be "outside employment relationships" and therefore the rights of beneficiaries can be different. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Dietrich| first1 = Sharon| last2 = Emsellem | first2 = M.| last3 = Paradise| first3 = J.| contribution = Employment Rights of Workfare Participants and Displaced Workers| title = National Employment Law Project Second Edition, March 2000| publisher = NELP| date =| year = 2000| contribution-url = http://www.nelp.org/docUploads/pub18%2Epdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some workfare systems also aim to derive a contribution from welfare recipients by more direct means. Such systems obligate unemployed people to undertake work that is considered beneficial to their community.

==Criticism==
[[File:Workfare.jpg|thumb|Demonstration against "workfare", October 2011.]]
Workfare schemes in the UK are controversial. In the US, critics point out that the type of work offered by workfare providers is generally unskilled and is comparable to community work carried out by criminal offenders being punished on [[community service]] schemes.&lt;ref name="Fuentes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fuentes|first1=Annette|title=Giuliani's Workfare: Slaves of New York|url=http://www.baltimorechronicle.com/workfare.html|journal="The Baltimore Chronicle"|accessdate=15 January 2018|date=6 Feb 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many charities and workers' unions have criticized workfare schemes for undermining the work done by actual charity volunteers, and acting as a threat to low paid unskilled workers.

In Australia, the [[Work for the Dole]] schemes have been linked to the concepts of “mutual obligation” and "compliance". Their effectiveness has been questioned by researchers.
