 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a derivative of the [[amino acid]] [[cysteine]]. When fresh garlic is chopped or crushed, the enzyme [[alliinase]] converts alliin into [[allicin]], which is responsible for the aroma of fresh garlic. 

Garlic has been used since antiquity as a therapeutic remedy for certain conditions now associated with [[oxygen toxicity]], and, when this was investigated, garlic did indeed show strong [[antioxidant]] and [[hydroxyl]] [[free radical|radical]]-scavenging properties, it is presumed owing to the alliin contained within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Alliin was the first natural product found to have both carbon- and sulfur-centered stereochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Garlic and other alliums: the lore and the science |author = Eric Block |publisher= [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |year= 2009 |pages= 100–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical synthesis ==
The first reported synthesis, by Stoll and Seebeck in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chemical investigations on alliin, the specific principle of garlic|last = Stoll , Seeback|first = Arthur, Ewald|date = 1951|journal = Advanced Enzymology |volume=11 |pages=377–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; begins the alkylation of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-cysteine with [[allyl bromide]] to form deoxyalliin. Oxidation of this sulfide with [[hydrogen peroxide]] gives both [[diastereomer]]s of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-alliin, differing in the orientation of the oxygen atom on the [[sulfur]] [[stereocenter]].
[[File:H2O2toAlliin.png|centre|frameless|420 px]]
A newer route, reported by Koch and Keusgen in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Diastereoselective synthesis of alliin by an asymmetric sulfur oxidation|last = Koch, Keusgen|date = 1998|journal = Pharmazie |volume=53 |issue=668-671}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows stereospecific oxidation using conditions similar to the [[Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation]]. The chiral catalyst is produced from [[diethyl tartrate]] and [[titanium isopropoxide]].

The '''Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory''' ('''AOML'''), a federal research laboratory, is part of [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s (NOAA) [[Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research]] (OAR), located in Miami, Florida. AOML's research spans [[tropical cyclone]] and hurricanes, [[coastal ecosystem]]s, oceans and human health, [[Climatology|climate studies]], global carbon systems, and ocean observations. It is one of seven NOAA Research Laboratories (RLs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NOAA Research Laboratories |publisher = NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research |date = |url = http://ci.noaa.gov/NOAAResearchLaboratories.aspx |accessdate = 2014-04-26 |archiveurl = |archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AOML’s organizational structure consists of an Office of the Director and three scientific research divisions. The Office of the Director oversees the Laboratory’s scientific programs, as well as its financial, administrative, computer, outreach/education, and facility management services. Research programs are augmented by the [[Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies]] (CIMAS), a joint enterprise with the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. CIMAS enables AOML and university scientists to collaborate on research areas of mutual interest and facilitates the participation of students and visiting scientists. 

The Laboratory is a member of a unique community of marine research and educational institutions located on [[Virginia Key]] in Miami, Florida. Approximately $150M per year is invested in marine science and education among the University of Miami's [[Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science]], NOAA's Southeast Fisheries Science Center, the [[Miami Seaquarium]], the [[Maritime and Science Technology Academy]] (MAST Academy).

==History==
The deeper roots of AOML can be traced to the oceanographic investigations of the U.S. Coast Survey beginning in the mid-19th century under the direction of Professor [[Alexander Dallas Bache]], great grandson of Benjamin Franklin and a preeminent U.S. science figure of the age. In subsequent decades, the urgency of charting coastal waters in support of growing commerce, a task increased by the acquisition of Alaska, Hawaii, and other island territories, came to require all the resources of the Coast Survey.
 
The modern era can be considered to have begun during the 1960s. In early 1966, an Institute for Oceanography was created, primarily from research groups of the then [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] of the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA, forerunner of NOAA). The following year the Institute was relocated to Miami for a variety of reasons, including the presence already in Miami of meteorological research groups of ESSA dedicated to hurricane research, and air-sea interaction was a hot topic of the time in weather research.
 
All of these groups were reorganized as the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratories (AOML) and by 1973 took occupancy in the new laboratory constructed on Virginia Key.
 
Emphasis at AOML continues to be on making and interpreting observations of the ocean and atmosphere from ships, buoys, and research aircraft. The motivation and objectives of our research is continually evolving, however. In the beginning, study of the geology, geophysics, and sedimentation of the sea floor was the largest activity of the Laboratory, but it has diminished to a smaller part of ecosystem research. Research in response to concerns for marine environmental quality and large-scale physics and chemistry of the oceans related to climate variation and global change have supplemented the original themes. Research into the nature and mechanisms of hurricanes has been and is also expected to continue as a major theme in view of the importance of this natural hazard to the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States.
 
New projects include expansion of the use of satellite and locally operated remote sensing techniques to enhance the coverage and detail of observations. Outreach via electronic communication is enabling AOML to  serve a larger constituency with access to oceanographic and meteorological observations.

==Research==
AOML conducts mission oriented scientific research that seeks to understand the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics and processes of the ocean and atmosphere, both separately and as a coupled system. The Laboratory’s research themes (oceans and climate, coastal ecosystems, and hurricanes and [[tropical meteorology]]) employ a cross-disciplinary approach, conducted through collaborative interactions with national and international research and environmental forecasting institutions. More information about AOML's research can be found at [http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/research/ http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/research].

===Oceans and its link to extreme weather and climate===
AOML carries out interdisciplinary scientific investigations of the physics of ocean currents and water properties, and on the role of the ocean in climate, extreme weather events, and ecosystems. The tools used to carry out these studies range from sensors on deep ocean moorings to satellite-based instruments to measurements made on research and commercial shipping vessels and autonomous vehicles, and include data analysis and numerical modeling as well as theoretical approaches  (http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod).
 
AOML manages, leads, or participate in the design, implementation, maintenance, and enhancement of several key components of the global ocean observing system and, with these and other data, conducts research in several areas including:
* [[Meridional Overturning Circulation]]
* Tropical Atlantic variability
* Oceans and extreme weather (hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, etc.)
* [[Physical oceanography]]
* Oceans and ecosystems
* Global carbon cycle
* Research to Applications and Operations
* Development of oceanographic instrumentation

===Coastal ecosystems===
Coastal and regional ecosystem research has been a focus of AOML activities for more than two decades. Current interdisciplinary field efforts include physical, biological, and chemical studies supporting the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration (SFER) effort and the underlying health of this ecosystem to the regional Intra-Americas Sea program, as well as the status and health of coral reef ecosystems worldwide.

Coastal Ecosystem related research projects:
* Global carbon cycle
* [[Climate change]]
* Coastal pollution
* Fishing effects
* Physical oceanography of [[coral reef]]s
* Coral health and monitoring program
* Petroleum and oil spill research
* Marine and Estuarine Goal Setting for South Florida (MARES) Project

===Hurricanes and tropical meteorology===
Tropical meteorology research at AOML is focused on advancing the understanding and prediction of hurricanes and other tropical weather. Scientists conduct their research utilizing a combination of models, theories, and observations, with particular emphasis on data obtained with research aircraft in the inner core of tropical cyclones and their surrounding environment.

Hurricanes and tropical meteorology related research projects:
* [[Tropical cyclone track forecasting|Track forecasting]]
* Hurricane intensity change
* [[Climate variation]]
* Hurricane impacts
* Administrative projects

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9903">{{About|static atmospheric models|weather prediction and climate models|atmospheric model}}

Static '''atmospheric models''' describe how the [[ideal gas]] properties (namely: pressure, temperature, density, and molecular weight) of an atmosphere change, primarily as a function of [[altitude]].  The [[World Meteorological Organization]] defines a standard atmosphere as "a hypothetical vertical distribution of atmospheric temperature, pressure and density which, by international agreement, is roughly representative of year-round, [[midlatitude]] conditions. Typical usages are as a basis for [[Altimeter#Pressure altimeter|pressure altimeter]] calibrations, aircraft performance calculations, aircraft and rocket design, [[External ballistics#Ambient air density|ballistic]] tables, and meteorological diagrams."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration| author-link = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | author2 = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | author2-link = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | author3 = United States Air Force | author3-link = United States Air Force | date = October 1976 | title = U. S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976 | publisher = U. S. Government Printing Office | publication-place = Washington, D.C. | page = xiv | url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19770009539.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[U.S. Standard Atmosphere]] derives the values for air temperature, pressure, and mass density, as a function of altitude above sea level.

Other static atmospheric models may have other outputs, or depend on inputs besides altitude.

==Basic assumptions==
The gas which comprises an atmosphere is usually assumed to be an [[ideal gas]], which is to say:

&lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{M P}{R T} &lt;/math&gt;

Where ''ρ'' is mass density, ''M'' is average molecular weight, ''P'' is pressure, ''T'' is temperature, and ''R'' is the ideal gas constant.

The gas is held in place by so-called "[[hydrostatic]]" forces.   That is to say, for a particular layer of gas at some altitude: the downward (towards the planet) force of its weight, the downward force exerted by pressure in the layer above it, and the upward force exerted by pressure in  the layer below, all sum to zero.  Mathematically this is:

:&lt;math&gt;P A - (P + \text{d}P) A - (\rho A \text{d}h) g_0 = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{d}P = - g_0 \rho \text{d}h \,&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, these variables describing the system do not change with time; i.e. it is a static system.

==Some examples==

Depending on the model, some gas properties may be treated as constant with respect to altitude.

===Ocean example===
If the density of a gas is persistent, then it isn't really behaving like a gas.  Instead it is behaving like an [[incompressible fluid]], or [[liquid]], and this situation looks more like an ocean.  Assuming density is constant, then a graph of pressure vs altitude will have a retained slope, since the weight of the ocean over head is directly proportional to its depth.

[[Image:Liquid ocean atmosphere model.png]]

===Isothermal-barotropic approximation and scale height===

This atmospheric model assumes both molecular weight and temperature are constant over a wide range of altitude. Such a model may be called [[isothermal]] (constant temperature). Inserting constant molecular weight and constant temperature into the equation for the [[ideal gas law]] produces the result that density and pressure, the two remaining variables, depend only on each other.  For this reason, this model may also be called [[barotropic]] (density depends only on pressure).

For the isothermal-barotropic model, density and pressure turn out to be exponential functions of altitude.  The increase in  altitude necessary for ''P'' or ''ρ'' to drop to 1/''e'' of its initial value is called the [[scale height]]:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{R T}{M g_0} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the ideal gas constant, ''T'' is temperature, ''M'' is average molecular weight, and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the gravitational acceleration at the planet's surface. Using the values ''T''=273 K and ''M''=29 g/mol as characteristic of the Earth's atmosphere, ''H'' = ''RT''/''Mg'' = (8.315*273)/(29*9.8) = 7.99, or about 8&amp;nbsp;km, which coincidentally is approximate height of [[Mount Everest|Mt. Everest]].

For an isothermal atmosphere,  &lt;math&gt;(1-\frac{1}{e})&lt;/math&gt; or about 63% of the total mass of the atmosphere exists between the planet's surface and one scale height.  (The total air mass below a certain altitude is calculated by integrating over the density function.)

For the ocean example there was a sharp transition in density at the top or "surface" of the ocean.  However, for atmospheres made of gas there is no equivalent sharp transition or edge.  Gas atmospheres simply get less and less dense until they're so thin that they're space.

[[Image:Isothermal-barotropic atmosphere model.png]]

===The U.S. Standard Atmosphere===
{{Main|U.S. Standard Atmosphere}}
The U.S. Standard Atmosphere model starts with many of the same assumptions as the isothermal-barotropic model, including ideal gas behavior, and constant molecular weight, but it differs by defining a more realistic temperature function, consisting of eight data points connected by straight lines; i.e. regions of constant temperature gradient. (See graph.)   Of course the real atmosphere does not have a temperature distribution with this exact shape.  The temperature function is an approximation.  Values for pressure and density are then calculated based on this temperature function, and the constant temperature gradients help to make some of the maths easier.

===NASA Global Reference Atmospheric Model===

The NASA Earth Global Reference Atmospheric Model (Earth-GRAM) was developed by the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] to provide a design reference atmosphere that, unlike the standard atmospheres, allows for geographical variability, a wide range of altitudes (surface to orbital altitudes), and different months and times of day.  It can also simulate spatial and temporal perturbations in atmospheric parameters due to turbulence and other atmospheric perturbation phenomena.  It is available&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Software Catalog 2015–2016 | chapter = Earth Global Reference Atmospheric Model (Earth-Gram) 2010 | publisher = NASA – Technology Transfer Program | place =  | url = https://software.nasa.gov/software/MFS-32780-1 | accessdate = 16 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in computer code written in [[Fortran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Leslie | first = F.W. | last2 = Justus | first2 = C.G. | date = June 2011 | title = The NASA Marshall Space Flight Center Earth Global Reference Atmospheric Model—2010 Version | series = NASA/TM—2011–216467 | publisher = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | place = Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama | url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110012696.pdf | accessdate = 15 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GRAM series also includes atmospheric models for the planets [[Venus]], [[Mars]] and [[Neptune]] and the [[Saturn]]ian moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Justh | first = Hilary L. | last2 = Justus | first2 = C.

==Geopotential altitude==

Gravitational acceleration, [[gravitational acceleration|''g''(z)]], decreases with altitude since moving up means moving away from the planet's center.

:&lt;math&gt;g(z) = \frac{G m_e}{(r_e + z)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

This problem of decreasing ''g'' can be dealt with by defining a transformation from real geometric altitude ''z'' to an abstraction called "geopotential altitude" ''h'', defined: 
:&lt;math&gt;h = \frac{r_e z}{r_e + z} &lt;/math&gt;

''h'' has the property 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{} g(z) dz = g_0 dh &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g_0 = g(0) = \frac{G m_e}{{r_e}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Which basically says the amount of work done lifting a  test mass ''m'' to height ''z'' through an atmosphere where gravity decreases with altitude, is the same as the amount of work done lifting that same mass to a height ''h'' through an atmosphere where ''g'' magically remains equal to ''g0'', its value at sea level.  
 
This geopotential altitude ''h'' is then used instead of geometric altitude ''z'' in the hydrostatic equations.

==Common models==
* The [[US Standard Atmosphere]] is one of the most common models
* The [[International Standard Atmosphere]] is a related international standard
* [[Jet standard atmosphere]]
* [[NRLMSISE-00]] is a recent model from [[US Naval Research Laboratory|NRL]] often used in the atmospheric sciences
* The [[Jacchia Reference Atmosphere]] is an older model still commonly used in spacecraft dynamics

'''Behaviouralism''' (or '''behavioralism''') is an approach in [[political science]] that emerged in the 1930s in the United States. It represented a sharp break from previous approaches in emphasizing an objective, quantified approach to explain and predict political behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, p. 58 says, "Behaviouralism emphasized the systematic understanding of all identifiable manifestations of political behaviour. But it also meant the application of rigorous scientific and statistical methods to standardize testing and to attempt value free inquiry of the world of politics... For the behaviouralist, the role of political science is primarily to gather and analyze facts as rigorously and objectively as possible."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petro, p. 6 says, "Behavioralists generally felt that politics should be studied much in the same way hard sciences are studied."&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with the rise of the [[behavioral sciences|behavioural sciences]], modeled after the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy p. 58 says, "The term behaviouralism was recognized as part of a larger scientific movement occurring simultaneously in ''all'' of the social sciences, now referred to as the behavioural sciences."&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviouralism claims it can explain political behaviour from an unbiased, neutral point of view.

Behaviouralism seeks to examine the behaviour, actions, and acts of individuals – rather than the characteristics of institutions such as legislatures, executives, and judiciaries  – and groups in different social settings and explain this behavior as it relates to the political system.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
From 1942 through the 1970s, behaviouralism gained support. It was David Easton who started it in the study of political systems.  It was the site of discussion between traditionalist and new emerging approaches to political science.&lt;ref&gt;Eulau, pp 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of behaviouralism is often attributed to the work of [[University of Chicago]] professor [[Charles Merriam]] who in the 1920s and 1930s, emphasized the importance of examining political behaviour of individuals and groups rather than only considering how they abide by legal or formal rules.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a political approach ==
Prior to the "behaviouralist revolution", political science being a science at all was disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, p. 763&lt;/ref&gt; Critics saw the study of politics as being primarily qualitative and normative, and claimed that it lacked a scientific method necessary to be deemed a science.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, p. 57 says, "On the basis of the philosophical approach, traditionalists prescribe normative solutions to political problems. In their view, no political inquiry into social problems can remain neutral or completely free of normative judgements or prescriptions."&lt;/ref&gt;
Behaviouralists used strict methodology and empirical research to validate their study as a [[social science]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy p 58&lt;/ref&gt; The behaviouralist approach was innovative because it changed the attitude of the purpose of inquiry. It moved toward research that was supported by verifiable facts.&lt;ref&gt;Kegley, p 48&lt;/ref&gt; During its rise in popularity in the 1960s and '70s, behaviouralism challenged the realist and liberal approaches, which the behaviouralists called "traditionalism", and other studies of political behaviour that was not based on fact.

To understand political behaviour, behaviouralism uses the following methods: sampling, interviewing, scoring and scaling and statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Petro, p 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviouralism studies how individuals behave in group positions realistically rather than how they should behave. For example, a study of the [[United States Congress]] might include a consideration of how members of Congress behave in their positions. The subject of interest is how Congress becomes an 'arena of actions' and the surrounding formal and informal spheres of power.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, p 15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning of the term ==
[[David Easton]] was the first to differentiate behaviouralism from [[behaviourism]] in the 1950s (behaviourism is the term mostly associated with psychology).&lt;ref&gt;Easton (1953) p 151&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1940s, behaviourism itself was referred to as a behavioural science and later referred to as behaviourism. However, Easton sought to differentiate between the two disciplines:&lt;ref name="Berndtson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/tutkimus/julkaisut/verkko/behavior.htm|title=Behavioralism: Origins of the Concept|last=Berndtson|accessdate=2009-04-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514010256/http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/tutkimus/julkaisut/verkko/behavior.htm|archivedate=14 May 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Behavioralism was not a clearly defined movement for those who were thought to be behavioralists. It was more clearly definable by those who were opposed to it, because they were describing it in terms of the things within the newer trends that they found objectionable. So some would define behavioralism as an attempt to apply the methods of natural sciences to human behavior. Others would define it as an excessive emphasis upon quantification. Others as individualistic reductionism. From the inside, the practitioners were of different minds as what it was that constituted behavioralism. [...] And few of us were in agreement.&lt;ref&gt;David Easton in Baer et al. eds, 1991 p 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With this in mind, behaviouralism resisted a single definition. [[Dwight Waldo]] emphasized that behaviouralism itself is unclear, calling it "complicated" and "obscure."&lt;ref&gt;Waldo, p 58&lt;/ref&gt; Easton agreed, stating, "every man puts his own emphasis and thereby becomes his own behaviouralist" and attempts to completely define behaviouralism are fruitless.&lt;ref&gt;Easton (1962) p 9&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, behaviouralism was a political, not a scientific concept. Moreover, since behaviouralism is not a research tradition, but a political movement, definitions of behaviouralism follow what behaviouralists wanted.&lt;ref name="Berndtson" /&gt; Therefore, most introductions to the subject emphasize value-free research. This is evidenced by Easton's eight "intellectual foundation stones" of behaviouralism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staff.jccc.net/bwright1/Introreview2.htm|title=Introduction to Political Science. Exam 2 Study guide|accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riemer, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Regularities'' - The generalization and explanation of regularities.
# ''Commitment to Verification'' - The ability to verify ones generalizations.
# ''Techniques'' - An experimental attitude toward techniques.
# ''Quantification'' - Express results as numbers where possible or meaningful.
# ''Values'' - Keeping ethical assessment and empirical explanations distinct.
# ''Systemization'' - Considering the importance of theory in research.
# ''Pure Science'' - Deferring to pure science rather than applied science.
# ''Integration'' - Integrating social sciences and value.

Subsequently, much of the behavioralist approach has been challenged by the emergence of [[postpositivism]] in political (particularly international relations) theory.

== Objectivity and value-neutrality ==
According to David Easton, behaviouralism sought to be "analytic, not substantive, general rather than particular, and explanatory rather than ethical."&lt;ref name="Riemer, p. 101"&gt;Riemer, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the theory seeks to evaluate political behaviour without "introducing any ethical evaluations."  Rodger Beehler cites this as "their insistence on distinguishing between facts and values."&lt;ref name="Beehler p 91"&gt;Beehler p 91&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The approach has come under fire from both conservatives and radicals for the purported value-neutrality. Conservatives see the distinction between values and facts as a way of undermining the possibility of [[political philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Beehler p 91"/&gt;  Neal Riemer believes behaviouralism dismisses "the task of ethical recommendation"&lt;ref name="Riemer, p. 101"/&gt; because behaviouralists believe "truth or falsity of values (democracy, equality, and freedom, etc.) cannot be established scientifically and are beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;Somit, pp 176–180&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Bay]] believed behaviouralism was a pseudopolitical science and that it did not represent "genuine" political research.&lt;ref name="Riemer, p. 51"&gt;Riemer, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Bay objected to empirical consideration taking precedence over normative and moral examination of politics.&lt;ref name="Riemer, p. 51"/&gt;

Behaviouralism initially represented a movement away from "[[naive empiricism]]", but as an approach has been criticized for "naive scientism".&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, p 116&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, radical critics believe that the separation of fact from value makes the empirical study of politics impossible.&lt;ref name="Beehler p 91"/&gt;

===Crick's critique===
British scholar [[Bernard Crick]] in ''The American Science of Politics'' (1959), attacked the behavioural approach to politics, which was dominant in the United States, but little known in Britain.  He identified and rejected six basic premises and in each case argued the traditional approach was superior to behaviouralism:
#research can discover uniformities in human behaviour,
#these uniformities could be confirmed by empirical tests and measurements,
#quantitative data was of the highest quality, and should be analyzed statistically,
#political science should be empirical and predictive, downplaying the philosophical and historical dimensions,
#value-free research was the ideal, and
#social scientists should search for a macro theory covering all the social sciences, as opposed to applied issues of practical reform.&lt;ref&gt;"Crick, Bernard," in John Ramsden, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-century British Politics'' (2002)  p 174&lt;/ref&gt;

AD is also considered a [[tauopathy]] due to abnormal aggregation of the [[tau protein]], a [[microtubule-associated protein]] expressed in neurons that normally acts to stabilize [[microtubules]] in the cell [[cytoskeleton]]. Like most microtubule-associated proteins, tau is normally regulated by [[phosphorylation]]; however, in AD patients, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates as paired helical filaments&lt;ref name="Goedert"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goedert M, Klug A, Crowther RA |title=Tau protein, the paired helical filament and Alzheimer's disease |journal=J.

Although little is known about the process of filament assembly, it has recently been shown that a depletion of a [[prolyl isomerase]] protein in the [[parvulin]] family accelerates the accumulation of abnormal tau.&lt;ref name="Pastorino"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pastorino L, Sun A, Lu PJ |title=The prolyl isomerase Pin1 regulates amyloid precursor protein processing and amyloid-beta production |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7083 |pages=528–34 |year=2006 |pmid=16554819 |doi=10.1038/nature04543|bibcode = 2006Natur.440..528P |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lim"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lim J, Lu KP |title=Pinning down phosphorylated tau and tauopathies |journal=Biochim.

Neuroinflammation is also involved in the complex cascade leading to AD pathology and symptoms.

==Neuropathology==

At a [[macroscopic]] level, AD is characterized by loss of [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s in the [[cerebral cortex]] and certain subcortical regions. This results in gross [[atrophy]] of the affected regions, including degeneration in the [[temporal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]], and parts of the [[frontal cortex]] and [[cingulate gyrus]].&lt;ref name="pmid12934968"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wenk GL |title=Neuropathologic changes in Alzheimer's disease |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=64 Suppl 9 |issue= |pages=7–10 |year=2003 |pmid=12934968 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[amyloid plaques]] and [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s are clearly visible by [[microscopy]] in AD brains.&lt;ref name="Tiraboschi"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tiraboschi P, Hansen L, Thal L, Corey-Bloom J | title = The importance of neuritic plaques and tangles to the development and evolution of AD | journal = Neurology | volume = 62 | issue = 11 | pages = 1984–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15184601 | doi = 10.1212/01.WNL.0000129697.01779.0A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaques are dense, mostly [[insoluble]] deposits of [[protein]] and [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] material outside and around neurons. Tangles are insoluble twisted fibers that build up inside the nerve cell. Though many older people develop some plaques and tangles, the brains of AD patients have them to a much greater extent and in different brain locations.&lt;ref name="pmid8038565"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bouras C, Hof PR, Giannakopoulos P, Michel JP, Morrison JH |title=Regional distribution of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques in the cerebral cortex of elderly patients: a quantitative evaluation of a one-year autopsy population from a geriatric hospital |journal=Cereb.

==Biochemical characteristics==
Fundamental to the understanding of Alzheimer's disease is the biochemical events that leads to accumulation of the amyloid-beta and tau-protein. A delicate balance of the enzymes secretases regulate the amyloid-beta accumulation. The alpha-secretase activity discourages its accumulation. Recently, a link between cholinergic neuronal activity and the activity of alpha-secretase has been highlighted,&lt;ref&gt;Baig AM. Connecting the Dots: Linking the Biochemical to Morphological Transitions in Alzheimer's Disease. ACS Chem Neurosci. 2018 Aug 30. doi: 10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00409. [Epub ahead of print] PubMed {{PMID|30160095}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which can discourage Amyloid-beta proteins deposition in brain of patients with Alzheimer's Disease.  
Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a [[protein folding|protein misfolding]] disease, or [[proteopathy]], due to the accumulation of abnormally folded Amyloid-beta proteins in the brains of AD patients.&lt;ref name="Hashimoto"/&gt; Abnormal amyloid-beta accumulation can first be detected using cerebrospinal fluid analysis and later using positron emission tomography (PET).&lt;ref name="Palmqvist"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palmqvist|first1=Sebastian|title=Cerebrospinal fluid analysis detects cerebral amyloid-β accumulation earlier than positron emission tomography, 2016 Apr; 139(4)|journal=Brain|doi=10.1093/brain/aww015|pmid=26936941|volume=139|issue=Pt 4|pmc=4806222|year=2016|pages=1226–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although AD shares pathophysiological mechanisms with prion diseases, it is not transmissible like prion diseases.&lt;ref name="Castellani"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Castellni RJ, Perry G, Smith MA | title = Prion disease and Alzheimer's disease: pathogenic overlap | journal = Acta Neurobiol Exp (Wars)| year = 2004 | pmid = 15190676 | volume=64 | issue = 1 | pages=11–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amyloid-beta, also written Aβ, is a short [[peptide]] that is a [[proteolysis|proteolytic]] byproduct of the [[transmembrane protein]] [[amyloid precursor protein]] (APP), whose function is unclear but thought to be involved in neuronal development. The [[presenilin]]s are components of a proteolytic complex involved in APP processing and degradation.&lt;ref name="Cai"/&gt;
Although amyloid beta [[monomer]]s are harmless, they undergo a dramatic [[conformational change]] at sufficiently high concentration to form a [[beta sheet]]-rich [[tertiary structure]] that aggregates to form [[amyloid|amyloid fibrils]]&lt;ref name="Ohnishi"/&gt; that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as ''senile plaques'' or ''neuritic plaques'', in less dense aggregates as ''diffuse plaques'', and sometimes in the walls of small blood vessels in the brain in a process called amyloid angiopathy or [[congophilic angiopathy]].

AD is also considered a [[tauopathy]] due to abnormal aggregation of the [[tau protein]], a [[microtubule-associated protein]] expressed in neurons that normally acts to stabilize [[microtubules]] in the cell [[cytoskeleton]]. Like most microtubule-associated proteins, tau is normally regulated by [[phosphorylation]]; however, in AD patients, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates as paired helical filaments&lt;ref name="Goedert"/&gt; that in turn aggregate into masses inside nerve cell bodies known as ''neurofibrillary tangles'' and as dystrophic [[neurite]]s associated with amyloid plaques.

Levels of the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]] (ACh) are reduced. Levels  of other neurotransmitters [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[somatostatin]] are also often reduced. Replenishing the ACh by anti-cholinerstrases is an approved mode of treatment by FDA. An alternative method of stimulating ACh receptors of M1-M3 types by synthetic agonists that have a slower rate of dissociation from the receptor has been proposed as next generation cholinomimetic in Alzheimer's disease&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Disease mechanism==
Although the gross histological features of AD in the brain are well characterized, three major hypotheses have been advanced regarding the primary cause. The oldest hypothesis suggests that deficiency in [[cholinergic]] signaling initiates the progression of the disease. Two alternative misfolding hypotheses instead suggest that either tau protein or amyloid beta initiates the cascade. While researchers have not identified a clear causative pathway originating from any of the three molecular hypotheses to explain the gross anatomical changes observed in advanced AD, variants of the amyloid beta hypothesis of molecular initiation have become dominant among the three possibilities.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

===Cholinergic hypothesis===

The oldest hypothesis is the "cholinergic hypothesis". It states that Alzheimer's begins as a deficiency in the production of [[acetylcholine]], a vital [[neurotransmitter]]. Much early therapeutic research was based on this hypothesis, including restoration of the "cholinergic nuclei". The possibility of cell-replacement therapy was investigated on the basis of this hypothesis. All of the first-generation anti-Alzheimer's medications are based on this hypothesis and work to preserve acetylcholine by inhibiting [[acetylcholinesterase]]s (enzymes that break down acetylcholine). These medications, though sometimes beneficial, have not led to a cure. In all cases, they have served to only treat symptoms of the disease and have neither halted nor reversed it. These results and other research have led to the conclusion that acetylcholine deficiencies may not be directly causal, but are a result of widespread brain tissue damage, damage so widespread that cell-replacement therapies are likely to be impractical. More recently, cholinergic effects have been proposed as a potential causative agent for the formation of plaques and tangles&lt;ref name="Shen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shen ZX |title=Brain cholinesterases: II. The molecular and cellular basis of Alzheimer's disease |journal=Med. Hypotheses |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=308–21 |year=2004 |pmid=15236795 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2004.02.031}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to generalized neuroinflammation.&lt;ref name="Wenk"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wenk GL |title=Neuropathologic changes in Alzheimer's disease |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=64 Suppl 9 |issue= |pages=7–10 |year=2003 |pmid=12934968 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent hypotheses center on the effects of the misfolded and aggregated proteins, amyloid beta and tau. The two positions are lightheartedly described as "ba-ptist" and "tau-ist" viewpoints in one scientific publication. Therein, it is suggested that "Tau-ists" believe that the [[tau protein]] abnormalities initiate the disease cascade, while "ba-ptists" believe that [[beta amyloid]] deposits are the causative factor in the disease.&lt;ref name="Mudher"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mudher A, Lovestone S |title=Alzheimer's disease-do tauists and baptists finally shake hands? |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=22–6 |year=2002 |pmid=11801334 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(00)02031-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tau hypothesis===

The hypothesis that tau is the primary causative factor has long been grounded in the observation that deposition of amyloid plaques does not correlate well with neuron loss.&lt;ref name="Schmitz"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmitz C, Rutten BP, Pielen A |title=Hippocampal neuron loss exceeds amyloid plaque load in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease |journal=Am.

===Amyloid hypothesis===

The amyloid hypothesis is initially compelling because the gene for the amyloid beta precursor APP is located on [[chromosome 21]], and patients with [[trisomy 21]] - better known as Down syndrome - who thus have an extra [[gene dosage|gene copy]] almost universally exhibit AD-like disorders by 40 years of age.&lt;ref name="Nistor"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nistor M, Don M, Parekh M |title=Alpha- and beta-secretase activity as a function of age and beta-amyloid in Down syndrome and normal brain |journal=Neurobiol.

The increase in the sugar carrier dolichyl phosphate may reflect an increased rate of [[glycosylation]] in the diseased brain and the increase in the endogenous [[anti-oxidant]] [[ubiquinone]] an attempt to protect the brain from [[oxidative stress]], for instance induced by [[lipid peroxidation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Edlund C, Söderberg M, Kristensson K |journal=Neurochem Int|date=July 1994|volume=25|issue=1|pages=35–8|doi=10.1016/0197-0186(94)90050-7|pmid=7950967|title=Isoprenoids in aging and neurodegeneration}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[solagran#Ropren|Ropren]], identified previously in Russia, is neuroprotective in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16913416|language=Russian|laysummary=http://www.biotechnologynews.net/storyview.asp?storyid=68509&amp;sectionsource=s0/|year=2006|last1=Sviderskii|first1=VL|last2=Khovanskikh|first2=AE|last3=Rozengart|first3=EV|last4=Moralev|first4=SN|last5=Yagodina|first5=OV|last6=Gorelkin|first6=VS|last7=Basova|first7=IN|last8=Kormilitsyn|first8=BN|last9=Nikitina|first9=TV|last10=Roshchin|first10=V.

==Glucose consumption==
The human brain is one of the most metabolically active organs in the body and metabolizes a large amount of glucose to produce cellular energy in the form of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP).&lt;ref name=Reference2&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cunnane S, Nugent S, Roy M | year = 2011 | title = Brain fuel metabolism, aging, and Alzheimer's disease | url = | journal = Nutrition | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 3–20 | doi=10.1016/j.nut.2010.07.021|display-authors=etal | pmid=21035308 | pmc=3478067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its high energy demands, the brain is relatively inflexible in its ability to utilize substrates for energy production and relies almost entirely on circulating glucose for its energy needs.&lt;ref name=Reference7&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Costantini LC, Barr LJ, Vogel JL, Henderson ST | year = 2008 | title = Hypometabolism as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease | url = | journal = BMC Neurosci | volume = 9 | issue = Suppl 2| page = S16 | doi=10.1186/1471-2202-9-s2-s16| pmid = 19090989 | pmc = 2604900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This dependence on glucose puts the brain at risk if the supply of glucose is interrupted, or if its ability to metabolize glucose becomes defective. If the brain is not able to produce ATP, synapses cannot be maintained and cells cannot function, ultimately leading to impaired cognition.&lt;ref name="Reference7"/&gt;

Imaging studies have shown decreased utilization of glucose in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease patients early in the disease, before clinical signs of cognitive impairment occur. This decrease in [[glucose metabolism]] worsens as clinical symptoms develop and the disease progresses.&lt;ref name=Reference8&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hoyer S | year = 1992 | title = Oxidative energy metabolism in Alzheimer brain. Studies in early-onset and late-onset cases | url = | journal = Mol Chem Neuropathol | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 207–224 | doi=10.1007/bf03159971 | pmid=1418218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reference9&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Small GW, Ercoli LM, Silverman DH | year = 2000 | title = Cerebral metabolic and cognitive decline in persons at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease | doi = 10.1073/pnas.090106797 | pmid = 10811879 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 97 | issue = 11| pages = 6037–6042 |display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2000PNAS...97.6037S |pmc = 18554 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have found a 17%-24% decline in cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, compared with age-matched controls.&lt;ref name=Reference10&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=De Leon MJ, Ferris SH, George AE | year = 1983 | title = Positron emission tomographic studies of aging and Alzheimer disease | url = | journal = Am J Neuroradiol | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 568–571 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous imaging studies have since confirmed this observation.

Abnormally low rates of cerebral glucose metabolism are found in a characteristic pattern in the Alzheimer’s disease brain, particularly in the posterior cingulate, parietal, temporal, and prefrontal cortices. These brain regions are believed to control multiple aspects of [[memory]] and [[cognition]]. This metabolic pattern is reproducible and has even been proposed as a diagnostic tool for Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, diminished cerebral glucose metabolism (DCGM) correlates with plaque density and cognitive deficits in patients with more advanced disease.&lt;ref name="Reference10"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reference11&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meier-Ruge W, Bertoni-Freddari C, Iwangoff P | year = 1994 | title = Changes in brain glucose metabolism as a key to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease | url = | journal = Gerontology | volume = 40 | issue = 5| pages = 246–252 | doi=10.1159/000213592 | pmid=7959080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diminished cerebral glucose metabolism (DCGM) may not be solely an artifact of brain cell loss since it occurs in asymptomatic patients at risk for Alzheimer’s disease, such as patients homozygous for the epsilon 4 variant of the [[apolipoprotein E]] gene (APOE4, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease), as well as in inherited forms of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;ref name=Reference4&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reiman EM, Chen K, Alexander GE | year = 2004 | title = Functional brain abnormalities in young adults at genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer's dementia | doi = 10.1073/pnas.2635903100 | pmid = 14688411 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 101 | issue = 1| pages = 284–289 |display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2003PNAS..101..284R |pmc = 314177 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that DCGM occurs before other clinical and pathological changes occur, it is unlikely to be due to the gross cell loss observed in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;ref name="Reference7"/&gt;

In imaging studies involving young adult APOE4 carriers, where there were no signs of cognitive impairment, diminished cerebral glucose metabolism (DCGM) was detected in the same areas of the brain as older subjects with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;ref name=Reference4 /&gt; However, DCGM is not exclusive to APOE4 carriers. By the time Alzheimer’s has been diagnosed, DCGM occurs in genotypes APOE3/E4, APOE3/E3, and APOE4/E4.&lt;ref name=Reference12&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Corder EH, Jelic V, Basun H | year = 1997 | title = No difference in cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with Alzheimer disease and differing apolipoprotein E genotypes | url = | journal = Arch Neurol | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 273–277 | doi=10.1001/archneur.1997.00550150035013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, DCGM is a metabolic [[biomarker]] for the disease state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diminished cerebral glucose metabolism: A key pathology in Alzheimer's disease|url=http://www.about-axona.com/assets/files/us-en/hcp/pdf/KAXO1056_DCGM_Adv_NR_MV01a.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insulin signaling ==

==Oxidative stress==

==Large gene instability hypothesis==
A bioinformatics analysis in 2017&lt;ref name="B1897"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2017 |title= Alzheimer's disease: the large gene instability hypothesis |journal= bioRxiv |doi= 10.1101/189712|last1= Soheili-Nezhad |first1= Sourena }}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that extremely large human genes are significantly over-expressed in brain and take part in the postsynaptic architecture. These genes are also highly enriched in cell adhesion Gene Ontology (GO) terms and often map to chromosomal fragile sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=D.I.|date=2005-10-14|title=Common fragile sites, extremely large genes, neural development and cancer|url=http://www.cancerletters.info/article/S0304-3835(05)00823-2/fulltext|journal=Cancer Letters|language=en|volume=232|issue=1|pages=48–57|doi=10.1016/j.canlet.2005.06.049|pmid=16221525|issn=0304-3835}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of known Alzheimer's disease risk gene products including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and gamma-secretase, as well as the APOE receptors and GWAS risk loci take part in similar cell adhesion mechanisms. It was concluded that dysfunction of cell and synaptic adhesion is central to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and mutational instability of large synaptic adhesion genes may be the etiological trigger of neurotransmission disruption and synaptic loss in brain aging. As a typical example, this hypothesis explains the APOE risk locus of AD in context of signaling of its giant lipoprotein receptor, LRP1b which is a large tumor-suppressor gene with brain-specific expression and also maps to an unstable chromosomal fragile site. The large gene instability hypothesis puts the DNA damage mechanism at the center of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.

'''The Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies''' (abbreviated '''CAPS''') is an [[independent research]] centre based in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]]. The centre came into being in July 2006.

CAPS is one of the very few research centres in Afghanistan that are managed and staffed by [[Afghan people|Afghans]]. The centre is engaged in research and policy analysis; education and training; and capacity building and knowledge sharing.

The centre focuses its research on issues pertaining to [[governance]], [[security]], and [[International development|development]]al challenges in Afghanistan. CAPS is also active in sharing its research findings with the Afghans as well as with the international community. It provides pre-deployment training to various contingents of the international community that are deployed in Afghanistan.

Through these activities, Chicago Wilderness played a major role in protecting and replenishing the naturally occurring [[ecosystems]] in the Chicago area as well as motivating people to become more aware and involved in the preservation of these lands and waters. Chicago Wilderness had continued to blossom through the funding and donations of many sources including private contributions, the member organizations, and state and federal [[grants]].&lt;ref&gt;"Chicago Wilderness."

==History==

In the 1970s the Illinois Natural Areas Inventory selected the best quality surviving [[natural]] habitats within the state. All of these areas combined constituted seven-hundredths of one percent of the original [[land mass]] it once covered.&lt;ref&gt;Packard, Stephen. "Chicago Wilderness." Encyclopedia of Chicago. Ed. Janice L. Reiff, Ann D. Keating, and James R. Grossman. Chicago Historical Society, 2005. Web. 21 Jan. 2012. &lt;http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/328.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to this dramatic decrease of naturally occurring ecosystems, the Chicago Region Biodiversity Council, or Chicago Wilderness, was formed in 1996. This collection of 34 separate organizations, including state, local, and federal agencies, joined forces as they all shared a common vision consisting of the restoration and improvement of the [[biodiversity]] of the Chicago area. In 2002, Chicago Wilderness established its Corporate Council.&lt;ref&gt;Jerozal, Jim. "Chicago Wilderness And its Corporate Council." Illinois Sustainable Technology Center. Ed. Bob Iverson. [[Prairie Research Institute]], 2012. Web. 22 Jan. 2012. &lt;http://www.istc.illinois.edu/info/govs_awards_docs/2008-GP2A-Jerozal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The Corporate Council, which includes 34 organizations, was created to influence a healthy relationship between people and nature and to continue to increase the biological diversity within the region.&lt;ref name=USFishWildlife&gt;Chicago Wilderness. [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service]], 2011. Web. 21 Jan. 2012.&lt;http://www.chicagowilderness.org&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was established, Chicago Wilderness has increased its member count to over 250 different public and private organizations who work together to conserve and protect these diminishing ecosystems.

On March 29, 2017, the leadership of Chicago Wilderness announced that the Chicago Wilderness Trust would be ceasing operations effective March 31. This message stated that its Chair and Vice Chair, and their alliance partner organizations, were "committed to working with the Executive Council and other alliance members to determine the best strategy for moving forward".&lt;ref name="CWTransition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagowilderness.org/news/338001/Chicago-Wilderness-Transition.htm|title=Chicago Wilderness Transition|date=29 March 2017|author=Game, Catherine|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a June 5, 2017 email from the Chair and Vice-Chair, a "Status Report" was provided about the progress of an Ad Hoc Transition Working Group transitioning the organization from a staffed one to a volunteer-driven effort.

==Land Area==
Chicago Wilderness stretches from southwest [[Michigan]], to northwest [[Indiana]], reaching through northern [[Illinois]], and southern [[Wisconsin]]. It is home to a variety of ecosystems sustaining life to thousands of native plants and animal species, including almost 200 listed [[endangered]] or [[threatened species]] in Illinois.&lt;ref name=ChicagoZoo&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The various ecological communities contain: [[prairies]], woodlands, including [[savannas]], open woodlands, [[flatwoods]] and [[forests]], [[wetlands]], which encompass [[marshes]], [[sedge]] meadows, [[bogs]], [[seeps]], [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] and [[swamp]]s, [[river]]s and [[lake]]s.&lt;ref name=USFishWildlife&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Four Main Initiatives==
Chicago Wilderness has four major initiatives it strives to improve through its presence: Climate Change, Green Infrastructure Vision: Bringing Nature to People, Leave No Child Inside, and Restoring the Health of Local Nature.&lt;ref name=USFishWildlife&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Included in these core projects, the Chicago Wilderness alliance encompasses a variety of other programs to benefit the members of the [[community]] as well as the land they are preserving.

===Climate Change===
The [[climate change]] initiative of Chicago Wilderness focuses primarily on addressing the effects of climate change on the Chicago wilderness region and ways to respond to these changes. Studies have shown the impact of climate change has on the world, but little is known about how it affects specific regions. Recently, both Chicago Wilderness and the Nature Conservancy published reports to address the issues the area faces as the climate changes, both from the perspective of the city and the region's wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;April, Kelly. "Conservationists around Great Lakes Plan for Climate Change - Chicago Tribune." Featured Articles From The [[Chicago Tribune]]. 28 Aug. 2011. Web. 10 Feb. 2012. &lt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-08-28/news/ct-met-climate-change-conservation-20110828_1_climate-change-warmer-winters-great-lakes&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the reports, the Chicago Wilderness Alliance also developed the Climate Action Plan for Nature, which has established plans for the city of Chicago ([[Chicago Climate Action Plan]]), the city of [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], and the [[University of Illinois]]. The Climate Action Plan has five strategies it is currently working on: Energy efficient buildings, clean and renewable energy sources, improved transportation options, reduce waste and industrial pollution, and finally adaption. Green-covered roofs on some of Chicago's buildings are key features of projects implemented as part of their climate action plan.&lt;ref&gt;"Cities and Climate Change: Greening the Concrete Jungle | The Economist." [[The Economist]] - World News, Politics, Economics, Business &amp; Finance. Web. 10 Feb. 2012. &lt;http://www.economist.com/node/21528272&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green Infrastructure Vision===
As according to Chicago wilderness, Green Infrastructure is defined as "the interconnected network of land and water that supports biodiversity and provides habitat for diverse communities of native flora and fauna at the regional scale." The Green Infrastructure Vision (GIV) was proposed in 2004. Its main purpose is to create a healthy region that plays a role in the quality of life of residents, to increase the economic liveliness of the region and to bring the [[nature]] to the people by protecting, preserving, restoring and managing biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;"Chicago Wilderness Green Infrastructure Vision." Chicago Wilderness. U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service and [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Ser.]], Mar. 2004. Web. 12 Feb. 2012. &lt;http://www.chicagowilderness.org/pdf/Green_Infrastructure_Vision_Final_Report.pdf&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313200041/http://www.chicagowilderness.org/pdf/Green_Infrastructure_Vision_Final_Report.pdf |date=March 13, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are 1.8 million acres that are potential areas of expansion, protection, restoration and connection for the GIV in Southwest [[Wisconsin]], [[Northeast Illinois]], Northwest Indiana, and Southwest [[Michigan]].

Chicago wilderness works to put the green infrastructure vision into action by focusing on four main scales: Regional, Community, Neighborhood and Site. At a regional level, CW members work with regional agencies. By looking at future plans and policies, they can focus on including conservation developmental and preservation principles that promote and sustain community health. In the community, land use ordinances and plans will be reworked to enhance people friendly design, while integrating such principles as [[sustainability]], biodiversity and [[Conservation biology|conservation]]. GIV works at a neighborhood level to further promotion of conservation, preservation and access to nature in communities. At a more specific level, they work with specific sites to encourage use of [[rain gardens]], rain barrels (also known as [[rainwater tanks]]), and [[natural landscaping]] in open spaces in the community.&lt;ref&gt;"Green Infrastructure Vision: Bringing Nature to People."

SWAT focuses at the scale of neighborhoods and communities.&lt;ref&gt;"SUSTAINABLE WATERSHED ACTION TEAM ARCHIVE." [[Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning]] Publications. N.p., n.d.

===Leave No Child Inside===
The Leave No Child Inside Initiative focuses on connecting children of all ages with the nature in their region. Projects sponsored by this initiative give children and teens the opportunities to explore nature, camping, and service learning projects.&lt;ref&gt;Leave No Child Inside, Chicago Wilderness Initiative. U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service and U.S. Forest Ser, n.d. Web. 12 Feb. 2012. &lt;http://www.kidsoutside.info/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative was created in sync with the movement, [[No Child Left Inside (movement)]]. This movement has prompted other states to start their own programs similar to the one of Chicago Wilderness; Leave No Child Inside, [[Greater Cincinnati]] &lt;ref&gt;Leave No Child Inside, Greater Cincinnati. N.p., n.d. Web. 12 Feb. 2012. &lt;http://www.lncigc.org/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  and No Child Left Inside, [[Connecticut]] &lt;ref&gt;State Of Connecticut: No Child Left Inside. State of Connecticut, n.d. Web. 12 Feb. 2012. &lt;http://www.ct.gov/ncli/site/default.asp&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; are just a few.

===Restoring the Health of Local Nature===
The Restoring the Health of Local Nature initiatives main purpose is to help return the environment in the Chicago region to its once healthy condition. The Chicago Wilderness has implemented projects that allow people to enjoy clean air, water and help restore and preserve their environment.&lt;ref&gt;"Restoring the Health of Local Nature." Chicago Wilderness. U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service and U.S. Forest Ser, n.d.

Chicago Wilderness sponsors 15 different sites at which volunteers can help at on this day.&lt;ref&gt;"NPLD in Your Town: Chicago." [[National Public Lands Day]].

==Accomplishments==
Since 1996, Chicago Wilderness has undertaken more than 500 environmental projects in the Chicago region. The foundation has received over 38 grants totaling over $15 million to support conservation projects.&lt;ref&gt;"Recent Accomplishments — Chicago Wilderness." Chicago Wilderness.

'''Cultural psychology '''is the study of how cultures reflect and shape the psychological processes of their members.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Heine, S. J. (2011). ''Cultural Psychology. ''New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main tenet of cultural psychology is that mind and culture are inseparable and mutually constitutive, meaning that people are shaped by their culture and their culture is also shaped by them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fiske, A.; Kitayama, S.; Markus, H.R.; &amp; Nisbett, R.E. (1998). [http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/faculty/caa/Classes/Readings/Heine2010Cult-Psy.pdf The cultural matrix of social psychology]. In D. Gilbert &amp; S. Fiske &amp; G. Lindzey (Eds.), The Handbook of Social Psychology (4th ed., pp. 915–81). San Francisco: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Richard Shweder]], one of the major proponents of the field, writes, "Cultural psychology is the study of the way cultural traditions and social practices regulate, express, and transform the human psyche, resulting less in psychic unity for humankind than in ethnic divergences in mind, self, and emotion."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Shweder, Richard (1991). Thinking Through Cultures. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-88415-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationships with other branches of psychology ==
Cultural psychology is often confused with [[cross-cultural psychology]]. However, cultural psychology is distinct from cross-cultural psychology in that the cross-cultural psychologists generally use culture as a means of testing the universality of psychological processes rather than determining how local cultural practices shape psychological processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heine | first1 = S. | last2 = Ruby | first2 = M. B. | year = 2010 | title = Cultural Psychology | url = | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science | volume = 1 | issue = | page = 2 | doi = 10.1002/wcs.7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So whereas a cross-cultural psychologist might ask whether [[Jean Piaget]]'s stages of development are universal across a variety of cultures, a cultural psychologist would be interested in how the social practices of a particular set of cultures shape the development of cognitive processes in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Markus | first1 = H.R. | last2 = Kitayama | first2 = S. | year = 2003 | title = Culture, Self, and the Reality of the Social | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 277–83 | doi = 10.1207/S15327965PLI1403&amp;4_17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural psychology research informs several fields within psychology, including [[social psychology]], [[cultural-historical psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], and [[cognitive psychology]]. However, the relativist perspective of cultural psychology, through which cultural psychologists compare thought patterns and behaviors within and across cultures, tends to clash with the universal perspectives common in most fields in psychology, which seek to qualify fundamental psychological truths that are consistent across all of humanity.

== Importance ==

=== Need for expanded cultural research ===
According to [[Richard Shweder]], there has been repeated failure to replicate Western psychology laboratory findings in non-Western settings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Therefore, a major goal of cultural psychology is to have many and varied cultures contribute to basic psychological theories in order to correct these theories so that they become more relevant to the predictions, descriptions, and explanations of all human behaviors, not just Western ones.&lt;ref name="schweder84"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Shweder, R.A.|editor2=Levine, R.A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1984|title=Culture theory: Essays on mind, self, and emotion|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goal is shared by many of the scholars who promote the [[indigenous psychology]] approach. In an attempt to show the interrelated interests of cultural and indigenous psychology, cultural psychologist Pradeep Chakkarath emphasizes that international mainstream psychology, as it has been exported to most regions of the world by the so-called West, is only one among many indigenous psychologies and therefore may not have enough intercultural expertise to claim, as it frequently does, that its theories have universal validity.&lt;ref name="Chakkarath"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chakkarath, P.|year=2012|chapter-url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195396430.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195396430-e-5|chapter=The role of indigenous psychologies in the building of basic cultural psychology|editor=J. Valsiner|title=The Oxford Handbook of Culture and Psychology|pages=71–95|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acronym W.E.I.R.D. describes populations that are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. Thus far, W.E.I.R.D. populations have been vastly overrepresented in psychological research.&lt;ref name="Arnett"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arnett, J. J.|year=2008|url=http://facweb.northseattle.edu/kkuwada/Psyc%20200:Fall%202012/article16-1.pdf|title=The neglected 95%: Why American psychology needs to become less American|journal=American Psychologist|volume=63|issue=7|pages=602–614|pmid=18855491|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.63.7.602}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weirdest" /&gt; Findings from psychology research utilizing primarily W.E.I.R.D. populations are often labeled as universal theories and are inaccurately applied to other cultures.&lt;ref name=":most people are not weird"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henrich | first1 = Joseph | year = 2010 | title = Most people are not WEIRD | url = http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/jvt002/BrainMind/Readings/Henrich_2010.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 466 | issue = 5| page = 29 | doi = 10.1038/466029a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research is showing that cultures differ in many areas, such as logical reasoning and social values.&lt;ref name="weirdest"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henrich | first1 = J. | last2 = Heine | first2 = S. J. | last3 = Norenzayan | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = The weirdest people in the world? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 61–135 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X0999152X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":most people are not weird" /&gt; The evidence that basic cognitive and motivational processes vary across populations has become increasingly difficult to ignore. For example, many studies have shown that Americans, Canadians and western Europeans rely on analytical reasoning strategies, which separate objects from their contexts to explain and predict behavior. Social psychologists refer to the "[[fundamental attribution error]]" or  the tendency to explain people's behavior in terms of internal, inherent personality traits rather than external, situational considerations (e.g. attributing an instance of angry behavior to an angry personality). Outside W.E.I.R.D. cultures, however, this phenomenon is less prominent, as many non-W.E.I.R.D. populations tend to pay more attention to the context in which behavior occurs. Asians tend to reason holistically, for example by considering people's behavior in terms of their situation; someone's anger might be viewed as simply a result of an irritating day.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jones, D.|year=2010|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/media/WEIRDinScience.pdf|title=A WEIRD View of Human Nature|journal=Science |volume=328|issue=25|page=1627}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nisbettmiyamoto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nisbett | first1 = R. | last2 = Miyamoto | first2 = Y. | year = 2005 | title = The influence of culture: holistic versus analytic perception | citeseerx=10.1.1.87.43 | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 467–473 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.08.004 | pmid=16129648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet many long-standing theories of how humans think rely on the prominence of analytical thought.&lt;ref name=":most people are not weird" /&gt;

By studying only W.E.I.R.D. populations, psychologists fail to account for a substantial amount of diversity of the global population. Applying the findings from W.E.I.R.D. populations to other populations can lead to a miscalculation of psychological theories and may hinder psychologists' abilities to isolate fundamental cultural characteristics.

== Mutual constitution ==
Mutual constitution is the notion that the society and the individual have an influencing effect on one another. Because a society is composed of individuals, the behavior and actions of the individuals directly impact the society. In the same manner, society directly impacts the individual living within it. The values, morals, and ways of life a society exemplifies will have an immediate impact on the way an individual is shaped as a person. The atmosphere that a society provides for the individual is a determining factor for how an individual will develop. Furthermore, mutual constitution is a cyclical model in which the society and the individual both influence one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogoff|first1=Barbara|title=The Cultural Nature of Human Development|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513133-8|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While cultural psychology is reliant on this model, societies often fail to recognize this. Despite the overwhelming acceptance that people affect culture and culture affects people, societal systems tend to minimize the effect that people form on their communities. For example, mission statements of businesses, schools, and foundations attempt make promises regarding the environment and values that their establishment holds. However, these promises cannot be made in accordance with the mutually consisting theory without being upheld by all participants. The mission statement for the employees of Southwest Airlines, for example, makes the claim that, "...We are committed to provide our Employees a stable work environment with equal opportunity for learning and personal growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Southwest|url=https://www.southwest.com/html/about-southwest/index.html?clk=GFOOTER-ABOUT-ABOUT|website=Southwest Airlines}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the company can ensure the "equal opportunity for learning and personal growth", the aforementioned message cannot be promised. The work environment that Southwest provides includes paying consumers. While rules can be enforced to ensure ''safety'' on their aircraft, customers will not be removed due to attitude or a lack of courtesy. This therefore contradicts the promise of a "stable work environment". On the contrary, some establishments do ensure that their mission statements agree with the mutually consisting model. For example, Yale University promises within its mission statement that:
::Yale is committed to improving the world today and for future generations through outstanding research and scholarship, education, preservation, and practice. Yale educates aspiring leaders worldwide who serve all sectors of society. We carry out this mission through the free exchange of ideas in an ethical, interdependent, and diverse community of faculty, staff, students, and alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Statement|url=https://www.yale.edu/about-yale/mission-statement|website=Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Positive Example of Mutual Constitution in Society.png|thumb|This image is a representation derived from ideas found in the journal article "Cultures and Selves: A Cycle of Mutual Constitution" by Hazel Rose Markus and Shinoba Kitayama.]]
Instead of making promises that depend on all of their students and faculty, they make statements that can refer to only a part of their student/ faculty body. The statement focuses more on what they offer, and how they uphold these promises. By providing evidence they provide readers with an example as to how their school community members participate in the environment they promise, accepting the community's role in their school culture.

Past research has been conducted by middle-class North Americans analyzing culturally different societies by means of comparison mostly involving middle-class North Americans and/or aforementioned W.E.I.R.D. societies. What has been characterized as Euro-American centrism, resulted in a great volume of research for this specific selection of humans. It has also allowed us to divert from the idea that certain psychological processes can be considered basic or universal, and recognize humans' remarkable capacity to create cultures and then be shaped by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Markus |first=Hazel Rose |last2=Kitayama |first2=Shinobu |date=2010 |title=Cultures and Selves: A Cycle of Mutual Constitution |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=5 |pages=420–430 |doi=10.1177/1745691610375557}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although cultural psychology has internalized the mutually constituting model, further implementation in our society is necessary. Being aware of this model promotes taking responsibility for one's actions and the effect that their actions have on their community. Through acceptance of ones responsibilities and conscious application, communities have opportunity for improvement which in turn supports the individuals within the community. These ideas can be found in the journal article "Cultures and Selves: A Cycle of Mutual Constitution" by Hazel Rose Markus and Shinobu Kitayama which are also represented in the graphic provided.

== Criticisms ==

=== Stereotyping ===
One of the most significant themes in recent years has been cultural differences between East Asians and North Americans in [[attention]],&lt;ref name="masuda01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masuda | first1 = T. | last2 = Nisbett | first2 = R.A. | year = 2001 | title = Attending holistically versus analytically: Comparing the context sensitivity of Japanese and Americans | url = http://gsct3237.kaist.ac.kr/e-lib/Culture/Journal/Attending%20holistically%20versus%20analytically.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 81 | issue = 5 | pages = 922–34 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.81.5.922 | pmid = 11708567 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111518/http://gsct3237.kaist.ac.kr/e-lib/Culture/Journal/Attending%20holistically%20versus%20analytically.pdf | archivedate = 2013-12-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[perception]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kitayama | first1 = S. | last2 = Duffy | first2 = S. | last3 = Kawamura | first3 = T. | last4 = Larsen | first4 = J.T. | year = 2003 | title = Perceiving an object and its context in different cultures: A cultural look at new look | url = http://psy.haifa.ac.il/~ep/Students_Post/Slides/kitayama.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 201–06 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.02432 | pmid = 12741741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cognition]],&lt;ref name="cole"&gt;Cole, M.

The Culture of Morality: Social Development, Context, and Conflict. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Per Gjerde states that cultural psychology tends to "generalize about human development across nations and continents" and assigning characteristics to a culture promotes a disregard for heterogeneity and minimizes the role of the individual.&lt;ref name="uc"&gt;McNulty, Jennifer (2004, July 26). "[http://news.ucsc.edu/2004/07/531.html Emphasis on 'culture' in psychology fuels stereotypes, scholar says.]" University of California: Santa Cruz.&lt;/ref&gt; Gjerde argues that individuals develop multiple perspectives about their culture, sometimes act in accord with their culture without sharing the cultural beliefs, and sometimes outright oppose their culture. Stereotyping thus views individuals as homogeneous products of culture.&lt;ref name="wainryb"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wainryb | first1 = C | year = 2004 | title = The Study of Diversity in Human Development: Culture, Urgencies, and Perils | url = https://psych.utah.edu/people/files/wainryb83r13.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111110173541/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/files/wainryb83r13.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2011-11-10 | format = PDF | journal = Human Development | volume = 47 | issue =  | pages = 131–137 | doi = 10.1159/000077986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faulty methodology ===
Self-reporting data is one of the easiest and most accessible methods of mass data collection, especially in cultural psychology.&lt;ref name="masuda01" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kitayama | first1 = S. | display-authors = etal | year = 2002 | title = Culture and basic psychological processes—Toward a system view of culture: Comment on Oyserman et al | url = http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/n/x/nxy906/COMPS/indivdualismandcollectivism/culture%20lit/to%20print/Kitayama2002commentsonOyserman.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = 1| pages = 89–96 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.128.1.89 | pmid = 11843550 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, over-emphasizing cross-cultural comparisons of self-reported attitudes and values can lead to relatively unstable and ultimately misleading data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heine | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Lehman | first2 = D.R. | last3 = Peng | first3 = K. | last4 = Greenholtz | first4 = J. | year = 2002 | title = What's wrong with cross-cultural comparisons of subjective Likert scales: The reference-group problem | url = http://culcog.berkeley.edu/Publications/2002JPSP_referencegroup.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 82 | issue = 6| pages = 903–18 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.82.6.903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peng | first1 = K. | last2 = Nisbett | first2 = R.E. | last3 = Wong | first3 = N. | year = 1997 | title = Validity problems of cross-cultural value comparison and possible solutions | url = http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/92164/ValidityProblemsComparingValues.pdf?sequence=1 | journal = Psychological Methods | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 329–41 | doi = 10.1037/1082-989X.2.4.329 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Cultural psychologist, Richard Shweder argues that the psyche and culture are mutually constructed and inseparable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The failure of replicating many psychology findings in other regions of the world supported the idea that mind and environment are interdependent, and different throughout the world. Some criticisms state that using self-report may be a relatively unreliable method, and could be misleading especially in different cultural context. Regardless that self-report is an important way to obtain mass data, it is not the only way.

In fact, cultural psychologists utilized multiple measurements and resources no different from other scientific researches – observation, experiment, data analysis etc. For example, Nisbett &amp; Cohen (1996) investigated the relation between historical cultural background and regional aggression difference in the U.S.A. In this study, researchers designed laboratory experiment to observe participants' aggression, and crime rate, demographic statistics were analyzed. The experiment results supported the [[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|culture of honor]] theory that the aggression is a defense mechanism which is rooted in the herding cultural origin for most the southerners.&lt;ref name="nisbett96" /&gt; In laboratory observations, Heine and his colleagues found that Japanese students spend more time than American students on tasks that they did poorly on, and the finding presents a self-improvement motivation often seen in East Asian that failure and success is interconvertible with effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cultural psychology|last = Heine|first = Steven|publisher = W.

Quantitative statistics of cultural products revealed that public media in western countries promote more individualistic components than East-Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Measuring Culture Outside the Head: A Meta-Analysis of Individualism—Collectivism in Cultural Products|url = http://psr.sagepub.com/content/12/3/199|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review|date = 2008-08-01|issn = 1088-8683|pmid = 18544712|pages = 199–221|volume = 12|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/1088868308318260|first = Beth|last = Morling|first2 = Marika|last2 = Lamoreaux}}&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics are objective because it does not involve having people fill out questionnaire, instead, psychologists use physical measurements to quantitatively collect data about culture products, such as painting and photos. These statistics data can also be national records, for example, Chiao &amp; Blizinsky (2010) revealed that cultures of high collectivism is associated with lower prevalence of mood/anxiety disorders in study involving 29 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Culture–gene coevolution of individualism–collectivism and the serotonin transporter gene|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1681/529|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2010-02-22|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 2842692|pmid = 19864286|pages = 529–537|volume = 277|issue = 1681|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2009.1650|first = Joan Y.|last = Chiao|first2 = Katherine D.|last2 = Blizinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the experimental and statistics data, evidence from neuro-imaging studies, also help strengthen the reliability of cultural psychology research. For example, when thinking of mother, the brain region related to self-concept showed significant activation in Chinese, whereas no activation observed in Westerners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neural basis of cultural influence on self-representation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811906009189|journal = NeuroImage|date = 2007-02-01|pages = 1310–1316|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.08.047|first = Ying|last = Zhu|first2 = Li|last2 = Zhang|first3 = Jin|last3 = Fan|first4 = Shihui|last4 = Han|pmid=17134915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural models ==

"One way we organize and understand our social world is through the use of cultural models or culturally shaped mental maps. These consist of culturally derived ideas and practices that are embodied, enacted, or instituted in everyday life." Cultural psychologists develop models to categorize cultural phenomena.&lt;ref name="Fryberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fryberg | first1 = S.A. | last2 = Markus | first2 = H.R. | year = 2007 | title = Cultural models of education in American Indian, Asian America, and European American contexts | url = | journal = Social Psychology of Education | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 1381–2890 | doi = 10.1007/s11218-007-9017-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 4 I's culture cycle ===

The 4 I's cultural model was developed by [[Hazel Rose Markus]] and Alana Conner in their book ''Clash! 8 Cultural Conflicts That Make Us Who We Are.'' In it, they refer to the mutually constitutive nature of culture and individual as a "culture cycle." The culture cycle consists of four layers (Individuals, Interactions, Institutions, Ideas) of cultural influence that help to explain the interaction between self and culture.&lt;ref name="Markus"&gt;Markus, H. R., &amp; Conner, A. C. (2013). Clash! Eight Cultural Conflicts that Make Us Who We Are. New York: Penguin (Hudson Street Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Individuals ====
The first "I" concerns how an individual thinks about and expresses itself. Studies show that in the United States, individuals are more likely think of him or herself as "independent", "equal", and "individualistic". Individuals have characteristics that are consistent across time and situation.  When asked to describe themselves, Americans are likely to use adjectives to describe their personalities, such as "energetic", "friendly", or "hard-working". In Japan, studies show that individuals are more likely to think of themselves as "obligated to society", "interdependent", and "considerate". The self is adaptable to the situation. Japanese individuals are therefore more likely to describe themselves in relation to others, such as "I try not to upset anyone," or "I am a father, a son, and a brother."&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;Heine, S. (2011). Cultural Psychology. San Francisco: W. W. Norton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Interactions ====
Interactions with other people and products reinforce cultural behaviors on a daily basis. Stories, songs, architecture, and advertisements are all methods of interaction that guide individuals in a culture to promote certain values and teach them how to behave.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; For example, in Japan, no-smoking signs emphasize the impact that smoke has on others by illustrating the path of smoke as it affects surrounding people. In the US, no-smoking signs focus on individual action by simply saying "No Smoking".  These signs reflect underlying cultural norms and values, and when people see them they are encouraged to behave in accordance with the greater cultural values.

==== Institutions ====
The next layer of culture is made up of the institutions in which everyday interactions take place. These determine and enforce the rules for a society and include legal, government, economic, scientific, philosophical, and religious bodies. Institutions encourage certain practices and products while discouraging others. In Japanese kindergartens, children learn about important cultural values such as teamwork, group harmony, and cooperation. During "birthday month celebration," for example, the class celebrates all the children who have birthdays that month. This institutional practice underscores the importance of a group over an individual. In US kindergartens, children learn their personal value when they celebrate their birthdays one by one, enforcing the cultural value of uniqueness and individualism. Everyday institutional practices such as classroom birthday celebrations propagate prominent cultural themes.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

=== Whiting model ===
John and Beatrice Whiting, along with their research students at [[Harvard University]], developed the "Whiting model" for child development during the 1970s and 1980s, which specifically focused on how culture influences development.&lt;ref name="Worthman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Worthman | first1 = C. M. | year = 2010 | title = The Ecology of Human Development: Evolving Models for Cultural Psychology | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 546–562 | doi = 10.1177/0022022110362627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whitings coined the term "cultural learning environment", to describe the surroundings that influence a child during development.&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;Edwards, Carolyn P. and Bloch, M. (2010). "[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1500&amp;context=psychfacpub The Whitings' Concepts of Culture and How They Have Fared in Contemporary Psychology and Anthropology]." Faculty Publications, Department of Psychology.Paper 501.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beatrice Whiting defined a child's environmental contexts as being "characterized by an activity in progress, a physically defined space, a characteristic group of people, and norms of behavior".&lt;ref name="edwards" /&gt; This environment is composed of several layers. A child's geographical context influences the history/anthropology of their greater community. This results in maintenance systems (i.e., sociological characteristics) that form a cultural learning environment. These factors inform learned behavior, or progressive expressive systems that take the form of religion, magic beliefs, ritual and ceremony, art, recreation, games and play, or crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Berry, Ype H. Poortinga, Marshall H. Segall, Pierre R. Dasen, Cambridge University Press, 1992, Cross-Cultural Psychology: Research and Applications: Second Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Many researchers have expanded upon the Whiting model,&lt;ref name="Worthman" /&gt; and the Whiting model's influence is clear in both modern psychology and anthropology. According to an article by Thomas Weisner in the ''[[Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology]]'', "All these [more recent] approaches share a common intellectual project: to take culture and context deeply and seriously into account in studies of human development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisner | first1 = T.S. | year = 2010 | title = John and Beatrice Whiting's Contributions to the Cross-Cultural Study of Human Development: Their Values, Goals, Norms, and Practices | url = http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/41/4/499.full.pdf+html | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 499–509 | doi = 10.1177/0022022110362720 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and motivation ==

=== Self-enhancement vs. self-improvement ===
While self-enhancement is a person's motivation to view themselves positively, self-improvement is a person's motivation to have others view themselves positively. The distinction between the two modes of life is most evident between independent and collectivistic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heine|first=Steven|date=1999|title=Is there a universal need for positive self-regard?|url=|journal=2017 American Psychological Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultures with independent self-views (the premise that people see themselves as self-contained entities) often emphasize self-esteem, confidence in one's own worth and abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2007/06/07/high-self-esteem-may-be-culturally-universal-international-study-shows/|title=High self-esteem may be culturally universal, international study shows|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With self-esteem seen as a main source of happiness in Western cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Hyunji|date=February 2016|title=The Role of Positive Self-Evaluation on Cross-Cultural Differences in Well-Being|url=|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the motivation to self-enhance generally follows as a way to maintain one's positive view about oneself. Some strategies employed when self-enhancing often include [[Social comparison theory|downward social comparison]], compensatory self-enhancement, discounting, [[Attribution (psychology)|external attributions]] and [[basking in reflected glory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Psychology|last=Heine|first=Steven|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, collectivistic cultures often emphasize self-improvement as a leading motivating factor in their lives. This motivation is often derived from a desire to not lose face and to appear positively among social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heine |first1=Steven J. |last2=Raineri |first2=Andres |title=Self-Improving Motivations and Collectivism |journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |date=January 2009 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=158–163 |doi=10.1177/0022022108326193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and empathy ==

=== Cultural orientation: collectivistic and individualistic ===
A main distinction to understand when looking at psychology and culture is the difference between [[Individualism|individualistic]] and [[Collectivism|collectivistic]] cultures. People from an individualistic culture typically demonstrate an independent view of the self; the focus is usually on personal achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prooijen|first1=J.|title=Individualistic and social motives for justice judgments|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=2013|volume=1299|issue=1|pages=60–67|doi=10.1111/nyas.12143|pmid=25708080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of a collectivistic society have more of a focus on the group (interdependent view of self), usually focusing on things that will benefit the group.&lt;ref name="Hui (1988)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hui|first1=C.H.|title=Measurement of individualism-collectivism|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|date=1988|volume=22|issue=1|pages=17–36|doi=10.1016/0092-6566(88)90022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown such differences of the self when comparing collectivistic and individualistic cultures: The [[Fundamental attribution error|Fundamental Attribution Error]] has been shown to be more common in America (individualistic) as compared to in India (collectivistic).&lt;ref name="Ross (1977)"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ross|authorlink1=L.|editor1-last=Berkowitz|editor1-first=L.|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|date=1977|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|edition=4th|chapter=The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along these same lines, the [[self-serving bias]] was again shown as more common among Americans than Japanese individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kashima|first1=Y.|authorlink2=Harry C. Triandis|last2=Triandis|first2=H.C.|title=The self-serving bias in attributions as a coping strategy: A cross-cultural study|journal=Journal of Cross-cultural Psychology|date=1986|volume=17|issue=1|pages=83–97|doi=10.1177/0022002186017001006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in a study involving an animation of fish, wherein Western viewers interpreted the scene of a fish swimming away from a school as an expression of individualism and independence, while Eastern individuals wondered what was wrong with the singular fish and concluded that the school had kicked it out.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.learner.org/resources/transcripts/DiscoveringPsychology/26CulPsych.pdf|title=Discovering Psychology: Cultural Psychology|last=Zimbardo|first=Philip|date=|website=Learner.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study showed that in coverage of the same instance of violent crime, Western news focused on innate character flaws and the failings of the individual while Chinese news pointed out the lack of relationships of the perpetrator in a foreign environment and the failings of society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is not to imply that collectivism and individualism are completely dichotomous, but these two cultural orientations are to be understood more so as a spectrum. Each representation is at either end; thus, some members of individualistic cultures may hold collectivistic values, and some collectivistic individual may hold some individualist values. The concepts of collectivism and individualism show a general idea of the values of a specific ethnic culture but should not be juxtaposed in competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hofstede|first1=G.|title=Culture's consequences: International differences in work-related values|date=1980|publisher=Sage|location=Beverly Hills, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Empathy across cultures ===
These differences in values across cultures suggests that understanding and expressing empathy may be manifested differently throughout varying cultures. Duan and Hill&lt;ref name="Duan &amp; Hill (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=C.|last2=Hill|first2=C.E.|title=The current state of empathy research|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=1996|volume=43|issue=3|pages=261–74|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.43.3.261}}&lt;/ref&gt; first discussed empathy in subcategories of intellectual empathy: taking on someone's thoughts/perspective, also known as cognitive empathy&lt;ref name="Soto &amp; Levenson (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soto|first1=J.A.|last2=Levenson|first2=R.W.|title=Emotion recognition across culture: The influence of ethnicity on empathic accuracy and physiological linkage|journal=Emotion|date=2009|volume=9|issue=6|doi=10.1037/a0017399|pages=874–884|pmc=2877627}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emotional empathy:  taking on someone's feeling/experience. Duan, Wei, and Wang&lt;ref name="Duan, Wei, &amp; Wang (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=C.|last2=Wei|first2=M.|last3=Wang|first3=L.|title=The role of individualism-collectivism|journal=Asian Journal of Counseling|date=2008|volume=29|issue=3|pages=57–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; furthered this idea to include empathy in terms of being either dispositional (capacity for noticing/understanding empathy) or experiential (specific to a certain context or situation, observing the person and empathizing). This created four types of empathy to further examine: 1) dispositional intellectual empathy; 2) dispositional empathic emotion; 3) experienced intellectual empathy; and 4) experienced empathic emotion. These four branches allowed researchers to examine empathic proclivities among individuals of different cultures. While individualism was not shown to correlate with either types of dispositional empathy, collectivism was shown to have a direct correlation with both types of dispositional empathy, possibly suggesting that by having less focus on the self, there is more capacity towards noticing the needs of others. More so, individualism predicted experienced intellectual empathy, and collectivism predicted experienced empathic emotion. These results are congruent with the values of collectivistic and individualistic societies. The self-centered identity and egoistic motives prevalent in individualistic cultures, perhaps acts as a hindrance in being open to (fully) experiencing empathy.&lt;ref name="Kitayama &amp; Markus (1994)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kitayama|first1=S.|last2=Markus|first2=H.R.|title=Emotion and culture: Empirical studies of mutual influence|date=1994|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intercultural and ethnocultural empathy ===
Cultural empathy became broadly understood as concurrent understanding and acceptance of a culture different from one's own.&lt;ref name="Ridley &amp; Lingle (1996)"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ridely, C.R.|author2=Lingle, D.W.|editor1-last=Pedersen|editor1-first=P.B.|editor2-last=Draguns|editor2-first=J.G.|title=Counseling Across Culture|date=1996|publisher=Sage|location=Thousands Oaks: CA|chapter=Cultural empathy in multicultural counseling: A multidimensional process model.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea has been further developed with the concept of [[ethnocultural empathy]].&lt;ref name="Wang et al. (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Y.W.|last2=Blier|first2=J.|last3=Davidson|first3=M.|last4=Savoy|first4=H.|last5=Tan|first5=J.|last6=Tan|first6=J.|last7=Yakushka|first7=O.|title=The scale of ethnocultural empathy: Development, validation, and reliability|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=2003|volume=2|pages=221–234|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.50.2.221}}&lt;/ref&gt; This moves beyond merely accepting and understanding another culture, and also includes acknowledging how the values of a culture may affect empathy. This idea is meant to foster cultural empathy as well as engender cultural competence.&lt;ref name="Wang et al. (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyche &amp; Zayas (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dyche|first1=L.|last2=Zayas|first2=L.H.|title=Cross-cultural empathy and training the contemporary psychotherapist|journal=Clinical Social Work Journal|date=2001|volume=29|issue=3|pages=245–258|doi=10.1023/A:1010407728614}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the greatest barriers of empathy between cultures is people's tendency to operate from an ethnocentric point of view. Eysneck&lt;ref name="Eysenck (2000)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eysenck|first1=M.|title=Psychology: A student's handbook|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press LTD}}&lt;/ref&gt; conceptualized ethnocentrism as using one's own culture to understand the rest of the world, while holding one's own values as correct. Concomitant with this barrier to intercultural empathy, Rasoal, Eklund, and Hansen&lt;ref name="Raosal, Eklund, &amp; Hansen (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raosal|first1=C.|last2=Eklund|first2=J.|last3=Hansen|first3=E.M.|title=Toward a conceptualization of ethnocultural empathy|journal=Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology|date=2011|volume=5|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1037/h0099278}}&lt;/ref&gt; posit five hindrances of intercultural empathy; these include:

Paucity of:
* (general) knowledge outside one's own culture
* (general) experience with other cultures outside one's own
* (specific) knowledge regarding other people's cultures
* (specific) experiences regarding other people's cultures

and:
* inability to bridge different cultures by understanding the commonalities and dissimilarities

These five points elucidate lack of both depth and breadth as hindrances in developing and practicing intercultural empathy.

Another barrier to intercultural empathy is that there is often a power dynamic between different cultures. Bridging an oppressed culture with their (upper-echelon) oppressor is a goal of intercultural empathy.  One approach to this barrier is to attempt to acknowledge one's personal oppression.&lt;ref name="DeTurk (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeTurk|first1=S.|title=Intercultural empathy: Myth, competency, or possibility for alliance building?|journal=Communication Building|date=2001|volume=50|issue=4|pages=374–384|doi=10.1080/03634520109379262}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this may be minimal in comparison to other people's oppression, it will still help with realizing that other people have been oppressed.&lt;ref name="DeTurk (2001)" /&gt; The goal of bridging the gap should focus on building an alliance by finding the core commonalities of the human experience; this shows empathy to be a relational experience, not an independent one. Through this, the goal is that intercultural empathy can lend toward broader intercultural understanding across cultures and societies.

Four important facets of cultural empathy are:&lt;ref name="Wang et al. (2003)" /&gt;
* Taking the perspective of someone from a different culture
* Understanding the verbal/behavioral expression that occurs during ethnocultural empathy
* Being cognizant of how different cultures are treated by larger entities such as the job market and the media
* Accepting differences in cultural choices regarding language, clothing preference, food choice, etc.

These four aspects may be especially helpful for practicing cultural competence in a clinical setting. Given that most psychological practices were founded on the parochial ideals of Euro-American psychologists, cultural competence was not considered much of a necessity until said psychologists increasingly began seeing clients with different ethnic backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Dyche &amp; Zayas (2001)" /&gt; Many of the problems that contribute to therapy not being beneficial for people of color include: therapy having an individual focus, an emphasis on expressiveness, and an emphasis on openness.&lt;ref name="Sue &amp; Sue (1977)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sue|first1=D.W.|last2=Sue|first2=D.|title=Barriers to effective cross-cultural counseling|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=1977|volume=24|issue=5|pages=420–429|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.24.5.420}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more on intercultural competence, see [[intercultural competence]].

'''Curriculum studies''' ('''CS''') is a concentration within curriculum and instruction concerned with understanding [[curriculum|curricula]] as an active force of human educational experience.

==Overview==
Specific questions related to curriculum studies include the following: 
*What should be taught in [[school]]s? 
*Why should it be taught? To whom should it be taught? 
*What does it mean to be an educated person?

Components of CS also investigate the relationship between [[curriculum theory]] and educational practice and the relationship between school programs and the contours of the [[society]] and [[culture]] in which schools are located. There are [[#University programs|programs in the field of curriculum studies]] in several Colleges of Education around the world. Curriculum studies was also the first subdivision of the [[American Educational Research Association]], known as Division B.

Important CS books include ''The Curriculum: Perspective, Paradigm, and Possibility'' by William Schubert (New York: Macmillan, 1986; and ''Understanding Curriculum'' by [[William Pinar]], et al. (New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 1995).

Curriculum studies emerged as a distinctive field in the late 1960s and early 1970s from educationists focused on curriculum development. The shift from developing and evaluating curriculum to understanding curriculum is known as the "Reconceptualization" of the curriculum field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pacheco|first1=Jose, Augusto|title=Curriculum studies: What is the field today?|journal=Journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Curriculum Studies|date=2012|volume=8|pages=18|url=https://www.uwstout.edu/soe/jaaacs/upload/v8_What_Is_The_Field_Today.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A branch of curriculum studies that investigates how society transmits culture from generation to generation has been tagged with the term "[[hidden curriculum]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Mark, K|title=Curriculum theory and practice|url=http://infed.org/mobi/curriculum-theory-and-practice/|website=infed.org|publisher=The Encyclopaedia of Informal Education|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though much of what is studied is hiding in plain sight.  For instance, one of the 19th century founders of the discipline of [[sociology]], [[Émile Durkheim]], observed that more is taught and learned in schools than specified in the established curriculum of textbooks and teacher manuals.  In ''Moral Education'' Durkheim wrote:

:"In fact, there is a whole system of rules in the school that predetermine the child's conduct.  He must come to class regularly, he must arrive at a specified time and with an appropriate bearing and attitude.  He must not disrupt things in class.  He must have learned his lessons, done his homework, and have done so reasonably well, etc.  There are, therefore, a host of obligations that the child is required to shoulder.  Together they constitute the discipline of the school.  It is through the practice of school discipline that we can inculcate the spirit of discipline in the child. (Durkheim, Émile (1961 [1925]). ''Moral Education''. New York, The Free Press.p.&amp;nbsp;148)"

[[Phillip W. Jackson]] (1968) may have coined the term "hidden curriculum" in his book ''Life in Classrooms''.  He argued that [[primary school]] emphasized specific skills: learning to wait quietly, exercising restraint, trying, completing work, keeping busy, cooperating, showing allegiance to both teachers and peers, being neat and punctual, and so on (Jackson, Philip (1968). ''Life in Classrooms''.). The [[Structural functionalism|structural functional]] sociologist [[Robert Dreeben]] (1968 ''On What is Learned in School'') similarly concluded that the curriculum of schooling taught students to "form transient social relationships, submerge much of their personal identity, and accept the legitimacy of categorical treatment".  Dreeben argued that formal schooling indirectly conveyed to students values such as independence and achievement, essential for their later membership in society. 
 
Since then, curriculum studies researchers ranging across the spectrum of paradigms&amp;mdash;from conservative structural-[[Structural functionalism|functionalists]], to neo-[[Marxist]]s to narrative- and arts-based researchers&amp;mdash;have examined formal curricula, experienced curricula, and hidden curricula.  Progressive researchers like Paul Willis (1977, ''Learning to Labor: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''), Jean Anyon  (1980, "Social Class and the Hidden Curriculum of Work". ''Journal of Education'' 162), and [[Annette Lareau]] (1989. ''Home Advantage: Social Class, and Parental Intervention in Elementary Education'') have examined the ways that hidden and overt curricula reproduce [[social class]] position.  Narrative and arts-based researchers like Thomas Barone (2001, ''Touching Eternity: The Enduring Outcomes of Teaching'') have inquired about the long-term effects of curricula on student lives.

Critical theorists like [[Henry Giroux]] (1983 "Theories of Reproduction and Resistance in the New Sociology of Education: A critical analysis." ''Harvard Educational Review'' 53) began to examine the roles of students and teachers in resisting curricula both official and hidden.  So-called "resistance theorists" conceptualized students and teachers as active agents working to subvert, reject, or change curricula.  They noted that "curriculum" was not a unified structure but incoherent conflicting and contradictory messages. Other researchers have examined the interactions between racial and [[ethnic]] cultures and the dominant curricula of the school. For instance the anthropologist John Ogbu examined curricula established by [[African American]] students ([[Signithia Fordham]] and John Ogbu 1986 "Black Students' School Success: Coping with the Burden of 'Acting White.' ''The Urban Review'' 18).   [[Critical race theory|Critical race theorists]] like Daniel Solórzano examined how racial attitudes constitute another "hidden" curriculum in teacher education programs (1997, Images and Words that Wound: Critical Race Theory and Racial Stereotyping, and Teacher Education, ''Teacher Education Quarterly'', 24). Additionally, Judith Stacey proposed in the 1960s schools conveyed a hidden curriculum that perpetuated the "sexist beliefs, attitudes, and values" of the time period (1974 "And Jill Came Tumbling After Sexism in American Education").&lt;ref&gt;Stacey, Judith, et al. (eds.) (1974). And Jill Came Tumbling After: Sexism in American Education. New York: Dell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interest in curriculum studies is thus cross disciplinary and of increasing importance to [[educational research]] and to the [[philosophy of education]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8696">'''Deuterium fusion''', also called '''deuterium burning''', is a [[nuclear fusion]] reaction that occurs in stars and some [[substellar object]]s, in which a [[deuterium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] and a [[proton]] combine to form a [[helium-3]] nucleus. It occurs as the second stage of the [[proton–proton chain reaction]], in which a deuterium nucleus formed from two [[proton]]s fuses with another proton, but can also proceed from [[big bang nucleosynthesis|primordial]] deuterium.

==In protostars==
Deuterium is the most easily fused nucleus available to accreting [[protostar]]s,&lt;ref name="ZuckermanMalkan"&gt;{{Cite book

If there was no deuterium fusion, there would be no stars with masses more than about two or three times the mass of the [[Sun]] in the pre-[[main-sequence]] phase as the more intense [[Stellar nucleosynthesis#Hydrogen fusion|hydrogen fusion]] would occur and prevent the object from accreting matter.&lt;ref name="Palla"/&gt; Deuterium fusion allows further accretion of mass by acting as a thermostat that temporarily stops the central temperature from rising above about one million degrees, a temperature not hot enough for hydrogen fusion, but allowing time for the accumulation of more mass.&lt;ref name="BallyReipurth"&gt;{{Cite book

  | isbn = 9780521801058}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the energy transport mechanism switches from convective to radiative, energy transport slows, allowing the temperature to rise and hydrogen fusion take over in a stable and sustained way. Hydrogen fusion will begin at {{val|e=7|u=K}}.

The rate of energy generation is proportional to (deuterium concentration)×(density)×(temperature)&lt;sup&gt;11.8&lt;/sup&gt;. If the core is in a stable state, the energy generation will be constant. If one variable in the equation increases, the other two must decrease to keep energy generation constant. As the temperature is raised to the power of 11.8, it would require very large changes in either the deuterium concentration or its density to result in even a small change in temperature.&lt;ref name="Palla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BallyReipurth"/&gt; The deuterium concentration reflects the fact that the gasses are a mixture of ordinary hydrogen and helium and deuterium.

The mass surrounding the radiative zone is still rich in deuterium, and deuterium fusion proceeds in an increasingly thin shell that gradually moves outwards as the radiative core of the star grows. The generation of nuclear energy in these low-[[density]] outer regions causes the protostar to swell, delaying the gravitational contraction of the object and postponing its arrival on the main sequence.&lt;ref name="Palla"/&gt; The total energy available by deuterium fusion is comparable to that released by gravitational contraction.&lt;ref name="BallyReipurth"/&gt;

Due to the scarcity of deuterium in the [[Universe]], a protostar's supply of it is limited. After a few million years, it will have effectively been completely consumed.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{Cite book

==In substellar objects==

[[Stellar nucleosynthesis#Hydrogen fusion|Hydrogen fusion]] requires much higher temperatures and pressures than does deuterium fusion, hence, there are objects massive enough to burn deuterium but not massive enough to burn hydrogen.

Objects above the deuterium-fusion minimum mass (deuterium burning minimum mass, DBMM) will fuse all their deuterium in a very short time (∼4–50 Myr), whereas objects below that will burn little, and hence, preserve their original deuterium abundance. "The apparent identification of free-floating objects, or [[rogue planet]]s below the DBMM would suggest that the formation of star-like objects extends below the DBMM."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Deuterium Burning in Substellar Objects|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/542/2/L119/fulltext/005577.text.html|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=542|issue=2|pages=L119|accessdate=2 January 2015|bibcode=2000ApJ...542L.119C|last1=Chabrier|first1=G.|last2=Baraffe|first2=I.|last3=Allard|first3=F.|last4=Hauschildt|first4=P.|year=2000|doi=10.1086/312941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In planets==
It has been shown that deuterium fusion should also be possible in planets. The mass threshold for the onset of deuterium fusion atop the solid cores is also at roughly 13 Jupiter masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mollière|first1=P.|last2=Mordasini|first2=C.|title=Deuterium burning in objects forming via the core accretion scenario|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|date=7 November 2012|volume=547|pages=A105|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201219844|arxiv = 1210.0538 |bibcode = 2012A&amp;A...547A.105M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bodenheimer|first1=Peter|last2=D'Angelo|first2=Gennaro|last3=Lissauer|first3=Jack J.|last4=Fortney|first4=Jonathan J.|last5=Saumon|first5=Didier|title=Deuterium Burning in Massive Giant Planets and Low-mass Brown Dwarfs Formed by Core-nucleated Accretion|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=20 June 2013|volume=770|issue=2|pages=120|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/770/2/120|arxiv = 1305.0980 |bibcode = 2013ApJ...770..120B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other reactions==

Though fusion with a proton is the dominant method of consuming deuterium, other reactions are possible. These include fusion with another deuterium nucleus to form [[helium-3]], [[tritium]], or (more rarely) [[helium-4]], or with helium to form various [[isotopes of lithium|isotopes]] of [[lithium]].&lt;ref name="RolfsRodney"&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2331">'''Dynamical genetics''' concerns the study and the interpretation of those phenomena in which physiological [[Enzyme|enzymatic]] [[protein complex]]es alter the [[DNA]], in a more or less sophisticated way.

The study of such mechanisms is important firstly since they promote useful functions, as for example the [[V(D)J recombination|immune system recombination]] (on [[Ontogeny|individual scale]]) and the [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing-over]] (on [[Evolution|evolutionary scale]]); secondly since they may sometimes become harmful because of some malfunctioning, causing for example [[Neurodegenerative disease|neurodegenerative disorders]].

Typical examples of dynamical genetics subjects are:
*[[The Sherman paradox|dynamic mutations]], term introduced by Robert I. Richards and Grant R. Sutherland&lt;ref name="pmid9397685"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Richards RI, Sutherland GR |title=Dynamic mutation: possible mechanisms and significance in human disease |journal=Trends Biochem. Sci. |volume=22 |issue=11 |pages=432–6 |year=1997 |pmid=9397685 |doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(97)01108-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; to indicate [[mutation]]s caused by other mutations; this phenomenon often involves the [[Variable number tandem repeats|Variable Number Tandem Repeats]], closely related to many [[neurodegenerative disease]]s, as the [[trinucleotide repeat disorders]] (interpreted by [[Anita Harding]]).
*dynamic genome, term introduced by [[Nina Fedoroff]] and David Botstein to indicate the [[Transposon|transposition]] discovered by [[Barbara McClintock]].
*[[V(D)J recombination|immune V(D)J recombination]] (discovered by [[Tonegawa Susumu|Susumu Tonegawa]]) and [[Antibody#Class switching|isotype class switching]], terms introduced to indicate two kinds of immune system recombinations, which are the main cause of the enormous variety of antibodies.
*[[horizontal DNA transfer]] (discovered by [[Frederick Griffith]]) that indicates the DNA transfer between two organisms.
*[[Chromosomal crossover|crossing-over]] (discovered by [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]) mediated by formation and unwinding (by means of peculiar enzymatic complexes such as  [[helicase]]) of uncommon four-helix DNA structures known as [[G-quadruplex]]es (discovered by Martin Gellert, Marie N. Lipsett, and David R. Davies).

Born June 20, 1929 in [[Cluj]], [[Romania]], she is a [[Holocaust survivor]], art professor, and [[historian]]. She is married to mathematician [[Egon Balas]], also a retired professor at Carnegie Mellon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holocaustcenterpgh.org/exhibitions/in-celebration-of-life-living-legacy-project/edith-balas/|title=Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh » Edith Balas|website=holocaustcenterpgh.org|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balas' main areas of interest are [[modern art]] (1890-1960), painting and sculpture, and the art of the Italian Renaissance.&lt;ref name="Beck review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beck|first1=James|title=Review: Michelangelo's Medici Chapel: A New Interpretation.

She has been teaching at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] since 1977, and is also an Adjunct Professor of History of Art and Architecture at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].

Edith Balas is also a Holocaust survivor, having been sent to the Nazi death camp [[Auschwitz]].  In ''Bird in Flight: Memoir of a Survivor and Scholar,''  Balas tells her story of facing grim situations and becoming what she describes as a “professional survivor.”  Balas named her memoir “Bird in Flight” after [[Constantin Brâncuși]]’s famous sculpture of the same name. “I consider it emblematic of my life,” she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2011/March/march22_edithbalasmemoir.shtml|title=March 22: CMU's Edith Balas Pens Memoir Depicting Life as a Survivor and Scholar - Carnegie Mellon University - CMU|first=Carnegie Mellon University|last=(CMU)|website=www.cmu.edu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war her husband was imprisoned by the [[Communist Romania|communist authorities]] for three years, during which Balas raised their two daughters. She received an M.A. in Philosophy from the [[University of Bucharest]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmu.edu/cas/people/balas_edith.html|title=Edith Balas - Center for the Arts in Society - Carnegie Mellon University|first=Carnegie Mellon|last=University|website=www.cmu.edu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then emigrated to the United States with her husband, and received an M.A. in the History of Arts from Pittsburgh University in 1970 and a Ph.D. in 1973.

'''Engineering studies''' is an interdisciplinary branch of social sciences and humanities devoted to the study of engineers and their activities, often considered a part of [[Science and Technology Studies|science and technology studies (STS)]], and intersecting with and drawing from [[engineering education research]]. Studying engineers refers among other to the history and the sociology of their profession, its institutionalization and organization, the social composition and structure of the population of engineers, their training, their trajectory, etc. A subfield is for instance [[Women in engineering]]. Studying engineering refers to the study of engineering activities and practices, their knowledge and ontologies, their role into the society, their engagement.

Engineering studies investigates how social, political, economical, cultural and historical dynamics affect technological research, design, engineering and innovation, and how these, in turn, affect society, economics, politics and culture.

'''Etioplasts''' are [[chloroplast]]s that have not been exposed to light. They are usually found in [[flowering plants]] (Angiosperms) grown in the dark. If a plant is kept out of light for several days, its normal chloroplasts will actually convert into etioplasts. Etioplasts lack active pigment and can technically be considered [[leucoplast]]s. High concentrations of etioplasts will cause leaves to appear yellow rather than green.&lt;ref name=wise&gt;{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Robert|title=The Diversity of Plastid Form and Function|publisher=Springer|date=2007|chapter=1|url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/qp032630631337u6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These plant [[organelle]]s contain prolamellar bodies, which are membrane aggregations of semi-crystalline lattices of branched tubules that carry the precursor pigment for [[chlorophyll]]. The prolamellar bodies are often (and presumed always) arranged in geometric patterns.&lt;ref name="wise" /&gt;

They are converted to chloroplasts via the stimulation of chlorophyll synthesis by the plant hormone [[cytokinin]] soon after exposure to light. [[Thylakoid]]s and [[Thylakoid|grana]] arise from the prolamellar bodies during this process.

'''European studies''' is a field of study offered by many academic [[college]]s and [[university|universities]] that focuses on current developments in [[European integration]].

Some programmes offer a social science or public administration curriculum focusing on developments in the European Union. These programmes usually include a combination of political science, EU public policy, [[European history]], [[European law]], [[economics]] and [[sociology]]. Other universities approach the subject in a broader manner, including topics like [[European culture]], [[European literature]] and [[European languages]]. While all programmes focus on the study of the European Union, they often cover national topics (in a comparative perspective) as well.

The subject combines [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. Disciplines that are involved in European studies include:

While European studies departments are obviously more common in Europe than elsewhere, there are departments dedicated to its study further afield, including in [[North America]], [[Asia]] and [[Australasia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1376">The '''First Things First''' manifesto was written 29 November 1963 and published in 1964 by [[Ken Garland]]. It was backed by over 400 graphic designers and artists and also received the backing of [[Tony Benn]], radical left-wing MP and activist, who published it in its entirety in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper.

Reacting against a rich and affluent Britain of the 1960s, it tried to re-radicalise a design industry which the signatories felt had become lazy and uncritical. Drawing on ideas shared by [[critical theory]], the [[Frankfurt School]] and the counter-culture of the time it explicitly reaffirmed the belief that design is not a neutral, value-free process.

It rallied against the consumerist culture that was purely concerned with buying and selling things and tried to highlight a [[Humanism|Humanist]] dimension to graphic design theory. It was later updated and republished with a new group of signatories as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6639">'''Flour extraction''' is the common process of refining Whole Grain Flour first milled from [[Grain|grain]] or [[Grist|grist]] by running it through sifting devices.

== Definition ==
For centuries, much of the flour milled for human consumption has been run through some kind of “bolting”, sifting or “extraction” process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hazen |first1=Theodore |title=Flour Bolting (Sifting) and Bolting Cloth |url=http://www.angelfire.com/journal/millbuilder/boulting.html |website=Mill Builder |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This flour is extracted from whole grains for one of two reasons; firstly, to decrease the [[Roller Milled White Enriched Flour|tendency for rancidity]]. The milling systems with a lower extraction percentage discard most of the rancidity prone nutritional minerals and oils associated with the [[bran]] and germ elements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Wheat Germ |url=http://kretschmer.com/about-wheatgerm |website=Kretschmer Wheat Germ |publisher=Kretschmer |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the wheat kernel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wheat Kernel |url=http://www.conejobread.com/wheat_kernel.htm |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Baking functionality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sakhare |first1=Suresh |last2=Ubandar |first2=Aashitosh |last3=Indrani |first3=Soumya |last4=Rao |first4=G.

Like the lower extraction white flour, higher extraction flour still creates a smoother dough more inclined to hold the gas created during fermentation. However, higher extraction flour also retains the sensory flavors and nutrition associated with the smaller bran and germ elements that are also extracted along with the endosperm.

== History ==
“White flour”, extracted from whole grains by [[Roller Milled White Enriched Flour|Roller mills]] that eliminates the rancidity prone bran and germ elements of the wheat kernel was introduced in the late 19th century. By first hydrating the outer wheat kernel bran and germ elements to keep them intact, this new system then employed steel rollers instead of circulating stones to repetitively fracture the remaining starchy endosperm element into fine particles. The extracted endosperm flour came to be known as “white flour” as this element of the wheat kernel is white. This system ingeniously accomplished the extraction of most of the starchy endosperm while separating out virtually all of the bran and germ elements, extracting about 72% of the whole grain kernel. Roller milling eventually came (and continues) to dominate the world’s flour production. Well over 90% of U.S. flour production in 2017 was roller milled white enriched flour.   

Once roller milling made white flour affordable for almost everyone, public health issues arose.  As scientists learned more about the crucial health contributions of the bran and the germ, [[Enriched flour|artificial enrichment]] of white flour was introduced that restores a small part of the nutrition lost by eliminating all the bran and germ elements.

==Benefits==
There are generally two benefits from extraction:
#The highest extraction typically retains over 85% of the original volume by focusing on just improving functionality (increased loaf volume) without a significant sensory loss. A fine Whole Grain Flour is used to just remove the larger flour particles and is commonly referred to by Artisan bakers as High Extraction flour. It is primarily used to produce a variety of non-whole grain [[Bread|bread]] products.
#More aggressive sifting focuses on both functionality and reduction of the potential for rancidity by eliminating 100% of the bran and germ in the kernel.  This lower extraction (typically 72% or less) is most commonly [[Roller Milled White Enriched Flour|Roller Milled White Enriched flour]] yielding a significant selection of flour types used for a variety of baking applications, the most significant of which is [[white bread]].&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, David, ''Britain's War Machine: Weapons, Resources, and Experts in the Second World War'', p. 179, Oxford University Press, 2011 {{ISBN|9780199832675}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Higher extraction flour ==
The general availability of refrigeration and even flour itself, has diminished the significance of the rancidity/shelf life/keeping quality issue of whole grain flour.   Higher extraction rates just focus on the elimination of the larger flour particles to increase loaf volume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mangold |first1=Scott |title=Extraction Flour Bench Test Results |url=https://unifinemill.com/news/item/extraction-flour-bench-test-results |website=Unifine Flour Mill |publisher=Unifine Mill |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while retaining the majority of the nutritional bran and germ elements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Addendum to the Scott Mangold May 2015 Extraction Flour Baking Bench Test Comparative Flour Lab Analysis |url=https://unifinemill.com/news/item/comparative-flour-lab-analysis |website=Unifine Flour Mill |publisher=Unifine Mill |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the endosperm.  This is accomplished by direct extraction of the fine whole grain flour output of [[Impact mill|impact or attrition mills]].  Millers have been able to match the finer particle size distribution of low extraction roller milled white flour (72% extraction) that eliminated all the bran and germ elements with a higher +88% extraction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mangold |first1=Scott |title=Extraction Flour Bench Test Results |url=https://unifinemill.com/news/item/extraction-flour-bench-test-results |website=Unifine Flour Mill |publisher=Unifine Mill |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that retains most of them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6565">A '''functional response''' in [[ecology]] is the intake rate of a [[heterotroph|consumer]] as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of [[food density]] (the amount of food available in a given [[ecotope]]). It is associated with the [[numerical response]], which is the [[reproduction]] rate of a consumer as a function of food density. Following [[C. S. Holling]], functional responses are generally classified into three types, which are called Holling's type I, II, and III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last1=Holling |first1=C. S. |title=The components of [[predation]] as revealed by a study of small-[[mammal]] predation of the European pine sawfly |journal=The Canadian Entomologist |volume=91 |issue=5 |date=May 1959 |pages=293–320 |doi=10.4039/Ent91293-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FunctionalResponsesGraph.svg|thumb|300px|right|Types I, II, and III functional responses]]

== Type I ==

Type I functional response assumes a linear increase in intake rate with food density, either for all food densities, or only for food densities up to a maximum, beyond which the intake rate is constant. The linear increase assumes that the time needed by the consumer to process a food item is negligible, or that consuming food does not interfere with searching for food. A functional response of type I is used in the [[Lotka–Volterra equation|Lotka–Volterra]] predator–prey model. It was the first kind of functional response described and is also the simplest of the three functional responses currently detailed.

== Type II ==

Type II functional response is characterized by a decelerating intake rate, which follows from the assumption that the consumer is limited by its capacity to process food. Type II functional response is often modeled by a [[rectangular hyperbola]], for instance as by Holling's disc equation,&lt;ref name="Holling59b"&gt;{{cite article|last1=Holling|first1=C. S.|title=Some characteristics of simple types of predation and parasitism|journal=The Canadian Entomologist|volume=91|issue=7| date=July 1959 |pages=385&amp;ndash;98|doi=10.4039/Ent91385-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which assumes that processing of food and searching for food are mutually exclusive behaviors. The equation is
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align} 
f(R) &amp;= \frac{a R}{1 + a h R}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Wolves killing caribou.png|thumb|upright=1.2|''Wolves killing Caribou'', by [[Arthur Robert Harding]], 1909. If the number of [[wolf|wolves]] is held constant, the number of [[caribou]] killed increases, then levels off.&lt;ref name=Dale1994/&gt;]]

where ''f'' denotes intake rate and ''R'' denotes food (or resource) density. The rate at which the consumer encounters food items per unit of food density is called the attack rate, ''a''. The average time spent on processing a food item is called the handling time, ''h''. Similar equations are the [[Monod equation]] for the growth of [[microorganism]]s and the [[Michaelis–Menten equation]] for the rate of enzymatic reactions. 

In an example with [[wolves]] and [[caribou]], as the number of caribou increases while holding wolves constant, the number of caribou kills increases and then levels off. This is because the proportion of caribou killed per wolf decreases as caribou density increases. The higher the density of caribou, the smaller the proportion of caribou killed per wolf. Explained slightly differently, at very high caribou densities, wolves need very little time to find prey and spend almost all their time handling prey and very little time searching. Wolves are then satiated and the total number of caribou kills reaches a plateau.&lt;ref name=Dale1994&gt;{{cite article |last1=Dale |first1=Bruce W. |first2=Layne G. |last2=Adams |first3=R. Terry |last3=Bowyer |title=Functional Response of Wolves Preying on Barren-Ground Caribou in a Multiple-Prey Ecosystem |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |volume=63 |year=1994 |pages=644–652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Type III ==
Type III functional response is similar to type II in that at high levels of prey density, saturation occurs.  But now, at low prey density levels, the graphical relationship of number of prey consumed and the density of the prey population is a more than linearly increasing function of prey consumed by predators.  This accelerating function is largely descriptive, and often justified by learning time, prey switching, or a combination of both phenomena, but the type III functional response lacks the rigorous theoretical underpinning of the type II functional response. 

Learning time is defined as the natural improvement of a predator’s searching and attacking efficiency or the natural improvement in their handling efficiency as prey density increases.  Imagine a prey density so small that the chance of a predator encountering that prey is extremely low.  Because the predator finds prey so infrequently, it has not had enough experience to develop the best ways to capture and subdue that species of prey.  Holling identified this mechanism in [[shrews]] and [[deer mice]] feeding on [[sawflies]].  At low numbers of sawfly cocoons per acre, deer mice especially experienced exponential growth in terms of the number of cocoons consumed per individual as the density of cocoons increased.  The characteristic saturation point of the type III functional response was also observed in the deer mice.  At a certain density of cocoons per acre, the consumption rate of the deer mice reached a saturation amount as the cocoon density continued to increase.&lt;ref name="Holling59b"/&gt;

Prey switching involves two or more prey species and one predator species.  When all prey species are at equal prey densities, the predator will indiscriminately select between prey species.  However, if the density of one of the prey species decreases, then the predator will start selecting the other, more common prey species with a higher frequency.  Murdoch demonstrated this effect with [[guppy]] preying on tubificids and [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]]. As fruit fly numbers decreased guppies switched from feeding on the fruit flies on the water’s surface to feeding on the more abundant tubificids along the bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last1=Murdoch|first1=William W.|title=Stabilizing effects of spatial heterogeneity in predator-prey systems|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|volume=11|year=1977|pages=252&amp;ndash;73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green consumption''', is closely related to the notions of [[sustainable development]] or [[sustainable consumer behaviour]]. It is a form of consumption that is compatible with the safeguard of the environment for the present and for the next generations. It is a concept which ascribes to consumers responsibility or co-responsibility for addressing environmental problems through adoption of environmentally friendly behaviors, such as the use of organic products, clean and [[renewable energy]] and the research of goods produced by companies with zero, or almost, impact.&lt;ref&gt;J. Connoly, A. Prothero, 2008, Green consumption: life-politics, risk and contradictions, Journal of consumer culture, vol. 8, pp. 117-145&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In Western societies, during the ‘60s and the early ‘70s, the necessity to protect the environment and the people health from the effects caused by industrial pollutants and by the continuous growth of economic and population has developed this new idea of consumption. In the 1980s first American "green" brands began to appear and exploded on the American market. During the 1990s green products had a slow mild growth, remaining a niche phenomenon. American interest in green products . started to increase again in the early 2000s with greater speed and, despite the latest recession, it has been continuing to grow.&lt;ref&gt;R.Elliott, 2013, The taste for green:the possibilities and dynamics of status differentiation through "green" consumption, Sci Verse ScienceDirect, ELSEVIER, vol. 41, pp. 294-322&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and development ==
The origin of the necessity to behave in an environmental-friendly way goes back to the 1960s and '70s. In particular after the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis of 1973]], Western countries start to think about the use of renewable energy, as an alternative to fuel fossil. Nowadays green consumption is considered a basic point of environmental reform and it is also guarantee by supra-national organizations like European Union.  Some sociologist argue that after the increasing [[globalization]], people feel more interconnected with other people and the environment, so there has been increasing awareness of global [[environmental problems]], especially in western countries. 
The main forums in which the issue has been discussed, and provided guidelines to orient national governments are: [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment]]; [[International Union for Conservation of Nature#World Conservation Strategy|IUCN 1980 World Conservation Strategy]]; [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development in 1983 and 1987 Brundtland Report]]; Italy 1993 National Plan for Sustainable Development; Aalborg 1994, 1st European Conference on Sustainable Cities; Lisbon 1996, 2nd European Conference on Sustainable Cities; Hannover 2000, 3rd Conference on Sustainable Cities; European Union in 2001, VI Environmental Action Plan 2002/2010; Aalborg +10 and the Aalborg Commitments in 2004.

== Pro-environmental behavior ==
Green consumer behavior is a form of pro-environmental behavior, which can be defined as a form of consumption that harms the environment as little as possible, or even benefits the environment.&lt;ref&gt;L. Steg, C. Vlek, 2009, Encouraging pro-environmental behaviour: An integrative review and research agenda, Journal of environmental psychology, vol. 29, pp. 309-317&lt;/ref&gt; Past research has provided empirical support to the claim that green or pro-environmental consumer behavior is a multidimensional construct&lt;ref&gt;M. Ertz, F. Karakas, E. Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980&lt;/ref&gt; which is composed of:

* "Private-sphere behavior" refers to the purchase, use and disposal of personal and household products that have environmental impact,&lt;ref&gt;P. C. Stern, 2000, Toward a coherent theory of environmentally significant behavior, Journal of social issues, vol. 53, no.3, pp. 407-424&lt;/ref&gt; such as automobiles, public transportation, or recycling&lt;ref&gt;M. Ertz, F. Karakas, E. Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Public-sphere behavior" refers to behavior that affects the environment directly through committed environmental activism or indirectly by influencing public policies,&lt;ref&gt;P. C. Stern, 2000, Toward a coherent theory of environmentally significant behavior, Journal of social issues, vol. 53, no.3, pp. 407-424&lt;/ref&gt; such as active involvement in environmental organizations and demonstrations (direct impact) or petitioning on environmental issues (indirect impact)&lt;ref&gt;M. Ertz, F. Karakas, E. Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980&lt;/ref&gt;

The contextual factors such as monetary incentives, costs, regulations, public policy norms, as well as subjectively perceived factors such as perceived resources available&lt;ref&gt;E. Olli, G. Grendstad, D. Wollebaek, 2001, Correlates of environmental behaviors: Bringing back social context, Environment and Behavior, vol. 33, no. 2, pp. 181-208&lt;/ref&gt; have a strong impact on consumer pro-environmental behavior and thus green consumption through the mediating effect of attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ertz, F. Karakas, E. Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, it is through attitude, that subjectively perceived contextual factors such as, for example, the extent to which consumers perceive having more or less time, money and power available, modulate pro-environmental behavior, in general, and green consumption, in particular.

== Green consumer behavior ==
We can define a green consumer behavior the one that has these characteristics:

* "purchase choice, product use and post-use, household management, collective, and consumer activism behaviors, reflecting some degree of environmental- related motivation";&lt;ref&gt;K. Peattie, 2010, Green consumption: behavior and norms, vol. 35, pp. 195-228&lt;/ref&gt;
* "purchase and use of products with lower environmental impacts, such as biodegradable products, recycled or reduced packaging, and low energy usage";&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Pinto, M. M. Herter, P. Rossi, A. Borges, 2014, Going green for self or for others? Gender and identity salience effects on sustainable consumption, International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 540-549&lt;/ref&gt;
* use of organic product, made with processes that provide [[energy saving]], then by the action of [[recycling]], in fact a green consumer is "one who purchase products and services perceived to have a positive (or less negative) influence on the environment […]"&lt;ref&gt;K. Haws, R. Walker Naylor, K. Page Winterich, 2013, Seeing the world through GREEN- tinted Glasses: Green Consumption Values and Responses to Environmentally Friendly Products, Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/ref&gt; 
We can find a green consumer behavior when an individual acts ethically, motivated not only by his/her personal needs, but also by the respect and preservation of the welfare of entire society, because a green consumer takes into account the environmental consequences (costs and benefits) of his/her private consumption. Green consumers are expected to be more conscientious in their use of assets, for example by using their goods without wasting resources. 
However the Eurobarometer’s survey of consumers’ behavior (2013) showed that consumers seem not to be fully conscious of the importance to adopt a set of new behaviors, that are more environmental-friendly. In this report it is possible to find that even though a very high proportion of citizens buy green products (80%), more than a half are classified as occasional maintenance (54%), and only a quarter are regular buyer of green products (26%).
This fact implies that most of people do not behave like green consumer continuously, probably because of a lot of social and economic constraints, such as the fact that green products are much more expensive than non-green ones, and also because it is not always so easy to find organic and [[biological]] goods for each category, and because the green-retailers are not so widespread. Some researchers find that personal values are influential determinants of consumption and that pro-environmental behavior might serve as a signal of personality dimension. Considering the time-horizon in the acquisition of green behavior, we can distinguish two types of consumers:

# prevention-type consumers, that feel a moral duty towards a greener lifestyle
# promotion-type, that are more focused on their aspirations and their dreams and don't strongly feel the pressure to quickly adjust their behavior in the direction of becoming more environmental-friendly.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bertoli, M. Bonera, A. Codini, E. Corvi, G. Miniero, 2014, Being green: from attitude to actual consumption, International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 521-528&lt;/ref&gt;
Another research find the effect of gender and [[social identity]] on green consumption: "female declared higher levels of sustainable consumption compared with male participants; however when social identity is salient, male increased their [[sustainable consumption]] intentions to the same level as female.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Pinto, M. M. Herter, P. Rossi, A. Borges, 2014, Going green for self or for others? Gender and identity salience effects on sustainable consumption, International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 540-549&lt;/ref&gt;  In this research are identified two kind of people, that have more:

# self-transcendent values, like woman, that are more willing to engage in sustainable consumption
# self-enhanced values, like men, that are less interested in green behavior

The fact is that sustainable consumption is, for men, a way to reinforce their social image, showing to others that they care about environment, instead for women is intrinsically important. The evidence is that green consumers are mainly female, aged between 30 and 44 years old, well educated, in a household with a high annual income.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Pinto, M. M. Herter, P. Rossi, A. Borges, 2014, Going green for self or for others? Gender and identity salience effects on [[sustainable consumption]], International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 540-549&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principal areas of developed green consumption ==

=== [[Green energy]] ===
Green energy includes natural energetic processes that can be harnessed with little pollution.

=== Green food ===
In the food area, there is a recent growing of demand for less environmentally-damaging food production, that leads people to buy more [[organic food|organic]] and [[local food|local]] food.  
Organic food is produced through agriculture which does not use artificial chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and animals reared in more natural conditions, without the routine use of drugs, antibiotics and wormers common in intensive livestock farming. 
Consumers can also choose to buy local food in order to reduce the social and environmental impacts of "food miles" – the distance food travels between being produced and being consumed. This behavior can create a new sense of connection with the land, through a concern for the authenticity and provenience of the food eaten, operating a social as much as a technological innovation.&lt;ref&gt;G. Seyfang, 2007, Growing sustainable consumption communities, The case of local organic food networks, International Journal of Sociology and social policy, vol. 27, pp. 120-134&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, taste, health and safety concerns can be other reasons behind this consumption practices.

=== Green fashion ===
{{Main article|Sustainable fashion}}
''"Ethical clothing refers to clothing that takes into consideration the impact of production and trade on the environment and on the people behind the clothes we wear. Eco clothing refers to all clothing that has been manufactured using environmentally friendly processes. It includes organic textiles and sustainable materials such as hemp and non-textiles such as bamboo or recycled plastic bottles. It also includes recycled products (clothes made from recycled clothing including vintage, textile and other materials and can also be termed re-used) and is not necessarily made from organic fibers. Organic clothing means clothes that have been made with a minimum use of chemicals and with minimum damage to the environment and fair-trade is intended to achieve better prices, decent working conditions, local sustainability and fair terms for farmers and workers in the developing world".''&lt;ref&gt;M.C Cervellon, H. Hjerth, S. Ricard, L. Carey, 2010, GREEN IN FASHION? An exploratory study of national differences in consumers concern for eco-fashion, Paper presented at 9th International Marketing Trends Conference, Venice, Italy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The three main reasons that would motivate the purchase of organic cloths are:
* Environmental -friendly protection;
* Health impact;
* Ethical concerns.

Another important question is related to the textile and clothing industry that generates much pollution and consumes a large amount of resources. Improper uses and disposal of clothing products make the problems much more severe. 
Consumers are concerned about this (environmental) issues, and are best motivated to change their behaviors in a [[philanthropic]] or environmental-friendly actions that adapt with their financial and sustainability interests.
An intuitive and sustainable strategy is the reusing cloths. Textile recycling is a method of reprocessing used clothing, fibrous material and clothing scraps from the manufacturing process. This can reduce manufacturing pollution and [[resource consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;Z. H. Hu, Q. Li, X. J. Chen, Y. F. Wang, 2014, Sustainable Rent-Based Closed-Loop Supply Chain for Fashion Products, Sustainability, vol. 6, pp. 7063-7088&lt;/ref&gt;  The world is facing one of the worst economic crises ever, which affects all industries, including fashion and luxury. In this way moderate consumption is becoming an implicit rules.&lt;ref&gt;M.C Cervellon, H. Hjerth, S. Ricard, L. Carey, 2010, GREEN IN FASHION? An exploratory study of national differences in consumers concern for eco-fashion, Paper presented at 9th International Marketing Trends Conference, Venice, Italy&lt;/ref&gt;  
Consumers pay attention to the origin and the materials of the clothes they buy and the fact that they are not harmful to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton incorporated: http://www.cottoninc.com/corporate/Market-Data/SupplyChainInsights/consumer-perspectives-on-green-apparel/&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the issue of trust arises and a label certifying the organic origin is strongly required. 
But consumers often have a lack of information of green fashion or maybe they are unaware of the existence of green fashion alternatives to traditional adult fashion. 
Thus, there is a need to create awareness and inform better the consumers on the nature of organic fashion.

[[File:Robur tea advert 1912.png|thumb|Information about the different varieties of tea, its impact on people, [[Australia]], 1912]]

Although health benefits have been assumed throughout the history of using ''[[Camellia sinensis]]'' as a common beverage, there is no high-quality evidence that tea confers significant benefits.&lt;ref name="medline"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/997.html|title=Black tea|publisher=MedlinePlus, US National Library of Medicine|date=30 November 2017|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nccih"&gt;{{cite web|title=Green tea|url=https://nccih.nih.gov/health/greentea|publisher=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, US National Institutes of Health|accessdate=27 February 2018|date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[clinical research]] over the early 21st century, tea has been studied extensively for its potential to lower the risk of [[human diseases]], but none of this research is conclusive as of 2017.&lt;ref name=medline/&gt;

In regions without access to safe [[drinking water]], boiling water to make tea is effective for reducing [[waterborne diseases]] by destroying [[pathogenic]] [[microorganisms]].

== By constituents or substances ==

=== Aluminum, iron and other metals ===
{{further information|Aluminum#Health concerns}}
Tea drinking accounts for a high proportion of aluminum in the human diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.03.019 |journal=Food Chemistry |volume=104 |issue=4 |year=2007 |pages=1662–1669 |vauthors=Streeta R, Drábeka O, Szákováb J, Mládkováa L |title=Total content and speciation of aluminium in tea leaves and tea infusions}}&lt;/ref&gt; The levels are safe, but there has been some concern that aluminum traces may be associated with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. A 2013 study additionally indicated that some teas contained [[lead]] (mostly Chinese) and aluminum (Indian/Sri Lanka blends, China).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Benefits and Risks of Consuming Brewed Tea: Beware of Toxic Element Contamination | doi=10.1155/2013/370460 | pmid=24260033 | pmc=3821942 | volume=2013 | journal=Journal of Toxicology | pages=1–8| year=2013 | last1=Schwalfenberg | first1=Gerry | last2=Genuis | first2=Stephen J. | last3=Rodushkin | first3=Ilia }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Food Research International |volume=43 |issue=9 |year=2010 |pages=2234–2252 |title=Trace elements in tea leaves, made tea and tea infusion: A review |type=Review |vauthors=Karak T, Bhagat RM |doi=10.1016/j.foodres.2010.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most studies have found no association between tea intake and iron absorption.&lt;ref name="beck"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nutrients|year=2014|volume=6|issue=9|pages=3747–76|doi=10.3390/nu6093747|title=Dietary determinants of and possible solutions to iron deficiency for young women living in industrialized countries: a review|authors=Beck KL, Conlon CA, Kruger R, Coad J|pmid=25244367|pmc=4179187}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, drinking excessive amounts of black tea may inhibit the absorption of iron, and may harm people with [[anaemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wierzejska R |title=Tea and health--a review of the current state of knowledge |journal=Przegl Epidemiol |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=501–6, 595–9 |year=2014 |pmid=25391016 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have been raised about the traditional method of over-boiling tea to produce a [[decoction]], which may increase the amount of environmental contaminants released and consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Food Addit Contam Part a Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess|year=2014|volume=31|issue=11|pages=1794–804|title=Residues and contaminants in tea and tea infusions: a review|authors=Abd El-Aty AM, Choi JH, Rahman MM, Kim SW, Tosun A, Shim JH|pmid=25164107|doi=10.1080/19440049.2014.958575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluoride exposure ===
{{See also|Fluoride#Toxicology}}
All tea leaves contain [[fluoride]]; however, mature leaves contain as much as 10 to 20 times the fluoride levels of young leaves from the same plant.&lt;ref name="pmid17410113"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lung SC, Cheng HW, Fu CB |title=Potential exposure and risk of fluoride intakes from tea drinks produced in Taiwan |journal=J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=158–66 |year=2008 |pmid=17410113 |doi=10.1038/sj.jes.7500574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18078704"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malinowska E, Inkielewicz I, Czarnowski W, Szefer P |title=Assessment of fluoride concentration and daily intake by human from tea and herbal infusions |journal=Food Chem. Toxicol. |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=1055–61 |year=2008 |pmid=18078704 |doi=10.1016/j.fct.2007.10.039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fluoride content of a tea leaf depends on the leaf picking method used and the fluoride content of the soil from which it has been grown; tea plants absorb this element at a greater rate than other plants. Care in the choice of the location where the plant is grown may reduce the risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Accumulation of Fluoride and Aluminium Related to Different Varieties of Tea Plant |author1=Jianyun Ruan |author2=Ming H. Wong | journal = Environmental Geochemistry and Health | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–63 | year =  2001 | url =   | doi = 10.1023/A:1011082608631}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated that hand-picked tea would contain less fluoride than machine-harvested tea, because there is a much lower chance of harvesting older leaves during the harvest process. A 2013 British study of 38 teas found that cheaper UK supermarket tea blends had the highest levels of fluoride with about 580&amp;nbsp;mg per kilogram, green teas averaged about 397&amp;nbsp;mg per kg and pure blends about 132&amp;nbsp;mg per kg. The researchers suggested that economy teas may use older leaves which contain more fluoride. They calculated a person drinking a litre of economy tea per day would consume about 6&amp;nbsp;mg of fluoride, above the recommended average dietary intake level of 3-4&amp;nbsp;mg of fluoride per day, but below the maximum tolerable amount of 10&amp;nbsp;mg of fluoride per day.&lt;ref&gt;(25 July 2013) [http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/07July/Pages/do-fluoride-levels-in-cheap-tea-pose-a-health-risk.aspx Do fluoride levels in cheap tea pose a health risk?] British National Health Service "Choices, Retrieved 26 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oxalates ===
Tea contains [[oxalate]], overconsumption of which can cause [[kidney]] stones, as well as binding with free [[calcium]] in the body. The [[bioavailability]] of oxalate from tea is low, thus a possible negative effect requires a large intake of tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Theanine and caffeine ===
{{see also|Health effects of caffeine}}
Tea also contains [[theanine]] and the stimulant [[caffeine]] at about 3% of its dry weight, translating to between 30&amp;nbsp;mg and 90&amp;nbsp;mg per 8 oz (250 ml) cup depending on type, brand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bennett Alan Weinberg |author2=Bonnie K. Bealer |title=The World of Caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YdpL2YCGLVYC&amp;dq= |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-415-92722-2 |accessdate=2008-09-20 |page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; and brewing method.&lt;ref&gt;M. B. Hicks, Y-H. P. Hsieh, L. N. Bell, ''Tea preparation and its influence on methylxanthine concentration'', Food Research International 29(3-4) 325-330 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Tea also contains small amounts of [[theobromine]] and [[theophylline]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham H. N.; Green tea composition, consumption, and polyphenol chemistry; ''Preventive Medicine'' '''21'''(3):334-50 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Dry tea has more caffeine by weight than dry [[coffee]]; nevertheless, more dry coffee than dry tea is used in typical drink preparations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stashtea.com/caffeine+and+tea+information.aspx |title=Caffeine and Tea Information |publisher=Stash Tea |date= |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which results in a cup of brewed tea containing significantly less caffeine than a cup of [[health effects of coffee|coffee]] of the same size.

The caffeine in tea is a mild [[diuretic]]. However, the [[British Dietetic Association]] has suggested that tea can be used to supplement normal [[water]] consumption, and that "the style of tea and coffee and the amounts we drink in the UK are unlikely to have a negative effect [on hydration]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bda.uk.com/news/110610DehydrationWeek.pdf  BDA Supports Dehydration Awareness Week with some Handy Tips (PDF)]. British Dietetic Association, June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== By conditions ==

===Cognitive effects===
Drinking caffeinated tea may improve mental alertness.&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; There is preliminary evidence that the [[caffeine]] from long-term tea (or coffee) consumption provides a small amount of protection against the progression of [[dementia]] or [[Alzheimer's disease]] during aging, although the results across numerous studies were inconsistent.&lt;ref name="PanzaSolfrizzi2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panza|first1=Francesco|last2=Solfrizzi|first2=V.|last3=Barulli|first3=M.

=== Cancer ===
In 2011, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) reported that there was very little evidence to support the claim that green tea consumption may reduce the risk of breast and prostate cancer.&lt;ref name="FDA2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary of Qualified Health Claims Subject to Enforcement Discretion|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm073992.htm#gtea|author=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|date=24 February 2011|accessdate= 9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[National Cancer Institute]] reports that in [[Epidemiology#Types of studies|epidemiological studies]] and the few [[clinical trial]]s of tea for the prevention of cancer, the results have been inconclusive.  The institute "does not recommend for or against the use of tea to reduce the risk of any type of cancer." ...

===Fracture risk===
Tea consumption does not appear to affect the risk of [[bone fracture]] including [[hip fracture]]s or fractures of the [[humerus]] in men or women.&lt;ref name="Chen2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chen B, Shi HF, Wu SC |title=Tea consumption didn't modify the risk of fracture: a dose-response meta-analysis of observational studies|journal=Diagn Pathol|volume=9|issue=|pages=44|date=March 2014|pmid=24588938|pmc=4017777|doi=10.1186/1746-1596-9-44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weight loss ===

[[File:Flora OR - aerial.jpg|thumb|right|The small town of [[Flora, Oregon]] in the United States is unincorporated, but is considered a populated place.]]
[[File:Taos Pueblo2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.13|[[Taos Pueblo]], an ancient [[pueblo]] belonging to a [[Taos language|Taos]]-speaking [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe of [[Pueblo people]]. It is approximately 1000 years old and lies about 1 mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) north of the modern city of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], [[New Mexico]].]]
In [[geography]], [[statistics]] and [[archaeology]], a '''settlement''', '''locality''' or '''populated place''' is a [[community]] in which people live. The complexity of a settlement can range from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding [[Urban area|urbanized areas]]. Settlements may include [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s, [[village]]s, [[town]]s and [[city|cities]].  A settlement may have known historical properties such as the date or era in which it was first settled, or first settled by  particular people.

In the field of [[geospatial predictive modeling]], settlements are "a city, town, village or other agglomeration of buildings where people live and work".&lt;ref name=Semantics&gt;{{cite book |title= GeoSpatial Semantics: 4th International Conference, GeoS 2011, Brest, France |url= http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/archive/00001928/01/062.pdf |chapter= A Facet-Based Methodology for Geo-Spatial Modeling |last= Dutta |first= Biswanath |author2=Fausto Giunchiglia |author3=Vincenzo Maltese |year= 2010 |page= 143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A settlement conventionally includes its constructed facilities such as [[road]]s, [[enclosure]]s, [[field systems]], [[Boundaries in landscape history|boundary]] banks and [[ditch]]es, [[pond]]s, [[park]]s and [[wood]]s, [[windmill|wind]] and [[water mill]]s, [[manor house]]s, [[moat]]s and [[church (building)|church]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/msrg/msrgpolicy.htm  Medieval Settlement Research Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest remains that have been found of constructed dwellings are remains of huts that were made of mud and branches around 17,000&amp;nbsp;BC at the [[Ohalo]] site (now underwater) near the edge of the [[Sea of Galilee]]. The [[Natufian]]s built houses, also in the [[Levant]], around 10,000&amp;nbsp;BC. Remains of settlements such as [[village]]s become much more common after the invention of agriculture.

== In landscape history ==
[[File:Eoste Keldrimägi.JPG|thumb|Some settlement sites may go out of use. This location in [[Estonia]] was used for human settlement in 2nd half of first millennium and it is considered an [[archaeological record]], that may provide information on how people lived back then.]]
[[Landscape history]] studies the form (morphology) of settlements – for example whether they are [[dispersed settlement|dispersed]] or [[nucleated village|nucleated]]. [[Urban morphology]] can thus be considered a special type of cultural-historical landscape studies. Settlements can be ordered by size, centrality or other factors to define a [[settlement hierarchy]].

== Statistics ==

=== Australia ===
[[Geoscience Australia]] defines a populated place as "a named settlement with a population of 200 or more persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ga.gov.au/mapspecs/250k100k/appendixA_files/Habitation.jsp#Habitation%20Populated%20Place%20Point |title= NTMS Specifications (250K &amp; 100K): Populated place |publisher= [[Australian Government]] |accessdate= July 26, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110603115645/http://www.ga.gov.au/mapspecs/250k100k/appendixA_files/Habitation.jsp#Habitation%20Populated%20Place%20Point |archive-date= June 3, 2011 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee for Geographical Names in Australasia]] used the term [[Suburbs and localities (Australia)|localities]] for rural areas, while the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] uses the term "urban centres/localities" for urban areas.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
The [[Agency for Statistics in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] uses the term "populated place" for rural, and "municipality" and  "town" for urban areas.

=== Bulgaria ===
The Bulgarian Government publishes a National Register of Populated places (NRPP).

=== Canada ===
The Canadian government uses the term "populated place" in the ''[[Atlas of Canada]]'', but does not define it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/glossary/results.html?term= |title=Glossary Search Results |work=[[Atlas of Canada]] |publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] |accessdate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006185826/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/glossary/results.html?term= |archivedate=October 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Statistics Canada]] uses the term [[Census geographic units of Canada#Localities|localities]] for historical named locations.

=== Croatia ===
The [[Croatian Bureau of Statistics]] records population in units called [[settlement (Croatia)|settlements (''naselja'')]].

=== India ===
The Census Commission of [[India]] has a special definition of [[census town]]s.

=== Ireland ===
The  [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]] has a special definition of [[census town]]s.

=== Russia ===
There are various [[types of inhabited localities in Russia]].

=== Sweden ===
[[Statistics Sweden]] uses the term [[Urban areas in Sweden|localities (''tätort'')]] for various densely populated places. The common English-language translation is ''urban areas''.

=== United Kingdom ===
The UK [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] uses the term "urban settlement" to denote an [[urban area]] when analysing census information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/urbansettlement2001 Urban Settlement 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Registrar General for Scotland]] defines settlements as groups of one or more contiguous localities, which are determined according to [[population density]] and [[postcode]] areas. The Scottish settlements are used as one of several factors defining urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/the-census/key-stats-setloc-txt.pdf Scottish census information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218162030/http://gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/the-census/key-stats-setloc-txt.pdf |date=2010-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) has a [[Geographic Names Information System]] that defines three classes of human settlement:
# '''Populated place''' − [[Location (geography)|place]] or [[Area (country subdivision)|area]] with clustered or scattered [[building]]s and a permanent human [[population]] (city, settlement, town, village).  A populated place is usually not [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] and by definition has no legal boundaries. However, a populated place may have a corresponding "civil" record, the legal boundaries of which may or may not coincide with the perceived populated place.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:8:3692675055014428 |title= Feature Class Definitions |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate= July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Census''' − a statistical area delineated locally specifically for the tabulation of Census Bureau data (census designated place, census county division, unorganized territory, various types of American Indian/Alaska Native statistical areas).&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;
# '''Civil''' − a political division formed for administrative purposes ([[borough]], [[county]], [[Place (United States Census Bureau)|incorporated place]], [[municipio]], [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parish]], [[town]], [[township]])."&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;

Populated places may be specifically defined in the context of [[census]]es and be different from general-purpose administrative entities, such as [[Place (United States Census Bureau)|"place" as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau]] or [[census-designated place]]s.

== Geospatial modeling ==
In the field of [[geospatial predictive modeling]], settlements are "a city, town, village, or other agglomeration of buildings where people live and work".&lt;ref name=Semantics&gt;{{cite book |title= GeoSpatial Semantics: 4th International Conference, GeoS 2011, Brest, France |url= http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/archive/00001928/01/062.pdf |chapter= A Facet-Based Methodology for Geo-Spatial Modeling |last= Dutta |first= Biswanath |author2=Fausto Giunchiglia |author3=Vincenzo Maltese |year= 2010 |page= 143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Human Settlement Layer ([http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ GHSL]) framework produces global spatial information about the human presence on the planet over time. This in the form of built up maps, population density maps and settlement maps. This information is generated with evidence-based analytics and knowledge using new spatial data mining technologies. The framework uses heterogeneous data including global archives of fine-scale satellite imagery, census data, and volunteered geographic information. The data is processed fully automatically and generates analytics and knowledge reporting objectively and systematically about the presence of population and built-up infrastructures. The [http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ GHSL] operates in an open and free data and methods access policy (open input, open method, open output).

== Abandoned populated places ==
{{Main|Abandoned village|Ghost town}}
[[File:Namibie Kolmanskop 05.JPG|thumb|right|Abandoned buildings in [[Kolmanskop]], [[Namibia]]&lt;ref name="MapAtlas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mapatlas.org/Namibia/Abandoned_Populated_Place/Kolmanskop/3794/road_and_satellite_map |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415082058/http://en.mapatlas.org/Namibia/Abandoned_Populated_Place/Kolmanskop/3794/road_and_satellite_map |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 15, 2013 |title=Maps of Kolmanskop – Namibia 2012 |year=2012 |work=Map Atlas – Google Maps based atlas of the world |publisher=MapAtlas.org |accessdate=February 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The term "Abandoned populated places" is a ''Feature Designation Name'' in databases sourced by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]&lt;ref name="NGA Geonames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geonames.nga.mil/ggmagaz/feadesgsearchhtml.asp |title=Feature Designation Code Lookup |work=NGA: Geonames Search – OGC Viewer |publisher=[[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] |location=Springfield, VA, USA |accessdate=February 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102121347/http://geonames.nga.mil/ggmagaz/feadesgsearchhtml.asp |archivedate=January 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GeoNames]].&lt;ref name="GeoNames"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geonames.org/export/codes.html#P.PPLQ |title=GeoNames Feature Codes |date=February 10, 2012 |work=GeoNames |publisher=[[GeoNames]]|accessdate=February 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Populated places can be abandoned.  Sometimes the structures are still easily accessible, such as in a [[ghost town]], and these may become tourist attractions. Some places that have the appearance of a ghost town, however, may still be defined as populated places by government entities.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

A town may become a ghost town because the economic activity that supported it has failed, because of a government action, such as the building of a dam that floods the town, or because of natural or human-caused disasters such as floods, uncontrolled lawlessness, or war. The term is sometimes used to refer to cities, towns, and neighborhoods that are still populated, but significantly less so than in years past.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The '''Institute of Modern Languages''', also known as IML-UQ, is a language and translation institute located within the [[St Lucia]] campus of the [[University of Queensland]] (UQ) in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]. Today IML-UQ enrolls 3000 plus students annually in all of its language programs.

IML-UQ provides courses in over 30 languages. Designed to enrich the knowledge of a language and its culture, these courses are taught by native speakers with a focus on enhancing fluency and accuracy of expression. Apart from Latin, their content is based on themes and topics of the modern world in which we live.

IML-UQ is an [[Australians|Australian]] translator and interpreter service for 75 different languages, specialising in [[English Language|English]] language translations. Languages available at the IML-UQ include [[Arabic Language|Arabic]], [[Brazilian Portuguese Language|Brazilian Portuguese]], [[Cantonese]], [[Standard Chinese|Chinese Mandarin]], [[Croatian Language|Croatian]], [[Czech Language|Czech]], [[Dutch Language|Dutch]], [[Danish Language|Danish]], [[Finnish Language|Finnish]], [[French Language|French]], [[Greek Language|Greek]], [[German Language|German]], [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]], [[Hindi Language|Hindi]], [[Indonesian Language|Indonesian]], [[Italian Language|Italian]], [[Japanese Language|Japanese]], [[Korean Language|Korean]], [[Latin Language|Latin]], [[Norwegian Language|Norwegian]], [[Persian Language|Persian]], [[Polish Language|Polish]], [[Russian Language|Russian]], [[Spanish Language|Spanish]], [[Swedish Language|Swedish]], [[Thai Language|Thai]], [[Turkish Language|Turkish]] and [[Vietnamese Language|Vietnamese]] amongst many others.

Established in 1934, IML-UQ continues to serve the community by facilitating language learning and [[cross-cultural]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Working Papers in Asian Studies | issue = 6 | publisher = Centre for Asian Studies, The University of Western Australia | year = 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years it has sought to develop strategies to reach out to students in order to enrich their experience of learning another language. IML-UQ still meets the language service needs of the corporate sector, small businesses, government departments and community organisations. 
IML-UQ seeks to fulfill the original aspiration of the University of Queensland Senate to give more adults the chance to deepen their lives by bringing them into the university community via language courses open to the public.  
IML-UQ also provides a vehicle for UQ students to remain connected with its alumni in a meaningful way over the decades in which they are no longer engaged in more formal study.

== Background ==
When the seventh Senate of the University of Queensland met in March 1932, it stated its intentions "…to serve increasingly, despite straitened resources, not only education but whatever public needs science and learning could serve."&lt;ref name="AccountUQ"&gt;The University of Queensland. An Account of The University of Queensland during its First Twenty-five Years: 1910-1935.Brisbane: Biggs &amp; Company Pty., 1935, pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the ways these intentions were made manifest in 1934 was "to bring those classes under an Institute of Modern Languages (IML-UQ) associated with the Faculties of Arts and Commerce and to offer through it instruction in any modern language for which there should be a sufficient demand."&lt;ref name="AccountUQ"/&gt;

The successful launching of the IML-UQ was largely the result of the personal commitment to non-traditional university studies of a number of prominent University of Queensland academics. These academics recognised the demand for language teaching from the community at large.&lt;ref&gt;Thomis, I. Malcolm. A Place of Light &amp; Learning: The University of Queensland’s First Seventy-five Years. St Lucia: University of Queensland Press, 1985, p. 132-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation ==
When IML-UQ was established at the University of Queensland on 11 May 1934, it was the first adult education extension unit in modern languages to be attached to an Australian tertiary education institution. According to a university statute, IML-UQ was intended to "promote and extend the teaching of Modern Languages."&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, J. F. Statute Relating to the Institute of Modern Languages: The University of Queensland Act of 1909, Section 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Telegraph reported the University’s decision to establish IML-UQ as follows (12 May 1934): "At the meeting of the University Senate yesterday afternoon a recommendation for the establishment of IML-UQ was approved. This is clearly an important educational development, since it provides machinery for the study of foreign languages that have a cultural and commercial value for the State, and for which no provision is made in secondary schools for Junior, Senior, and Matriculation purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Thomis, I. Malcolm. A Place of Light &amp; Learning: The University of Queensland’s First Seventy-five Years. St Lucia: University of Queensland Press, 1985, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

IML-UQ commenced operations with one class each in French and Italian and two in German. In an article entitled ‘A Wider National Perspective’ (Courier-Mail, 14 May 1934, see page 5), the author articulates a vision of language education serving the national interest. The view was that IML-UQ courses would provide training in practical skills which would benefit business and international travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = A Wider National Perspective | publisher = The Courier Mail (Brisbane), 14 May 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Language programs were also endorsed as suitable educational ventures towards better international understanding and tolerance.

Australia’s changing perceptions of the non-English speaking world were reflected through the changing patterns of IML-UQ enrolments. New prospects in international commerce and tourism and the evolution of a cosmopolitan Australian society through post-war immigration were reflected in the diversification of language courses. These new courses were offered in response to public demand.

In another article, entitled ‘Foreign Languages’, which appeared in the Courier-Mail on the same day, the new IML-UQ courses were defined as follows: "The courses were…for commercial purposes, and would not enter so deeply into the literature of the languages as in an ordinary degree course, but rather would aim at the impartation of good working business knowledge of each tongue dealt with." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Foreign Languages | publisher = The Courier Mail (Brisbane), 14 May 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching methods ==
The history of language teaching at IML-UQ has been characterised by an ongoing search for more effective ways of teaching languages. 
The Grammar Translation Method was the main language teaching method in the initial decades. After this the Direct Method, which emphasises listening and speaking skills, was introduced.

Today, languages are primarily taught using the Communicative and Intercultural Language Teaching and Learning approaches with less emphasis on whole class activities and more on pair and group work.

== History ==

=== The early years: 1935–1965 ===
On 23 April 1934, resolutions to create a constitution and rules were passed by IML-UQ Joint Sub-Committee of the Faculties of Arts and Commerce. By 1937, special courses were added for those involved in scientific work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Institute of Modern Languages | publisher = The Courier Mail (Brisbane), 27 Feb 1937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, students of Russian reflected a sentiment that, "Russian will probably be useful in the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = They say Russian may be Useful | publisher = The Courier Mail (Brisbane), 29 March 1952 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1954, IML-UQ had grown to the point that a review of its purposes, services and administrative structures was required. The main priority was to establish IML-UQ as a provider of ‘adult education’, where courses would not enter ‘deeply into literature’ but focus on a ‘good working knowledge’ for practical application; followed by the expectation to satisfy requirements set for honours students in the Faculty of Commerce; and lastly to provide access to languages for which there was no provision in schools for Junior, Senior and Matriculation purposes.

All IML-UQ classes were held in the [[Old Government House, Queensland|Old Government House]] on [[George Street, Brisbane|George Street]]. By the late 1960s, all IML-UQ classes were transferred to the St Lucia campus, where they remain today. The first full-time IML-UQ director was appointed in 1965.

=== The middle years: 1965–1998 ===
Donald Munro was the first full-time Director of IML-UQ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Diaries of a Stretcher-Bearer: 1916-1918 | publisher = Boolarong Press | year = 2010 | author = Edward Munro | editor = Donald Munro | isbn = 1921555556 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1965 - 1970.

Mr Munro advocated the idea that learning languages would assist in community engagement. He believed that the study of a language would help students to understand the perspective of those who spoke that language. In his own words, his assumption was that "language and culture cannot be separated."&lt;ref&gt;D.J. Munro, "The University of Queensland Institute of Modern Languages," in Education News 10, no.10 (August 1966), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  He advocated that the study of language could itself form a cultural bridge, and thus is important for Australia’s migrant population.

He began a move to audio-lingual teaching methods by acquiring new teaching and learning equipment which could simultaneously play and record, so that students could compare their pronunciation with a master track.

Dr Max Brändle the second full-time IML-UQ director from 1970 - 1998, taught 5 languages at IML-UQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The German presence in Queensland over the last 150 years: proceedings of an international symposium, August 24, 25, and 26, 1987|last=|first=|publisher=University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia|year=|isbn=0867762527|location=|page=397|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[blogs.abc.net.au/queensland/2010/09/faces-of-brisbane-max-brandle-from-switzerland.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
During Dr Brändle’s time as IML-UQ director, IML-UQ established the first commercial ELICOS (English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students) centre in Australia that taught English solely to individual, full-fee paying students.  In 1988 the University set up a separate TESOL unit, now known as the [[Institute of Continuing &amp; TESOL Education]].

=== The later years (1999–) ===
Georgiana Poulter became the new IML-UQ Director in 1999, commencing a series of functional changes to the structure of Institute. 
In response to the increasing trend of global business, IML-UQ now includes a translation and interpreting service appropriate to the international market inclusive of local cultural needs. External clients range from the mining and engineering industry, to law firms, government departments, migration agents, and the IT, travel and advertising industries.

To enhance the effectiveness of teaching and learning which is the primary focus of IML-UQ, in-house training, or Professional Development (PD), workshops are now implemented for tutors and staff, and involvement with professional associations is encouraged. 
Translation, interpreting, language courses and customised tuition are the foundational components to support the purpose of IML-UQ in its ongoing role facilitating community engagement and links between UQ and the Brisbane community.

== Language programs ==

=== Adult programs ===
IML-UQ is designed to enhance employment opportunities, improve communication abilities, support lifelong learning and international travel, and maintain language skills in a practical adult (16+) learning environment. Year courses commence March of each year, and second semester courses commence in July. Short courses are offered in Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.

Languages currently taught at IML-UQ are:
Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese (Cantonese), Chinese (Mandarin), Croatian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek (Modern), Hebrew (Modern), Hindi, Indonesian, Irish Gaelic, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese.

=== Customised courses===
IML-UQ offers one-on-one and small group private tuition in most languages customised for business, government departments, companies, travel preparation, research, personal development and cross-cultural communication. Customised courses are designed to offer flexibility in course content, structure and teaching style at venues and times that suit the needs of students. Qualified and experienced tutors are selected specifically for each organisation or individual.

=== Summer high school program ===
These language enrichment courses are designed for students in the Senior phase of learning who wish to enrich their knowledge of the language and culture they are currently studying and practise their language skills over the long Summer holidays. The courses are taught by native speakers with a focus on enhancing fluency and accuracy of expression, with content based on themes and topics specified in the QSA Senior Syllabus.

The '''Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC)''' is an international centre for biological and [[biomedical research]] and graduate training based in Oeiras, Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=IGCiencia|title=IGC {{!}} A Special Place to Be|date=2014-05-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9y874pZeJw&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] (FCG) in 1961, and still supported by the Foundation, the IGC is organised in small independent research groups that work in an environment designed to encourage interactions with minimal hierarchical structure.

The scientific programme covers a wide range of domains and is at the interface of different disciplines. These include cell and [[developmental biology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[immunology]] and [[host-pathogen interaction]], [[Botany|plant biology]], sociobiology, [[computational biology]] and [[biophysics]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/pages/facilities.php/A=213___collection=article|title=IGC {{!}} Research {{!}} About IGC Research|website=www.igc.gulbenkian.pt|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC has state-of-the-art facilities and services, constantly updated and ready to explore new scientific ideas. All resources are at the disposal of all IGC scientists equally, and common services and equipment are also open to external users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/facilities/about|title=IGC {{!}} Serviços {{!}} Sobre Serviços IGC|last=|first=|date=|website=wwwpt.igc.gulbenkian.pt|language=pt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC hosts a number of [[Postgraduate education|graduate education]] and training programmes. Since 1993 the IGC runs innovative [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD programmes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/education/phdprogrammes|title=IGC {{!}} Education and Training {{!}} PhD Programmes|website=www.igc.gulbenkian.pt|language=pt|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;, directed towards intellectual breadth, creativity and independent scientific thought. Also, the IGC has a strong tradition in promoting science in society with dedicated outreach programmes. 

Around 400 people, including 300 researchers (students, postdocs, technicians and group leaders), from 41 different countries work at the IGC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/pages/facilities.php/A=121___collection=article|title=IGC {{!}} Facts and Figures|website=www.igc.gulbenkian.pt|language=pt|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1998, 88 research groups have already settled in the institute. Of these, 44 went to other institutions, mainly other research centres and universities in Portugal.

In 1998, under the Directorship of [[António Coutinho]], the IGC was restructured into the current set-up and mode of action. Jonathan Howard succeeded Coutinho as Director of the IGC from October 2012 until January 2018. Since 1 February 2018, [[Mónica Bettencourt-Dias]] is the Director of the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência.   

==History==
The establishment of the IGC was initiated in 1961 when the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]]’s board of trustees envisioned the creation of its own research centre to encourage multidisciplinary research, independent of universities, and without restrictions or prior interests. The original set up of the IGC included a Centre for Scientific Calculation (1962-1985), a Centre for Biology (1962), a centre for Pedagogical Innovation (1962-1980), a Centre for Agricultural Economy (1958-1986) and a Centre for Economy and Finances.  A new building alongside the Marquês de Pombal Palace, in Oeiras, was projected to make up the new campus planned with a set of infrastructures including laboratories, library, canteen and animal facility. In 1967, the Centre for Biology was officially inaugurated at the new Oeiras campus with four research groups in Cell Biology, Pharmacology, Microbiology and Physiology and around 20 researchers. From 1966 to 1969, four IGC leaders passed away: Delfim Santos (Pedagogical Innovation), António Gião (Scientific Calculation), Flávio Resende (Biology) and Luís Quartin Graça (Agricultural Economy).

In 1968 Luís Archer, jesuit priest and biologist, widely regarded as the ‘father' of molecular genetics in Portugal, returns to Portugal to set up the Molecular Genetics Laboratory at the IGC, in the Department of Cell Biology. The year after, in 1969, it was set up the ''Estudos Avançados de Oeiras'' (Oeiras Advanced Studies) to provide workshops, summer schools and international seminars to scientists.

In 1984, the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]]’s Board of Trustees decides that IGC will be a research centre exclusively dedicated to research and pos-graduated training in biology.

In 1989 the [http://www.itqb.unl.pt/ Instituto de Tecnologia Química e Biológica] (ITQB) and the [http://www.ibet.pt/ Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnológica] (iBET) were created and hosted in the IGC campus. With IGC, they will later form the Oeiras Campus.

[[António Coutinho]], immunologist and Head of the Immunobiology Unit in [[Pasteur Institute|Institut Pasteur]], is appointed the Director of the Oeiras Advanced Studies in 1991. In 1993 Coutinho starts the Gulbenkian PhD Programme in Biology and Medicine (PGDBM), a pioneering programme in Portugal and one of the first of this kind in the world. In 1998, António Coutinho is designated Director of the IGC and starts a new phase of the institute as a ‘host institution' with the mission of identifying, educating and incubating new research leaders, providing access to facilities, and financial and intellectual autonomy to pursue research projects.

The Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme at the IGC is established in 2006 and the research groups of the newly formed [[Champalimaud Foundation]] are hosted at the IGC to carry out research in systems neuroscience until 2011, when they move to the Champalimaud Foundation’s new building in Lisbon.

In 2008, the IGC participates for the first time in the music festival [[NOS Alive]] under a partnership established between “Everything is New”, promoter of NOS Alive, and the IGC to support fellowships for young researchers.

In 2010 and 2011, the IGC was ranked amongst the '10 Best Places for Post-docs' outside the USA, by [http://www.the-scientist.com/ The Scientist].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/30743/title/Best-Places-to-Work-Postdocs--2011/|title=Best Places to Work Postdocs, 2011|website=The Scientist Magazine®|language=en|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC celebrates its 50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary in 2011 and was awarded an Honorary Membership of the Ordem de Sant'Iago da Espada by the [[President of Portugal|President of the Portuguese Republic]].

The [http://cedoc.unl.pt/ Centro de Estudos de Doenças Crónicas] (CEDOC), from N [http://www.fcm.unl.pt/main/index.php?lang=en&amp;Itemid=351 OVA Medical School | Faculdade de Ciências Médicas] (NMS|FCM), incubated in IGC, moved in 2014 to its new building in Lisbon.

Jonathan Howard, immunologist and Professor of Genetics at the [[University of Cologne]], is appointed Director of the IGC in 2012, succeeding António Coutinho. Since February 2018, [[Mónica Bettencourt-Dias|Mónica Bettencourt Dias]] is the new Director of the IGC, succeeding Jonathan Howard.

==Research==

=== Main Accomplishments ===
- A study published in ''[[Nature Cell Biology]]'' in July 2018, coordinated by [[Mónica Bettencourt-Dias]], helped to better understand diseases that involve cells antennae, called [[Ciliopathy|ciliopathies]]. The researchers found that while cells use the same building materials for their antennae, they use them in different proportions and moments, thus creating the structurally different functions.This explains how their mutations, which occur in genetic diseases associated with [[Cilium|cilia]] (e.g. diseases leading to infertility, loss of vision, obesity), usually affect only some antennae, not all of them, and some patients show all of the symptoms, while others may have only one type of defect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jana|first=Swadhin Chandra|last2=Mendonça|first2=Susana|last3=Machado|first3=Pedro|last4=Werner|first4=Sascha|last5=Rocha|first5=Jaqueline|last6=Pereira|first6=António|last7=Maiato|first7=Helder|last8=Bettencourt-Dias|first8=Mónica|date=2018-07-16|title=Differential regulation of transition zone and centriole proteins contributes to ciliary base diversity|journal=Nature Cell Biology|language=En|volume=20|issue=8|pages=928–941|doi=10.1038/s41556-018-0132-1|pmid=30013109|issn=1465-7392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The research team led by Joana Gonçalves-Sá and Luís Rocha showed that there is a specific mood associated with religious celebrations, a "loving mood" that can influence human reproductive behaviour. Using worldwide data from [[Twitter]] and [[Google Trends]] they found that culture, and not only biology, drives human reproductive cycles. The study was published in ''[[Scientific Reports]]'' in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Ian B.|last2=Varela|first2=Pedro L.|last3=Bollen|first3=Johan|last4=Rocha|first4=Luis M.|last5=Gonçalves-Sá|first5=Joana|date=2017-12|title=Human Sexual Cycles are Driven by Culture and Match Collective Moods|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18262-5|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|pages=17973|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-18262-5|pmid=29269945|pmc=5740080|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Ana Domingos and her group devoted to the study of the biological causes underlying obesity published a breakthrough study in ''[[Nature Medicine]]'' in October 2017. They discovered an unforeseen population of immune cells ([[macrophage]]s) associated with [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic neurons]] in adipose tissue. These specialised macrophages are in direct contact with neurons and affect neuronal activation that is critical for fat mass reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/10/171009123158.htm|title=Making fat mice lean: Novel immune cells control neurons responsible for fat breakdown|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pirzgalska|first=Roksana M|last2=Seixas|first2=Elsa|last3=Seidman|first3=Jason S|last4=Link|first4=Verena M|last5=Sánchez|first5=Noelia Martínez|last6=Mahú|first6=Inês|last7=Mendes|first7=Raquel|last8=Gres|first8=Vitka|last9=Kubasova|first9=Nadiya|date=2017-10-09|title=Sympathetic neuron–associated macrophages contribute to obesity by importing and metabolizing norepinephrine|journal=Nature Medicine|language=En|volume=23|issue=11|pages=1309–1318|doi=10.1038/nm.4422|pmid=29035364|issn=1078-8956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- For many years biologists have wondered why plants have so many genes coding for proteins that are known to be essential for the nervous system of animals, called [[glutamate receptor]]s. A team led by Jose Feijó discovered a new function of these proteins, showing that moss sperm uses them to navigate towards the female organs and ensure offspring. The study was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ortiz-Ramírez|first=Carlos|last2=Michard|first2=Erwan|last3=Simon|first3=Alexander A.|last4=Damineli|first4=Daniel S.

- Using experimental models of [[sepsis]] in mice, a research team led by Miguel Soares discovered an unsuspected mechanism that is protective against sepsis. The study was published in the scientific journal ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]'' in June 2017 and provided new avenues for therapeutic approaches against sepsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weis|first=Sebastian|last2=Carlos|first2=Ana Rita|last3=Moita|first3=Maria Raquel|last4=Singh|first4=Sumnima|last5=Blankenhaus|first5=Birte|last6=Cardoso|first6=Silvia|last7=Larsen|first7=Rasmus|last8=Rebelo|first8=Sofia|last9=Schäuble|first9=Sascha|date=2017-06|title=Metabolic Adaptation Establishes Disease Tolerance to Sepsis|journal=Cell|volume=169|issue=7|pages=1263–1275.e14|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.031|issn=0092-8674|pmc=5480394|pmid=28622511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Moisés Mallo and his research group have discovered the key factor that regulates trunk [[Developmental biology|development]] in [[vertebrate]]s and explains why [[snake]]s have such a strikingly different body. These findings published in ''[[Developmental Cell]]'' in August 2016, contributed to understand the origin of the exceptionally long trunks that characterise the body of [[snake]]s and may open new avenues to the study of [[spinal cord]] [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aires|first=Rita|last2=Jurberg|first2=Arnon D.|last3=Leal|first3=Francisca|last4=Nóvoa|first4=Ana|last5=Cohn|first5=Martin J.|last6=Mallo|first6=Moisés|date=2016-08|title=Oct4 Is a Key Regulator of Vertebrate Trunk Length Diversity|journal=Developmental Cell|volume=38|issue=3|pages=262–274|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2016.06.021|pmid=27453501|issn=1534-5807}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shylo|first=Natalia A.|last2=Weatherbee|first2=Scott D.|date=2016-08|title=Of Mice and Snakes: A Tail of Oct4|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1534580716305135|journal=Developmental Cell|volume=38|issue=3|pages=224–226|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2016.07.020|pmid=27505413|issn=1534-5807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- A research team led by [[Mónica Bettencourt-Dias|Mónica Bettencourt Dias]] shed light upon the critical mechanism of how [[oocyte]]s, the maternal gametes, lose [[centriole]]s and the importance of doing so for female fertility. The results published in the scientific journal [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] in May 2016 showed that [[centriole]]s normally have a coating that protects them which is lost inside the oocyte, eliminating therefore the centrioles. They further show that if the centrioles are not eliminated, those mothers are sterile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pimenta-Marques|first=A.|last2=Bento|first2=I.|last3=Lopes|first3=C. a.

- IGC scientists led by Miguel Godinho Ferreira found that certain organs, such as the gut, start to age before other tissues because its cells have a "timekeeper" with a faster pace. The results published in the journal [[PLOS Genetics|''PLoS Genetics'']] in January 2016 also showed that monitoring the pace of these timekeepers can be a good indicator for the aging of the whole organism since the appearance of local age-related lesions anticipates the onset of age-associated diseases, such as cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carneiro|first=Madalena C.|last2=Henriques|first2=Catarina M.|last3=Nabais|first3=Joana|last4=Ferreira|first4=Tânia|last5=Carvalho|first5=Tânia|last6=Ferreira|first6=Miguel Godinho|date=2016-01-20|title=Short Telomeres in Key Tissues Initiate Local and Systemic Aging in Zebrafish|journal=PLOS Genetics|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=e1005798|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005798|issn=1553-7404|pmc=4720274|pmid=26789415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Research led by Raquel Oliveira, has elucidated how cells are almost blind to [[chromosome]] cohesion defects. The results published in ''[[Cell Reports]]'' in October 2015 uncovered how these defects, often associated with [[cancer]] development, [[congenital diseases]] and [[infertility]], evade the strict surveillance of the checkpoint mechanisms that ensure faithful [[genome]] segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mirkovic|first=Mihailo|last2=Hutter|first2=Lukas H.|last3=Novák|first3=Béla|last4=Oliveira|first4=Raquel A.|date=2015-10|title=Premature Sister Chromatid Separation Is Poorly Detected by the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint as a Result of System-Level Feedback|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211124715010311|journal=Cell Reports|volume=13|issue=3|pages=469–478|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.020|pmid=26456822|issn=2211-1247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mirkovic|first=Mihailo|last2=Hutter|first2=Lukas H.|last3=Novák|first3=Béla|last4=Oliveira|first4=Raquel A.|date=2015-10|title=Premature Sister Chromatid Separation Is Poorly Detected by the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint as a Result of System-Level Feedback|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211124715010311|journal=Cell Reports|volume=13|issue=3|pages=469–478|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.020|pmid=26456822|issn=2211-1247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Studies on the [[bacteria]] ''[[Wolbachia]]'' conducted by Luis Teixeira and his research group revealed that a single genomic change can turn beneficial bacteria into [[pathogenic bacteria]], by boosting bacterial density inside the host. ''Wolbachia'' is a bacterium commonly present in [[insect]] species that can protect their hosts against [[virus]]es, including the [[dengue fever]] virus. These findings were published in the journal [[PLOS Biology|''PLoS Biology'']] in February 2015, in the first study linking genes and their functions in the ''Wolbachia'' bacterium and providing a starting point for the understanding of the widespread insect-''Wolbachia'' symbiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chrostek|first=Ewa|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luis|date=2015-02-10|title=Mutualism Breakdown by Amplification of Wolbachia Genes|journal=PLOS Biology|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=e1002065|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002065|issn=1545-7885|pmc=4323108|pmid=25668031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- In a study published in the scientific journal [[Cell (journal)|''Cell'']] in December 2014, a research team at IGC led by Miguel Soares discovered that specific bacterial components in the human [[Gut flora|gut]] [[microbiota]] can trigger a natural defence mechanism that is highly protective against [[malaria]] transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yilmaz|first=Bahtiyar|last2=Portugal|first2=Silvia|last3=Tran|first3=Tuan M.|last4=Gozzelino|first4=Raffaella|last5=Ramos|first5=Susana|last6=Gomes|first6=Joana|last7=Regalado|first7=Ana|last8=Cowan|first8=Peter J.|last9=d’Apice|first9=Anthony J.F.|date=2014-12|title=Gut Microbiota Elicits a Protective Immune Response against Malaria Transmission|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867414014251|journal=Cell|volume=159|issue=6|pages=1277–1289|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.053|issn=0092-8674|pmc=4261137|pmid=25480293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bordon|first=Yvonne|date=2015-01|title=Gut bacteria cross malaria|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nri3796|journal=Nature Reviews Immunology|language=En|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.1038/nri3796|pmid=25534616|issn=1474-1733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=IGCiencia|title=How gut bacteria are protective against malaria - Video animation|date=2014-12-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnAhiECenPc&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Three research groups at IGC lead by Jocelyne Demengeot, Karina Xavier and Isabel Gordo joint efforts to unveil how the [[bacteria]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli''), one of the first species to colonize the [[Gut flora|human gut]] at birth, adapts and evolves in the [[mouse]] intestine. The study published in [[PLOS Genetics|''PLoS Genetics'']] in March 2014, showed that [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] with different advantageous [[mutation]]s rapidly emerge and, consequently, a large [[genetic variation]] in this species is generated over time demonstrating how rich the [[evolutionary dynamics]] of each bacteria is in a healthy animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barroso-Batista|first=João|last2=Sousa|first2=Ana|last3=Lourenço|first3=Marta|last4=Bergman|first4=Marie-Louise|last5=Sobral|first5=Daniel|last6=Demengeot|first6=Jocelyne|last7=Xavier|first7=Karina B.|last8=Gordo|first8=Isabel|date=2014-03-06|title=The First Steps of Adaptation of Escherichia coli to the Gut Are Dominated by Soft Sweeps|journal=PLOS Genetics|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e1004182|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004182|issn=1553-7404|pmc=3945185|pmid=24603313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The research team led by Henrique Teotónio in collaboration with Isabel Gordo, both from the IGC, has experimentally tested the [[Haldane's rule|Haldane's theory]] for the first time. The study was published in ''[[Nature Communications]]'' in September 2013 and confirmed this theory for the introduction of a new beneficial [[allele]] in a population. The study contributes to a better comprehension of how a population can evolve, with implications for studies on how species adapt to changing environments or species conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chelo|first=Ivo M.|last2=Nédli|first2=Judit|last3=Gordo|first3=Isabel|last4=Teotónio|first4=Henrique|date=2013-09-13|title=An experimental test on the probability of extinction of new genetic variants|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3417|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|pages=2417|doi=10.1038/ncomms3417|issn=2041-1723|pmc=3778522|pmid=24030070}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130913085804.htm|title=Fate of new genes cannot be predicted|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- In August 2013, the research team led by Miguel Godinho Ferreira in collaboration with Isabel Gordo, showed for the first time that [[Chromosomal rearrangement|chromosomes rearrangements]] (such as inversions or translocations) can provide advantages to the cells that harbor them depending on the environment they are exposed.

- The researcher Miguel Soares co-authored a review in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']], in February 2012, on a largely overlooked strategy for treating [[infectious diseases]]. The [[immune system]] protects from infections by detecting and eliminating invading pathogens. The authors purposed a third strategy considering tolerance to infection, whereby the infected host protects itself from infection by reducing tissue damage and other negative effects caused by the pathogen or the immune response against the invader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Medzhitov|first=Ruslan|last2=Schneider|first2=David S.|last3=Soares|first3=Miguel P.|date=2012-02-24|title=Disease Tolerance as a Defense Strategy|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6071/936|journal=Science|language=en|volume=335|issue=6071|pages=936–941|doi=10.1126/science.1214935|issn=0036-8075|pmc=3564547|pmid=22363001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- In December 2011 the study published in ''[[Developmental Cell]]'' by Lar Jansen and his team uncovered a very simple, neat mechanism whereby the cell couples DNA duplication, [[cell division]] and [[centromere]] assembly. By using the same machinery for all these steps but in opposite ways, the cells confirm that the right number of copies of both genes and centromeres are made by allowing each the appropriate time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silva|first=Mariana C.C.|last2=Bodor|first2=Dani L.|last3=Stellfox|first3=Madison E.|last4=Martins|first4=Nuno M.C.|last5=Hochegger|first5=Helfrid|last6=Foltz|first6=Daniel R.|last7=Jansen|first7=Lars E.T.|date=2012-01|title=Cdk Activity Couples Epigenetic Centromere Inheritance to Cell Cycle Progression|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1534580711004667|journal=Developmental Cell|volume=22|issue=1|pages=52–63|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2011.10.014|pmid=22169070|issn=1534-5807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The IGC has been part of the multinational team of researchers from 10 countries that sequenced the [[genome]] of the tiny spider mite in a study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', in November 2011.

- A team led by Florence Janody have uncovered a surprising link between the cell's skeleton and organ size. It was shown in a study published in ''Development'', in April 2011, that one of the proteins that regulates the [[Cytoskeleton|skeleton]] of the cell also acts to blocks activation of genes that promote cell survival and proliferation. These findings add to the puzzle of understanding how proliferation genes are abnormally activated, often leading to tumours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernández|first=Beatriz García|last2=Gaspar|first2=Pedro|last3=Brás-Pereira|first3=Catarina|last4=Jezowska|first4=Barbara|last5=Rebelo|first5=Sofia Raquel|last6=Janody|first6=Florence|date=2011-06-01|title=Actin-Capping Protein and the Hippo pathway regulate F-actin and tissue growth in Drosophila|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/138/11/2337|journal=Development|language=en|volume=138|issue=11|pages=2337–2346|doi=10.1242/dev.063545|issn=0950-1991|pmid=21525075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- A research team led by Miguel Soares found that free [[heme]], released from red blood cells during infection, is the cause of organ failure, leading to the lethal outcome of severe [[sepsis]]. Moreover, the team found that the toxic effect of free heme can be overcome by hemopexin, a naturally occurring molecule that neutralises free heme.

- A study published in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'',]] in September 2010, by a team of researchers led by Miguel Godinho Ferreira solved a paradox related to [[telomere]]s, the protective tips of [[chromosome]]s. The broken chromosome ends generated by DNA damage are quickly joined together. However, telomeres are never tied to each other, thus allowing for the correct segregation of the genetic material into all cells. The researchers found that one of the [[histone]]s neighbouring the telomeres lacks a chemical signal, thus rendering the DNA damage recognition machinery incapable of arresting the [[cell cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carneiro|first=Tiago|last2=Khair|first2=Lyne|last3=Reis|first3=Clara C.|last4=Borges|first4=Vanessa|last5=Moser|first5=Bettina A.|last6=Nakamura|first6=Toru M.|last7=Ferreira|first7=Miguel Godinho|date=2010-09-09|title=Telomeres avoid end detection by severing the checkpoint signal transduction pathway|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=467|issue=7312|pages=228–232|doi=10.1038/nature09353|issn=0028-0836|pmc=3196630|pmid=20829797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== PhD Programmes ==
The IGC has started the postgraduate training with the format of a PhD programme in 1993 with the Gulbenkian PhD Programme in Biology and Medicine (PGDBM) followed by the Gulbenkian PhD Programme in Biomedicine (PGDB). In 2013, 20 years after the first structured PhD programme in Portugal, the [[Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia|Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia]] (FCT) started supporting the PhD Programme in Integrative Biomedical Sciences (PDIGC - PIBS) that has been continued as the [http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/education/ibbprogramme PhD Programme in Integrative Biology and Biomedicine] (IBB), the current programme. In 2014, a new and ambitious [http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/education/pgcd PhD programme was launched, the Graduate Program Science for Development] (PGCD) that aims to educate a new generation of excellent scientists and university professors in life sciences in the African countries of Portuguese language (PALOP) and East Timor.

The IGC is also part of a joint [http://www.itqb.unl.pt/education/phdhostmicrointerface PhD Program Biology at the Host Microbe Interface] (INTERFACE) ran by the [http://www.itqb.unl.pt/ Instituto de Tecnologia Química e Biológica] (ITQB NOVA), Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC) and [https://imm.medicina.ulisboa.pt/en/ Instituto de Medicina Molecular] (iMM).

The IGC has also had two other PhD Programmes, the [http://pdbc.igc.gulbenkian.pt/index.php?menu=home PhD Programme in Computational Biology] (PDBC) the first doctoral programme in computational biology in Portugal launched in 2005, and the Programme for Advanced Medical Education (PGMFA), both important to fulfil gaps in research and training of these two fields.

== Science Outreach ==
The dialogue between scientists and society is crucial and the IGC is committed to promoting this interaction, both at the Institute and wider afield. Open Days, Researchers' Night, school's outreach and informal education programmes reach every year hundreds of students, teachers and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/outreach|title=IGC {{!}} Outreach|website=www.igc.gulbenkian.pt|language=pt|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infrastructure ==
The IGC is resourced with state-of-the-art equipment and facilities, and run by highly qualified staff. Facilities include bio-computing services, animal SPF ([[Specific-pathogen-free|Specific Pathogen Free]]) facilities including a "germ-free" unit, transgenics unit, plant facility, high-speed cell sorting, [[Electron microscope|electron]] and advanced microscopy, next generation sequencing, monoclonal antibody preparation and histopathology. Other services include a library, a dedicated in-house data center and IT team, as well as a research funding office and project management team.

The '''Kunsthalle Bremen''' is an art museum in [[Bremen]], [[Germany]]. It is located close to the Bremen Old Town on the "Culture Mile" ({{lang-de|Kulturmeile}}). The [[Kunsthalle]] was built in 1849, enlarged in 1902 by architect Eduard Gildemeister, and expanded several more times, most notably in 2011. Since 1977, the building has been designated a [[Kulturdenkmal]] on Germany's buildings heritage list.&lt;ref name = denkmal&gt;{{WP-HB LfD|0084|Database of Landesamt für Denkmalpflege Bremen #0084}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum houses a collection of European paintings from the 14th century to the present day, sculptures from the 16th to 21st centuries and a New Media collection. Among its highlights are French and German paintings from the 19th and 20th century, including important works by [[Claude Monet]], [[Édouard Manet]] and [[Paul Cézanne]], along with major paintings by [[Lovis Corinth]], [[Max Liebermann]], [[Max Beckmann]] and [[Paula Modersohn-Becker]]. The New Media section features works by [[John Cage]], [[Otto Piene]], [[Peter Campus]], [[Olafur Eliasson]], and [[Nam June Paik]]. The Department of Prints and Drawings has 220,000 sheets from the 15th to 20th centuries, one of largest collections of its kind in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Kunsthalle Bremen at: [http://www.euromuse.net/en/museums/museum/view-m/kunsthalle-bremen/ Euromuse.net - the exhibition portal for Europe] {{en icon}} retrieved 2 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kunsthalle Bremen is operated by the non-profit Bremen Art Society ({{lang-de|Kunstverein Bremen}}), making it the only German museum with an extensive art collection from the 14th to 21st centuries which is still in private ownership.&lt;ref name="noble9"&gt;[[Wulf Herzogenrath]], Ingmar Laehnemann: ''Noble Gäste. 200 Meisterwerke der Kunsthalle Bremen zu Gast in 22 deutschen Museen'' (Bremen: Hachmannedition, 2009) {{ISBN|978-3939429586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== History of the Art Society ===
In 1823, a group of 34 businessmen interested in art founded an Art Society ({{lang-de|Kunstverein}}) in [[Bremen]] with the aim of "spreading a sense of beauty and form." It is one of the oldest such societies in Germany. The first years of the association's activities were focused on private art exhibitions, with the acquisition of works backed financially from ticket proceeds and business donations. Ten years after its founding, the Society owned 13 paintings, 585 drawings and 3917 leaf prints. The majority of the paintings were Old Masters, including the famous Madonna of Masolino and a series of paintings of Dutch painters of the 17th Century, such as [[Jan van Goyen]] and [[Pieter Wouwerman]].  After 1843, large public exhibitions were organized in association with similar associations in [[Hannover]], [[Lübeck]], [[Greifswald]], [[Rostock]] and [[Stuttgart]]. By 1846 the society had grown to 575 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunsthalle-bremen.de/kunsthalle/ueber-uns/geschichte/die-anfaenge-1823-1847/ Geschicht: Die Anfänge (1823-1847)] at Kunstverein Bremen {{icon de}} retrieved 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manya Ocken: ''The Kunstverein in Bremen in the 19th Century'' (University of Bonn, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; The Kunstverein Bremen is still the exclusive owner of the Kunsthalle Bremen and today has over 8000 members. The society is funded from foundations, private donations, bequests, and grants from the city of Bremen.&lt;ref&gt;Kunstverein Bremen: [https://web.archive.org/web/20111006185106/http://www.kunsthalle-bremen.de/kunstverein/ueber-uns-kv/ About Us] {{icon de}} retrieved 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of the Kunsthalle ===

==== The building of 1849 ====
[[File:Kunsthalle Bremen - J. Bremermann - 1849.jpg|thumb|The Kunsthalle Bremen in 1849]]
Supported by numerous foundations and patrons, the Art Society put out a competitive bid for a new museum building. A then very young Lueder Rutenberg - himself a member of the Art Association - won against prominent competitors. The Society broke ground on the Kunsthalle on 1 July 1847, becoming the first Society in Germany with its own building. The construction project was located on a former rubbish dump in the vicinity of the old city ramparts and the building was finished in 1849. Rutenberg's design was of a dignified but understated two-story building with a three-axis central projection of round arches.&lt;ref name = denkmal/&gt; While the collections were largely owned by the Kunstverein, the property itself was owned by the city. Four stone figures over the entrance are of [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Dürer]], and [[Rubens]], created by the sculptor Adolph Steinhäuser (1825-1858).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunsthalle-bremen.de/kunsthalle/ueber-uns/geschichte/die-anfaenge-1823-1847/ Geschicht: Der Bau der Kunsthalle (1847-1849)] at the Kunstverein Bremen {{icon de}} retrieved 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Expansion in 1902 ====
[[File:Kunsthalle Bremen Treppenhaus.jpg|thumb|The Kunsthalle's new central hall in 1902, destroyed in World War II]]
After another competition among Bremen architects, a much-needed enlargement was commissioned in 1898. Albert Dunkel was selected to design the interiors, Eduard Gildemeister for the monumental sandstone facade, and decoration by renowned sculptors Georg Roemer and [[Georg Wrba]]. The foundation work was begun in 1899 and on 15 February 1902 the opening ceremony took place. The facade was under construction until 1904. The expansion was funded by foundations and businessmen in Bremen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunsthalle-bremen.de/kunsthalle/ueber-uns/geschichte/der-erweiterungsbau-der-kunsthalle-1899-1902/ Geschichte: Der Erweiterungsbau der Kunsthalle (1899-1902))] at the Kunstverein Bremen {{icon de}} retrieved 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consequences of World War II ====
[[File:Übergang Washingtons über den Delaware.jpg|thumb|The original ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'' (1849–50) by [[Emanuel Leutze]] was destroyed in an air raid on 5 September 1942]]
The art gallery was closed shortly after the outbreak of war and the collection was initially stored in the basement. In the night of 5 September 1942, a fire bomb destroyed the central staircase and six rooms upstairs. It also burned the painting ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'' by [[Emanuel Leutze]], which because of its size could not be removed. Today a second version hangs in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name = kunsthalle&gt;Kunsthalle Bremen: ''Geschichte 1914-1945'' [http://www.kunsthalle-bremen.de/kunsthalle/ueber-uns/geschichte/emil-waldmann-1914-1945/ online] {{icon de}} retrieved 3 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After this damage, large parts of the collection were moved to protected areas underneath the Bremer Landesbank and Norddeutschen Kreditbank. As the severity of air raids on Bremen increased, Mayor Böhmcker finally decreed that the collection should be housed outside the city in safety. The removal of the artworks began in 1943 to four different places: the paintings, drawings and graphic sheets were divided between Karnzow Castle of Count Konigsmark in [[Kyritz]], Schloss Neumühle of Count von der Schulenburg in [[Salzwedel]], and Schwöbber Castle  near [[Hameln]]. The sculptures were taken to the royal crypt at Bückeburg Castle.&lt;ref name="kunsthalle"/&gt;

Karnzow Castle was located in [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] closer to [[Berlin]] and it held 50 paintings, 1715 drawings and about 3000 prints from the collection. The castle was taken in May 1945 by Soviet troops and on their return home it was plundered. The Soviets also left the hiding place open, with the result that works of art were within the reach of everyone. Berlin sculptor Kurt Reutti, head of a unit of the Berlin City Council, was able to find several items by extensive research and reclamation from the local black market. However, the losses of the Kunsthalle Bremen stand alongside those of the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] and the Dresden art collections as the largest and most devastating of any German museum from the war. In all over 1,500 works from the Kunsthalle remain missing today.&lt;ref name = akinsha&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1017/S0940739110000111|title=Why Can't Private Art "Trophies" Go Home from the War?|last1=Akinsha|first1=Konstantin|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|volume=17|issue=27|pages=257–290 |date= 17 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reconstruction after 1945 ====
In the immediate postwar period, the conditions of the Museum and the activities of the Art Society were extremely difficult. Between 1947 and 1948, soldiers of the US Army were billeted in the art gallery, Print Room and Board Room. Because of war damage the building was unusable for displaying art, although exhibitions were organized at other locations starting in 1946. In 1948, ten rooms upstairs were again opened to the public for the 125th anniversary of the Art Society. After further repairs, all rooms on the upper floor were usable again by the end of 1951. In 1961 an extensive restoration was carried out which repaired the heavy war damage. The staircase and the front entrance were modernized in the style of the time.

==== Expansion in 1982 ====
An extension to the building was completed in 1982 by architect Werner Düttmann and caused a scandal. Contrary to the plans which had been approved in sandstone red brick facade was built instead.

==== Renovations 1990-1999 ====
In 1990 the Art Society secured financing for the renovation of the workshops, storage areas and the main Print Room of the now structurally and functionally obsolete building. Between 1996 and 1998, more renovations of the Art Gallery continued under the chairman Georg Abegg and director [[Wulf Herzogenrath]]. These were urgent because the exhibition halls were in poor condition, the lighting did not meet the requirements and climate conditions did not meet international standards.

In 1995 the Art Society's board of trustees began a "Save the Art Gallery" capital campaign under the leadership of the merchant and deputy chairman Dieter Harald Berghöfer, which reached out to patrons. Within one year it had received 7 million marks, a third of the calculated construction costs (in a city with fewer than 600,000 inhabitants).&lt;ref name=NYT1998&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Galloway | date=30 May 1998 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/30/style/30iht-bremen.t.html | title=City Has Rejuvenated the Focke and Kunsthalle: Bremen Brushes Up Its Museums | newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of Bremen and the Federal Republic then provided the other two thirds. Due to unexpected difficulties with the building, construction costs rose to almost 25 million DM, and these additional costs were raised solely by donors who wanted to support the efforts of the Art Society and the Board of Trustees.

As a result of the renovation, golden oak parquet replaced the linoleum, while the 24 halls and intimate cabinets in which the permanent collection is grouped are bathed in color.&lt;ref name=NYT1998 /&gt;

====Extension 2011====
Between 2009 and 2011, the older constructions of 1961 and 1982 were demolished and two modernist, cubic wings with 5560 square meters of gross floor area were added to the old main building according to the plans by architects Hufnagel, Putz and Rafaelian. The main building with 7410 square meters of gross floor area was completely renovated and portions modernized. The project cost around €30 million. The families of Friedrich and Peter Lürssen shipyard and Lürßen from the Karin and Uwe Hollweg Foundation contributed a third, and the city of Bremen and the Federal Government each one-third of these costs. Additional costs of €3.5 million for geothermal heating. The new Art Gallery opened on 20 August 2011 and held its first major exhibition at the on 15 October 2011.

The New Media section features works by [[John Cage]], [[Otto Piene]], [[Peter Campus]], [[Olafur Eliasson]], [[Nam June Paik]] and others. The Kunstverein promotes current art trends by awarding the Böttcherstrasse Art Prize and organizing exhibitions of the ''Förderkreis für Gegenwartskunst'' (association for the support of contemporary art).

=== Baldin Collection ===
{{Main article|Baldin Collection}}
In 1945 Soviet Army officer Viktor Baldin discovered the stored works from the Kunsthalle in the basement of Karnzow Castle. In order to protect them from complete destruction, he grabbed drawings by [[Rembrandt]], [[Titian]], [[Rubens]], [[Goya]], [[Van Gogh]] and [[Édouard Manet]] and brought them to the [[Soviet Union]] in a suitcase. In 1963 Baldin became Director of the Moscow Architecture Museum. In the autumn of 1989 he visited the Bremen Kunsthalle and reported to the chairman of the Art Society that he had the time to get two paintings and 362 drawings out of Castle Karnzow and had handed them over to the Schtschusev State Research and Science Museum for safekeeping. In the following years he tried repeatedly to return the artwork to the Bremen Art Society by appealing to the highest authorities of the [[USSR]], but without success. The whole issue of "[[looted art]]" from Germany was still taboo at that time. In 1995, a show named after him was held in the Hermitage collection in St. Petersburg. In February 2003, the then Russian Minister of Culture, after a formal request of the Kunstverein in 2000, provided a written commitment that the Baldin Collection should be returned to Bremen. Although the collection is not covered by the Plundered Art Laws, the Russian State Duma has so far refused to return it.

'''Langa Education Assistance Program (LEAP)''', also known as '''LEAP Science and Maths Schools''', is a collection of six non-fee payment secondary education schools located in three provinces in [[South Africa]]. The first LEAP school opened in 2004 in rented premises in Observatory, [[Cape Town]] and served mainly, learners from the [[township]] of [[Langa, Cape Town|Langa]].&lt;ref name="History of LEAP"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://leapschool.org.za/history-of-leap/|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20141110010101/http://leapschool.org.za/history%2Dof%2Dleap/|title = History of LEAP|accessdate = 10 November 2014|archivedate=10 November 2014|dead-url = yes|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an independent school, LEAP is mainly founded by South African Corporates with limited subsidies from the [[South African Department of Education|Department of Basic Education]].

==History==

===Langa Education Assistance Program (or LEAP) ===

John Gilmour was a teacher at [[Pinelands High School]]&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; in Cape Town in 1987 when he decided to respond to a call from individuals within the South African business community, to contribute to the redress of the devastation of the [[Bantu Education Act]],&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; a segregation law imposed in the education sector by the [[Apartheid]] system in 1953.

“Africa Week” was then introduced by a team led by John Gilmour to bring black learners under the “Bantu Education” system to spend a week at Pinelands High School, which was then a white’s only school. The program became the precursor for the Langa Education Assistance Program (or LEAP) which aimed at providing one hundred black students from the Langa township, with support tuition from Pinelands High teachers in [[English language|English]], [[Maths]] and [[Science]], three afternoons a week.

The prohibitive transport cost of bringing learners from the township schools to Pinelands High School forced the model to be revised. In 1996, it was then decided that instead of learners being bussed in to Pinelands High, teachers will be transported to meet learners in township schools.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

Community members in Langa perceived the new model of LEAP as an attempt of white teachers to “save” black children. Teachers from the community felt that they were as able as other teachers to provide extra lessons that would address the inadequacies in the students' educational foundations.  The uneasiness within the community obliged the leadership of LEAP to change the model and include community teachers in the program.

When John Gilmour realised that despite best efforts of LEAP and similar programs in the country there was no increase in the proportion of black learners entering university, especially science-based disciplines, he sought for an alternative model. LEAP Science and Maths school was the alternative model.

===LEAP Science and Maths School===

LEAP Science and Maths school was a deliberate decision of John Gilmour seeking to increase the number of black learners who take science and maths-based modules at high school in order to increase the chance of being accepted at University, particular in disciplines where these modules are a prerequisite.&lt;ref name="A Leap in the dark"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Terblanche|first1=Barry|title=A leap in the dark|publisher=Mail and Guardian|date=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John resigned as Headmaster of Abbot’s College in 2004, where he has been since he left Pinelands in 1997, to focus on LEAP Science and Maths School.  In January 2004, the first LEAP Science and Maths School opened its doors in the suburb of Observatory, Cape Town, with seventy-two learners, seven teachers and one administrative staff member.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

===Expansion of the LEAP model===

====LEAP 1====

The LEAP Science and Maths school, which started in Observatory later moved to Pinelands and become known as LEAP 1. It serves learners from community of Langa Township. It is the first and oldest of the LEAP Science and Maths schools.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; The school is headed by its Operation Leader Oscar Dlodlo.

====LEAP 2====

LEAP 2 opened in 2007 also in Pinelands. It serves learners from the townships of Gugulethu and Crossroads. In 2013, the school opened satellite classes to serve grade 9 and 10 learners from the township of Delft. Learners of the school are taught in English and [[isiXhosa]]. The head of the school is Mr. Babele Emedi, who also assumes the role of Operations Leader.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

====LEAP 3====

The school opened its doors in 2008 to serve learners from the township of Alexandra in [[Johannesburg]].  Learners are taught in [[English language|English]], [[isiZulu]], [[Sepedi]] and [[Sesotho]] under the leadership of the Operations leader, Mr. Mark Fletcher.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

====LEAP 4====

This school is situated in the township of [[Diepsloot]] just outside Johannesburg. The school opened in 2011 through a partnership with the South Africa corporate Aveng Group.&lt;ref name="Aveng Group Projects"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aveng Group Projects|url=http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|website=http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|publisher=Aveng Group|accessdate=10 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003105051/http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|archivedate=3 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; LEAP 4 teaches learners in isiZulu and [[Sepedi]] as home languages, along with English.  Paul Mumba, is the Operations Leader and head of LEAP 4.

====LEAP 5====

In 2012, LEAP 5 opened its doors in Jane Furse, [[Sekhukhune District Municipality|Sekhukhune]] in [[Limpopo]] province. The school is under the leadership of its Operation Leader, Raphael Mukachi.

====LEAP 6====

LEAP 6 is situated in [[Ga-Rankuwa]] near [[Pretoria]]. The school opened in 2012 to respond to the request of the Anglican Diocese of Pretoria, concerned with the community’s poor educational results and high unemployment rate, particularly among young people. The school is led by its Operation Leader, Lawrence Manyesa.

==Vision==

“We strive for the positive transformation of communities through the meaningful education of children from those communities”&lt;ref name="About LEAP"&gt;{{cite web|title=About LEAP|url=http://leapschool.org.za/aboutleap/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/aboutleap/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

“LEAP schools provide student-centered, math’s and science-focused education to economically disadvantaged students from grades 8 to 12. We focus on enabling the self-awareness necessary for each student’s growth to healthy adulthood, and to ensuring optimal academic results which will allow for choices for lifelong learning and a fulfilling future.”&lt;ref name= "About LEAP" /&gt;

== Values and focus==

Although LEAP schools focus on Maths and Sciences; it puts a lot of emphasis on the emotional [[child development|development]] of learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dugger|first1=Celia W|title=New Schools in South Africa Serve the Underserved|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/world/africa/09safrica.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=3&amp;|accessdate=10 November 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=8 September 2010|ref=New Schools in South Africa Serve the Underserved}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Gilmour acknowledged the importance of the emotional development in a country where “eight million children come from single-parent households and a further 4.3 million reside with neither biological parent”.  In his article “A tale of two systems”, he speaks of LEAP’s response to this problem “has been to recognise that social transformation starts with personal transformation:  one person at a time, one room at a time, one school at a time and one community at a time.”&lt;ref name="A tale of two systems"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilmour|first1=John|title=A tale of two systems|url=http://leapschool.org.za/2012/02/12/a-tail-of-two-systems/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school cherishes the following values:
*Being kind, honest and healthy
*Being punctual and looking good
*Working hard and never giving up
*Admitting and learning from mistakes
*Confronting issues and being open to change
*Working together and sharing

== Success stories==

===Statistics===

In a report that analyses the performance of the school between 2005 and 2013, LEAP reported that:

*Its grade 12 learners have achieved a 93% pass rate within the reporting period.
*600 learners passed the National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations commonly known as “matric”
*77% qualified for study at academic and technical universities with a bachelor or diploma pass.&lt;ref name=Success&gt;{{cite web|title=Success|url=http://leapschool.org.za/success/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/success/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school claims to outperform national statistics when it compares itself with national averages of learners who write maths and science in 2013. All LEAP learners wrote these modules compared to only 43% who took maths and 33% who took physical science nationally.&lt;ref name="LEAP Annual Report 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=LEAP Annual Report 2013|url=http://leapschool.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LEAP_AnnualReport2013.pdf|website=http://leapschool.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LEAP_AnnualReport2013.pdf|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduates===

He graduated with a bachelor in [[Bachelor of Commerce]] in Finance from the [[University of the Western Cape]]. In its 2012 annual report, the school reported to have over 30 university graduates ranging from physiotherapist, engineer to accountants.

===Celebratory adverts===

In 2014, LEAP launched a series of celebratory adverts to showcase its work and celebrate the achievements of its past students. Qondisa Nxganga, a Master’s graduate from the prestigious [[African Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] (AIMS), is featured in these adverts alongside a number of other LEAP alumni.&lt;ref name="Celebrating LEAP Alumni"&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating LEAP Alumni|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPYGiXxlQCo|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=LEAP Science &amp; Maths School|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===

LEAP’s model is based on strong engagement with the broader community and building beneficial partnerships and collaboration with other organizations, particular schools. It is a three-way collaboration approach where each LEAP school partners with a more privileged school as well as a less privileged school (a township school) in the community where it operates to promote a culture of shared resources and cultural exchange&lt;ref name=Schools&gt;{{cite web|title=Schools|url=http://leapschool.org.za/schools/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/schools/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LEAP has also been successful in building strong partnerships with both commercial and non-profit organizations. Most of its funding comes from South African corporates, trusts and Foundations.

LEAP, is Teach with Africa’s partner on the continent and together they have established the Teacher Institute which seeks to develop teachers and supports individuals wanting to enter the teaching profession&lt;ref name="Teach for Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Teach for Africa|url=http://www.teachwithafrica.org/what-we-do/our-in-country-partners/|website=http://www.teachwithafrica.org/what-we-do/our-in-country-partners/|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leading and lagging current''' are phenomena that occur as a result of [[alternating current]]. In a circuit with alternating current, the value of voltage and current vary sinusoidally. In these types of circuits, the terms lead, lag, or in phase are used to describe current with reference to voltage. Current is in phase with voltage when there is no [[phase shift]] between the sinusoids describing their time varying behavior. This generally occurs when the load drawing the current is resistive.

In electric power flow, it is important to know whether current is leading or lagging because it can be used to describe how much circulating [[reactive power]] flow is occurring in the system, and whether that power is inductive or capacitive. It can also play an important role in the operation of three-phase power systems.

==Angle notation==
[[Angle notation]] can easily describe leading and lagging current:

&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A \angle \theta.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

In this equation, the value of theta is the important factor for leading and lagging current. As mentioned in the introduction above, leading or lagging current represents a time shift between the current and voltage sine curves, which is represented by the angle by which the curve is ahead or behind of where it would be initially. For example, if θ is zero, the curve will have amplitude zero at time zero.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Electric Power Systems: A Conceptual Introduction|last = von Meier|first = Alexandra|publisher = [[Wiley-Interscience]]|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 49–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[complex number]]s is a way to simplify analyzing certain components in [[RLC circuits]]. For example, it is very easy to convert these between polar and rectangular coordinates. Starting from the polar notation, &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\angle \theta &lt;/math&gt; can represent either the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; or the rectangular notation &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta + j \sin \theta = e^{j\theta},\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; both of which have magnitudes of 1.

==Lagging current==
&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A \angle \theta =A \angle \delta - (\beta)&lt;/math&gt;

Lagging current can be formally defined as “an alternating current that reaches its maximum value up to 90 degrees later than the voltage that produces it.” This means that current lags the voltage when &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, the angle of the current sine wave with respect to an arbitrarily chosen reference, is less than &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, the angle of the voltage sine wave with respect to the same reference. Therefore, current can quickly be identified as lagging if the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is positive. For example, if the voltage angle &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is zero, current will be lagging if &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is negative. This is often the case because voltage is taken as the reference.

In circuits with primarily inductive loads, current lags the voltage. This happens because in an inductive load, it is the induced electromotive force that causes the current to flow. Note that in the definition above, the current is produced by the voltage. The induced electromotive force is caused by a change in the magnetic flux linking the coils of an inductor.

==Leading current==

&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A \angle \theta =A \angle \delta - (\beta)&lt;/math&gt;

Leading current can be formally defined as “an alternating current that reaches its maximum value up to 90 degrees ahead of the voltage that it produces.” This means that the current leads the voltage when &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, the angle of the current sine wave with respect to an arbitrarily chosen reference is greater than &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, the angle of the voltage sine wave with respect to the same reference. Therefore, current can quickly be identified as leading if the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is negative. For example, if the voltage angle &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is zero, current will be leading if &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is positive. This is often the case because voltage is taken as the reference.

In circuits with primarily capacitive loads, current leads the voltage. This is true because current must first flow to the two plates of the capacitor, where charge is stored. Only after charge accumulates at the plates of a capacitor is a voltage difference established. The behavior of the voltage is thus dependent on the behavior current and on how much charge accumulates. This is why the formal definition states that the current produces the voltage.

==Visualizing leading and lagging current==
A simple [[phasor]] diagram with a two dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate]] system and phasors can be used to visualize leading and lagging current at a fixed moment in time. In the real-complex coordinate system, one
period of a sine wave corresponds to a full circle in the complex plane. Since
the voltage and current have the same frequency, at any moment in time those
quantities can be easily represented by stationary points on the circle, while
the arrows from the center of circle to those points are called phasors. Since
the relative time difference between functions is constant, they also have a
constant angle difference between them, represented by the angle between points
on the circle. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Historical documents regarding leading and lagging currents==
An early source of data is an article from the 1911 [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] by A.E. Kennelly.  Kennelly uses traditional methods in solving vector diagrams for oscillating circuits, which can also include alternating current circuits as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">'''Louis-Hugues Vincent''' (31 August 1872 - 30 December 1960) was a French [[Archeologist]], [[monk]] of the [[Dominican Order]], who was educated at Jerusalem's [[École Biblique]]. He undertook important archaeological research in [[Palestine (region)]], primarily during the [[Mandatory Palestine]] period.

==Biography==
He was born in 1872 in [[Isère]] in the commune of [[Vernioz]], near [[Lyon]]. Immediately after his Dominican [[Novitiate]] training, in 1891, he was sent to Jerusalem at the Biblical School ("[[École Biblique]]") of [[St. Stephen's Basilica, Jerusalem|St. Stephen's Basilica]], founded a year before by [[Joseph-Joseph Lagrange]]. Vincent remained there all his life, with the exception of long stays in France during the World Wars.
 
At the École Biblique, Louis Vincent studied and was ordained a Catholic priest. Soon he became one of the most learned scholars in the field of biblical archeology, including ceramics and ancient objects, lecturing on archeology at the school. He came to know all the archaeological sites in the Holy Land.

He carried out excavations with Father [[Roland de Vaux]] in [[Tirzah (ancient city)|Tirzah]], now in the [[West Bank]].

He published many articles in the ''[[Revue Biblique]]'' journal, of which he was the editor-in-chief between 1931 and 1938.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15913">In [[astrophysics]], the '''mass–luminosity relation''' is an equation giving the relationship between a star's mass and its [[luminosity]], first noted by [[Jakob Karl Ernst Halm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuiper|first=G.P.|date=1938|title=The Empirical Mass-Luminosity Relationship|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=88|pages=472–506|bibcode = 1938ApJ....88..472K |doi = 10.1086/143999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship is represented by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} = \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^a&lt;/math&gt;
where ''L''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; are the luminosity and mass of the Sun and 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;ref name="evolutionofstars"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salaris|first=Maurizio|author2=Santi Cassisi|title=Evolution of stars and stellar populations |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|date=2005|pages=138–140|isbn=0-470-09220-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r1dNzr8viRYC&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=Mass-Luminosity%20relation&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.5 is commonly used for [[main sequence|main-sequence]] stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Astro/herrus.html#c3|title=Mass-luminosity relationship|publisher=Hyperphysics|accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This equation and the usual value of ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.5 only applies to main-sequence stars with masses 2''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;55''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; and does not apply to red giants or white dwarfs.  As a star approaches the [[Eddington Luminosity]] then ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

In summary, the relations for stars with different ranges of mass are, to a good approximation, as the following:&lt;ref name="evolutionofstars"/&gt;&lt;ref name="advanced"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Neb Duric|Duric]]|first=[[Neb Duric|Nebojsa]]|title=Advanced astrophysics|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=2004|pages=19|isbn=978-0-521-52571-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ljdYMmI0EIC&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;ots=VdMUIiCdP_&amp;dq=Mass-luminosity%20relation&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jila.colorado.edu/~pja/astr3730/lecture18.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} \approx 0.23\left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{2.3}   \qquad (M &lt; 0.43M_{\odot})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} = \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^4   \qquad\qquad      (0.43M_{\odot} &lt; M &lt; 2M_{\odot})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} \approx 1.4\left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{3.5}   \qquad (2M_{\odot} &lt; M &lt; 20M_{\odot})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} \approx 32000 \frac{M}{M_{\odot}}   \qquad \qquad (M &gt; 55M_{\odot})&lt;/math&gt;

For stars with masses less than 0.43''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, [[convection]] is the sole energy transport process, so the relation changes significantly. For stars with masses ''M''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;55''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; the relationship flattens out and becomes ''L''&amp;nbsp;∝&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;ref name="evolutionofstars"/&gt; but in fact those stars don't last because they are unstable and quickly lose matter by intense solar winds. It can be shown this change is due to an increase in [[radiation pressure]] in massive stars.&lt;ref name="evolutionofstars"/&gt; These equations are determined empirically by determining the mass of stars in binary systems to which the distance is known via standard parallax measurements or other techniques. After enough stars are plotted, stars will form a line on a logarithmic plot and slope of the line gives the proper value of ''a''.

Another form, valid for K-type main-sequence stars, that avoids the discontinuity in the exponent has been given by Cuntz &amp; Wang;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cuntz|first=M.|author2=Wang, Zh. | date=2018|title=The Mass–Luminosity Relation for a Refined Set of Late-K/M Dwarfs|journal=Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society|volume=2 |issue=1|bibcode = 2018RNAAS...2a..19C|doi = 10.3847/2515-5172/aaaa67}}&lt;/ref&gt; it reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}}  \approx \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{a(M)}   \qquad\qquad      (0.20M_{\odot} &lt; M &lt; 0.85M_{\odot})&lt;/math&gt;
with 
:&lt;math&gt;a(M) = -141.7 \cdot M^4 + 232.4 \cdot M^3 - 129.1 \cdot M^2 + 33.29 \cdot M + 0.215&lt;/math&gt;
(''M'' in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;).  This relation is based on data by Mann and collaborators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mann|first=A. W.| author2=Gaidos, E.|author3=Ansdell, M.|date=2013|title=Spectro-thermometry of M Dwarfs and Their Candidate Planets: Too Hot, Too Cool, or Just Right?|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=779 |issue=2|id=188 (15 pages)|bibcode = 2013ApJ...779..188M|doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/779/2/188|arxiv=1311.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt; who used moderate-resolution spectra of nearby late-K and M dwarfs with known parallaxes and interferometrically determined radii to refine their effective temperatures and luminosities. Those stars have also been used as a calibration sample for [[Kepler mission|Kepler]] candidate objects. Besides avoiding the discontinuity in the exponent at ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.43''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, the relation also recovers ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4.0 for ''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8771;&amp;nbsp;0.85''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;.

The mass/luminosity relation is important because it can be used to find the distance to [[Binary system (astronomy)|binary system]]s which are too far for normal [[parallax]] measurements, using a technique called "[[dynamical parallax]]".&lt;ref name="double"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mullaney|first=James|title=Double and multiple stars and how to observe them|publisher=Springer|date=2005|isbn=1-85233-751-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OM3hozlKt9AC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;ots=da06NVpIY_&amp;dq=Mass-Luminosity%20relation%20distance%20binary&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this technique, the masses of the two stars in a binary system are estimated, usually as being the mass of the Sun. Then, using [[Kepler's laws]] of [[celestial mechanics]], the distance between the stars is calculated. Once this distance is found, the distance away can be found via the arc subtended in the sky, giving a preliminary distance measurement. From this measurement and the [[apparent magnitude]]s of both stars, the luminosities can be found, and by using the mass–luminosity relationship, the masses of each star. These masses are used to re-calculate the separation distance, and the process is repeated. The process is iterated many times, and accuracies as high as 5% can be achieved.&lt;ref name="double"/&gt; The mass/luminosity relationship can also be used to determine the lifetime of stars by noting that lifetime is approximately proportional to M/L although one finds that more massive stars have shorter lifetimes than what the M/L relationship predicts. A more sophisticated calculation factors in a star's loss of mass over time.

==Derivation==
Deriving a theoretically exact mass/luminosity relation requires finding the energy generation equation and building a thermodynamic model of the inside of a star. However, the basic relation ''L''&amp;nbsp;∝&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; can be derived using some basic physics and simplifying assumptions.&lt;ref name="physicsofstars"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=A.C.|title=The Physics of Stars|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=1999|isbn=978-0-471-98798-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first such derivation was performed by astrophysicist [[Arthur Eddington]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lecchini|first=Stefano|title=How Dwarfs Became Giants. The Discovery of the Mass-Luminosity Relation|isbn=978-3-9522882-6-9|publisher=Bern Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science|url=http://philoscience.unibe.ch/bern-studies/how-dwarfs-became-giants-the-discovery-of-the-mass-luminosity-relation}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The derivation showed that stars can be approximately modelled as ideal gases, which was a new, somewhat radical idea at the time. What follows is a somewhat more modern approach based on the same principles.

An important factor controlling the luminosity of a star (energy emitted per unit time) is the rate of energy dissipation through its bulk. Where there is no [[heat convection]], this dissipation happens mainly by photons diffusing. By integrating [[Fick%27s_laws_of_diffusion#Fick's_first_law|Fick's first law]] over the surface of some radius ''r'' in the [[radiation zone]] (where there is neglible convection), we get the total outgoing energy flux which is equal to the luminosity by [[conservation of energy]]:
::&lt;math&gt;L = -4\pi\,r^2 D\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}&lt;/math&gt;
Where ''D'' is the photons [[diffusion coefficient]], and ''u'' is the energy density.

Note that this assumes that the star is not fully convective, and that all heat creating processes ([[nucleosynthesis]]) happen in the core, below the radiation zone. These two assumptions are not correct in [[red giant]]s, which do not obey the usual mass-luminosity relation. Stars of low mass are also fully convective, hence do not obey the law.

Approximating the star by a [[black body]], the energy density is related to the temperature by [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]] by:
::&lt;math&gt;U = \frac{4}{c} \, \sigma_B \, T^4 &lt;/math&gt;
where
::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_B = \frac{2 \pi^5 k_B^4 }{15 c^2 h^3} = \frac{\pi^2 k_B^4}{60 \hbar^3 c^2}. &lt;/math&gt;
is the [[Stefan-Boltzmann constant]], ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck constant]].

As in the [[Diffusion#Elementary_theory_of_diffusion_coefficient_in_gases|elementary theory of diffusion coefficient in gases]], the diffusion coefficient ''D'' approximately satisfies:
::&lt;math&gt; D = \frac{1}{3}c\,\lambda &lt;/math&gt;
where &amp;lambda; is the photon [[mean free path]].

Since matter is fully ionized in the star core (as well as where the temperature is of the same order of magnitude as inside the core), photons collide mainly with electrons, and so &amp;lambda; [[Mean_free_path#Derivation|satisfies]] 
::&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{1}{n_e\sigma_{e\cdot\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; is the electron density and:
::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{e\cdot\gamma} = \frac{8\pi}{3}\left(\frac{\alpha\hbar c}{m_ec^2}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
is the cross section for electron-photon scattering, equal to [[Thomson scattering|Thomson cross-section]]. &amp;alpha; is the [[fine-structure constant]] and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; the electron mass.

The average stellar electron density is related to the star mass ''M'' and radius ''R''
::&lt;math&gt;\langle n_e \rangle = \frac{M}{m_e 4\pi R^3/3}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, by the [[virial theorem]], the total kinetic energy is equal to half the gravitational potential energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;, so if the average nuclei mass is ''m''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, then the average kinetic energy per nucleus satisfies:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2}k_B T = \frac{1}{2}E_G\frac{m_n}{M} = C\frac{3}{10}\frac{G M m_n}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
where the temperature ''T'' is averaged over the star and ''C'' is a factor of order one related to the stellar structure and can be estimated from the star approximate [[polytrope|polytropic index]].
Note that this does not hold for large enough stars, where the radiation pressure is larger than the gas pressure in the radiation zone, hence the relation between temperature, mass and raidus is different, as elaborated below.

Wrapping up everything, we also take ''r'' to be equal to ''R'' up tp a factor, and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; at ''r'' is replaced by its stellar average up to a facotr. The combined factor is approximately 1/15 for the sun, and we get:
:&lt;math&gt;L = -4\pi\,r^2 D\frac{\partial u}{\partial r} \approx 4\pi\,R^2 D\frac{u}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;L \approx  \frac{1}{15}\frac{64\pi^2}{9}\frac {\sigma_B}{\sigma_{e\cdot\gamma}}\frac{R^4 T^4}{M}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \approx  \frac{1}{15}\frac{2\pi^3}{9\cdot5^5}\frac {G^4\,m_e^2\,m_n^5}{\alpha^2\hbar^5}\,M^3 = 4\cdot {10^{26}}_W \,\left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^3&lt;/math&gt;

The added factor is actually dependent on ''M'', therefore the law has an approximate &lt;math&gt;M^{3.5}&lt;/math&gt; dependence.

==Distinguishing between small and large stellar masses==
{{Main|Eddington luminosity}}
One may distinguish between the cases of small and large stellar masses by deriving the above results using radiation pressure. In this case, it is easier to use the optical opacity &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; and to consider the internal temperature T&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; directly; more precisely, one can consider the average temperature in the [[radiation zone]].

The consideration begins by noting the relation between the [[radiation pressure]] P&lt;sub&gt;rad&lt;/sub&gt; and luminosity. The gradient of radiation pressure is equal to the momentum transfer absorbed from the radiation, giving:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP_{rad}}{dr} = -\frac {\kappa\rho}{c}\frac{L}{4\pi r^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where c is the velocity of light. Here, &lt;math&gt;1/\kappa\rho = l&lt;/math&gt;; the photon mean free path.

The radiation pressure is related to the temperature by &lt;math&gt;P_{rad} = \frac{4\sigma}{3c}{T_I}^4&lt;/math&gt;, therefore

&lt;math&gt;{T_I}^3\frac{dT_I}{dr} = -\frac {3\kappa\rho}{16\sigma}\frac{L}{4\pi r^2},&lt;/math&gt;

from which it follows directly that

&lt;math&gt;L \varpropto {T_I}^4 \frac {R}{\rho}  \varpropto {T_I}^4  \frac {R^4}{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the radiation zone gravity is balanced by the pressure on the gas coming from both itself (approximated by ideal gas pressure) and from the radiation. For a small enough stellar mass the latter is negligible and one arrives at

&lt;math&gt;T_I \varpropto \frac {M}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

as before. More precisely, since integration was done from 0 to R so &lt;math&gt;T_I-T_E&lt;/math&gt; on the left side, but the surface temperature T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; can be neglected with respect to the internal temperature T&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;.

From this it follows directly that

&lt;math&gt;L \varpropto M^3.&lt;/math&gt;

For a large enough stellar mass, the radiation pressure is larger than the gas pressure in the radiation zone. Plugging in the radiation pressure, instead of the ideal gas pressure used above, yields

&lt;math&gt;{T_I}^4\varpropto \frac{M^2}{R^4},&lt;/math&gt;

hence

&lt;math&gt;L \varpropto M.&lt;/math&gt;

==Core and surface temperatures==

To the first approximation, stars are [[black body]] radiators with a surface area of 4''πR''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, from the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]], the luminosity is related to the surface temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, and thrught it to the [[Color temperature|color]] of the star, by
:&lt;math&gt;L = 4\pi R^2\sigma_B T_S^4&lt;/math&gt;
where ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Stefan-Boltzmann constant]], 5.67&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;8&lt;/sup&gt;W m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

The luminosity is equal to the total energy produced by the star per unit time. Since this energy is produced by nucleosynthesis, usually in the star core (this is not true for [[red giant]]s), the core temperature is related to the luminosity by the [[Stellar nucleosynthesis#Reaction rate|nucleosynthesis rate]] per unit volume:
::&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{dE}{dt} \approx  \epsilon \, \frac{4\pi}{3} R^3 \, n_A \, n_B  \, \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3 m_R}}\, \sqrt{E_0(T)} \frac{S(E_0(T))}{kT} e^{-\frac{3E_0(T)}{kT}}  &lt;/math&gt;
Here, &amp;epsilon; is the total energy emitted in the [[proton-proton chain reaction|chain reaction]] or [[CNO cycle|reaction cycle]]. &lt;math&gt;E_0 = \left(\sqrt{E_G}\,kT/2\right)^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gamow peak]] energy, dependent on ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Gamow factor]]. Additionally, ''S''(''E'')/E is the reaction cross section, ''n'' is number density, &lt;math&gt;m_R = m_A\cdot m_B/(m_A+m_B)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced mass]] for the particle collision, and ''A'',''B'' are the two species participating in the limiting reaction (e.g. both stand for a proton in the [[proton-proton chain reaction]], or ''A'' a proton and ''B'' an {{nuclide|nitrogen|14|link=yes}} nucleus for the [[CNO cycle]]).

Since the radius ''R'' is itself a function of the temperature and the mass, one may solve this equation to get the core temperature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13249">'''Meta-reference''' is a special type of [[self-reference]] that can occur in all media or medial artefacts, for instance literature, film, painting, TV series, comic strips, or video games. It includes all references to, or comments on, a specific medium, medial artefact, or the media in general. These references and comments originate from a logically higher level (a 'meta-level') within any given artefact, and draw attention to -- or invite reflection about -- media-related issues (e.g. the production, performance, or reception) of said artefact, specific other artefacts (as in [[parody]]), or to parts, or the entirety, of the medial system. It is, therefore, the recipient's awareness of an artefact's medial quality that distinguishes meta-reference from more general forms of [[self-reference]]. Thus, meta-reference triggers media-awareness within the recipient, who, in turn "becomes conscious of both the medial (or 'fictional' in the sense of artificial and, sometimes in addition, 'invented') status of the work" as well as "the fact that media-related phenomena are at issue, rather than (hetero-)references to the world outside the media."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies.|last=Wolf|first=Werner|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although certain devices, such as [[Mise en abyme (in literature and other media)|mise en abyme]], may be conducive to meta-reference, they are not necessarily metareferential themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Wolf|first=Werner|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, innately metareferential devices, such as [[metalepsis]], are to be seen as special cases of meta-reference. The terms meta-reference and [[metalepsis]] can, therefore, not be used synonymously.

== History of the concept and the term ==
While meta-reference as a concept is not a new phenomenon and can be observed in very early works of art and media not tied to specific purposes (e.g. Homer's invocation of the muses at the beginning of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' in order to deliver the epic better), the term itself is relatively new.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Werner|first=Wolf|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier discussions of metareferential issues often opt for more specific terminology tied to the respective discipline. Notable discussions of meta-reference include, but are not limited to, William H. Gass's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fiction and the Figures of Life|last=Gass|first=William|publisher=Knopf|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Scholes's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scholes|first=Robert|date=1970|title=Metafiction|url=|journal=Iowa Review|volume=1|pages=100-115|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; exploration of [[metafiction]], Victor Stoichita's examination of early modern meta-painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Self-Aware Image.

In the context of drama, meta-reference has also become colloquially known as the breaking of the [[fourth wall]]. The first study to underscore the problem resulting from the lack of cohesive terminology, as well as the necessity to acknowledge metareference as transmedial and trans-generic phenomenon, was published in 2007 by Hauthal et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/155834217|title=Metaisierung in Literatur und anderen Medien : theoretische Grundlagen, historische Perspektiven, Metagattungen, Funktionen|date=2007|publisher=De Gruyter|others=Hauthal, Janine.|isbn=3110199459|location=Berlin|oclc=155834217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publications by Nöth and Bishara&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/471132600|title=Self-reference in the media|date=2007|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|others=Bishara, Nina, 1977-, Nöth, Winfried.|isbn=3110194643|location=Berlin|oclc=471132600}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Wolf&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/436342321|title=Metareference across media : theory and case studies|date=2009|publisher=Rodopi|others=Wolf, Werner, 1955-, Bantleon, Katharina., Thoss, Jeff., Bernhart, Walter.|isbn=9789042026704|location=Amsterdam|oclc=436342321}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed suit, raised similar concerns, included case studies from various media, coined and helped establish the more uniform umbrella term meta-reference as define above.

== Examples ==
While every medium has the potential for meta-reference, some media can transport meta-reference more easily than others. Media that can easily realise its meta-referential potential includes, for instance, literature, painting, and film. Although music can be meta-referential even outside the confines of lyrics, meta-reference in music is much harder to create or detect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Michaelsen|first=René|date=|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|editor-last=Wolf|editor-first=Werner|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=235-259|chapter=Exploring Metareference in Instrumental Music -- The Case of Robert Schumann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Self-Reference in the Media|last=Wolf|first=Werner|date=|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|year=2007|isbn=978-3-11-019464-7|editor-last=Nöth|editor-first=Winfried|location=Berlin|pages=303-325|chapter=Metafiction and Metamusic: Exploring the Limits of Metareference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music, therefore, would be a less typical medium for the occurrence of meta-reference. Nöth argues in this context that although non-verbal media can be the home of meta-reference, the contained meta-reference can only be implicit because non-verbal media can only show similarites, but never point directly (or explicitly) to meta-referential elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Nöth|first=Winfried|date=|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|editor-last=Wolf|editor-first=Werner|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=889-121|chapter=Metareference from a Semiotic Perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, argue that meta-reference is explicit as long as it is clear.

=== Literature ===
John Fowles begins chapter 13 of his novel ''The French Lieutenant's Woman'' with the words&lt;blockquote&gt;This ''story'' I am ''telling'' is all ''imagination''. These ''characters'' I create never existed outside my own mind. If I have pretended until now to know my ''characters''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' mind and innermost thoughts, it is because I am ''writing'' in [...] a ''convention'' universally accepted at the time of my ''story'': that the ''novelist'' stands next to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The French Lieutenant's Woman|last=Fowels|first=John|publisher=Vintage|year=2005|isbn=978-0-099-49707-3|location=London|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; [emphases added]&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is an example of explicit meta-reference because the text draws attention to the fact that the novel the recipient is reading is merely a fiction created by the author. It also foregrounds the convention that readers of realist fiction accept the presence of an all-knowing narrator, and breaks it by allowing the narrator to take centre stage which invites meta-reflections by the recipient.

=== Film ===
''[[The Truman Show]]'' is a movie that contains a high degree of meta-reference. Truman, the protagonist, is unaware that he is part of a reality TV show, but the audience knows about the artificiality of both Truman's life and, by extension, the movie that is being watched. This is underscored by putting emphasis on the production process of the fictional reality TV show, which makes the audience aware of the same features being used in the movie at the time of watching. Further examples of meta-reference in the movie include spotlights falling from the sky seemingly out of the blue, or a raincloud which is curiously only raining on Truman following him around on Seahaven Beach. Both instances point to the artificiality of Truman's life as well as the film itself.

=== Painting ===
[[File:Edouard Manet - The Balcony - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|214x214px|
Manet, ''The Balcony''
]]
An example of meta-reference in painting is ''Manet's Balcony'' by [[René Magritte]]. It comments on another painting, [[The Balcony (painting)|''The Balcony'']] by [[Édouard Manet]], by mimicking both the setting of the balcony as well as the poses of the depicted people, but places them in coffins. Thus, the recipient's attention is drawn to the fact that not only are the people in the painting long dead and only still 'alive' in the representation, but arguably also that the artist ([[Édouard Manet|Manet]]) and the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting style are just as dead as the portrayed individuals. Furthermore, it is foregrounded that the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting style is just a style that may be copied, which further emphasises the fact that both works are only paintings created in a specific way.

[[File:Blotting Compass for Molecular Probes.png|thumb|right|alt=A compass of molecular probes]]

A '''molecular probe''' is a group of [[atoms]] or [[molecules]] used in [[molecular biology]] or [[chemistry]] to study the properties of other molecules or structures. If some measurable property of the molecular probe used changes when it interacts with the [[analyte]] (such as a change in [[absorbance]]), the interactions between the probe and the analyte can be studied. This makes it possible to indirectly study the properties of compounds and structures which may be hard to study directly. The choice of molecular probe will depend on which compound or structure is being studied as well as on what property is of interest. Radioactive [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] sequences are used in [[molecular genetics]] to detect the presence of a [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] sequence by molecular [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?molecular+probes | title = Cancerweb Molecular Probe Definition }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In art and [[iconography]], a '''motif''' {{Audio|en-us-motif.ogg|(pronunciation)}} is an element of an [[image]].  A motif may be repeated in a [[pattern]] or design, often many times, or may just occur once in a work.&lt;ref name=LatinArt&gt;{{cite web |title=Art glossary |url=http://www.latinart.com/glossary.cfm?sort=M |publisher=LatinArt.com |accessdate=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of motif==

A motif may be an element in the iconography of a particular subject or type of subject that is seen in other works, or may form the main subject, as the [[Master of Animals]] motif in ancient art typically does. The related motif of [[confronted animals]] is often seen alone, but may also be repeated, for example in [[Byzantine silk]] and other ancient textiles.  Where the main subject of an artistic work such as a painting is a specific person, group, or moment in a narrative, that should be referred to as the "subject" of the work, not a motif, though the same thing may be a "motif" when part of another subject, or part of a work of [[decorative art]] such as a painting on a vase.

[[Ornament (art)|Ornament]]al or [[decorative art]] can usually be analysed into a number of different elements, which can be called motifs. These may often, as in [[Fiber art|textile art]], be repeated many times in a pattern. Important examples in Western art include [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]], [[egg and dart]],&lt;ref&gt;Lucy T. Shoe, ''Profiles of Greek Mouldings'' 1936, supplemented by Shoe, "Greek Mouldings of Kos and Rhodes", ''Hesperia'' '''19'''.4 (October - December 1950:338-369 and illustrations)&lt;/ref&gt; and various types of [[scrollwork]].

[[File:Elibelinde2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Elibelinde]] [[kilim motifs]], symbolising [[fertility]]]]

Many designs in [[Islamic culture]] are motifs, including those of the sun, moon, animals such as horses and lions, flowers, and landscapes. Motifs can have emotional effects and be used for propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctc.usma.edu/pdf/CTC%20--%20Islamic%20Imagery%20Project.pdf Motifs in Jihadi Internet Propaganda]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[kilim]] flatwoven carpets, [[kilim motifs|motifs]] such as the hands-on-hips [[elibelinde]] are woven in to the design to express the hopes and concerns of the weavers: the elibelinde symbolises the female principle and [[fertility]], including the desire for children.&lt;ref name=Erbek&gt;{{cite book |author=Erbek, Güran |title=Kilim Catalogue No. 1 |publisher =May Selçuk A. S. Edition=1st |date=1998 |pages=4–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IntegrityBarnstar.png|thumb|[[Pennsylvania Dutch]] motif known as a [[hex sign]]]]
Pennsylvania Dutch hex signs are a familiar type of motif in the eastern portions of the United States. Their circular and symmetric design, and their use of brightly colored patterns from nature, such as stars, compass roses, doves, hearts, tulips, leaves, and feathers have made them quite popular. In some parts of Pennsylvania Dutch country, it is common to see these designs decorating barns and covered bridges.

The idea of a motif has become used more broadly in discussing [[literature]] and other narrative arts for [[Motif (narrative)|an element in the story]] that represents a [[theme (arts)|theme]].&lt;ref name="Grayson"&gt;James H.

[[Image:Athen Stoa Ostrakismos 2.jpg|right|thumb|280px|Voting ostraca (for [[ostracism]], Ancient Greece)]]

An '''ostracon''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ὄστρακον}} ''ostrakon'', plural {{lang|grc|ὄστρακα}} ''ostraka'') is a piece of [[pottery]], usually broken off from a [[vase]] or other [[earthenware]] vessel. In an [[archaeology|archaeological]] or [[epigraphy|epigraphical]] context, ''ostraca'' refer to [[sherd]]s or even small pieces of stone that have writing scratched into them. Usually these are considered to have been broken off before the writing was added; ancient people used the cheap, plentiful and durable broken pieces of pottery around them as convenient places to place writing for a wide variety of purposes, mostly very short inscriptions, but in some cases surprisingly long.

==Ostracism==
In [[Classical Athens]], when the decision at hand was to banish or exile a certain member of society, citizen peers would cast their vote by writing the name of the person on the sherd of pottery; the vote was counted and, if unfavorable, the person was [[exile]]d for a period of ten years from the city, thus giving rise to the term ''[[ostracism]]''.

==Egyptian limestone and potsherd ostraca==
[[Image:Heratic script limestone.jpg|right|thumb|210px|One of four official letters to [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] Khay copied onto a [[limestone]] ostracon, in Egyptian [[Hieratic]] ]]

[[File:Egyptian - Ostracon with a Royal Head - Walters 321.jpg|left|thumb|The [[New Kingdom]] [[pharaoh]] depicted on this limestone fragment  bears the finesse of a master's hand. The two arms, however, are rendered more crudely. It is likely that a master used this ostracon to teach his student, and the work of both individuals can be seen on the piece. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].|251x251px]]

Anything with a smooth surface could be used as a writing surface. Generally discarded material, ostraca were cheap, readily available and therefore frequently used  for writings of an ephemeral nature such as messages, prescriptions, receipts, students' exercises and notes: pottery [[sherd]]s, limestone flakes,&lt;ref name="Donadoni"&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Donadoni |editor-first=Sergio |title=The Egyptians |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1997 |isbn=0-226-15555-2 |page=78 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; thin fragments of other stone types, etc., but limestone sherds, being flaky and of a lighter color, were most common. Ostraca were typically small, covered with just a few words or a small picture drawn in ink;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Klauck |first=Hans-Josef |title=Ancient Letters And the New Testament: A Guide to Context and Exegesis |publisher=Baylor University Press |year=2006 |isbn=1-932792-40-6 |page=45 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the tomb of the craftsman Sennedjem at  Deir el Medina contained an enormous ostracon inscribed with the [[Story of Sinuhe]].&lt;ref name="Donadoni" /&gt;

The importance of ostraca for Egyptology is immense. The combination of their physical nature and the Egyptian climate have preserved texts, from the medical to the mundane, which in other cultures were lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Michel |last=Chauveau |title=Egypt in the Age of Cleopatra: History and Society Under the Ptolemies |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |year=2000 |isbn=0-8014-8576-2 |page=7 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; These can often serve as better witnesses of everyday life than literary treatises preserved in libraries.

===Deir el-Medina Medical Ostraca===
{{See also|Medical Ostraca of Deir el-Medina}}
The many ostraca found at [[Deir el-Medina]] provide a deeply compelling view into the medical workings of the [[New Kingdom]]. These ostraca have shown that, like other Egyptian communities, the workmen and inhabitants of Deir el-Medina received care through a combination of [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|medical treatment]], [[Ancient Egyptian religion|prayer]], and  [[Egyptian magic|magic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDowell|2002|p=53 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the records at Deir el-Medina indicate some level of division, as records from the village note both a “[[physician]]” who saw patients and prescribed treatments, and a “scorpion charmer” who specialized in magical cures for scorpion stings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Janssen |first=Jac. J. |title=Absence from Work by the Necropolis Workmen of Thebes |journal=Studien zur Altägyptischen Kultur |volume=8 |year=1980 |issue= |pages=127–152 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ostraca from Deir el-Medina also differed in their circulation. Magical spells and remedies were widely distributed among the workmen; there are even several cases of spells being sent from one worker to another, with no “trained” intermediary.&lt;ref&gt;Lesko, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDowell|2002|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Written medical texts appear to have been much rarer, however, with only a handful of ostraca containing [[Medical prescription|prescriptions]], indicating that the trained physician mixed the more complicated remedies himself. There are also several documents that show the writer sending for medical ingredients, but it is unknown whether these were sent according to a physician’s prescription, or to fulfill a [[home remedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDowell|2002|p=57 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saqqara Dream Ostraca===
From 1964–1971, Bryan Emery excavated at [[Saqqara]] in search of [[Imhotep]]'s tomb; instead, the extensive catacombs of animal mummies were uncovered.  Apparently it was a pilgrim site, with as many as 1½ million [[ibis]] birds interred (as well as cats, dogs, rams, and lions). This 2nd-century BC site contained extensive pottery debris from the site offerings of the pilgrims.

Emery's excavations uncovered the "Dream Ostraca", created by a scribe named ''Hor of Sebennytos.'' A devotee of the god [[Thoth]], he lived adjacent to Thoth's sanctuary at the entrance to the North Catacomb and worked as a "proto-therapist", advising and comforting clients. He transferred his divinely-inspired dreams onto ostraca. The Dream Ostraca are 65 [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] texts written on pottery and limestone.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical period ostraca==
{{See also|List of artifacts significant to the Bible}}

Famous ostraca for [[Biblical archaeology]] have been found at:
* [[Arad, Israel]], or [[Tel Arad]]
* [[Lachish]]
* [[Mesad Hashavyahu]]
* [[Ostraca House]] at [[Samaria]]
* [[Elah Fortress]] at [[Khirbet Qeiyafa]]&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/10/30/israel.ancient.text/ |title=Archeologist finds 3,000-year old Hebrew text |work=CNN |date=October 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, the lots drawn at [[Masada]] are believed to have been ostraca, and some potsherds resembling the lots have been found.

In October 2008, Israeli archaeologist, [[Yosef Garfinkel]] of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], has discovered what he says to be the earliest known Hebrew text. This text was written on an Ostracon shard; Garfinkel believes this shard dates to the time of King David from the Old Testament, about 3,000 years ago. Carbon dating of the Ostracon and analysis of the pottery have dated the inscription to be about 1,000 years older than the Dead Sea Scrolls. The inscription has yet to be deciphered, however, some words, such as king, slave and judge have been translated. 
The shard was found about 20 miles southwest of Jerusalem at the Elah Fortress in Khirbet Qeiyafa, the earliest known fortified city of the biblical period of Israel.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

==Christian ostraca==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2014}}
Some Christian texts are preserved upon ostraca. In the late 19th century, 20 ostraca were found in [[Upper Egypt]], probably from the 7th century, written in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]].

The ostraca are of different sizes and shapes. The more extant is [[Luke 22]]:40-71, which runs over 10 pieces. The ostraca contain from 2 to 9 verses each, and cover {{bibleref|Matthew|27:31–32}}; Mark 5:40-41 (Mark 9:3); Mark 9:17-18, Mark 9:22; Mark 15:21; Luke 12:13-16; Luke 22:40-71; John 1:1-9; John 1:14-17; John 18:19-25; John 19:15-17. There is one ostracon with the inscription "St. Peter the evangelist," perhaps an allusion to the Gospel of Peter.

A Coptic Sa'idic ostracon preserves the [[Pericope Adulterae]] found in John 7:53-8:1, which is otherwise omitted in the Sa'idic New Testament. A Christian hymn to Mary, similar to the canticles of Luke, and some Christian letters have also been found.

Inscriptions on clay, wood, metal, and other hard materials, like [[Papyrus|papyri]], are valuable especially as literary sources for [[Early Christianity]]. They are found chiefly in Oriental countries (i.e. ''east'' of Rome or [[Southwest Asia]]), especially Egypt (which though east of Rome is technically [[North Africa]]). The greatest number are pieces of clay or scraps of pots inscribed with colors or ink. The oldest Christian ostraca, like the papyri, are Greek and date from the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]]; next come the Coptic and Arabian ostraca. Some of the texts not yet deciphered include several Nubian ostraca in a language spoken in the old Christian kingdoms in the vicinity of Aloa on the [[Blue Nile]]. 

In these inscriptions Greek letters are used, with some other signs. As to contents, ostraca are either profane or ecclesiastical. Potsherds were often used for correspondence in place of the less durable papyrus; occasionally the recipient wrote the answer on the back of the potsherd. Ostraca were also used for mercantile purposes, as bills, receipts, etc. C. M. Kaufmann and J. C. Ewald Falls, while excavating the town of Menas in the Libyan desert, discovered ostraca of this class—the oldest Christian potsherds in the Greek language (5th century)—and H. J. Bell and F. G. Kenyon of the British Museum deciphered them. 

They refer to the vine-culture of the sanctuaries of Menas and represent, for the most part, short vouchers for money or provisions. The currency is based upon gold [[solidi]] issued by [[Constantine I|Constantine]]; the date is reckoned by the year of indiction. Of historical interest is the assistance given to invalid workmen, the employment of the lower clergy, the manner of provisioning the workmen, and especially the statements about the harvest periods in the Libyan district. The series of Coptic ostraca which deals with the clergy and the monasteries in the Nile valley is particularly extensive. They refer to all phases of administration and popular life. 

The ecclesiastical ostraca, in a narrow sense, contain Biblical citations from the [[New Testament]], prayers, extracts from the [[synaxaria]] (lives of the saints), and are partly of a liturgic character. Greek, which was then the language of the Church, is much used, with the Coptic. Among the samples published by W.E. Crum, a fine judge of Coptic dialects, there is a local confession of faith from the 6th century, besides the Preface and Sanctus of the Mass, prayers from the [[Liturgy of St. Basil]] and of St. Mark, a part of the [[didascalia]] of [[Schenûte of Athribis]], a Greek confession, and an [[excommunication]], also in Greek.
 
Particularly remarkable are those ostraca which contain liturgical songs. They represent our present song-books for which purpose rolls of papyrus were less suited than the more durable potsherds; in some cases wooden books were used. Among the pieces translated by Crum we find petitions for ordination in which the petitioner promises to learn by heart one of the Gospels, and a reference to an ancient abstinence movement, against which is directed a decree that the consecration-wine should be pure or at least three-fourths pure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1420">The '''pluriblast''' is a [[Pluripotency|pluripotent]] population of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the [[embryogenesis]] of [[marsupial]]s, called the [[inner cell mass]] in [[eutherian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheng | first1 = G | year = 2014 | title = Epiblast morphogenesis before gastrulation | url = | journal = Dev. Biol. | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.10.003i }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pluriblast is distinct from the [[trophoblast]], and gives rise to the [[germ layer]]s of the [[embryo]], as well as extra embryonic [[endoderm]] and extra embryonic [[mesoderm]].  Both the pluriblast and trophoblast arise from the [[Totipotency|totipotent]] cells of the early [[conceptus]].  By definition, the pluriblast does not give rise to trophoblast cells during normal development, although it may retain this potential under experimental conditions.

In [[metatherian]]s ([[marsupial]])s the pluriblast forms part of the blastocyst wall and no structure exists that can be described as an inner cell mass.  "Inner cell mass" is thus a morphological term peculiar to eutherian mammals, whereas "pluriblast" is a functional term more widely applicable to conserved aspects of mammalian development.

'''Promise Theory''', in the context of [[information science]], is a model of voluntary cooperation between individual, [[autonomous agent|autonomous actors or agents]] who publish their intentions to one another in the form of promises. It is a form of labelled graph theory, describing discrete networks of agents joined by the unilateral promises they make.

A '''promise''' is a declaration of intent whose purpose is to increase the recipient's certainty about a claim of past, present or future behaviour.&lt;ref name="Burgess" &gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11568285_9 M. Burgess, An Approach to Understanding Policy Based on Autonomy and Voluntary Cooperation]&lt;/ref&gt; For a promise to increase certainty, the recipient needs to trust the promiser, but trust can also be built on the [[verification theory|verification]] (or '''assessment''') that previous promises have been kept, thus trust plays a symbiotic relationship with promises. Each agent assesses its belief in the promise's outcome or intent. Thus Promise Theory is about the [[wikt:relativity|relativity]] of autonomous agents.

One of the goals of Promise Theory is to offer a model that unifies the physical (or dynamical) description of an information system with its intended meaning, i.e. its [[semantics]]. This has been used to describe [[configuration management]] of resources in information systems, amongst other things.

== History ==

Promise Theory was proposed by [[Mark Burgess (computer scientist)|Mark Burgess]] in 2004, in the context of computer science, in order to solve problems present in obligation-based computer management schemes for [[policy-based management]].&lt;ref name="Burgess" /&gt; However its usefulness was quickly seen to go far beyond computing. The simple model of a promise used in Promise Theory (now called 'micro-promises') can easily address matters of Economics and Organization. Promise Theory has since been developed by Burgess in collaboration with Dutch computer scientist [[Jan Bergstra]], resulting in a book: Promise Theory: Principles and Applications.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Promise-Theory-Principles-Applications-Volume/dp/1495437779/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391713533&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=promise+theory Promise Theory: Principles and Applications]&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2013.

Interest in promise theory has grown in the IT industry, with several products citing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://markburgess.org/TIpromises.html Thinking in Promises, O'Reilly, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/article/2449562/sdn/promise-theory-mark-burgess-cfengine-sdn-cisco-aci-apic-opflex.html Promise Theory: Can you really trust the network to keep promises?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://jmplank.wordpress.com/tag/promise-theory/ ACI Policy Model: Introduction to some of the fundamentals of an ACI Policy and how it’s enforced]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nojitter.com/post/240169790/why-you-need-to-know-about-promise-theory Why you need to know about promise theory]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vmiss.net/infrastructure/opflex-ing-your-cisco-application-centric-infrastructure/ OpFlex-ing Your Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2016/06/chef-just-took-big-step-quest-make-code-work-like-biology/ The Quest to Make Code Work Like Biology Just Took A Big Step (Wired 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Autonomy ==

Obligations, rather than promises have been the traditional way of guiding behaviour.&lt;ref name="ArXiv 3294" &gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3294 [0810.3294&amp;#93; A static theory of promises&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Promise Theory's point of departure from [[Deontological ethics|obligation logics]] is the idea that all agents in a system should have autonomy of control—i.e. that they cannot be coerced or forced into a specific behaviour. Obligation theories in computer science often view an obligation as a deterministic command that causes its proposed outcome. In Promise Theory an agent may only make promises about its own behaviour. For autonomous agents it is meaningless to make promises about another's behaviour.

Although this assumption could be interpreted morally or ethically, in Promise Theory this is simply a pragmatic `engineering' principle, which leads to a more complete documentation of the intended roles of the actors or agents within the whole. The reason for this is that, when one is not allowed to make assumptions about others' behaviour, one is forced to document every promise more completely in order to make predictions; thus it leads to a more complete documentation which in turn points out the possible failure modes by which cooperative behaviour could fail.

Command and control systems like those that motivate obligation theories can easily be reproduced by having agents voluntarily promise to follow the instructions of another agent (this is also viewed as a more realistic model of behaviour). Since a promise can always be withdrawn, there is no contradiction between voluntary cooperation and command and control.

In Philosophy and Law a promise is often viewed as something that leads to an obligation. Promise Theory rejects that point of view. Bergstra and Burgess have shown that the concept of a promise is quite independent of that of obligation and indeed is simpler.&lt;ref name="ArXiv 3294" /&gt;

The role of obligations in increasing certainty is unclear, since obligations can come from anywhere and an aggregation of non-local constraints cannot be resolved by a local agent: this means that obligations can actually increase uncertainty. In a world of promises, all constraints on an agent are self-imposed and local (even if they are suggested by outside agents), thus all contradictions can be resolved locally.

== Multi-agent systems and commitments ==

The theory of commitments in [[multi-agent system]]s has some similarities with aspects of promise theory, but there are key differences. In Promise Theory a commitment is a subset of intentions. Since a promise is a published intention, a commitment may or may not be a promise. A detailed comparison of Promises and Commitments in the senses intended in their respective fields is forthcoming, and not a trivial matter.

== Economics ==

Promises can be valuable to the promisee or even to the promiser. They might also lead to costs. There is thus an economic story to tell about promises. The economics of promises naturally motivate `selfish agent' behaviour and Promise Theory can be seen as a motivation for game theoretical decision making, in which multiple promises play the role of strategies in a game.&lt;ref&gt;http://project.iu.hio.no/papers/pcm.2.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of promises as applied to [[organization]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Laws of Human-Computer Behaviour and Collective Organization}} http://research.iu.hio.no/papers/organization.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; bears some resemblance to the theory of Institutional Diversity by [[Elinor Ostrom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Institutional Diversity |last=Ostrom |first=Elinor |year=2005 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location= |isbn=0-691-12238-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several of the same themes and consideration appear; the main difference is that Ostrom focuses, like many authors, on the role of external rules and obligations. Promise Theory takes the opposite viewpoint that obeyance of rules is a voluntary act and hence it makes sense to focus on those voluntary promises. An attempt to force obeyance without a promise is considered to constitute an attack.
One benefit of a Promise Theory approach is that it does not require special structural elements (e.g. Ostrom's institutional "Positions") to describe different roles in a collaborate network—these may also be viewed as promises in Promise Theory; thus there is a parsimony that helps to avoid an explosion of concepts, and perhaps more importantly admits mathematical formalization. The algebra and calculus of promises allows simple reasoning in a mathematical framework.

== CFEngine ==

In spite of the generality of Promise Theory, it was originally proposed by Burgess as a way of modelling the computer management software [[CFEngine]] and its autonomous behaviour. Existing theories based on obligation were unsuitable. CFEngine uses a model of autonomy both as a way of avoiding distributed inconsistency in policy and as a security principle against external attack: no agent can be forced to receive information or instructions from another agent, thus all cooperation is voluntary. For many users of the software, this property has been instrumental in both keeping their systems safe and adapting to the local requirements.

== Emergent behaviour ==

In [[computer science]], the '''Promise theory''' describes policy governed services, in a framework of completely autonomous agents, which assist one another by voluntary cooperation alone. It is a framework for analyzing realistic models of modern networking, and as a formal model for [[swarm intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Burgess, S. Fagernes (2006), ''Promise theory - a model of autonomous objects for pervasive computing and swarms'', Oslo University College, {{ISBN|0-7695-2622-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promise theory may be viewed as a logical and graph theoretical framework for understanding complex relationships in networks, where many constraints have to be met, which was developed at [[Oslo University College]], by drawing on ideas from several different lines of research conducted there, including policy based management, graph theory, logic and [[configuration management]]. It uses a constructivist approach that builds conventional management structures from graphs of interacting, autonomous agents. Promises can be asserted either from an agent to itself or from one agent to another and each promise implies a constraint on the behavior of the promising agent. The atomicity of the promises makes them a tool for finding contradictions and inconsistencies.

== Agency as a model of systems in space and time ==

The promises made by autonomous agents lead to a mutually approved [[graph (data structure)|graph]] structure, which in turn leads to spatial structures in which the agents represent point-like locations. This allows models of '''smart spaces''', i.e. semantically labeled or even functional spaces, such as databases, knowledge maps, warehouses, hotels, etc., to be unified with other more conventional descriptions of space and time. The model of [[semantic spacetime]] uses promise theory to discuss these spacetime concepts.

Promises are more mathematically primitive than graph adjacencies, since a link requires the mutual consent of two autonomous agents, thus the concept of a connected space requires more work to build structure. This makes them mathematically interesting as a notion of space, and offers a useful way of modeling physical and virtual information systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5563 M. Burgess, Spacetimes with Semantics]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4325">{{Rhetoric}}
'''Pronuntiatio''' was the discipline of delivering [[Public speaking|speeches]] in Western classical [[rhetoric]]. It is one of the five canons of classical rhetoric (the others being [[inventio]], [[dispositio]], [[elocutio]], and [[memoria]]) that concern the crafting and delivery of speeches. In literature the equivalent of ancient ''pronuntiatio'' is the [[recitation]] of [[epic poetry|epics]] (Aris. Po. 26.2.).&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Lausberg, David E. Orton, R. Dean Anderson, ''Handbook of literary rhetoric: a foundation for literary study'', BRILL, 1998, p. 480&lt;/ref&gt;

As with ''memoria'', the canon that dealt with the memorization of speeches, ''pronuntiatio'' was not extensively written about in Classical texts on rhetoric. Its importance declined even more, once the written word became the focus of rhetoric, although after the eighteenth century it again saw more interest in the works of men such as [[Gilbert Austin]].

Rhetoricians laid down guidelines on the use of the voice and gestures (''actio'') in the delivery of oratory. There were instructions on the proper modulation of the voice (volume and pitch), as well as the phrasing, pace, and emphasis of speech. Also covered were the physical aspects of oration: stance, gestures, posture, and facial expressions. There was also the concept of ''exercitatio'' (or practice exercises) that enabled speakers to both memorize their speeches and practice their delivery.

This excerpt from [[Quintilian]]'s ''Institutio oratoria'' provides an example of the types of advice provided by rhetoricians:
:"The head, being the chief member of the body, has a corresponding importance in delivery, serving not merely to produce graceful effect, but to illustrate our meaning as well. To secure grace it is essential that the head should be carried naturally and erect. For a droop suggests humility, while if it be thrown back it seems to express arrogance, if inclined to one side it gives an impression of languor, while if it is held too stiffly and rigidly it appears to indicate a rude and savage temper." (''Institutio oratoria'', XI iii 68-69, translated by H. E. Butler, Loeb Classical Library, 1922)

While the content, structure, and style of oration were (and continue to be) the most important elements of oratory, effective delivery enhances its persuasive power, and poor delivery detracts greatly from its intended effect.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Delivery is based on the technology of the times.
During Cicero's time, delivery was predominantly speaking. Written delivery developed because of the written language, and now delivery is both spoken and written. Technology has taken away the distinctions between written and oral delivery.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}
 
Written discourse did not become important until reading became more common.  Because the ancients did not use punctuation, their writing consisted of one long stream of words called ''scriptio continua''.  
During the editing process, modern rhetors must go through three stages: correctness rule, formatting, and presentation.  
Writers face more problems than speakers because they must be conscious of spelling, punctuation, and grammar.  
Punctuation is useful in written discourse because it marks the end of a thought and allows the reader to pause and process the information.
Visual rhetoric focuses on images and how words function as images.
The delivery of ocular demonstration is the use of words to produce mental images in the audience.  Textual presentation allows the writer to grab the reader's attention before actually reading the text based on the appearance of the text.  The invention of word processors has allowed writers to enhance the appearance of their text and use effects to put emphasis on certain words or thoughts.
''Delivery'' refers not only to written or spoken language, but also to photographs, paintings, or movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowley|first1=Sharon|last2=Hawhee|first2=Debra|title=Ancient Rhetorics for Contemporary Students|date=2004|publisher=Pearson Longman|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of offshore oil fields in the North Sea in the 1970s the use of Sesam for [[Fixed platform|fixed offshore platforms]] grew. Examples of such use are the Ekofisk concrete tank of the [[Ekofisk]] oil field, the [[Condeep]] [[Offshore concrete structure|concrete gravity base structures]] and the Kvitebjørn jacket in the North Sea.

In the late 1970s development of a completely new version of Sesam started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Means |first=Kaia |date=2009 |title=Celebrating Sesam's first 40 years |url=http://www.dnv.com/services/software/publications/2009/no_1/celebratingsesam40.asp |publisher=DNV GL |access-date=2 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This version was released in the mid-1980s under the name SESAM'80 and is the basis for today's Sesam. During the 1990s Sesam was further enhanced with a high-level concept modelling technique together with a design-oriented and unified user interface. Analysis features for mooring systems and flexible risers were also added. The software name was at the same time simplified to merely "Sesam".

The development of the recent years with frequent new releases is focused on improving Sesam as a tool for all phases of offshore and maritime structures from design, through transportation, installation, operation and modification to life extension, requalification and finally decommissioning.

Sesam consists of several modules of which the most important are:

'''GeniE''' for modelling, analysis and code checking of beam, plate and shell structures like offshore platforms and ships.

'''HydroD''' for hydrodynamic and hydrostatic analysis of fixed and floating structures like offshore platforms and ships.

'''Sima''' for simulation of marine operations like lifting and lowering large objects in a marine environment.

'''DeepC''' for mooring and riser design as well marine operations of offshore floating structures.

Sesam is developed in Norway by [[DNV GL]] with focus on solution of structural and hydrodynamic engineering problems within the offshore and maritime industries. It has been used by the offshore and maritime industries world-wide for more than 45 years.

[[File:Singapore Science Centre.jpg|thumb|upright|Entrance of the Science Centre]]
The '''Science Centre Singapore''' ('''SCS''', previously known as '''Singapore Science Centre''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/upload/mid1/type9/cat0/7974_312_Media%20Release%20-%20The%20Singapore%20Science%20Centre%20turns%2030!.pdf The Singapore Science Centre turns 30!]&lt;/ref&gt; is a scientific institution in [[Jurong East]], [[Singapore]], specialising in the promotion of scientific and technological education for the general public. With over 850 exhibits spread over eight exhibition galleries, it sees over a million visitors a year, and over 25 million visitors up to the year 2003 when it celebrated its [[silver jubilee]].

==History==
[[File:Evening aerial view of the Singapore Science Centre - 20050926.jpg|thumb|left|A bird's eye view of the Science Centre in the evening]]
The Science Centre was carved out of the [[National Museum of Singapore]] as a separate institution so that the latter could focus on its artistic and historical collections. This idea was first mooted in 1969 by the [[Science Council of Singapore]], and was subsequently approved by the [[Government of Singapore|Government]] which was keen to promote scientific education in the rapidly modernising country so as to tap into the technological sector.
 
The SCS building's architecture was decided by an [[architectural design competition]] organised by the Science Centre Board. [[Raymond Woo]]'s entry was selected, and he was thus commissioned as the architect for the project. Built at a cost of [[Singapore dollar|S$]]12 million on a {{convert|60,000|sqm|adj=on}} site in [[Jurong East]], it was officially opened on 10 December 1977 by Dr. [[Toh Chin Chye]], who was the Minister-in-charge of the Science Centre Board.

In 1987, the centre saw a significant expansion with the opening of Singapore's first and only [[OMNIMAX]] theatre, the [[Singapore Omni-Theatre]]. Costing $18 million, it has a 276-seat theatre underneath a {{convert|23|m|adj=on}} tilted dome.

In 1999, a $38 million renovation expanded the centre's exhibition space, and created a new entrance as well as open-air exhibition areas and a direct connection to the separate Omni-Theatre building. In 2000, [[Snow City]], a recreation of a {{convert|-5|C|adj=on}} environment in tropical Singapore, was set up beside the Omni-Theatre.

On 7 December 2007 in the year of its 30th anniversary, the Science Centre rebranded itself as the Science Centre Singapore (SCS).

==Observatory==
[[File:The Observatory, Singapore Science Centre.JPG|thumb|The Observatory at the Science Centre is one of the few observatories in the world located next to the Equator]]

===Location===
The Science Centre Observatory is situated at {{Coord|1.3342|103.7357|display = inline}}, and is {{convert|15.27|m}} above mean sea level. It is one of the few observatories in the world located next to the [[equator]]. Its unique position allows constellations in both the northern and southern celestial hemispheres to be observed and thus opens up more vistas in the sky for observers. The Observatory is endowed with a range of sophisticated facilities as well as a classroom for astronomy lessons, slide shows and public talks.

===Telescope===
The main telescope of the Observatory is a {{convert|40|cm|adj=on}} [[Cassegrain reflector]] of a combined [[focal length]] of {{convert|520|cm}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} The sub-telescope is a {{convert|15|cm|adj=on}} [[apochromatic]] [[Kepler refractor]] with a focal length of {{convert|180|cm}}. The [[equatorial mount]] for the telescopes was designed for Singapore's unique location; the accompanying [[equatorial mount#English or Yoke mount|English yoke]] provides the stability needed for the drive and tracking mechanisms. The {{convert|5.5|m|adj=on}} stainless steel dome can be made to swivel in any direction and its shutter can be made to slide open for the telescope to be focused on to interesting objects in the sky.

===Stargazing sessions===
The Observatory has been open to the public for stargazing sessions every Friday night since June 2006. The opening hours are from 7:50 to 10:00 pm. The Observatory can comfortably accommodate 50 visitors per session. It is important to note that stargazing through the observatory telescope is only possible when the sky is clear. However, regardless of weather conditions, the staff will be present.

==Relocation plans==
On 4 April 2008, the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] announced plans to relocate the Science Centre next to [[Chinese Garden MRT Station]] in ten to 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Blueprint for Jurong unveiled: URA plans to transform Jurong Lake District into a unique lakeside destination for business and leisure|url=http://www.ura.gov.sg/uol/media-room/news/2008/apr/Copy%20of%20pr08-38.aspx|publisher=[[Urban Redevelopment Authority]]|date=4 April 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During his speech at the National Day Rally 2014, the prime minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong said that by 2020, the Science Centre will be relocated to the north shore of Jurong Lake, beside [[Chinese Garden MRT Station]].

'''''Sophie's World''''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Sofies verden'') is a 1991 novel by Norwegian writer [[Jostein Gaarder]]. It follows the events of Sophie Amundsen, a teenage girl living in [[Norway]], and Alberto Knox, a middle-aged philosopher who introduces her to [[philosophy|philosophical]] thinking and the [[history of philosophy]].

''Sophie's World'' was originally written in Norwegian and became a best seller in Norway. It won the [[Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis]] in 1994. The [[English language|English]] version of the novel was published in 1995, and the book was reported to be the best-selling book in the world in that year.
By 2011 the novel had been translated into fifty-nine languages, with over forty million [[Printing|print copies]] sold.&lt;ref&gt;''The National'': Sophie's World author turns from philosophy to climate change on Sophie's World: "The novel has now been translated into 59 languages, and has sold an estimated 40 million copies." (14 March 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most commercially successful Norwegian novels outside of Norway, and has been adapted into a [[Sophie's World (film)|film]] and a PC game.

==Plot summary==
Sophie Amundsen (Sofie Amundsen in the Norwegian version) is a 14-year-old [[girl]] who lives in [[Norway]] in the year 1990.

The book begins with Sophie receiving two messages in her mailbox and a [[postcard]] addressed to Hilde Møller Knag. Afterwards, she receives a packet of papers, part of a course in [[philosophy]].

Sophie, without the knowledge of her mother, becomes the student of an old philosopher, Alberto Knox. Alberto teaches her about the [[history of philosophy]]. She gets a substantive and understandable review from the [[Pre-Socratics]] to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. In addition to this, Sophie and Alberto receive postcards addressed to a girl named Hilde from a man named Albert Knag. As time passes Knag begins to hide birthday messages to Hilde in ever more impossible ways, including hiding one inside an unpeeled banana and making Alberto's dog, Hermes, speak.

Eventually, through the philosophy of [[George Berkeley]], Sophie and Alberto figure out that their entire world is a literary construction by Albert Knag as a present for Hilde, his daughter, on her 15th birthday. Hilde begins to read the manuscript but begins to turn against her father after he continues to meddle with Sophie's life by sending fictional characters like [[Little Red Riding Hood]] and [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] to talk to her.

Alberto helps Sophie fight back against Knag's control by teaching her everything he knows about philosophy, through the [[Renaissance]], [[Romanticism]], and [[Existentialism]], as well as [[Darwinism]] and the ideas of [[Karl Marx]]. These take the form of long pages of text, and, later, monologues from Alberto. Alberto manages to concoct a plan so that he and Sophie can finally escape Albert's [[imagination]]. The trick is performed on [[Midsummer]]'s Eve, during a "philosophical garden party" that Sophie and her mother arranged to celebrate Sophie's fifteenth birthday. The party soon begins to follow into chaos as Albert Knag lords his control over the world, causing the guests to react with indifference to extraordinary occurrences. Alberto informs everyone that their world is fictional but the guests react with rage, believing him to be instilling dangerous values in the children. When a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] smashes into the garden, Alberto and Sophie use it as an opportunity to escape. Knag is so focused on writing about the car that he doesn't notice them escaping into the real world.

Having finished the book, Hilde decides to help Sophie and Alberto get revenge on her father. Alberto and Sophie cannot interact with anything in the real world and cannot be seen by anyone but other fictional characters. A woman from [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]] gives them food before they prepare to witness Knag's return to [[Lillesand]], Hilde's home.

While at the airport, Knag receives notes from Hilde set up at shops and gateways, instructing him on items to buy. He becomes increasingly paranoid as he wonders how Hilde is pulling the trick off. When he arrives back home, Hilde has forgiven him now that he has learned what it is like to have his world interfered with. Alberto and Sophie listen as Knag tells Hilde about one last aspect of philosophy—the [[universe]] itself. He tells her about the [[Big Bang]] and how everything is made up of the same material, which exploded outward at the beginning of time. Hilde learns that when she looks at the stars she is actually seeing into the past. Sophie makes a last effort to communicate with her by hitting her and Knag with a wrench. Knag doesn't feel anything, but Hilde feels as though a [[Horse-fly|gadfly]] stung her, and can hear Sophie's whispers. Sophie wishes to ride in the [[rowboat]] but Alberto reminds her that as they are not real people, they cannot manipulate objects. In spite of this, Sophie manages to untie the rowboat and they ride out onto the lake, immortal and invisible to all but a few. Hilde, inspired and mesmerized by philosophy and reconnected with her father, goes out to get the boat back.

In 1999 ''Sophie's World'' was adapted into a Norwegian movie by screenwriter [[Petter Skavlan]]. It was not widely released outside of Norway. [[Kjersti Holmen]] won an [[Amanda (award)|Amanda Award]] for her role in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmweb.no/filmfestivalen2007/multimedia/archive/00115/Amandavinnere_1985__115375a.pdf|title=AMANDA-VINNERE 1985-2006|publisher=Filmweb.no|author=|date=|accessdate=2008-03-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920231356/http://www.filmweb.no/filmfestivalen2007/multimedia/archive/00115/Amandavinnere_1985__115375a.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
The 1999 movie was also presented as an eight-part TV series in [[Australia]] and [[Iceland]], again scripted by Petter Skavlan.

It was also adapted for television in 1995 by [[Paul Greengrass]] and shown on the BBC as part of ''[[The Late Show (BBC TV series)|The Late Show]]''. This version starred Jessica Marshall-Gardiner as Sophie, [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as Albert Knox, and [[Twiggy]] as Sophie's Mother.

===Board game===
In 1999 it was made into a board game by Robert Hyde and Ken Howard, and published by Sophisticated Games Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sophisticated-games.com&lt;/ref&gt; The game involves answering trivia on famous philosophers and requires players to talk for several minutes on philosophical topics such as animal rights.

===Computer game===
In 1998 it was adapted into a [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Mac OS|Mac]] [[CD-ROM]] [[video game|game]] by [[The MultiMedia Corporation]].{{cn|date=March 2017}} The game allows players to learn about philosophy as in the book, while adapting the [[metafiction]] elements for a virtual world.

===Music===
English space rock band [[Spiritualized]] named their 1997 studio album ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space]]'' after a line in the novel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15084">'''Specific absorption rate''' ('''SAR''') is a measure of the rate at which [[energy]] is [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] by the human body when exposed to a [[radio frequency]] (RF) [[electromagnetic field]]. It can also refer to absorption of other forms of energy by tissue, including [[ultrasound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sun |first1= J|last2= Hynynen |first2= K |title=Focusing of therapeutic ultrasound through a human skull: a numerical study |journal=[[J Acoust Soc Am]] |origyear= September 1998 |pmid=9745750 |date=2013-08-12 | bibcode=1998ASAJ..104.1705S| volume=104| pages=1705–15| doi=10.1121/1.424383|issue=3 Pt 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as the [[Power (physics)|power]] absorbed per [[mass]] of [[body tissue|tissue]] and has units of [[watt]]s per [[kilogram]] (W/kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Jianming |last= Jin | title= Electromagnetic Analysis and Design in Magnetic Resonance Imaging | year= 1998 | publisher= CRC Press | isbn= 978-0-8493-9693-9 | pages = §5.3.3 pp. 226ff }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Kshetrimayum|first= Rakhesh Singh|author-link= Rakhesh Singh Kshetrimayum|title= Mobile Phones: Bad for your Health?|journal= IEEE Potentials|volume= 27|issue= 2|url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4475802/?arnumber=4475802 |doi= 10.1109/MPOT.2008.919701|date= March-April 2008|pages= 18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SAR is usually averaged either over the whole body, or over a small sample volume (typically 1&amp;nbsp;g or 10&amp;nbsp;g of tissue). The value cited is then the maximum level measured in the body part studied over the stated volume or mass.

== Calculation ==

SAR for electromagnetic energy can be calculated from the [[electric field]] within the tissue as:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{SAR} = \frac{1}{V}\int_\textrm{sample} \frac{\sigma(\mathbf{r}) |\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})|^2}{\rho(\mathbf{r})} d\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the sample [[electrical conductivity]]
:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Root mean square|RMS]] electric field
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the sample [[density]]
:&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the sample
SAR measures exposure to fields between 100&amp;nbsp;kHz and 10&amp;nbsp;GHz (known as radio waves).&lt;ref name=icnirp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icnirp.org/documents/emfgdl.pdf|title=ICNIRP Guidelines For Limiting Exposure To The Time-Varying Electric, Magnetic And Electromagnetic Fields (Up To 300 GHz)|publisher=[[International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection]]|year=1998|accessdate=2013-12-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606044606/http://www.icnirp.org/documents/emfgdl.pdf|archivedate=2014-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used to measure power absorbed from [[mobile phones]] and during [[MRI]] scans. The value will depend heavily on the geometry of the part of the body that is exposed to the RF energy, and on the exact location and geometry of the RF source. Thus tests must be made with each specific source, such as a mobile phone model, and at the intended position of use.

=== Mobile phone SAR testing ===
{{see also|Mobile phone radiation and health}}
When measuring the SAR due to a mobile phone the phone is placed against a representation of a human head (a "SAR Phantom") in a talk position. The SAR value is then measured at the location that has the highest absorption rate in the entire head, which in the case of a mobile phone is often as close to the phone's antenna as possible. Measurements are made for different positions on both sides of the head and at different frequencies representing the frequency bands at which the device can transmit. Depending on the size and capabilities of the phone, additional testing may also be required to represent usage of the device while placed close to the user's body and/or extremities. Various governments have defined maximum SAR levels for RF energy emitted by mobile devices:

*[[United States]]: the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] requires that phones sold have a SAR level at or below 1.6&amp;nbsp;[[watt]]s per [[kilogram]] (W/kg) taken over the volume containing a mass of 1&amp;nbsp;gram of tissue that is absorbing the most signal.
*[[European Union]]: [[CENELEC]] specify SAR limits within the EU, following [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standards. For mobile phones, and other such hand-held devices, the SAR limit is 2&amp;nbsp;W/kg averaged over the 10&amp;nbsp;g of tissue absorbing the most signal ([http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/033746 IEC 62209-1]).
*[[India]]: switched from the EU limits to the US limits for mobile handsets in 2012. Unlike the US, India will not rely solely on SAR measurements provided by manufacturers; random compliance tests are done by a government-run [[Telecommunication Engineering Center]] (TEC) SAR Laboratory on handsets and 10% of towers. All handsets must have a hands free mode.&lt;ref name=IAreg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=87152 |title=Stringent Mobile Radiation Standards Come into Force from tomorrow New Mobile Handsets to comply with SAR Value of 1.6W/KG - Penalty, Random Checks Introduced for Enforcement |publisher=[[Press Information Bureau]], Government of India |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SAR values are heavily dependent on the size of the averaging volume. Without information about the averaging volume used, comparisons between different measurements cannot be made. Thus, the European 10-gram ratings should be compared among themselves, and the American 1-gram ratings should only be compared among themselves.
To check SAR on your mobile phone, review the documentation provided with the phone, dial *#07# (only works on some models) or visit the manufacturer's website.

=== MRI scanner SAR testing ===
For Magnetic Resonance Imaging the limits (described in [http://webstore.iec.ch/Webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/043851?opendocument IEC 60601-2-33]) are slightly more complicated:

(a) Local SAR is determined over the mass of 10&amp;nbsp;g.

(b) The limit scales dynamically with the ratio "exposed patient mass / patient mass":

NORMAL OPERATING MODE: Partial body SAR = 10&amp;nbsp;W/kg – (8&amp;nbsp;W/kg * exposed patient mass / patient mass)&lt;br&gt;
FIRST LEVEL CONTROLLED OPERATING MODE: Partial body SAR = 10&amp;nbsp;W/kg – (6&amp;nbsp;W/kg * exposed patient mass / patient mass)

(c) In cases where the orbit is in the field of a small local RF transmit coil, care should be taken to ensure that the temperature rise is limited to 1&amp;nbsp;°C.

== Criticism ==

SAR limits set by law do not consider that the human body is particularly sensitive to the power peaks or frequencies responsible for the [[Microwave auditory effect|microwave hearing effect]].&lt;ref name="frey2"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/17/4/689.abstract?sid=7c073ad2-6324-4b47-94e1-124dc0a5f154 | journal=Journal of Applied Physiology| volume=17 |pages=689–692 |year=1962| title=Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy |last=Frey|first= Allan H|accessdate=| pmid=13895081 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frey-headaches"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frey|first= Allan H  |title=Headaches from cellular telephones: are they real and what are the implications? |year=1998 |volume=106 |publisher=[[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] |journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] |pmc=1533043 |issue=3|doi=10.1289/ehp.98106101|pages=101–103 |pmid=9441959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frey reports that the microwave hearing effect occurs with average power density exposures of 400 μw/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, well below SAR limits (as set by government regulations).&lt;ref name="frey2" /&gt;

Notes:

In comparison to the short term, relatively intensive exposures described above, for long term environmental exposure of the general public there is a limit of 0.08&amp;nbsp;W/kg averaged over the whole body.&lt;ref name=icnirp/&gt; A whole-body average SAR of 0.4&amp;nbsp;W/kg has been chosen as the restriction that provides adequate protection for occupational exposure. An additional safety factor of 5 is introduced for exposure of the public, giving an average whole-body SAR limit of 0.08&amp;nbsp;W/kg.

=== FCC advice ===
The FCC Guide, "Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) For Cell Phones: What It Means For You," after detailing the limitations of SAR values, offers the following "bottom line" editorial:

{{quote|"ALL cell phones must meet the FCC’s RF exposure standard, which is set at a level well below that at which laboratory testing indicates, and medical and biological experts generally agree, adverse health effects could occur. For users who are concerned with the adequacy of this standard or who otherwise wish to further reduce their exposure, the most effective means to reduce exposure are to hold the cell phone away from the head or body and to use a speakerphone or hands-free accessory. These measures will generally have much more impact on RF energy absorption than the small difference in SAR between individual cell phones, which, in any event, is an unreliable comparison of RF exposure to consumers, given the variables of individual use." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/specific-absorption-rate-sar-cell-phones-what-it-means-you |title=Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) For Cell Phones: What It Means For You |publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]] |date= |accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== MSBE (minimum SAR with biological effect) ===
In order to find out possible advantages and the interaction mechanisms of Electromagnetic fields (EMF), the minimum SAR (or intensity) that could have biological effect (MSBE) would be much more valuable in comparison to studying high intensity fields. Such studies can possibly shed light on thresholds of non-ionizing radiation effects and cell capabilities (e.g., oxidative response). In addition, it is more likely to reduce the complexity of the EMF interaction targets in cell cultures by lowering the exposure power, which at least reduces the overall rise in temperature. This parameter might differ regarding the case under study and depends on the physical and biological conditions of the exposed target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Sefidbakht|first1= Yahya|last2= Moosavi-Movahedi |first2= Ali Akbar|last3= Hosseinkhani|first3= Saman |last4= Khodagholi|first4= Fariba|last5= Torkzadeh-Mahani|first5= Masoud|last6= Foolad |first6= Forough|last7= Faraji-Dana|first7= Reza|title=Effects of 940 MHz EMF on Bioluminescence and Oxidative Response of Stable Luciferase Producing HEK Cells|journal=Photochemical and Photobiological Sciences |date=April 2014|volume=13|issue=7|page=1082|doi=10.1039/C3PP50451D|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/PP/2014/c3pp50451d#!divAbstract|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Super-LOTIS''' is the second incarnation of the [[Livermore Optical Transient Imaging System]], located at the [[Steward Observatory]] on [[Kitt Peak]]. It
is an automated [[telescope]] designed to slew very rapidly to the location of [[gamma-ray burst]]s (GRBs), to enable the simultaneous measurement of optical counterparts. GRBs can occur anywhere in the sky, fade very quickly, and were initially poorly localized, so the original LOTIS needed very rapid slewing (less than 10 sec) and an extremely wide [[field of view]] (greater than 15 degrees). However, this wide field of view meant it could not see faint sources, and only the brightest GRB afterglows could be studied.

Later satellites such as [[HETE-2]], and  [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory#BATSE|BATSE]] detector of the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]], delivered much more accurate GRB coordinates in real-time. This enabled the construction of Super-LOTIS, based upon a [[Boller and Chivens]] 0.6 meter telescope, with a much smaller field of view (originally 51' by 51'), but much deeper imaging. After a few years of operation in this mode (2000 to 2003), the [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission]] was launched in 2004 providing even smaller error boxes. The super-LOTIS optics were modified again, now with a 17' by 17' field of view at the secondary focus, and a simultaneous visible/NIR camera.

To achieve the needed response time, Super-LOTIS is fully automated and connected via Internet socket to the [[Gamma-ray Burst Coordinates Network]]. It is still in operation as of 2012.

Since GRB searches only occupy a small fraction of the possible observing time, Super-LOTIS is also used for [[supernova]] searches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aas.org/archives/BAAS/v32n2/aas196/436.htm |title=Novae and Supernovae Searches with the Super-LOTIS Telescope |publisher=AAS }}&lt;/ref&gt; and general astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ucolick.org/superlotis.html |title=Observing with Super-LOTIS |publisher=University of California, Santa Cruz.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5085">'''Transactional sex''' refers to [[sexual relationship]]s where the giving of gifts or services is an important factor. Transactional sex is a [[superset]] of [[prostitution]], in that the exchange of gifts for sex includes a broader set of (usually non-marital) obligations that do not necessarily involve a predetermined payment or gift, but where there is a definite motivation to benefit materially from the sexual exchange.{{sfn|Hunter|2002}} The participants do not necessarily frame themselves in terms of prostitutes/clients, but often as girlfriends/boyfriends, or [[sugar baby|sugar babies]]/sugar daddies.{{sfn|Hoefinger|2010}}{{sfn|Hoefinger|2013}} Those offering sex may or may not feel affection for their partners.

== In Sub-Saharan Africa ==

The pervasiveness of transactional sex in sub-saharan Africa, common in non-marital relationships across all income categories, is closely linked to socio-cultural expectations of gender whereby a man is expected to act as a provider to their partners and women expect a compensation for 'giving' sex.  This results in implicit assumptions of exchange, whereby for example a man might buy a woman a drink and her acceptance implies a willingness to have sex. Transactional sex is also becoming a vehicle for migration in places where younger women have intimate relationships with older men from for example Europe or North America.{{sfn|Groes-Green|2014}}

The general consensus among those studying transactional sex is that it is associated with the joint onslaught of [[poverty]] and the influence of Western [[consumerism]], the differences in economic power between men and women, and the breakdown of traditional African marriage customs involving [[bridewealth]]. Some scholars also associate transactional sex with the use of female erotic power and new inter-generational strategies and argue that these are part of a broader moral economy where the money young women earn from transactional sex is redistributed to kin and peers.{{sfn|Groes-Green|2013}}{{sfn|Groes-Green|2014}}{{sfn|Cole|2010}}

Though these relationships are common in Sub-Sahara Africa, they are also increasingly common in other parts of the world, such as Southeast Asia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1935">'''Safe Working Load (SWL)''' sometimes stated as the '''Normal Working Load (NWL)''' is the maximum safe [[force]] that a piece of [[lifting equipment]], lifting device or accessory can exert to lift, suspend, or lower, a given [[mass]] without fear of breaking.  Usually marked on the equipment by the manufacturer. It is a calculation of the '''Minimum Breaking Strength (MBS)''' aka '''Minimum Breaking Load (MBL)''' divided by its risk factor, usually ten to one (10:1 or 1/10) for lifting equipment although depending on the application, other fractions may be used such as 1/4, 1/5 and 1/6.&lt;ref name="Working Load Limit Defined and Replaces Safe Working Load Terminology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Working Load Limit|title=Working Load Limit Defined and Replaces Safe Working Load Terminology|url=http://www.beyondrigging.com/2014/03/working-load-limit/}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="safe working load"&gt;nj{{cite web|last=SWL|title=safe working load|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/safe-working-load-SWL.html|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Working Load &amp; Safety Factors"&gt;{{cite web|last=Working Load|title=Working Load &amp; Safety Factors|url=http://amtecgrips.com/working-load-safety-factors|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other synonyms include '''Working Load Limit (WLL)''', which is the maximum working load designed by the manufacturer. This load represents a [[force]] that is much less than that required to make the lifting equipment fail or yield, also known as the '''SWL''' the '''WLL''' is calculated by dividing '''MBL''' by a [[safety factor]] ('''SF'''). An example of this would be a [[chain]] that has a '''MBL''' of 2000 [[lbf]] (8.89 [[Kilonewton|kN]]) would have a '''SWL''' or '''WLL''' of 400 lbf (1.78 kN) if a safety factor of 5 (5:1, 5 to 1, or 1/5) is used.

As such:

'''WLL''' = '''MBL / SF'''
