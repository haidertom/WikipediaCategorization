The '''Accounting Professional &amp; Ethical Standards Board''' (APESB) is an independent, national body that sets out the code of ethics and professional standards with which accounting professionals who are members of CPA Australia, Institute of Chartered Accountants or Institute of Public Accountants must comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.charteredaccountants.com.au/Industry-Topics/Ethical-and-professional-standards/Standards-setting-bodies-and-upcoming-meetings.aspx
 |publisher=ICAA
 |title=Standard setting bodies and upcoming meetings
 |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization and mandate==

The APESB was established by [[CPA Australia]] and the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia]] in February 2006, and later that year the [[National Institute of Accountants]] (now called the [[Institute of Public Accountants]]) became the third member of the APESB.  The three organizations jointly fund the APESB. Members of these three major Australian accounting bodies have a responsibility to act in the public interest. They are expected to act with objectivity and integrity in their dealings with investors, governments, clients, employers and employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate=2014-08-12 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==

The Accounting Professional &amp; Ethical Standards Board (APESB) corporate structure is one of a company limited by guarantee. The role, structure and responsibilities of the Board of Directors is outlined in the Board Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.apesb.org.au/apesb-content/85/Governance

 |archivedate=2014-08-04 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to international standards==

Where relevant, APESB has adopted appropriate professional and ethical standards issued by a standard setting board of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). Whilst the applicable APESB standards remain consistent with IFAC standards, additional requirements or guidance may be included, taking into consideration the Australian environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.apesb.org.au/apesb-content/5129/apesb-five-year-anniversary-booklet 
 |publisher=APESB 
 |title=Accounting Professional &amp; Ethical Standards Board 
 |accessdate=2014-08-12 
 |deadurl=yes 
 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812210912/http://www.apesb.org.au/apesb-content/5129/apesb-five-year-anniversary-booklet 
 |archivedate=2014-08-12 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2006 version of the ''Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants'' was based on the code issued by the [[International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants]] (IESBA) of the IFAC, but some provisions were amended to align with Australian legislation. When a revised version of the ''Code of Ethics'' was issued in December 2010, reflecting changes to the IESBA code issued in July 2009, the specific Australian requirements were omitted, replaced with a warning that accountants were also required to comply with legislation such as the Corporations Act 2001.
The APESB contributes to development of international standards through submissions to the IESBA and as a member of the IESBA National Standards Setters group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher=ICAA
 |title=Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand
 |accessdate=2014-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

APESB develops new and revised standards, taking into consideration market and stakeholder needs. APESB follows a rigorous process in developing professional and ethical standards, based on a well-documented process, which is available at: http://www.apesb.org.au/uploads/apesb-work-programs/revised-due-process-dec-2013-final.pdf. Additionally, APESB takes a proactive approach to review each professional pronouncement six months after its initial commencement date and annually thereafter, to ensure each standard remains up to date and relevant. Stakeholders provide input to these review processes by reporting them to APESB via the online issues register on APESB’s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4678">'''Aleksandar "Aco" Đukanović''' ({{lang-cnr|Ацо Ђукановић}}) is a controversial [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] businessman, widely considered to be one of the richest and most powerful individuals in the country, along with [[Brano Mićunović]]. [[Vesko Barović]], [[Dragan Brković]] and others from the Montenegrin [[nouveau riche]] class that emerged during the 1990s following the break-up of [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. All of Aco Đukanović's wealth and influence were achieved during his older brother [[Milo Đukanović]]'s rule in Montenegro as Prime Minister and President of the Republic (1991–2006) and currently as the ruling political party's ([[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|DPS]]) president and prime minister again (2006–present).

==Life==
===Early activities===
Aco Đukanović's early business activity during the 1990s was folk concert booking, promotion and organizing through his first company Maraton.

===2000s===
Aco Đukanović was in the news when along with Vladislav "Pajo" Jabučanin he physically attacked and beat up [[Liberal Alliance of Montenegro|LSCG]] activist Zoran "Feki" Kljajić.[http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2000&amp;mm=06&amp;dd=05&amp;nav_category=1&amp;nav_id=7404] The attack occurred on Sunday, June 4, 2000 at around 11:30pm in the lobby of Hotel Crna Gora in [[Podgorica]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20020909123203/http://www.medijaklub.cg.yu/zanimljivi/zanimljivi06-00/06-1.htm] Kljajić ended up with severe injuries - skull fracture on the forehead for which he underwent emergency surgery.[http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/06/07/srpski/H00060601.shtm] Jabučanin and Đukanović were detained by police.[http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/06/07/srpski/H00060602.shtm] The case against Đukanović dragged in the courts for years before being acquitted in December 2004 while Jabučanin got sentenced to 4 months in prison.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722174111/http://www.pobjeda.co.me/citanje.php?datum=2004-12-10&amp;id=49533] On appeal, the re-trial was ordered, but in 2007 on the very first session of the re-trial the court concluded that the suit against Đukanović is too old.[https://web.archive.org/web/20090810125212/http://www.monitorcg.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=742%3Abracova-vremena&amp;catid=346%3Abroj-970&amp;Itemid=584]

His current company Monte Nova is prominent as a Montenegrin business - according to an annual report by [[Central Bank of Montenegro|Montenegrin Central Bank]], Monte Nova is the fourth most profitable company in Montenegro (most profitable among the companies with domestic ownership) with a profit of [[euro|€]]8.1 million in year 2006.&lt;small&gt;[http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/story.php?vest=77288]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/small&gt; In November 2006, Monte Nova acquired [[Nikšićka banka]]. Monte Nova reportedly also holds substantial influence in Elektroprivreda CG (Montenegrin hydro company) as it is trying to take over [[Pljevlja]] [[coal mine]] (accounting for 100% of Montenegro's coal production) and [[thermal power station]] (accounting for 45% of power supply within the republic).&lt;small&gt;[http://www.revija92.novosti.rs/code/navigate.php?Id=215]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/small&gt;

Đukanović also held stake in [[Crnogorska komercijalna banka]], which he sold to Hungarian [[OTP Bank]], reportedly for [[euro|€]]10 million.

In January 2007, he bought 75% stake in Montenegrin urbanism authority for [[euro|€]]2.7 million.&lt;small&gt;[http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/region.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=21&amp;nav_id=228622&amp;fs=1]&lt;/small&gt;

Around the same time he bought the documentation for the third [[mobile telephony|mobile operator]] licence in Montenegro but ended up not placing an official bid, and the licence went to [[Telekom Srbija]].&lt;small&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110725141251/http://www.danas.rs/20070216/ekonomija1.html#1]&lt;/small&gt;

'''Adelaide city centre''' is the [[inner city|innermost]] locality of [[Adelaide|Greater Adelaide]], the capital city of [[South Australia]]. It is known by locals simply as ''"The City"'' or ''"Town"'' to distinguish it from [[Adelaide|Greater Adelaide]] and from the [[City of Adelaide]] (which also includes [[North Adelaide]] and the [[Adelaide Park Lands|Park Lands]]). The locality is split into two key geographical distinctions: the city "square mile", bordered by [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North]], [[East Terrace, Adelaide|East]], [[South Terrace, Adelaide|South]] and [[West Terrace, Adelaide|West Terrace]]s; and the section of the parklands south of the [[River Torrens]] which separates the built up part of the city from the surrounding suburbs and North Adelaide.

The locality is home to the [[Parliament of South Australia]] and many key state government offices. Due to the construction of many new apartments in the city, the population has grown over ten years from 10,229 (2006 census)&lt;ref name="Census2006"&gt;{{Census 2006 AUS | id = SSC41011 | name = Adelaide (State Suburb) | accessdate = 23 November 2017 | quick = on}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 15,115 (2016 census).&lt;ref name=Census2016/&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of Adelaide}}
{{See also|City of Adelaide#History}}
[[File:Currie Street, Adelaide, 1925.jpg|thumb|left|[[Currie Street, Adelaide|Currie Street]] looking east, circa 1925]]
[[File:Adelaide in 1935.jpg|thumb|Adelaide in 1935]]

Before the [[European settlement of South Australia]], the [[Adelaide Plains]], on which Adelaide was built, were home to the [[Kaurna people|Kaurna]] group of [[Indigenous Australians]]. The colony of South Australia was established in 1836 at [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]], and the city itself established in 1837. The location and layout of the city is accredited to [[William Light|Colonel William Light]] (1786–1839), in a plan known as [[Light's Vision]]. The area where the Adelaide city centre now exists was once known as "[[Tarndanya]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaurnaplacenames.com/primary.php?id=4625 "Tarndanya"], KauranaPlaceNames.com. Retrieved 2009-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; which translates as "male red kangaroo rock" in [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]], an area along the south bank of what is now known as the [[River Torrens]], which flows through Adelaide.

Kaurna numbers were significantly reduced by at least two widespread [[epidemic]]s of [[smallpox]] which preceded European settlement, having been transported downstream along the [[Murray River]]. When European settlers arrived in 1836, estimates of the Kaurna population ranged from 300 to 1000 people.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
British Captain [[Matthew Flinders]], along with French Captain [[Nicolas Baudin]], charted the southeast coast of Australia, where Adelaide is located. Flinders named Mount Lofty in 1802 but provided little information on Adelaide itself.

Charles Sturt later explored the Murray and wrote a favourable reflection on what he saw. Colonel [[William Light]] is credited largely with settling and laying out the Adelaide region, which included a [[grid plan]] of Adelaide's streets. Adelaide was not as badly affected by the 1860s economic depression in Australia as other gold rush cities like [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]], allowing it to prosper. Historian F.W. Crowley noted that the city was full of elite upper-class citizens which provided a stark contrast to the grinding poverty of the labour areas and [[slums]] outside the inner city ring. Due to its historic puritan wealth during the 20th century, the city retains a notable portion of Victorian architecture.

==Geography==
=== Built environment ===
[[File:Streetmap of Adelaide and North Adelaide.svg|thumb|Adelaide city centre, North Adelaide and the Park Lands]]
Adelaide is separated from its greater metropolitan area by a ring of public [[Adelaide Parklands|parklands]] on all sides. The so-called "square mile" within the park lands is defined by a small area of high rise office and apartment buildings in the centre north, around [[King William Street, Adelaide|King William Street]], which runs north-to-south through the centre. Surrounding this central business district are a large number of medium to low density [[apartment]]s, [[townhouse]]s and [[detached houses]] which make up the residential portion of the city centre.

=== Layout ===
The layout of Adelaide, known as Light's Vision, features a [[cardinal direction]] [[grid pattern]] of wide streets and terraces and five large public squares: [[Victoria Square, Adelaide|Victoria Square]] in the centre of the city, and [[Hindmarsh Square, Adelaide|Hindmarsh]], [[Light Square, Adelaide|Light]], [[Hurtle Square, Adelaide|Hurtle]] and [[Whitmore Square, Adelaide|Whitmore Square]]s in the centres of each of the four quadrants of the Adelaide city centre.  These squares occupy 32 of the 700 numbered "town acre" allotments on Light's plan.

All east-west roads change their names as they cross King William Street, except for [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North]] and [[South Terrace, Adelaide|South]] terraces.&lt;ref name=map&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Royal Automobile Association]]|title=Adelaide CBD &amp; North Adelaide|url=http://www.soulunderground.com.au/national_files/CBDMAP.pdf|accessdate=7 December 2014}} This map, showing the [[Adelaide]] city centre, [[North Adelaide]] and the [[Adelaide Parklands]], was published on the website {{cite web|title=soul underground|url=http://www.soulunderground.com.au/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also alternate between being wide and narrow, {{convert|99|and|66|ft}}, except for the central Grote and Wakefield which are extra-wide, {{convert|132|ft}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrNWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v4Cv3n95zg&amp;sig=b15yqtrUZTxnn5kSqvd9W354B0I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TyaFVKT3MYu4oQSM2oKwAg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAw |page=3 |title=Handbook to the Colony of South Australia |author=Elgar, Frederic |date=1863 |accessdate=8 December 2014 |location=London |publisher="Australian and New Zealand Gazette" Office | quote=... principal north and south streets (from 99 to 132 feet wide) being nearly one mile in length, and the east and west streets (from 66 to 132 feet wide) from a mile and a quarter to a mile and three quarters.}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the surrounding four terraces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Light's Plan of Adelaide 1837 |date=31 December 2013 |author= Margaret Anderson |url=http://adelaidia.sa.gov.au/panoramas/lights-plan-of-adelaide-1837 |publisher=History SA |accessdate=5 May 2018 |website= adelaidia.sa.gov.au }}&lt;br&gt;The page contains a copy of one of the two surviving original plans drawn in 1837. Quote: "It is a watercolour and ink plan, drawn by 16-year-old draughtsman Robert George Thomas to instructions from Light. ... The streets were named by a Street Naming Committee that met on 23 May 1837, indicating that this plan must have been completed after that date."&lt;/ref&gt; In the south half of the city, in several places the Adelaide City Council has constructed wide footpaths and road markings to restrict traffic to a lesser number of lanes than the full width of the road could support.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

=== Street names ===
[[File:Adelaide Post Office architectural detail.jpg|thumb|right|Architectural detail of the [[Adelaide General Post Office]] on King William Street]]
The streets and squares were named by a committee of a number of prominent settlers after themselves, after early directors of the South Australian Company, after Commissioners appointed by the British government to oversee implementation of the acts that established the colony, and after various notables involved in the establishment of the colony.

The [[Street Naming Committee (Adelaide)|Street Naming Committee]] comprised:&lt;ref name="StreetList"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.historysouthaustralia.net/STlist.htm |title=The Street Naming Committee |work=HistorySouthAustralia.net |date=30 September 2001 |accessdate=22 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the [[Adelaide Festival]] and [[Adelaide Fringe Festival]] are held within Adelaide's city centre during February and March.

North Terrace is considered Adelaide's "cultural boulevard" because of its tight concentration of galleries and museums.

[[File:Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems.gif|thumb|right|Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems]]
The '''Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems (AIOS)''' is a reference architecture for the development of interoperable [[enterprise information systems]]. If enterprises or public administrations want to engage in automated business processes with other organizations, their IT systems must be able to work together, i.e. they need to be [[interoperability|interoperable]]. The AIOS represents a generic building plan for these organizations to develop interoperable information systems by systematically adjusting and extending their internal information systems.
The AIOS was described in a doctoral thesis and is based on the results of various research projects on interoperability.&lt;ref&gt;Ziemann (2010): [http://www.logos-verlag.de/cgi-bin/buch/isbn/2414 Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems - An enterprise Model-based Approach for Describing and Enacting Collaborative Business Processes.] Logos, 2010. A summary can be found here: Ziemann (2012): Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems - Reference Architecture for Collaborations between Public Administrations. In: Krallmann, H., Zapp, A. (Eds.): Bausteine einer vernetzten Verwaltung. Berlin, Erich Schmidt Verlag, 2012, pp. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; It is independent from specific products or vendors but describes generically the different layers, views, relationships and technical means needed to efficiently establish interoperable information systems. To this aim it combines concepts from [[service-oriented architecture]], Collaborative Business and [[Business Process Modelling]]. It can be seen as complementary to [[Architecture of Integrated Information Systems|ARIS]], a well-known architecture for internal information systems and business processes.

== Definition ==
Similar to the automation of processes inside organizations, the automation of cross-organizational [[business process]]es is an important trend. In this endeavor, collaborating organizations rather strive for a loose coupling of their information systems instead of a tight [[system integration|integration]]: the collaborating information systems should be able to work together but retain as much independency as possible. This characteristic is also called '''[[interoperability]]''', or in the context of collaborating organizations, [[Business Interoperability Interface#Business interoperability|Business Interoperability]], i.e. the capability of autonomous organizations to execute a collaborative business process among them.

'''[[Information system]]s''' are systems that process information, i.e. they capture, transport, transform, store and offer information. Following the conception prevailing in information systems research, an information system comprises not only the hardware and software of an enterprise, but also the related human actors, business functions and processes as well as organization structures.&lt;ref&gt;Compare for example Becker &amp; Schütte (2004, p. 33): Handelsinformationssysteme – Domänenorientierte Einführung in die Wirtschaftsinformatik 2nd Edition, Redline Wirtschaft, Frankfurt or Gabriel(2008): Informationssystem. Enzyklopädie der Wirtschaftsinformatik, Online Lexikon. Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; This broad understanding is for example also embodied by the [[Zachman Framework]].

'''[[Architecture]]''' is defined as the “fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution”.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE (2007): IEEE 1471 Website, IEEE Std. 1471 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) - Version 5.0, 19 July 2007. http://www.iso-architecture.org/ieee-1471/ieee-1471-faq.html, ac-cessed: May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Sinz defines an information system architecture as the building plan of an information system in the sense of a specification and documentation of its components and their relationships covering all relevant viewpoints as well as the constructions rules for the creation of the building plan.&lt;ref&gt;Sinz (2002): Architektur von Informationssystemen. In: Rechenberg, P., Pomberger, G. (eds.): Informatik-Handbuch. 3rd Edition, Hanser, München, pp. 1055-1068&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, an '''Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems''' can be defined as the building plan of a cross-organizational information system, which enables organizations to execute a collaborative business process among them.

== Background and Application ==
Following the work on interoperable information systems conducted in European Research Projects&lt;ref&gt;Interop NOE (2004 to 2007, project number IST-2004-508011), ATHENA (2004 to 2007, “Advanced Technologies for Interoperability of Heterogeneous Enterprise Networks and their Application”, project number IST-2004-507849) or R4eGov (2006 to 2009, project number IST-2004-026650)&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010 the Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems (AIOS) was published as a reference for the construction of loosely coupled, interoperating information systems and for the systematic, model-based enactment of collaborative business processes.

The AIOS aims primarily at large organizations that want to interoperate with each other. To this aim it describes how internal information system elements can be systematically connected with the information systems of collaboration partners. The main elements of the AIOS are:
# Description of the different data types comprised in interoperable information system as well as their relationships. This is also called the '''static''' part, or the ''structure'' of the architecture. It tells organizations which information elements (e.g. descriptions of messages, exchange sequences, roles and services) they have to provide to collaboration partners and how they can optimally correlate these to internal elements.
# Description of different building paths for implementing or adjusting interoperable information systems. This is also called the '''dynamic''' part of the architecture. It tells organization, how to iteratively develop the elements mentioned above.
# Concept for the technical '''components needed to implemenent''' the architecture, for example design tools, internal and externally visible repositories.
One element comprised in the third category is a '''"BII-repository"''', in which each organization publishes the content of its [[Business Interoperability Interface]] (BII) to collaboration partners. Since it comprises external views on information system elements, it provides publishing and discovery functionalities as needed in [[service-oriented architecture]]: In the BII, the externally relevant processes, services, organization structures etc. are described on various levels of technical granularity, enabling other organizations to search also for business-level elements and not only for technical artifacts. Here, different from the traditional SOA approach, instead of one central service directory, various partner-specific repositories are implemented.

== Structure ==
The static part of the architecture builds on three orthogonal axes: Enterprise Dimensions, Levels of technical Granularity and Colloborative Views.

=== Collaborative views ===
Similar to private, public and global views as known from business process and workflow modeling, in the AIOS, corresponding private, public and global views on information system elements are provided.
# The '''private view''' comprises the only internally visible information system elements.
# The '''public view''' acts as an interface to the internal, private system elements; it protects internal systems and enables interoperability without the need for a significant change to the internal systems. This public view describes the information system boundaries of an organization to its collaboration partners and connects internal and external information systems, thereby also providing the content of the [[Business Interoperability Interface]] of an organization.
# The '''global view''' can be used to correlate and connect the public views of different systems.

=== Enterprise dimensions ===
[[File:AIOS Enterprise Dimensions.JPG|thumb|Illustration of the Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems / Enterprise Dimensions]]
To describe business processes comprehensively this axis provides distinct views on processes, functions, data, and organizational elements. 
# In the '''organizational dimension''', roles, units and other organization elements relevant for the collaboration are described and related to internal elements. This ensures for example, that the collaboration partners have a common understanding of the interacting roles.
# In the '''data dimension''', document types used in the collaboration are defined and related to internally used document types. 
# In the '''function dimension''', business functions and services offered in the collaboration are described. 
# In the '''process dimension''', the processes that each organization offers are described as well as how these public processes are related to adjacent processes of partner organizations.
Thus, in combination with the axis "collaborative views",  '''private, public and global views on processes, functions, data, and organizational roles''' are provided.

=== Levels of technical granularity ===
[[File:AIOS Levels of technical detail.JPG|thumb|AIOS Levels of technical detail]]
The description of system elements on different levels of technical granularity supports a systematic development of collaborative information systems, starting with the business requirements definition and going all the way down to the code level. Apart from the construction aspect, thereby also a multi-dimensional interoperability description is provided, facilitating the synchronization of collaborating systems on each level. Similar to for example [[Architecture of Integrated Information Systems|ARIS]] and OMG's [[Model-driven architecture|MDA]] three levels are used:
# '''Business Level''': Here the processes to be automated are described from a technique independent level. In MDA this level is referred to as CIM level.
# '''Technical Level''': Here the IT concept is described. Therefore, the models from the first level are technically enriched, for example, instead of business functions now components are described, but still on a coarse-grained, conceptual level. Since the models on the second level represent the basis for an automated generation of executable code, they might have to be further adapted to fit implementation level constraints.
# '''Execution Level''': Here the models are machine interpretable and can be used during runtime in the execution of processes.

'''Axel Aubert''' (11 December 1873 – 16 December 1943) was a Norwegian chemical engineer who served as Director-General of [[Norsk Hydro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=  https://snl.no/Axel_Aubert|title=  Axel Aubert|publisher =  Store norske leksikon |accessdate= July 15,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (now Oslo, Norway). He was the son of  Otto Benjamin Andreas Aubert (1841–98) and  Hilda Thaulow (1846–1923).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   https://snl.no/Aubert |title=Aubert|publisher= Store norske leksikon|author=  Jon Gunnar Arntzen|accessdate= July 15,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;He studied  engineering, with specialization in chemistry. He first studied at the Oslo Technical College. He studied engineering at the [[University of Berlin]] and earned a [[doctorate]] in [[chemistry]] at the [[University of Basel]] in 1895. 

He became the managing director of Engene Dynamitfabrik and Norsk Sprængstofindustri. In 1926 he was hired as Director-General (CEO) of [[Norsk Hydro]]. In 1940, while Norway was still neutral in [[World War II]], Aubert was contacted by agents from French military intelligence regarding Norsk Hydro's production of [[heavy water]] ([[deuterium]] oxide) at its [[Vemork|Vemork hydroelectric plant]].  Heavy water was an important material for [[German nuclear weapon project|Germany's nuclear weapon project]] and was only produced in any quantities at Vemork. He agreed to 'lend' Norsk Hydro's entire existing stock of heavy water to France for the duration of the war, observing that if Germany won the war he was likely to be shot. The French agents [[Norwegian_heavy_water_sabotage#Pre-invasion_efforts|transported]] {{convert|185|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} of heavy water secretly to [[Oslo]], to [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in Scotland, and then to France.&lt;ref Name=Dahl1999&gt;{{cite book|last=Dahl|first=Per F|authorlink=| title=Heavy water and the wartime race for nuclear energy|publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing |year=1999|location=Bristol|pages=103–108|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MwD44jnjmmsC|doi=|isbn=07 5030 6335|accessdate=12 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aubert retired as Hydro president in late 1941, but took over as the company's chairman and held this position until his death in 1943. Aubert emphasized the scientific and technological research. He was a member of the Executive Board of the Norwegian Industry Association from 1926 to 1934. Aubert was appointed Knight of the 1st Class of the Norwegian [[Order of St. Olav]] in 1928. He also held the Belgium [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]],  the French [[Legion of Honour]],  the Danish [[Order of the Dannebrog]] and the Polish [[Order of Polonia Restituta]].

On July 5, 2018, [[Boeing]] and [[Embraer]] announced a [[joint venture]] for Embraer's [[airliner]]s, after [[Airbus]] acquired a majority of the competing [[Bombardier CSeries]] on October 16, 2017.

==History==

In December 2017, the [[Wall Street Journal]] reported [[Boeing]] has been in takeover talks with the 18,000 employee strong [[Embraer]], valuing it over its $3.7 billion [[market value]], awaiting [[Brazilian government]] approbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-held-takeover-talks-with-brazilian-aircraft-maker-embraer-1513874742 &lt;!-- alternate url: https://archive.is/20171221180220/https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-held-takeover-talks-with-brazilian-aircraft-maker-embraer-1513874742 --&gt; |title= Boeing Held Takeover Talks With Brazilian Aircraft Maker Embraer |author= Dana Mattioli,  Dana Cimilluca and Liz Hoffman |date= Dec 21, 2017 |work= Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The two companies confirmed that a potential combination was being discussed, with a transaction subject to approval by the Brazilian government and regulators, the two companies’ boards and shareholders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date= December 21, 2017 |title= Boeing and Embraer Confirm Discussions on Potential Combination}} [http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2017-12-21-Boeing-and-Embraer-Confirm-Discussions-on-Potential-Combination Boeing] and [https://embraer.com/global/en/news#/4113-boeing-and-embraer-confirm-discussions-on-potential-combination Embraer]&lt;/ref&gt;
The potential deal is seen as a reaction to the Airbus-Bombardier deal on the CSeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boeing Is in Talks for Combination With Regional-Jet Maker Embraer|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-21/boeing-is-said-in-talks-to-acquire-embraer-wsj-reports|accessdate=December 22, 2017|work=Bloomberg.com|date=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2017, Brazilian President [[Michel Temer]] said the sale of Embraer to Boeing was "out of the question", adding that the government is in favor of partnerships with the company, but warning that it will veto changes in stock control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://oglobo.globo.com/economia/nao-ha-menor-cogitacao-de-transferir-controle-da-embraer-diz-temer-22221325 |author= Letícia Fernandes e Manoel Ventura |title= Capital estrangeiro na Embraer é ‘muito bem-vindo’, diz Temer |date= Dec 22, 2017 |work= O Globo Journal |language= pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On December 28, defense minister [[Raul Jungmann]] opposed transferring control of Embraer SA as its the defense business cannot be separated from its commercial operations, but would welcome a deal maintaining local control of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-embraer-m-a-boeing/brazil-defense-ministry-opposes-giving-up-embraer-control-to-boeing-idUSKBN1EM1ET |date= Dec 28, 2017 |title= Brazil defense ministry opposes giving up Embraer control to Boeing |agency= Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 2, 2018, Brazilian newspaper [[Valor Econômico]] reported that forming [[joint venture]]s, sharing costs and income in definite areas, was preferable to avoid changing control of Embraer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-embraer-m-a-boeing/boeing-talks-not-considering-change-of-control-at-embraer-paper-idUSKBN1ER0RB |date= Jan 2, 2018 |title= Boeing talks not considering change of control at Embraer: paper |agency= Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Embraer’s engineers could work on Boeing’s future developments, the [[Boeing New Midsize Airplane|New Midsize Airplane (NMA)]] or a [[New Small Airplane]], but it wants to control at least Embraer's airliners to avoid repeating the [[B787]] debacle: it partnered with major [[subcontractor]]s and handed them engineering work, but those weren’t up to the task, resulting in unprecedented delays, overruns of billions of dollars and Boeing was forced to buy out some.&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes11jan2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeings-bid-to-buy-embraer-could-see-brazilian-engineers-work-on-the-797/ |title= Boeing’s bid to buy Embraer could see Brazilian engineers work on the 797 |date= January 11, 2018 |author= Dominic Gates |newspaper= The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 5, 2018, a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] was announced for a [[strategic partnership]]: for $3.8 billion Boeing will hold 80% of a [[joint venture]] for Embraers's [[airliner]]s and services, valued at $4.75 billion, and Embraer will own the remaining 20%.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=5jul2018PR&gt;--&gt;
It should generate $150 million [[Corporate synergy|synergies]] by year three and add to Boeing's [[earnings per share]] from 2020.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=5jul2018PR&gt;--&gt;
Boeing will control the new company, managed from [[Brazil]] and reporting to [[Dennis Muilenburg]], another [[Military|defense]] joint venture will market the [[KC-390]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=5jul2018PR&gt;--&gt;
After [[negotiation]] of definitive details, [[shareholder]] and [[regulatory]] approval is expected by the end of 2019.&lt;ref name=5jul2018PR&gt;{{cite press release |title= Boeing and Embraer to Establish Strategic Aerospace Partnership to Accelerate Global Aerospace Growth |date= July 5, 2018 |author= [http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2018-07-05-Boeing-and-Embraer-to-Establish-Strategic-Aerospace-Partnership-to-Accelerate-Global-Aerospace-Growth Boeing], [https://embraer.com/global/en/news#/1206396-boeing-and-embraer-to-establish-strategic-aerospace-partnership-to-accelerate-global-aerospace-growth Embraer]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The July 5 memorandum [[News leak|leak]]ed in October, the deadline to finalise the transaction is set for December 5, for a closure by the end of 2019.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight11oct2018&gt;--&gt;
Embraer would receive payments for five years before the joint venture would distribute 50% of its profits to shareholders.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight11oct2018&gt;--&gt;
A [[Lock-up period|lock-up]] agreement would prevent Embraer or Boeing from selling their shares for 10 years.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight11oct2018&gt;--&gt;
A [[put option]] would protect the minority stake value, allowing Embraer to sell its shares at the same price, inflation adjusted.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight11oct2018&gt;--&gt;
The new company scope include the designs, manufacturing, certification and sales of the ERJs, E-Jets and E-Jets E2.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight11oct2018&gt;--&gt;
Embraer will retain its executive [[business jet]] and its [[Defence industry|defence business]], but a joint venture for the KC-390 freighter will be explored.&lt;ref name=Flight11oct2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/embraer-boeing-agreement-lays-out-terms-of-proposed-452616/ |title= Embraer-Boeing agreement lays out terms of proposed joint venture |date= 11 Oct 2018 |author= Jon Hemmerdinger |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central Business District''' or Downtown is located in the heart of [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert's]] downtown core.  It is the dominant hub for retail, financial, personal and professional services in the city.  Only regional shopping centers are permitted in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=[[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|City of Prince Albert]]| title =How We Plan Now| url = http://www.citypa.ca/TheCity/Departments/EconomicDevelopmentandPlanning/ThePrinceAlbertDevelopmentPlanProcess/HowWePlanNow/tabid/344/Default.aspx%20CityPA.ca%20-%20How%20We%20Plan%20Now  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013119/http://www.citypa.ca/TheCity/Departments/EconomicDevelopmentandPlanning/ThePrinceAlbertDevelopmentPlanProcess/HowWePlanNow/tabid/344/Default.aspx%20CityPA.ca%20-%20How%20We%20Plan%20Now  | dead-url = yes  | archive-date = 2007-09-27  | accessdate =  2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many national businesses were housed in the area, but most have moved to other parts of the city.

It is located from 2nd Ave West - Central Avenue and extends between 2nd and 3rd Avenue East.  It also goes from 15th Street and goes to River Street.  The Central Business District is situated in Midtown.  Plus it is home to many local businesses, civil, provincial, and federal government services.

In the downtown of Prince Albert, many buildings are of architectural and historic value and interest still remain.&lt;sup&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013127/http://www.citypa.ca/Portals/0/PDF/EconPlan/2005%20Downtown%20Strategic%20Plan.pdf]&lt;/sup&gt;  Urban city planners as well as landscape architects have a concept of growth and development for the Prince Albert downtown area which will come to fruition in the year 2020.&lt;ref name=downtown&gt;{{Cite web|last = Armin A.

'''Claudio Strunz''' (born December 13, 1971) is an Argentine thrash metal drummer. He has worked in Heinkel, [[Hermética]], [[Malón (band)|Malón]] and Simbiosis.

==Biography==
Claudio Strunz, born in [[La Tablada]], began his career in Heinkel, a band that would be renamed [[Jeriko]]. The band's rehearsal room was located in the [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires|Belgrano]] neighbourhood, which was very distant, so he created a new one at his home. [[El Reloj]] hired this rehearsal room as well. He created later a new one in [[Mataderos]], which was hired by the thrash metal band [[Hermética]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/no/12-596-2003-03-03.html|title= Sin vecinos cerca, por favor|trans-title=No neighbors allowed, please|language= Spanish|author= Miguel Mora|date= February 27, 2003|work= |publisher= Página 12|accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played with that band during tests when the drummer [[Tony Scotto]] was absent. As a result, when Scotto left the band Strunz was selected as the new drummer. He joined the band in 1991, just in time for the recording of the LP ''[[Ácido Argentino]]'', and stayed with the band since then. Hermética received a [[Music recording sales certification|golden record]] for the sales of ''Ácido Argentino'', and a second one for the 1994 CD ''[[Víctimas del Vaciamiento]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Blumetti, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermética broke up in 1994, in controversial circumstances. Bassist [[Ricardo Iorio]] created a new band, [[Almafuerte (band)|Almafuerte]], with new musicians. Strunz, guitarist [[Antonio Romano (musician)|Antonio Romano]] and singer [[Claudio O'Connor]], the remaining members of the band, created the band [[Malón (band)|Malón]] with a new bassist, Carlos Kuadrado. The new band had a [[thrash metal]] style similar to Hermética. They recorded two studio CDs and one live CD. Strunz made a guest appearance in the song "Ardiendo en el cielo" of "Tierra Violada", the first CD of Jeriko. He was the producer of the CD, as well as with their second CD, "Tensiones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/no/12-5498-2011-06-14.html|title= Cromañón frenó al metal|trans-title=Cromañon stopped metal|language= Spanish|author= Juan Ignacio Provéndola|date= June 9, 2011|work= |publisher= Página 12|accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malón broke up in 1998, after the departure of O'Connor. Strunz created the [[grunge]] band ''Simbiosis'', which had little success. With his previous experience, he created "Asbury Park", a complex of rehearsal rooms. He tried to reunite Malón with Romano and Kuadrado; O'Connor refused to join them. The band broke up again, and Strunz claimed the copyright over the name of the band, forbidding it to continue without him. The band reunited again in 2011, this time with all the original members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1433294-malon-vuelve-hermetica-aun-no|title= Malón vuelve; Hermética... aún no|trans-title=Malón returns; Hermética... not yet|language= Spanish|author= Sebastián Esposito|date= December 17, 2011|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colm O'Rourke''' (born 31 August 1957) is a retired [[Gaelic football]]er and current [[Sports broadcasting|sports broadcaster]]. His [[National Football League (Ireland)|league]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|championship]] career with the [[Meath GAA|Meath]] senior team spanned twenty years from 1975 to 1995.

Born in Aughavas, [[County Leitrim]], O'Rourke was raised in [[Skryne]], [[County Meath]] after his family moved there in his youth. He played competitive Gaelic football during his schooling at [[St Patrick's Classical School|St. Patrick's Classical School]] in [[Navan]]. O'Rourke first appeared for the [[Skryne GFC|Skryne]] club at underage levels, before winning two [[Meath Senior Football Championship|county senior championship]] medals in 1992 and 1993. While studying at [[University College Dublin]] he won a [[Sigerson Cup]] medal in 1979.

O'Rourke made his debut on the inter-county scene when he was picked for the Meath minor team. He later joined the under-21 side but enjoyed little success in these grades. O'Rourke made his senior debut during the [[1975-76 National Football League (Ireland)|1975-76 league]]. Over the course of the next twenty years he was a regular member of the starting fifteen and won back-to-back [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland]] medals in 1987 and 1988. He also won five [[Leinster Senior Football Championship|Leinster]] medals, three [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] medals and was named [[Texaco Footballer of the Year|Footballer of the Year]] in 1991. O'Rourke played his last game for Meath in July 1995.

In retirement from playing O'Rourke combined his teaching career with a new position as a sports broadcaster. His media career began with [[RTÉ]] where he has worked as a studio analyst with the flagship programme ''[[the Sunday Game]]'' for over twenty-five years. O'Rourke also writes a weekly column for the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]''.

==Personal life==
Despite becoming an inter-county Meath footballer, O'Rourke is not a Meathman by birth; he was born in the small parish of Aughavas within [[County Leitrim]].&lt;ref name="HoganStand"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hoganstand.com/Meath/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=48494 | title = Colm O'Rourke Happy 51st | work=The Hogan Stand | publisher = Lynn Publications | date = 13 September 1991 | accessdate=16 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved with his family as a youngster from Leitrim to [[County Meath]]

O'Rourke is a descendant of the Uí Ruairc royal house of [[Breffni]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} He has, however, been accepted by the people of [[Skryne]] in Meath as one of their own forty years after arriving from Aughavas. He is the secondary school principal in [[St. Patrick's Classical School (Navan)|St. Patrick's Classical School]] in [[Navan]] where he has trained the Gaelic football team to numerous successes at provincial and national level throughout the past two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Yearbook of St. Patrick's Classical School, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also managed Colm O'Rourke Sports, his own sports shop in Navan Shopping Centre, during this period. He started working for RTÉ on [[The Sunday Game]] in 1991, and has been a contributor to sports columns in national newspapers. He is continuously being linked with managing the Meath senior football team, previously held by [[Seán Boylan]], another man with [[County Leitrim|Leitrim]] connections.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} O'Rourke's son [[Shane O'Rourke|Shane]] also played with the Meath senior football team, while his nephew [[Patrick O'Rourke (Gaelic footballer)|Paddy]] has played as a goalkeeper for Meath.

==Playing career==
As a Gaelic footballer, O'Rourke won two [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland]] medals with Meath, in 1987 and 1988. He also won five [[Leinster Senior Football Championship]] medals and three [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] titles.

O'Rourke received three All-Star for Meath in 1983, 1988 and 1991. His performance, playing with a bandaged knee, in the Dublin-Meath matches of the summer of 1991 are still recounted in Meath.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} When playing for Meath he was part of a full forward line of himself, [[Brian Stafford]] and [[Bernard Flynn]], often considered to be one of the best full-forward lines of all time.

==Management career==
O'Rourke has managed Simonstown Gaels GFC in Navan, guiding them to two Meath Senior Football Finals in 2003 and 2004, only for the team to lose on both occasions. He also guided the club to its first adult title in 2005 when it won the Meath Football League Division 1.

O'Rourke managed Ireland's team that competed in the [[International rules football|Compromise Rules]] competition on two outings, 1998 and 1999.

O'Rourke is currently{{when|date=June 2018}} the manager for the Senior men's team in St. Patrick's Classical School, they compete in the A division and in 2001, 2003 and 2004 they won the Hogan cup in the All-Ireland, they have got to the All-Ireland many of a time more recently in 2013.

He studied business administration at the [[European Business School International University Schloss Reichartshausen|European Business School]] in [[Oestrich-Winkel]] as well as the [[European Business School Paris|Paris Business School]] and the [[University of Colorado]].&lt;ref name=Mountain&gt;[http://www.mountain-partners.de/de/team/verwaltungsrat/238-dr-cornelius-boersch.html Dr. Cornelius Boersch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208053800/http://www.mountain-partners.de/de/team/verwaltungsrat/238-dr-cornelius-boersch.html |date=2011-02-08 }} at Mountain Partners Group, retrieved 15 February 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 he completed his PhD at the [[University of Duisburg-Essen]] with a thesis on "Mutual savings banks and Venture Capital".&lt;ref&gt;''Kreditgenossenschaften und Risikokapital - unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des genossenschaftlichen Förderauftrages'', [http://www.wiwi.uni-due.de/alter-wiwi-auftritt/forschung/promotionen/sort-author-asc/ Universität Duisburg-Essen]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1986">The '''Corps of Military Accountants''' was a short-lived [[corps]] of the [[British Army]]. It was formed in November 1919 and disbanded in July 1925. Its members handled financial matters, although matters relating to [[Payroll|pay]] continued to be handled by the [[Royal Army Pay Corps]].

All personnel serving as Military Accountant Officers and Military Accountant Clerks transferred to the new corps.&lt;ref name=new&gt;"New Corps Of Military Accountants", ''[[The Times]]'', 25 November 1919&lt;/ref&gt; On the disbandment of the corps most of its personnel who chose to stay in the Army either reverted to their previous regiments and corps or transferred to the RAPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1925/dec/01/corps-of-military-accountants#S5CV0188P0_19251201_HOC_85|date=1 December 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appointments==
Officers, who held a minimum rank of Captain and were mostly qualified [[accountant]]s, held appointments depending on rank, although they continued to use their normal ranks in day-to-day military life.&lt;ref name=new /&gt;

'''De'Longhi S.p.A''' is an Italian [[small appliance]] manufacturer&lt;ref name=Routers /&gt; based in [[Treviso]], [[Italy]].

== History and trading ==
The company was founded by the De' Longhi family in 1902 as a small industrial parts manufacturing workshop. The company incorporated in 1950. Historically a major producer of portable heaters and air conditioners, the company has expanded to include nearly every category of small domestic appliances in the food preparation and cooking, as well as household cleaning and ironing, segments. De'Longhi is especially well known for the Artista Series espresso machines, the De'Longhi gelato maker and the Pinguino portable air conditioner.

De'Longhi is known for the design of its products. Its Esclusivo line of kitchen appliances won the [[Red Dot]] design award in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=De'Longhi's Esclusivo range wins two international design gongs - Cur…|url=http://www.current.com.au/2007/03/06/article/TEJNKAFEFJ|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121230111147/http://www.current.com.au/2007/03/06/article/TEJNKAFEFJ|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 December 2012|website=archive.is|accessdate=10 February 2017|date=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Home Furnishing News'' recognized De'Longhi Design Director Giocomo Borin as one of the 50 most influential designers in the world in 2006.

De'Longhi's 2000 acquisition of [[Climaveneta]] SpA and DLRadiators allowed De'Longhi to enter the commercial [[HVACR]] (Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning and Refrigeration) market.

De'Longhi's £45.9 million&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/4482351/Kenwood-cooks-up-a-45.9m-deal-with-Italys-DeLonghi.html ''Kenwood cooks up a £45.9m deal with Italy's De'Longhi'', Dominic White, Daily Telegraph, London, 17 February 2001].Retrieved 25 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; (about $66.7 million) 2001 acquisition of the British appliance maker [[Kenwood Limited|Kenwood]] gave De'Longhi access to Kenwood's Chinese factory. As a result, many of De'Longhi's products are now imported from [[People's Republic of China|China]], while design and engineering remain largely in Italy.

Acquisition of a majority stake in RC Group, a leading player in information technology cooling, in 2006 has strengthened De'Longhi's presence in the HVACR market.

In all, De'Longhi operates 13 production facilities and 30 international subsidiaries that support sales to 75 countries worldwide. International sales account for nearly 75 percent of the group's total revenues, which topped [[€]]1.63 billion in 2010.

On 2 January 2012 the [[DeLclima]] group was set up as a demerger from De'Longhi.

On 16 April 2012, De'Longhi bought perpetual rights to manufacture [[Braun (company)|Braun]] branded products from [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] in the small appliance segment. Procter &amp; Gamble will continue to own the Braun brand.  €50 million was paid immediately and €90 million will be paid over the next 15 years.&lt;ref name=Routers&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/16/us-delonghi-idUSBRE83F06B20120416 |title=Italy's De'Longhi buys Braun brand license &amp;#124; Reuters |work=reuters.com |year=2012 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shares in the company are traded on [[Borsa Italiana|Milan's stock exchange]].

In October 2017, the [[Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America]] and Allergy Standards Limited announced that five  De'Longhi dehumidifiers have earned the [[Asthma and Allergy Friendly]] Certification. These are the first dehumidifiers to receive the program’s mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=GlobeNewswire | date=16 October 2017| title=Reducing Humidity Creates Healthier Homes for Those With Asthma and Allergies | url=http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/10/16/1147969/0/en/Reducing-Humidity-Creates-Healthier-Homes-for-Those-With-Asthma-and-Allergies.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6157">[[Image:Deloss Walker - painted portrait.JPG|frame|Deloss Walker, founder of Walker + Associates, Inc.]]
'''Vernon Deloss Walker''' (August 14, 1931 – April 19, 1996) was a notable advertising executive and political campaign consultant. Walker founded the [[Memphis, Tennessee]]-based advertising firm Walker + Associates, Inc. in October 1965. Walker played a major role in politics, corporate marketing and philanthropy throughout the South from the 1960s to 1990s.

==Political campaign consulting==
Noted by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as a political Media Mesmerist,&lt;ref&gt;"The Media Mesmerists" ''Time'', October 30, 1978, www.time.com&lt;/ref&gt; Walker and his firm consulted with and managed the successful campaigns of some of the South’s most preeminent politicians, including [[Albert Gore Jr.]] and [[Jim Sasser]] of Tennessee, [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Dale Bumpers]] of Arkansas, [[Fob James]] of Alabama, and [[Joe Frank Harris]] of Georgia.

Recalling Alabama's 1978 Governor’s race in which Fob James defeated a number of seasoned political veterans, Alabama political columnist Steve Flowers wrote, "Fob realized he was no political professional ...&amp;nbsp;so he sought out professional advice. He had the money to think big and wanted to know who the best political consultant in the South was. It was an easy answer: Deloss Walker, a political public relations genius who lived in Memphis, Tenn. His track record for electing governors of southern states was 5–0. The scenario was the same for all five upset victories. He took an obscure, unknown candidate and elected him governor over a well-known incumbent or favorite. He had just taken an unknown school board member named Dale Bumpers and made him Governor of Arkansas. Deloss Walker was the most renowned and expensive political guru in the country in 1977."&lt;ref&gt;"The 1978 Governor’s Race was Certainly One for the Record Books" Steve Flowers, October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1998 autobiography Joe Frank Harris, ''Personal Reflections on a Public Life'', the former Governor of Georgia recalls the hiring of Deloss Walker and Walker + Associates to run his campaign in 1982: "The broadcast and newspaper media are, of course, a potent force, and if you can gain access to them effectively and with enough repetition, you can move name identification along very quickly. We were able to do that with the assistance of Deloss Walker and Walker and Associates, a public relations group from Memphis, Tennessee whom I had met though a mutual friend…At the time we signed on Deloss had handled some fifty political campaigns and had won all but two of them."&lt;ref&gt;Joe Frank Harris, ''Personal Reflections on a Public Life'', Mercer University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising agency leader==
Deloss Walker's firm, Walker + Associates, Inc. has served a variety of notable clients, including the regional co-op for [[McDonald's]], the Tennessee Department of Tourist Development, and [[Lucite]] International. In 1987, Deloss Walker was named the Silver Medal Award&lt;ref name="memphisadfed.org"&gt;http://www.memphisadfed.org&lt;/ref&gt; winner. The award is the Memphis Advertising Federation's&lt;ref name="memphisadfed.org"/&gt; highest honor, recognizing an "entire career of outstanding accomplishment and contribution in advertising."

Since 1996, the firm has been led by president and chief executive officer Ceil Walker.&lt;ref&gt;"40 Years and Counting – Walker + Associates Makes its Mark in Satisfaction, Longevity" The Commercial Appeal, December 23, 2007, www.commercialappeal.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"After Deloss" The Memphis Flyer, February 5, 1998, wwwmemphisflyer.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Deloss Walker was born in [[O'Kean, Arkansas|O'Kean, AR.]]   He attended Southern Baptist College, in Walnut Ridge, Ark. Walker served in the [[Korean War]] and was awarded the [[Bronze Star]] in combat in the [[battle of Heartbreak Ridge]]. Before founding Walker + Associates, Inc. advertising agency, Deloss Walker was general manager of [[Jonesboro, Arkansas]] radio station [[KNEA]].&lt;ref&gt;"Deloss Walker, Ad Expert, Political Strategist, Dies" ''The Commercial Appeal'', April 20, 1996, www.commercialappeal.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community involvement==
Deloss Walker led or supported many initiatives to improve the community. In 1996, the Memphis Symphony honored Deloss and Ceil Walker with the Hebe Award for outstanding contributions and service to the arts. That year, well-known historian [[Shelby Foote]] was also honored by the Symphony with its Amphion Award.&lt;ref&gt;"Symphony Ball to Honor Foote, Walkers" ''The Commercial Appeal'', October 19, 1996, www.commercialappeal.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walker + Associates today==
The communications agency Deloss Walker founded in 1965 continues to operate today. In fact, many of Walker + Associates' clients have stayed with the agency long-term, including McDonald's, which has been a client for more than 23 years.&lt;ref&gt;"Walker and Associates Honored for Work with McDonald's" ''Memphis Business Journal'', August 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency continues to win industry awards such as International MarCom Creative, Communicator, ADDY, and VOX awards, among others. On March 30, 2013, the Commercial Appeal highlighted four awards (two ADDYs and two International MarCom Creative Awards) given to Walker + Associates  for videos created for the DeSoto County (Miss.) CVB / Tourism Association.&lt;ref&gt;"Commercial Appeal", March 30, 2013, http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2013/mar/30/desoto-tourism-gets-4-awards-for-videos/&lt;/ref&gt; On March 13, 2009, the Memphis Business Journal highlighted Walker + Associates' platinum International MarCom award for a movie poster parody titled "No Country for Old Couches."&lt;ref&gt;"Walker &amp; Associates wins big with ‘No Country for Old Men’ parody," ''Memphis Business Journal'', March 13, 2009, http://memphis.bizjournals.com/memphis/stories/2009/03/16/tidbits1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Donald Barrett''' is the founder and president of [[ITV Direct]], a company which produces [[infomercial]]s for broadcast in the United States. Almost all are related to health and nutrition, or in the company's words, "products that positively impact people."{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  He has also promoted [[Lorraine Day]], and other alternative medical practitioners.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  He founded ITV Ventures, an affiliate company which offers the public network marketing opportunities connected to its infomercial business.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ITV closed on October 3, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120919144719/http://www.salemnews.com/permalink/local_story_277005230.html The Salem News, Vendors: ITV No Longer in Business, Cate Lecuyer, October 3, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2013, Barrett became the co-host of Unspoken Cures Radio, along with Matthew Ryncarz. Unspoken Cures Radio used to be known as Fusion Power Hour, and is broadcast on the Arena Sports Network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thearenasportsnetwork.com/asn-shows/fusion-power-hour.html Fusion Power Hour on The Arena Sports Network] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211201608/http://thearenasportsnetwork.com/asn-shows/fusion-power-hour.html |date=December 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pr.com/press-release/517797 Arena Sports Network Announces Airing of Fusion Power Hour]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
On April 19, 2004, Barrett in his capacity as President of ITV Direct, Inc./Direct Marketing Concepts, Inc. received a [[FDA Warning Letter|Warning Letter]] from the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) notifying him that the product Supreme Greens was being marketed as an unlicensed drug with false or misleading claims.  The letter requested that ITV Direct correct the deceptive practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casewatch.org/fdawarning/prod/2004/sg.shtml Warning Letter, April 19, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging that Direct Marketing Concepts, Inc., ITV Direct, Inc., and their president, Donald W. Barrett had deceptively marketed Supreme Greens and Coral Calcium Daily by claiming that it could prevent, treat, and cure cancer, heart disease, arthritis, and diabetes.  They also claimed it caused substantial weight loss, and was safe for use by pregnant women, children – including those as young as one year old, and persons taking any form of medication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2005/10/supreme.shtm Federal Trade Commission news release, October 6, 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422065534/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2005/10/supreme.shtm |date=April 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2004, ITV Direct was enjoined from marketing Supreme Greens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/07/dmc.shtm FTC Obtains Preliminary Injunction Against Marketers of Bogus Cancer-Cure "Supreme Greens", July 1, 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418092609/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/07/dmc.shtm |date=April 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, 2007, the FTC sued ITV Direct, Inc. and Donald Barrett for misrepresenting [[Kevin Trudeau]]'s "Weight-Loss Cure" book in the infomercial they produced to market it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2007/10/weight.shtm FTC Charges Marketers of “Weight-Loss Cure” Book with Misrepresenting Book’s Contents, October 5, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the FTC's suit, ITV Direct sued the FTC for alleged harassment and violation of free speech rights.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Subsequently, on November 19, 2007, in a separate FTC action, Trudeau was found in [[contempt of court|contempt]] of a 2004 court order for making "patently false" claims in the weight loss book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/business/20071119-1334-ftc-trudeau.html Court finds ''Natural Cures' author Trudeau in contempt of 2004 settlement, may be fined again'' Christopher S.

On July 19, 2008, a federal judge ruled that two infomercials produced by Beverly-based ITV Direct for "Coral Calcium" and "Supreme Greens" were deceptive and that the firm's owners are liable for restitution being sought by the Federal Trade Commission, which is seeking nearly $55 million.  The judge also dismissed a countersuit filed by Barrett, ITV's president, who claimed the FTC was violating his First Amendment rights by taking him to court to force him to pull the ads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120717012953/http://salemnews.com/punews/local_story_200202510.html  Judge finds Beverly company's promise to cure cancer in infomercials 'deceptive', The Salem News, July 19, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eugenio López Alonso''' is the President of Fundación Jumex Arte Contemporáneo and a contemporary art collector.

He has worked in the realm of contemporary art collecting in Mexico since the late 1990s, focusing on the promotion of contemporary art practice and on fostering its development. In 2001 he created Fundación Jumex, a not-for-profit institution that receives support from [[Grupo Jumex]], a company founded by his father, Eugenio López Rodea. The creation of [[Museo Jumex]] in 2013 has further established López’s influence in the international cultural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times (Agosto, 2017),[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/arts/design/a-mexican-showcase-for-ambition.html] A Mexican Showcase for Ambition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:131117 jumex def 121.jpg|thumb|Museo Jumex]]

His work has been recognized through his continual support of different museums in Mexico in their programming of educational activities, publications related to the visual arts, and through the grants and scholarships that Fundación Jumex awards every year to curators and artists for postgraduate studies abroad.

Eugenio López is currently a member of the board of trustees of other institutions in Mexico like [[Museo Tamayo Arte Contemporáneo]], [[Museo de Arte Moderno]] and Patronato de Arte Contemporáneo (PAC). In the US, López is on the board of trustees of the [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]] in New York and of Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA). It is thanks to his interest in contemporary Latin American art that the MOCA established the JUMEX FUND. He has also supported the making of exhibitions and publications at [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, The Moore Space, Miami, and Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and the [[Hammer Museum]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Mundo Ejecutivo (Agosto, 2017),[http://mundoejecutivo.com.mx/economia-negocios/2017/08/09/eugenio-lopez-le-saca-jugo-negocios].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Guanxi''''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|關係}}}}) defines the rudimentary dynamic in personalized [[social network]]s of power (which can be best described as the relationships individuals cultivate with other individuals) and is a crucial system of beliefs in [[Chinese culture]]. In Western media, the [[pinyin]] romanization of this Chinese word is becoming more widely used instead of the two common translations of it—"connections" and "relationships"—as neither of those terms sufficiently reflects the wide cultural implications that ''guanxi'' describes.&lt;ref name="Gold, Thomas 2002"&gt;Gold, Thomas, Douglas Guthrie, and David Wank. 2002. ''Social Connections in China: Institutions, Culture and the Changing Nature of Guanxi.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Guanxi'' plays a fundamental role within the Confucian doctrine, which sees the individual as part of a community and a set of family, hierarchical and friendly relationships. In particular, there is a focus on tacit mutual commitments, [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], and trust, which are the grounds of ''guanxi'' and ''guanxi'' networks.&lt;ref&gt;Luo, Yadong, Ying Huang, and Stephanie Lu Wang. "Guanxi and Organisational Performance: A Meta-Analysis." ''Management and Organization Review'' 8.1 (2011): 139-72. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Guanxi'' also has a major influence on the management of businesses based in Mainland China, and businesses owned by [[Overseas Chinese]] in Southeast Asia (the latter is known as the [[bamboo network]]).&lt;ref name="Yeung"&gt;{{cite book|author=H. W-c Yeung|title=Handbook of Research on Asian Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTfWutnFbfkC&amp;pg=PA412|year=2007|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84720-318-2|page=412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely related concepts include that of ''[[ganqing]]'', a measure which reflects the depth of feeling within an interpersonal relationship, ''renqing'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|[[wikt:人情|人情]]}} ''rénqíng''/''jen-ch'ing''), the moral obligation to maintain a relationship, and the idea of "[[Face (social custom)|face]]" ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|面子}}, ''miànzi''/''mien-tzu''), which refers to social status, propriety, prestige, or a combination of all three. Other related concepts include ''wu-lune'', which supports the idea of a long term, developing relationship between a business and its client, ''and yi-ren'' and ''ren'', which respectively support reciprocity and empathy.

==Description and usage==
===In a personal context===
At its most basic, ''guanxi'' describes a personal connection between two people in which one is able to prevail upon another to perform a favor or service, or be prevailed upon, that is, one's ''standing'' with another. The two people need not be of equal [[social status]]. ''Guanxi'' can also be used to describe a network of contacts, which an individual can call upon when something needs to be done, and through which he or she can exert influence on behalf of another.

''Guanxi'' also refers to the benefits gained from social connections and usually extends from extended family, school friends, workmates and members of common clubs or organizations. It is customary for Chinese people to cultivate an intricate web of ''guanxi'' relationships, which may expand in a huge number of directions, and includes lifelong relationships. Staying in contact with members of your network is not necessary to bind reciprocal obligations. Reciprocal favors are the key factor to maintaining one’s ''guanxi'' web, while failure to reciprocate is considered an unforgivable offense (that is, the more one asks of someone, the more one owes them). ''Guanxi'' can perpetuate a never-ending cycle of favors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ostrowski|first=Pierre|title=It's all Chinese to Me: an overview of culture &amp; etiquette in China|year=2009|publisher=Tuttle|isbn=978-0-8048-4079-8|pages=48–49|author2=Gwen Penner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is not generally used to describe interpersonal relationships within a family, although ''guanxi'' obligations can sometimes be described in terms of an extended family. Essentially, familial relations are the core of one’s interpersonal relations, while the various non-familial interpersonal relations are modifications or extensions of the familial relations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Chinese culture's emphasis on familial relations informs ''guanxi'' as well, making it such that both familial relations and non-familial interpersonal relations are grounded by similar behavioral norms.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hsuing, Bingyuan. “Guanxi: Personal connections in Chinese society.” ''Journal of Bioeconomics'' 15.1 (2013): 17-40. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; An individual may view and interact with other individuals in a way that is similar to their viewing of and interactions with family members; through ''guanxi'', a relationship between two friends can be likened by each friend to being a pseudo elder sibling–younger sibling relationship, with each friend acting accordingly based on that relationship (the friend who sees himself as the "younger sibling" will show more deference to the friend who is the "older sibling"). ''Guanxi'' is also based in concepts like loyalty, dedication, reciprocity, and trust, which help to develop non-familial interpersonal relations, while mirroring the concept of filial piety, which is used to ground familial relations.

Ultimately, the relationships formed by ''guanxi'' are personal and not transferable.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

===In a business context===
In China, a country where business relations are highly socially embedded, ''guanxi'' plays a central role in the shaping and development of day-to-day business transactions by allowing inter-business relationships and relationships between businesses and the government to grow as individuals representing these organizations work with one another. Specifically, in a business context, ''guanxi'' occurs through individual interactions first before being applied on a corporate level (ex. one member of a business may perform a favor for a member of another business because they have interpersonal ties, which helps to facilitate the relationship between the two businesses involved in this interaction).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Flora F. Gu, Kineta Hung, David K. Tse. “When Does Guanxi Matter? Issues of Capitalization and Its Dark Sides.” ''Journal of Marketing'' 72.4 (2008): 12-28. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Guanxi'' also acts as an essential informal governance mechanism, helping leverage Chinese organizations on social and economic platforms. In places in China where institutions, like the structuring of local governments and government policies, may make business interactions less efficient to facilitate, ''guanxi'' can serve as a way for businesses to circumvent such institutions by having their members cultivate their interpersonal ties.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasmath|first=Reza|last2=Ho|first2=Benjamin|date=2015|title=Job acquisition, retention, and outcomes for ethnic minorities in urban China|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15387216.2015.1049637|journal=Eurasian Geography and Economics|volume=56|issue=1|pages=29–30|doi=10.1080/15387216.2015.1049637|issn=1538-7216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, ''guanxi'' is important in two domains: 1) social ties with managers of suppliers, buyers, competitors, and other business intermediaries; and 2) social ties with government officials at various national government-regulated agencies. Given its extensive influential power in the shaping of business operations, many see ''guanxi'' as a crucial source of social capital and strategic tool for business success.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thanks to a good knowledge of ''guanxi'', companies obtain secret information, increase their knowledge about precise government regulations, and receive privileged access to stocks and resources. Knowing this, some economists have warned that Western countries and others that trade regularly with China should improve their "cultural competency" in regards to practices such as ''guanxi''. In doing so, such countries can avoid financial fallout caused by a lack of awareness regarding the way practices like ''guanxi'' operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://montrealgazette.com/mobile/business/fp-business/Links+with+China+bring+long+term+pain+study/7203689/story.html|title = Dancing with the Dragon: Canadian Investment in China and Chinese Investment in Canada|date = September 2012|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Smart|first = Josephine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of ''guanxi'', however, can also form the basis of [[patronage|patron–client relations]]. As a result, it creates challenges for businesses whose members are obligated to repay favors to members of other businesses when they cannot sufficiently do so. In following these obligations, businesses may also be forced to act in ways detrimental to their future, and start to over-rely on each other. Members within a business may also start to more frequently discuss information that all members knew prior, rather than try and discuss information only known by select members. If the ties fail between two businesses within an overall network built through ''guanxi'', the other ties comprising the overall network have a chance of failing as well.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A ''guanxi'' network may also violate [[bureaucratic]] norms, leading to corporate corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The changing Chinese culture and business behavior: The perspective of intertwinement between guanxi and corruption|date = 2008-02-02|last = Luo|first = Yadong|doi=10.1016/j.ibusrev.2008.02.002|volume=17|journal=International Business Review|pages=188–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the aforementioned organizational flaws ''guanxi'' creates can be diminished by having more efficient institutions (like open market systems that are regulated by formal organizational procedures while promoting competition and innovation) in place to help facilitate business interactions more effectually.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In East Asian societies the boundary between business and social lives can sometimes be ambiguous as people tend to rely heavily on their closer relations and friends. This can result in [[nepotism]] in the work force being created through ''guanxi'', as it is common for authoritative figures to draw from family and close ties to fill employment opportunities, instead of assessing talent and suitability as is the norm in Western societies. This practice often prevents the most suitably qualified person being employed for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jun|first=Lin|author2=Steven X. Si|title=Can guanxi be a problem? Contexts, ties, and some unfavorable consequences of social capital in China|journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Management|year=2010|volume=27|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''guanxi'' only becomes nepotism when individuals start to value their interpersonal relationships as ways to accomplish their goals over the relationships themselves.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Verhezen, Peter. "''Guanxi'': Networks or Nepotism?: ''The dark side of business networks''." ''Europe-Asia Dialogue on Business Spirituality''. Ed. Laszlo Zsolnai. Antwerpen: Garant, 2008. 89-106. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; When interpersonal relationships are seen in this light, then, it is usually the case that individuals are not viewing their cultivation of prospective business relationships without bias. In addition, ''guanxi'' and nepotism are distinct in that the former is inherently a social transaction (considering the emphasis on the actual act of building relationships) and not purely based in financial transactions, while the latter is explicitly based in financial transactions and has a higher chance of resulting in legal consequences.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However croneyism is less obvious and can lead to low risk sycophancy and empire building bureaucracy within the internal politics of an organisation.

===In a political context===
For relationship-based networks such as ''guanxi'', reputation plays an important role in shaping interpersonal and political relations. As a result, the government is still the most important stakeholder, despite the nation's recent efforts to minimise government involvement. Key government officials wield the authority to choose political associates and allies, approve projects, allocate resources, and distribute finances. Thus, it is especially crucial for international companies to develop harmonious personal relationships with government officials. In addition to holding major legislative power, the Chinese government owns vital resources including land, banks, and major media networks and wields major influence over other stakeholders. Thus, it is important to maintain good relations with the central government in order for a business to maintain ''guanxi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/02634500710774969|title = "Gūanxi ", government and corporate reputation in China: Lessons for international companies|last = Ying|first = Fan|date = 2007|journal = Marketing Intelligence &amp; Planning|doi = 10.1108/02634500710774969|pmid = |access-date =|volume=25|pages=499–510}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the issue of ''guanxi'' as a form of government corruption has been raised into question over the recent years. This is often the case when businessmen interpret ''guanxi''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s reciprocal obligations as unethical gift giving in exchange for government approval. The line drawn between ethical and unethical reciprocal obligation is unclear, but the nation currently is looking into understanding the structural problems inherent in the ''guanxi'' system.&lt;ref name="Harding 2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?shr=t&amp;csi=142678&amp;sr=TITLE(%22Corruption%20or%20guanxi?%20Differentiating%20between%20the%20legitimate,%20unethical,%20and%20corrupt%20activities%20of%20Chinese%20government%20officials%22)%20and%20date%20is%202014|title = CORRUPTION OR GUANXI?

==Ethical concerns==
In recent years, the ethical consequences of ''guanxi'' have been brought into question. While ''guanxi'' can bring benefits to people directly within the ''guanxi'' network, it also has the potential to bring harm to individuals, societies and nations when misused or abused. For example, mutual reciprocal obligation is a major component of ''guanxi''. However, the specific date, time and method are often unspecified. Thus, ''guanxi'' can be ethically questionable when one party takes advantage of others’ personal favors, without seeking to reciprocate.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis B. Hwang, Patricia L. Golemon, Yan Chen, Teng-Shih Wang and Wen-Shai Hung. "Guanxi and Business Ethics in Confucian Society Today: An Empirical Case Study in Taiwan." ''Journal of Business Ethics'' 89.2 (2009): 235-250. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A common example of unethical reciprocal obligation involves the abuse of business-government relations. In 2013, a CCP (Chinese Communist Party) official criticised the government officials for using public funds of over 10,000 yuan for banquets. This totals to approximately 48 billion dollars worth of banquets per year.&lt;ref name="Harding 2014"/&gt; ''Guanxi'' may also allow for interpersonal obligations to take precedence over civic duties.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation
  |last = Ansfield|first = Jonathan|title = Where Guanxi Rules|newspaper = Newsweek|date = December 17, 2007|url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/74369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guanxi is a neutral word, but the use or practice of guanxi can range from 'benign, neutral, to questionable and corruptive'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fan | first1 = Ying | year = 2002 | title = Ganxi's Consequences: Personal Gains at Social Cost | url = | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 371–80 [378] | doi=10.1023/a:1016021706308}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mainland China, terms like guanxi practice or ''la'' guanxi are used to refer to bribery and corruption.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = L | year = 2011 | title = Performing Bribery in China: guanxi-practice, corruption with a human face | url = https://zenodo.org/record/895341/files/article.pdf| journal = Journal of Contemporary China | volume = 20 | issue = 68| pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1080/10670564.2011.520841}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guanxi practice is commonly employed by favour seekers to seek corrupt benefits from power-holders. Guanxi offers an efficient information transmission channel to help guanxi members to identify potential and trustworthy partners; it also offers safe and secret platform for illegal tansactions. Guanxi norms help buyers and sellers of corrupt benefits justify and rationalize their acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhan | first1 = J. V. | year = 2012 | title = Filling the gap of formal institutions: the effects of Guanxi network on corruption in reform-era China | url = | journal = Crime, law and social change | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 93–109 | doi=10.1007/s10611-012-9379-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Li' ''Performing bribery in China''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; as well as Wang's ''the buying and selling of public offices''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = P | year = 2016 | title = Military corruption in China: the role of guanxi in the buying and selling of military positions | url = | journal = The China Quarterly | volume = 228 | issue = | page = 970 | doi=10.1017/s0305741016001144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Peng (2017). The Chinese Mafia: Organized Crime, Corruption, and Extra-Legal Protection. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; supply essential analyses on how guanxi practice works in corrupt exchanges.

This question is especially critical in cross-cultural business partnerships, when Western firms and auditors are operating within Confucian cultures. Western-based managers must exercise caution in determining whether or not their Chinese colleagues and business partners are in fact practicing ''guanxi''. Caution and extra guidance should be taken to ensure that conflict does not occur as a result of misunderstood cultural agreements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other studies argue that ''guanxi'' is not in fact unethical, but is rather wrongly accused of an act thought unethical in the eyes of those unacquainted with it and Chinese culture. Just as how the Western juridical system is the image of the Western ethical attitudes, it can be said that the Eastern legal system functions similarly so. Also, while Westerners might misunderstand ''guanxi'' as a form of corruption, the Chinese recognize ''guanxi'' as a subset of ''renqing'', which likens the maintenance of interpersonal relationships to a moral obligation. As such, any relevant actions taken to maintain such relationships are recognized as working within ethical constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Lovett, Lee C. Simmons and Raja Kali. "Guanxi versus the Market: Ethics and Efficiency." ''Journal of International Business Studies'' 30.2 (1999): 231-247. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''guanxixue'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|关系学}}, the 'art' or 'knowledge' of ''guanxi'') is also used to specifically refer to the manipulation and corruption brought about by a selfish and sometimes illegal utilization of ''guanxi''. In turn, ''guanxixue'' distinguishes unethical usage of ''guanxi'' from the term ''guanxi'' itself.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Guthrie. 1998. ''The Declining Significance of Guanxi in China's Economic Transition''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many Chinese lament the strong importance of ''guanxi'' in their culture because of the unethical use that arises through it, they still consider ''guanxi'' as a Chinese element that should not be denied.

==Similar concepts in other cultures==
Sociologists have linked ''guanxi'' with the concept of [[social capital]] (it has been described as a ''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' value structure), and it has been exhaustively described in Western studies of Chinese economic and political behavior.&lt;ref name="Gold, Thomas 2002"/&gt;

===Western vs. Eastern social business relations===
The three dimensions for a successful business networking comprise: trust, bonding, mutual relationship, and empathy. Nevertheless, the points of view in which these dimensions are understood and consolidated into business tasks are extensively disparate in the East vs the West. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Meiling Wong. "''Guanxi'' and its role in business." ''Chinese Management Studies'' 1:4 (2007): 257 - 276. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Western point of view, trust is treated as shared unwavering quality, constancy, and correspondence. Instead, from the Eastern point of view, trust is additionally synonymous with obligation, where guanxi is required to be kept up through persistent long haul affiliation and connection. The Chinese system of ''wu-lune'' (the basic norms of ''guanxi'') supports the Eastern attitude, emphasizing that one’s fulfillment of one’s responsibilities in a given role ensures the smooth functioning of Chinese society. Correspondence is likewise a measurement which is substantially more stressed in the East than in the West . As per Confucianism, every individual is urged to wind up a yi-ren (exemplary individual) and compensate some help with altogether more than one has gotten. In conclusion, compassion is a measurement that is exceedingly implanted in Eastern business bonds, the significance for dealers and clients to see each other's needs is extremely important. The Confucian understanding of ''ren'', which also equates to “Do not do to others as one does not want others to do to him”, stresses the importance for sellers and customers to understand each other’s needs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Cross-cultural differences in its usage also distinguish Western relationship marketing from Chinese ''guanxi''. Unlike Western relationship marketing, where networking plays a more surface-level impersonal role in shaping larger business relations, ''guanxi'' plays a much more central and personal role in shaping social business relations. Chinese culture borrows much of its practices from Confucianism, which emphasises collectivism and long-term personal relations. Likewise, ''guanxi'' functions within Chinese culture and directly reflects the values and behaviours expressed in Chinese business relations.&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/877038279?pq-origsite=summon|title = The Importance of Guanxi to Multinational Companies in China|last = Yang|first = Fang|date = July 2011|journal = Asian Social Science|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, reciprocal obligation plays an intricate role in maintaining harmonious business relations. It is expected that both sides not only stay friendly with each other, but also reciprocate a favour given by the other party. Western relationship marketing, on the other hand, is much more formally constructed, in which no social obligation and further exchanges of favours are expected. Thus, long-term personal relations are more emphasised in Chinese ''guanxi'' practice than in Western relationship marketing.&lt;ref name="Yang"/&gt;

Asher dropped out of school at the age of 16 and worked as a [[technical drawing|draftsman]] in a local [[factory]]. Later he worked in a [[Trade union|union]] job painting [[radio]] towers, with a house painting business on the side. Asher moved to [[Florida]] to avoid the seasonal shutdown in painting, soon establishing a business painting [[condominium]]s on Florida's Gold Coast. By the age of 21, he had 100 painters working for him and was reportedly grossing US$10 million a year.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;

In 1982 Asher smuggled [[cocaine]] while living in the [[Bahamas]] over a seven-week stint, flying to [[Colombia]] and [[Belize]] in his plane. Later he joined [[F. Lee Bailey]] and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], convincing other Americans in Bahamas to exit the drug trade.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt; "He was never charged with a crime, but a cloud of negative publicity has hung over his head for years, even prompting his resignation from Seisint's board [in 2003]." &lt;ref name="Sun-Sentinel.com"&gt;*[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-07-16/business/0407151226_1_seisint-cancer-research-homeland-security Boca's Seisint Sold In $775 Million Deal], "Sun Sentinel" July 16, 2004, loaded December 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asher touted his new company, TLO which stands for “The Last One” as having 100 times the power of his previous inventions.  Development started in 2008, and in May 2011, TLOxp came out of preliminary development.  Usage reached over 80,000 Law Enforcement Investigators and over 17,000 commercial accounts.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"/&gt;

In 2013, the company Hank Asher founded, TLO, was in bankruptcy court with a claim of liabilities at $109 million.&lt;ref name="bizjournals.com"&gt;*[http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/blog/2013/05/tlo-bankruptcy-is-company-worth-20m.html], "South Florida Business journal" May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[TransUnion]] acquired TLO for $154 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TransUnion Closes Acquisition of TLO|url=http://www.insidearm.com/daily/collection-technologies/collection-technology/transunion-closes-acquisition-of-tlo-after-judge-approves/|website=Inside Arm|publisher=Inside Arm|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enters data fusion business ==
Unemployed, Asher began operating as a freelance [[computer]] [[computer programmer|programmer]]. In 1992, he started a business [[DBT Online Inc|Database Technologies]] that used clusters of PCs to provide [[parallel supercomputing]] in place of more expensive mainframes and mini computers. His first contract was a data mining application for the insurance industry performed on records bought from the Florida's Department of Motor Vehicles.

DBT Online bought Asher out for US$147 million in 1999 after the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration suspended their contracts following revelations with Asher's involvements in drug dealing in the Bahamas and concerns that the company could potentially monitor targets of investigations.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;

Asher blamed his ouster from Database Technologies on board member [[Kenneth Langone]] who joined the company at his invitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southflorida.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2005/03/21/story1.html Database pioneer ready for new adventure], ''South Florida Business Journal'', 21 March 2005, loaded 2 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

After departing DBT Online, Asher founded [[Seisint]] in 1999 by merging two companies.

ChoicePoint Public Records filed a lawsuit against Asher and Seisint in 2001 at [[Palm Beach County]] [[Circuit Court]], alleging Seisint stole technology, including source code and computer hardware. Asher counter-sued in 2001 in the [[Fort Lauderdale]] U.S. [[United States district court|District Court]] alleging unfair business practices by ChoicePoint Director [[Kenneth Langone]] and sought more than US$1.6 billion in damages. Both suits were dismissed on 8 March 2005 after ChoicePoint settled with Asher.

While at Seisint, Hank Asher played a leading role in developing the [[Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange]] (MATRIX) [[datamining]] system for the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]], described as a tool to help state law enforcement officials identify potential [[terrorist]]s. The MATRIX program was shut down in June 2005 after federal funding was cut in the wake of public concerns over privacy and state surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-205261 MATRIX data mining system is unplugged] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713221011/http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-205261 |date=2007-07-13 }}, ''Privacy International'', 5 June 2005, loaded 30 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Seisint was later sold to Anglo-Dutch publishing giant Reed Elsevier in July 2004, for US$775 million and combined with its own data aggregation subsidiary, [[LexisNexis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/929869/000115697305001249/u49186e6vk.htm], {{cite web|url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/content/detail.asp?ReleaseID%3D134074%26NewsAreaID%3D2%26NavigatedFromSearch%3DTrue |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930170829/http://www.gnn.gov.uk/content/detail.asp?ReleaseID=134074&amp;NewsAreaID=2&amp;NavigatedFromSearch=True |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Asher had retained a large stake in the company and said in an interview that he would earn more than $250 million from the sale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50577-2004Jul14.html LexisNexis to Buy Seisint for $775 Million], ''Washington Post'', 15 July 2004, loaded 2 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Asher made considerable donations to U.S. political parties and candidates amounting to US$735,000 from 1999 to 2004 including US$505,000 to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;

==Philanthropy==

===Work with Missing and Exploited Children===
Over the course of his career in the data business, Asher donated the services of his respective companies to an indeterminable number of law enforcement agencies and most notably the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]].  "No fewer than 109 children have been found as a direct result of Asher's help" according to [[Ernie Allen]], president of [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]].  Asher is the largest private donor in the history of the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]].&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;

His final venture, TLO, focuses directly on aiding these same groups in the mission of protecting children.  Asher supplied law enforcement in all 50 states and 39 countries a system that identifies pedophiles in cyberspace and is responsible for thousands of arrests and child rescues.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"/&gt;  He has attracted many prominent leaders to assist or support TLO:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palmbeachpost.com/localnews/content/local_news/epaper/2009/03/14/0314asher.html Boca database entrepreneur turns his attention from terrorists to pedophiles] ''Palm Beach Post'', 14 March 2009, loaded 26 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://southflorida.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2009/04/06/daily44.html Asher attracts ‘Most Wanted’ support] "South Florida Business Journal", 9 April 2009, loaded 26 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Reed Elsevier filed a suit in Palm Beach County Circuit Court which alleged Asher violated his non-compete agreement with the formation of TLO.  At the time, Reed Elsevier's attorney, Faith Gay stated, "He is out trying to sell a commercial product.  We're seeking damages for any harm that Asher has caused to our customer base...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2009/03/30/daily75.html Hank Asher sued by former company] "South Florida Business Journal", 3 April 2009, loaded 26 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Asher responded with a counter-suit seeking $1 billion in damages.  He said, "This lawsuit is completely without merit, and is a sad and disingenuous attempt to slow down the enormous progress we are making in our efforts to rescue children from sexual predators. I have given my systems to NCMEC for free since 1993. Every child that is rescued because of one of my systems is a paycheck for my soul. The allegation that someday I would charge for this work is insane."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/05-01-2009/0005017594&amp;EDATE 'Sham-ful' Behaviour: European Reed Elsevier Countersued for $1 Billion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322114810/http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F05-01-2009%2F0005017594&amp;EDATE |date=2012-03-22 }} "PRNewswire" 1 May 2009, loaded 26 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was dismissed 15 days prior to the expiration of the non-compete on September 1, 2009.  Asher commented "I find it kind of hysterical that they sued me before I competed and the case was dismissed before the non-compete ended."&lt;ref&gt;[http://southflorida.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2009/08/17/daily23.html LexisNexis suit against Asher dismissed] "South Florida Business Journal" 18 August 2009, loaded 20 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer Research===
Asher began his cancer research in 2001, when he put together a team of doctors and scientists.  He started by philanthropically funding and working with [[Mayo Clinic]] scientists on research projects he thought had promise.  Simultaneously he started clinical trials in [[Costa Rica]] to find a cure for his sister's newly diagnosed disease, [[Multiple Myeloma]].

In 2004, Asher formed JARI Research Foundation a philanthropic endeavor to support breakthrough cancer research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jari-research.org/management/hank_asher.html Jari Research] loaded 2 April 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008070814/http://www.jari-research.org/management/hank_asher.html |date=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation evolved into JARI Research Corporation a year later, in cooperation with the Mayo Clinic.  Clinical trials are conducted in the [[Dominican Republic]].

===Major Events===
Asher has a history of dedicating his personal efforts and the resources of his companies in times of crisis.  Two notable events are the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[Beltway sniper attacks]].

====Attacks on September 11, 2001====
In the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]], Asher worked with the [[FBI]], constructing a secure room inside the headquarters of his company at the time, [[Seisint]].  Asher and his team of programmers worked to identify associates of the terrorists, producing lists of individuals "worth investigating" later leading to "several arrests."  Asher said “You could accidentally live next door to Mohammed Atta.  You couldn’t accidentally live next door to Mohammed Atta twice.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/ontheweb/features/2004/12/matrix200412 The Net's Master Data-miner] "Vanity Fair"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Beltway sniper attacks====
At the height of the 2002 [[Beltway sniper attacks]] in the Washington, D.C., area, Asher worked with the [[FBI]] utilizing his [[data fusion]] invention, the [[Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange]] known as MATRIX to link investigation details to the real identity of [[John Allen Muhammad]].  
“They produced the list of all his relatives, associates, every place he ever lived,” Asher recounts. “The next morning they were in Tacoma, Washington, cutting the stump down that had the projectiles in it that matched the projectiles from the killings.” The next evening the snipers were apprehended.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;

'''Intaglio''' is the annual international Business school summit hosted by [[Indian Institute of Management Calcutta]]. The flagship event of IIM-C, it was started in 1989 as the National Business School Meet (NBSM).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ireference.ca/search/Indian%20Institute%20of%20Management%20Calcutta/&lt;/ref&gt; Intaglio, traditionally held over a 3-day weekend in January, serves as a platform facilitating the interaction of eminent personalities from the industry, academia, media and government, holding conferences, workshops and seminars by experts in different fields on a wide range of topics.

Intaglio in 2007 became the first event of its kind in India to achieve the ISO 9001:2000 certification from the International Organization for Standardization.&lt;ref name="official-website"&gt;http://www.iimc-intaglio.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Intaglio got the distinction of being the '''first carbon-neutral B-school event''' in India. This is being done through a number of environment-friendly measures such as using notepads and bags made of recycled paper and encouraging the use of social networking sites, emails and SMSes to publicise the event.&lt;ref&gt;http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/services/education/IIM-C-walks-the-extra-green-mile/articleshow/5414503.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting the Golden Jubilee of IIM Calcutta, the theme of Intaglio 2011 was "''Perspectives at 50... Genesis of a new tomorrow''".

==History==
The original version of Intaglio – The National Business School Meet – was started by the 25th Batch of IIM Calcutta in the year 1989. The meet consisted of a myriad of competitions viz. Strategy building competitions, presentation competition "''Shastrarth''" and the like.

The meet was rechristened "Intaglio" in the January 2002 edition.

Intaglio 2008-09 was held on the IIM Calcutta campus from 8 – 11 January 2009, this edition saw over 15,000 participants from more than 60 countries, and participation from 190 companies,  The total prize money for winners across events amounted to INR 10 Lakhs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiaprwire.com/pressrelease/education/2008092213378.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year, Intaglio organizes "Reverberations", a series of lectures by management and business leaders.

==Showcase Events==

=== Olympus ===
Olympus is the flagship event of Intaglio. It aims at identifying the most promising future leader amongst the students of the 6 IIMs (Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, Indore, Kozhikode, Lucknow) and select international B-schools.

In 2009, the event was won by Ms. Joo Yi from CEIBS, China.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceibs.edu/media/archive/36032.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Repeating the institute's success, the following 2010 edition of the event was won by Mr. John Timms from CEIBS, China.

===Wizards of Biz===
This boardroom challenge aims at testing the all round business acumen of the participants. This game requires the participants to allocate resources, battle uncertainty and tackle competition by making the most of the limited resources available. This is the first competition in the country to have in-house real time business simulation software. Prelims give the candidates a feel of running a full-scale business in a completely dynamic environment.
Those who manage to clear the preliminary rounds are further put to test in the on-campus finals involving multiple rounds of business challenges where decision making and strategic thinking are prerequisites to survive. The final round is designed to match a high pressure boardroom battle where the participants don the hats of the top level management of a firm for the coveted title.

===Chanakya===
This event gives participants the opportunity to develop a wide range of policies and test them against the wits of equally capable competition and an esteemed panel.

===Great Innovation Challenge===
The Great Innovation Challenge tests the participants on creativity and innovation, qualities that differentiate an outstanding manager from a good one.
The event gives participants the opportunity to work on live problems faced by Intaglio’s knowledge partners in a real life environment. An onsite field visit, interaction with company executives and thorough mentoring by the festival’s consulting partners helps participants get to the crux of the problem at hand and devise innovative solutions.

===Consulting Knights===
Intaglio’s Showcase event, Consulting Knights, challenges the participants with a comprehensive case developed with the fest’s corporate partners that tests their ability to understand the heart of the problem and search for answers. Traditionally, one of the most prestigious events at Intaglio, Consulting knights has seen participation from all over the world including the likes of NUS, Wharton etc.

==Social Initiatives==
Intaglio undertakes several social initiatives. In Intaglio 2008-09 started by holding team-building, creativity and public speaking workshops in Kendriya Vidyalaya School; this was a year-long initiative taken by the Intaglio team.

With 2009 being the year of general elections, Intaglio partnered ‘Jaago Re’ in spreading awareness about the elections to the youth of India. Furthermore, live events like inviting NGOs working with local artisans/children to exhibit their handiworks and screening daily social documentaries, were conducted.

For the online audiences, the stories and challenges Intaglio's partner NGOs faced were showcased. In the 2010-11 edition, these partnerships will be developed further to make them a permanent feature of Intaglio. Intaglio 2010-11 will feature events in collaboration with [http://iimc-intaglio.com/intaglio-cares/antyodaya/ Antyodaya] and [http://iimc-intaglio.com/intaglio-cares/sunehra-kal/ Sunehra Kal], for which Intaglio has set up a corpus of INR 400,000 to support education and women empowerment.

==Student Leadership Programme==
With participation from more than 160 national &amp; international business schools and over 175 corporates, SLP would provide students a platform to interact with some of the brightest minds from across a range of domains. SLP includes talks and panel discussions by eminent personalities like D Shivkumar, the head of Nokia India, S.K. Roongta, the Chairman of SAIL and the CEO of KKR, Joy Bhattacharya. In addition, students are also able to compete with participants from top Indian and international B-schools in On-campus events.

''Auckland Star'', Volume XLVII, Issue 268, 9 November 1916, Page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public life==
James Gunson stood for Parliament several times without success; ([[Roskill (New Zealand electorate)|Roskill]] in 1919, [[Eden (New Zealand electorate)|Eden]] in 1926 and then [[Auckland Suburbs (New Zealand electorate)|Auckland Suburbs]] in 1928).

==Auckland==
Mayor from 1915 to 1925 he undertook the building of the war memorials [[Auckland Museum]] and Cenotaph, the [[Domain Wintergardens|Wintergardens]] in [[Auckland Domain]] and the construction of [[Tamaki Drive]]. In later public life, he was responsible for the monument on One Tree Hill ([[Maungakiekie]]) and the treeplanting of [[Cornwall Park, Auckland|Cornwall Park]] fulfilling Sir [[John Logan Campbell (politician)|John Logan Campbell]]'s vision. Gunson was Chairman of the [[Auckland Harbour Board]] 1911–15, and was a member of the Government Railways Board 1931–35.

Several parts of the city bear his name or were his gift. His farming property to the South of Auckland in [[Manukau]], called Totara Park, was later given to the city of Auckland. His main town residence, in St Andrew's Road, [[Epsom, New Zealand|Epsom]], became the Tongan royal residence, which it remains.  A further Auckland property (named Rydal Mount after the residence of the English poet [[William Wordsworth]]) was by the same architect, Draffin, that Gunson had chosen to design [[Auckland Museum]]. Gunson Street, in Freemans Bay, Auckland, is named after him.

In 1935, he was awarded the [[King George V Silver Jubilee Medal]].&lt;ref name="EP"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19350506.2.12  | title=Official jubilee medals | date=6 May 1935 | work= Evening Post | accessdate=14 August 2013 | page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel-Louis Louis Crommelin''' (1652–1727) was a French [[Huguenot]] exile, who became director of an Irish [[linen]] business.

==Life==
Crommelin was born in May 1652 at [[Armandcourt]], near [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]] in [[Picardy]], into a family of landowners with a tradition of growing [[flax]]; his father, Louis Crommelin, married in 1648 to Marie Mettayer, was wealthy and had four sons, Samuel-Louis, Samuel, William, and Alexander. Samuel-Louis Crommelin, called Louis, was in business flax-spinning and linen-weaving. The family was [[Protestant]], and the [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] in 1685 hit hard even though Louis was a Catholic convert of 1683. With his son and two daughters he made his way to [[Amsterdam]]. There he became partner in a bank, and was joined by his brothers Samuel and William.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Crommelin, Samuel-Louis|volume=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], [[Thomas Southwell, 1st Baron Southwell|Thomas Southwell]] had access to funds to develop Irish industry.&lt;ref name="Southwell"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=26068|first=Kilbutn|last=Matthew|title=Southwell, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huguenot linen-workers had been encouraged to settle at [[Lisburn]]  where already there was some manufacture of linen. In 1696 the English parliament passed an act admitting all products of [[hemp]] and flax duty free from Ireland to England; the Irish parliament in November 1697 passed an act for fostering the linen manufacture. William III's policy was to discourage the Irish woollen trade, but to build up linen manufacture there.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; Crommelin was the most prominent Huguenot attracted by Southwell.&lt;ref name="Southwell"/&gt; He arrived at Lisburn in the autumn of 1698, and made recommendations for improving the linen industry in a memorial of 16 April 1699; which were implemented quickly. Crommelin was made "overseer of the royal linen manufacture of Ireland", and lent money for the scheme. In 1702 [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] confirmed its royal patent.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Crommelin began by ordering looms from Flanders and Holland, and Huguenot weavers were introduced. He adopted Irish [[spinning-wheel]] but worked to improve it. His maker of the reeds, which control the [[warp thread]]s, was Henry Mark du Pré (d. 1750), of [[Cambrai]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craigavonhistoricalsociety.org.uk/rev/luttonlinentrade.html|title=''The Linen Trade in Co. Armagh'', craigavonhistoricalsociety.org.uk|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Baron Conway|Baron Conway]] gave a site for weaving workshops, and Irish apprentices were taken on. Dutchmen were engaged to teach flax-growing to farmers, and to superintend bleaching operations. It is not without some reason that Crommelin has been credited with originating, as regards Ulster, a system of technical education for the textile art. Crommelin was assisted by his brothers, and the linens and [[cambric]]s could replace imported textiles. In 1705 a factory was opened at [[Kilkenny]], under the management of William Crommelin.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Crommelin expanded operations, with the manufacture of hempen [[sailcloth]] at [[Rathkeale]] and other locations. He was given a pension in 1716, and died at Lisburn on 14 July 1727, aged 75. He was buried, with other Huguenots, in the eastern corner of the graveyard of [[Lisburn Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Family==
[[File:CrommelinGraveLisburnCathedral.JPG|thumb|Crommelin grave, Lisburn Cathedral]]
The wife of Louis Crommelin was named Ann. She survived her husband by twenty-eight years, dying August 17, 1755, at the age of 97.

'''Nodosa Shipyard''' is a [[Shipyard]] dedicated to the construction, modification and repair of all kinds of metal hull [[Watercraft|vessel]]s of up to 150 meters [[length]], as well as general industrial manufacturing.

Located in the northwest of [[Spain]], particularly in the region of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], the [[Shipyard]] currently has three operational centers working in the province of [[Pontevedra]], the factory in the parish of [[Bueu]], the yard and the repair center in the [[Marín (Pontevedra)|Marin]] Port Authority sited in the [[Marín (Pontevedra)|homonymous parish]] and the workshop located in the city of [[Pontevedra]], provincial capital.

== History ==

[[File:BA 2 OMVAC DIEZ 02.jpg|thumb|left|Split hopper dredger "Omvac Diez"]]

Nodosa Shipyard was born over 40 years ago as an auxiliary company for metal industry. In 1982 inaugurates its metalworking shops and in the early 90s acquires the concession of a small dock. After successive stages of growth and expansion, the first one becomes the current factory and the head office, and the second one in the today's shipyard. Other workshops have been added in parallel, as the mechanical workshop ([[Nodosafer]]).

On January 19, 2015, the company formalized the acquisition of Factoria Naval de Marin shipyard (FNM),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.farodevigo.es/portada-o-morrazo/2015/02/03/nodosa-propietaria-legal-factoria-naval/1177207.html |title=Nodosa is already legal owner of Factory Naval after signing purchase deed |publisher= www.farodevigo.es | accessdate= 3 February 2015 | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantico.net/articulo/economia/nodosa-queda-factoria-naval-marin-y-plantilla/20141126100610448156.html |title=nodosa acquires FNM and its workers |publisher= www.atlantico.net |accessdate=26 November 2014 |language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes both facilities and the granting of land use, and also the property over the historical shipbuilder and its brand ''Marin Luxury Yachts'' names.

It was precisely the construction of all kind of fishing vessels which gave rise to the company, thanks to a geographical linkage to a seafaring region as the [[Rías Baixas]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], where fishing represents one of the most important economic activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Nottingham city centre''' is the cultural, commercial, financial and historical heart of [[Nottingham]], England. Nottingham's city centre represents the central area of the [[Greater Nottingham]] [[conurbation]].

The centre of the city is usually defined as the [[Old Market Square]] – the UK's largest city square. A major redevelopment of the Old Market Square was completed in March 2007. Many of the main shopping streets abut the square, which is dominated by Nottingham's [[Nottingham Council House|city hall]]. The building's landmark dome may be seen for miles around. Much of the ground floor of the building houses the [[Exchange Arcade#Exchange Arcade|Exchange Arcade]], a [[boutique]] shopping centre.

A [[Bohemian style|Bohemian]] quarter of the city known as [[Hockley Village|Hockley]] has arisen in recent years, situated close to the [[Lace Market]] area.

The north-western end of the city centre is home to the [[Nottingham Trent University]] city campus which contains a lively mix of old and new buildings. The [[Nottingham Trent University|University's]] Newton building is one of the tallest buildings in Nottingham and has a prominent position on the city's skyline.

Nottingham's [[Nottingham railway station|central railway station]] is located in the city centre. [[Nottingham Express Transit]] trams also service the area.

==Shopping==
Nottingham city centre has been voted 5th in [[Experian]]'s list of the top 15 UK retail areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://strategies.experian.co.uk/News/~/media/Files/News/Retail%20risk%20rankings%20%20%20tables.ashx Shopping Rankings]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city centre's fashion core is centred on [[Bridlesmith Gate]], which is home to upmarket names such as [[Kurt Geiger]], [[Ted Baker]] and [[Diesel S.p.A.|Diesel]]. [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Sir Paul Smith's]] flagship store is located on Middle Pavement, and [[Hugo Boss]] is located on St. Peter's Gate. London-based [[Harvey Nichols]] now have plans to open a store in the Broadmarsh area but it depends on the development that is due to take place over the year.

==Zones==
{{Main article|Nottingham Parksmart}}

Nottingham city centre is split into five "zones" which were introduced with the [[Nottingham Parksmart]] scheme in 2009 to signpost visitors to parking facilities and tourist attractions. The zones are:

*[[Nottingham Parksmart#Zones|Lace Market]]
*[[Nottingham Parksmart#Zones|Broadmarsh]]
*[[Nottingham Parksmart#Zones|Castle]]
*[[Nottingham Parksmart#Zones|Royal]]
*[[Nottingham Parksmart#Zones|Victoria]]

==Visitor attractions==
[[Nottingham Castle]] is a popular attraction for visitors to the city due to its links with [[Robin Hood]]. The Brewhouse Yard Museum (Museum of Nottingham Life) and the Museum of Costume and Textiles are close by.

Part of Nottingham's expansive cave network is open to the public through the [[City of Caves]] attraction, and the [[Galleries of Justice]] on [[High Pavement]] were once a fully functioning Victorian [[courtroom]].

Notable churches within the city centre include the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Nottingham Cathedral]], and the medieval [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham|St. Mary's Church]] at the heart of the Lace Market.

The [[National Ice Centre]] (adjoined to Capital FM Arena Nottingham) is located close to the city's Lace Market quarter and is the first twin Olympic ice-pad facility in the UK. It is the home of the [[Nottingham Panthers]], a professional [[ice-hockey]] team.

[[Rock City (club)|Rock City]] is a mid-sized music venue that draws many popular bands from across the world, and so is an important part of Nottingham's [[music tourism]] scene.

==Entertainment==
Nottingham is home to a wide variety of entertainment venues, the largest of which is the 10,000-seater [[Capital FM Arena]] (part of the National Ice Centre), where many big-name acts perform regularly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nottingham-arena.com Trent FM Arena]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's major producing theatre, the [[Nottingham Playhouse]], has built up a national reputation for its exciting, innovative and contemporary new works.

The Nottingham Royal Centre incorporates the 2,500-seater [[Nottingham Royal Concert Hall|Royal Concert Hall]] and the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[Theatre Royal, Nottingham|Theatre Royal]]. The Royal Concert Hall is the region's top venue for classical music and regularly plays host to world-class orchestras and ballets, while the Theatre Royal is considered one of the finest venues in the country for major touring [[West End theatre|West End]] musicals and plays.

The city is also the forerunner of Improvisational Comedy in the midlands, MissImp (Mission Improbable) is a growing force in the comedy scene in Nottingham. A student group also runs at the University of Nottingham. And the famous [[Glee Club]] situated along the Nottingham Canal&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glee.co.uk/nottingham&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Corner House, Nottingham|The Corner House]] entertainment complex houses a multi-screen [[Cineworld|Cineworld cinema]] and a multitude of continental pavement-cafes and restaurants, a casino, a simulation pilot spot and an indoor crazy golf with 18 holes.

==Eastside City==
Eastside City is the name of the redevelopment project that is set to transform an extensive former industrial [[brownfield]] area to the east of Nottingham city centre's historic core. This area stretches from the [[Nottingham Canal|Nottingham-Beeston Canal]] in the south towards the [[National Ice Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastside-city.com/vision.asp?pnav=2&amp;slide=2 Eastside &amp; City Developments Background]&lt;/ref&gt; At the heart of the [[Urban renewal|regeneration]] zone will be The Island site which will be totally overhauled to become a thriving city quarter with public open spaces, restaurants and bars and a new park for the city's inhabitants. The development will consist of new homes, offices and retail units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastside-city.com/vision.asp?pnav=2&amp;slide=5 Eastside &amp; City Developments Background]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:London (1932) Ending the depression through planned obsolescence.pdf|thumb|''Ending the [[Depression (economics)|Depression]] Through Planned Obsolescence'' by Bernard London, 1932]]

'''Obsolescence''' is the state of being which occurs when an object, service, or practice is no longer wanted even though it may still be in good working order; however, the international standard EN62402 Obsolescence Management - Application Guide defines '''Obsolescence''' as being the "transition from availability of products by the original manufacturer or supplier to unavailability". Obsolescence frequently occurs because a replacement has become available that has, in sum, more advantages compared to the disadvantages incurred by maintaining or repairing the original. '''Obsolete''' also refers to something that is already disused or discarded, or antiquated.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler HW and Fowler FG (1st ed.), Thompson Delia (ed.) (1995). The Hardy Boyz use the term "obsolete mule" at times. ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English'', 9th Ed., Clarendon Press, Oxford. {{ISBN|0-19-861319-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, obsolescence is preceded by a gradual decline in popularity.

==Consequences==
Driven by rapid [[technological change]]s, new components are developed and launched on the market with increasing speed. The result is a dramatic change in production methods of all components and their market availability. A growing industry sector is facing issues where life cycles of products no longer fit together with life cycles of required components. This issue is known as obsolescence, the status given to a part when it is no longer available from its original manufacturer. The problem of obsolescence is most prevalent for electronics technology, wherein the procurement lifetimes for microelectronic parts are often significantly shorter than the manufacturing and support life cycles for the products that use the parts. However, obsolescence extends beyond electronic components to other items, such as materials, textiles, and mechanical parts. In addition, obsolescence has been shown to appear for software, specifications, standards, processes, and soft resources, such as human skills. It is highly important to implement and operate an active management of obsolescence to mitigate and avoid extreme costs.&lt;ref&gt;Bjoern Bartels, Ulrich Ermel, Peter Sandborn and Michael G. Pecht (2012). ''Strategies to the Prediction, Mitigation and Management of Product Obsolescence'', 1st. Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey. {{ISBN|1-11-814064-8}} .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Technical obsolescence===
Technical obsolescence usually occurs when a new product or technology supersedes the old one, and it is preferred to use the new technology instead. Historical examples of new technologies superseding old ones include [[bronze]] replacing [[flint]] in hand-tools, [[DVD]]s replacing [[videocassette recorder|videocassettes]], and the [[telephone]] replacing the [[telegraph]]. On a smaller scale, a particular product may become obsolete when a newer version replaces it. Many products in the computer industry become obsolete in this manner. For example, [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs) frequently become obsolete in favor of newer, faster units. Singularly, rapid obsolescence of [[data]] formats along with their supporting hardware and software can lead to loss of critical information, a process known as [[digital obsolescence]].

In many cases, a new technology does not totally replace the old technology because the old technology is still useful in certain applications. For example, [[transistor]]s replaced [[vacuum tube]]s in TV and radio receivers in the 1960s, but vacuum tubes were still used for powerful transmitters because transistors for these power levels were not available. Even today, one has to use multiple transistors for a purpose that used to require just one tube.

Products may also become obsolete when supporting technologies are no longer available to produce or even repair a product. For example, many [[integrated circuit]]s, including CPUs, memory and even some relatively simple logic chips may no longer be produced because the technology has been superseded, their original developer has gone out of business or a competitor has bought them out and effectively killed off their products to remove competition. It is rarely worth redeveloping a product to get around these issues since its overall functionality and price/performance ratio has usually been superseded by that time as well.

Some products become technologically obsolete due to changes in complementary products which results in the function of the first product being made unnecessary. For example, [[buggy whip]]s became obsolete when people started to travel in cars rather than in horse-drawn buggies.

=== Functional obsolescence ===
Items become functionally obsolete when they can no longer adequately perform the function for which they were created. For example, while one could theoretically adapt an [[Avro Lancaster]] to deploy modern [[JDAM]] bombs, the situations in which it could actually succeed at doing so against modern air defenses would be so few that it would be essentially useless.

Manufacturers and repair companies will typically cease support for products once they become obsolete as keeping production lines in place and parts in storage for a shrinking user base becomes unprofitable. This causes scarcity of spare parts and skilled technicians for repairs and thus escalates maintenance costs for obsolete products. This ultimately leads to prohibitive expense in keeping old technology functioning.

=== Architectural obsolescence ===
The term "obsolescence" was first applied to the built environment in 1910 in an attempt to explain American skyscrapers' sudden loss of value.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Daniel|year=2012|title=From Obsolescence to Sustainability, Back Again, and Beyond|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=279-298|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York engineer Reginald P. Bolton attributed this phenomenon to "something new and better out-competing the old" and calculated the average architectural lifespan of varying building types in order to formulate a rough estimate for their impending obsolescence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, he suggested that hotel's obsolescence will occur faster than banks due to their ever-changing functions and tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building for Profit: Principles Governing the Economic Improvement of Real Estate|last=Bolton|first=R.P.|publisher=De Vinne|year=1911|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planned obsolescence===
{{Main article|Planned obsolescence}}
Sometimes [[marketing|marketer]]s deliberately introduce obsolescence into their [[product management|product strategy]], with the objective of generating long-term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases. One example might be producing an appliance which is deliberately designed to wear out within five years of its purchase, pushing consumers to replace it within five years.

===Style obsolescence===
[[File:Jimi Hendrix's bell-bottoms, Hard Rock Cafe Hollywood.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Jimi Hendrix]]'s bell-bottoms]]

When a product is no longer desirable because it has gone out of the popular fashion, its style is obsolete. One example is [[Bell-bottoms|flared leg jeans]]; although this article of clothing may still be perfectly functional, it is no longer desirable because style trends have moved away from the flared leg cut.

Because of the "fashion cycle", stylistically obsolete products may eventually regain popularity and cease to be obsolete. A current example is "[[Stone washing|acid-wash]]" jeans, which were popular in the 1980s, became stylistically obsolete in the mid to late 1990s, and returned to popularity in the 2000s.

===Obsolescence management===
{{Main article|DMSMS}}

Obsolescence management, also referred to as "Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages" (DMSMS), is defined as to the activities that are undertaken to mitigate the effects of obsolescence. Activities can include last-time buys, lifetime buys, and obsolescence monitoring.

[[File:Pareto analysis.svg|A Pareto analysis in a diagram showing which cause should be addressed first.|right|thumb|400px]]
'''Pareto analysis''' is a formal technique useful where many possible courses of action are competing for attention. In essence, the problem-solver estimates the benefit delivered by each action, then  selects a number of the most effective actions that deliver a total benefit reasonably close to the maximal possible one.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Pareto analysis is a creative way of looking at causes of problems because it helps stimulate thinking and organize thoughts. However, it can be limited by its exclusion of possibly important problems which may be small initially, but which grow with time. It should be combined with other analytical tools such as [[failure mode and effects analysis]] and [[fault tree analysis]] for example.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

This technique helps to identify the top portion of causes that need to be addressed to resolve the majority of problems. Once the predominant causes are identified, then tools like the [[Ishikawa diagram]] or Fish-bone Analysis can be used to identify the root causes of the problems. While it is common to refer to pareto as "80/20" rule, under the assumption that, in all situations, 20% of causes determine 80% of problems, this ratio is merely a convenient rule of thumb and is not nor should it be considered an immutable law of nature.

The application of the Pareto analysis in risk management allows management to focus on those risks that have the most impact on the project.&lt;ref&gt;David Litten, [http://www.pmhut.com/project-risk-and-risk-management Project Risk and Risk Management], ''Retrieved May 16, 2010''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steps to identify the important causes using 80/20 rule==
{{main|80/20 rule}}
# Form a frequency of occurrences as a percentage
# Arrange the rows in decreasing order of importance of the causes (i.e., the most important cause first)
# Add a cumulative percentage column to the table, then plot the information
# Plot (#1) a curve with causes on ''x''- and cumulative percentage on ''y''-axis
# Plot (#2) a bar graph with causes on ''x''- and percent frequency on ''y''-axis
# Draw a horizontal dotted line at 80% from the ''y''-axis to intersect the curve. Then draw a vertical dotted line from the point of intersection to the ''x''-axis. The vertical dotted line separates the important causes (on the left) and trivial causes (on the right)
# Explicitly review the chart to ensure that causes for at least 80% of the problems are captured

The potential for shareholder oppression arguably increased when [[corporate law]] was changed to eliminate the [[common law]] right of minority shareholders to veto fundamental corporate changes such as [[merger]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=1989|publisher=Duke L.J.|pages=258|year=1989|title=Rejecting the Minority Discount|author=Heglar, Robert B.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/duklr1989&amp;section=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that the [[business judgment rule]] and notions of [[majority rule]] have allowed shareholder majorities to use the minority's investment without paying for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=60|publisher=Miss.

'''''Ski Resort Extreme''''' is a computer simulation game which puts the player in charge of creating and running a ski resort. It was developed and released in 2004 by [[Cat Daddy Games]] who also developed the very similar ''[[Ski Resort Tycoon]]'' and ''[[Ski Resort Tycoon II]]''.

''Ski Resort Extreme'' puts the player in the shoes of a ski resort developer whose aim is to attract varied groups of skiers and snowboarders by catering to their needs and expectations, be it ski runs, equipment, entertainment or amenities.

Resorts may be started from scratch, with more or less money depending on the difficulty level. Alternatively, players may take challenges where the task is to fix the problems of an existing resort in a specified period of time.

The game also allows the player to create a terrain with the map editor, with the option to import one's own height map.

'''''Squawk Box''''' is a business news [[television program]] that airs at breakfast time on the [[CNBC]] network. The program is currently co-hosted by [[Joe Kernen]], [[Rebecca Quick|Becky Quick]], and [[Andrew Ross Sorkin]]. Since debuting in 1995, the show has spawned a number of versions across CNBC's international channels, many of which employ a similar format. The program title originates from a term used in [[Investment banking|investment banks]] and stock [[broker]]ages for a [[Squawk box|permanent voice circuit]] or [[intercom]] used to communicate stock deals or sales priorities; it also may refer to the squawk of a bird, like a [[peacock]], which is the logo of CNBC.

|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''
|accessdate=November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Squawk Box'' features early-morning analysis of and [[breaking news]] from the [[financial market]]s, along with considerable banter between the hosts and their guests – original host [[Mark Haines]] stressed the need to "inject a little fun" into business news in the early morning.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Another distinctive and long-running feature of the show has been its use of daily "guest hosts" – figures from the world of business and [[politics]] who join the team for much of the broadcast, questioning guests as well as offering their own opinions.

Regular contributors to the show include [[Sharon Epperson]] ([[NYMEX]]), [[Rick Santelli]] (Chicago), [[Steve Liesman]], [[Guy Adami]] and CNBC senior analyst [[Ron Insana]].

Meteorologists from [[The Weather Channel]] contribute to the "Business Travel Forecast" segments.

==History==
''Squawk Box''’s core on-air team remained intact for many years – the program was originally presented by [[New Jersey]] lawyer Mark Haines, along with in-studio reporters Joe Kernen, [[David Faber (CNBC)|David Faber]] and [[Maria Bartiromo]] at the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. CNBC's senior economics reporter Steve Liesman also became a frequent contributor. [[Alexis Glick]] joined the team as senior trading correspondent in May 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|publisher=''[[Forbes]]''
|accessdate=November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rebecca Quick]] later replaced Glick as a reporter.

For many years the program covered the opening bells of the New York Stock Exchange and [[NASDAQ|NASDAQ Stock Market]] at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Other regular segments included the ''Squawk Exchange'', where the team (particularly Faber and Kernen) shared banter on various topics, ''On the Box'' (rapid-fire summaries of the day's headlines) and ''Joe's World'', where Kernen sounded off on the day's notable [[stock]] stories.

During the period when CNBC's online presence was housed at [[MSN|MSN Money]], the show held its own daily ''Squawk Back Poll'' on the website, where viewers voted on a topical issue. In May 2005 the program established its own [[blog]] on [[Windows Live Spaces]], called ''SquawkBlog'', where the program hosts posted their thoughts, although this is no longer in use.

===2005 revamp===
The program underwent a significant revamp on December 19, 2005, with the show moving to the 6:00 am ET timeslot and Kernen, Quick and [[Carl Quintanilla]] helming a new tri-anchor format alongside on-air editor [[Charles Gasparino]]. Haines and Faber moved to a newly created program, ''[[Squawk on the Street]]'', anchored from the NYSE by Haines and [[Erin Burnett]] with Faber at CNBC headquarters. As a result of these changes, coverage of the market open at 9:30am ET passed to ''Squawk on the Street''. The "guest host" feature of ''Squawk Box'' was dropped immediately after the revamp but later reinstated.

There was a significant amount of initial negative feedback about the changes made to ''Squawk'', most notably the removal of Mark Haines from the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===2011–present===
On July 8, 2011, Quintanilla left ''Squawk Box'' to become part of the new ''Squawk on the Street'' anchor team, following Haines' death on May 24 of that year. His new assignment began three days later, when he debuted with [[Melissa Lee (journalist)|Melissa Lee]] and Simon Hobbs.  [[Andrew Ross Sorkin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', joined Kernen and Quick in order to succeed Quintanilla's anchoring duties.  Sorkin made his debut as co-anchor July 18, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2011/07/nyts-andrew-ross-sorkin-joins-cnbcs-squawk-box-147415/|title=NYT's Sorkin Joins CNBC's 'Squawk Box'|work=Deadline|author=Lieberman, David|date=July 15, 2011|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 2014, ''Squawk Box'', along with CNBC's other trading-day shows, were launched in full 1080i high-definition as part of a network-wide switch to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation on that same day.

On January 7, 2015, ''Squawk Box'' moved to a new street-side studio inside the [[Time-Life Building]] in [[New York City]] after almost two decades in New Jersey (at CNBC's original facilities in Fort Lee from its August 7, 1995, debut to October 10, 2003, and at CNBC's facilities in Englewood Cliffs from October 13, 2003, to January 6, 2015).

On January 4, 2016, ''Squawk Box'' debuted a remastered version of its logo used since October 13, 2014.  On February 8, 2016, both the Asian and European versions also started using the remastered ''Squawk Box'' logo.

On November 14, 2016, it was officially announced by the [[NASDAQ]] that production of ''Squawk Box'' would be relocated to the [[NASDAQ MarketSite]] studio in Times Square; it began broadcasting from there on January 3, 2017. That same studio is also shared with CNBC's two other shows, ''[[Fast Money (CNBC)|Fast Money]]'' and ''Options Action'' (the latter airing on Fridays only; both shows are hosted by [[Melissa Lee]]).

On November 15, 2017, ''Squawk Box'' moved downstairs to a new street-level studio overlooking Times Square, also at the NASDAQ MarketSite.

==Show times==
The program airs from 6 a.m. until 9 a.m. [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] in the United States.

It is relayed in its entirety live on [[CNBC Europe]] although it is sometimes partially pre-empted for local programming, particularly to cover [[European Central Bank]] interest rate announcements and the subsequent [[news conference|press conferences]].

In Asia, the show is aired in its entirety on [[CNBC Asia]] from Mondays to Fridays (vary between time to time during U.S. Daylight Saving Time and Standard Time). Also, it can be air in New Zealand from Tuesdays to Saturdays during [[Time in New Zealand|Daylight Saving Time]] when U.S. is on Eastern Standard Time.

==Spin-offs==
===''Squawk Box Weekend Edition''===
CNBC once aired '''''Squawk Box Weekend Edition''''' weekends from 7:30 to 8 pm ET during c. 1999 to 2000, also hosted by Mark Haines.

===Worldwide ''Squawk Box''===
Around CNBC's global branches, there are many "Squawk Boxes" in the world:

Among the above, '''''Squawk Box Europe''''' and '''''Asia Squawk Box''''' are the counterparts which resemble the original '''''Squawk Box''''' the most:

*They are all three hours in duration.
*They all have a guest host appearing on the show, mostly after the first hour.
*In addition, Maria Bartiromo has served as a guest co-anchor on both ''Squawk Box Europe'' and ''Asia Squawk Box''.

(Karen Tso moved to the Asian version of ''Squawk Box'' (and was based in Singapore) and after [[Amanda Drury]] briefly replaced Tso on ''Squawk Australia'', Oriel Morrison moved into that role in 2010 while Drury is now based in CNBC World Headquarters in the U.S.). Tso moved to the European version of ''Squawk Box'' after joining CNBC Europe in 2011.

==''Fantasy Portfolio Challenge''==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[CNBC]] --&gt;
150,221 players participated in the ''Squawk Box Fantasy Portfolio Challenge'', a stock-picking contest that ran from April 4, 2006 through May 26, 2006. The winner of the ''Squawk Box Fantasy Portfolio Challenge'', which was announced live at the end of the 2 June 2006 episode, was Thomas Ko of [[California]]. His $5,015,735 [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] value outpaced all the other contenders. He was also the winner of a brand-new, limited-production, 2006 [[Maserati GranSport]].

'''''Windfall: The Oil Crisis Game''''' is a real-time [[business simulation game]] developed by [[David Mullich]] in [[1980 in video gaming|1980]] for the [[Apple II]].  Based upon [[queuing theory]] and released after the [[1979 energy crisis]], the game puts the player in the role of chief executive of Engulf Oil, setting gas prices and worker salaries, monitoring gas station lines, scheduling oil tanker arrivals, and negotiating oil prices with OPEC countries in a race against the clock to maximize profits.  As with most Edu-Ware games, ''Windfall'' has an educational aspect, demonstrating the delicate balance in complex systems.

==Gameplay==

The player has six primary choices in this simulation of oil company operations:

# Observe Service Stations: A low-resolution graphics display appears, showing six service stations, two of which are under the player's control, while the other four are operated by computer-controlled competitors.  Small colored blocks entering the queue at each station represent thousands of cars. The queue length at each station is an indicator of the gasoline demand at the current selling price and the time it takes for each station to service cars.
# Observe Dock Yards: Another low-resolution graphics display appears, depicting oil tankers arriving at the docks.  The queue length at each dock is an indicator of the oil supply at the current purchase price and the time it takes for each dock to service each tanker.
# Service Station Statistics: A table of text information allows players to see such things as the amount of gasoline each station has to sell, how long the waiting queue of cars is, how much the rival stations may be undercutting the player's prices.
# Dock Yard Statistics: This text table shows players how much they are paying oil producers, how efficient the oil flow from their suppliers is, how much they are paying their dock workers.  Sometimes bad weather may slow down the arrival of ships.
# Set Wages, Prices, and Purchases: Here players can change the price of gasoline, wages of their station attendants, and select their oil source from among several fictional OPEC countries.
# Financial Status: This screen allows players to see the financial health of their company, buy or sell stock, and make an attempt at [[price fixing]].

Strategy is based upon several simple economic principles.  If players pay their employees poorly, the service time will be longer; however, if players pay them too much, prices will need to be raised to maintain a profit, but competitors may steal business away with lower prices.  If gasoline prices go too high, the government may step in and set price limits.  Occasionally, stockholders will overrule players' decisions.

A clock runs continuously through the game.  When time expires, the player's performance is evaluated.

==Reception==

''Windfall'', like most games from Edu-Ware's zip-lock bag era, sold only a few hundred units.{{cn|date=October 2017}} However, it was well reviewed, receiving an "A" rating from ''Peelings II'' magazine, which concluded, "Behind the simple displays is (probably) a reasonably sophisticated realtime simulation program synthesized with a realtime display updated.  Considering the programming effort involved and the educational value of the program, it is a bargain.  And it is great fun to play."{{cn|date=October 2017}}

Bruce Webster reviewed ''Windfall'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 31.&lt;ref name="SG"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webster|first=Bruce |date=September 1980 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=31|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webster commented that "If there is a problem with this game, it is that the topic may not be all that interesting to you, or that the treatment may be too simple for your tastes. Beyond that, I can think of no serious objections to the game."&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt;
