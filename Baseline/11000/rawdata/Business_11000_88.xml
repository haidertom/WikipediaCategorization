{{arabic name|Al Thani}}
[[Sheikh]] '''Abdullah bin Nasser bin Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Thani''' ({{lang-ar|الشيخ عبد الله بن ناصر بن عبد الله الأحمد آل ثاني}}) is a Qatari businessman. He was appointed a non-executive member of board of directors of [[Doha Bank]] on 3 June 1996 and is also a member of the board of Nasser Bin Abdulla &amp; Sons Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dohabank.com.qa/1/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=_3tPzYbByYI%3d&amp;tabid=1151|title=Governance Report|accessdate=7 January 2012|work=Doha Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Sheikh Abdullah''' is from the Qatari [[House of Thani|ruling family]] and a distant relative of Qatar's previous ruler [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani|Sheikh Hamad]] and owns the Spanish [[La Liga|Segunda Division]] football club [[Málaga CF]] as well as several thoroughbred racing horses.

==Family==
According to the Royal Ark website, he is the great-grandson of [[Ahmed bin Muhammed Al Thani]], the brother of later emir [[Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani]] and son of [[Hakim (title)|Hakim]] [[Mohammed bin Thani]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalark.net/Qatar/qatar2.htm qatar2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Nasser bin Abdullah bin Ahmed Al Thani]], was the chairman of [[Nasser bin Abdulla &amp; Sons Group]] and after he died in 1990 chairmanship of the Group was bequeathed to his son Abdullah.

His namesake, [[Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani]], is his [[cousin|second cousin]]; the preceding [[emir]] of Qatar, [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]], is Abdullah's cousin once removed.

==Sports==
In June 2010, Sheikh Abdullah bought [[Málaga CF]] from [[Lorenzo Sanz]], whose son [[Fernando Sanz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.malagacf.com/noticias/la-llegada-de-shaikh-abdullah-abre-una-nueva-etapa-en-el-malaga-cf-2900.html|title=The arrival of H.H.

Sheikh Abdullah is currently a member of the board of directors of [[Qatar Equestrian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qatarequestrian.org/index.php?view=content&amp;itm=1024&amp;itmid=2&amp;local=0 Qatar Equestrian Federation – v1.0 «BETA PREVIEW»&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225135216/http://www.qatarequestrian.org/index.php?view=content&amp;itm=1024&amp;itmid=2&amp;local=0 |date=25 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Asia Squawk Box''''' is a television business news program on [[CNBC Asia]], aired Monday through Friday from 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.-9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. ([[Hong Kong]]/[[Singapore]]/[[Taiwan]] time). This programme is also aired on [[CNBC World]] in the United States at the respective time (5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. - 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Sunday through Thursday without [[daylight saving time]], 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. - 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. with DST), and on [[CNBC Europe]] from 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.-2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.

==Format==
''Asia Squawk Box'' (''ASB'') covers the opening of the Asian markets and is anchored by [[Akiko Fujita]] and [[Bernard Lo]] in Hong Kong. There is occasionally a guest host. The show has also let its guest hosts join in on the second and third hour just like its [[Squawk Box|US]] and [[Squawk Box Europe|European]] counterparts. Regular contributors include [[Sri Jegarajah]], Eunice Yoon (China), [[Emily Tan]] ([[Hong Kong]]) and Matthew Taylor ([[Sydney]]). Interviews with other analysts and C-level executives are also an essential part of the show.

==History==
''Asia Squawk Box'' debuted in February 1998 at 8.00 Singapore time in February 1998 when CNBC Asia merged with Asia Business News and it was presented by former CNBC Asia Morning Call personalities Rico Hizon (now with BBC World) and [[Geoff Cutmore]] (currently the main presenter of the show's counterpart in Europe, ''Squawk Box Europe'').  Bernard Lo and Cecilia Zecha came in to eventually replace Cutmore and Hizon respectively.  In October 1998, ''Asia Squawk Box'' was extended to 90 minutes and in late 1999, the show started at 7.30 SIN time.  In April 2000, ''Asia Squawk Box'' moved to 7.00 SIN time.  [[Christine Tan]] assumed anchoring duties in July 2000 and on 30 October 2000, the show was extended to two hours with the last half-hour being named Squawk Plus.

In July 2001, ''Asia Squawk Box'' aired for a full three hours like its [[Squawk Box|US counterpart]] from 7am to 10am SIN time.  Around this time, Steven Engel was added to the team as a stockwatcher.  In late 2002, Bettina Chua took over as anchor as Christine Tan was reassigned to the evening hours.  As a result of the cancellation of ''[[Asia Wake Up Call]]'', ''ASB'' moved to the 6 to 9am SIN time timeslot.

In April 2005, [[Martin Soong]] assumed the anchoring duties for the program after Chua's departure from the network.

Since 2006, the Asian version of ''Squawk Box'' has been guided editorially by Senior Producer Derrick McElheron, who also helped launch CNBC's ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]''. As of 2006-10-30 (the same day the Asia network debuted a new graphics package similar to its US and European siblings), the show began using the titles in use by its US counterpart since late 2005, replacing the previous one that was used from 2004-2006.

===2007 relaunch===
On 2007-03-26, with McElheron at the helm, ''Asia Squawk Box'' was relaunched with a new live set, replacing the virtual set it had used since its creation, and a new co-presenter in Amanda Drury.  On that day, the show started using the then-current US music package and returned to the 7 to 10am timeslot and being preceded to give way to a then-new programme, ''[[Squawk Australia]]''.

===2009-2014===
In 2009, Karen Tso took over anchoring duties from Amanda Drury, who moved back to Sydney and later to the US after the cancellation of ''Squawk Australia'' on June 11, 2010.  Former Bloomberg anchor Bernard Lo re-joined the network in early 2010, based out of Hong Kong.  He can now be seen regularly co-anchoring Squawk Box.  Additionally, ''Asia Squawk Box'' moved back to its new/old time slot (6am-9am Singapore/Hong Kong Time) on June 14, 2010.

In late-2011, it was announced that Tso was moving to CNBC Europe in London.  Lisa Oake re-joined the network as co-anchor of ''Asia Squawk Box'' in January 2012.

In early 2014, former Bloomberg anchor Susan Li joined CNBC Asia and replaced Lisa Oake (who left CNBC Asia at the end of 2013) as co-anchor of ''Asia Squawk Box.''

===2014-present===
On 31 March 2014, the show launched with a new live set in Hong Kong and moved back to the 7-10am SIN/HK timeslot.  Susan Li and Bernard Lo became the new co-anchors of ''Asia Squawk Box,'' which is now based in Hong Kong.  Martin Soong, who had been co-anchor from 2005–14, moved to a new program, ''Street Signs'' (which also shares the same name as its now-defunct US counterpart).  That program is co-anchored by Soong and [[Oriel Morrison]] (the latter who herself had previously been anchor of ''Cash Flow'', which was cancelled 28 March 2014).

On 9 February 2015, ''Asia Squawk Box'' debuted a new logo that is used by its US counterpart since 13 October 2014, but the theme music was originally not the same as its US and Europe versions.  That changed 27 April 2015, when the Asia version started using the same theme music as its US and Europe versions.

In mid-August 2015, the show briefly launched again in the Singapore Exchange studio after Susan Li left CNBC Asia to join its sister network in Europe as co-anchor of ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]''.  On 26 October 2015, Lo became the sole anchor of ''Asia Squawk Box'', which is once again based in Hong Kong.

On 8 February 2016, both the Asian and European versions started using the remastered ''Squawk Box'' logo that has been used by their US counterpart since 4 January 2016.

On 3 July 2017, Singapore-based anchor Oriel Morrison joined ''Asia Squawk Box'' as co-anchor of the show's third hour.

In February 2018, Akiko Fujita (formerly of ''[[The Rundown (CNBC Asia)|The Rundown]]'', which was based in Singapore) joined Lo in Hong Kong as co-anchor.

On 29 October 2018, ''Asia Squawk Box'' once again moved back to the previous 6-9am SIN/HK timeslot following the cancellation of ''The Rundown'' three days prior.

==Facts==
*Maria Bartiromo, who was part of the original [[Squawk Box|''US Squawk Box'']] team until the mid-2000s, was a guest co-anchor on ''ASB'' in 2006.  She was also a regular on ''ASB'' from late 2000 to early 2002 when the U.S. reverts to standard time from daylight saving time (late-October to March of the following year) to recap the US trading day.  At other times of the year, she appeared on the now canceled ''CNBC Today'' and ''Asia Wake Up Call''.  Bartiromo left CNBC at the end of November 2013.

The Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) is the world’s leading professional body for Accounting Technicians, with over 140,000 members worldwide. 

There are 4,250 licensed AAT accountants providing accountancy, tax and business advisory services to more than 400,000 British businesses. 

80% of the FTSE 100 employ an AAT apprentice within their finance function.

AAT was created by the merger of two founding institutes in 1980: the Institute of Accounting Staff (then a subsidiary of [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]]) and the Association of Technicians in Finance and Accounting (then a subsidiary of [[Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy|CIPFA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline - Accounting History|url=http://www.icaew.com/en/library/subject-gateways/accounting-history/resources/timeline/1968-2003| publisher=ICAEW}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Index of UK and Irish Accountancy and Professional Bodies |url=http://www.icaew.com/en/library/subject-gateways/accounting-history/resources/index-of-uk-and-irish-accountancy-and-professional-bodies |publisher=ICAEW |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006185850/http://www.icaew.com/en/library/subject-gateways/accounting-history/resources/index-of-uk-and-irish-accountancy-and-professional-bodies |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a technician level qualification offering higher apprenticeships which entitles those who have completed the exams and obtained relevant supervised work experience to become an accounting technician.  The AAT is based at 140 Aldersgate Street, London but has 43 branches across the UK with representation in the rest of the world including Hong Kong, Botswana and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimaglobal.com/Starting-CIMA/Starting-CIMA/Entry-Routes/students-or-professional-members/AAT/|title=CIMA - AAT Students and Members|website=www.cimaglobal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional recognition ==
The body was sponsored by four UK chartered accountancy bodies; CIPFA, ICAEW, CIMA and ICAS from 1980 until May 2017. After this date, ICAEW, CIPFA, CIMA and ICAS no longer participated in AAT’s governance structure and AAT took the decision to bring their sponsoring body partnerships to a close.

A strong relationship remains between AAT and its former sponsoring bodies, albeit on a more operational basis, with exemptions for the chartered qualifications remaining at the heart of those relationships.
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aat.org.uk/aats-governance-structure&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAT became a full member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC) in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifac.org/about-ifac/membership/members/association-accounting-technicians IFAC Membership] Retrieved August 1, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versus CAT ==
Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) used to be a sponsor of the AAT but broke away in order to form a rival qualification called the [[Certified Accounting Technician]] (CAT) award. The ACCA implemented this policy as it wanted a technician level qualification that offered accountancy apprenticeships based on the same business model as itself.

== In Scotland ==
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland is also keen to implement AAT courses into its own business model.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} It presently has no plans to develop an ICAS technician qualification in direct competition with the AAT's UK model as proposed in the late 1990s.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

== In South Africa ==
The [[South African Institute of Chartered Accountants]] decided to sponsor the AAT program offering higher apprenticeship accounting courses and it has expanded since 2011. AAT(SA) has no signatory powers for any of its South African members, this is because there is not sufficient audit content within the qualification offered. SAICA and AAT are working towards gaining authority in a number of other areas, such as [[Commissioner of Oaths]] and review status. This sort of authority does take time to approve and the new South African Company Legislation is not yet finalised.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aatsa.org.za/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examinations ==
Since 2010 every level of the AAT qualification has a number of modules, each of which culminate in a computer based assessment.

== Qualifications ==
The AAT Intermediate Level 3 qualification or Level 6 in Scotland, is approved for the University entrance system with a value of 160 UCAS tariff points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aat.org.uk/sites/default/files/assets/AAT_Level_3_Diploma_in_Accounting_Specification.pdf|title=AAT Qualification Specification - published 10/2012 (website accessed 01/01/2015)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is also included in the KS5 performance tables. The final AAT qualification, the AAT Advanced Level is equivalent to QCF Level 4 and SCQF Level 8.

Accounting Technicians, when certified as being experienced and competently qualified, can perform identical tasks to Chartered accountants with the exception of not being permitted to sign off company audits. This is largely irrelevant for AAT licensed accountants as their client base is almost exclusively formed of micro and small businesses who enjoy the small company audit exemption (employing less than 50 employees with a turnover below £10.1m or assets below £5.1m). 

AAT also licenses ATOL reporting accountants although it only has a small number of such members.

In 2014 AAT expanded its suite of qualifications and launched new courses in accounting, bookkeeping, computerised accounting, tax and business skills.

In 2017, AAT also launched a new membership category for bookkeepers (AATQB).

===Employer accreditation===
The AAT employer accreditation scheme recognises employers with a positive and planned approach to the professional development of their AAT members, whether through studying for an AAT qualification or, once qualified, supporting them in their continuing professional development.

AAT Accredited Employer Scheme provides the employer with a range of benefits including:

* Full and fellow members will automatically meet their mandatory CPD requirements by following their employer's training and development processes 
* Support in managing student member's 
* Advice on trainee recruitment and funding 
* AAT Accredited Employer logo and certificate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2121">'''Baldur Ágústsson''' is an [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] businessman, who ran for [[president of Iceland]] in [[Icelandic presidential election, 2004|2004]] and [[Icelandic presidential election, 2016|2016]].

Baldur started his career as a [[wireless operator]] on board a [[fishing boat]], and later became an [[air traffic controller]] at [[Reykjavík Airport]]. Meanwhile, he set up Iceland´s first security firm, Varði. In the early 2000s he lived in [[Britain (country)|Britain]] where he was engaged in real estate business. He was the main challenger against incumbent [[Olafur Ragnar Grimsson]] in the [[Icelandic presidential election, 2004|2004 Icelandic presidential election]] where he got 12.5% of the vote. It was only the second time a sitting president had been challenged and the first time a challenger got more than 6% of the vote.

His motivation for running was dissatisfaction with the President [[veto]]ing a media bill, which was the first use of a presidential veto in the history of Iceland. 

''"I personally believe that Ólafur Ragnar should not have used it on a smallish issue such as media bill. It is a bit like a lifeboat. You don’t use it when you want to go on a trip, you use it when there is an emergency and this was not an emergency."''&lt;ref&gt;http://grapevine.is/mag/feature/2004/06/25/baldur-agustsson/&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016 he announced his decision to run for president once more aiming to "restore respect for the presidency, to promote a better service to the sick, the elderly and the disabled, to promote friendship with foreign nations and operate the presidency within the framework of the budget."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2016/05/01/baldur_bydur_sig_fram/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bank of London and Montreal Limited''' was a [[joint venture]] between [[Bank of London and South America]] (BOLSA), a subsidiary of [[Lloyds Bank]], and [[Bank of Montreal]]. It was established in 1958 and headquartered in [[Nassau, Bahamas]].

==History==

*1958 Bank of London and South America, an associate of Lloyds Bank, and Bank of Montreal established Bank of London and Montreal as a 50-50 JV with headquarters in Nassau in the Bahamas.  BOLSA contributed its branches in the West Indies and northern South America, and Bank of Montreal contributed capital.
*1959 BOLAM established a branch in [[Jamaica]].
*1960 BOLAM established a branch in [[Trinidad]].
*1964 [[Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas)]] acquired one third of the shares of BOLAM.
*1965 [[Mellon Financial|Mellon National Bank]] acquired 15% of the shares in BOLAM. Lloyds' share fell to 24%. Bolam closed its offices in [[Venezuela]] and became a large shareholder in [[Banco La Guaira Internacional]], which had offices in [[Caracas]] and [[La Guaira]].
*1968 The [[Bank of England]] allowed Mellon to increase its shareholding to 25%.
*1970 BOLSA fully acquired BOLAM, which had 28 branches throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. In the divorce, Bolsa took back its branches.  Bank of Montreal got the Bahamian and Jamaican branches, and sold the branch and operations in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] to the government there, which used the acquisition as the foundation for a new bank, National Commercial Bank.  This is now [[First Citizens Bank]]. On April 17, 1970 Bank of Montreal incorporated the branches it took over as Bank of Montreal (Bahamas &amp; Caribbean), and in 1983 changed the name Bank of Montreal Bahamas Limited.
*1971 The Government of Jamaica purchased [[Bank of Montreal]]'s Jamaican operations, renaming them '''Bank of Surrey'''.  Bank of Surrey closed five months later. 
:In 1988 Bank of Montreal wanted to close the Bahamian operations so the Government of the Bahamas stepped in to keep them going.  The Government of The Bahamas created a 51-49 joint venture with [[Euro Canadian Bank]], which took over the new bank and renamed it Bank of The Bahamas.  This is now [[Bank of Bahamas International]].	
*1971 Lloyds combined Lloyds Bank Europe, BOLSA and BOLAM as subsidiaries of a new bank, Lloyds and Bolsa International Bank, of which Lloyds owned 55% and Mellon Bank 13%.  Within two years, Lloyds bought out Mellon Bank and the other minority shareholders.  It then renamed the bank Lloyds Bank International (LBI).   
*1975 LBI closed the Tokyo branch that BOLAM had established in 1971.
*1984 Lloyds merged in LBI.

'''Bellingcat''' (also rendered '''bell¿ngcat''') is a website founded by the British [[citizen journalist]] [[Eliot Higgins]]. Bellingcat publishes the findings of citizen journalist investigations into war zones and the [[criminal underworld]]. The site's contributors also publish guides to their techniques, as well as [[case studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/about/|title=About - bellingcat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellingcat began as an investigation of the use of weapons in the [[Syrian civil war]]. It first received international attention with its analysis of forged data on satellite images of the downing of the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] during the still ongoing [[War in Donbass|war in eastern Ukraine]].

==Name==
The name derives from the idiom "[[belling the cat]]", which comes from a medieval fable about mice who discuss how to make a cat harmless. One suggests hooking a bell around his neck, and all the mice support the idea but none is willing to do it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/To+bell+the+cat |title=To bell the cat - definition of To bell the cat by The Free Dictionary |website=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In March 2012, Eliot Higgins started a blog under the pseudonym Brown Moses, through which he published his research into video footage of the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brown-moses.blogspot.de/2012_03_01_archive.html |title=Brown Moses Blog: March 2012 |website=Brown-moses.blogspot.de |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He looked at hundreds of these short clips on the Internet, localized them, and examined details of the weapons used. As a result, Higgins was able to demonstrate that the Syrian regime was using [[cluster munition]]s and [[chemical weapon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/254405/kickstarter-funded-journalists-found-an-isil-training-camp-using-google-earth-and-bing-maps/|title=Kickstarter-funded journalists found an ISIL training camp using Google Earth and Bing Maps|date=24 August 2014|quote=for proving Syria was using chemical weapons from his bedroom in Leicester}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Higgins linked the significant [[chemical attack]] in [[Ghouta]] (the [[Ghouta chemical attack]]) to [[Bashar al-Assad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/bellingcat_brown_moses.php|title=Watch out for Bellingcat|work=Columbia Journalism Review|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Bellingcat was launched, major ground was covered over the course of its first investigation, the downing of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] (MH17). Bellingcat concluded that the downing was initiated by the Russian military; this was later confirmed by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), which found in a report dated 25 May 2018 that the downing of MH17 was initiated by the Russian military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.om.nl/onderwerpen/mh17-vliegramp/@103183/update-criminal/|title=Update in criminal investigation MH17 disaster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other notable investigations using [[Google Earth]], analysts from Bellingcat said that they had discovered the coordinates of an [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] training camp, as well as the site where an American journalist was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1278239551/bellingcat-the-home-of-online-investigations|title=Bellingcat: the home of online investigations|website=Kickstarter|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kristyan Benedict]], an [[Amnesty International]] campaign manager, told ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 2013 that many organisations had analysts but that Higgins was faster than many established investigation teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Batuman |first=Elif |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/25/rocket-man-2 |title=Rocket Man |publisher=[[The New Yorker]] |date=23 November 2013|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higgins launched the Bellingcat platform in 2014 with the help of private donations received through the crowdfunding platform [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Beauman |first1=Ned |title=How to Conduct an Open-Source Investigation, According to the Founder of Bellingcat |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=2018-08-30 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/how-to-conduct-an-open-source-investigation-according-to-the-founder-of-bellingcat |issn=0028-792X |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of funding comes from grants and donations, the other half from running workshops training people in the art of open-source investigations.&lt;ref name=millard&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/uk-leads-way-skripal-case-online-savvy-033611412.html |title=UK site leads the way in Skripal case with online savvy |work=AFP |via=[[Yahoo! News]] |author=Robin Millard |date=September 29, 2018 |accessdate=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Bellingcat has received grants from Google Digital News Initiative, Adessium, and the [[Open Society Foundations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Eliot |first1=Higgins |title=Bellingcat: the home of online investigations |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1278239551/bellingcat-the-home-of-online-investigations |website=Kickstarter |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation publishes guides on how to analyse data and how to create reports, such as "How to Scrape Interactive Geospacial Data" and "How to Identify Burnt Villages by Satellite Imagery".&lt;ref name=millard/&gt;

As of 2018, the company has four full-time staff plus Higgins, 11 members of its investigation team and 60 contributors.&lt;ref name=millard/&gt; The office is in [[Leicester]].&lt;ref name=millard/&gt;

==Notable cases==
===War in eastern Ukraine===
{{main|War in Donbass}}
On 21 December 2016, a report by Bellingcat was published which analyses the use of Russian artillery in the summer of 2014 against Ukrainian villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ArtilleryAttacks_withCover_EmbargoNote.pdf |format=PDF |title=Putin's Undeclared War : Summer 2014 : Russian Artillery Strikes Against Ukraine |author1=Sean Case |author2=Klement Anders |website=Bellingcat.com |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MH17===
[[File:MH17 map-lv.svg|thumb|351x351px|Route of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on July 17, 2014 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.]]

On July 17, 2014 [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]], a passenger flight from [[Amsterdam]] to [[Kuala Lumpur]], was shot down while flying over eastern Ukraine. All 283 passengers and 15 crew members died after the Boeing 777 was hit by a burst of "high-energy objects".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/09/world/europe/netherlands-ukraine-mh17-report/index.html |title=Report: MH17 hit by burst of 'high-energy objects' |author=Jethro Mullen|publisher=CNN|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press conference, Russian officials blamed the flight's destruction on Ukrainian forces and presented radar data, expert testimony and a satellite image. The radar data that showed another aircraft in the vicinity of MH17 was debunked as falling debris from MH17 by experts. A Spanish air traffic controller in Kiev gave interviews that stated that two Ukrainian fighter jets followed the Malaysian plane but the Spanish Embassy later said that there was no Spanish air traffic controller at either of Kiev's airports. The satellite image showed an aircraft firing on the airliner but Bellingcat exposed the photo as a composite of Google images, with the Malaysian airline logo even being misplaced.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2015/07/03/meet-eliot-higgins-putins-mh17-nemesis-345485.html|title=Meet Eliot Higgins, Putin’s MH17 Nemesis|author=Maxim Tucker |date=2015-06-22|website=Newsweek|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2014, the Bellingcat MH17 Investigation team published a report titled “MH17: Source of the Separatists’ Buk”. Based on evidence from open sources, primarily social media, the report links a Buk missile launcher that was filmed and photographed in eastern Ukraine on July 17 to the downing of the MH17 flight. The 35 page report, including photographs and maps, details the movements of the Buk in eastern Ukraine on July 17, evidence that the Buk originated from the [[53rd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade]] in Kursk, Russia, along with a convoy headed towards the Ukrainian border, and the activity of the vehicles seen in the same convoy after July 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Origin-of-the-Separatists-Buk-A-Bellingcat-Investigation1.pdf|title=Origin of the Seperatists' Buk|last=Bellingcat|first=|date=November 9, 2014|website=Bellingcat|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report was later echoed by the Dutch-led international [[Joint Investigation Team]]. The head of the Netherlands’ National Crime Squad, said they officially concluded that the missile that shot down MH17 "is from the 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade from Kursk in the Russian Federation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/investigators-russian-military-missile-downed-flight-mh17/2018/05/24/5b807ac2-5f34-11e8-b656-236c6214ef01_story.html?noredirect=on|title=Probe: Missile that downed MH17 came from Russia-based unit|date=24 May 2018|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Bellingcat published evidence that Russia had used [[Adobe Photoshop]] to manipulate satellite images of the MH17 disaster. Image forensics expert Jens Kriese of Germany maintained that Bellingcat's report used invalid methods to reach its conclusion.&lt;ref name=ders&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/expert-criticizes-allegations-of-russian-mh17-manipulation-a-1037125.html |title=Expert Criticizes Allegations of Russian MH17 Manipulation |work=Der Spiegel |author=Jens Kriese |date=June 4, 2015 |accessdate=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow-up report, Bellingcat published crowdfunded satellite imagery and further analysis that supported their claim.&lt;ref name=zeitde&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2015-06/bellingcat-russland-mh17-satellitenfotos-manipulation |title=Bellingcat kontert Kritik mit neuen Satellitenbildern |work=Zeit Online |language=German |author= |date=12 June 2015 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On December 20, 2017, Bellingcat published an article focusing on a section of the 2017 [[Intelligence and Security Committee]] report, which categorically stated that the British stance on the MH17 incident was that Russian forces were behind the orchestration and implementation of a plan to shoot down an aircraft. Whether the target was the MH17 passenger jet is not defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toler|first1=Aric|title=British Intelligence Report Confirms Russian Military Origin of MH17 Murder Weapon|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/12/20/british-intelligence-report-confirms-russian-military-origin-mh17-murder-weapon/|website=Bellingcat|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISCP Annual Report 2016-2017|url=https://b1cba9b3-a-5e6631fd-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/independent.gov.uk/isc/files/2016-2017_ISC_AR.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cqS8WVJqzXucCjkPcD1PkT4M4RJspBV9tHBYEJAZLobTFw2rG67hpLh55zoZsZ9_9Xrmtqiq4CzbwmhAUpzCTh3AW-lBjOdmWFYJds1-EYzBgJGRmPWubVpg_Yl0SrMUrYTcKGn-8HtPvf5AARiu60msxtT2SpjJfdv78EEeqkINZBUythVem1KHFtKbbziZLQNdiiOymaCinv1pUa1FIpSVaHOkjNwmyfFteiMvnTRX00Qz_0%3D&amp;attredirects=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syrian Civil War===
{{main|Syrian Civil War}}

[[File:ISIS (Grey) Territory Change 2014-2016.gif|thumb|ISIS (grey) territory change 2014–2016]]
Beginning in March 2011 after political protests turned violent,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12791738l|title=Middle East unrest: Three killed at protest in Syria |publisher=BBC News|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Syrian Civil War has been an ongoing conflict between the [[Syrian Arab Republic]], [[Syrian Opposition]], [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], and [[List of armed groups in the Syrian Civil War|other combatants]]. Bellingcat reports primarily analyse the factions at war, and what weapons and armor they utilize, as well as news that would normally go unreported by the mainstream media. Bellingcat utilizes a network of contributors who specialize in open source and social media investigation, and creates guides and case studies so others may learn to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.bellingcat.com/about/|title= About |last=Higgins|first=Elliot|website=Bellingcat|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Bellingcat published extensive evidence of chemical weapons being used on Syrian civilians, including children. Collecting and analysing video footage from local sources which apparently showed parts of [[chlorine]] cylinders, Higgins said that while the contents of the cylinders could not be verified "the injuries depicted in the videos all appear to be consistent with chemical exposure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.vice.com/article/syria-is-accused-of-suffocating-its-citizens-with-chlorine-bombs|title=Syria Is Accused of Suffocating Its Citizens with Chlorine Bombs|date=23 April 2014|work=Vice News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, Bellingcat published an article showing the use of [[cluster munition]]s were being used against the [[New Syrian Army]], in clear violation of the [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]]. Bellingcat provided photographic evidence from firsthand sources that the munitions used were identical to those used by the [[Russian Armed Forces|Russian Military]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/06/21/al-tanf-bombing-russia-assisted-isis-attacking-us-backed-fsa-group-cluster-bombs/|title=The al-Tanf Bombing: How Russia Assisted ISIS by Attacking an American Backed FSA Group with Cluster Bombs|last=Komar|first=Rao|website=Bellingcat|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008185930/https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/06/21/al-tanf-bombing-russia-assisted-isis-attacking-us-backed-fsa-group-cluster-bombs/|archive-date=2016-10-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, Bellingcat published an article detailing how rudimentary [[Quadcopter|drones]] were being used by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] to drop explosives onto opposition targets. Analysing footage from Twitter and other social media platforms, it was discovered that the drones were dropping modified [[40 mm grenade|40mm grenades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/uncategorized/2017/02/10/death-drone-bombs-caliphate/|title=Death From Above: The Drone Bombs of the Caliphate |last=Waters|first=Nick |website=Bellingcat|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellingcat also does extensive reporting into attacks that are not openly claimed by combatants.

In September 2016, Bellingcat released a fact-checking article in response to Russia denying the bombing of hospitals in Syria. The article analysed footage from YouTube and images from Facebook, cross referencing them with areas that were confirmed to be attacked by Russian forces. The article reported that the hospital in question was within the area under Russian attack, although Russia denies these claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/09/01/fact-checking-russias-claim-didnt-bomb-5-year-old-syria/|title=Fact-Checking Russia’s Claim that It Didn’t Bomb a 5-Year-Old in Syria |last=Al-Khatib|first=Hady|website=Bellingcat|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, Bellingcat published an investigative report on [[2017 al-Jina mosque airstrike|the bombing of a mosque in Aleppo]] that killed over 50 civilians.  The article included photographs of the remnants of the bomb used, and showed that the piece was identical to that of similar bombs used by the US military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2017/03/16/us-missile-remains-reportedly-recovered-from-site-of-aleppo-mosque-bombing/|title=CONFIRMED: US Responsible for ‘Aleppo Mosque Bombing’ |last=Triebert|first=Christiaan|website=Bellingcat|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yemeni Civil War===

Bellingcat published that in the [[2018 Hajjah Governorate airstrike]] the bomb was made by the American company [[Raytheon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2018/04/27/american-made-bomb-used-airstrike-yemen-wedding/|title=American-Made Bomb Used in Airstrike on Yemen Wedding - bellingcat|date=27 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, a Bellingcat investigation on [[Houthi]] broadcasts through their affiliated [[Almasirah]] news channel of missile attacks targeted against [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) airports the [[Abu Dhabi International Airport]] and [[Dubai International Airport]] was published. The investigation report concluded that "It is highly likely that a Houthi-led drone attack did not take place in Abu Dhabi or Dubai".&lt;ref name="BY"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2018/11/07/investigating-houthi-claims-drone-attacks-uae-airports/|title=Investigating Houthi Claims of Drone Attacks on UAE Airports|author=Khalil Dewan|publisher=bellingcat.com|date=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, the claims of the attacks constituted a a propaganda effort and followed a "propaganda pattern" claims by the [[Houthi]] leaders.&lt;ref name="BY"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skripal poisoning===
{{main|Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal}}
Following [[RT (TV network)|RT]]'s interview with the suspects of the Sergei Skripal poisoning case, Bellingcat published the suspects’ passport data showing inconsistencies in the official story, and possible links to the Russian secret service. The Russian foreign ministry rejected the report stating that it believed Bellingcat had ties to western intelligence. It noted Bellingcat's access to a Russian database not publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/09/14/skripal-poisoning-suspects-passport-data-shows-link-security-services/|title=Skripal Poisoning Suspect's Passport Data Shows Link to Security Services - bellingcat|date=14 September 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/15/documents-show-novichok-salisbury-suspects-alexander-petrov-ruslan-boshirov-links-defence|title=Documents reveal Salisbury poisoning suspects' Russian defence ministry ties|first=Andrew|last=Roth|date=15 September 2018|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the website said it had identified one of the suspects as decorated [[GRU]] [[colonel]] [[Anatoliy Chepiga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/salisbury-poisoning-suspect-is-russian-colonel-reports|title=Salisbury poisoning suspect identified as Russian colonel|first1=Andrew|last1=Roth|first2=Vikram|last2=Dodd|date=26 September 2018|website=the Guardian|accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2015, Eliot Higgins and Bellingcat received the special prize of the [[Hanns-Joachim-Friedrichs-Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hanns-joachim-friedrichs.de/index.php/pressemitteilung-2015.html |title=Pressemitteilung 2015 - Hanns-Joachim-Friedrichs-Preis |website=Hanns-joachim-friedrichs.de |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6934">'''Bernard "Bernie" Glieberman''' is an [[United States|American]] [[real estate]] mogul and the president of Crosswinds Communities. Despite having made his fortune in real estate, Glieberman was perhaps best known for, with his son [[Lonie Glieberman|Lonie]], making several unsuccessful and controversial forays into sports team ownership and management in the [[Canadian Football League]].

Glieberman's father died when Glieberman was 17 years old, and after this the young Bernard took over control of his family real estate holdings. By the age of twenty-one he was a partner in a real estate firm, and at thirty-one he was able to buy out his partner's shares. By 1971, he had started the Crosswinds Communities corporation, which he runs and in which he is the sole shareholder to this day.

==Football involvement==

From 1991 to 2006, Glieberman was involved as the financier of several football operations in [[Canada]] and the United States. Glieberman put up the money while Lonie usually handled media relations and football operations.

===The Rough Riders and Shreveport===

In 1991, Glieberman and his son arrived in Ottawa to bail out the troubled [[Ottawa Rough Riders]].  The once-proud team had not had a winning season since 1979.  The franchise was also in dire straits off the field as well as it was over [[Canadian dollar|C$]]1 million in debt. With his son as the franchise's frontman, Bernie bought the team for a dollar, assumed the debt, and provided the capital city's team with what must have seemed like stable ownership.  Their first season, [[1992 Ottawa Rough Riders season|1992]], showed a good deal of promise; the Rough Riders finished 9-9, only their second non-losing season in 13 years.&lt;ref name=CBC1&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/newsmakers/gliebermans.html Back in town again]. [[CBC Sports]], 2005-06-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

It did not take long, though, for the Gliebermans to lose most of the goodwill they had built up.  Before the [[1993 CFL season|1993]], the younger Glieberman fired general manager [[Dan Rambo]], a move that he later called a serious blunder in hindsight.  He then signed former [[National Football League]] [[Pro Bowl]] defensive lineman [[Dexter Manley]], who had been banned from the NFL for life due to [[cocaine]] abuse.  However, Manley had not played a meaningful down of football in almost a year, and it was soon apparent he was nowhere near his old [[Pro Bowl]] form.  When Lonie demanded that the coaches not only keep Manley in the starting lineup, but also bring back a couple of players cut in training camp, assistant coaches [[Jim Daley]] and Mike Roach quit rather than comply. Meanwhile, Bernie made noises about moving the team to the United States, further driving down enthusiasm.&lt;ref name=CBC1/&gt;

When it became apparent that the CFL would not even consider allowing one of the league's oldest franchises to move south of the border, Glieberman reached a deal with the league in which the Rough Riders franchise was split in half.  The Canadian half was sold to [[Bruce Firestone]] for $1.85 million and retained the Rough Riders' name, colours and history.  The American half became the [[Shreveport Pirates]], part of the ill-fated [[CFL USA]] expansion scheme. The Pirates, like the whole expansion, were a failure, going 8-28 over two seasons. Glieberman initially attempted to stay in for the long haul, trying to move the team to [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. However, city officials were put out upon discovering that Glieberman had faced a number of lawsuits over his CFL career for not paying the bills, and that an antique automobile he owned had even been impounded due to his non-payment on a scoreboard for [[Independence Stadium (United States)|Independence Stadium]].

===All-American Football League===
After the failure of his CFL experience, Glieberman tried again in football. In 1997, Glieberman proposed an  All-American Football League with the objective of playing by March 1998. Glieberman planned to play a 20-game season in the spring and summer and make money by having the league sell television advertising rather than the network. The league would have been a single-owner entity, but the teams would have been operated locally.  It also would have signed players before the draft in hopes of controlling costs.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, John. [http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/1997/02/03/story3.html New football league may play at RFK]. [[Washington Business Journal]], 1997-02-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Ottawa===

In May of [[2005 CFL season|2005]], Glieberman resurfaced in the CFL, purchasing the [[Ottawa Renegades]] after a season in which the league had financed the team. Lonie was once again installed as team president. The Renegades had struggled both financially and in the standings almost since their inception, and owner Bill Smith was sinking in red ink.  He sold majority interest to Glieberman while remaining as a minority owner.  The first move made by the Gliebermans was typically controversial: bringing 71-year-old [[Forrest Gregg]] as head of football operations after the latter had been out of professional football for ten years since his failed tenure as head coach of Glieberman's [[Shreveport Pirates]].  Lonie's [[Mardi Gras]] promotion of trying to lure women to Renegades games by offering them beads (a reward traditionally given in the celebration for the baring of breasts) was also criticized. Before the Renegades' final game of the 2005 season, Lonie announced the firing of popular head coach [[Joe Paopao]] and his staff, leaving them to coach the final game knowing that it would be their last. The Renegades missed the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/newsmakers/gliebermans2.html Enemy No. 1 in Ottawa]. [[CBC Sports]], 2006-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claiming $4 million in losses, Glieberman sought a $2 million loan after Smith pulled out.  The league, however, was not willing to agree to this, and put the Renegades up for sale on March 22.  Unable to find a buyer, the league suspended the Renegades' operations on April 9.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060420171316/http://www.tsn.ca/cfl/news_story.asp?ID=161969 CFL suspends operations of Renegades].

'''PT Bio Farma (Persero)''' is an Indonesian [[State-owned Enterprise in Indonesia|state-owned enterprise]] based in Bandung, Indonesia which produces vaccines and sera to support [[immunization]] in Indonesia and other countries. Bio Farma has entered into a pre-qualification list of the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]]. Bio Farma vaccine produced [[vaccine]] consists of [[virus]] (vaccines against [[measles]], [[polio]] and [[hepatitis B]]), and bacterial vaccines (vaccine DTP vaccine TT, vaccines DT, and vaccine BCG). Bio Farma vaccines have supplied vaccines to multiple countries through [[UNICEF]], [[PAHO]] and other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biofarma.co.id/profile/|title=Bio Farma profile  |date=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bce.unpad.ac.id/pt-bio-farma/ |title=Bio Farma profile  |date=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM s Lands Koepok Inrichting en het Instituut Pasteur exterieur van het gebouw Bandoeng. TMnr 60012974.jpg|thumb|right|Main Building of Bio Farma circa 1930]]

Bio Farma's history began during the [[Dutch East Indies]] period, when the colonial government founded {{lang|nl|Parc-vaccinogène}} (State Vaccine Development Agency) on 6 August 1890. The agency occupied a building in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Weltevreden – Batavia]], which is now [[Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital]]. Since its inception, {{lang|nl|Parc-vaccinogène}} focused on eliminating [[Infection|infectious diseases]], which leads to its cooperation with [[Pasteur Institute]]. Eventually, the agency was renamed to {{lang|nl|Parc-vaccinogène en Instituut Pasteur}} in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biofarma.co.id/en/sejarah-kami/|title=Sejarah PT Bio Farma (Persero)  |date=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the administration of [[Johan Paul van Limburg Stirum|J.P. van Limburg Stirum]], Hendrik Freerk Tillema recommended to move the capital of [[Dutch East Indies]] to Bandung  due to its natural conditions and hilly terrain, making it easier to defend. The idea was gradually accepted and began to be implemented by the Dutch colonial government in early 1920s after it was supported by Prof. J. Kolopper, Rector of [[Bandung Institute of Technology|''Technische Hoogeschool te Bandoeng'']] at the time. Government and private offices along with other agencies began moving to Bandung, including the foreign trade office, [[salvation army]], government bodies and {{lang|nl|Landskoepok Inrichling en Instituut Pasteur}}, which stayed in Bandung until the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://safitriapcantik.wordpress.com/profil/ |title=Sejarah Bio Farma|date=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency has experienced several changes in name and legal entity, which are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog-urangsunda.blogspot.co.id/2013/11/sejarah-berdirinya-biofarma-dok.html?m=1/ |title=Sejarah Bio Farma|date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elib.unikom.ac.id/files/disk1/485/jbptunikompp-gdl-taufiknugr-24217-1-unikom_t-i.pdf |title=Sejarah dan Perkembangan PT Bio Farma (Persero)|date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brainsworking''' refers to a strategy in [[business development]], based on the capacity to transfer [[knowledge]] from wide and diverse fields of experience, connect them and create entirely new and innovative results with the goal to foster sustainable [[business development]] (which also includes [[career|personal development]], [[entrepreneurship]], [[creativity]] and [[innovation]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://businessnetworksmanagement.blogspot.com/2006_07_01_archive.html Business, Networks, Management blog]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept, a [[word play]] on [[brain]]s and [[social network|networking]], has been created by [[Austria]]n entrepreneur and [[Chief networking officer]] [[Selma Prodanovic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=2950200 Article on Brainsworking in ''Der Standard'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept includes the ability to use [[networking intelligence]] and connected thinking skills in sharing and creating new knowledge in fostering development. Brainsworking understands networking as going beyond contact collection, but rather as interacting visions and ideas. It can also be used as a tool for [[sustainable development|sustainable human development]], as it builds on the fact that each human being is unique and has a unique [[competitive advantage]] to bring into the knowledge exchange network and contribute to sustainable progress in that way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.brainswork.at/html_englisch/brainswork_institute.htm# |title=Brainswork |access-date=2009-07-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815063833/http://www.brainswork.at/html_englisch/brainswork_institute.htm# |archive-date=2009-08-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''comprador''' or '''compradore''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|k|ɒ|m|p|r|ə|ˈ|d|ɔr}}) is a "person who acts as an agent for foreign organizations engaged in investment, trade, or economic or political exploitation".&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite web|title=comprador|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/comprador|website=oxforddictionaries.com|publisher=OXford University Press|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprador is a [[Indigenous peoples|native]] manager of [[Europe]]an business houses in [[East Asia|East]] and [[South East Asia]], and, by extension, social groups that play broadly similar roles in other parts of the world.

==Etymology and history==
The term ''comprador'', a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word that means ''buyer'', derives  from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''comparare'', which means ''to procure''.&lt;ref name=1911brit&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Comprador|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original usage of the word in East Asia meant a native servant in European households in [[Guangzhou]] in southern [[China]] or the neighboring [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[colony]] at [[Macao]] who went to market to [[barter]] their employers' wares.&lt;ref name=1911brit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bergere&gt;{{cite book |last= Bergere |first= Marie-Clarie |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= The Golden Age of the Chinese Bourgeoisie 1911-1937 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Bourgeoisie-1911-1937-Studies-Capitalism/dp/0521320542/ref=reader_auth_dp|year=1989 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=[[Cambridge]] |id=0521320542 |pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term then evolved to mean the native contract suppliers who worked for foreign companies in East Asia or the native managers of firms in East Asia.&lt;ref name=1911brit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bergere/&gt; Compradors held important positions in southern China buying and selling tea, silk, cotton and [[yarn]] for foreign corporations and working in foreign-owned [[bank]]s.&lt;ref name=Bergere/&gt; [[Robert Hotung]], a late-nineteenth-century compradore of the British-owned [[Hong (business)|trading conglomerate]] [[History of Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.|Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.]] was believed to be the richest man in Hong Kong by the age of 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Modern History of Hong Kong|first1=Steve|last1=Tsang|url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=7JC856mG72EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Tsang,+Steve+(2007).+A+Modern+History+of+Hong+Kong.&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjznZLb4IbQAhVEx5AKHSuOD0EQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Tsang%2C%20Steve%20(2007).%20A%20Modern%20History%20of%20Hong%20Kong.&amp;f=false|publisher=I. B. Taurus &amp; Company|isbn=978-1-84511-419-0|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Marxism]], the term ''comprador [[bourgeoisie]]'' was later applied to similar trading-class in regions outside of East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mao Zedong]]; Michael Y. M. Kau, John K. Leung (eds.) [https://books.google.com.br/books?id=ftv7ks-Ehq0C&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=%22comprador+bourgeoisie%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-1BWKYPi6t&amp;sig=MeY24Yz9EKF6Q_48Vo4A5Ai-YOw&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic3q6224bQAhXMk5AKHVjuDgsQ6AEIbjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22comprador%20bourgeoisie%22&amp;f=false ''The Writings of Mao Zedong - Volume II 1949-1976: January 1956-December 1957'']. M.E. Sharpe, 1992, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mao Zedong]]. [https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_1.htm "Analysis if the classes in Chinese Society"]. [[Marxists.org]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Slobodan Antonić]]: [http://www.nspm.rs/politicki-zivot/kompradori.html Компрадори]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=History of the Russian Revolution|author=[[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky, Leon]]|url=https://www.marxists.org/ebooks/trotsky/history-of-the-russian-revolution/ebook-history-of-the-russian-revolution-v1.pdf|ISBN=978-1931859-45-5|year=2008|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the emergence (or re-emergence) of [[globalization]], the term comprador has reentered the lexicon to denote trading groups and classes in the [[developing world]] in subordinate but mutually advantageous relationships with metropolitan capital. The Egyptian Marxist [[Samir Amin]] has discussed the role of compradors in the contemporary global economy in his recent work.&lt;ref&gt;Amin, Samir (2011). [https://unu.edu/publications/books/maldevelopment-anatomy-of-a-global-failure.html ''Maldevelopment: Anatomy of a Global Failure''], Pambazuka Press, Oxford. {{ISBN|1906387796}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Indian economist, [[Ashok Mitra]], has accused the owners and managers of firms attached to the [[Information technology in India|Indian software industry]] of being compradors.&lt;ref&gt;Mitra, Ashok.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1133">'''Demand vacuum''' in [[economics]] and [[marketing]] is the effect created by consumer [[demand]] on the supply chain.  The term refers to an analogy whereby consumer demand for a product or service creates a "vacuum" at the end of the supply chain which "pulls" the product through the chain by causing the suppliers to provide more product.

The marketing strategy of [[pull strategy]] aims to create a demand vacuum through advertising and promotion to the consumer.  This is to be compared with [[push strategy]] that tries to push the product through the supply chain by promoting the product to sellers and encouraging them to carry it.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Kotler, Gary Armstron, ''Principles of Marketing'', p. 442, Pearson Education, 2010 {{ISBN|0137006691}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A demand vacuum can cause a local shortage of a product when local demand is far exceeded by demand in [[export]] markets. The result is little or no availability of a product in its originating market.

{{Feminism sidebar}}

'''Double burden''' is a term used to describe the workload of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid [[Feminist economics#Domestic systems|domestic labor]].&lt;ref name="Working Parents"/&gt; This phenomenon is also known as ''[[The Second Shift]]'' as in [[Arlie Hochschild]]'s book of the same name.&lt;ref name="The Second Shift"&gt;Hochschild, Arlie and Anne Machung. 1990. ''The Second Shift''. Avon Books: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on [[household chores]] and caring work, such as [[childrearing]] or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional [[gender roles]] that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk of [[unpaid work]].

Efforts have been made to document the effects of this double burden on couples placed in such situations.&lt;ref name="Paid and Domestic"/&gt;  Many studies have traced the effects of the gendered division of labor, and in most cases there was a notable difference between the time men and women contribute to unpaid labor.

==Etymology==
The term ''double burden'' arises from the fact that many women, as well as some men, are responsible for both domestic labor and paid labor. However, due to the thinking that a woman's time spent in domestic work is more valuable than a woman's time spent doing paid work, and that a man's time spent doing paid work is more valuable than a man's time spent doing domestic work, there is the issue of women having to do a large amount of both paid and unpaid work, leading to the double burden.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some alternative terms for double burden include : ''double day,'' ''second shift'', and ''double duty''.&lt;ref&gt;Suzana Smith and Diana Converse. ''[https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/fm288#FOOTNOTE_2 Double Day Work: How Women Cope With Time Demands].'' University of Florida, IFAS Extension.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unequal work burdens around the world==

===In the industrialized world===

====Pre-World War II====
The traditional female homemaker–male breadwinner model characterized female employment prior to World War II. At the turn of the 20th century in the continental United States, only 18 percent of women over the age of 15 reported receiving income non-farm employment.&lt;ref name="Women, War, and Wages"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daron |last=Acemoglu |first2=David H. |last2=Autor |first3=David |last3=Lyle |title=Women, War, and Wages: The Effect of Female Labor Supply on the Wage Structure at Midcentury |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=112 |issue=3 |year=2004 |pages=497–551 |doi=10.1086/383100 |quote=Samples include men and women aged 14–64 in the year for which earnings are reported, who are not residing in institutional group quarters (such as prisons or barracks), and are not employed in farming. (p. 511) |citeseerx=10.1.1.207.6838 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These women were typically young, single, white, and native-born. In contrast, married women in the non-farm labor force were "predominantly blacks or immigrants and very poor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenfeld |first=Rachel A. |year=1996 |title=Women's Work Histories |journal=Population and Development Review |volume=22 |issue= |pages=199–222 |doi=10.2307/2808012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Working mothers often exited the labor force once their children were old enough to earn money.

The outpouring of occupational opportunities in the early 1920s, such as in "[[cafeterias]], [[nursery (room)|nurseries]], laundries and other facilities seemed to release women from domestic chores and freed them to participate fully in the sphere of production."&lt;ref name="The Double Burden" /&gt;

This migration of women into the workforce shook the traditional ideology of gender roles, but importantly, it was the catalyst to the double burden becoming noticeable.&lt;ref name="The Double Burden" /&gt; The 1930s "encouraged women to fulfill what [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] termed the "great and honorable duty that nature has given" them.&lt;ref name="The Double Burden" /&gt; Evident in the Soviet Union, "an officially sponsored cult of [[motherhood]], buttressed by anti-abortion legislation" accompanied by a "depression of living standards" led to industry's immense demand for laborers which got women into the industrial [[Division of labour|workforce]] in unprecedented numbers".&lt;ref name="The Double Burden" /&gt; Urban women thus found themselves assuming the "double burden" (also known as the "double shift") of waged work outside the home and the lion's share of unpaid labor within it."&lt;ref name="The Double Burden" /&gt; The Second World War is typically seen as a catalyst for increasing female employment. Best exemplified by  [[Rosie the Riveter]] propaganda of an efficient, patriotic, woman worker, World War II increased demand for female labor to replace that of the "16&amp;nbsp;million men mobilized to serve in the Armed Forces".&lt;ref name="Women, War, and Wages" /&gt; While a substantial number of women worked in war factories, the majority of jobs were in the service sector. This caused the gendered expectations for that time to be altered and roles to be both tested and reassigned for the incoming decades.&lt;ref name="The Double Burden" /&gt;

====Post-World War II====
The post-World War II period is marked by relatively high levels of female participation in the workforce, particularly in industrialized countries. Although a large proportion of women exited the workforce immediately following World War II, the idea of working class women was able to take root and normalize. "In 2001, 47 percent of U.S. workers were women, and 61 percent of women over the age of 15 were in the labor force." Besides an increased demand for women's labor, other factors contributed to the growth of their participation, such as more educational opportunities and later marriage and childbearing ages.

The idea of the double burden is more evolved with the times concerning both sexes and their newfound roles.&lt;ref name="Paid and Domestic" /&gt; The role of a provider and caregiver is sometimes expected of women, but as more women enter the workforce, an 'independent' ideology seems to take effect and forces some women to decide between a career and family. Some may choose strictly one or the other, others may choose to carry the burden of both lifestyles. Some "modern men tend to believe in the principle of equal sharing of domestic labor, but fail to actually live up to that belief."&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family" /&gt; The constant tug of war regarding one's time and where it could, should but will be spent creates a new speed bump that is a little bit higher than the previous ones.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family" /&gt; Modern times illuminate the dilemma that many dual-income couples face when trying to reconcile unpaid domestic work and paid employment.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family" /&gt; The burden of encompassing both [[ideologies]] plays a toll on both sexes in today's societies.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family" /&gt;

===South America===
Due to globalization in the past thirty years, the power of the unskilled worker has diminished, and thus, the [[informal economy]] has flourished. In [[Latin America]], there is an abundant number of workers to help out with [[Domestic worker|domestic work]], and consequently, domestic service is cheap, diminishing the family tensions surrounding the issue of domestic work. Currently, about half of the working population is employed in the informal sector, leading to "unemployment, underemployment, and social exclusion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Martha Alter |last=Chen |title=Women in the informal sector: A global picture, the global movement |publisher=Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study |url=http://www.cpahq.org/cpahq/cpadocs/module6mc.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, there has been a serious delay in providing [[welfare]] for the care of children and the elderly, because the pressure to provide aid for working families is minimal. In addition, domestic workers, many of them women, often leave their countries to work in the informal sector in northern countries in order to increase income for their families, also delaying the pressure for governments to provide aid to these families. However, there has been a change since the 2000s in thinking about unpaid work due to the influx of paid jobs for women and the shortage of people available to do domestic work.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lourdes |last=Beneria |year=2008 |title=The Crisis of Care, International Migration, and Public Policy |journal=Feminist Economics |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=1–21 |doi=10.1080/13545700802081984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the increase in jobs for women has had benefits in policy changes for families with working parents, there has been debates about the conditions of the work places. In Mexico, there is an influx of the [[Maquiladora|maquila]] industry, which produces products that will be sold in the developed nations. The mostly female workforce is often exploited by having unsafe working conditions, and stress is a major cause of many illnesses of these women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Hilary |last=Abell |year=1999 |title=Endangering Women's Health for Profit: Health and Safety in Mexico's Maquiladoras |journal=Development in Practice |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=595–600 |jstor=23317585 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another increasing issue is the rise in [[conditional cash transfer]] programs in Latin America, such as the ''[[Oportunidades]]'' program in [[Mexico]]. Although this program is meant to provide poor families with an increase in income, the conditionalities has led to a time poverty for the family members who are in charge of fulfilling the conditions, most oftentimes the woman. This has increased the inequality of work burden within the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sarah |last=Gammage |year=2010 |title=Time Pressed and Time Poor:  Unpaid Household Work in Guatemala |journal=Feminist Economics |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=79–112 |doi=10.1080/13545701.2010.498571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Latapi |first=A. E. |last2=Rocha |first2=M. G. |year=2008 |chapter=Girls, Mothers, and Poverty Reduction in Mexico: Evaluating Progresa-Oportunidades |editor-first=S. |editor-last=Razavi |title=The Gendered Impacts of Liberalization: Towards Embedded Liberalism? |pages=435–468 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-95650-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Europe===
Since the 1960s, [[Western Europe]] has been participating in a series of political debates to increase [[women’s rights]] in the workforce. In the 2000s, there has been a change from considering women’s rights to a mother’s rights, focusing on the rights of pregnant women as well as mothers. However, there have been issues with creating laws specifically for mothers.  There is still the inherent [[gender bias]] that women are the ones to care for children.&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Guerrina (2002). ''Mothering in Europe: Feminist Critique of European Policies on Motherhood and Employment,'' European Journal of Women Studies 9(1). doi: 10.1177/1350506802009001381&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parts of Western Europe, especially [[Scandinavia]]n countries have been creating family friendly policies that have aided them in equalizing the gender difference in participation in the work force.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nordic countries have the highest female participation rates in the work force in the world and salary differences are among the lowest.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;(2013). ''[[The Global Gender Gap Report]], ''World Economic Forum.&lt;/ref&gt; Government aid in providing care to the elderly and the young have enabled women in Scandinavia to be a part of the working population at nearly as high a rate as men.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Himmelweit | first = Susan | authorlink = Susan Himmelweit | title = Making visible the hidden economy: the case for gender-impact analysis of economic policy | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–70 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/13545700110104864 | date = 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13545700110104864 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of government aid include paid parental leave and benefits and post maternity re-entry programs. Such programs have led to a greater participation of women in the workforce, as well as a higher birth rate, and a robust economy.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Eastern Europe===
Under communism, everyone was guaranteed employment. However, women suffered the double burden of paid and unpaid work, leading to lower birth rates. The commitment to social equality and the issue of declining birth rates allowed women to have some rights, such as child care and child allowances.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Molyneux |first=M. |year=1995 |title=Superwomen and the Double Burden: Women's Experience of Change in Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union |journal=Feminist Studies |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=637–645 |doi=10.2307/3178205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the Soviet Union, maternity leave was extended to three years and part-time work was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roudakova |first=N. |last2=Ballard-Reisch |first2=D. |year=1999 |title=Femininity and the Double Burden: Dialogues on the Socialization of Russian Daughters into Womanhood |journal=Anthropology of East Europe Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the collapse of communism, many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place. Although there has been an increase in female workers, their need for welfare support such as child care has not been met, and has been ignored.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

===Asia===
In Western and Southern [[Asia]], women represent only a third of the work force.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Martha Chen, Joann Vanek, Francie Lund, James Heintz
with Renana Jhabvala, Christine Bonner (2005). ''[http://www.unifem.org/attachments/products/PoWW2005_eng.pdf Progress of the World's Women]''. [[UN Women]].&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them, even women in more modernized Asian countries, are involved in the informal sector, in traditional jobs for women, such as caring or teaching, without benefits such as employee health insurance or pension plans.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Jeemol Unni, (2004). [http://wiego.org/sites/wiego.org/files/publications/files/Unni_Securing.Worker.Rights.pdf Globalization and Securing Rights for Women Informal Workers in Asia],'' Journal of Human Development, 5(3). ''doi: 10.1080/1464988042000277233&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of the double burden is exacerbated in Asian countries due to the large cultural norm of women doing care work held by both men and women. In many developed countries, women drop out of work when they have children in order to have more time to take care of them.&lt;ref&gt;(2012). Women Matter: An Asian Perspective, ''McKinsey &amp; Company. ''&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries where women have to do paid work in order to feed their family, there is a lack of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to the large amount of informal work available.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many women have jobs in the informal industry, and often do home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the [[Work Intensity|work intensity]] by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Maria S. Floro &amp; Anant Pichetpongsa (2010). [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13545701.2010.499657 Gender, Work Intensity, and Well-Being of Thai Home-Based Workers], ''Feminist Economics'', 16(3), 5-44, doi: 10.1080/13545701.2010.499657&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

===Gender ideology===
"Gender ideologies are linked to beliefs about appropriate behaviour for men and women".&lt;ref name="Gender Attitudes and Housework"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chesters |first=Jenny |year=2012 |title=Gender Attitudes and Housework: Trends over Time in Australia |journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=511–526 |jstor=23267812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialization plays a major role in determining gender ideologies and what's valued in one time and culture may not necessarily transcend to another. Traditional gender ideologies have contributed to the double burden because it posits women as caretakers, men as providers, and each gender occupying their own sphere of influence. Although research has shown that attitudes about gender roles have become more egalitarian over the past few decades, "these changes in gender attitudes have not been accompanied by corresponding changes in the allocation of housework".&lt;ref name="Gender Attitudes and Housework"/&gt;

===Labor market constraints===
Despite women's increasing participation in the work force, a gender division of labor persist. There are a number of constraints in the labor market that contribute to the double burden. "Women are disproportionately represented in informal work and concentrated among lower-quality jobs within self-employment."&lt;ref name="2009 World Survey"&gt;{{cite web |work=World Survey |year=2009 |title=Access to Full Employment and Decent Work |pages=27–40 |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/impact_bdpfa/EP2%20-%20Schmidt_Final%20[consolidated].pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The informal market is generally precarious and characterized by low wages, few benefits, and a lack of social protections that are offered in the formal market. Even within the formal market, there is [[occupational segregation]] and a gender wage gap. Occupational segregation can be either horizontal or vertical: horizontal segregation limits women to certain sectors and occupations, while vertical segregation restricts them to particular positions within occupational hierarchies. Men and women are even found at different levels of the occupational hierarchy. The "[[glass ceiling]]" is the relative absence of women in senior or managerial positions due to institutional barriers and norms. Even in female-dominated occupations, men often occupy the more skilled and better paid positions.

[[File:US Gender pay gap, 1980-2009.001.png|thumb|US Gender pay gap, 1980–2009.001]]
The gender wage gap is a possible consequence of occupational segregation. The gender wage gap is the "difference between wages earned by women and men".&lt;ref name="2009 World Survey"/&gt; In 2008, globally, men were estimated to earn 16.5 per cent more than women. The gender wage gap is narrowing, but progress remains slow. Additionally, the narrowing of the gender wage gap may be attributed to a decrease in men's wages instead of an increase in women's wages. "The persistent gender wage gap across regions may reflect a number of factors, including women's continued disadvantage in terms of education and skills; their lack of an organized voice and bargaining power; gender-specific constraints on their labour market mobility; and their relatively high involvement in part-time or temporary jobs."&lt;ref name="2009 World Survey"/&gt; Many characteristics of the labor market constrain the employment opportunities of women and make it easier for them to be responsible for care work.

===Societal pressures===
There are various societal pressures that combine to create the double burden, including some economic thinking of [[Domestic worker|domestic work]], thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion that women are more likely to ask for [[maternity leave]] than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to [[economic growth]] of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as [[Sweden]] are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive [[workers]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lulie |last=Aslaksen |first2=Charlotte |last2=Koren |first3=Marianne |last3=Stokstad |year=2000 |title=The Effect of Child Care Subsidies: A Critique of the Rosen Model |journal=Feminist Economics |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=95–103 |doi=10.1080/135457000337705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Carmen |last=Sirianni |first2=Cynthia |last2=Negrey |year=2000 |title=Working Time as Gendered Time |journal=Feminist Economics |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=59–76 |doi=10.1080/135457000337679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on [[female employment]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Political pressure===
One of the political pressures, it is suggested by Susan Himmelweit is the issue of whom to empower. When there are considerations of policies, politicians usually only consider work as paid labor, and do not take into account the interdependence between unpaid work and paid work. It is also often common to think that women make economic decisions similarly to men. This is typically not the case, because for men, payment is simply a compensation for lost [[leisure time]]. However, for women, when they are working in the paid sector, they are still losing money because they have to make provisions for the domestic labor they are unable to do, such as caring for children or making dinner from scratch due to lack of resources such as [[child care]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jen |last=Roesch |year=2004 |title=Turning back the clock? Women, work, and family today |journal=International Socialist Review |url=http://www.isreview.org/issues/38/women_family.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her net financial gain is less than the financial gain of a man because she has to spend her earnings on providing for these provisions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, increasing paid work hours in order to have more money may have negative effects on the woman due to the increased total work hours and decreased leisure time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Natalie |last=Chen |first2=Paola |last2=Conconi |first3=Carlo |last3=Perroni |date=May 2007 |title=Women’s Earning Power and the ‘Double Burden’ of Market and Household Work |work=CEPR Discussion Paper No. DP6269 |ssrn=1135507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, policies that give greater power to people who do paid labor, such as cutting back on [[public expenditure]] in order to lessen [[income tax]]e&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have an adverse effect on [[female employment]] and the effect that the double burden has on females. Such policies give greater power and consideration towards people who work in the paid sector, and less towards people who work in the unpaid sector.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{Main|occupational segregation}}

Another political issue surrounding the double burden is what sort of policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant can be seen as disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is [[gender segregation]] continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Barbara |last=Petrongolo |year=2004 |title=Gender Segregation in Employment Contracts |journal=[[Journal of the European Economic Association]] |volume=2 |issue=2–3 |pages=331–345 |doi=10.1162/154247604323068032  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Tamara |last=Hervey |first2=Jo |last2=Shaw |year=1998 |title=Women, Work and Care: Women's Dual Role and Double Burden in Ec Sex Equality Law |journal=Journal of European Social Policy |volume=8 |issue=43 |pages= |doi=10.1177/095892879800800103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separate notion of paid work vs. unpaid work===
As the term double burden might suggest, when people consider paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - that the man or woman is doing one or the other, but not at the same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of [[Work Intensity|work intensity]], where the person undertakes many activities at the same time in order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Maria Sagrario |last=Floro |year=1995 |title=Women's well-being, poverty, and work intensity |journal=Feminist Economics |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=1–25 |doi=10.1080/714042246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for [[child care]] and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This [[coping mechanism]] of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, many [[Caribbean]] rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Increased nuclearization of family===
Due to the increasing trend of decreased fertility rate, there has been an increased nuclearization of the family, where families have less immediate relatives to depend on in times of need. Because of this phenomenon, families do not have an extended family to depend on when they need a caretaker or someone to do domestic work, and must turn to market substitutes or a member of the immediate family doing both domestic and paid work instead.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Gender differences==

===Women===

Many studies have been done to investigate the division of household labor within couples, and more specifically, on the [[gender roles]] played by a variety of people worldwide. According to The State of the World's Children 2007, women generally work longer hours than men regardless if they live in a developed or developing country.&lt;ref name= "The State of the World's Children 2007"&gt;UNICEF. 2007. The State of the World’s Children. New York: United
Nations Children’s Fund.&lt;/ref&gt; Most studies found that when both parents are faced with a full-time job, women are faced with a higher amount of a domestic workload than men.&lt;ref name="Paid and Domestic"/&gt; According to the World Bank Latin American and Caribbean Studies, Mexican women in the labor force still spend approximately 33&amp;nbsp;hours each week performing household responsibilities. In contrast, husbands only contribute approximately 6&amp;nbsp;hours each week. Even more striking, "daughters contribute 14&amp;nbsp;hours weekly helping their mothers, while sons spend the same time as their fathers (that is, 5–6&amp;nbsp;hours weekly)."&lt;ref name="Inequality in Latin American and the Caribbean"&gt;De Ferranti, David. 2004. ''Inequality in Latin American and the Caribbean: Breaking with History?''. World Bank, Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a study done by Statistics Canada's General Social Survey of 10,000 households, the average man spent under two hours a day dealing with childcare and house work while women on average spent a little more than three.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; This study highlights the unequal distribution of labor between partners.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; Of the people surveyed, under fifteen percent of the couples agreed on doing around the same amount of work in the house.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; About 83 percent of women participated in housecleaning and food preparation compared to only 51 percent of men who were surveyed.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt;

John Frederick Conway's book, ''The Canadian Family in Crisis,'' explores effects of the double burden by gender. In Conway's studies, he discovers the physical, emotional, and psychological differences between men and women faced with the double burden in Canada.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; In these studies it was found that women who are raising children and are in the workforce are more prone to have anxiety and many other stress related effects than the women who are just faced with one of the two burdens.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt;

===Men===

Even though the effects of raising children and having a career simultaneously are mostly seen in women throughout many societies, the men in such situations are affected greatly as well.&lt;ref name="Making Men"/&gt; This is not seen in all situations in males because the effects on men differ greatly from how females are affected by this extra responsibility.&lt;ref name="Making Men"/&gt; In ''The Canadian Family in Crisis'', the author suggests a reason for these effects to go unnoticed in most studies and surveys.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; This is because women's stress can be seen through direct labor consisting of housework and career whereas men's stress, in most cases, mostly come from decision making and [[work-family conflict]]s.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; These situations arise where the male must make the best choice for the future of his family.&lt;ref name="Making Men"/&gt; Specifically, these include things such as workload, overtime hours, shift decisions, and even accepting a promotion or a transfer.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; In these situations, the man is forced to make major choices that will affect the entire family, which brings on more stress.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; The effects also go unnoticed since, in traditional [[gender roles]], the male is supposed to be the backbone of the family and, in the past, it would have been seen as weakness for the male to display his emotions to the rest of the family.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; In surveys and studies done, most males would not like to be seen as too weak to handle his responsibilities as the role of the adult male in the household, which in the past has consisted of being the major economical supporter and physical figure for the family. With this in mind, it is very possible that some may have lied when surveyed about these topics.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt;

==Types==

===Work vs. family===
[[Parenting]] is a large task within itself, and when a parent has a career as well, it can cause a double burden, or [[work–family conflict]]. Strain begins to develop when women and men find that the demands of their family are conflicting with the demands from their job.&lt;ref name="Paid and Domestic"/&gt; When one is faced with a double burden like this, it affects how decisions are made within a career and in a family; this burden could potentially effect when a couple decides to have children.&lt;ref name="The Double"/&gt; 75% of all women who have jobs are in their childbearing prime.&lt;ref name="JUGGLING WORK"/&gt; When the conflict between one's family and work presents itself, the unpaid work that is being done in the home may be cut down, because of the certain health effects, or as a solution to deal with the greater demands from the workplace.&lt;ref name="Paid and Domestic"/&gt; Social outings and visits, and family dinners are two of the first things that get cut back on due to the work/family conflict.&lt;ref name="work and family"/&gt; In a study by Ari Väänänen, May V. Kevin, et al. found that if a man put a higher importance on their family, were more likely to stay home from work in order to deal with extreme family demands.&lt;ref name= "Paid and Domestic"/&gt; Ways that the double burden can be lessened for is with hired help in the house, day-care facilities, and longer maternity leaves for women.&lt;ref name="The Double"/&gt; For instance, in [[Norway]] women are allowed the options of 10&amp;nbsp;months of maternity leave, where they will get 100% of their pay, or 12&amp;nbsp;months leave, where they will only paid 80% of their earnings.&lt;ref name="The Double"/&gt; Some companies are realizing the effect the double burden of work and a family is having on their employees and are offering flexible work schedules in order to help their employees cope.&lt;ref name="JUGGLING WORK"/&gt; Not only do these flexible hours help the employee deal with their stress, but it also benefits the company because workers are happier, less likely to be absent, more productive, and the turnover rate is lower for the company.&lt;ref name="JUGGLING WORK"/&gt; As Sophia Mwangi says, "Parenthood is a joy. Let us never be burdened by it but let's celebrate the joy that it brings. Celebrate those first steps or words, the first school play, their graduation day, passing those exams, landing their first job, getting married, making you grandparents. Whatever it is, let's celebrate our children. It's not easy, but the art of juggling can always be mastered!"&lt;ref name="Juggling"/&gt;

===Family vs. school===
Raising a family is not an easy task, and deciding to go back to school while raising a family can be a monumentual decision for the family says Carol Jacobs of the Jewish Employ-ment &amp; Vocational Service. Her advice to those considering going back to school is, "Talk to an educational consultant and people in the field you want to be in."&lt;ref name="Juggling School and Family"/&gt; She adds, "This is a commitment and the decision should involve your family. Will you be available to go to your child's softball game or have time to cook dinner?"&lt;ref name="Juggling School and Family"/&gt; There are many reasons why someone may put off to school until their children are older, such as not wanting to leave them in the hand of a baby sitter constantly at such a young age.&lt;ref name="90s FAMILY"/&gt; However, once the children get older the parent pursuing an education, may start missing school events that they would have normally attended.&lt;ref name="90s FAMILY"/&gt; The guilt of having to leave a child while attending to educational matters is less when the child is old enough to be able to ask questions about where their parent is and comprehend the response.&lt;ref name="Back to school?"/&gt; Even though pursuing an education while nurturing a family will have its cost, the benefits include getting a higher paying job, gaining more knowledge, and becoming more stable financially.&lt;ref name="Back to school?"/&gt; Most of the time this burden will include the person trying to balance a job along with their family and schooling, because they still need to work in order to provide for their family at the present moment. For people who have a hard time fitting classes into their schedule around the needs of their family, there are options where they will be required to do all of the work for a course, but it will all take place online.&lt;ref name="Back to school?"/&gt; For example, the [[University of Delaware]] and the [[University of Phoenix]] Online have both [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] and [[Master of Science in Nursing]] programs for people to complete online.&lt;ref name="Back to school?"/&gt;

===Single vs. married parents===

====Single parent double burdens====
"Single Parents do not typically have the luxury of dividing tasks between two adults in the home."&lt;ref name="Midlife"/&gt; "The Parents in a married-couple family may be able to divide their tasks so that one parent specializes more in work-related and income-producing activities and the other parent specializes more in home-related, non-income producing activities."&lt;ref name="Midlife"/&gt; Married parents have that option to split the workload, even though it usually does not happen, but single parents do not have the option of sharing the workload with anyone.

The double burden is usually viewed as a primary problem for single women or married women. However, it is often less recognized that men can and often do go through the same trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; Within the book ''The Canadian Family in Crisis'', Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler. Eichler says, "[[Social science]] fails to understand men" by tending "to downplay or ignore a potential conflict between work and home for men."&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; Married men can avoid the full impact of the double burden, but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; Though single fathers face the same number of problems that single mothers face, they have two advantages that play in their favor.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; However, until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house, men still must deal with the [[Human sexuality|sexual]] and [[emotional]] frustration as a woman does.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; They must deal with the balancing of work, childcare, and domestic responsibilities.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; Single fathers are usually doubtful about their ability be a parent, and they are challenged psychologically.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; "The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all working parents. He has to change the way he feels about himself as man."&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden can and will interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired from their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much of a burden for them to balance both work and the family.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; With that being said, single fathers feel the same, if not more, of the effect of the double burden as women do.

The double burden that single mothers endure has a historical precedent, and still exists currently. Single mothers usually have higher rates of employment and children at home, and have the highest levels overall of the double burden. Women also typically have less economic resources than men, and have no partner to share the workload with them.&lt;ref name="Midlife"/&gt; Single mothers fall heavily under economic vulnerability. They may face job discrimination and not earn as much, so there will be further difficulties in maintaining the double burden. Single-mother families tend to hover near the [[poverty line]], with a poverty rate that is twice as high of that for men.&lt;ref name="Midlife"/&gt;

====Married parent double burdens====
The double burden also presents itself in households with married parents. Households with two parents may only have one working parent providing the majority of domestic activities.

Because of women's expanded roles in the workforce have generally not been accompanied by any relaxation of expectations for their family and domestic activities, many women today face the double burden of home and work responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Worlds Apart"/&gt; Many women take on the largest portion of the domestic obligations of the home, even when they are working full-time jobs.&lt;ref name="Worlds Apart"/&gt; This breeds anger and frustration, as these women know they do the majority of the housework on top of their careers.&lt;ref name="Worlds Apart"/&gt; There have been said to be more reasons, other than [[gender roles]], as to why there is a difference in the housework performed by men and women.&lt;ref name="Worlds Apart"/&gt; Some theories have suggested that women's expectations for household cleanliness are higher than men's.&lt;ref name="Worlds Apart"/&gt; Women feel like they must be responsible for the condition of the home in a way that men do not.&lt;ref name="Worlds Apart"/&gt; Men do invest most of their time in their careers, but women spend double that time caring for the children, state of the home and taking care of the domestic responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Worlds Apart"/&gt; In a graph from the [[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in 2004, that compare the workload of married men and women between the ages of 25-54, women are displayed as performing one hundred percent more housework than men, and men are displayed as having more leisure time than women.&lt;ref name="Worlds Apart"/&gt; As the double burden increased in 1980, women became more critical of their marriages than men and wanted the men to do more around the house to ease the burden of a "second shift". The double burden of women who have jobs and still shoulder the majority of the housework at home leads to women filing or initiating divorce.&lt;ref name="Triumph"/&gt;

This concept of the double burden with married couples is a worldwide [[phenomenon]]. Throughout different cultures of the world, women spend more total hours in work than men do. In Japan, once married, they are still expected to be devoted wives and mothers who give all off their effort to the home, even after a full day of work.&lt;ref name="Worlds Apart"/&gt; Latin American women, now entering the work force in large numbers, still face what they call ''doble jornada'', or double day's journey.&lt;ref name="Worlds Apart"/&gt; Although in the [[Latin American]] culture, men are starting to interact more with the children and helping around the house more, the main domestic responsibilities still fall upon the women of the house.&lt;ref name="Worlds Apart"/&gt; Sometimes women who are primary wage earners are still relegated to most of the domestic work.&lt;ref name="Worlds Apart"/&gt; European men are more likely to play and interact with their children but not likely to participate fully in their daily care.&lt;ref name="Worlds Apart"/&gt; They are more likely to help their wives at home, yet rarely do they tackle all domestic task equally.&lt;ref name="Worlds Apart"/&gt; Men commonly fail to live up to their belief of equal sharing of [[domestic labor]]: they may believe in an equal workload in the house, but the inconvenience of taking on work done by their wives stops many from following through.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt;

Also, domestic labor ("housework") has been traditionally defined as "welfare" related activities, such as cooking and cleaning. However, married men generally contribute more to household and material maintenance, construction, and repair activities that are not usually captured under domestic obligations.{{citationneeded|date=July 2018}}

===Middle-class vs. poor families===

====Middle-class families====
Middle-class families often use substitutes for domestic work to make up for the lost time while working in the paid sector. They buy time taking care of children by using hired help and [[Day care|day-care centers]]. They also decrease the burden of paid work and unpaid work by using household appliances such as [[microwaves]], [[laundry machine]]s, and [[dishwashers]], as well as buying pre-made food, eating out and using laundry services.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Poor families====
Poor families are much more constrained in their economic ability to "buy back" lost time through the market. Instead of buying market substitutes, they try to meet their needs without spending money by taking care of children instead of hiring help, taking care of the sick instead of taking them to the hospital, and making food from scratch instead of buying pre-made food. The way that poor families deal with the time debt is for the main [[Caretaker manager|caretaker]] to intensify the time that they spend working, by doing multiple jobs at once instead of doing one job at a time. When people increase the intensity of their work to compensate for their lack of time to finish everything that needs to get done, called [[Work Intensity|work intensity]], many health problems occur.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Effects==

===Health effects===

====Stress====
When faced with the double burden of having to deal with the responsibilities of both a career as well as domestic duties, sometimes a person's health is affected. Many people faced with these circumstances have a higher chance of being sick since health and stress seem to be correlated, as stress has been implicated in up to eighty percent of all illnesses, as found by a report done by the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family"/&gt; In an article that was written by a team of researchers it was found that both men and women faced with a "spillover" of work and family issues were 1.5-1.6 times more likely to have an absence due to sickness than others.&lt;ref name="Paid and Domestic"/&gt; Men and women in these situations have also been proven to be more likely to be faced with [[psychological stress]] and even see themselves as unhealthier than their colleagues who are not in their situation.&lt;ref name="Paid and Domestic"/&gt;

Although women faced with double burden usually have more stress than most women in today's society, it was proven that in most cases they are psychologically healthier than women who are not faced with these circumstances, for either being a stay at home mother or for being a working woman without children to take care of.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family" /&gt;

====Mortality rate====
In a study done by Rosamund Weatherall, Heather Joshi and Susan Macran of the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] in 1994, the research presented suggests that women presented with the double burden have a lower mortality rate than women who are simply housewives.&lt;ref name="Double burden or double blessing?" /&gt; The women who were observed that had part-time jobs had a mortality rate lower than the women with full-time jobs and children.&lt;ref name="Double burden or double blessing?" /&gt; The same study also suggests that women who have young children are less likely to die than women who have no children or have older children.&lt;ref name="Double burden or double blessing?" /&gt; Although this evidence can not be strictly attributed to the double burden of having children and a career field, it can give a good indication of a trend in society. Also, this study was conducted in multiple countries including England, Wales, and the United States which gives the information presented from the study a more global perspective on the double burden.

====Absences due to sickness====
In several Western countries it has been seen that absences due to sickness for women are far greater than men.&lt;ref name="The Double" /&gt; When investigating the reasons behind this, a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found that half of the difference between genders can be dismissed if you take out the days missed by pregnant women.&lt;ref name="The Double" /&gt; When taking into account the health effects of double burden, child birth is always a possibility for mothers who already are faced with taking care of children and having a career and effects them and their health. In many studies people have tried to relate the difference in sickness absences directly to the double burden effect. It has been somewhat successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick days than men in the same situation.&lt;ref name="The Double" /&gt; Additionally, working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family" /&gt;

====Loss of sleep====
The stress of maintaining a career and a household can also lead to a loss of [[sleep]].&lt;ref name="Paid and Domestic" /&gt; In traditional gender roles it is usually the mother who is the one to get the family going in the morning as she fixes breakfast and takes the children to school before she goes to her own job.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family" /&gt; At night the mother cooks and does various other activities around the house that cause her to be the last person to retire for the night as well. Although this is merely just a few gender roles that are not set in stone, they may hold to be true. It was found that working women sleep twenty-five minutes less a night due solely to their responsibility for domestic work.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Family" /&gt; Applying this statistic in larger scale leads to the assumption that women on average lose up to thirteen hours of sleep per month due to domestic duties. It can be assumed that it is possible for an average woman to lose up to one hundred and fifty-six hours of sleep during a year because of domestic work and motherly duties.

====Work intensity====
{{Main|Work Intensity|l1=work intensity}}

For many poor women and men whose work hours have reached the point where they cannot cut back on leisure time anymore to make time for domestic and paid work, work intensity is an issue because they often intensify their work time by doing two or more activities at once, such as taking care of children while cooking. Work intensity can lead to many negative health consequences, such as lack of [[sleep]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]], and lack of [[recreation]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Economic effects===
There are many economic effects to the person who has to shoulder the double burden. Oftentimes, this tends to be the woman in the relationship, and so there has been analysis done on the economic effect of the double burden on women. According to Himmelweit (2002), because women often earn less than men, there is the thought that the woman should be the one to fit her paid job around household activities such as taking care of children. Because of this, and because they have many domestic duties, women often take part-time jobs and jobs in the informal sector in order to balance paid work with domestic work.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Part-time jobs and jobs in the informal sector do earn less than full-time jobs, so men have to increase their paid work hours in order to compensate for the lacking family income. This will "weaken her earning power and strengthen his", leading to an unequal distribution of power in the [[household]], and allow the man to exploit the woman's unpaid work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ferguson (2010). Feminist Perspectives on Class and Work, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. ''Retrieved from: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-class/&lt;/ref&gt; This situation could have negative consequences especially for the woman because she is perceived to have less contribution to the household, due to domestic work being seen as less of a contribution than paid work. Such negative consequences include the lack of a [[divorce]] threat, where the woman does not have the economic means to ask for a divorce because she does not have a full-time job, and she has less money that she personally receives, decreasing her perceived contributions to the household.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Solutions==

===Family-friendly initiatives===
Family-friendly initiatives are a possible solution to redistributing the load of unpaid work and alleviating the double burden. Possible initiatives include flexible [[work hours]]; [[Part-time job|part-time]] and job-sharing options; parental leave; child care subsidies; and on-site daycare options. There are two primary approaches to assisting working families: "One stresses the importance of action from within, with emphasis on private, internal, local initiatives within firms and organizations to alter workplace norms, conventions, and practices. The other approach calls for government interventions designed to facilitate proper care for children with less sacrifice of parents' job opportunities, advancement, and compensation".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Government initiatives===
The [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] countries exemplify the use of family-friendly initiatives. For example, a nine-month parental leave is divided into thirds in [[Iceland]]. Three months are for the mother. Three non-transferable months are for the father, and there are three months that both parents can share. "The reimbursement is 80 per cent of the salary. From 2001 to October 2003, the average number of days taken by men increased from 39 to 83, and 13 per cent of Icelandic fathers used more than their non-transferable part."&lt;ref name="2009 World Survey" /&gt; Dual-income families are becoming the norm, especially in industrialized countries, so it is not uncommon for large corporations to practice some form of family-friendly initiative.

[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 000509-A-1601C-002.jpg|thumb|Child care facility]]

Government family-friendly initiatives such as child subsidies and cheaper child care facilities can also greatly decrease the gender difference in the workplace, due to the woman being able to work longer hours outside the home.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition, when developing policies related to paid work, it is important to do gender impact assessments in order to assess the impact of a policy on both the paid and unpaid sector.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Workplace initiatives ===
Whenever there is talk about new [[policies]] regarding new work time policies, there is often the argument for longer [[work hours]] in exchange for a shorter work week. For example, many are in favor of longer work hours such as "three ten-hour days or four eight-hour days".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, this is often not the best work hours for people who take care of children, because children go to [[school]] for perhaps six hours a day, not eight or ten. [[Caregiver|Caretakers]] would prefer the opposite - shorter hours and longer weeks, such as six hour work days for six times a week, with limits on evening work and [[overtime]], as well as flexible schedules. In order to lessen the burden of taking care of children and domestic duties as well as working in the paid sector, workplaces should consider policies that take into account the preferred work hours of caretakers. In addition, it is often the case now that many workers juggle domestic work and paid work. In order to get the most effective workers, companies should consider changing their policies in order to attract the best people in the field.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
A paper rejecting statistics of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions as "the main source of
tendentious polemics on women’s unfair burden and gender inequality", states that the idea of a double burden is a myth and conclude instead that "on average, women and men across Europe do the same total number of productive work hours, once paid jobs and unpaid household work are added together – roughly eight hours a day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hakim|first1=Catherine|title=(How) can social policy and fiscal policy recognise unpaid family work?|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2010/08/CatherineHakimRenewal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Hideo Ohkubo'''|大久保 秀夫|Ōkubo Hideo|born 1954}} is the founder, chairman, and president of [[Tokyo]]-based Forval Corporation.

==Education and early career==
Ohkubo was born in Tokyo. He graduated from the Law department of [[Kokugakuin University]]. He worked at both traditional Japanese large-scaled corporations and the foreign-oriented full-commission based companies and saw the advantages and disadvantages over each other. He thus got the idea to undertake the creation of a company with the advantages of both types of companies.

==Forval's founding==
He founded {{nihongo|Nippon Kouhan|日本工販}} in 1980. Within a year of its founding, it had already become Japan's top [[Business telephone system|business telephone]] leasing company.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-19/business/fi-3656_1_japanese-firm|periodical=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1986-12-19|accessdate=2010-07-12|title=N.Y. Firm Opens a Bridge to Japan|last=Matsubara|first=Katsumi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 his company went public on JASDAQ, becoming the youngest company in history to do so. That same year he won the "Young Entrepreneur of the Year" Award from the New Business Convention.

In 2000 Forval Telecom made its first public offering on the Mothers board of the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]]. In 2001 Forval Creative made a public offering on [[NASDAQ Japan]] (now the Hercules market of the [[Osaka Securities Exchange]]).

==Other activities==
Ohkubo supports financing and various arrangements that have encouraged past Forval employees and business partners to create their own successful companies, some of which have since gone public. He also works with the Forval Foundation, which sponsors the "Stradivarius Scholarship" to grant the winner of a violinist competition the free use of the foundation's [[Stradivarius]] violin for 2 years.

He is a leadership committee member of the [[Tokyo Chamber of Commerce]], vice-committee chairman of Advancement of New Industry, and vice-chairman of the New Business Convention.

'''Hilary Teague''' (1802 &amp;ndash; May 21, 1853), sometimes written as '''Hilary Teage''', was an [[Americo-Liberian]] merchant, journalist, and politician in the early years of the West African nation of [[Liberia]]. A native of the US state of [[Virginia]], he was known for his oratory skills and he pushed for Liberian independence from the [[American Colonization Society]].

==Business career==
Cartes' father was the owner of a [[Cessna]] aircraft franchise holding company and the young Horacio studied aviation mechanics in the [[United States]]. At the age of 19, he started a currency exchange business which grew into the [[Banco Amambay]]. Over the following years, Cartes bought or helped establish 25 companies including [[Tabesa]], the country's biggest cigarette manufacturer, and a major fruit juice bottling company.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Citation |title=Profile: Horacio Cartes |publisher=BBC News |date=22 April 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-22247484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Cartes spent 60 days in jail during a currency fraud investigation. He was accused of making millions of dollars on a central bank loan obtained at a preferential exchange rate and then moving it through his money exchange business before buying farm equipment in the U.S. The case was eventually dropped.&lt;ref name='Servin01'&gt;{{cite news | first = Pedro | last = Servin |author2=Michael Warren | title = Paraguay's new president woos foreign investment | date = 15 August 2013 | url = http://www.chron.com/news/crime/article/Paraguay-s-new-president-was-targeted-by-the-DEA-4734005.php | work = [[Houston Chronicle]] | accessdate = 17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartes was imprisoned on charges of currency fraud for seven months in 1989. He was eventually cleared by a court.&lt;ref name=Conservative/&gt;

In 2000, the anti-drug police seized a plane carrying cocaine and marijuana on his ranch. He claimed that the plane had made an emergency landing, that he had no involvement with the drug trade and that he opposed the legalization of narcotics.&lt;ref name =Conservative&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/world/americas/horacio-cartes-wins-paraguays-presidential-election.html?_r=0 |title=Conservative Tobacco Magnate Wins Presidential Race in Paraguay |first=Simon |last=Romero |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
Until 2008 Cartes was uninvolved in politics and he was not registered as a voter.&lt;ref name="brecha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brecha.com.uy/index.php/mundo/1728-el-buen-olfato-de-horacio-cartes |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505175930/http://brecha.com.uy/index.php/mundo/1728-el-buen-olfato-de-horacio-cartes |archive-date=5 May 2013 |title=Cartes' "good nose" for winning an election |date=26 April 2013 |publisher=Brecha |language=es |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the center-right Colorado Party in 2009 and said he wanted to counter the swing to the left in Latin American politics. He became known as an efficient politician uncompromised by his party's past support of the military dictatorship of [[Alfredo Stroessner]] who ruled until 1989.&lt;ref name="brecha"/&gt;

In regards to allegation of his connections to the drug trade, as well as being targeted by the [[DEA]],&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; he said during his presidential campaign: "I wouldn't want to be president if I had ties to drug traffickers. Go to the courts and check. There's nothing, not a single charge against me."&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

==President of Paraguay==
===Election===
Cartes was the Colorado candidate in the [[Paraguayan general election, 2013|2013 presidential election]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brecha"/&gt; The BBC suggested that his convincing points during his campaign were the promises to raise private capital to upgrade the country's infrastructure, to modernise its public enterprises, to attract international investments, and to create jobs. On 21 April 2013, he was elected President of Paraguay with 45.80% of the vote.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;  When he took office on 15 August, it marked only the second time in the country's 202 years of independence that a ruling party peacefully surrendered power to the opposition.

In regards to the [[impeachment of Fernando Lugo]] and the hostile reception the country was given in the aftermath by Latin American leaders, Cartes said that the country should not withdraw from [[Mercosur]] due to its economic benefits of free trade: "Paraguay in no way should abandon Mercosur...we have to hold on tight while they bash us a little bit and keep low and don’t play to being giants or annoyed. Mercosur is a common market like is Europe and with our neighbours we also have many coincidences. [In a globalised world] all countries are interconnected and it is out of the questions trying to isolate Paraguay from other countries. The [[Organization of American States|OAS]] has already began to understand our politics, that we’re a sovereign country, all was done according to the book and the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2012/07/13/paraguayan-presidential-hopeful-said-the-country-should-in-no-way-abandon-mercosur |title=Paraguayan presidential hopeful said the country should in no way abandon Mercosur — MercoPress |publisher=En.mercopress.com |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon being sworn in he said: "I'm not in politics to make a career of it or become wealthier. I'm in politics to serve my people, make the future better for new generations and build up our identity as a free, independent and sovereign people."&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/paraguays-president-targeted-dea-19965694 |title=International News &amp;#124; World News - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His inauguration was attended by fellow conservative South American, Chilean President [[Sebastián Piñera]] who said: "I want to say to President Horacio Cartes that we are very expectant about his future achievements. The slogan of his campaign was 'new directions,' and every country needs new directions and to be confronted with new challenges...the challenge of integration in our Latin America is still a pending challenge and the experience of the [[Pacific Alliance]] was a great experience which has been very fruitful." Other leaders at his inauguration were Argentina's [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], Peru's [[Ollanta Humala]],&lt;ref name="cjile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilovechile.cl/2013/08/16/chilean-president-piera-visits-paraguay-inauguration-president-horacio-cartes/89881 |title=Piñera visits Paraguay: Inauguration of President |publisher=Ilovechile.cl |date=16 August 2013 |accessdate=2 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822125938/http://www.ilovechile.cl/2013/08/16/chilean-president-piera-visits-paraguay-inauguration-president-horacio-cartes/89881 |archivedate=22 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil's [[Dilma Rousseff]], Uruguay's [[José Mujica]] and Taiwan's [[Ma Ying-jeou]].&lt;ref name="arg"/&gt;

===Cabinet===
Cartes said of his cabinet that the future ministers have the "enormous responsibility" of honouring those who voted for them and gave them a governing mandate. "It will be the beginning of a story that us Paraguayans want, a government for all, an inclusive government, our great obligation is with the citizens...we need all the Paraguayans to help us, to orientate us."&lt;ref name="arg"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.argentinaindependent.com/currentaffairs/newsfromlatinamerica/paraguay-president-elect-horacio-cartes-announces-cabinet/ |title=Paraguay: President-Elect Horacio Cartes Announces Cabinet - The Argentina Independent &amp;#124; The Argentina Independent |publisher=Argentinaindependent.com |date=13 August 2013 |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of them have an overwhelmingly technical profile:&lt;ref name="técnicos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americaeconomia.com/politica-sociedad/politica/horacio-cartes-apuesta-por-un-gabinete-de-tecnicos-en-paraguay |title= Technocrat cabinet in Paraguay |date=14 August 2013 |publisher=América Economía|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===
On May 21, 2018, the Paraguayan embassy moved to [[Jerusalem]], becoming the third country in the world to recognize the city as the diplomatic capital of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.euronews.com/2018/05/21/paraguay-moves-embassy-to-jerusalem|title=Paraguay moves embassy to Jerusalem|last=|first=|date=2018-05-21|work=Euronews|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cartes's successor [[Mario Abdo Benítez]] reversed the decision on September 5, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/05/paraguay-jerusalem-embassy-moves-to-tel-aviv|title=Outcry from Israel after Paraguay moves its Jerusalem embassy back to Tel Aviv|last=|first=|date=2018-09-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation attempt===
On 22 April 2018, Cartes was elected to a full [[Senate of Paraguay|Senate]] seat, which he ran for in hopes of extending his political influence past his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Servin |first=Pedro |publisher=Star Tribune |title=Paraguay president withdraws resignation and Senate bid |accessdate=June 26, 2018 |url=http://www.startribune.com/paraguay-president-withdraws-resignation-and-senate-bid/486587181/}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Senators would be sworn in on 30 June 2018, six weeks before Cartes's presidential term was scheduled to end, thus the need for Cartes to leave office before the expiration of his term, as the constitution states officials can not hold two offices concurrently. Consequently, on 28 May 2018, Cartes offered his resignation as President, which would have to be agreed to by [[Congress of Paraguay|Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Aporrea |title=(VIDEO) Renunció presidente de Paraguay Horacio Cartes |accessdate=June 26, 2018 |url=https://www.aporrea.org/internacionales/n325762.html |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislators were opposed to Cartes resigning and taking up the seat, stating it was unconsitutional. Opposition leaders were successful in blocking Cartes's resignation by boycotting the vote and not allowing a quorum to be present to vote on the resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Telesur |title=Paraguay: Opposition to Boycott Vote on Cartes's Resignation |accessdate=June 26, 2018 |url=https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Paraguay-Opposition-Boycotts-Session-on-Cartess-Resignation-20180529-0021.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartes withdrew his bid to resign and be sworn in as a senator on 26 June 2018 after not receiving enough political support to carry through his plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Chron |title=Presidente paraguayo Horacio Cartes retira su renuncia |accessdate=June 26, 2018 |language=Spanish |url=https://www.chron.com/espanol/news/article/Presidente-paraguayo-Horacio-Cartes-retira-su-13027039.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial statements==
Leading to the 2013 presidential election, Cartes made controversial statements on the LGBT community, comparing it to "monkeys". He also said he would "shoot myself in the bollocks" if he were to discover a son who wanted to marry another man.&lt;ref name=next/&gt;

On 10 August 2018, when asked by a journalist about his response to a series of citizen protests on [[Yacyretá Dam]] deals and congressmen with pending criminal cases, Cartes responded "[[Rubber bullet]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cartes: “Balines de goma” |trans-title=Cartes: “Rubber bullets” |url=http://www.abc.com.py/nacionales/balines-de-goma-para-estudiantes-1729689.html |newspaper=[[ABC Color]] |language=Spanish |date=10 August 2018 |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cartes sobre manifestantes: "Balines de goma" |trans-title=Cartes on protesters: "Rubber bullets" |url=https://www.ultimahora.com/cartes-manifestantes-balines-goma-n2700843.html |newspaper=[[Última Hora (Paraguay)|Última Hora]] |language=Spanish |date=10 August 2018 |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartes later apologized for the remark, stating, "I want to express my apologies to the young people for the published expressions. I always encouraged them to express themselves and my goal is the peace of all Paraguayans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=¿Horacio Cartes no asume su exabrupto? |trans-title=Horacio Cartes does not assume his outburst? |url=http://www.abc.com.py/nacionales/al-final-cartes-pidio-disculpas-1729700.html |newspaper=[[ABC Color]] |language=Spanish |date=10 August 2018 |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cartes se disculpa por sugerir "balines de goma" contra secundarios |trans-title=Cartes apologizes for suggesting "rubber bullets" against high school students |url=https://www.ultimahora.com/cartes-se-disculpa-sugerir-balines-goma-contra-secundarios-n2700850.html |newspaper=[[Última Hora (Paraguay)|Última Hora]] |language=Spanish |date=10 August 2018 |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ignjat Granitz''' (born '''Ignatz Granitz'''; 1845 &amp;ndash; 17 December 1908) was a [[Croatian people|Croatian]] [[Jew]]ish industrialist, philanthropist and publisher.&lt;ref name="žz"&gt;{{harvtxt|Snješka Knežević|2011|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
[[File:Granitz house.JPG|thumb|Granitz house]]
Granitz was born in [[Kemenesmagasi]], [[Hungary]], to a poor peasant Jewish family. In 1864, Granitz finished [[teacher training college]] in [[Győr]]. He attended rabbinical school in [[Bratislava]], but soon quit the education because of his liberal views. Granitz worked as a teacher in [[Sárvár]], and later in [[Nagykanizsa]]. In Nagykanizsa he meet his future wife Paula ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Deutsch), with whom he moved to [[Zagreb]] in 1869. In 1870, Granitz married Paula, and together they had four daughters, Olga, Zlata, Štefanija and Janka. Olga and Zlata later married two Jewish brothers, Ernest and Rikard Schulz. 

"Granitz house" was a three story house which was built for the Granitz family in 1886 by architect [[Hermann Bollé]]. Granitz and his family were philanthropists as they often aided poor and needy, organizing charity fundraisers. He was an active member of the Israelites Zagreb community.&lt;ref name="hakol"&gt;{{hr icon}} Ha-Kol (Glasilo Židovske zajednice u Hrvatskoj); Snješka Knežević; Ignjat Granitz i (srušena) kuća Granitz; stranica 28; broj 111, listopad / rujan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Granitz died on 17 December 1908 in Zagreb and was buried at the [[Mirogoj Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Gradska groblja Zagreb: Ignjat Granitz, Mirogoj Ž-1-I-52&lt;/ref&gt; His wife died in 1917.

The Granitz family lived in the "Granitz house" until the [[Nazi]] occupation of Zagreb and [[Independent State of Croatia]] establishment in 1941. Independent State of Croatia regime seized all the assets of the Granitz family, including their house. His daughter Olga ([[Married and maiden names|married]] Schulz) was killed on the street amid Zagreb by unknown [[Ustaše|Ustaša]]. Second daughter Zlata ([[Married and maiden names|married]] Schulz) killed herself when [[Gestapo]] came for her. Third daughter Štefanija survived the war hiding in [[Netherlands]], and fourth daughter Janka ([[Married and maiden names|married]] [[Slavko Wolf|Wolf]]) was arrested by Ustaše and later freed by her son, Pavao Vuk-Pavlović, former students. Granitz's grandchildren, sons in law and most family members had been killed during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. After the war, in the newly established [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]], Granitz properties were not returned to the surviving members of his family.&lt;ref name="ždvp"&gt;{{harvtxt|Milan Polić|2001|pp=13–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In Zagreb, where he moved from Hungary, Granitz meet his future business partner Lavoslav Hartman. At first, Granitz was employed at Hartman printing office, and in 1878 they established the joint company "Hartman &amp; Granitz". After Hartmans death, Granitz and his new business partner, Vilim Schwartz, paid out the Hartman widow, and in 1882 they formed the new company called "Ignjat Granitz &amp; Comp.". Skillfully using social connections and trading skills, Granitz rapidly expanded his business with new and modern printing machines. In 1883, "Ignjat Granitz &amp; Comp." became the first Croatian printer of school books in the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]]. "Ignjat Granitz &amp; Comp." also published "Agramer Zeitung", newspapers on German published from 1848 to 1912. Granitz was among the founders of the paper factory "Zagrebačka tvornica papira" in 1895, member of the "Croatian-Slavonian commercial bank", member of the "Commercial Chamber" and one of founding members of the "Industrialists Union" of Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. Later in life, he was named the honorary life Vice President of the "Industrialists Union". He was also the member of the [[Freemasonry]] lodge "Ljubav bližnjemu" and the city representative in the Zagreb City Assembly. Granitz was close friend of known Croatian painter and politician, [[Izidor Kršnjavi]]. After his death, "Ignjat Granitz &amp; Comp." was merged with the printing house of Ivan Novak, to found the Graphic and Publishing Bureau "Tipografija d.d." which published the papers "Jutarnji list", "Večer", "Obzor" and "Svijet". In 1959, "Tipografija d.d." was merged with "Narodni list", to found the newspaper house "[[Vjesnik]]".&lt;ref name="ždvp"/&gt;

'''The Lok Ma Chau Loop Innovation and Technology Park''' ({{zh|t=落馬洲河套地區}}) is a proposed new hi-tech development at the border between [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shenzhen]], [[China]]. It is located in Hong Kong's [[New Territories]] near the area of [[Lok Ma Chau]], on the [[Sham Chun River]].

The development of the park was announced on 3 January 2017 during a joint ceremony by the governments of Hong Kong and Shenzhen. When completed, it will be the largest technology business park in Hong Kong with a size of 87 hectares and is expected to boost the area's global position in technology and provide an incubator for technology start-ups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.gov.hk/en/categories/admin/html/2017/01/20170103_165616.shtml|title=Deal signed for HK-SZ tech park|website=Hong Kong's Information Services Department|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|2}}
== Details ==
Until the 1990s, the Lok Ma Chau loop was part of [[mainland China]]. When some engineering work was done to straighten the winding Sham Chun River, the natural border moved north and effectively left the land mass of the loop only accessible from Hong Kong. Dispute of ownership of the land continued until recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20140714-hk-shenzhen-locked-in-territorial-dispute-over-lok-ma-chau-loop/|title=HK, Shenzhen locked in territorial dispute over Lok Ma Chau Loop|date=2014-07-14|newspaper=EJ Insight|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the agreement of the technology park, the land dispute has been settled.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2058878/hong-kong-and-shenzhen-set-partner-innovation-and-technology|title=Hong Kong and Shenzhen settle border dispute as they join hands to develop technology park|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Once developed, the park is expected to provide 1.2 million square metres of additional office space to be used by Hong Kong and Shenzhen companies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The park is expected to be managed by [[Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation|Hong Kong Science and Technology Park Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hkstp.org/hkstp_web/en/corporate-news-science-park-company-news/latest-news?Alias=hkstp-welcomes-the-development-of-the-lok-ma-chau-loop-into-a-hong-kongshenzhen-innovation-and-technology-park|title=HKSTP welcomes the development of the Lok Ma Chau Loop into a “Hong Kong/Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park”|website=www.hkstp.org|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Criticism ==

=== Environmental ===
The proposed park is located in a current green land area, a buffer zone between the urban agglomerations of Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Environmental groups claim the park is located in an important flightpath for [[Bird migration|migratory birds]]. The wetlands form an ecosystem that continues west along Sham Chun River and the development may thus affect [[Deep Bay, China|Deep Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/01/04/new-lok-ma-chau-loop-tech-development-plan-ecological-disaster-green-group-warns/|title=New Lok Ma Chau Loop tech development plan an ecological 'disaster', green group warns|date=2017-01-04|website=Hong Kong Free Press|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hong Kong Wetland Park|Hong Kong wetland park]] and the [[Mai Po Marshes]] are also along this route. The groups estimate the loss of 4,000 trees, 11 hectares of [[Marsh|reed marsh]] and 9 hectares of ponds.

In addition, it is thought that the current marsh land site contains significant amounts of contaminated mud which may pose an environmental risk and a challenge to decontaminate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2135566/tale-murkiness-lok-ma-chau-loop|title=The tale of murkiness that is the Lok Ma Chau Loop|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rationale ===

Hong Kong has two existing high profile business and technology parks, [[Cyberport]] on [[Hong Kong Island]] and [[Hong Kong Science Park|Science Park]], also in the New Territories. Both were conceived in the wake of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|1997 Asia financial crisis]] in order to boost technology investments, but their uptake has been slow and is only just starting to come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/article/1556997/just-how-useful-have-cyberport-and-science-park-been|title=Hong Kong's white elephants? Jury still out on Cyberport and Science Park|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially Cyberport has been marred with image problems, starting from its delayed development to lacking in commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=30 July 2013|url=http://www.scmp.com/business/article/1292929/cyberport-still-joke-10-years-later?page=all|title=Cyberport is still a joke 10 years later|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lok Ma Chau loop has been claimed to be at risk of repeating some of the Cyberport experience by being yet another government run development on the green field with poor transport links while there is ample existing office space in and around Hong Kong which may be suitable for start-ups in a more economical and more relevant way in a world of virtual collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2060351/lok-ma-chau-loop-cyberport-fiasco-all-over-again|title=The Lok Ma Chau Loop is the Cyberport fiasco all over again|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some local business groups welcome the technology park, but are mindful that lessons are learned from previous developments and that there should be all effort for a speedy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2059192/lok-ma-chau-loop-tech-park-attract-more-hong-kong-firms|title=Shenzhen start-ups fear slow work on Lok Ma Chau Loop tech park|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions have been raised whether the true ambition of the government is to support the technology industry, or to obtain land for profitable real estate development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2060266/lok-ma-chau-loop-has-nothing-do-hi-tech-its-all-about-profit|title=Lok Ma Chau Loop has nothing to do with hi-tech – it’s all about profit|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, September 2013, Boidman expressed his views regarding the intersection between DOOH and other sectors like healthcare, radio and TV, transit, cinema and retail: 
:"There’s been a lot of talk about consolidation, but I really think that we are at the point where 2014 will see it happen," 
:"In 2014, we see synergies in putting together companies in various sectors: in transit, in healthcare, and in entertainment – which includes restaurants and theaters, too. Consolidation opens the door to different types of advertisers for many companies that are currently too small to attract them. It increases the number of eyeballs, and more eyeballs interest advertisers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; a quarterly publication by Platt Retail Institute, LLC. an international consulting and research firm that focuses on the use of technology to impact the customer experience. In this article, he addresses the role of new technology in delivering more capable and cost-effective DOOH media platforms to bridge the digital/mobile commerce gap. An example of these platforms is the public transportation network with digital signage included in taxis, public transit buses, and trains, where innovations in the application of DOOH emerge as transit authorities advance their usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In May 2015, Boidman was one of seven featured speakers at the 2015 OAAA-TAB National Convention + Expo in San Diego, alongside the author, [[Malcolm Gladwell]]. Boidman made specific recommendations to the attendees, including using technology to demonstrate ROI of OOH advertising, and creating an open structure data management platform that would involve using data to target audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Smart city initiatives could represent a $1.5 trillion opportunity for the decade preceding 2015 for software and hardware companies, according to Boidman.
:"Cisco and IBM have been focused on this space for a while, but they haven’t wanted to talk about it. Now they want to talk about it, and a lot of that has to do with Smart Cities," said Boidman."If you can use these solutions to help make out-of-home smarter, then more dollars should flow to digital out-of-home media." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Mobile and beacon technologies transform OOH media, enabling advertisers to engage consumers on the go.

&lt;/ref&gt; OOH smart billboards feature beacons and other devices that help track travel patterns, behavior and other information of interest to advertisers. These billboards tap into the data on mobile phones of passersby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In Boidman’s opinion, "In the world of online, they can track you with cookies, they know where you’ve been and where you’re going next. It’s almost the same thing in real life." "From a privacy standpoint, people are willing to give up information about themselves, as long as it’s aggregated and anonymous," he says.  "They’re very comfortable [doing so] in order to get valuable information in return that’s going to help them. Our view is it’s the same thing online. Some people find it okay that they’re being tracked and certain targeted ads head their way." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the impact that such developments as [[Heterogeneous System Architecture]] (HSA) and [[OpenCL]], Boidman argues: "Everybody is looking for software to do more and for less money, and technologies such as HSA and OpenCL make it easier to design low-power devices and improve performance for the designer, the [designer’s OEM] customer and the user. Writing programs across platform solutions that allow people to connect seamlessly with digital signage is the future." And advocates for the use of the term intelligent visual communications rather than digital signage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4167">The '''North American Securities Administrators Association''' ('''NASAA'''), founded in [[Kansas]] in 1919, is the oldest international investor protection organization.  NASAA is an association of state securities administrators who are charged with the responsibility to protect consumers who purchase [[securities]] or investment advice. NASAA's membership consists of 67 administrators from the territories, districts, and states of the [[United States]], from [[Mexico]], and from the provinces of [[Canada]].

In the United States, NASAA is the voice of state securities agencies responsible for efficient capital formation and grassroots investor protection.  NASAA's fundamental mission is protecting consumers who purchase securities or investment advice, and its jurisdiction extends to a wide variety of issuers and intermediaries who offer and sell securities to the public.

Through the association, NASAA members participate in multi-state enforcement actions and [[information sharing]].  NASAA also coordinates and implements training programs and education seminars for state, district, provincial, and territorial securities agency staff.  The [[Uniform Securities Agent State Law Exam]] is written by NASAA and administered by FINRA.

Representative of the nature of its activities are its frequent warnings regarding [[investment fraud]],&lt;ref&gt;http://investmentexecutive.com/client/en/News/DetailNews.asp?Id=42356&amp;cat=8&amp;IdSection=8&amp;PageMem=&amp;nbNews=&amp;IdPub=&lt;/ref&gt; its focus on the [[tax advantage]]s of college plans,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2007/12/09/business/chamberlin/19_22_4012_8_07.txt&lt;/ref&gt; and its involvement in [[naked short selling]] litigation aimed at the [[Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasaa.org/content/Files/ShortSalesComment.37990-38287.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

NASAA also provides a coordinated review process for companies using [[Regulation A]] of the [[Securities Act of 1933]] to raise capital.

'''Parmanand Singh''' (born 1905) was one of the three [[Indo-Fijians]] elected to the [[Legislative Council of Fiji|Legislative Council]] of [[Fiji]] in October 1929 when Indo-Fijians were given the first opportunity to elect their own representatives. The other two were [[Vishnu Deo]] and [[James Ramchandar Rao]]. Singh was a landlord from Ba and undertook several business ventures which included publishing newspapers.

==Biography==
Parmanand Singh was born in [[Yalalevu]] in the [[Ba District, Fiji|Ba District]] of Fiji in 1905. His parents had come to Fiji as [[Indian indenture system|indentured labourer]]s and prospered in the opportunities available after indenture. He was educated at [[Auckland]] College, graduating in 1923. While in [[New Zealand]], he played rugby, a game rarely played by Fiji Indians.

On his return to Fiji, he took advantage of a business opportunity by leasing land from [[Colonial Sugar Refining Company (Fiji)|Colonial Sugar Refining Company]] (CSR) and sub-leasing it to small farmers.

Like most rich farmers from Ba, he joined the [[Arya Samaj in Fiji|Arya Samaj]] and was chosen by [[Vishnu Deo]] to contest the Northern &amp; Western Division in the [[1929 Fijian general election|1929 general elections]], the first in which Indo-Fijians were allowed to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fijielections.blogspot.com/2017/02/fiji-legislative-council-election-1929.html 1929 Fiji Legislative Council elections] Fiji Elections&lt;/ref&gt; He won easily with the support of Deo and the Arya Samaj, an organisation to which most educated Fiji Indians belonged. However, two weeks after being sworn in he and the two other Indo-Fijians representatives resigned when a motion asking for equal political rights for Indo-Fijians was defeated.

He was opposed to the immigration of [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]s and [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]s, a cause later taken up by his brother, [[Chattur Singh]] who was later also a member of the Legislative Council.

In 1948, he left for [[India]] for the education of his children and returned 3 years later.

He saw opportunities in the printing industry and established a printing press in [[Ba (town)|Ba]], which he used to publish a newspaper, ''Awaaz'' (The Voice) in the [[Hindi]] language. He was unable to keep the newspaper in circulation due to a natural disaster and poor staff. He then moved to [[Lautoka]] and in 1956, started publishing another newspaper, ''Jai Fiji'', which remained in circulation until 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Sharma | first = Guru Dayal | title = Memories of Fiji: 1887 - 1987 | publisher =Guru Dayal Sharma, Suva, Fiji | year = 1987 | pages = 151–152 | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family involvement in Fijian politics has continued with his son, [[Anand Singh]], also serving in the [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]] and [[Senate of Fiji|Senate]] and as the [[Attorney General of Fiji]] in the [[Fiji Labour Party]] government of [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] from 1999 to 2000.

'''Piotr Antoni Steinkeller''', (English: ''Peter Steinkeller''), born 15 February 1799 in [[Kraków]], died 11 February 1854 in Kraków, was a Polish entrepreneur, banker and pioneering industrialist. He was known as the "King of Zinc" and opened the ''London Zinc Works'' in [[Hoxton]] in 1837.

==Life==
He was the son of Józefina, née Frey and Piotr Steinkeller descended from [[Pomerania]]n [[Szlachta|nobility]]. The family being of Roman Catholic observance, migrated to the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] at the time of the [[Reformation]], and later moved to [[Vienna]]. In mid 18th century, Steinkeller's grandfather arrived in Kraków to open a wholesale business in spices. The family business carried on into the next generation, headed by the following Piotr, who died prematurely in 1813, leaving a widow with 5 children. At that stage Piotr Antoni was sent to Vienna to study international trade and to do an internship in banking. He returned to Kraków in 1818 and took over the management of the family business.

From the start he evinced great energy and inventiveness. He proceeded to make local investments in [[Freie Stadt Krakau|Kraków Free State]]. In 1822 he bought a mining concession near [[Jaworzno]], where he built a coal mine and a [[zinc smelting]] factory that he named "Józefina" after his mother. It became the scene of his broad range of economic interests as he proved himself a pioneer in the industrial field. He made contracts for an uninterrupted supply of raw materials from the [[open-cast]] zinc mine in [[Długoszyn]] and leased further zinc ore deposits in [[Byczyna]]. He established a state-of-the-art [[Zinc]] production-line that employed around 80 people. He was a social innovator in relation to his work-force: he brought in signed work contracts outlining the rights and obligations of both parties and provided accommodation for the workers. For that purpose he erected an estate for his employees - this became the foundation of today's {{ill|Niedzieliska (Jaworzno)|pl|lt=Niedzieliska}} district. He also initiated a scheme to build a miners' hospital in Jaworzno and equipped the first industrial [[Fire service]] in the area.

==Expansion in Warsaw==
In 1825 Steinkeller resolved to sell the Niedzieliski business and move to [[Warsaw]], where he settled permanently. There he continued his pioneering economic involvement in several fields. He opened a large [[Department store]], imported salt from [[England]], invested in mining and [[Steel production]] in [[Dąbrowa Górnicza]], where exploration of deep mining had just begun at [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]]. He established a [[Brickworks]] in [[Pomiechówek]] and bought a steam-driven mill in [[Solec, Warsaw|Solec]] in Warsaw. He expanded his zinc interests into large-scale production by leasing government owned tin mines and smelting facilities in [[Congress Poland]]. He also imported zinc from the Kraków area, controlled then by [[Habsburg Austria]]. Whereas in [[London england|London]] he set up a zinc works to produce galvanised sheeting and from there he developed an international trade in the metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| editor = ed.

In 1838 he set up a [[Courier service]] whose network covered virtually all the main tracts in the Russian-controlled [[Kingdom of Poland]] and outlying areas, using specialist courier carriages he produced at his Solec depot, known as „steinkellerki" - Steinkeller's [[Diligence]]”. He supplemented these with a river courier service. Until the opening of the [[Warsaw-Vienna railway]] of which he was one of the early backers and investors, his messenger network was the chief source of his revenues.

Thanks to his efforts, on [[Nowy Świat Street]], the main commercial thoroughfare in Warsaw, the road was laid out in timber blocks. He acquired a vast country estate near [[Częstochowa]], in an area known as ''dominium żareckie'' or "Żarki domain", including the town of [[Żarki]], and villages like: [[Jaroszów, Silesian Voivodeship|Jaroszów]], Zawada, Leśniów, Przewodziszowice, [[Jaworznik]], Ciszówka, [[Myszków]], [[Nowa Wieś, Gmina Dąbrowa Zielona|Nowa Wieś]] and Warcianna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author = Durka, Jarosław|title = Kariera i upadek Piotra Antoniego Steinkellera (1799-1854) |journal = Poznańskie Zeszyty Humanistyczne |date = 2009 |issn = 1732-1174 |volume = 13 |place = Poznań |pages = 43–49 |url = https://www.academia.edu/15438612/Kariera_i_upadek_Piotra_Antoniego_Steinkellera_1799-1854_}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he brought in modern agricultural techniques in raising crops and [[animal husbandry]]. He also opened a factory to produce agricultural machinery.

He was also an active investor and financier. Among his roles were consultant to [[Bank Polski]], where he worked closely with [[Henryk Łubieński]], and was a senior consultant to the [[Warsaw Stock Exchange]]. The registered office of his business was in the Mniszchów Palace in Warsaw, that had been refurbished for the Warsaw [[Chamber of commerce]] (Warszawska Resursa Kupiecka), of which Steinkeller was an active member.

However, not all of Steinkeller's initiatives were crowned with success. This was due largely to problems of a technical nature.
Faith in foreign specialists was sometimes misplaced. Examples of this were his over-reliance on them in the restoration of [[Mining|lead mine]]s in [[Olkusz]], or in the production of [[Farm equipment]], or importing river barges from England whose draught was inappropriate for Polish waterways. His own financial situation took a turn for the worse towards the end of the 1840s. His indebtedness to Bank Polski, a new management (Łubieński and president Lubowidzki had been removed on charges of [[Malfeasance|malfeasance]]) at the bank and a fire at his Solec works led to his being declared bankrupt in 1849. All his assets in Congress Poland were taken over by Bank Polski. He returned "over the border" to Kraków, where he still owned assets like his brickworks and a roof-tile factory in [[Podgórze]]. Not long after he died of a cardiac arrest.

==Personal life==
Steinkeller was twice married: firstly, to Aniela Anthonin, and secondly to Maria Lemańska. From his first marriage there were four sons and a daughter, Józef, Alfred, Aleksander, Edward and Paulina. There was one son from the second marriage, Henryk Artur. Steinkeller's nephew by his sister, was [[Józef Hauke-Bosak]].

==Honours==
[[File:Steinkeller tablica.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque to Steinkeller in St Peter and Paul church, [[Warsaw]]]]
Among his contemporaries he was greatly admired and carried great authority. His appeal to colleagues can be summed up as follows: "aside from his astonishing energy and his enormous zest for industry, he had a solid and honest respect for industry itself, not as a pretext for speculation, not as an asset stripper, but looking out for organic growth for the benefit of the country as a whole." He was awarded;

* The [[Order of Saint Stanislaus]] III class 1839
* The [[Order of St. Anna]] III class 1842

On the 50th anniversary of his death in 1904 a commemorative plaque to Steinkeller was placed in St Peter and Paul church, [[Warsaw]] with the inscription: ''To a deserving Polish industrial pioneer, from his grateful countrymen.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1865">A '''product defect''' is any characteristic of a product which hinders its usability for the purpose for which it was designed and manufactured. 

==Definition==
Product defects arise most prominently in legal contexts, where the term is applied to "anything that renders the product not reasonably safe".&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;Patricia A. Robinson, ''Writing and Designing Manuals and Warnings'' (2009), p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The field of law that addresses injuries caused by defective products is called [[products liability]].

A wide range of circumstances can render a product defective. The product may have a '''design defect''', resulting from the product having been poorly designed or tested, so that the design itself yields a product that can not perform its desired function. Even if the design is correct, the product may have a '''manufacturing defect''' if it was incorrectly manufactured, for example if the wrong materials are used. A product may also be considered legally defective if it lacks appropriate instructions for its use, or appropriate warnings of dangers accompanying normal use or misuse of the product.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

A product that is defective in some way that does not render it dangerous might still be sold, with a [[discounts and allowances|discounted]] price reflecting the defect. For example, where a clothing manufacturer discovers that a line of shirts have been made with slightly uneven sleeves, the manufacturer may choose to sell these shirts at a discount, often through at [[outlet store]] and with the [[Label#Textile labeling|label]] cut off to indicate that the quality is not intended to reflect on the brand.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Ruppel Shell, ''Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proto.in''' is an Indian start-up event platform which had its first edition in January 2007. The platform was started by [[Chennai]] based not-for profit body The Knowledge Foundation with entrepreneur Vijay Anand as its curator and founder. The Knowledge Foundation is a not-for profit knowledge dissemination body which has had multiple events in Chennai including Blog Camp, Bar Camp, Wikicamp (inaugurated by [[Jimmy Wales]]) and Pod Works.&lt;ref&gt;http://specials.rediff.com/money/2007/jan/19proto.htm  Source: Rediff.com, {{cite web |url=http://www.proto.in/proto2007se/files/Proto.in_Trends_ITMag.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122111448/http://www.proto.in/proto2007se/files/Proto.in_Trends_ITMag.pdf |archivedate=2011-11-22 |df= }} Source: IT Magazine

&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its first event in Jan 2007, Proto.in has had 8 editions across the cities of Chennai, [[New Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Bangalore]] and [[Pune]]. 
The sole focus and objective of the event is to showcase 15 of the most innovative start-ups in the country and provide them with a platform in front of an audience of [[investor]]s, [[entrepreneur]]s and customers alike.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Proto was a key event in the [[India Startup Ecosystem TimeLine]], bringing a critical mass of media, investors, customers, and technologists together for the first time.

==Event Format==

The event format is centered around the 'Showcase'. This is where 15 start-ups take the stage one by one and demo their products for 6 minutes each. The start-ups are generally slotted into categories - some of the popular ones in the previous editions of Proto.in have been [[Internet]], [[Software]], Mobile and Outliers which generally contains start-ups from a myriad set of sectors.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event Locations==

The event has been held in 7 different locations across the 5 cities of Chennai, New Delhi, Bangalore, Pune and Mumbai. It's always had a very strong link with the Academic community.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

In the past Proto.in has received criticism for backing only hi-tech product start-ups with a big focus only on web and [[social media]]. This perception has changed substantially over its last 3 editions with a deeper focus, they now have a more transparent nomination process. Over the last few editions the focus has also shifted to start-ups in categories like [[social enterprise]]s, with a strong focus on technology enabled social enterprises.

There has also been criticism in terms of the Rs.10,000 nomination fee. Start-ups have found that its a high price to pay, they also believe that there is a conflict when a start-up is first selected and then made to make a payment.

Proto.in's defence has always been the same - they would like to have a start-up to have skin in the game and take the event seriously. Unlike other events, Proto.in is the only one where start-ups are provided free boarding, lodging and a stall. In Proto.in's opinion, the actual cost it incurs per start-up is Rs.50,000.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Rowan Gormley''' (born 8 June 1962) is a [[South African]] born entrepreneur. He was appointed Group [[CEO]] of Majestic Wine PLC after the acquisition of Naked Wines in April 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/WINE/12310972.html|title=Acquisition, CEO appointment and Trading Update - RNS - London Stock Exchange|website=www.londonstockexchange.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gormley studied at Selborne College, [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]] and the [[University of Cape Town]]. He trained as an accountant with [[Arthur Andersen]] in South Africa for three years before moving to the United Kingdom in 1987 to work in venture capital for Electra Capital Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/my-biggest-mistake-oh-dell-why-did-i-listen-to-them-1119157.html|title=My Biggest Mistake: Oh Dell, why did I listen to them? |last= Thackray |first= Rachelle|date=15 September 1999|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Gormley was in private equity for seven years before going to work for [[Richard Branson]] in 1994. Branson brought him to Virgin to identify new business opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Branson |first= Richard |title= [[Losing My Virginity]] |publisher= [[Virgin Publishing]] |year= 1998 |isbn= 1-85227-684-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he spotted financial services as a potential area for Virgin to explore, Branson asked Gormley to run it, and Virgin Direct (now [[Virgin Money]]) was born in 1995 with Gormley as [[CEO]].

Whilst at Virgin Direct, Gormley was also behind the launch of [[The One Account]], now a part of [[Royal Bank of Scotland]].

After leaving Virgin Money, he launched three new start-ups. His first was Orgasmic Wines, with the help of his business partner Laura Knight and his brother Clinton Gormley. The firm became [[Virgin Wines]] in 2000 when Richard Branson bought into the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.edp24.co.uk/content/aspx/2007/Power100/71_80.aspx |title=EDP Power 100, 2007 |date=19 June 2007 |publisher=EDP |accessdate=2009-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213221320/http://business.edp24.co.uk/content/aspx/2007/Power100/71_80.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laithwaites subsequently bought Virgin Wines, and Gormley left the company in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpers.co.uk/news/news-headlines/5952-virgin-wines-founder-%22removed-from-post%22.html| title=Virgin Wines founder "removed from post"| date=4 July 2008|publisher=Harpers|accessdate=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naked Wines==
Gormley set up [[Naked Wines]] in December 2008 with eight of the old [[Virgin Wines]] team.

'''Sir Thomas Farmer''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|CVO|CBE|KC*SG|FRSE|DL|sep=,}} (born 10 July 1940) is a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] entrepreneur.

One of seven siblings in a devoutly Catholic family, in 1964 Farmer founded his own tyre retailing business which he sold in 1969 for £450,000. Farmer retired to the United States, but became bored and decided to find a new challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgu.ac.uk/news/disp_NewsPreview.cfm?PGE_ID=32714&amp;vmenu=2 "Kwik-Fit founder shares his knowledge at RGU"]&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Edinburgh to found the [[Kwik Fit]] chain of garages in 1971. The firm grew quickly, mainly through acquisition, including opening in the Netherlands in 1975. Farmer was named Scottish Businessman of the Year in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mad.co.uk/Main/Regions/Scotland/Articlex/f453fee9f56d4a3294ddf8072a4bdce3/Kwik-Fit-founder-named-Scotland%E2%80%99s-top-businessman.html "Kwik Fit founder named Scotland's top businessman"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entrepreneurial-exchange.co.uk/defaultpage1231cef0.aspx?pageID=728 The Entrepreneurial Exchange]&lt;/ref&gt; After building the chain to become the world's largest independent tyre and automotive repair specialists with over 2,000 centres operating in 18 different countries, Farmer sold the firm to [[Ford]] in 1999 for more than £1 billion. He is the first Scot to be awarded the prestigious [[Andrew Carnegie]] Medal for philanthropy.

In 2006, he donated [[GBP|£]]100,000 to the [[Scottish National Party]] to help fund their campaign for the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2007|2007 Scottish Parliament general election]]. Farmer commented at the time that it was not an indication of his political allegiance but that he wanted the SNP to be able to compete financially with their better-funded political opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir Tom donates £100,000 to SNP|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5416494.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=7 October 2006|accessdate=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmer repeated his endorsement for the SNP in the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2011|2011 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/scotland/Scottish-Election-2011-KwikFit-founder.6760527.jp|work=[[Scotland on Sunday]]|title=Scottish Election 2011: Kwik-Fit founder backs SNP|date=1 May 2011|accessdate=2 May 2011|first=Eddie |last=Barnes|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmer was made a [[Knight Commander with Star of the Order of St. Gregory the Great]], a high honour that the Catholic Church can bestow on a layman. He was also [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]] in 1997. He is a supporter of the international development charity [[Mary's meals]].
 
Farmer owned 90% of [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], a professional [[association football|football]] club based in Edinburgh in 2003.&lt;ref name = "hibs inv"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sport.scotsman.com/hibernianfc/Hibs-reveal-depth-of-Farmers.2447717.jp|title=Hibs reveal depth of Farmer's investment|first=David|last=Hardie|work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]]|date=29 July 2003|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He invested nearly £3 million to rescue the club from receivership and he continued to fund developments of [[Easter Road]] and financial losses made by the club.&lt;ref name = "hibs inv"/&gt; Before his intervention, the club had been threatened during 1990 by an attempted takeover by [[Wallace Mercer]], the owner of their [[Edinburgh derby]] rivals [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article1144477.ece|title=Sleeping with the enemy|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|first=Simon|last=Buckland|date=22 June 2003|accessdate=2 May 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmer has admitted that he has no great love of football, and he rarely attends matches.&lt;ref name = "attendance"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/6089742.stm|title=Farmer content with Hibs backseat 				|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=26 October 2006|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt it was important to the local community that Hibs should continue to exist, as he was informed by campaigners that his grandfather had saved the club from bankruptcy approximately 100 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Lugton, A. (1999) Ch. 14 'Down but not Out: 1891–1893'. In 'The Making of Hibernian Vol. I' (pp. 189–204). John Donald Publishers Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; Farmer delegated control of Hibs to other figures, such as [[Rod Petrie]].&lt;ref name = "attendance"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/4094791.stm|title=Petrie takes over as Hibs chair|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=14 December 2004|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/3225299.stm|title=Farmer backs ground decision|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=29 October 2003|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmer lives in [[Edinburgh]], with his wife of 43 years, Anne. They have one daughter, one son and four grandchildren. Farmer also owns the island of [[Inchkeith]] in the [[Firth of Forth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/410323/UK-DAVIDSON-INTERVIEW---TOM-FARMER/|website=Management Today|accessdate=14 April 2015|title=UK: THE DAVIDSON INTERVIEW - TOM FARMER.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 after [[Queen Margaret University]] in Edinburgh was awarded full university status, he was named as founding Chancellor having been associated with the institution for several years.

Farmer was appointed [[Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] (CVO) in the 2009 New Year Honours for his work as chairman of the Board of Trustees of the [[Duke of Edinburgh's Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=58929|date=31 December 2008|page=3|supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trello''' is a [[Web application|web-based]] [[Project management software|project management application]] originally  made by [[Fog Creek Software]] in 2011, that was spun out to form the basis of a separate company in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Special Announcement: Trello is now part of Trello, Inc.|url=http://blog.trello.com/trello-is-now-trello-inc/|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later sold to [[Atlassian]] in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.trello.com/trello-atlassian|title=Trello Is Being Acquired By Atlassian|first=Michael|last=Pryor|publisher=|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is based in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=ForbesNYCStartups2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaprive/2016/03/23/the-10-hottest-startups-in-nyc/2/#7e9c7d417bed|title=10 Hot Startups In NYC|accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Trello was released at a [[TechCrunch]] event by Fog Creek founder [[Joel Spolsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/13/joel-spolskys-trello-is-a-simple-workflow-and-list-manager-for-groups/ |title=Joel Spolsky's Trello Is A Simple Workflow And List Manager For Groups |first=Leena |last=Rao |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine named the application in September 2011 one of "The 7 Coolest Startups You Haven't Heard of Yet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/09/startups-techcrunch-disrupt/ |title=The 7 Coolest Startups You Haven't Heard of Yet |publisher=Wired.com |date=September 16, 2011 |accessdate=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lifehacker]] said "it makes project collaboration simple and kind of enjoyable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5839942/trello-makes-project-collaboration-simple-and-kind-of-fun |title=Lifehacker Trello Review |publisher=Lifehacker.com |date= |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, it raised $10.3 million in funding from [[Index Ventures]] and [[Spark Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/07/24/digital-whiteboard-trello-spins-out-of-fog-creek-with-10-3m/|title = Digital Whiteboard Trello Spins Out of Fog Creek With $10.3M |date=July 24, 2014 |accessdate= |website = |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |last=Gage |first=Deborah }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Trello launched third-party integrations with tools such as Slack, GitHub and Salesforce for its paying users. In 2016, Trello opened this platform to additional developers with the launch of its "Power-Ups Platform" for developers wanting to integrate their services with Trello.&lt;ref&gt; Lardinois, Frederic (January 19, 2016). [https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/19/trello-launches-developer-platform/ "Trello Launches Developer Platform"]. ''TechCrunch''. AOL.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Trello claimed it had more than 1.1 million daily active users and 14 million total signups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2016/05/23/trello-get-serious-about-big-businesses-as-it-passes-1-1-million-daily-users-and-triples-sales/#5683f3376ce2|accessdate = |title=Trello Get Serious About Big Businesses As It Passes 1.1 Million Daily Users And Triples Sales |website=[[Forbes]] |date=May 23, 2016|last=Konrad |first=Alex }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2017, [[Atlassian]] announced its intent to acquire Trello for $425 million. The transaction was made with $360 million in cash, while the remaining $65 million was made with shares and options. Trello had earlier sold 22% of its shares to other investors with the remaining majority held by founders Michael Pryor and [[Joel Spolsky]] at the time of acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/atlassian-acquires-trello/ |title=Atlassian acquires Trello for $425M |last=Lardinois |first=Frederic |work=TechCrunch |publisher=AOL |date=January 9, 2017 |accessdate=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2017/01/09/productivity-app-trello-sold-for-425-million.html|title=Productivity app Trello sold for $425 million|publisher=New York Business Journal|date=January 9, 2017|last=Noto|first=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Trello has a variety of work and personal uses including real estate management, software project management, school bulletin boards, lesson planning, accounting, web design, gaming and law office case management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leanpub.com/trellodojo |title=Trello Dojo |first=Daniel |last=Root |date=February 9, 2014 |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rich API as well as email-in capability enables integration with enterprise systems, or with cloud-based integration services like [[IFTTT]] and [[Zapier]].

== Architecture ==
According to a Fog Creek blog post in January 2012, the client was an extremely thin web layer which downloads the main app, written in [[CoffeeScript]] and compiled to [[minified]] JavaScript, using [[Backbone.js]]&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web |title=Trello|url=http://backbonejs.org/#examples}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HTML5]] &lt;code&gt;[[pushState|.pushState()]]&lt;/code&gt; and the [[Mustache (template system)|Mustache]] [[templating language]].&lt;ref name="Trello, Stack" &gt;{{cite web|title=The Trello Tech Stack|url=http://blog.fogcreek.com/the-trello-tech-stack/|first=Brett |last=Kiefer| date=January 19, 2012| accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The server side was built on top of [[MongoDB]], [[Node.js]] and a modified version of [[Socket.io]].&lt;ref name="Trello, Stack" /&gt;

== Reception ==
On January 26, 2017, ''PC Magazine'' gave Trello a 3.5 / 5, calling it "flexible" and saying that "you can get rather creative," while noting that "it may require some experimentation to figure out how to best use it for your team and the workload you manage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2487001,00.asp|title=Trello|website=PCMAG|language=en|access-date=February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Viktor Felixovich Vekselberg''' ({{lang-ru|Виктор Феликсович Вексельберг}}, {{lang-uk|Віктор Феліксович Вексельберг}}; born 14 April 1957) is a Ukrainian-born Russian businessman. He is the owner and president of [[Renova Group]], a large Russian conglomerate. According to ''[[Forbes]]'', his fortune is estimated at $13.6 billion, making him the fourth richest person in Russia, as of August 4, 2015.&lt;ref name=ForbesBillionaires&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/viktor-vekselberg/ Forbes: The World's Billionaires - Viktor Vekselberg] March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Victor Vekselberg was born in 1957 to a [[Ukrainian-Jewish]] father and a [[Russians|Russian]] mother&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120917180209/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46146832.html Der Spiegel: "Im Westen wartet keiner auf mich" by Walter Von Mayr and Gerhard Spörl] March 6, 2006 (''in German'') | ''"Der alltägliche Antisemitismus ist nicht zu leugnen. Ich habe ihn selbst häufig zu spüren bekommen, obwohl ich unter Juden nicht als Jude gelte, da meine Mutter Russin ist. Die Russen wiederum halten mich nicht für einen Russen, weil mein Vater Jude ist"'' - ''"The everyday anti-Semitism is undeniable. I myself often get to feel it, even though I don't count as a Jew among the Jews, as my mother is Russian. The Russians in turn do not think I'm a Russian because my father is a Jew."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianRicherTheyCome&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/02/russia.lukeharding1 The Guardian: "The richer they come ...Can Russia's oligarchs keep their billions - and their freedom?"

==Career==
In 1988, after the [[Gorbachev]] administration relaxed restrictions on private business as part of his new policy [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]], he founded NPO Komvek which did work for the Irkutsk Aluminum Plant&lt;ref name=BlockbusterRussia /&gt; and in 1990, he co-founded [[Renova Group]] with college classmate,&lt;ref name=BlockbusterRussia /&gt; [[Leonard Blavatnik]].&lt;ref name=RussiaProfile&gt;[http://russiaprofile.org/bg_people/resources_whoiswho_alphabet_v_vekselberg.html Russia Profile: "VEKSELBERG, Victor Feliksovich"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824210730/http://russiaprofile.org/bg_people/resources_whoiswho_alphabet_v_vekselberg.html |date=August 24, 2013 }} retrieved August 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; KomVek owned 67% of Renova and Blavatnik’s company [[Access Industries]] owned the remainder.&lt;ref name=RussiaProfile /&gt; He benefited financially from the privatization of the [[Aluminium in Russia#Privatisation|aluminum industry in Russia]] under the [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin]] administration in 1993.&lt;ref name=BlockbusterRussia /&gt; In 1996, he co-founded the [[SUAL Group|Siberian-Urals Aluminium Company]] (SUAL) via a merger of the Ural and Irkutsk Aluminum Plants.&lt;ref name=RussiaProfile /&gt; (SUAL would later be incorporated into [[United Company RUSAL]], the largest aluminum company in the world). Using revenues generated from his aluminum business, he purchased a minority interest in Tyumen Oil (TNK), one of [[Russia]]'s largest oil and gas companies.&lt;ref name=JewishBusiness&gt;[http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2013/04/09/with-7-5-billion-in-his-pocket-viktor-vekselberg-to-increase-his-shareholdings-in-switzerland/ "With $7.5 billion in his pocket, Viktor Vekselberg to increase his shareholdings in Switzerland" By Stanley Green], [[Jewish Business News]], April 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yenikeyeff, Shamil, [http://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/BP-Russian-billionaires-and-the-Kremlin.pdf "BP, Russian billionaires, and the Kremlin: a Power Triangle that never was"], ''Oxford Energy Comment'', November 23, 2011. Retrieved 2011-11-24.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, he secured a controlling interest in Tyumen and was appointed to the Board of Directors; in 1998, he was appointed Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref name=RussiaProfile /&gt; Later, he integrated those and other assets under the umbrella of [[Renova Group]], delegating operating responsibilities to managers.

In 2003, the Renova Group, along with [[Access Industries]] (owned by [[Leonard Blavatnik]]) and the [[Alfa Group]] (owned by [[Mikhail Fridman]], [[German Khan]], and [[Alexei Kuzmichov]]) announced the creation of a strategic partnership to jointly hold their oil assets in Russia and Ukraine, forming the AAR consortium. In the same year, they merged AAR with [[British Petroleum]]'s Russian oil assets in a 50-50 joint venture named [[TNK-BP]], the largest private transaction in Russian history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/8516794/BP-in-Russia-a-timeline.html The Daily Telegraph: "BP in Russia: a timeline"] October 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Acting as a chairman of the executive board of TNK, Vekselberg was instrumental in negotiating and closing the transaction.

In 2010, Vekselberg was appointed President of the Skolkovo Foundation, a non-profit organization funded by a mix of private investors and the Russian government, with the goal of building a technology research hub in Russia.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://apnews.com/5e533f93afae4a4fa5c2f7fe80ad72ac/Sanctioned-Russian-oligarch-linked-to-Cohen-has-vast-US-ties |title=Sanctioned Russian oligarch linked to Cohen has vast US ties |publisher=[[The Associated Press]] |first=Garance |last=Burke |first2=Stephen |last2=Braun |date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its President, Vekselberg signed a deal for [[Cisco Systems]] to invest $1 billion over ten years into Skolkovo Foundation projects.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; The [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]] subsequently issued a statement claiming that the Skolkovo Foundation was being used by the Russian government to gain access to classified American technology.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

Vekselberg is now{{when|date=March 2017}} overseeing a vast restructuring of his assets: the division of property with the partner [[Leonard Blavatnik]], the merger of Renova's aluminum assets with those of [[Oleg Deripaska]], and the integration of various electricity and telecommunications investment.

==Art collection==
In February 2004, Vekselberg purchased nine [[Fabergé egg|Fabergé Imperial Easter eggs]] from the [[Forbes family (publishers)|Forbes publishing family]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, February 4, 2004: [https://www.forbes.com/2004/02/04/cx_pm_0204fabergesale.html Russian Tycoon Buys Forbes Faberge Eggs]&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was transported to Russia and exhibited in the [[Kremlin]] and in [[Dubrovnik]] in 2007. Vekselberg is the single largest owner of Fabergé eggs in the world, owning fifteen of them (nine Imperial, two Kelch, and four other Fabergé eggs). In a 2013 [[BBC Four]] documentary, Vekselberg revealed that he had spent just over $100 million purchasing the nine Fabergé Imperial eggs from the Forbes collection.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0336tf3  "The World's Most Beautiful Eggs: The Genius of Carl Faberge"] BBC FOUR&lt;/ref&gt; He claims never to have displayed them in his home, saying he bought them because they are important to Russian history and culture, and he believed them to be the best jewelry art in the world. In the same BBC documentary, Vekselberg revealed plans to open a museum to display the eggs in his collection.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; The result was the [[Fabergé Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia]], which had its official opening ceremony on November 19, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.fsv.ru/en/news/article/1 |title= The Fabergé Museum has officially opened in the Shuvalov Palace in St. Petersburg|publisher= Official website of the Link of Times Foundation |language= |accessdate = March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, Vekselberg agreed to pay approximately $1&amp;nbsp;million in expenses to transport the [[Lowell House]] Bells from [[Harvard University]] in the United States back to their original location in the [[Danilov Monastery]] and to purchase replacement bells. The historic bells returned to Moscow on September 12, 2008, with the assistance of the U.S. director of the organization, [[Edward Mermelstein]].

Vekselberg had paid £1.7 million at a [[Christie's]] auction in 2005 for ''Odalisque'', a nude said to be the work of Russian artist [[Boris Kustodiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.artnews.com/2013/02/05/did-the-court-make-a-mistake/ |title= High Court Drama |publisher= Art News |language= |accessdate = March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, soon after the purchase, experts working for Vekselberg's art fund, Aurora, began to cast doubt on the picture's authenticity. They claimed that Kustodiev's signature, dated 1919, was done in aluminium-based pigment not available until after the artist's death in 1927. Vekselberg sued Christie's, and the judge ruled in July 2012 that he was entitled to recover the £1.7 million that he paid for the painting, plus Christie's was ordered to pay around £1 million in costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/artsales/9432441/Russian-oligarch-wins-1.7m-refund-from-Christies-after-auction-house-sold-him-fake-painting.html |title= Russian oligarch wins £1.7m refund |publisher= www.telegraph.co.uk |language= |accessdate = March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charitable donations==
Vekselberg's firm Renova donated between $50,000 and $100,000 to the [[Clinton Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/investigators-follow-flow-money-trump-wealthy-donors-russian/story?id=50100024 Special counsel probing flow of Russian-American money to Trump political funds]". ABC News. September 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

He donated $4.5 million to the construction of the $50 million [[Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center]] in Moscow, and is the chairman of the museum's board of trustees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-08/peres-inaugurates-jewish-museum-funded-by-putin-vekselberg-1-.html Bloomberg: "Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center Peres Inaugurates Jewish Museum Funded by Putin, Vekselberg" By Ilya Arkhipov &amp; Henry Meyer] November 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax-religion.ru/?act=news&amp;div=52009 Vekselberg headed the board of trustees of the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center] Interfax, July 18, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He finances the restoration and construction of [[synagogue]]s in Russia, including the construction of the Choral Synagogue in Saratov.&lt;ref&gt;[http://izrus.co.il/oligarhi/article/2015-02-03/26797.html Вексельберг построит синагогу в Саратове] Izrus, 03/02/2015 13:55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He is married to Marina and has two children, a daughter and a son.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/23/rosneft-deal-viktor-vekselberg-russia-rich The Guardian: "Rosneft deal makes Viktor Vekselberg Russia's richest man" by Simon Goodley and Luke Harding] October 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; His father is Jewish, and his mother Christian. He identifies himself as multi-national and does not attend weekly synagogue or church services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesti7.ru/news?id=5147 Кого в России считать евреем?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310072218/http://www.vesti7.ru/news?id=5147 |date=March 10, 2014 }} Александр Рогаткин, Выпуск от 31.10.2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

* In April 2009, Swiss Federal Finance Department initiated a criminal investigation against Vekselberg in connection to alleged violations of securities law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/wirtschaft/aktuell/verfahren_vekselberg__1.2346394.html Strafverfahren gegen Vekselberg im Fall Sulzer]. 6.4.2009&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the investigation, Vekselberg was fined $38m by Swiss authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/business/20100201/157736410.html Russian tycoon fined $38M in Switzerland, set to appeal fine]. Sputnik News. 01-02-2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2008, Vekselberg proxied a deal between Russian and Hungarian governments, buying the former embassy building from Hungary for $21m and immediately selling it to the Russian government for $116m, while the market price of the building was estimated at $50m. Investigation of the paper trail by [[Alexey Navalny]] and the Rospil project has found several invalid and backdated documents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://navalny.livejournal.com/609880.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625133702/http://navalny.livejournal.com/609880.html |archivedate=June 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus suggesting a [[collusion]] (e.g. the tender held by the Hungarian side was totally fictive, as the building was already sold by that time). Hungarian officials responsible for the deal (Tátrai Miklós, Marta Horvathne Fekszi and Arpad Szekely) were detained in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/ceweekly/2011-02-16/hungary-detentions-linked-to-sale-property-moscow Hungary: detentions linked to the sale of property in Moscow].

Interfax. 8 августа 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 2018, members from [[Robert Mueller]]'s team of [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|special counsel investigators]] questioned Vekselberg at a New York area airport.&lt;ref name=NYT180504&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Goldman | first1 = Adam | last2 = Protess | first2 = Ben | last3 = Rashbaum | first3 = William K. | title = Viktor Vekselberg, Russian Billionaire, Was Questioned by Mueller’s Investigators | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/politics/viktor-vekselberg-mueller-investigation.html | newspaper = New York Times | date = May 4, 2018 | access-date = May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2018, the United States imposed sanctions on him and 23 other Russian nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20180406.aspx |title=Ukraine-/Russia-related Designations and Identification Update: OFAC Specially Designated Nationals List |author= |date=2018-04-06 |website=[[United States Department of the Treasury]] |publisher= |accessdate=2018-04-06 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://meduza.io/news/2018/04/06/ssha-vveli-sanktsii-protiv-36-rossiyskih-biznesmenov |title=США ввели санкции против семи российских олигархов и 17 чиновников из "кремлевского списка" |trans-title=The US imposed sanctions against seven Russian oligarchs and 17 officials from the "Kremlin list" |author= |date=2018-04-06 |website=[[Meduza]] |publisher= |accessdate=2018-04-06 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{why?|date=May 2018}}
