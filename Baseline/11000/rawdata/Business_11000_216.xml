The '''affinity diagram''' is a business tool used to organize ideas and data. It is one of the [[Seven Management and Planning Tools]]. People have been grouping data into groups based on natural relationships for thousands of years; however, the term affinity diagram was devised by [[Jiro Kawakita]] in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;Improving Performance Through Statistical Thinking By Galen C. Britz&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes referred to as the '''KJ Method'''.

The tool is commonly used within [[project management]] and allows large numbers of ideas stemming from [[brainstorming]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/affinity-diagram-kawakita-jiro-or-kj-method Affinity Diagram - Kawakita Jiro or KJ Method], Retrieved June 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; to be sorted into groups, based on their natural relationships, for review and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leanyourcompany.com/methods/Using-Affinity-Diagrams.asp Using Affinity Diagrams to make sense from brainstorming]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also frequently used in [[contextual inquiry]] as a way to organize notes and insights from field interviews. It can also be used for organizing other freeform comments, such as open-ended survey responses, support call logs, or other qualitative data.

==Process==
The affinity diagram organizes ideas with following steps:
# Record each idea on cards or notes.
# Look for ideas that seem to be related.
# Sort cards into groups until all cards have been used.

Once the cards have been sorted into groups the team may sort large clusters into subgroups for easier management and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Value: Its Measurement, Design and Management  By M. Larry Shillito&lt;/ref&gt;  Once completed, the affinity diagram may be used to create a [[Ishikawa diagram|cause and effect diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tin.nhs.uk/index.asp?pgid=1129 NHS Improvement network]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, the best results tend to be achieved when the activity is completed by a cross-functional team, including key stakeholders. The process requires becoming deeply immersed in the data, which has benefits beyond the tangible deliverables.

An '''agency agreement''' is a [[legal]] [[contract]] creating a [[fiduciary relationship]] whereby the first [[party]] ("the [[Principal (commercial law)|principal]]") agrees that the actions of a second party ("the [[agent (law)|agent]]") binds the principal to later agreements made by the agent as if the principal had himself personally made the later agreements.  The power of the agent to bind the principal is usually legally referred to as [[authority]].  [[agency (law)|Agency]] created via an [[Contract|agreement]] may be a form of [[implied authority]], such as when a person gives their credit card to a close relative, the cardholder may be required to pay for purchases made by the relative with their [[credit card]].

Many states employ the [[equal dignity rule]] whereby the agency agreement must be in writing if the later agreement would also necessarily be written, such as a contract to buy thousands of dollars' worth of goods.

An example of the existence of an agency agreement at issue in a 2006 court case arose when a tennis tournament sponsor sued [[Venus Williams|Venus]] and [[Serena Williams]] for not participating.  The sponsor argued that their father, [[Richard Williams (tennis coach)|Richard Williams]], had committed to their participation in the tournament.  The Williams sisters argued that their father did not have the authority to bind them to such an agreement.  If their father did commit the sisters to play, the issue for the court to decide is whether a valid agency agreement existed between the Williams sisters and their father.  If not, then they likely were not bound to his agreement under the [[law of agency]].{{Update after|2010|11}}

Manufacturers and suppliers of goods frequently appoint agents to act on their behalf in promoting sales, both in the home country of the manufacturer as well as overseas.  A formal agreement is usually signed setting out the commission the agent will receive, the territory, duration and other terms on which the principal and agent will do business together.

Within the [[European Union]], there is legislation designed to give some protection to agents, in particular the right to compensation in certain circumstances when an agency is terminated. The same applies in other parts of the world and in some countries it is necessary for a foreign manufacturer to appoint as agent an individual or company that is a national of the country where the agency will operate.

An agent should be distinguished from a distributor—in commercial parlance, a distributor will buy stock from the supplier or principal and then sell it on to his customers at a mark-up, whereas an agent will find customers for the principal who then sells direct to the customers and pays commission to the agent.

The '''Association of Old Crows''' is an international professional organization specializing in [[electronic warfare]], tactical information operations, and associated disciplines headquartered in [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. This nonprofit organization's mission is to "advocate the need for a strong defense capability emphasizing electronic warfare and information operations to government, industry, academia, and the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crows.org/about/mission-a-history.html|title=Mission &amp; History – Uncategorized – About|author=Bridgette Anderson|publisher=|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Old Crows" emerged from the first use of electronic warfare in [[World War II]] to disrupt [[Axis powers|Axis]] communications and radars. [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] equipment and operators were known by the code name "Raven". Common jargon changed the name to "Crows" and those engaged in the profession became known as "Old Crows".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalostate.edu/physics/x757.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928144251/http://www.buffalostate.edu/physics/x757.xml |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization draws expertise and information from its members, a pool of thousands of individuals including technology specialists and actual military personnel, and is involved in advancing electronic warfare and [[Intelligence assessment|information-gathering]] techniques, disseminating information on these topics, and supporting the education of personnel in related scientific matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crows.org/about/about-aoc.html|title=About AOC – Uncategorized – About|author=Bridgette Anderson|publisher=|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bolloré''' is a French transportation company headquartered in [[Puteaux]], on the western outskirts of [[Paris]], [[France]]. The company, a paper–energy–plantations–logistics conglomerate, employs 28,000 people around the world.

In 2004, the group ranked amongst the top 200 European companies. Whilst the company is listed on the [[Euronext]] exchange in [[Paris]], the Bolloré family retains majority control of the company through a complex and indirect holding structure.

The company is led by [[Vincent Bolloré]].

==History==
The firm was founded  in 1822, in [[Ergué-Gabéric]], near [[Quimper, Finistère|Quimper]], [[Brittany]] by Nicolas Le Marié (1797-1870), as a paper manufacturer named ''papeteries d'Odet''. Beginning in 1863, it was directed by Jean-René Bolloré (1818–1881), a nephew by marriage who had obtained a medical doctorate in 1863.

The firm remained owned by the Bolloré family. [[Gwenn-Aël Bolloré]] was Vice-President of the [[Papeteries Bolloré]] from 1952 to 1974. In late 2004 the Bolloré group began taking an interest in the advertising sector, and started building a stake in [[Havas]], becoming its single largest share-holder. In a [[boardroom coup]] Alain de Pouzilhac was deposed as President and [[CEO]] on July 12, 2005. The Bolloré stake in Havas stood at 26%, and the group had 3 seats on the Havas board as of June 2006. Vincent Bolloré's son [[Yannick Bolloré]] is now Havas' Chairman and CEO after the stepping down of its previous CEO in January 2014.

In 2005 Bolloré expanded its media interests by launching the television station [[Direct 8]]. The firm also began buying shares of the British [[media planning|media planning and buying]] group [[Aegis Group plc|Aegis]]. Bolloré sold its 26% stake to [[Dentsu]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/dentsu-aegis-bollore-idUSWEA645620120712| title = Bollore agrees to sell Aegis stake to Dentsu |date = 2012-07-02  | publisher = Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From June 6, 2006 to December 22, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/medias/2012/01/10/04002-20120110ARTFIG00390-la-pub-a-progresse-de-44-dans-la-presse-en-2011.php |title=La pub a progressé de 4,4 % dans la presse en 2011 |publisher=lefigaro.fr |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolloré launched a free evening newspaper [[Direct Soir]]. Lack of readers and advertising revenues made the group focus on its other free newspaper, "Direct Matin", launched in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategies.fr/etudes-tendances/dossiers/208421/207838W/presse-gratuite.html |title=Dossier presse gratuite |publisher=strategies.fr |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 2009, Bolloré held talks with Bolivian President [[Evo Morales]] about the use of its [[lithium]] reserves for [[electric vehicle]] batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actuen/articles/110/article_2926.asp |title=RFI - Be partners not predators, Morales warns French firms on Paris visit |publisher=Rfi.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolloré manufactures the [[Bolloré Bluecar]], a small electric car, initially produced to showcase the company's range of electric power cells. The Bluecar was introduced in December 2011 as part of the [[Autolib']] [[carsharing]] service in Paris.&lt;ref name=Launch1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainableguernsey.info/blog/2011/12/autolib-electric-car-sharing-service-launches-in-paris-france/|title=Autolib’ electric car sharing service launches in Paris, France|author=Richard Lord |publisher=Sustainable Guernsey|date=2011-12-05|accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bluecar deliveries to retail customers began in March 2012.&lt;ref name=AVEM0312&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avem.fr/news?id=2995|title=Bolloré Bluecar – 1000 immatriculations pour Autolib’ et début des livraisons pour les particuliers|trans-title=Bolloré Bluecar– 1000 cars registered for Autolib’ and deliveries for individuals begin|language=French|author=Michaël Torregrossa|publisher=AVEM|date=2012-03-07|accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Bollore increased its stake in Havas from 36 percent to around 83 percent through a public exchange offer of new Bollore shares for Havas stock. The company said at the time it would like to hold onto a stake well in excess of 50 percent. In March 2015, Bollore sold a 22.5 percent stake in the media group for a price of around €600 million. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=Reuters| date=26 March 2015| title=Bollore sells 22.5 percent Havas stake for $662 million | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/26/us-havas-bollore-stake-idUSKBN0ML22F20150326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next month, in April 2015, Bollore raised its stake in [[Vivendi]] from 10.2 percent to 12.01 percent at a total cost of €568 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=Reuters| date=2 April 2015| title= Bollore raises Vivendi stake again as AGM battle looms | url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/02/us-bollore-vivendi-idUSKBN0MT0OO20150402}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, it owns 20% of Vivendi (30% voting power), 60% of Havas and 9% of [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bollore.com/en-us/activities/portfolio-of-shareholdings|title=Portfolio of shareholdings - Bolloré|website=www.bollore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/global/vincent-bollore-ups-stake-voting-rights-in-vivendi-1201885211/|title=Vincent Bolloré Ups Stake, Voting Rights in Vivendi|first=Elsa|last=Keslassy|date=11 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are plans to integrate payment for the bike and car hire schemes with the ticketing systems for traditional modes of public transport. Two electric vehicle manufacturers are said to be in the frame to supply the cars: the  [[Dassault Group]] and Bolloré. The former has a vehicle called the [[Cleanova]], which  employs the body of the Renault Kangoo van, while Bolloré’s Bluecar has been developed with Italian styling house [[Pininfarina]] and is due to go on sale commercially in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/move-over-velib-autolib-is-on-its-way-17274 |title=Move Over Velib, Autolib Is On Its Way |publisher=BikeRadar |date=2008-06-30 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2009}}

'''Cardiff city centre''' ({{lang-cy|Canol Dinas Caerdydd}}) is the [[city centre]] and [[central business district]] of [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]]. The area is tightly bound by the [[River Taff]] to the west, the Civic Centre to the north and railway lines and two railway stations &amp;ndash; [[Cardiff Central railway station|Central]] and [[Cardiff Queen Street|Queen Street]] &amp;ndash; to the south and east respectively. Cardiff became a city in 1905.

The city centre in Cardiff consists of principal shopping streets: Queen Street, St. Mary's Street and the Hayes, as well as large [[shopping centre]]s, and [[List of shopping arcades in Cardiff|numerous arcades]] and lanes that house some smaller, specialized shops and boutiques.

The city centre has undergone a number of redevelopment projects, including [[St. David's Centre#St. David's 2|St. David's 2]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which extended the shopping district southwards, creating 100 new stores and a flagship [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]], the only branch in Wales and the largest outside [[London]]. Compared to nearby cities, the new St David's Centre has more retail space than the whole of [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] or [[Swansea]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In 2008&amp;ndash;9, the annual [[wikt:footfall|footfall]] of shoppers was 55 million, and is expected to have risen to 66 million by 2009&amp;ndash;10.{{update needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==History==

{{main|History of Cardiff}}
[[Image:John Speed's map of Cardiff 1610.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Speed]]'s 1610 map of Cardiff]]
Cardiff was granted city status by [[Edward VII]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/27849/pages/7248

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, planners described Cardiff city centre as "worn out, inconvenient, drab and dangerous". The centre had escaped the extensive wartime bomb damage inflicted on other cities, so little redevelopment took place in the 1950s and 1960s. The Buchanan Plan of 1964 envisaged a highly ambitious extended city centre, crossed with urban motorways. The council scrapped the proposed motorway network and focused on the small commercial core of the city; its proposed redevelopment scheme, in partnership with a private developer, would have seen almost all of the city centre (except St Mary Street and Working Street) demolished, replaced by [[Modern architecture|modernist]] office towers of up to 21 storeys and pedestrianised decks linking [[multi-storey car park|multi{{nbhyph}}storey car park]]s to covered shopping malls.&lt;ref name="Hooper"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the legal agreement to implement 'Centreplan 70' was signed, the 1973 property crash had made it unviable. However, one legacy of the scheme was the future segregation of office and retail development, with the west end of Newport Road as the principal office area with secondary concentrations on Churchill Way, Greyfriars Road and Westgate Street.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

Development in the 1970s and 80s was more piecemeal than envisaged in Centreplan, with the building of the St. David's Centre and St David's Hall, new multi{{nbhyph}}storey car parks, and the grant{{nbhyph}}supported construction of the 14{{nbhyph}}storey Holiday Inn (now the Marriott) and World Trade Centre (now the Cardiff International Arena), which gave a fillip to the city's conference and exhibition business. In the mid&amp;ndash;1980s developers returned to Queen Street, creating three medium{{nbhyph}}sized malls, helping it to become one of the best performing shopping streets in the country in terms of footfall and rental levels.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

In the 1990s the Mill Lane cafe quarter was developed in partnership with the [[Welsh Development Agency]], a pedestrian forecourt was created for the refurbished Central railway station, a new walkway was constructed alongside the Taff and the [[Millennium Stadium]] was built on the site of the [[Cardiff_Arms_Park#National_Stadium|National Stadium]] and [[Wales Empire Pool|Empire Pool]]. The latter became, according to official publicists, one of the icons of Cardiff's new image.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

==Castle Quarter==

The [[Castle Quarter]] includes some of [[List of shopping arcades in Cardiff|Cardiff's Victorian and Edwardian arcades]]: Castle Arcade, High Street Arcade and Duke Street Arcade, and principal shopping streets: [[St. Mary Street/High Street|St Mary Street, High Street]], Castle Street and Duke Street.

Development of the area began in February 2010 and is expected to be completed by July 2011. [[Cardiff Council]] says that work to create the Castle Quarter as a pedestrian friendly environment for High Street and St Mary Street is designed to enhance the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Castle Street/Duke Street/Kingsway===

[[File:Duke Street Arcade Cardiff.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Duke Street Arcade]]
'''Castle Street''' follows on from Cowbridge Road East from [[Canton, Cardiff|Canton]] and begins after Cardiff Bridge, over the [[River Taff]]. It becomes '''Duke Street''' after the junction with High Street before turning north and  becoming '''Kingsway''', leading to [[Cathays Park|Cardiff Civic Centre]]. From west to east, streets that begin from the southern side of this stretch are Westgate Street, Womanby Street, High Street (St Marys Street), St Johns Street (The Hayes), Queen Street and Greyfriars Road. [[Cardiff Castle]] and [[Bute Park]] dominate the northern side of the street. On the southern side are pubs, bars, retail and hotel units. Castle Arcade and Duke Street Arcades begin from this stretch.

===St. Mary Street and High Street===

{{main|St. Mary Street/High Street}}
[[Image:St. Mary Street, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|left|St. Mary Street south end]]
[[File:Womanby Street - Cardiff - geograph.org.uk - 1575663.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Womanby Street looking south]]
'''St. Mary Street''' ({{lang-cy|Heol Eglwys Fair}}) and '''High Street''' ({{lang-cy|Heol Fawr}}). The former street is named after the 11th century church of St. Mary, the largest in Cardiff until it was destroyed by the [[Bristol Channel floods, 1607|Bristol Channel floods]] of 1607. Today the stretch of road is the home of a number of [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s, [[night club]]s and [[restaurant]]s, as well as branches of many major [[bank]]s. Also fronting onto the street is [[Howells (department store)|Howells]] department store, which stretches from just after [[Cardiff Central Market]] to the corner of Wharton Street.  From August 2007 the street was closed to private vehicles, leaving only buses, cycles and taxis allowed to access the whole street.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The street is usually closed to all traffic every Friday and Saturday night to allow the efflux from [[night club]]s and [[pub]]s located in that part of the street to clear. It is also closed when major events take place such as at the [[Millennium Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Womanby Street===

Womanby Street is one of Cardiff's oldest streets. It is known for its small, independent live music venues and is home to [[Clwb Ifor Bach]]. It is accessed from Castle Street, between Westgate Street and High Street.

==Queen Street and vicinity==

[[File:Summer on Queen Street - Cardiff - geograph.org.uk - 1363923.jpg|thumb|left|Queen Street]]
'''Queen Street''' ({{lang-cy|Heol y Frenhines}}) is the main thoroughfare in the city, now wholly pedestrianised. Most of Queen Street, from the castle moat to Dumfries Place, used to be called '''Crockherbtown''' (Crockherbtown Lane can still be found off Park Place),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Street was pedestrianised in 1974 and is served by [[Cardiff Queen Street railway station]] on Station Terrace. It meets Dumfries Place/Newport Road at its eastern end, Duke Street/Castle Street at its western, and Park Place approximately halfway along. Further down Park Place is the [[New Theatre (Cardiff)|New Theatre]], a local landmark is Principality House, head office of the [[Principality Building Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the north running parallel is Greyfriars Road, referring to the site of an old monastery, a traditional office location that has recently seen conversion to bars, apartments and hotels as offices move to the new business parks on the edge of the city, or to the better connected southern end of the city centre.

==Cathays Park (Civic Centre)==
{{main|Cathays Park}}

[[File:Cathays Park, Cardiff.png|thumb|Cathays Park]]
Cathays Park is the [[civic centre]] of Cardiff. The [[Edwardian]] architecture of [[Cardiff City Hall]], [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum and Gallery of Wales]], [[Cardiff University]], [[Cardiff Crown Court]], and the administrative headquarters of the [[Welsh Government]] dominate the area. Behind the City Hall is the [[Welsh National War Memorial]]. [[Bute Park]] also dominates the northwest of the area, running behind [[Cardiff Castle]] along the River Taff southward to Westgate Street and northward to [[Gabalfa]]. Cardiff's Winter Wonderland [[ice rink]] and fairground returns to the front lawn of the City Hall every winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Boulevard de [[Nantes]] and [[Stuttgart]]er Strasse, named after Cardiff's twin cities, run through the southern end and act as a northern bypass of parallel Queen Street for the A4161. To the west, it is connected to Kingsway (leading to Castle Street and St Mary Street), and Dumfries Place/ Newport Road to the east. Park Place runs north to south through the area, linking it to the A470 in the north and Queen Street in the south

==Eastern city centre==

===Dumfries Place/Newport Road===

[[File:Queen Street junction with Dumfries Place.JPG|thumb|left|The junction of Newport Road, Queen Street and Dumfries Place]]
'''Dumfries Place''' is named after the [[Earl of Dumfries]], a courtesy title given to the [[Marquis of Bute]]'s eldest son.

[[Newport Road]], the major road leading east from Queen Street towards the neighbouring city of [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], has been one of the prime office locations of central Cardiff since the 1960s. Some of the original buildings have been converted from office use to residential (e.g. The Aspect, Admiral House&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=967
| title      = Admiral House  {{font|size=90%|text = Also known as Forty Newport Road}}
| date       = {{date|22 dec 2008}}
| accessdate = {{date| 9 mar 2013}}
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or hotel use including the [[Holland House, Cardiff|Mercure Holland House]]. Occupancy of the remaining commercial property has increased, reflecting a shortage of office space in the city and there is now little scope for further conversion. Newport Road is also home to several buildings owned by [[Cardiff University]], and Shand House, occupied by [[Cardiff Institute for the Blind]].

Newport Road is also the site for the [[Cardiff Royal Infirmary]], now providing long term care and rehabilitation. The hospital once housed 500 beds and provided the main A&amp;E service for Cardiff before the [[University Hospital of Wales]] took over these functions.

[[File:The big squeeze^ - geograph.org.uk - 1186370.jpg|thumb|right|The eastern side of Churchill Way]]

===Churchill Way===

'''Churchill Way''' runs parallel to the west of Station Terrace (Cardiff Queen Street station) and joins Queen Street in the north and Bute Terrace in the south. The [[Capitol Centre]] is on the corner with Queen Street. Further along this road are office and modern apartment developments. The Cardiff office of the [[Driving Standards Agency]], former [[Centrica|British Gas]] offices in [[Helmont House]] (now a [[Premier Inn]]), and an [[Hotel Ibis|Ibis]] Hotel are located on this street.  The Cardiff office of the DSA subsequently closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Southwestern city centre==

===Wood Street===
[[File:Wood Street, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|Wood Street]]
'''Wood Street''' is the main access point for [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff Central railway]] and [[Cardiff Central bus station|Central bus]] stations, with the latter undergoing reconstruction since early 2008. The street also has bus stands running along the length of the street as well. Travelling westwards along this street are the [[Millennium Stadium]], Millennium Plaza (with bars, night clubs, comedy clubs and a [[Vue Cinemas|Vue cinema]]), [[Stadium House]], ''Media Wales'' (offices of the [[South Wales Echo]] and [[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]) and Southgate House, (which houses among other organisations the Cardiff offices for the Armed Forces).

===Central Square===
{{main|Central Square, Cardiff}}
'''Central Square''' is a large public space between Wood Street and Cardiff Central railway station. It includes Cardiff bus station. In 2012 plans were announced to redevelop the square and rename it 'Capital Square'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Westgate Street===
[[File:Westgate_Street_(south)_Cardiff.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The southern end of Westgate Street towards the perpendicular Wood Street]]

'''Westgate Street''' runs parallel just west of St Marys Street for about half of the latter's length, linked by several alleys and lanes. Linking Castle Street and Wood Street, [[Cardiff Arms Park]] and the [[Millennium Stadium]] dominate its western side, whereas pubs and bars and hotels dominate its eastern side, with the [[Angel Hotel, Cardiff|Angel Hotel]] at the north end and the [[Royal Hotel, Cardiff|Royal Hotel]] to the south.

==The Hayes==
{{main|The Hayes}}
[[Image:Cardiff arcade.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Morgan Arcade]]
[[File:Caroline Street Cardiff.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Caroline Street looking south]]
The Hayes ({{lang-cy|Yr Ais}}) is where the [[department store]] [[Howells (department store)|Howells]], Bwyty Hayes Island Snack Bar, [[Spillers Records]], [[St David's Hall]], and elegant [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s are found. At the northern end is Cardiff's Grade II* listed [[Old Library, Cardiff|Old Library building]] (location of the [[Cardiff Story]] people's museum).

The Hayes used to be home to [[David Morgan (department store)|David Morgan department store]], an historic local landmark that dominated the shop fronts on the western side of The Hayes. Since its closure in 2005, the Grade&amp;nbsp;I{{nbhyph}}listed David Morgan Buildings have been subdivided into several retail units, and the upper floors converted into 56 luxury apartments. The exterior of the building received a comprehensive refurbishment, with the street clock being reinstated and the façade being restored to its original design, following many alterations since its construction in the late 1800s.

The eastern side of the Hayes is fronted by the new [[St. David's Centre#St. David's|St. Davids 2]] shopping centre. Prior to this it was home to Oxford Arcade, a post war construction that dated quickly and was underused given its central location.

[[File:Alliance Cardiff.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Alliance (sculpture)|Alliance]] in front of Cardiff Central Library]]
The southern end features the [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis department store]] and the new [[Cardiff Central Library]], which opened in March 2009. The previous Central Library closed in 2006 to make way for the construction of the St. David's 2 shopping centre and was located a few hundred yards north-east on Bridge Street.

As part of the St Davids 2 development, the Hayes was pedestrianised and repaved. A new public square was created at its southern end with a large, interactive public artwork as its centrepiece called [[Alliance (sculpture)|Alliance]], a {{convert|25|m|ft|0}} high sculpture consisting of a large stainless steel and enamelled metal ring and an arrow column, which was initially meant to feature lights that would rise and fall with the tide.

===Caroline Street===
{{main|Caroline Street (Cardiff)}}
Caroline Street is a pedestrianised link between St Mary Street and The Hayes. The street has been a host to all kinds of stores but has seen a surge in chip and kebab shops, and as such is commonly known as ''Chip Lane'' or ''Chip Alley''. Around 2003, the north side of the street was redeveloped after the demolition of the old [[S A Brain|Brains]] Brewery. In its place were luxury flats encircling the [[Old Brewery Quarter]], where new shops, bars and restaurants were erected.  The pavement on the street was re{{nbhyph}}tiled as part of this development.

==Southeastern city centre==

===Callaghan Square===
{{main|Callaghan Square}}

This development, built in 1999, extends the central business district south of the mainline railway. Eventually the main development will include approximately 850,000 square feet (77,000 m²) of office space and other uses, of which approximately 350,000 square feet (33,000 m²) is complete (with the largest occupiers being Eversheds and British Gas). Further phases are unlikely to be built on a speculative basis. The initial masterplan suggest that the final phase, yet to be commenced, will also include hotel and residential use. Nearby offices on Tresillian Way (housing The AA, and Lloyds TSB Black Horse finance amongst others) plus further potential developments have turned the area relatively quickly into one of the largest office locations in Central Cardiff. Within a few years total office space in the area will exceed 1 million square feet (90,000 m²).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[File:Atrium, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Atrium]]

===Custom House Street/Bute Terrace/Adam Street===

These two roads have traditionally formed the southern and southeastern boundaries of the [[central business district]] of Cardiff, and in the 2000s have seen a great deal of new development. Recent developments such as the 23{{nbhyph}}storey [[Altolusso]] apartment complex, and the Big Sleep Hotel were set to be joined by (from west to east), a new 11{{nbhyph}}storey office building (on the site of the 120-year-old Central Hotel &amp;ndash; destroyed by fire in early 2003;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

From the north, North Road (A470) meets the city centre at the junction with Castle Street and Boulevard de Nantes, with the latter route forming a northern and eastern by{{nbhyph}}pass, meeting Newport Road (A4161) and then Callaghan Square, just south of the city centre.

From the west, the centre is accessed from Castle Street (A4161), Wood Street and Penarth Road (A4160), with St. Mary's Street connecting the three, but is restricted to no{{nbhyph}}car traffic. Penarth Road terminates at Callaghan Square.

From the south, Lloyd George Avenue (A470), Bute Street and the Central Link (A4234) originate from [[Cardiff Bay]] and meet the city centre at Callaghan Square.

==Transport in the city centre==
{{see also|Transport in Cardiff}}

===Bus===
The vast majority of [[Cardiff Bus]] services run to or through the city centre, approaching from the west along either Tudor Street or Westgate Street, from the north along North Road or Newport Road, from the east along Newport Road and from the south along Callaghan Square. Most services circle the city centre, creating a "bus box". Some terminate or pass through [[Cardiff Central bus station]], off Wood Street, which is currently being redeveloped. Other major interchanges include The Hayes, Dumfries Place, Westgate Street, Greyfriars Road and St. Mary Street, with taxi stands being located next to most of these.

The [[Baycar]] service circles the city centre every 10 minutes before continuing to [[Cardiff Bay]].

===Rail===

[[File:Cardiff Queen Street station April 2009.JPG|thumb|right|Cardiff Queen Street station]]

The city centre is served by two railway stations. [[Cardiff Queen Street]] is in the east of the centre and is the city's main hub for urban services to the rest of Cardiff, its [[South Wales Valleys|valleys]] and the [[Vale of Glamorgan]]. [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff Central]], located in the south of the city centre, is the largest station in the city and one of the busiest in the United Kingdom, focusing on mainline services. Central railway station is located next to Central bus station forming an interchange.

[[Cathays railway station]], [[Grangetown railway station]] and [[Ninian Park railway station]] are all within {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} of the centre serving edges of the city centre.

===Road===
The [[A470 road|A470]] bypasses the centre to the east running southbound to [[Cardiff Bay]] and northbound to [[Cardiff North (geographical area)|North Cardiff]], [[Pontypridd]], [[Merthyr Tydfil]] and [[Brecon]]. The A470 road meets the [[A4232 road|A4232]] at [[Cardiff Bay]], leading to [[Culverhouse Cross]] and the [[M4 motorway]], and also meets the [[A48 road|A48 Camarthen&amp;ndash;Gloucester road]] at [[Gabalfa]], north of the centre.

Some city centre taxis can be hailed. They are usually, but not always, black with a white bonnet or hackney carriages.

===Water===
The [[Cardiff Waterbus]] has stops at Cardiff Castle and Taff Mead Embankment, next to the [[Millennium Stadium]], with services to [[Cardiff Bay]].

===Cycle===
A cycle hire system, similar to those in other large cities, launched in September 2009, and included 70 bikes and 35 hire points (initially 7) around the centre and the south of the city. The cycle hire system was shut down in 2012.

[[File:Zhang Bishi.jpg|thumb|Cheong Fatt Tze]]

'''Cheong Fatt Tze'''  or '''Tjong Tjen Hsoen''' ({{zh|s=张弼士|zh|t=張弼士|p=Zhāng Bìshì}}; 1840 – 1916) was a Chinese businessman and politician. He was a powerful [[Nanyang (region)|Nanyang]] industrialist and a first-class [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin]] in the Manchu government; he was made Consul-General in Singapore and economic advisor to the Empress Dowager. 

==Early life==
He was born in 1840 in [[Dabu County|Dabu]], [[Guangdong Province]] in South [[China]]. 
As he came from a poor [[Hakka people|Hakka]] family, he started working at an early age as a cowherd back in his village. In 1856, [[Taiping Rebellion|civil war]] ravaged much of China, and in that same year another war had broken out between the [[Emperor of China]] and the [[England|English]], known as the [[Second Opium War]] (1856–1862). The people had experienced hardship and suffering during the war. As a result, Cheong Fatt Tze migrated to [[South-East Asia]] together with other coastal Chinese families to seek their fortune.

==Career==
He started as a water-carrier and then became a shopkeeper in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. 
After his marriage, he established a trading company with the help of his father-in-law. Gradually, he began to accumulate his wealth through hard work and perseverance. In 1877, he expanded his business from [[Jakarta]] to [[Medan]]. His business was based on [[agricultural]] products such as [[rubber]], [[coffee]] and [[tea]] but he branched out to the financial sector by acquiring a bank. This move made him a wealthy man.

In 1886, he expanded again to [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]]. As his business grew, he owned three ships which plied between Penang and Medan. In the course of his work, he occasionally resided in Penang and owned a [[Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion|mansion]] in Leith Street, which stands to this day as protected heritage building.

==Political career==
In 1890, in recognition of his hard work and contribution, he was appointed the Chinese Consul, based in Penang. This office was shifted to [[Singapore]] when that city became established as a well-known trading port in [[South-East Asia]]. As the Chinese Consul, he worked tirelessly for the interests of overseas Chinese residents through diplomatic channels with the [[British Empire|British]] authorities.

In 1899, he was summoned to China twice by the [[Emperor of China]] and instructed to present a national development plan, which was well received by the government of the [[Qing dynasty]]. As a result, he was promoted to be the Minister for agriculture, industries, roads and mines for the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]]. Later he was instructed to conduct a study of trade and education in Penang and Singapore. Subsequently, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce was established. In 1904, he established the first Chinese school in Southeast Asia, the [[Chung Hwa Confucian School]] in Penang.

In 1912, the [[Kuomintang]] overthrew the Qing and established a [[Republic of China (1912–49)|republican government]]. Cheong was appointed as a member of the Legislative Assembly so that he could be actively involved with politics. He was also appointed as the Chairman of the Chinese national Chamber of Commerce, which was well received by all parties.

In 1915, he was sent to the [[United States]] to study all aspects of industrialization of that nation. During his journey, when he stopped over in [[Hong Kong]], he was awarded a [[Ph.D.]] in [[Law]].

==Death==
Cheong Fatt Tze died in [[Indonesia]] in 1916. His body was sent back to China to be buried. On its final journey through Penang, Singapore and Hong Kong, the overseas Chinese were greatly saddened by the loss of this great personality. The Chinese government sent a high-ranking official to his funeral and ordered the National Archives to record his life in historical documents so that his contributions would always be remembered. Both the British and the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] authorities ordered flags to be flown at half mast to honour the man who was known as ''"the [[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller]] of the East"''. He had eight wives and owned many residences throughout his trading empire (mostly [[Southeast Asia]]) but made Penang his base, where he raised his six sons.

==Legacy==
In 1894, [[Chung Keng Quee]] hosted in his own gardens, in the name of Vice Consul Chang, Pi Shih (Cheong Fatt Tze), a dinner to welcome Admiral Ting (see Battle of Yalu River (1894) and Battle of Weihaiwei) and the Chinese Imperial Fleet of warships that he commanded.

Cheong  Fatt Tze  first  introduced grape vineyards in China's  Shandong  province, and later  brought in Austrian wine-producing experts to improve the vineyard in  Yantai, Shandong.
Cheong  Fatt Tze  also  gave  shelter  to Sun Yat  Sen and  Sun Yat  Sen 's  fourth  wife in  Penang, Cheong Fatt Tze  also  helped  Sun Yat  Sen  with Money  to  promote  a Chinese  Nationalist  movement in China  after 1911.

A street in George Town, Penang, which was formerly named Hong Kong Street, was renamed after him, Jalan Cheong Fatt Tze. His blue mansion, [[Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion]], is a heritage building, located at Leith Street in George Town. It is open for guided tours, and also offers accommodation and has an on-site restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion|url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/08/malaysia-cheong-fatt-tze-mansion.html|work=Minor Sights|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left another mansion in his birthplace, Dabu, Guangdong Province, China.

'''Constantin Argetoianu''' ({{OldStyleDate|15 March|1871|3 March}} &amp;ndash; 6 February 1955) was a [[Romania]]n politician, one of the best-known personalities of [[Interwar period|interwar]] [[Greater Romania]], who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Prime Minister]] between 28 September and 23 November 1939. His [[memoirs]], ''Memorii. Pentru cei de mâine. Amintiri din vremea celor de ieri'' ("Memoirs. For those of tomorrow. Recollections of yesterday's world")—a cross section of Romanian society, were made known for the sharp critique of several major figures in Romanian politics (using a sarcastic tone which had made his previous political speeches notorious).&lt;ref&gt;Otu; Slabey Roucek, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in [[Craiova]] as the son of [[Romanian Army|Army]] general [[Ioan Argetoianu]], he trained in Law, Medicine, and Letters at the [[University of Paris]], and later entered the diplomatic service (1897).&lt;ref name="Slabey Roucek, p.76"&gt;Slabey Roucek, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an exceptionally prosperous man (a noted [[Bucharest Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange]] player and landowner in [[Breasta]], [[Dolj County]]), and his frequent change in political allegiances was attributed by some of his contemporaries to his financial independence.&lt;ref name="Savu; Slabey Roucek, p.76"&gt;Savu; Slabey Roucek, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a [[combat medic]] with the rank of captain in the [[Second Balkan War]], where he faced a [[cholera]] epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;Manolache&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===

A [[Freemasonry|Freemason]],&lt;ref&gt;Otu&lt;/ref&gt; Argetoianu was first elected to the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]] in 1914 as a [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880-1918)|Conservative Party]] representative,&lt;ref name="Savu; Slabey Roucek, p.76"/&gt; where he oscillated between the dissident the mainstream Conservatives of [[Petre P. Carp]] and the dissident group around [[Take Ionescu]] (the latter was welcoming Romania's entry into [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]], which Argetoianu also proposed).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.251&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1918, during the final stages of the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Romanian Campaign]], Argetoianu was Justice Minister, sitting on the first [[Alexandru Averescu]] cabinet (at the time when authorities had retreated to [[Iaşi]], leaving the southern half of the country to be occupied by [[German Empire|Imperial German]], [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Bulgaria]]n troops).&lt;ref name="Slabey Roucek, p.76"/&gt; He was also head of the Romanian delegation at the Peace preliminaries of [[Buftea]], in 1918. The talks resulted in the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1918|Treaty of Bucharest]] of May, which consecrated Romania's defeat by the [[Central Powers]]. His actions at the time were later the subject of an [[epigram]] by [[Cincinat Pavelescu]] (Pavelescu expressed his belief that the treaty and Argetoianu's views on fiscal policies were to be the subject of scorn for future generations).&lt;ref&gt;Pavelescu&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Party===
Argetoianu followed Averescu into opposition to the [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]] [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) cabinet, and joined the [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]] (PP) created by the latter. He later documented the [[Populism|populist]] message of the movement, and left testimonies of Averescu's spontaneous adulation by the crowds of peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.264; Scurtu, "Prăbuşirea unui mit", "Mit şi realitate..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Argetoianu was Finance Minister and later [[List of Romanian Ministers of the Interior|Interior Minister]] in the second Averescu government of 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Slabey Roucek, p.76; Troncotă, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1921, it was uncovered that an associate of his named Aron Schuller had attempted to contract a 20 million [[Italian lira|lire]] loan with a bank in [[Italy]], using as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] Romanian [[war bond]]s that he had illegally obtained from the Finance Ministry reserve.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Argetoianu, who was still in charge at the time, became the target of attacks from the opposition group formed by the [[Romanian National Party]] and the [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]], being pressed by [[Virgil Madgearu]] and [[Grigore Iunian]] to explain himself (Iunian proposed a [[motion of no confidence]], but the PNL continued to show its support for the PP).&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p.68–70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clash with Communism and split with Averescu===
Argetoianu soon became noted for his [[Anti-Communism|anti-communist]] stance: he carried out arrests of those [[Socialist Party of Romania|Socialist Party]] members who, during their party's congress in May 1921, supported a [[Maximum programme|maximalist platform]] and voted in favor of aligning their Socialist-Communist faction (future [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party of Romania]]) with the [[Comintern]], citing the latter's condemnation of [[Greater Romania]] (all those arrested were prosecuted in the [[Dealul Spirii Trial]]).&lt;ref&gt;Diac; Troncotă, p.18–19&lt;/ref&gt; Argetoianu later stated that the arrest lacked legal grounds, and indicated that he purposely gave the Socialist [[Gheorghe Cristescu]] approval to hold the congress as a means to incriminate the faction.&lt;ref name="Diac"&gt;Diac&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with mixed reactions inside the cabinet (Averescu hesitated, while the Minister of Justice [[Grigore Trancu-Iași]] refused to give him support), he ordered the move without his fellow ministers' prior knowledge, and thus faced them with a ''[[fait accompli]]''.&lt;ref name="Diac"/&gt;

The standoff between Averescu and the parliamentary opposition eventually witnessed a decisive incident: during a prolonged debate over Averescu's proposal to [[Nationalization|nationalize]] enterprises in [[Reşiţa]], Argetoianu addressed a mumbled insult to Madgearu; the PNL, seeing an opportunity for a return to power, expressed sympathy, and all opposition groups appealed to Ferdinand, asking for Averescu's recall (July 14, 1921).&lt;ref name="Scurtu, Prăbuşirea unui mit"&gt;Scurtu, "Prăbuşirea unui mit"&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Averescu's eventual defeat in December 1921, Argetoianu was kept in office by the [[Take Ionescu]] and Brătianu cabinets. During the spring of 1922, he ordered the killing of several Communist activists who were held in prison custody, including [[Leonte Filipescu]], staging their attempts to flee from under escort as a pretext.&lt;ref&gt;Troncotă, p.18–19&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, pressures on the revolutionary grouping were relaxed in summer, when [[King of Romania|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] approved an [[amnesty]] and Argetoianu officially declared that "communism is over in Romania".&lt;ref&gt;Argetoianu, in Diac; in Troncotă, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

===PND and PNL===
In 1923, after Brătianu again assumed power, he clashed with Averescu and proclaimed himself leader of the PP, being eventually expelled.&lt;ref name="Scurtu, Prăbuşirea unui mit"/&gt; Having joined [[Nicolae Iorga]]'s [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalist Party]] (PND), he soon vehemently protested against the latter's alliance with the Romanian National Party, and moved to the PNL.&lt;ref name="Slabey Roucek, p.76"/&gt;

Following the sudden death of Ion I. C. Brătianu in 1927, and choosing, in contrast to the policies of [[Dinu Brătianu]], to support the new King [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] in 1930, Argetoianu left the party and subsequently defined himself as an independent.&lt;ref name="Slabey Roucek, p.76"/&gt; In effect, he moved into the camp of politicians approving of an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime around Carol.&lt;ref name="Veiga, p.130"&gt;Veiga, p.130&lt;/ref&gt; As the monarch's relations with the traditional political class were souring, Argetoianu allegedly engaged in a campaign to draw new allegiances from other environments, aiding to establish a Romanian ''[[Camarilla (history)|camarilla]]'' &amp;mdash; it was even reported that, using the official commitment to neutral [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocracy]] as a means to appoint his choice of people to positions of influence, he had recruited his fellow [[Bucharest]] [[Jockey Club of Bucharest|Jockey Club]] members.&lt;ref name="Veiga, p.130"/&gt; Among his most vocal supporters at the time was the [[far right]] philosopher [[Nae Ionescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.226; Veiga, p.200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iorga cabinet and Agrarian Party===
He was again in charge of Internal Affairs and Finance from 1931 to 1932, during the Iorga government,&lt;ref&gt;Slabey Roucek, p.76; Veiga, p.137–138&lt;/ref&gt; when he took a harsh stance against the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]], outlawing it and arresting some of its members (which led to a string of violent confrontations).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.295, 296; Veiga, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; Argetoianu was hotly contested as Finance Minister: faced with the widespread [[insolvency]] of small agricultural holdings in front of the [[Great Depression]], he proposed a form of [[liquidation]] that was considered in breach of the [[1923 Constitution of Romania|1923 Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.130, 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; Various other issues forced Argetoianu to cease payments of salaries for [[Civil service|civil servants]] at certain intervals, causing far-reaching problems.&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

The government was voted out of office in the elections of 1932, when Iorga was replaced by [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]], a member of the [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNŢ) who was himself challenged with solving the agrarian issue;&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.138, 141&lt;/ref&gt; Argetoianu subsequently founded the minor [[Agrarian Union Party]], which, after the National Liberals returned to power with [[Ion G. Duca]], remained a close associate of the king in his competition with traditional forces; when Duca was assassinated by the Iron Guard in the final days of 1933, Argetoianu, together with his former adversary, PNŢ dissident [[Grigore Iunian]], and the [[National Agrarian Party (Romania)|National Agrarian Party]]'s [[Octavian Goga]], was probably one of the king's main options in his attempt to create an altogether new political establishment around the ''camarilla'', relying on a compromise with [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]] (leader of the Iron Guard).&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.202, 209, 215&lt;/ref&gt; Codreanu refused to accept negotiation, but Carol successfully approached the PNL's "young liberals" faction, which came to power with [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]] (January 1934).&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.202&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal dictatorship and World War II===
The frequent target of attacks in the Iron Guard press,&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.243, 245&lt;/ref&gt; Argetoianu led his grouping until 1938, when, faced with the unstoppable rise of the Iron Guard, Carol banned all parties and established his [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN).&lt;ref&gt;Argetoianu, "Pleacă Tătărescu, vine Gigurtu"; Veiga, p.215&lt;/ref&gt;

His own short-lived FRN cabinet, established after that date, was, after [[Gheorghe Argeşanu]]'s the second in quick succession to the violent clash between the Guard and monarch (after the murder of [[Armand Călinescu]] by the former). The Argetoianu government was replaced by that of Tătărescu, who had to deal with the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia|occupation of Bessarabia]] and was in turn replaced with [[Ion Gigurtu]]&lt;ref&gt;Argetoianu, "Pleacă Tătărescu, vine Gigurtu"&lt;/ref&gt; (Argetoianu, who remained influential throughout the period, began calling for a rapprochement between Romania and the Soviets).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Otu&lt;/ref&gt;

Carol's regime crumbled after the [[Second Vienna Award]], when Romania had to cede [[Northern Transylvania]] to [[Hungary]]; it was replaced by the Iron Guard's [[National Legionary State]], which, itself repressed during the previous years, began a campaign of retaliation &amp;mdash; like Tătărescu and several others, Argetoianu was kidnapped on November 27, 1940 in the wake of the [[Jilava Massacre]], and faced assassination until being rescued by the intervention of [[Romanian Army]] officials.&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.292, 309&lt;/ref&gt;

Retreating from public life during [[World War II]] and the [[Ion Antonescu]] dictatorship (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''), Argetoianu left the country in the spring of 1944, settling in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Romania's withdrawal from the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] and the start of [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]] caused him to return in November, seeing an opportunity in the apparent decrease in the appeal of traditional parties and expanding on his vision of Romanian-Soviet cooperation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He was the subject of derision in the [[National Peasants' Party]] press (''[[Dreptatea]]'' wrote of him: "leading the intrigue in favor of a [[private property]]–based [[communism]], a [[Capitalism|capitalist]]-based [[socialism]], a [[Working class|mass]]-free [[democracy]]... The country is trustingly placing itself at your disposal. Here are your strings: pull them! Here are your back rooms: maneuver them! Here is your «people»: take it away!").&lt;ref&gt;"Profilo", in Otu&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNMR, arrest, and death===

Attempting in vain to mediate between the Communists and the PNȚ, Argetoianu was rejected by both sides, and, in January 1947, formed his own grouping &amp;mdash; the ''National Union for Work and Reconstruction'' (''Uniunea Națională Muncă și Refacere'', UNMR) &amp;mdash;, alongside [[Nicolae Ottescu]], [[Nicolae D. Cornățeanu]], [[Zamfir Brătescu]] and others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It was kept under surveillance by the Communist-controlled [[Petru Groza]] government, and was infiltrated by the pro-Communist ''National-Agrarian Action'' (''Acțiunea Național-Agrară'', ANA).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The UNMR disbanded over worries that Argetoianu was losing credibility with Soviet authorities—the group around Cornățeanu joined Premier Groza's [[Ploughmen's Front]], while others entered the [[Union of Patriots (Romania)|Union of Patriots]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Argetoianu, who was ill at the time and had just undergone surgery on his [[prostate]], withdrew from public life for a second time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Two years after a [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] was imposed on Romania, on the morning of May 6, 1950, he was arrested by the [[Securitate]]; while being taken away, he was heard saying: "Man, you sure are tough, you communists, if you are afraid of a farting old man such as myself".&lt;ref&gt;Argetoianu, in Otu&lt;/ref&gt; He died in the infamous [[Sighet prison]] five years later,&lt;ref&gt;* {{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24867">In regulatory jurisdictions that provide for it (comprising most or all [[developed country|developed countries]] with [[free market]] economies), '''consumer protection''' is a group of laws and organizations designed to ensure the [[rights]] of [[consumers]] as well as [[fair trade]], competition and accurate information in the [[marketplace]]. The laws are designed to prevent the businesses that engage in [[fraud]] or specified [[Anti-competitive practices|unfair practices]] from gaining an advantage over competitors. They may also provide additional protection for those most vulnerable in society. Consumer protection laws are a form of government [[regulation]] that aim to protect the rights of consumers. For example, a government may require businesses to disclose detailed information about products—particularly in areas where safety or public health is an issue, such as food.

Consumer protection is linked to the idea of '''consumer rights''' and to the formation of [[consumer organizations]], which help consumers make better choices in the marketplace and get help with [[consumer complaints]]. Other organizations that promote consumer protection include government organizations and self-regulating business organizations such as consumer protection agencies and organizations, [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]], the [[Federal Trade Commission]] in America and [[Better Business Bureau]]s in America and Canada, etc.

A consumer is defined as someone who acquires goods or services for direct use or ownership rather than for resale or use in production and manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;"West Encyclopedia of American Law. Consumer. Answers.com. n.d.. Retrieved on January 31, 2010"&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumer interests can also be protected by promoting competition in the markets which directly and indirectly serve consumers, consistent with economic efficiency, but this topic is treated in [[competition law]]. Consumer protection can also be asserted via non-government organizations and individuals as [[consumer activism]].

==Consumer law==
Consumer protection law or consumer law is considered as an area of law that regulates [[private law]] relationships between individual consumers and the businesses that sell those goods and services. Consumer protection covers a wide range of topics, including but not necessarily limited to [[product liability]], [[privacy rights]], [[unfair business practices]], [[fraud]], [[misrepresentation]], and other consumer/business interactions. It's a way of preventing frauds and scams from service and sales contracts, eligible fraud, bill collector regulation, pricing, utility turnoffs, consolidation, [[personal loans]] that may lead to [[bankruptcy]].

The following lists consumer legislation at the nation-state level. In the EU member states Germany and the United Kingdom there is also the applicability of law at the EU level to be considered; this applies on the basis of [[subsidiarity]].

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the corresponding agency is the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] or the individual State Consumer Affairs agencies. The [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] has responsibility for consumer protection regulation of financial services and products. However, in practice, it does so through privately run EDR schemes such as the [[Financial Ombudsman Service (Australia)]].

===Nigeria===
The Nigerian government has a duty to protect its people from any form of harm to human health through the use and purchase of items to meet daily needs. In light of this, the [[Nigerian Consumer Protection Council (CPC)]], whose aim is to protect and enhance consumers' interest through information, education, and enforcement of the rights of consumers was established by an Act of Parliament  to promote and protect the interest of consumers over all products and services. In a nutshell, it is empowered to Eliminate hazardous &amp; substandard goods from the market. Provide speedy redress to consumer complaints and petition arisen from fraud, unfair practice and exploitation of consumer.
 
===Germany===

[[Germany]], as a member state of the [[European Union]], is bound by the consumer protection [[European Directive|directives]] of the European Union; residents may be directly bound by EU regulations.
A minister of the federal cabinet is responsible for consumer rights and protection (''Verbraucherschutzminister''). In the current cabinet of [[Angela Merkel]], this is [[Daniel Lindigrin]].

When issuing public warnings about products and services, the issuing authority has to take into account that this affects the supplier's constitutionally protected economic liberty, see [[Bundesverwaltungsgericht]] (Federal Administrative Court) Case 3 C 34.84, 71 BVerwGE 183).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oefre.unibe.ch/law/dfr/vw071183.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{See also|Consumer Protection Act of 1986|National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission}}

In [[India]], consumer protection is specified in The Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Under this law, Separate Consumer Dispute Redress Forums  have been set up throughout India in each and every district in which a consumer can file his complaint on a simple paper with nominal court fees and his complaint will be decided by the Presiding Officer of the District Level.  The complaint can be filed by both the consumer of a goods as well as of the services. An appeal could be filed to the State Consumer Disputes Redress Commissions and after that to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncdrc.nic.in/|title=NATIONAL CONSUMER DISPUTES REDRESSAL COMMISSION|website=ncdrc.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The procedures in these [[tribunal]]s are relatively less formal and more people friendly and they also take less time to decide upon a consumer dispute&lt;ref name="CONSUMER PROTECTION AND NATIONAL CONSUMER DISPUTES REDRESS COMMISSION"&gt;V. Balakrishna Eradi, [http://ncdrc.nic.in/|publisher=NCDRC "Consumer Protection and National Consumer Disputes Redress Commission"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721172525/http://ncdrc.nic.in/ |date=July 21, 2011 }}. New Delhi: [[National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission]]. Accessed 25 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; when compared to the years long time taken by the traditional [[Indian judiciary]]. In recent years, many effective judgment have been passed by some state and National Consumer Forums.

[[Indian Contract Act, 1872]] lays down the conditions in which promises made by parties to a contract will be legally binding on each other. It also lays down the remedies available to aggregate party if the other party fails to honor his promise.

[[The Sale of Goods Act of 1930]] act provides some safeguards to buyers of goods if goods purchased do not fulfill the express or implied conditions and warranties.

[[The Agriculture Produce Act of 1937]] act provides grade standards for agricultural commodities and live stock products.It specifies the conditions which govern the use of standards and lays down the procedure for grading, marking and packaging of agricultural produce.The quality mark provided under the act is known as AGMARK-Agricultural Marketing.

===Taiwan===
Modern Taiwanese law has been heavily influenced by European civil law systems, particularly German and Swiss law. The Civil Code in Taiwan contains five books: General Principles, Obligations, Rights over Things, Family, and Succession. The second book of the Code, the Book of Obligations, provided the basis from which consumers could bring products liability actions prior to the enactment of the CPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luatcanhtranhvabaovenguoitieudung.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/taiwan-consumer-protection-law/|title=(TAIWAN) CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW|date=1 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/news/news_detail.aspx?id=189|title=Laws &amp; Regulations Database of The Republic of China|website=law.moj.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Consumer Protection Law (CPL)]] in [[Taiwan]], as promulgated on January 11, 1994, and effective on January 13, 1993, specifically protects the interests and safety of customers using the products or services provided by business operators. The Consumer Protection Commission of Executive Yuan serves as an ombudsman supervising, coordinating, reporting any unsafe products/services and periodically reviewing the legislation.

According to the Pacific Rim Law &amp; Policy Association and the American Chamber of Commerce, in a 1997 critical study, the law has been criticized by stating that "although many agree that the intent of the CPL is fair, the CPL's various problems, such as ambiguous terminology, favoritism towards consumer protection groups, and the compensation liability defense, must be addressed before the CPL becomes a truly effective piece of legislation that will protect consumers"&lt;ref&gt;Carol T. Juang, [http://digital.law.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/885/6PacRimLPolyJ219.pdf?sequence=1 "The Taiwan Consumer Protection Law: Attempt to Protect Consumers Proves Ineffective"] Pacific Rim Law &amp; Policy Association, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom]], as it is still a member state of the [[European Union]], is bound by the consumer protection [[European Directive|directives]] of the European Union; residents may be directly bound by EU regulations. Specifics of the division of labour between the EU and the UK are detailed here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU law and the balance of competences: A short guide and glossary, 2012|url=http://www.gov.uk/guidance/eu-law-and-the-balance-of-competences-a-short-guide-and-glossary|publisher=Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic (UK) laws originated within the ambit of [[contract]] and [[tort]] but, with the influence of [[EU law]], it is emerging as an independent area of law. In many circumstances, where domestic law is in question, the matter judicially treated as [[tort]], [[contract]], [[restitution]] or even [[criminal law]].

Consumer Protection issues are dealt with when complaints are made to the [[Director-General of Fair Trading|Director-General of Fair Trade]]. The [[Office of Fair Trading]]&lt;ref name="U.K. OFT"&gt;[http://www.oft.gov.uk/ U.K. Office of Fair Trading], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; will then investigate, impose an injunction or take the matter to [[litigation]]. However, consumers cannot directly complain to the OFT. Complaints need to be made to the Citizens Advice Consumer Service (which has taken over from Consumer Direct) who will provide legal advice to complainants, or re-direct the individual complaint to Trading Standards for investigation. Due to restrictions within the Enterprise Act 2002, individual complainants are unable to be told whether their case is being investigated or not. In very rare cases, Consumer Direct may direct a very large number of complaints to the OFT to be considered as a systemic complaint. The OFT can also be engaged by consumer groups e.g. The Consumers Association or the statutory consumer protection body – Consumer Focus – via a super complaint. The OFT rarely prosecute companies, however, preferring a light touch regulation approach. Consumer complaints against companies are not published, but investigation work, undertakings, and enforcement are located at.&lt;ref&gt;U.K. Office of Fair Trading, [http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/consumer-enforcement/ "Consumer Enforcement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313020125/http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/consumer-enforcement/ |date=2011-03-13 }}, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the consumer protection laws e.g. Distance Selling Regulations 2000 or Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 ({{Time ago|1999|magnitude=years}}) are actually UK implementations of EU directives. The OFT is one of the bodies responsible for enforcing these rules. It leads to a problem that these examples of legislation are clearly designed to deal with individual complaints but the OFT will only deal with systemic complaints and will ignore individual complainants redirecting them back to Consumer Direct.

The Office of Fair Trading also acts as the UK's official consumer and competition watchdog, with a remit to make markets work well for consumers, and at a local, municipal level by [[Trading Standards]] departments. General consumer advice can be obtained from the Citizens Advice Consumer Service or via a local branch of the [[Citizen's Advice Bureau]].

On the 3rd September, Conservative MEP Daniel Dalton proposed plans to the European Parliament's Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee to introduce an App that would provide a single source of advice and dispute resolution.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Conservative MEP unveils new consumer rights proposals |url= http://conservativeeurope.com/news/conservative-mep-unveils-new-consumer-rights-proposals|work=Conservatives in the European Parliament|date=3 September 2018|author=Daniel Dalton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:CDCA auto repair notice.jpg|thumb|Consumer protection laws often mandate the posting of notices, such as this one which appears in all [[Auto mechanic|automotive repair]] shops in California]]
In the [[United States]] a variety of laws at both the federal and state levels regulate consumer affairs. Among them are the federal [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], [[Fair Debt Collection Practices Act]], the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]], [[Truth in Lending Act]], [[Fair Credit Billing Act]], and the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]]. Federal consumer protection laws are mainly enforced by the [[Federal Trade Commission]], the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]], and the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].

At the state level, many states have adopted the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821232355/http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/fnact99/1920_69/rudtpa66.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=21 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including, but not limited to, Delaware,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://delcode.delaware.gov/title6/c025/sc03/index.shtml|title=TITLE  6 - CHAPTER 25.

The Uniform Act contains a private remedy with attorneys fees for prevailing parties where the losing party "willfully engaged in the trade practice knowing it to be deceptive". Uniform Act §3(b).
Missouri has a similar statute called the Merchandising Practices Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/40700000201.html|title=Missouri Revisor of Statutes - Revised Statutes of Missouri, RSMo, Missouri Law, MO Law|website=www.moga.mo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This statute allows local prosecutors or the Attorney General to press charges against people who knowingly use deceptive business practices in a consumer transaction and authorizes consumers to hire a private attorney to bring an action seeking their actual damages, punitive damages, and attorney's fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flesnerwentzel.com/#!merchandising-practices-act/c1k1e|title=St. Charles Family Law and St. Louis Divorce Attorneys Flesner Wentzel|author=|date=|website=St. Charles Family Law and St. Louis Divorce Attorneys Flesner Wentzel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.onlinedivorce.com/| title= Online Divorce }} Wednesday, 19 September 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the majority of states have a Department of Consumer Affairs devoted to regulating certain industries and protecting consumers who use goods and services from those industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medlawplus.com/classaction/attorneygeneralconsumeraffairs.tpl|title=MedlawPlus Divorce Process Resource - Welcome To The Top Free Online Divorce Resource|author=|date=|website=Welcome To The Top Free Online Divorce Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in California, the [[California Department of Consumer Affairs]] regulates about 2.3 million professionals in over 230 different professions, through its forty regulatory entities. In addition, California encourages its consumers to act as [[private attorney general|private attorneys general]] through the liberal provisions of its [[Consumers Legal Remedies Act]].

[[California]] has the strongest consumer protection laws of any US state, partly because of rigorous advocacy and lobbying by groups such as Utility Consumers' Action Network, [[Consumer Federation of California]], and [[Privacy Rights Clearinghouse]]. For example, California provides for "cooling off" periods giving consumers the right to cancel contracts within a certain time period for several specified types of transactions, such as home secured transactions, and warranty and repair services contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://la.lawsoup.org/legal-guides/laws-by-role/consumer/contract-cancellation-cooling-off-periods/|title=Contract Cancellation periods or "Cooling off periods"|date=2014-07-09|work=Law Soup LA|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other states have been the leaders in specific aspects of consumer protection. For example, Florida, Delaware, and Minnesota have legislated requirements that contracts be written at reasonable readability levels as a large proportion of contracts cannot be understood by most consumers who sign them.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis D. Eigen, [http://scriptamus.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/a-solution-to-the-problem-of-consumer-contracts-that-cannot-be-understood-by-consumers/ "A Solution to the Problem of Consumer Contracts That Cannot be Understood by Consumers Who Sign Them"], Scriptamus, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2920">The '''Cosmetic Ingredient Review''' ('''CIR'''), based in [[Washington, D.C.]], assesses and reviews the safety of ingredients in cosmetics and publishes the results in peer-reviewed scientific literature. The company was established in 1976 by the [[Personal Care Products Council]] (then called the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association), with support of the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and the [[Consumer Federation of America]].

== Operations ==

In 2013, Dr. F. Alan Andersen, the CIR’s director, said that its annual budget "is not a matter of public record". The CIR does not file [[Form 990]]s, which show annual revenues and expenses. Overall funding for CIR comes from the cosmetic industry’s main trade association, the Personal Care Products Council.&lt;ref name="tips"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/may_june_2013/features/beauty_tips_for_the_fda044515.php?page=1 |work=The Washington Monthly |title= Beauty Tips for the FDA |author=John F. Wasik |date=May–June 2013 |accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Personal Care Products Council, is a not-for-profit 501(c)(6) with 2011 revenue of -$742,260.  It paid its top 15 executives a total of $5,294,564.00 in 2012 and Dr. Andersen's salary was $337,260.00 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2012/131/390/2012-131390920-0965f921-9O.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemicals reviewed ==

In 2002, the CIR decided that it was safe for the industry to continue adding possible endocrine and reproductive disruptors known as [[phthalates]] to cosmetics marketed to women of childbearing age.&lt;ref name="tips"/&gt; In August 2008, Section 108 of the federal [[Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act]] (CPSIA), public law 110-314,&lt;ref&gt;GovTrack.us. "[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-4040 H.R. 4040--110th Congress (2007): Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008], GovTrack.us (database of federal legislation). Retrieved 14 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; banned the use of three phthalates, [[DEHP]], [[Dibutyl phthalate|DBP]], and [[Benzyl butyl phthalate|BBP]], in children's toy and child care articles. Some phthalates were restricted in children's toys sold in [[California]] starting in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/85/i43/8543news4.html California Bans Phthalates In Toys For Children], Bette Hileman, ''Chemical and Engineering News'', October 22, 2007, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the [[European Union]] bans nearly 1,400 chemicals from personal care products because they are carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic to reproduction. In the United States, CIR has found only eleven chemicals to be "unsafe for use in cosmetics".&lt;ref name="tips"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3660">A '''cost-plus-incentive fee''' ('''CPIF''') contract is a cost-reimbursement [[contract]] that provides for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs.&lt;ref name="US"&gt;
   "Subpart 16.3—Cost-Reimbursement Contracts", U.S.
   [[Federal Acquisition Regulations]], July 2010, webpage:
   [https://www.acquisition.gov/far/html/Subpart%2016_3.html F3].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Like a [[cost-plus contract]], the price paid by the buyer to the seller changes in relation to costs, in order to reduce the risks assumed by the contractor (seller).
Unlike a cost-plus contract, the cost in excess of the target cost is only partially paid according to a Buyer/Seller ratio, so the seller's profit decreases when exceeding the target cost. Similarly, the seller's profit increases when actual costs are below the target cost defined in the contract.

==Formula and Examples==
Incentive contracts allow sharing of the risks between the contractor and the client. The contractor is reimbursed all its justifiable costs in addition to a calculated fee. The basic elements of a CPIF contract are:
:*'''Target Cost''': the estimated total contract costs.
:*'''Actual Cost''': constitutes the reasonable costs that the contractor can prove he has made.
:*'''Target Fee''': the basic fee to be paid if the Target Cost matches the Actual Cost (target profit). The Target Fee varies between the Minimum Fee and the Maximum Fee according to a formula tied to the Actual Cost (e.g. Target Fee could be 10% of the Actual Cost).
:*'''Sharing Ratio''': the agreed upon cost sharing proportion, normally expressed in percentage (e.g. 85% for the client / 15% for the contractor). It is often different for cost overruns and cost underruns.
Other components of incentive fee contracting include:
:*'''Maximum Fee''': the highest fee that may be earned, usually expressed as a percentage.
:*'''Minimum Fee''': the lowest fee that may be earned, usually expressed as a percentage.

The Final Fee (profit of the contractor) is expressed as follows: Final Fee = Target Fee + (Target Cost - Actual Cost) * Contractor Share&lt;ref&gt;In the formula, an asterisk ("*") is used for multiplication.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1642103&amp;show=abstract Badenfelt, Ulrika. "The selection of sharing ratios in target cost contracts." Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management 15.1 (2008): 54-65]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Final Price of the contract is expressed as follows: Final Price = Actual Cost + Final Fee

Note that if Contractor Share = 1, the contract is a Fixed Price Contract; if Contractor Share = 0, the contract is a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0263786394900450 Stephen Ward, Chris Chapman, Choosing contractor payment terms, International Journal of Project Management, Volume 12, Issue 4, November 1994, Pages 216-221, ISSN 0263-7863, 10.1016/0263-7863(94)90045-0]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, assume a CPIF with:
:*Target Cost = 1,000
:*Target Fee = 100
:*Benefit/Cost Sharing Ratio for cost overruns = 80% Client / 20% Contractor
:*Benefit/Cost Sharing Ratio for cost underruns = 60% Client / 40% Contractor

If the Actual Cost is higher than the Target Cost, say 1,100, the client will pay: 1,100 + 100 + (1,000 - 1,100) * 0.2 = 1,180 (contractor earns 80).

If the Actual Cost is lower than the Target Cost, say 900, the client will pay: 900 + 100 + (1,000 - 900) * 0.4 = 1,040 (contractor earns 140).

After graduating as an engineer in 1970, he made a career in the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]] in the 1970s to 1980s.
A protégé of the first Kyrgyz president, [[Askar Akayev]], he was given the position of governor of [[Talas, Kyrgyzstan|Talas]] in 1991&amp;ndash;1992, and president of [[Kyrgyzaltyn]], a state company formed in 1992 with the purpose of the development of gold deposits.  In this position, he was alleged to have perpetrated serious fraud and embezzlement against the government.&lt;ref&gt;"The management of this newly formed state company was given to Dastan Sarygulov, who had no previous mining experience, but who was a close associate of president Akaev's wife" [...] "a man frequently charged with corruption and incompetence", quotations from Handrahan (ed.) ''Gendering ethnicity: implications for democracy assistance'', Routledge, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-415-93252-3}},  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=jGTXJ65Z2j4C&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Dastan+Sarygulov&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tdZzEdk64Y&amp;sig=AU9Ik_je9aQbZvRJDRTRZXflzF8&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cx1KT8bhGdCfOpiJ2YQO&amp;ved=0CHcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Dastan%20Sarygulov&amp;f=false p. 120]
&lt;/ref&gt;

When Akaev was ousted by the [[Tulip Revolution]], Sarygulov  managed to secure the position of state secretary in the cabinet of president  [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]], formed after the [[Kyrgyzstani presidential election, 2005|2005 election]],  but was forced to step down under president in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1068439.html  May 16, 2006 (RFE/RL)]&lt;/ref&gt;
During his time in office, he also chaired an ideological committee where he proposed the adoption of "[[Tengrism]]" as an [[ethnocentric]] Kyrgyz national ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Marat, [http://www.cacianalyst.org/?q=node/126 Kyrgyz Government Unable to Produce New National Ideology ], 22 February 2006, CACI Analyst, Central Asia-Caucasus Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''electronic receipt''' or '''e-receipt''' is an electronic [[Receipt]] of any product or service that was purchased.

== Implementation ==
Digital receipts are normally sent via e-mail or via an app. Unlike paper receipts, e-receipts are used to reduce paper usage. These e-receipts are used to inform the customer of rebates and discounts. Another important purpose is to use the digital receipts as marketing instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Perring |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/639219/Ereceipts-British-shops-shopping-electronic-Internet |title=Retailers are now monitoring YOUR shopping habits and transactions with the eReceipt... |work=[[Daily Express#Sunday Express]] |date=2016-01-29 |accessdate=2016-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the use of e-receipts is [[Business Intelligence]]. Through the usage of these e-receipts, companies can track their customers easier in terms of purchases, which supports the Business intelligence. Through this companies can adapt their marketing campaign towards the customers. The e-receipt helps to connect customers to their in-store purchases. Merchants can issue E-receipts using own mechanisms or use external services specialized on electronic payments. One of such providers is Square Inc. Ecoslips.com provides an integrated solution to retailers, payment providers and EFTPOS platforms to send digital receipts to consumer cell phones. They've come up with a unique architecture to automate electronic receipts receipts without the need to share any personal information or credit card tokens. Other companies are specialized in E-receipt aggregation allowing a consumer to see all E-receipts, in one place, for example WalletWizz Inc.

Possible ways of distributing the email receipts may be to send an [[e-mail]], an [[Mobile app|app]] or a [[website]]/[[Web application|web app]]. The general idea of the e-receipt remains the same, there are only different ways of distribution. There are many different companies that already offer their customers e-receipts. In the following part these different companies and technologies are compared and their pros and cons are discussed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7429">'''Employee voice''' refers to the participation of employees in influencing organisational decision making.    Because research and analysis have grown around the voice concept in a variety of disciplines, ‘employee voice’ has become an elastic term  meaning  somewhat different things to different policy, academic and  practitioner actors.  In the many disciplines that cover voice, such as human resource management, political science, economics, organisational behaviour, psychology or law, perspectives toward the concept differ.  Drawing on Dundon et al. voice can be seen with different lenses. First, voice is an articulation of individual dissatisfaction or concern that aims to address a specific problem or issue with management.  Second, voice takes the form of collective organisation, where voice provides a countervailing source of power to management. Third, there is the role of voice as a contribution to management decision-making. Here the purpose is to gain employee input to improve work organisation and efficiency more generally, perhaps through quality circles or teamwork, or eliciting workforce engagement. Fourth, voice can be seen as an instrument for mutual gain, with productive collaboration between capital and labour increasing the long-term viability of an organisation and economic well-being of employees. The editors of the Elgar Handbook of Employee Voice &lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson A.Dundon ,Donaghey J and R.Freeman (2014) The Handbook of employee voice, Elgar&lt;/ref&gt; define employee voice as the ways and means through which employees attempt to have a say and potentially influence organisational affairs about issues that affect their work and the interests of managers and owners.  This definition combines a variety of voice mechanisms that analysts often group in separate boxes (e.g. involvement or bargaining; union and non-union). It allows for employer implemented Non-union Employee Representative (NER) systems as a collective form of voice, be it chosen to marginalise a union presence or to provide an alternative to union influence   In general, employee voice is about how employees are able to have a say over work activities and decisions within the organizations in which they work, regardless of the institutional channel through which it operates—whether through speak-up programmes, quality circles, teamwork, or collective negotiation.

Arguments for employee voice can be both moral and political as well as economic.&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone, S and Ackers, P (2015), Finding a Voice at Work? New Perspectives on Employment Relations, Oxford, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a wide range of mechanisms related to employee voice, and these may be direct or indirect, formal or informal, and power-centred or task-centred.  As well as trade union representation, voice may refer to a wide array of techniques including Empowerment, Employee Engagement and Teamworking initiatives.  In reality, many employers adopt a blend of voice mechanisms.  However, some employers may also wish to limit employee voice, believing instead that the best approach is for management to command and control the organisation. Equally, some employees may not want to have their voice heard, or may not want to express their thoughts.

In July 2013, an international workshop on the benefits of employee voice was organised by Dr Andrew R Timming, an employee voice scholar based at the University of St Andrews. The workshop, entitled, 'Strengthening Democracy at Work', brought together the world's leading employee voice researchers, including: Peter Ackers (University of Loughborough), John Budd (University of Minnesota), Tony Dundon (National University of Ireland, Galway), Stewart Johnstone (University of Newcastle), Andrew Pendleton (York University) and Andrew Timming (University of St Andrews). Also present were several practitioners. The workshop was funded by the Scottish Universities Insight Institute and the Russell Trust. The first day took place in Glasgow and the second day was held at New Lanark. The workshop participants discussed the benefits of employee voice for employees, organisations and societies. In short, when employers give employees a 'say' in the strategic direction of the organisation, all three levels benefit.

== Informal and formal mechanisms ==
Employee voice is attained through both informal and formal mechanisms. Informal employee voice mechanisms include general conversation between employees and employers, email communication, employee feedback, social functions and meetings at the workplace. Employees can also influence corporate decision making through their actions, such as turnover and absenteeism&lt;ref name="McLean, P 2008"&gt;McLean, P (2008), Employee Voice, MGMT341, International and Comparative [[Human resource management|Human Resource Management]], [[University of Wollongong]], delivered 19 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal mechanisms include communication tools implemented by an organisations human resource department, such as employee surveys and [[suggestion box]]es. Some organisations promote employee voice through financial participation, such as share ownership and [[Profit sharing|profit-sharing]] opportunities. Employee consultative committees and representation through [[trade union]]s are also formal ways of ensuring employees are informed and are given a voice in decisions that affect their employment&lt;ref name="McLean, P 2008"/&gt;

== European Works Councils ==
In an international context, the role of employee voice varies immensely. The European model is fundamentally based on employee communication and consultation between employees and [[Management|corporate management]]. European [[Works council|Works Councils]] were introduced through the European Directive 1994 to accommodate these goals and provided employees with an opportunity to gain access to senior levels of their employers. The European model has required amendments to improve its effectiveness in managing employee voice and legal compliance&lt;ref&gt;Timming, A (2007), ‘European Works Councils and the Dark Side of Managing Worker Voice’, Human Resource Management Journal, Vol.17, Iss.3, pp.248-254&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1851">'''Fernand Collin''' ([[Antwerp]], 18 December 1897 – 11 December 1990), was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] businessman. He was president of the [[KBC Bank|Kredietbank]] from 1938 to 1973 and was also a professor at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]].

At the start of [[World War II]], Fernand Collin, together with [[Alexandre Galopin]] ([[Société Générale de Belgique]]) and [[Max-Léo Gérard]] (Banque de Bruxelles) were given a mandate to manage the Belgian economy during the war. [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] told them in May 1940 ''Nous vous confions la Belgique'' (E: We trust you with Belgium).

He was CEO of the [[pudding]] producing company ''Imperial Products'', which merged in 1968 with ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Devos Lemmens|nl}}'' into ''Continental Foods'' (it was sold to [[Campbell Soup]] in 1985). In 1962, he published an article in the [[Yale Law Journal]], where in a note on the ''Unit of Account'' he expanded on the idea of a [[Euro|European currency]] in order to ''revitalize the international money markets''.&lt;ref&gt;The Unit of Account: Enforceability under American Law of Maintenance-of-Value Provisions in International Bonds, The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 71, No. 7 (June 1962), pp. 1294-1315&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4598">The '''Global Network for Advanced Management''' is a collaboration of [[graduate school]]s of business that seeks to foster intellectual ties among [[business school]]s, students and deans&lt;ref name="GlobeandMail"&gt;[http://m.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/business-education/b-schools-create-alliance-to-prosper-in-a-global-market/article4170273/?service=mobile B-schools create alliance to prosper in a global market]. ''The Globe and Mail''.&lt;/ref&gt; from both economically strong regions and those on the horizon of [[economic development]]. It was founded by a consortium of 21 schools and launched on April 27, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advancedmanagement.net/#missionSub1 {{Failed verification|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Network has since expanded to include 30 member schools.&lt;ref name="advancedmanagement.net"&gt;http://advancedmanagement.net/whos&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The Global Network for Advanced Management was founded on the premise that enterprises need leaders who understand how markets and organizations work in increasingly diverse and complex contexts.&lt;ref name="GNFAM"&gt;[http://www.advancedmanagement.net/ Global Network for Advanced Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The network provides an organizational structure to facilitates connections among faculty, students, and alumni from diverse regions, cultures, and economies in different phases of development. Chief goals are the exchange of ideas, collaboration on [[data collection]], and the promotion of research in areas of interest to global [[commerce]]. Member schools share course materials, including [[Case study|case studies]] that incorporate specialized regional expertise.

==Activities==
The Global Network is a platform for innovation, hosting programs that include Global Network Weeks, which give students at network schools the opportunity to travel to another Network school for a one-week intensive mini-course that takes advantage of localized expertise;&lt;ref&gt;http://advancedmanagement.net/programs/network-weeks&lt;/ref&gt; Global Network Courses, online graduate-level business courses that connect students at member schools in group project work;&lt;ref&gt;http://advancedmanagement.net/programs/global-network-courses&lt;/ref&gt; and Global Network cases, teaching materials that examine business challenges from the points of view of at least two Global Network regions.&lt;ref&gt;http://advancedmanagement.net/cases&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the Global Network hosted two sessions at "Business + Society: Leadership in an Increasingly Complex World," a conference at the [[Yale School of Management]]. Deans and directors from nine Global Network schools discussed the skills they believed critical to leaders with moderator [[Margaret Warner]] in a panel entitled "Preparing Leaders for a Flatter World."&lt;ref&gt;http://som.yale.edu/our-approach/edward-p-evans-hall/opening-events/business-society-leadership-increasingly-complex-world/preparing-leaders-flatter-world&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty, deans, and students from three network schools participated in "Bank of Ireland: A Raw Case Study" with American investor [[Wilbur Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;http://som.yale.edu/our-approach/edward-p-evans-hall/opening-events/business-society-leadership-increasingly-complex-world/bank-ireland-raw-case-study&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the second eldest son of the [[Thammawattana family]], which had been involved in a long-running inheritance dispute; Hangthong became head of the family following his mother's death in 1990 and eldest brother's forced disappearance in 1991. He entered politics and was elected to the [[House of Representatives (Thailand)|House of Representatives]] in 1995, representing Bangkok for the [[Thai Citizens' Party]].

The family dispute came to a head with Hangthong's controversial death in 1999. He was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head in the family mansion with a gun in his hand in the early hours of 6 September. It was widely questioned whether the death was a suicide or a disguised murder, and Hangthong's brother Noppadol became a prime suspect. Multiple forensic investigations requested by the family's different factions resulted in conflicting outcomes, and it was not until 2010 that Noppadol was acquitted by the Court of Appeals.

==Life and career==
Hangthong Thammawattana was born to Arkom Chatchaianand and Suwapee Thammawattana, the second son out of ten siblings (including an elder half-brother and an adopted sister). He graduated in civil engineering from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and earned a master's degree in structural engineering from the [[Asian Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=ตลาดสดยิ่งเจริญ ขุมทรัพย์มรณะ |journal=ผู้จัดการ (Manager) |date=October 1999 |url=http://info.gotomanager.com/news/details.aspx?id=1188 |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered multiple marriages, and had sons Changwat and Tanthong Tumwattana.

Hangthong's mother Suwapee was matriarch of the Thammawattana family, who own and operate the [[Yingcharoen Market]] in the [[Saphan Mai]] area of Bangkok's [[Bang Khen District]]. The family fortune was the subject of a long-running inheritance feud which involved multiple assassinations, attempts and disappearances. Suwapee died in 1990, and her eldest son Therdchai (Hangthong's half-brother) was abducted and presumed murdered in 1991. Hangthong, the eldest surviving son, subsequently became head of the family.&lt;ref name="Insead"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bennedsen |first1=Morten |title=Dangers of Gun-based Succession Planning |url=https://knowledge.insead.edu/family-business/dangers-of-gun-based-succession-planning-4589 |website=INSEAD Knowledge |accessdate=29 July 2018 |language=en |date=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nanchanok" /&gt;

Hangthong entered politics and was elected to the [[House of Representatives (Thailand)|House of Representatives]] in [[Thai general election, 1995|1995]], representing Bangkok's twelfth district (at the time) for the [[Thai Citizens' Party]]; he was re-elected [[Thai general election, 1996|in 1996]]. By 1999, he had had arguments with his younger brother Noppadol Thammawattana, who accused Hangthong of appropriating family funds for his political career.&lt;ref name="Nanchanok" /&gt;

==Death==
On 5 September 1999, Hangthong, Noppadol and sister Malika Leelapan had met with a legal adviser to discuss the handling of the family estate. Noppadol was probably the last person to see Hangthong alive at the family mansion in Bang Khen, where they lived. At around 03:00 on 6 September, Hangthong's body was found in an armchair in Noppadol's bedroom, with a gunshot wound to the head and a .38 revolver in his right hand.&lt;ref name="Nanchanok" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horn" /&gt;

The police initially ruled the case a suicide. Several of the other siblings, however, refused to accept this explanation, believing that Hangthong was murdered as a result of the familial dispute. Younger sister Narumol had Scottish forensics expert [[Adrian Linacre]] weigh in on the case, and secured a second autopsy by celebrity forensics pathologist [[Pornthip Rojanasunand]], who was Deputy Director of the Institute of Forensic Science. Both reached conclusions that supported murder. Noppadol, however, also enlisted the opinion of the famous American forensics scientist [[Henry Lee (forensic scientist)|Henry Lee]], who supported the original suicide finding, and a third autopsy by the Forensic Association of Thailand also found that suicide could not be ruled out.&lt;ref name="Nanchanok" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horn" /&gt;

Noppadol was formally indicted on murder charges in January 2004. He was acquitted by the Criminal Court, which found Pornthip's testimony insufficient, in 2007. The ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeals in 2010. Noppadol also filed a complaint of ethical misconduct against Pornthip to the [[Medical Council of Thailand]], which put her on probation for publicly commenting on the case. In 2014, the remaining members of the Thammawattana family finally settled 48 outstanding court cases they had filed against each other in the family dispute.&lt;ref name="Nanchanok"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wongsamuth|first1=Nanchanok|title=Blood ran thick in long family feud|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/archive/423792/|accessdate=6 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Horn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horn|first1=Robert|title=Blood and Money|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,582484,00.html|accessdate=6 April 2018|work=Time|date=26 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Harmon Trophy''' is a set of three international trophies, to be awarded annually to the world's outstanding aviator, aviatrix, and aeronaut ([[balloon]] or [[dirigible]]).  A fourth trophy, the "National Trophy," was awarded from 1926 through [[1938 in aviation|1938]] to the most outstanding aviator in each of the twenty-one member countries and again from 1946-1948 to honor Americans who contributed to aviation. The award was established in [[1926 in aviation|1926]] by [[Clifford B. Harmon]], a wealthy [[balloonist]] and [[aviator]].

The awards are described by the Clifford B. Harmon Trust as:
:"American awards for the most outstanding international achievements in the arts and/or science of aeronautics for the preceding year, with the art of flying receiving first consideration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II and Harmon's death==
Prior to [[World War II]], the award was administered by the [[International League of Aviators]] (''Ligue Internationale des Aviateurs''), an organization founded by Harmon to serve as "an agent for Peace and National security."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

During the period the awards were in litigation (1945–1948), the American Section of the League awarded the International Aviator Trophy to three U.S. leaders in aviation. However, since the awards were not approved by other League Sections, the awards are technically invalid. Also, these three awards were given without consideration to the "art of flying" and the awards did not recognize a superlative aviation achievement, rather recognized American aviation industry leaders. President Truman's staff questioned the award to Alexander de Seversky, Secretary of the Air Force [[Stuart Symington]] stating, "he [de Seversky] did absolutely nothing to deserve it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award to [[Pan American World Airways]] President Juan Trippe in 1946 was the only one presented without debate.

Since 1997 or 1998, the [[National Aeronautic Association]] has been responsible for awarding the trophies. With the exception of the Aeronaut trophy, all are inactive.

The trustees wrestled with how to treat [[space flight]]. Bound by the court to offer only three trophies, the trustees first agreed that "feats of piloting in both earth orbiting or outer space vehicles will be considered for the Harmon Awards provided the vehicles are controlled by their pilots rather than from the ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Some aviatrix awards from 1980-1990 were awarded by the [[Ninety-Nines]] based on research performed by [[Fay Gillis Wells]]. This work was not coordinated with the NAA or Smithsonian.

The original awards were 24-inch-tall bronze statues.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20041205031139/http://www.nasm.si.edu/research/aero/trophy/TROPHYIMAGE/harmon.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;  The aviator trophy depicts [[World War I]] [[flying ace]] [[Raoul Lufbery]] launching a [[biplane]] set next to an [[eagle]] about to take wing. The statuette was created by sculptor Roumanbona M'Divani. The [[Smithsonian Institution]] acquired the aviator's trophy in [[1950 in aviation|1950]] from the Clifford B. Harmon Trust. The aviatrix trophy depicts a winged goddess cradling a falcon with outstretched wings. The aeronaut trophy was lost in Germany between May 1940 and October 1953 and was believed to have been sold as scrap.  The three-foot-tall, 150-pound statue of five aviators holding the globe on their shoulders was found in a junk store and subsequently given to the Smithsonian after the presentation of the 1952 awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The following is an incomplete list compiled from several sources. The Aeronaut, National and Astronaut categories have not been listed in a central location. The NAA and the Smithsonian Institution's [[National Air and Space Museum]] worked to assemble a complete list to be published in conjunction with the NAA's hundredth anniversary in 2005, however this project was not completed and it appears that the source documents for a period of awards were destroyed.

The ICIJ's most recent investigation is the 2017 [[Paradise Papers]], a cross-border, global investigation&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icij.org/blog/2017/971/icij-releases-paradise-papers/ global investigation]&lt;/ref&gt; that reveals the offshore activities of some of the world's most powerful people and companies.&lt;ref name="ICIJ_paradise"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icij.org/blog/2017/971/icij-releases-paradise-papers/|title=ICIJ releases new investigation: the Paradise Papers|date=5 November 2017|work=International Consortium of Investigative Journalists|access-date=5 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project involved 95 media partners and was based on 13.4 million leaked files.

==History==
In 1997, the Center for Public Integrity began "assembling the world's first working network of premier investigative reporters." By 2000 the ICIJ consisted of 75 world-class investigative reporters in 39 countries."&lt;ref name="publicintegrity_2000"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/files/manual/pdf/corporate/2000_CPI_Annual_Report.pdf | title=2000 Center for Public Integrity Annual Report | publisher=Center for Public Integrity | date=2000 | accessdate=7 April 2016 |pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

In February 2017, ICIJ was spun off into a fully independent organisation, which is now governed by three committees: a traditional board of directors with a fiduciary role; an Advisory Committee made of supporters; and an ICIJ Network Committee.&lt;ref name="icij_about" /&gt;

ICIJ was granted nonprofit status from US tax authorities in July the same year.&lt;ref name="icij_about" /&gt;

In 2017, the ICIJ, [[the McClatchy Company]], and the [[Miami Herald]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting]] "for the Panama Papers, a series of stories using a collaboration of more than 300 reporters on six continents to expose the hidden infrastructure and global scale of offshore tax havens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explanatory Reporting|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-category/207|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, the ICIJ won more than 20 awards for the Panama Papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/about/awards/|title=ICIJ's Awards|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global tobacco industry==
From 2008 to 2011, the ICIJ investigated the global tobacco industry, revealing how [[Philip Morris International]] and other tobacco companies worked to grow businesses in Russia, Mexico, Uruguay and Indonesia.&lt;ref name=lethal_legal_2014&gt;{{cite book | title=Lethal But Legal: Corporations, Consumption, and Protecting Public Health | author=Freudenberg, Nicholas |isbn=9780199937196 |work=Oxford University Press |date=21 January 2014|pages=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}}

==Offshore banking series==
The ICIJ partnered with ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[BBC]], ''[[Le Monde]]'', the ''[[Washington Post]]'', ''[[SonntagsZeitung]]'', ''[[The Indian Express]]'', ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' and ''[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]]'' to produce an investigative series on [[offshore banking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Pitzke | first = Marc | title = Offshore Leaks: Vast Web of Tax Evasion Exposed | url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/icij-journalists-expose-mass-web-of-global-tax-evasion-a-892505.html

In June 2011, an ICIJ article revealed how an Australian businessman had helped his clients legally incorporate thousands of offshore shell entitles "some of which later became involved in the international movement of oil, guns and money."&lt;ref name="icij_2011_ryle_taylor"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.icij.org/offshore/geoffrey-taylor | title=Inside the shell: Drugs, arms and tax scams | publisher=ICIJ | date=28 June 2011 | accessdate=6 April 2016 | last=Ryle |first=Gerard |series=Secrecy for sale: inside the global offshore money maze}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, the ICIJ revealed that relatives of China's political and financial elite were among those using [[offshore tax havens]] to conceal wealth.&lt;ref name=ICIJJan21&gt;{{cite news|title=China's elite linked to secret offshore entities|url=http://www.icij.org/blog/2014/01/chinas-elite-linked-secret-offshore-entities|accessdate=January 21, 2014|newspaper=ICIJ|date=January 21, 2014|author=Gerard Ryle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="nyt_2016_april_6" /&gt;

{{quote|[T]he Panama Papers reveal an industry that flourishes in the gaps and holes of international finance. They make clear that policing offshore banking and tax havens and the rogues who use them cannot be done by any one country alone. Lost tax revenue is one consequence of this hidden system; even more dangerous is its deep damage to democratic rule and regional stability when corrupt politicians have a place to stash stolen national assets out of public view.}}

In 2017, the German newspaper ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' obtained a "cache" of "13.4 million leaked files"&lt;ref name="ICIJ_paradise"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_2017"/&gt; regarding [[tax havens]], known as the Paradise Papers, related to the Bermuda-based offshore specialist [[Appleby (law firm)|Appleby]], "one of the world's largest offshore law firms."

== Data journalism ==
In the course of the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers investigations, ICIJ was challenged to learn about and implement various technologies to manage international collaboration on terabytes of data - structured and unstructured (e.g. emails, PDFs) - and how to extract meaningful information from this data. Among the technologies used were the [[Neo4j|Neo4J]] graphic database management systems and [[Linkurious]] to search and visualize the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/swedish-database-startup-neo4j-cracked-paradise-papers-2017-11|title=How a nerdy Swedish database startup with $80m in funding cracked the Paradise Papers|last=Ghosh|first=Shona|date=2017-11-08|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data-intensive projects involved not just veteran investigative journalists, but also demanded [[Data journalism|data journalists]] and programmers.

==Outreach==

The ICIJ is active on social media with a website, a blog entitled the 'Global Muckraker, '&lt;ref name=ICIJ_blog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icij.org/blog|title=The Global Muckraker|work=International Consortium of Investigative Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and a YouTube channel.&lt;ref name="ICIJ_about_2016"/&gt;

==Awards==
The ICIJ organized the bi-annual ''[[Daniel Pearl]] Awards for Outstanding International Investigative Reporting''.

The '''Central Business District''', commonly called '''Johannesburg CBD''', is one of the main business centres of [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]. It is the most dense collection of [[skyscraper]]s in [[Africa]], however due to [[white flight]] and [[urban blight]], many of the buildings are unoccupied as tenants have left for more secure locations in the [[Suburbs of Johannesburg|Northern Suburbs]], in particular [[Sandton]] and [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]]. There are significant movements to revive the area.

== History ==
The area that is currently the Central Business District has been the central area of Johannesburg nearly since its inception. Its central location in the city as well as careful planning led to it to be chosen as the best location for residential and commercial development, especially during the economically prosperous 1960s and 1970s. Many large commercial products were completed in this period, such as the [[Carlton Centre]], which is still the tallest building in Africa.

Under [[apartheid]], the Central Business District was classified as a whites-only area, meaning that black people were allowed to work and shop there but could not live there. Application of the [[Group Areas Act]] became very lax in the 1980s, among other things because courts were not able to handle all the cases, and when the Act was abolished even more disadvantaged black people moved into the City Centre, often taking over whole buildings by overfilling them with people that the previous middle class white tenants found unacceptable neighbours. 

This is not only true of previously established residential areas such as [[Hillbrow]] on the periphery of the CBD but also of former office blocks in the heart of the CBD, that were converted to residential accommodation as businesses fled the centre in the late-1980s and 1990s. A [[crime|crime wave]] swept through the city as businesses left the CBD, which made walking around the area dangerous. Many businesses and people fled the Central Business District and surrounding areas such as [[Braamfontein]], [[Hillbrow]], and [[Yeoville]] for more secured houses or offices in the Northern Suburbs. By the late 1990s, the Central Business District was a no-go zone and a virtual ghost town. All its former glory was lost, and the city was shattered by the loss of the [[Carlton Hotel (Johannesburg)|Carlton Hotel]]. The situation has improved since. The provincial government of [[Gauteng]] is based in the CBD as are several large banks. However, the city is still dangerous, and tourists riding on the sightseeing bus can still see all the illegal street traders, condemned buildings, and fenced off former hotels that are deemed "vibrant" and "cosmopolitan" by authorities, who are unwilling to assist in the improvement of the area.

== Gentrification ==
There have been significant movements to redevelop the city centre. The [[City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality|Johannesburg city government]] installed [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] [[camera]]s all over the Central Business District, which decreased crime dramatically.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Several historical buildings have also been developed and turned into [[condominium]]s, which developers hope will draw new residents to the area. The process of gentirification and redevelopment is ongoing as of 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="186306">The '''[[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC)''' is an [[United States|American]] [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] [[television network]] that originated in 1927 as the [[Blue Network|NBC Blue]] [[radio network]], and five years after its 1942 divorce from [[NBC]] and purchase by [[Edward J. Noble]] (adopting its current name the following year), expanded into television in April 1948. Throughout its history, the network has many [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] and [[network affiliate|affiliated stations]].

This article is a table listing of former ABC stations, arranged alphabetically by state, and based on the station's [[city of license]] as well as its [[media market|Designated Market Area]]; it is also accompanied by footnotes regarding the present network affiliation of the former ABC-affiliated station (if the station remains operational) and the current ABC affiliates in each of the listed markets, as well as any other notes including the reasons behind each station's disaffiliation from the network. There are links to and articles on each of the stations, describing their histories, local programming and technical information, such as broadcast frequencies.

The station's advertised channel number follows the call letters. In most cases, this is their [[virtual channel]] ([[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]]) number, which may match the channel allocation that the station originally broadcast on during its prior affiliation with the network.

==Former affiliate stations==

[[Toothpaste]] is used to promote [[oral hygiene]]; it functions as an abrasive agent that helps to remove [[dental plaque]] and food from the teeth, works to suppress [[halitosis]], and delivers active ingredients such as [[fluoride]] or [[xylitol]] to the teeth and gums to help prevent [[tooth decay]] (cavity) and gum disease ([[gingivitis]]).&lt;ref name="ADA-toothpaste"&gt;American Dental Association Description of Toothpaste{{cite web| title=Toothpaste| url=http://www.ada.org/1322.aspx| date=April 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael "Mikha" Reisser''' ({{Lang-he|מיכאל רייסר}}, 26 April 1946 &amp;ndash; 27 October 1988) was an [[Israel]]i politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Likud]] between 1981 and his death in 1988.

==Biography==
Born in [[Tel Aviv]] towards the end of the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate era]], Reisser was educated at the Shalva [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], before studying sociology and labour studies at [[Tel Aviv University]]. He became chairman of the university's student union in 1970, and from 1971 until 1977 chaired the secretariat of the [[Herut]] young guard.

In 1978 he started working as a consultant to the [[Immigrant Absorption Minister of Israel|Minister of Immigrant Absorption]] and [[Housing and Construction Minister of Israel|Minister of Housing]]. He went on to become deputy director of the Housing Ministry and director of the Israel Builders Association from 1979 until 1981. He also became chairman of the board at HaYekev in 1981, and was a member of the board at the Ata textiles company from 1981 until 1984.

From 1979 until 1980 he chaired Herut's Organisation Department. The following year he was [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|elected]] to the Knesset on the Likud list (then an alliance of Herut and other right-wing parties). He was re-elected in [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984]], and became chairman of the House Committee. However, on 26 October 1988, he was fatally injured in a car crash whilst on a journey to [[Jerusalem]] for a photoshoot for the [[Israeli legislative election, 1988|upcoming elections]] when his car crashed into another car being driven by future politician [[Dalia Itzik]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART/863/595.html Itzik power] NRG, 4 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and died of his injuries the following day. His Knesset seat was taken by [[David Mor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mkindexbyknesset_eng.asp?knesset=11 Knesset Members in the Eleventh Knesset] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;

Reisser was married with a son and twin daughters. All three of his children became religious after his death. 

[[Beitar Avraham Be'er Sheva F.C.|Beitar Avraham Be'er Sheva's]] stadium, a junior high school and winery club in [[Rishon LeZion]], streets in [[Lod]] and [[Ramla]], and a playground in [[Nahariya]] are named after him.

[[File:もったいない (5305643094).jpg|thumb|''Mottainai'' written on a truck, followed by the sentence "I strive towards [[zero emission]]"]]

'''''Mottainai''''' is a term of Japanese origin that has been used by environmentalists.  The term in Japanese conveys a sense of regret over waste; the exclamation "''Mottainai!'' can translate as "What a waste!"  Japanese environmentalists have used the term to encourage people to "[[Waste hierarchy|reduce, reuse and recycle]]", and [[Kenya]]n environmentalist [[Wangari Maathai]] used the term at the [[United Nations]] as a slogan to promote environmental protection.

== Usage and translation ==

''Mottainai'' is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term conveying a sense of [[regret]] concerning [[waste]].&lt;ref name="daijirin"&gt;[https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%8B%BF%E4%BD%93%E7%84%A1%E3%81%84-645881#E5.A4.A7.E8.BE.9E.E6.9E.97.20.E7.AC.AC.E4.B8.89.E7.89.88 Daijirin Japanese dictionary 2nd ed.] (Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; The expression "Mottainai!" can be uttered alone as an exclamation when something useful, such as food or time, is wasted, meaning roughly "what a waste!" In addition to its primary sense of "wastefulness", the word is also used to mean "impious; irreverent" or "more than one deserves".&lt;ref&gt;Masuda, K: Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary, page 1139. Kenkyusha Ltd., 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mottainai'' in Japanese refers both to physical waste and to wasteful action.  MacQuillan and Preston propose a more elaborate translation that conveys a sense of value and worthiness as "do not destroy (or lay waste to) that which is worthy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alan G. MacQuillan |author2=Ashley L. Preston |title=Globally and Locally: Seeking a Middle Path to Sustainable Development |year=1998 |publisher=University Press of America |location= |isbn=0761811265 |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Modern Japanese environmentalism ===
In November 2002, the English-language, Japan-based magazine ''[[Look Japan]]'' ran a cover story entitled "Restyling Japan: Revival of the 'Mottainai' Spirit", documenting the motivation amongst volunteers in a "toy hospital" in Japan to "develop in children the habit of looking after their possessions," the re-emergence of repair shops specializing in repairing household appliances or children's clothes, the recycling of [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottles and other materials, the collection of waste [[edible oil]], and more generally the efforts to stop the trend of throwing away everything that can no longer be used, i.e. the efforts of reviving "the spirit of ''mottainai''".&lt;ref name="look-japan-2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chiba |first=Hitoshi |date=November 2002 |title=Restyling Japan: Revival of the "Mottainai" Spirit |journal=[[Look Japan]] |url=http://www.lookjapan.com/LBcoverstory/02NovCS.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405084940/http://www.lookjapan.com/LBcoverstory/02NovCS.htm |archivedate=April 5, 2004 |accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that context, Hitoshi Chiba, the author, described ''mottainai'' as follows:

{{cquote|We often hear in Japan the expression 'mottainai', which loosely means 'wasteful' but in its full sense conveys a feeling of awe and appreciation for the gifts of nature or the sincere conduct of other people. There is a trait among Japanese people to try to use something for its entire effective life or continue to use it by repairing it. In this caring culture, people will endeavor to find new homes for possessions they no longer need. The 'mottainai' principle extends to the dinner table, where many consider it rude to leave even a single grain of rice in the bowl. The concern is that this traditional trait may be lost.&lt;ref name="look-japan-2002"/&gt;}}

A modern observance that practices mottainai{{clarify|reason=no meaning to "practising" wasteful|date=March 2018}} is the yearly festival of [[Hari-Kuyō]], or the Festival of Broken Needles.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

At the Opening Ceremony of the Science and Technology in Society Forum in 2005, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi stated: "In Japan, there has long been a spirit characterized by the word ''mottainai'', which could be translated as 'don't waste what is valuable'."&lt;ref name=Koizumi2005&gt;{{cite web|url=https://japan.kantei.go.jp/koizumispeech/2005/09/11press_e.html|title=Speeches and Statements by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi|website=japan.kantei.go.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use by Wangari Maathai===
[[Image:Wangari Maathai portrait by Martin Rowe.jpg|thumb|upright|Nobel Prize winner [[Wangari Maathai]] has used the word ''mottainai'' in an environmental protection campaign]]

At a session of the [[United Nations]], [[Kenyan]] environmentalist [[Wangari Maathai]] introduced the word ''mottainai'' as a slogan for environmental protection.&lt;ref name=JAS2014&gt;{{cite journal|

The '''Peso problem''' in finance is a problem which arises when "the possibility that some infrequent or unprecedented event may occur affects asset prices". The difficulty or impossibility of predicting such an event creates problems in modeling the economy and financial markets by using the past.&lt;ref name=fedPhil&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sill|first1=Keith|title=Understanding Asset Values: Stock Prices, Exchange Rates, And the "Peso Problem"|url=https://www.phil.frb.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/business-review/2000/september-october/brso00ks.pdf|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is useful in various contexts, in particular, in analyzing the [[Forward premium anomaly]].&lt;ref name=fedPhil /&gt;

== History ==
The precise origin of the term is unknown, but it is generally attributed to [[Milton Friedman]]. Mexico in the 1970s had pegged the [[Mexican peso]] to the [[US Dollar]], a peg which had held for more than 20 years. Friedman noted the large gap between the interest rate on Mexican bank deposits and the interest rate on comparable US bank deposits.  Friedman reasoned that interest differential reflected concern in the market that the peso would be devalued. This was eventually realized in 1976 when the peso, allowed to float, fell 46 percent.&lt;ref name=fedPhil /&gt;

Since the currency value had been pegged for a long time, the differential in interest rate looked like an anomaly or flaw in financial markets - an investor could exploit the difference by simple currency conversion and make a profit. The anomaly could be explained once the possibility of a large drop in the value of the peso is admitted.

The empirical work first discussing this was by [[Kenneth Rogoff]] in 1977 which was part of his PhD dissertation. The first treatment in academic literature was by Krasker in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krasker|first1=WS|title=The `peso problem' in testing the efficiency of forward exchange markets|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|date=1980|volume=6|issue=2|pages=269–276|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/moneco/v6y1980i2p269-276.html|accessdate=13 October 2015|doi=10.1016/0304-3932(80)90031-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was rated the 70th richest Canadian by ''[[Canadian Business Magazine]]'' in 2009 with a net worth of $817 million &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirbyson |first=Geoff |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/manitobans-make-magazines-rich-100-list-70447987.html |title=Manitobans make magazine's Rich 100 list |publisher=Winnipeg Free Press |date=2009-11-19 |accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but he is not shown on the Canadian Business ranking of the 100 wealthiest individuals and families in Canada 2018 list [https://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/richest-people/100-richest-canadians-complete-list/]

==Early life and education==

Nygård was born in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] in 1943. His parents were Eeli and Hilkka Nygård, bakers who immigrated to [[Canada]] in 1952, settling at first in [[Deloraine, Manitoba]] (where [[Nygård Park]] would later be named in his honour in 2002). They moved shortly after to [[Winnipeg]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www4.nygard.com/uploadedFiles/News/YEAR_2010/News_2010/full_HilkkaNygard_new.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, he graduated from the [[University of North Dakota]] with a business degree.&lt;ref&gt;http://www4.nygard.com/scf/News2003.aspx?id=357&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Outstanding Alumni"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.innovators.net/innovators/public_html/about_the_center/entrepreneur_hall.html |title= North Dakota Entrepreneur Hall of Fame |publisher= innovators.net |accessdate= 12 July 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110429024652/http://www.innovators.net/innovators/public_html/about_the_center/entrepreneur_hall.html |archive-date= 2011-04-29 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Entrepreneur Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.innovators.net/innovators/public_html/about_the_center/entrepreneur_awards.html |title= Entrepreneur Awards |publisher= innovators.net |accessdate= 12 July 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110701145531/http://www.innovators.net/innovators/public_html/about_the_center/entrepreneur_awards.html |archive-date= 2011-07-01 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tan Jay==
On December 1, 1967, Nygård started working as sales manager for a new jeans line of a woman’s clothing manufacturer Jacob Fashions . A few weeks later Nygård used his life [[savings]] of $8,000 and an additional [[loan]] to purchase 20% of the company from the founder Nathan Jacob. A few years later, Nygård bought the rest of the company from Jacobs daughters and renamed it Tan Jay.[http://jonesbahamas.com/the-opportunity-that-led-to-a-fortune/]

Nygård apparel manufacturing company was founded in 1967 in [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba.  Its Canada headquarters is now in [[Toronto]], Ontario with its world headquarters in [[Times Square]], [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.nygard.com/company-profile/?ID=31&amp;Folder_id=14 |title=Nygard International Company Profile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nygård's fashion concept retail store opened in [[Times Square]] in [[Manhattan]] on Friday, November 6, 2009.

==Nygård Cay==

In 1987, Nygård built a {{convert|150000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} compound at [[Lyford Cay]] in the Bahamas.  It was partly destroyed by a fire on November 10, 2009.&lt;ref name="nygard_cay_fire"&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/Fire-destroys-Nygards-Bahamas-compound-69911722.html "Fire destroys Nygard's Bahamas compound"], [[Winnipeg Free Press]], November 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Cay is inspired by the [[Mayan civilization]]’s architecture. One of the major buildings is a 32,000 ft&lt;sup&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;grand-hall with a 100,000&amp;nbsp;lb glass ceiling.&lt;ref name="DTProfile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unusualvillarentals.com/caribbean/bahamas/nygard/|title=Nygård Cay|publisher=unusualvillarentals.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626100416/http://www.unusualvillarentals.com/caribbean/bahamas/nygard/|archive-date=2010-06-26|dead-url=yes|accessdate=28 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 2010 Peter Nygard announced he was planning a $50 million renovation of Nygård Cay, which would take two years to complete and repair the damage and employ 200 construction workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenassauguardian.com/bixex/325682364938194.php|title=Nygard pledges 50 million comeback|publisher=[[List of newspapers in the Bahamas|The Nassau Guardian]]|accessdate=June 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627081222/http://www.thenassauguardian.com/bixex/325682364938194.php|archive-date=2010-06-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune242.com/searchresults/16082010_nkn-nygard-no-license_news_pg1|title=Nygard Cay is not licensed as commercial property|publisher=The Nassau Tribune|date=August 16, 2010|accessdate=August 31, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822030630/http://www.tribune242.com/searchresults/16082010_nkn-nygard-no-license_news_pg1|archive-date=2010-08-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But a letter from the Bahamian prime minister's office rejected his construction application, citing the improper expansion of his property through intentional accretion of land over the seabed.

On September 28, 2018 Nygård Cay was seized by the Supreme Court of the Bahamas as part of a legal battle surrounding Nygard’s efforts to dredge the sea floor around the estate [https://theworldnews.net/ca-news/peter-nygard-locked-out-of-his-luxury-home-in-bizarre-bahamas-feud]

==Charity==
Nygård has supported the [[Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnwtelbec.com/en/releases/archive/September2007/30/c6818.html?view=print |title=$26.5 million Raised Nationwide as Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation CIBC Run for the Cure Celebrates Sweet Sixteen |publisher=Cnwtelbec.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nygård has been a longtime sponsor of amateur sports in the Bahamas. In June 2010, is the main sponsor of [[Amateur Boxing Federation of the Bahamas]]' team for Continental Elite Boxing Championships Invitation only event slated for June 13–19 in [[Quito]], Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune242.com/sports/06012010_Nygardsponsorship_sports|title=Nygard sponsoring team for 'invitation only' amateur boxing event|publisher=The Tribune|date=June 1, 2010|accessdate=June 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717100937/http://www.tribune242.com/sports/06012010_Nygardsponsorship_sports|archive-date=2011-07-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington Miller, the president of the [[Bahamas Olympic Committee]], said Nygård has contributed significantly to the Amateur Boxing Association of the Bahamas and their Olympic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune242.com/sports/03292011_Gibsonhonored_sports|title=Nygard to sponsor Exuma regatta|publisher=The Tribune|date=March 29, 2011|accessdate=April 13, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315023708/http://www.tribune242.com/sports/03292011_Gibsonhonored_sports|archive-date=2012-03-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Nygård held the "2011 National Family Island Regatta" at Nygård Cay, which included a press conference to honor Bahamian musician "King" [[Eric Gibson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonesbahamas.com/news/123/ARTICLE/22793/2011-03-28.html|title=Nygard Does It Again, Sponsors National F.I.

==Lawsuits==
Nygård has been accused of [[Abuse|abusive]] labor practices, [[tax evasion]], [[sexual harassment]] and [[rape]].&lt;ref name="FalkenbergForbes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Nygard Answers to No One|last=Falkenberg|first=Kai|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/1206/features-peter-nygard-sexual-harassment-answers-to-no-one.html#52f40c70bc9b|date=November 18, 2010|publisher=Forbes Media LLC|access-date=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1978, Nygård's takeover of a sportswear designer's business in New York City led to a 12-year legal battle in New York federal court.&lt;ref name="FalkenbergForbes"/&gt;
*In 1980, the ''Free Press'' wrote that Nygård was charged with the rape of an 18-year-old girl by Winnipeg authorities. Later those charges were dropped.&lt;ref name="FalkenbergForbes"/&gt;
*Nygård [[Settlement (litigation)|settled]] sexual harassment complaints by three former employees in Manitoba in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="FalkenbergForbes"/&gt;
*In 1999, Nygård sued [[Linda Brava|Linda Lampenius]] for defamation when she claimed that he hired lookalikes for his [[Oscar party]] and "defrauded the entertainment industry and international press". The case was settled with Lampenius printing an apology in the Finnish press.&lt;ref name="FalkenbergForbes"/&gt;
*In 2003, Nygård was sued in Florida by an American couple who claimed he deceived them into accepting jobs as managers of his Bahamas estate. The case was settled in 2007.&lt;ref name="FalkenbergForbes"/&gt;
*In 2006, Canadian tax authorities claimed Nygård underreported $15&amp;nbsp;million in taxes. Nygård argued that he severed residential ties with Canada in 1975; he was ultimately subject to taxes on an unreported $2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="FalkenbergForbes"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 2007 with a bit of irritation over runoff has escalated to a battle royal encompassing no fewer than 16 [[Legal action|legal actions]] between Nygård and [[Louis Bacon|Luis Bacon]] and their associates, in which both sides are claiming damages in the tens of millions of dollars and lobbing allegations of activities that include [[vandalism]], [[bribery]], [[insider trading]], [[arson]], [[murder]], destruction of the fragile seabed, and having a close association with the [[Ku Klux Klan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6224">The US [[FAA]]'s '''Pilot Proficiency Award Program''' (Wings) promotes [[air safety]] and encourages [[general aviation]] pilots to continue training and maintain proficiency.  All of this in an effort to prevent aircraft accidents. The program features two aspects, knowledge and flight.  The knowledge portion presents online courses to maintain or increase an airman's knowledge.  The courses are at a quality level found in college,  air carrier or military education presentations.  The flight portion provides an opportunity to practice and perform selected maneuvers to the standards found in the FAA Flight Test Guide for the certificate level you hold or choose to exercise. (Example:  A retired airline pilot with an Airline Transport Pilot certificate may elect to perform at the Private Pilot level for the purposes of satisfying the Wings Program requirements.)

The Program is available to all through the [http://www.faasafety.gov FAA Safety Team Web site]; knowledge provided through the program is free of charge.

==Proficiency phases==

* Basic
* Advanced—For those who wish to maintain a higher level of proficiency than required by the Basic level.
* Master—For those who wish to maintain the highest level of proficiency.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faasafety.gov/documents/Wings_Manual.pdf FAA Advisory Circular 61-91J] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225063055/http://www.faasafety.gov/documents/Wings_Manual.pdf |date=December 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FAA Order 8900.1,  Flight Standards Information Management System (FSIMS),Volume 5, Chapter 2, Section 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy program===
[[Image:FAA-Wings-P1.jpg|right|thumb|Phase 1 pin (discontinued design)]][[Image:FAA-Wings-P2.jpg|right|thumb|Phase 2 pin (discontinued design)]]
As laid out in Advisory Circular 61-91H,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faasafety.gov/about/AC61-91H.pdf|format=pdf|title=Pilot Proficiency Award Program|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|date=April 26, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; (obsolete, superseded by AC61-91J) the program offered twenty phases and offered you a twenty-year recurrent training opportunity. Participants were eligible for more wings every year after earning their first set, each added set marking progress. 

From the program's inception in 1996 until 2007, each of the first 10 phases of the program awarded a pin and a certificate.
:
* Phase 1 wings are plain [[Bronze (color)|bronze color]].
* Phase 2 wings are [[Silver (color)|silver color]] with a star added.
* Phase 3 wings are [[Gold (color)|gold color]] with a star and wreath.
* Phase 4 wings are gold tone and have a simulated [[ruby]] mounted in the shield.
* Phase 5 wings are gold tone with a rhinestone mounted in the shield.
* Phase 6 wings are gold tone with a simulated [[sapphire]] mounted in the shield.
* Phase 7, 8, and 9 wings are gold tone with the appropriate [[Roman numeral]] displayed within the wreath.
* Phase 10 wings are bright gold tone with the Roman numeral X and shield located within a ring of 10 stars.
Past phase 10, only a certificate is awarded.

[[Seaplane]] pilots who specify “seawings” on the proficiency award application get a distinctive set of seawings.

===Program updates===
[[Image:FAASTeamWings-New3.jpg|right|thumb|The new three pins offered by the FAA for the program|250px]]
The original Wings program was updated in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/safety/awards/wings/ FAA Website describing the changes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129052119/http://www.faa.gov/safety/awards/wings/ |date=January 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was replaced by a new program from the new FAA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faasafety.gov safety website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130012424/http://www.faasafety.gov/ |date=November 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This new program attempts to provide better standards for pilots getting flight reviews and training, adding the most common causes of accidents into the curriculum and providing set standards for maneuvers, instead of giving a minimum flight time to complete.

While the [[FAA]] does provide pins for completion of a level of the new Wings program under the updated program,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faasafety.gov/articulate/wings/default.htm FAA on-line tutorial describing new program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311133403/http://www.faasafety.gov/articulate/wings/default.htm |date=March 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has entered into a partnership with aviation insurer [[Avemco]] where is announced that Avemco will continue to sponsor the WINGS Pilot Proficiency Program by supplying all WINGS participants with WINGS lapel pins upon program completion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avemco.com/Page/NewsRoom-PressReleases-Article17.aspx Avemco press release]{{dead link|date=January 2013}} - AVEMCO ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR GENERAL AVIATION PROGRAMS FAA WINGS Program, AERI Research and Build A Plane to Benefit&lt;/ref&gt;  The FAA does, however, intend to keep track of a pilot's recurrent training and will be able to remind the pilot by e-mail if their training is close to expiring, requiring them to get a new [[biennial flight review|flight review]] or complete another Wings course via a website link.

On 24 September 2010 the program was further updated to include specific recognition for those sea-rated pilots who complete a phase of WINGS in a seaplane or amphibian plane. The [[Seaplane Pilots Association]] agreed to send a lapel pin to these pilots, and some insurance companies have started to offer "significant premium discounts" to members of the Association who complete a phase of WINGS in a seaplane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faasafety.gov/SPANS/noticeView.aspx?nid=2567 FAASafety.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306201957/http://www.faasafety.gov/SPANS/noticeView.aspx?nid=2567 |date=March 6, 2016 }} - "Sea WINGS" notice&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Quartier international de Montréal''' ('''QIM''') or '''Montreal's International District''' is a district of the [[Ville-Marie, Montreal|Ville-Marie borough]] of downtown [[Montreal]] roughly bordered by René-Levesque Boulevard to the north, Notre-Dame Street to the south, De Bleury/Saint-Pierre Street to the east and Robert-Bourassa Boulevard to the west. The ''Palais des congrès'' (Congress Hall) building lying just east of the district is also usually comprised in it. Constructed dispersedly between 1965 and 1985 in place of older colonial housing blocks, the district underwent major [[urban renewal]] as a [[central business district]] in 2000–2003.

|}

==Purpose==
The main purpose of the project was to restore the continuity of Montreal's downtown, broken by the gaping [[trench]] of the [[Quebec Autoroute 720|Ville-Marie Expressway]] since the 1960s, and thus to bridge the following areas:
* The existing downtown business district centred on [[Place Ville Marie]] (northwest);
* The [[Saint Laurent Boulevard]]/[[Sainte Catherine Street]] entertainment district and [[Chinatown, Montreal|Chinatown]] (northeast);
* The historic [[Old Montreal]] district (southeast);
* The [[Cité du Multimédia]] high-tech development district (southwest).

Other goals included the [[beautification]] of the [[built environment]], creation of elegant [[city square]]s, showcase of [[Quebec]] design and [[public art]], and stimulation of world-class [[real estate development]] at the heart of Montreal.

The completed area of 27 [[hectares]] (0.27 square kilometres or nearly 67 [[acre]]s), 30% of which are in the [[public domain]], spreads on an east-west axis above the Ville-Marie Expressway tunnels. It is bounded by [[Saint Urbain Street]] to the east, [[Saint Antoine Street]] to the south, [[University Street]] to the west and Viger Avenue to the north (plus [[Saint Jacques Street]] between [[McGill Street (Montreal)|McGill Street]] and [[University Street]]). The area is serviced by three stations on the [[Line 2 Orange (Montreal Metro)|Orange Line]] of the [[Montreal Metro]] and large portions of the [[Underground City, Montreal|underground city]].

==Components==
The QIM itself has five main components, from east to west:

[[File:Montreal - Palais des Congrès - 20050330.jpg|thumb|left|Palais des congrès, seen from Place Jean-Paul Riopelle.]]

===Palais des congrès===
{{main|Palais des congrès de Montréal}}
The Palais des congrès de Montréal (Montreal Convention Centre), the only building that was originally built over the expressway trench, was extended towards the west in the same manner, doubling in area while covering the first half of the western trench. The extension followed a similar design than the 1980s original, but with less concrete and more coloured glass, giving it a lighter appearance. The design, which included multicoloured panels and bright pink "tree" sculptures in the lobby, did not please everyone but is generally said to integrate well with the area. This section is connected to the [[Place-d'Armes (Montreal Metro)|Place-d'Armes]] Metro station.

===Place Jean-Paul Riopelle===
{{main|Place Jean-Paul Riopelle}}
[[File:Jp-riopelle-joute.jpg|right|thumb|''La Joute'' on Place Jean-Paul Riopelle.]]
The public square built over the trench at the same time as the Centre CDP Capital was named [[Place Jean-Paul Riopelle]] in honour of Quebec artist [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]] who died in 2002. His fountain sculpture ''[[La Joute]]'' was then moved to the square from the [[Parc Olympique]] in the district of [[Hochelaga-Maisonneuve]].

===Édifice Jacques-Parizeau===
[[File:QuartieInternational1.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Centre CDP Capital, seen from Place Jean-Paul Riopelle.]]
The [[Édifice Jacques-Parizeau]] is the Montreal regional office of the [[Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec]], the main investment arm of the Quebec government. Entirely suspended over the trench, the 13-storey building was the "enabler" and is now the centrepiece of the district, stretching between Jean-Paul Riopelle and Victoria squares. Despite its strong architectural qualities, construction was marked by opposition to the huge cost overruns of an already very expensive structure, at the same time as the CDP was losing taxpayers' money from questionable investments made during the [[dot-com bubble]].

The building integrates a new [[W Hotel|W]] [[boutique hotel]] at the west end on Victoria Square, as well as headquarters of two international organisations: International Council of Graphic Design Associations (Icograda) and the International Council of Societies of Industries Design (Icsid).&lt;ref&gt;{{URL|http://www.icsid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria Square===
{{main| Victoria Square, Montreal}}
Once an empty space crossed diagonally by Beaver Hall and McGill streets, Victoria Square was restored to its original configuration, that of a tree-lined square between parallel avenues. Trees and benches were added, the statue of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] was reinstated, and special care was given to [[Hector Guimard]]'s [[Art Nouveau]] outdoor entrance to the [[Square-Victoria-OACI (Montreal Metro)|Square-Victoria-OACI]] Metro station. The square is now fronted on the east by the Centre CDP Capital and the [[Montreal World Trade Centre]], to the west by [[Tour de la Bourse]] and Place de la Cité internationale, to the north by the [[Altoria|Altoria/Aimia Tower]], and to the south by the [[Quebecor]] building, its outdated façade fully re-designed for the occasion.

[[File:TourDeLaBourse night.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Tour de la Bourse]] (Stock Exchange Tower) near Square Victoria]]

===Place de la Cité internationale and surroundings===
[[Place de la Cité internationale]], northwest of Victoria Square, is a complex that currently consists of the [http://www.icao.int/icao/en/hq.htm headquarters] of the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO). The modern 17-storey building, completed in 1995, has its main entrance on the west side on [[University Street]]. A taller [http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=135638 second phase] has been announced on the site for quite some time, to fill the void near Tour de la Bourse.

Northwest of Victoria Square is the [[Complexe Maisonneuve]], made of the two aluminum-clad [[Bell Canada|Bell]] and [[National Bank of Canada]] towers built in 1982. Neighbouring [[Place Bonaventure]], connected to the [[Bonaventure (Montreal Metro)|Bonaventure]] Metro station, marks the western boundary of the QIM. A tunnel built under University Street between Place de la Cité internationale and Place Bonaventure finally connected the eastern and western parts of the Underground City which had previously been separated.

==Design==
[[File:ICAO World Headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|ICAO World Headquarters]]
Sidewalks were widened and re-paved in order to increase the pedestrian area by 40%. Open-air [[parking lot]]s were eliminated and replaced with 1,300 new parking spaces added under the Palais des Congrès, Place Jean-Paul Riopelle, and the Centre CDP Capital. Several trees were planted, and distinctive [[street furniture]] and [[street lighting]] was installed, including 22 backlit columns adorned with world flags in the median divider on University Street, welcoming southern arrivals from the [[Bonaventure Expressway]].

[[Clément Demers]] was responsible for overall project design, working with [http://www.daoustlestage.com Consortium Daoust Lestage] and Provencher, Roy et associés, with engineers [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611221214/http://www.genivar.com/ Groupe conseil Genivar]. Architect and urban planner [[:fr:Jean-Claude Marsan|Jean-Claude Marsan]] also consulted on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Libby |last=Ellis |title=Urban Inspiration |url=http://www.pmi.org/pathfinders/articles/N06JAN28.pdf |work=PMI Network |publisher=PMI.org |date=January 2006 |accessdate=2008-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2005, the project had received 22 awards in 13 different domains, including the ''PMI Project of the Year 2005'' from the [[Project Management Institute]] of [[Philadelphia]]. The project's success played a part in the decision of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] and [[International Design Alliance]] to move to Montreal, joining the [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] and several other international organizations. Chef [[Normand Laprise]]'s world-famous [[Toqué!]] restaurant moved from its tiny [[Saint Denis Street]] location to the Centre CDP Capital on Place Jean-Paul Riopelle, putting the QIM on the international gastronomy map. The district has become a prestigious address for real estate development, with upscale housing built and under construction totalling approximately 1000 units as of 2005.

==Management==
The project was managed by the ''Société du Quartier international de Montréal'', a [[nonprofit organization]] created in July 1999 by the federal government of Canada, province of Quebec and city of Montreal, as well as the Caisse de dépôt et placement and the ''Association des riverains du Quartier international de Montréal'' (ARQIM). The initial budget for the project was [[Canadian dollar|CAD]]$76 million (approx. US$57 million); the actual cost was $90 million (US$68 million). According to QIM's management, more than half of the overrun resulted from additional work requested by the city, as well as additional expropriation costs. Total investment in the district from all sources was approximately $860 million (US$650 million) between 2000 and 2003.

==Future projects==
Current projects include the beautification of McGill Street south of Victoria Square towards Old Montreal. There are long-term plans to continue the covering of the Ville-Marie Expressway further east to the currently dilapidated [[Place Viger|Viger Square]] behind [[City hall|City Hall]], where the new land may be used for expansion of the future mega-hospital [[Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal]] to be built north of the expressway.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4564">'''Randall Rothenberg''' is a business executive, author, and former news and business reporter.  Since 2007 (with a brief interruption) he has been the president and CEO of the [[Interactive Advertising Bureau]], the trade association for interactive marketing in the U.S. In 2017 Patrick Dolan assumed the role of president at the trade association.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=39102011&amp;privcapId=7959663&amp;previousCapId=7959663&amp;previousTitle=Interactive%20Advertising%20Bureau,%20Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Before joining the IAB in 2007, Rothenberg was the Senior Director of Intellectual Capital of [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], where he oversaw business development, knowledge management, and thought leadership activities, and directed the award-winning quarterly business magazine strategy+business, Strategy+Business Books, www.strategy-business.com, and other electronic and print publications published for senior business executives by [[Booz Allen]]. He has also served as the firm’s CMO.

Prior to Booz Allen, Randall spent six years at ''[[The New York Times]]'', as the technology editor and politics editor of the Sunday magazine, the daily advertising columnist, and a media and marketing reporter. For 10 years, he was a marketing and media columnist for ''[[Advertising Age]]''.

In 2010 Rothenberg briefly left the IAB to become the first [[Chief Digital Officer]] of [[Time Inc.]], in what was reported as the first major personnel move by Time's new CEO [[Jack Griffin]].&lt;ref&gt;Nat Ives, [http://adage.com/article/media/time-names-randall-rothenberg-chief-digital-officer/147638/ "Time Inc. Names IAB CEO Randall Rothenberg Its First Chief Digital Officer"], ''[[Advertising Age]]'', December 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later, after Time fired Griffin, Rothenberg returned to the IAB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/first-mover-interview-randall-rothenberg-130609 "First Mover Interview: Randall Rothenberg.

[[File:U.S. Army advertisement - "Be All You Can Be" (May 1986).webm|thumb|U.S. Army TV advertisement from 1986 using the "Be All You Can Be!" slogan]]
'''Slogans of the [[United States Army]]''' changed rarely in the 20th century, relative to the 21st.

==World War I==
'''"I Want YOU for US Army"''' featured on a poster of [[Uncle Sam]] painted by [[James Montgomery Flagg]].

==1950s–1971==
'''"Look Sharp, Be Sharp, Go Army!"''' was a recruiting slogan in the 1950s and 1960s. [[The Big Picture (TV series)|The Big Picture]], public announcements on broadcast television, and highway roadway signs advertised the slogan during a time of a national draft of young men 18 to 34 years of age. The advantage of volunteering for service as opposed to being drafted was the option to choose which career field you wanted to serve in along with the first unit and/or location of assignment.

==1971 to 1980==
'''"Today's Army Wants to Join You"''' was a recruiting slogan from the 1971 Volunteer Army (Project VOLAR) campaign, which was introduced as the country prepared to transition to an [[All-volunteer force|all-volunteer]] military. When N. W. Ayer &amp; Son, who were engaged by the US Army, believed they felt the army said "Today's Army is changing; we want to meet you half way", the firm came up with that slogan. General [[William Westmoreland]] asked "Do we have to ask it that way?" but agreed to the campaign. The slogan was replaced by "Join the People Who've Joined the Army" in 1973, which later evolved into "This is the Army."&lt;ref&gt;pp.141–142 Griffith, Robert K. &amp; Wyndham, John ''U.S Army's Transition to the All Volunteer Force 1868–1974'' 1997 DIANE Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

Slogan was written in 1971 by Ted Regan Jr., Executive Vice President and Executive Creative Director of N.W. Ayer, the Army's ad agency.
Regan also wrote the follow up slogan, "Join the people who've joined the Army."

==1980 to 2001==
'''"Be All You Can Be"''' was the recruiting slogan of the United States Army for over twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;AdSlogans.com - Wise Words/13 Archived 19 December 2010 at WebCite&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. N. J. Carter|Earl Carter]] (pen-name, E.N.J. Carter) working for the N.W. Ayer Advertising Agency as a Senior Copywriter created the “Be All You Can Be” theme line in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;“America’s Army”, Beth Bailey, Pages 191, 192&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2003, the U.S. Army awarded Carter its Outstanding Civilian Service Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://earlcarterawards.com/armypressrelease.pdf Archived 19 December 2010 at WebCite&lt;/ref&gt; Carter’s original concept sheet, with words “Be All You Can Be”, is now part of a permanent collection at the US Army Heritage Center Foundation.

==2001 to 2006==
[[File:Humvee with United States Army slogan.JPG|thumb|A [[Humvee]] [[Wrap advertising|wrapped]] with the slogan in April 2006]]
{{anchor|army_of_one}}'''"Army of One"''' was a relatively short-lived recruiting slogan. It replaced the popular "Be All You Can Be" and was replaced in 2006 by the new slogan "Army Strong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/21/AR2006112101295.html|title=Army Debuts New Slogan in Recruiting Commercials|last=Tyson|first=Anne Scott|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=2012-06-12|date=22 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the replacement, states [[Frank Luntz]], is that the slogan "Army of One" is contrary to the idea of [[teamwork]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luntz|first1=Frank|title=Words That Work|isbn=9781401385750|page=119|quote=Why did the U.S. Army jettison "be all that you can be," surely one of the most widely known taglines in the world, for the rather odd and uninspiring "An army of one"? Especially when an "army," by definition, is more than one person. While it is understandable for an organization like the military to want to individualize and personalize what it does, that's just not a believable or credible selling point.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown whether this slogan was taken directly from the poster for the 1976 [[Clint Eastwood]] film ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'', which had "An Army of One" under a drawing of the Josey Wales character.

==2006 to present==
[[File:Army Strong (2006).webm|thumb|The "Army Strong" advertising campaign's debut video, released in October 2006.]]
'''"Army Strong"''' is the [[Military recruitment|recruiting]] [[slogan]] that has been used for more than a decade by the [[United States Army]]. The composer of the music used in the Army Strong television commercials is [[Mark Isham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/-news/2006/11/09/568-the-making-of-army-strong/ The making of "Army Strong"]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Intelligent transportation systems'' usually refers to the use of information and communication technologies (rather than innovations in the construction of the roadway) in the field of road transport, including infrastructure, vehicles and users, and in traffic management and mobility management, as well as for interfaces with other modes of transport.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:207:0001:0013:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

== Photovoltaic pavement ==
Photovoltaic pavement is a form of pavement that generates electricity by collecting [[solar power]] with [[photovoltaics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Matej Lufčić|author2=Marina Maras|author3=Mario Vukelić|title=Energy Saving Design and Materials in Road Transport|url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/540022.Energy_saving_design_and_materials_in_road_transport.doc|accessdate=23 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524041829/http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/540022.Energy_saving_design_and_materials_in_road_transport.doc|archivedate=24 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parking lots, footpaths, driveways, streets and highways are all candidate locations where this material could be used.

In 2013 Students at the Solar Institute at George Washington University installed a solar panel walking path designed by [[Onyx Solar]], something they call ''solar pavement''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inhabitat.com/students-install-the-worlds-first-solar-pavement-panels-in-virginia/ |title=Students Install the World's First Solar Pavement Panels in Virginia &amp;#124; Inhabitat - Sustainable Design Innovation, Eco Architecture, Green Building |publisher=Inhabitat |accessdate=2014-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531095151/http://inhabitat.com/students-install-the-worlds-first-solar-pavement-panels-in-virginia/ |archivedate=2014-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar Road Panels===
The main purpose of solar roadways is to replace asphalt roads with Solar Panels which generate energy through the sun that can be used by local houses or businesses that are connected to the system from either the house’s driveway or the businesses parking lot. The panels will also increase the number of charging stations for electric cars if that station is connected to the solar roadway. Each panel is roughly 12’ by 12’ of interlocking panels that have their own LED lights that will be used as the road lines, and can also be used to spell out words like “Reduce Speed” or “Traffic Ahead” to help the flow of traffic.&lt;ref name = Ranjan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ranjan|first1=Rajeev|title=Solar Power Roads: Revitalising Solar Highways, Electrical Power and Smart Grids|journal=International Journal of Engineering Research and General Science|date=January–February 2015|volume=3|issue=1|pages=380–385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 3 layers that make up the solar panels:

1. The Road Surface Layer - The Road Layer is the High Strength layer that has the photovoltaic cells which attracts the sun’s rays, it has traction so vehicles don’t slide off the road, and it’s waterproof to protect the layers below.&lt;ref name = Ranjan/&gt;

2. The Electronic Layer - The Electronic Layers contain a mini microprocessor board that helps control the heating element of the panels, this technology can help melt the snow that lands on the panels so that hazardous road conditions will no longer be an issue in the more northern regions. This layer can sense how much weight is on the panels and can control the heating element to melt the snow.&lt;ref name = Ranjan/&gt;

3. The Base Plate Layer - The Base Plate Layer is the layer that collects the energy from the sun and distributes the power to the homes or businesses that are connected to the solar roadways. This will also be used to transfer the energy to cars as they drive over the strip to recharge the battery.&lt;ref name = Ranjan/&gt;

===Criticism===
''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine stated that solar roadways would produce less electricity than solar cells that are placed at an angle, and that less light would touch them because of shade, dirt covering the road, and cars blocking the sun from touching the panels. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2017/12/solar_roads_are_almost_definitely_not_the_future.html|title=What Is the Point of a Solar Road?|first=Neel V.|last=Patel|date=December 28, 2017|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have pointed out that solar roadways would be both more expensive, and less productive than more conventional ways of combining solar power with infrastructure, such as building shelters over roads and parking areas and putting traditional solar panels on the roofs; [[Elon Musk]] demonstrated that there is ample space in the US, apart from roads, to fulfill the power requirements of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.equities.com/news/elon-musk-demonstrates-why-solar-roadways-would-be-really-silly|title=Elon Musk Demonstrates Why Solar Roadways Would be Really Silly|last=equities.com|work=Equities.com|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smart pavement===
The Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) began testing out “smart pavement” at a rest stop outside of Conway, Missouri along historic Route 66 late in 2016. The pilot program currently covers about 200 square feet of sidewalk at the visitor center and cost $100,000 (Landers), largely subsidized by the Federal Highway Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cronkleton|first1=Robert A.|title=Missouri’s solar roadways to begin with sidewalk at historic Route 66 Welcome Center|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article93755517.html|accessdate=20 April 2017|agency=Kansas City Star|date=August 4, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511125201/http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article93755517.html|archivedate=11 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It’s all part of Missouri’s Road to Tomorrow initiative to find new innovations in their transportation infrastructure. Missouri wants to take advantage of these roadways to implement other, related technologies. The panels will heat the road and keep snow and ice from accumulating. They will also feature LED diodes that will increase the visibility of road lines. The LEDs would also double in helping prevent paint from inhibiting solar power generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landers|first1=Jay|title=Missouri to Test Solar Roadways, Smart Pavement as Part of Road to Tomorrow Project|journal=Civil Engineering—ASCE|date=2016|volume=86|issue=9|pages=30–31|url=http://cedb.asce.org/CEDBsearch/record.jsp?dockey=0352321|accessdate=20 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504172325/http://cedb.asce.org/CEDBsearch/record.jsp?dockey=0352321|archivedate=4 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panels have not had enough time to determine durability, energy efficiency, or cost effectiveness in a real world sense yet, so MoDOT has not reach any conclusions about feasibility and future application yet.

==Wireless vehicle charging==
{{See|In-road electric vehicle charger|Inductive charging|Wireless power transfer}}

The [[Online Electric Vehicle]] being developed by [[KAIST]] (the &amp;nbsp;Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) has electrical circuits built into the road which will power suitably adapted vehicles via contactless [[electromagnetic induction]]. A pilot system powering electric buses is under development. Germany's [[IAV#In-road electric vehicle charger|IAV]] is another company that is developing induction chargers.

===Electromechanical batteries===
Roadway-powered electric vehicle system is the patent held by Howard R. Ross. It has several components. The first of which is an all electric vehicle that would be fit with electromechanical batteries that accept a charge from the road. The road is the second component and would have strategically placed charging coils as to only charge the car when needed. These cars and roads would not require gas or solar power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=H.R.|title=Roadway-Powered Electric Vehicle System|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US5669470|website=Google Patents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowhere in the world is an invention like this currently implemented, and this is due to the cost of the infrastructure overhaul that would be needed to bring this patent into reality.

== Road markings ==

[[File:Sir Edgar &amp; Lady Leonora Speyer circa 1921.jpg|thumb|Sir Edgar &amp; Lady Speyer, {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1921]]
The '''Speyer family''' is a prominent [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] family of [[Germans|German descent]]. It can be traced back to Michael Isaac Speyer (1644–1692), who had briefly been the head of the Jewish community in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in 1691–92. The family originates from [[Speyer]] in [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], hence the surname.&lt;ref&gt;Prominent Families of New York, The Historical company, New York, 1897&lt;/ref&gt; In the late eighteenth century, the Speyers were the wealthiest Jewish family in Frankfurt, well above the [[Rothschild family]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leannelangley.co.uk/documents/BankerBaronetSaviourSpy.pdf Leanne Langley: Banker, Baronet, Saviour, ‘Spy’: Sir Edgar Speyer and the Queen’s Hall Proms, 1902-14]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business activities==
The patriarch of the family, Joseph Lazard Speyer, took over the ''Ellissen'' bank, inherited from his wife Jette Ellissen, and renamed it to ''J. L. Speyer-Elissen'' in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfact.com/auction-lot/yiddish-german-correspondence-between-two-jewish-102-c-3f284c3533 Yiddish-German Correspondence between Two Jewish-German Banks]&lt;/ref&gt; When their son, Lazard Joseph, got to the helm of the family business in 1838, the name was changed to [[Lazard Speyer-Ellissen]].

In 1837 Lazard Joseph's brother Philipp left Frankfurt am Main for [[New York City]] and established there in 1845 [[Speyer &amp; Co.|Philipp Speyer &amp; Co.]] (after Philipp´s death in 1876 renamed [[Speyer &amp; Co.]]). His brother Gustav (1825–1883) joined him to set up Philipp Speyer &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, Mira: „The History of Foreign Investment in the United States to 1914“, Harvard University Press, London 1989, S.99, {{ISBN|978-0674396661}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1861 Gustav formed [[Speyer Brothers]] in [[London]]. Early to realize the potential in [[North America]], the Speyer family was one of the top five issuers of [[United States]] and [[Mexico|Mexican]] railroad securities by the 1870s, their nearest rivals being [[Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.]] and [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leannelangley.co.uk/documents/BankerBaronetSaviourSpy.pdf Leanne Langley: Banker, Baronet, Saviour, ‘Spy’: Sir Edgar Speyer and the Queen’s Hall Proms, 1902-14]&lt;/ref&gt;

The London branch of the Speyer business, Speyer Brothers, was liquidated in 1922, when Gustav´s son [[Edgar Speyer]] left the [[United Kingdom]] for the United States. The Frankfurt branch, Lazard Speyer-Ellissen, was dissolved in 1934, shortly after the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'', the coming into power of the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Zwischen Marktwirtschaft und Dirigismus : Bankenpolitik im "Dritten Reich" 1933–1939 |first=Christopher |last=Kopper |location=Bonn |publisher=Bouvier |year=1995 |isbn=3-416-02529-6 |page=246 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Frankfurt family home, the prominent [[:de:Villa Kennedy|Villa Speyer]], was taken away by the [[National Socialist]]s in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pbof.com/villakennedy History of the Villa Speyer in Frankfurt, today a Grand Hotel]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1938, James Speyer retired and decided to close Speyer &amp; Co. in New York rather than let his name continue with the remaining partners. Therefore, the last of the three Speyer banking branches was liquidated in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lbpDH6likNAC&amp;pg=PT266 Susie J. Pak: "Gentleman Bankers - The world of J.P. Morgan", Harvard Studies in Business History (Book 51) 2013] {{ISBN|978-0-674-07303-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Speyer family belonged to Frankfurt’s patrons and made considerable foundations to support science and scientific education. Their funds provided the basis for the [[University of Frankfurt am Main]].

[[File: Valentin Dikul 2.jpg|thumb]]
'''Valentin Ivanovich  Dikul''' ({{lang-ru|Валентин Иванович Дикуль}}; born 3 April 1948 in [[Kaunas|Kaunas, Lithuanian]] SSR, Soviet Union) is a circus artist, head of the Russian medical and rehabilitation center of the [[Musculoskeletal disorder|musculoskeletal system diseases]]. [[People's Artist of Russia]] (1999).&lt;ref name="786-1999"&gt;[http://pravo.levonevsky.org/bazaru09/ukaz/sbor09/text09390.htm 7 июня 1999 года]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in Kaunas prematurely, weighing just over one kilogram. His father Ivan G. (1920-1950) was shot dead by bandits when he was 30 years old, and his mother Anna Korneevna (1925-1952), died at age 27 when Valentin was still in kindergarten.&lt;ref name="КТ"&gt;[http://www.peoples.ru/sport/heavy_atlete/dikul/ Никогда не сдавайся]&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised by his grandparents until he was seven years old. At the age of seven, he began living in orphanages, first in Vilnius, then - in Kaunas. At nine years old, he became interested in the circus and helped to put up the circus tent, cleaning the arena, looking after the animals, sweeping, washing the floors. 

At fourteen he began working as a motorcycle repairman. He also engaged in gymnastics, wrestling, weightlifting, balancing acts, acrobatics, juggling, stunts and invented tricks. He contacted the circus circle in Kaunas.&lt;ref name="КТ"/&gt;

=== Injury ===
In 1962, when Valentin was almost fifteen, he starred in his first act of air gymnastics at the Sports Palace. The act was performed at an altitude of 13 meters.&lt;ref name="КТ"/&gt; During one such performance, a  steel support cross beam suddenly broke, and Valentin fell from 13 meters. He spent a week in intensive care at the City Hospital and was then transferred to the neurosurgery department of the hospital. His final diagnosis was a compression fracture of the lumbar spine and traumatic brain injury, with many local fractures.&lt;ref name="КТ"/&gt;

=== Recovery ===
Dikul began to train. Lifted objects, stretched rubber bands and performed push-ups. He worked for 5–6 hours a day, but his legs did not work. Suffering from pain in the spine and fatigue, he performed strength exercises and studied the medical literature on the spine, gathering the necessary information. Doctors asked him to stop wasting time and effort, explaining that success is impossible. But he continued to exhaustion. He began to lift weights   small at first, then more and more increasing the weight, developing all the muscles of the back which he was able to. Then he had the idea that you need to move the inactive parts of the body as if they were healthy   a full cycle&lt;ref name="ПЛ"/&gt;.  Tied a rope to his feet, passing it under the headboard, which played the role of the pulley and then pulling it and moving the feet. Then he began using counterweight loads. Friends helped him build a system of weights and pulleys around his bed designed by Dikul. Eight months later he was discharged from the hospital with the first group of disability.&lt;ref name="КТ"/&gt;

A series of publications in the press provoked an avalanche of letters to Dikul with requests for help. In response, he would send them a package of instructions designed for medical rehabilitation. In processing a large amount of correspondence he was helped by his wife Lyudmila.

Many people confined to a wheelchair, saw it as their hope. Valentin spent three to four hours a day on advising people with disabilities.&lt;ref name="ПЛ"&gt;[http://paralife.narod.ru/1rehabilitation/volin/bragg_nishi_dikul_4.htm Система Валентина Дикуля]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Russian rehabilitation center for patients with spinal injuries and with consequences of infantile cerebral paralysis was opened in 1988   called Dikul Center.&lt;ref name="ПЛ"/&gt;
