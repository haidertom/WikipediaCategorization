'''AP Physics B''' was an [[Advanced Placement]] [[science]] course equivalent to a year-long introductory college course in physics. High school students studied [[Newtonian Mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]], [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], [[Fluid Mechanics|fluid mechanics]], and [[Thermodynamics|thermal physics]], [[wave|waves]] and [[optics]], and [[atom]]ic and [[Nuclear Physics|nuclear physics]] in preparation for a cumulative exam given each May. The course was non-calculus-based and involved [[algebra]] and [[trigonometry]] to solve various physics problems. &lt;ref name="CB0922"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_physb.html?physicsb|title=AP Physics B|year=2011|work=AP Central|publisher=[[College Board]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702141730/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_physb.html?physicsb|archivedate=2 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This course also helped prepare students for the [[SAT Subject Test in Physics]], which is also administered by [[College Board]].

Beginning in the 2014-2015 school year, the College Board has discontinued AP Physics B and replaced it with [[AP Physics 1]] and [[AP Physics 2]], making May 2014 the last administration of the AP Physics B exam.

==Exam==

The exam consisted of a 70 MCQ section, followed by a 6-7 FRQ section. Each section was 90 minutes and was worth 50% of the final score. The MCQ section banned calculators, while the FRQ allowed calculators and a list of common formulas. Overall, the exam was configured to approximately cover a set percentage of each of the five target categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/physics_b/topic.html?physicsb |title=AP: Physics B: Topic Outline |publisher=Collegeboard.com |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

According to the College Board web site, the Physics B course provided "a foundation in physics for students in the life sciences, premedicine, and some applied sciences, as well as other fields not directly related to science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/physics/ap-cd-physics-0607.pdf |title=2006, 2007 AP Physics Course Description |format=PDF |accessdate=December 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210223217/http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/physics/ap-cd-physics-0607.pdf |archivedate=February 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discontinuation==
Starting in the 2014–2015 school year, AP Physics B was no longer offered, and AP Physics 1 and AP Physics 2 took its place. Like AP Physics B, both are algebra-based, and both are designed to be taught as year-long courses.&lt;ref&gt;http://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/science/physics&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''African American Communication: Exploring Identity and Culture''''' is a 2003 book by [[Michael Hecht]], [[Ronald L. Jackson II]] and [[Sidney A. Ribeau]]. 

==Overview==
The book seeks to demonstrate why and how communication in interpersonal interactions between [[African Americans]] differs from that between [[European Americans]]. The authors argue that African-American identity, [[communicative competence]], language style and relationship formation and maintenance are strategies adopted in order to navigate a dominant European power structure than inhibits cultural authenticity and access to power.&lt;ref name=mcilwain/&gt; The authors' intent is to establish a starting point for research into the communication styles of African Americans and other cultural groups.&lt;ref name=greene/&gt; The major questions the authors seek to address involve the differences in communicative experiences that are unique to African Americans, how African Americans self-define culturally, and how African Americans perceive [[intercultural communication]].&lt;ref name=fears/&gt; The book concludes by presenting ideas and recommendations for future scholarship, including the necessity of a non-[[Eurocentric]] perspective on African-American identities.&lt;ref name=greene/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Writing in the ''Southern Communication Journal'', [[Charlton McIlwain|Charlton D. McIlwain]] criticized the book for failing to engage with disputes over the validity of racial differences in a [[postmodern]] world and for failing to explain the motivation behind the work or how it would add to understandings of intercultural communication or African Americans' communicative experiences. However, he also noted that the book "does include some discussion of a fairly vast amount of literature", and that it had the "potential to instigate debate over the [[ontology]] of human difference."&lt;ref name=mcilwain&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10417940309373258|title=Review of Michael L.

Fears in ''Mass Communication and Society'' wrote that "the authors do accomplish their goal of presenting a [[cultural analysis]] of African American communication" and that "the book, replete with information from diverse bodies of literature, is really a reader or guide that can be used by researchers seeking to better understand [[African American culture]] and communication styles, patterns, and even some basic history of African peoples in the United States."&lt;ref name=fears&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/S15327825MCS0603_6|title=Review of Michael L.

Arrington also described the original edition as "groundbreaking in
its interactional approach and its subject matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jls.sagepub.com/content/24/1/93.full.pdf+html|title=Review of Lisa J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5071">'''Alliesthesia''' ({{GreekFont|αλλoς}} (allós) - other, and {{GreekFont|αἴσθησις}} (aísthēsis) - sensation, perception ; ''French'' : ''alliesthésie'', ''German'' : ''Alliästhesie'') is a [[Psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] [[phenomenon]] (not to be confused with the [[pathology|pathologic]] [[symptom]] of [[allesthesia]]) that describes the dependent relationship between the internal state of an organism and the perceived pleasure or displeasure of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabanac|first=Michel|date=1971-09-17|title=Physiological Role of Pleasure|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/173/4002/1103|journal=Science|language=en|volume=173|issue=4002|pages=1103–1107|doi=10.1126/science.173.4002.1103|issn=0036-8075|pmid=5098954}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The internal state of an organism is in constant change, and any stimulus that can help to correct an error or need will be pleasantly perceived. For example, food will be more pleasant when hungry compared to when an organism is [[satiety|satiated]]. The sensation aroused therefore depends not only on the quality or on the intensity of the stimulus, but also on the internal state of the organism as sensed by internal [[Sensory receptor|receptors]]. The relationship between the [[Perception|perceptual system]] and [[physiology]] is [[subjectivity|subjective]] and studied by [[psychophysics]][[Subjectivity|.]]

== Forms of alliesthesia ==

* ''thermal'' alliesthesia: alliesthesia of the thermic perception (heat and cold), which contributes fundamentally to [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] [[thermoregulation]]. It is an aspect of [[thermal comfort]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parkinson|first=Thomas|last2=de Dear|first2=Richard|date=2014-12-15|title=Thermal pleasure in built environments: physiology of alliesthesia|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09613218.2015.989662|journal=Building Research &amp; Information|language=en|volume=43|issue=3|pages=288–301|doi=10.1080/09613218.2015.989662|issn=0961-3218}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* ''olfactory'' alliesthesia: alliesthesia of [[olfaction]] (sense of [[Olfaction|smell]])
* ''gustatory'' alliesthesia: alliesthesia of [[taste]] - see [[taste|primary tastes]] (sweet, salty, bitter, acid, [[umami]] and "[[calcium]])"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tordoff | first1 = MG | year = 2008 | title = Gene discovery and the genetic basis of calcium consumption | url = | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 94 | issue = | pages = 649–659 | doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.04.004 | pmid=18499198 | pmc=2574908}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* olfacto-gustatory alliesthesia or '''alimentary alliesthesia''': alliesthesia of tastes/flavors pertaining to [[food intake]]
* ''visual''/optic alliesthesia: alliesthesia of [[Visual perception|vision]]
* ''auditory'' alliesthesia: alliesthesia of the [[Hearing (sense)|sense of hearing]]

Each of these forms of alliesthesia exists in two opposite tendencies:
* ''negative'' alliesthesia: shift of sensation from pleasure to displeasure.
* ''positive'' alliesthesia: shift of sensation from displeasure to pleasure.

== Evidence ==

The phenomenon of ''alliesthesia'' was first described by the French physiologist [[Michel Cabanac]]. The first scientific publication from 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cabanac | first1 = M | last2 = Minaire | first2 = Y | last3 = Adair | first3 = ER | year = 1968 | title = Influence of internal factors on the pleasantness of a gustative sweet sensation | url = | journal = Communic Behav Biol Part A | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 77–82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was succeeded by over 40 publications in international journals, for example: 1970 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cabanac | first1 = M | last2 = Duclaux | first2 = R | year = 1970 | title = Specificity of internal signals in producing satiety for taste stimuli | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 227 | issue = | pages = 966–7 | doi=10.1038/227966a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1971 in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabanac|first=Michel|date=1971-09-17|title=Physiological Role of Pleasure|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/173/4002/1103|journal=Science|language=en|volume=173|issue=4002|pages=1103–1107|doi=10.1126/science.173.4002.1103|issn=0036-8075|pmid=5098954}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term ''alliesthesia'' was first mentioned in the annex of ''Physiological Role of Pleasure'' and was further elaborated in collaboration with the coauthor [[Stylianos Nicolaïdis]]. Originally, alliesthesia was demonstrated in [[experiment]]s with human subjects, and later confirmed in rats (''[[Rattus norvegicus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cabanac | first1 = M | last2 = Lafrance | first2 = L | year = 1990 | title = Postingestive alliesthesia: the rat tells the same story. | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003193849090123L | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 539–43 | doi=10.1016/0031-9384(90)90123-L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Autarky''' is the [[quality (philosophy)|quality]] of being [[Self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]]; the term is usually applied to political states or their [[economic system]]s. Autarky exists whenever an entity can survive or continue its activities without external assistance or [[international trade]]. If a self-sufficient [[economy]] also ''refuses'' all trade with the outside world then it is called a '''closed economy'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/c.html#ClosedEconomy|Deardorff's Glossary of International Economics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212072813/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/c.html |date=2007-12-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "closed economy" is also used technically as an abstraction to allow consideration of a single economy without taking foreign trade into account – i.e. as the antonym of [[open economy]]. Autarky in the political sense is not necessarily an economic phenomenon; for example, a [[military]] autarky would be a state that could defend itself without help from another country, or could manufacture all of its weapons without any imports from the outside world.

Autarky as an ideal or method has been embraced by a wide range of [[political ideologies]] and [[Civil rights movements|movements]], especially [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] creeds like [[African socialism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], [[council communism]], [[syndicalism]] (especially [[anarcho-syndicalism]]) and [[Left-wing populism|leftist populism]]. It has also been used in temporary, limited ways by [[Conservatism|conservative]], [[Centrism|centrist]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements, such as the [[American System (economic plan)|American system]], the [[Meiji Restoration#Centralization|Meiji Restoration]], [[social corporatism]], [[Juche]], and [[traditionalist conservatism]]. [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] movements occasionally [[Strasserism|claimed]] to strive for autarky in platform or propaganda, but in practice crushed existing movements towards self-sufficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42462895|title=Italian fascism : its origins &amp; development|orig-year=1938|author=De Grand, Alexander J.|year=2000|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803266227|edition= 3rd|location=Lincoln|oclc=42462895}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintained extensive capital connections in efforts to ready for expansionist war and genocide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45896166|title=IBM and the Holocaust : the strategic alliance between Nazi Germany and America's most powerful corporation|last=Edwin.|first=Black,|date=2001|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=0609607995|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=45896166}}&lt;/ref&gt; while allying with traditional business elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58452991|title=The anatomy of fascism|last=O.|first=Paxton, Robert|date=2005|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=1400033918|edition= 1st Vintage books|location=New York|oclc=58452991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autarky may be a policy of a state or other entity when it seeks to be self-sufficient as a whole, but also can be limited to a narrow field such as possession of a key raw material. For example, many countries have a policy of autarky with respect to foodstuffs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aic.ucdavis.edu/research1/BerlinSumner.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140120232431/http://aic.ucdavis.edu/research1/BerlinSumner.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and water for national security reasons. By contrast, autarky may be a result of economic isolation or external circumstances in which a state or other entity reverts to localized production when it lacks currency or excess production to trade with the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Computer Simulations of International Trade and Conflict | journal=Economic Interdependence and International Conflict: New Perspectives on an Enduring Debate | editor1=Mansfield, Edward D.|editor2=Pollins, Brian M.  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L53fR-TusZAC | page=333| isbn=0472022938 | date=2009-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Socialism in Provence, 1871–1914 | author=Judt, Tony | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeygBwAAQBAJ | page=263| isbn=9780814743553 | date=2011-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The word ''autarky'' is from the {{lang-el|αὐτάρκεια}}, which means "self-sufficiency" (derived from αὐτο-, "self," and ἀρκέω, "to suffice"). The term is sometimes confused with [[autocracy]] (Greek: αὐτoκρατία "government by single absolute ruler")  or [[autarchy]] (Greek: αὐταρχία – the idea of rejecting government and ruling oneself and no other).

== History ==

===Ancient and medieval===
Early state societies that can be regarded as autarkic include [[nomadic pastoralism]] and [[palace economy]], though over time these tend towards becoming less self-sufficient and more interconnected. The late [[Bronze Age]], for example, saw formerly self-sufficient palace economies rely more heavily on trade, which may have been a contributing factor to the eventual [[Late Bronze Age collapse|Bronze Age Collapse]] when multiple crises hit those systems at once.

[[Medieval commune]]s combined an attempt at overall economic self-sufficiency through the use of common lands and resources with mutual defense pacts against the depredations of the local nobility. Many of these communes later became trading powers such as the [[Hanseatic League]]. In some cases, communal village economies maintained their own debt system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/426794447|title=Debt : the first 5,000 years|last=David.|first=Graeber,|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|isbn=1612191290|location=Brooklyn, N.Y.|oclc=426794447}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a self-sufficient economy and to avoid reliance on possibly hostile aristocratic or business interests.

===19th and early 20th centuries===
Autarkic ambitions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3650099|title=The Populist moment : a short history of the agrarian revolt in America|last=Lawrence.|first=Goodwyn|isbn=0195024176|location=New York|oclc=3650099}}&lt;/ref&gt; can also be seen in the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist]] backlash to the exploitations of free trade in the late 19th-century and in many early [[Utopian socialism|Utopian Socialist]] movements. [[Benefit society|Mutual aid societies]] like the [[National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]] and [[Sovereigns of Industry]] attempted to set up self-sufficient economies (with varying degrees of success) in an effort to be less dependent on what they saw as an exploitative economic system and to generate more power to push for reforms.

Early socialist movements used these autarkic efforts to build their base with institutions like the [[Bourse du Travail|Bourse de travail]], socialist canteens and food assistance. These played a major role in securing workers' loyalty and building those parties into increasingly powerful institutions (especially in Europe) throughout the late 19th and early 20th-centuries. Through these cooperatives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/731911132 |title= The Guns of August: The proud tower |last= Tuchman |first= Barbara W. |year=2012 |publisher= Library of America |others= MacMillan, Margaret |isbn= 159853145X |location= New York, NY |pages=1046 |oclc= 731911132}}&lt;/ref&gt; "workers bought Socialist bread and Socialist shoes, drank Socialist beer, arranged for Socialist vacations and obtained a Socialist education."

Local and regional farming autarkies in many areas of [[Africa]] and [[Southeast Asia]] were displaced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37392803|title=Seeing like a state : how certain schemes to improve the human condition have failed|last=C.|first=Scott, James|date=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300070160|location=New Haven|oclc=37392803}}&lt;/ref&gt; by European colonial administrations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who sought to push smallholder villages into larger plantations that, while less productive, they could more easily control.

Communist movements embraced or dismissed autarky as a goal at different times. Some socialist communities like [[Charles Fourier]]'s [[Phalanstère|phalansteres]] strove for self-sufficiency. The early [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] strove for a self-sufficient economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40510540|title=Red victory : a history of the Russian Civil War|last=Bruce.|first=Lincoln, W.|year=1999|publisher=Da Capo|isbn=0306809095|edition= 1st Da Capo Press|location=New York|oclc=40510540}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[War communism|War Communism]], but later pursued international trade vigorously under the [[New Economic Policy]]. However, while the Soviet government during the latter period encouraged some international trade, it also permitted and even encouraged&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30841557|title=The making of the Soviet system : essays in the social history of interwar Russia|last=1921-2010.|first=Lewin, Moshe,|date=1994|publisher=New Press|isbn=1565841255|location=New York|oclc=30841557}}&lt;/ref&gt; local autarkies in many peasant villages.

Right-wing totalitarian governments that have claimed to strive for autarky have often pursued a very different policy in fact, just as some claimed to be in favor of socialism while killing socialists. In 1921 Italian [[Italian Fascism|Fascists]] attacked existing left-wing autarkic projects at the behest of large landowners, destroying roughly 119 labor chambers, 107 cooperatives and 83 peasant offices that year alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42462895|title=Italian fascism : its origins &amp; development|last=De Grand|first= Alexander J.|year=2000|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803266227|edition= 3rd|location=Lincoln|pages=31–33|oclc=42462895}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazi Germany]] under economics minister [[Hjalmar Schacht]] claimed to strive for self-sufficiency but pursued major international trade, albeit under a different system, to escape the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The regime would continue to conduct trade, including with countries like the United States, including connections with major companies like [[IBM and the Holocaust|IBM]] and [[Fanta|Coca-Cola]].

===After World War II===
Economic self-sufficiency was pursued as a goal by some members of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], such as [[India]] under [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NAYAR|first=BALDEV RAJ|date=1997|title=Nationalist Planning for Autarky and State Hegemony : Development Strategy Under Nehru|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24010467|journal=Indian Economic Review|volume=32|issue=1|pages=13–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tanzania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malima|first=Kighoma A.|date=1979|title=PLANNING FOR SELF-RELIANCE TANZANIA'S THIRD FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24498250|journal=Africa Development / Afrique et Développement|volume=4|issue=1|pages=37–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the ideology of [[Ujamaa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1024254210|title=State Ideology and Language in Tanzania : Second and Revised Edition.|last=Jan.|first=Blommaert,|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780748668267|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford|oclc=1024254210}}&lt;/ref&gt; and swadeshi. hat was partly an effort to escape the economic domination of both the United States and the Soviet Union while modernizing the countries' infrastructure.

Small-scale autarkies were sometimes used by the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]], such as in the case of the [[Montgomery bus boycott|Montgomery Bus Boycott]], where boycotters set up their own self-sufficient system of cheap or free transit to allow black residents to get to work and avoid using the then-segregated public systems in a successful effort to bring political pressure.

After World War II, [[Autonomism|Autonomist efforts]] in Europe embraced autarkic projects in an effort to craft anti-authoritarian left-wing spaces, especially influencing the [[social center]] and [[squatting|squatters]]' rights movements. Such efforts remain a common feature of Autonomist and anarchist movements on the continent today. The Micropolis social centre in Greece, for example, has gyms, restaurants, bars, meeting space and free distribution of food and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/984595655|title=Antifa : the anti-fascist handbook|last=activist),|first=Bray, Mark (Political|isbn=1612197035|location=Brooklyn, NY|oclc=984595655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1970, the [[Black Panther Party]] moved away from communist internationalism towards "intercommunalism," a term coined&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libcom.org/library/huey-newton-introduces-revolutionary-intercommunalism-boston-college-november-18-1970|title=Huey Newton introduces Revolutionary Intercommunalism, Boston College, November 18 1970|website=libcom.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Huey P. Newton]], "to retain a grasp on the local when the rest of radical thought seemed to be moving global." Intercommunalism drew&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thenewinquiry.com/the-havoc-of-less/|title=The Havoc of Less|date=2017-09-15|work=The New Inquiry|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206132434/https://thenewinquiry.com/the-havoc-of-less/|archivedate=2018-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from left-wing autarkic projects like free medical clinics and breakfast programs, "explicitly articulated as attempts to fill a void left by the failure of the federal government to provide resources as basic as food to black communities."

Autarkic efforts to counter forcible privatization of public resources and maintain local self-sufficiency also formed a key part of [[alter-globalization]] efforts. The [[Cochabamba Water War]] had Bolivians successfully oppose the privatization of their water system to keep the resource in public hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56194844|title=Cochabamba!: Water War in Bolivia|last=Oscar.|first=Olivera,|date=2004|publisher=South End Press|others=Lewis, Tom, |isbn=9780896087026|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=56194844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
Today, national economic autarkies are relatively rare. A commonly-cited example is [[North Korea]], based on the government ideology of [[Juche]] ([[self-sufficiency]]), which is concerned with maintaining its domestic localized economy in the face of its isolation. However, even North Korea has extensive trade with [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Syria]], [[Iran]], [[Vietnam]], and many countries in Europe and Africa. North Korea had to import food during a widespread [[North Korean famine|famine in the 1990s]].

A better modern example at a societal level is the autonomous region of [[Rojava]], the autonomous northern region of [[Syria]]. Cut off from international trade, facing multiple enemies, and striving for a society based on democratic confederalism and the ideals of [[Murray Bookchin]], Rojava's government and constitution emphasize economic self-sufficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A small key can open a large door: the Rojava revolution|editor=Strangers In A Tangled Wilderness|isbn=193866017X|location=United States|oclc=900796070}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by neighborhood and village councils, with property and business belonging to those who live in or use it towards that goal.

An example of an contemporary effort at localized autarky, incorporating the concept's history from [[black nationalism]], Ujamaa and [[African-American socialism]] and the civil rights movement, is Cooperation Jackson,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cooperationjackson.org/|title=Welcome|website=Cooperation Jackson|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a movement aimed at creating a self-sufficient black working class economy in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. The movement has aimed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/976416348|title=Jackson rising : the struggle for economic recovery and black self-determination in Jackson, Mississippi|others=Nangwaya, Ajamu,, Cooperation Jackson,|isbn=9780995347458|location=Montreal, Quebec|oclc=976416348}}&lt;/ref&gt; to secure land and build self-sufficient cooperatives and workplaces "to democratically transform the political economy of the city" and push back against gentrification. Cooperation Jackson also saw a gain in electoral political power when its involvement proved pivotal to the 2013 mayoral election of [[Chokwe Lumumba]] and the 2017 election of his son, [[Chokwe Antar Lumumba]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2053">The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers ([[STCW]]), requires that seafarers be provided with "familiarization training" and "'''basic safety training'''" which includes basic [[fire fighting]], elementary [[first aid]], personal [[survival techniques]], and personal safety and [[social responsibility]]. This training is intended to ensure that seafarers are aware of the hazards of working on a vessel and can respond appropriately in an emergency.

According to STCW, The STCW 95 Code requires that you take this 5-day course of instruction. This course has to be renewed every 5 years, or under certain conditions, you have to show that you have at least 1 year of service on board vessels of 200 grt or more within the last 5 years. The components generally includes a Fire Prevention and Fire Fighting (Basic Fire fighting) course of  2 days, a Personal Survival Techniques (PST) course of 1.5 days, a Personal Safety and Social Responsibility (PSSR) course of  half a day, and, First Aid / CPR (Basic First Aid) course of  1 day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.edumaritime.net/stcw-courses/basic-safety-training-bst Basic Safety Training Components]&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic Safety Training or BST is the starting point for persons seeking employment in the maritime industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edumaritime.net/washington/fremont-maritime-services-seattle Maritime Employment Requirement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic Offshore Safety Induction and Emergency Training or BOSIET is designed for marine personnel intending to work on an offshore installation in the UK maritime sector and forms part of a Common Offshore Safety Induction process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6325">'''Bitrate Peeling''' is a technique used in [[Ogg]] [[Vorbis]] [[Audio data compression|audio encoded]] [[streaming media|streams]], wherein a stream can be [[data compression|encoded]] at one [[bit rate|bitrate]] but can be served at that or any lower bitrate.
Bitrate Peeling is similar in overall effect to [[RealNetworks]]' technology called "[[SureStream]]", which basically creates a single media clip that contains multiple bitrates.  The purpose is to provide access to the clip for people with slower [[Internet]] connections, and yet still allow people with faster connection to enjoy the higher quality content. The [[Server (computing)|server]] automatically chooses which stream to deliver to the user, depending on user's connection speed.

{{As of|2005}}, Ogg Vorbis bitrate peeling existed only as a concept as there was not yet an encoder capable of producing peelable datastreams [http://wiki.xiph.org/Bounties#Ogg_Vorbis_Bitrate_Peeling].

An experimental implementation of bitrate peeling can be found [https://web.archive.org/web/20061017213607/http://www.vinjey.com/ogg_downloads.html here]. However, re-encoding files at a lower bitrate will preserve more quality than this experimental bitrate peeler.

The difference between SureStream and Bitrate Peeling is that SureStream is limited to only a handful of pre-defined bitrates, with significant difference between them, and SureStream encoded files are big because they contain all of the bitrates used, while Bitrate Peeling uses much smaller steps to change the available bitrate and quality, and only the highest bitrate is used to encode the file/stream, which results in smaller files on servers.

A related technique to the SureStream approach is [[hierarchical modulation]], used in broadcast, where severally different streams at different qualities (and bitrates) are all broadcast, with the higher quality stream used if possible, with the lower quality streams fallen back on if not.

===Lossy + Correction===
{{main|MPEG-4 SLS|WavPack|DTS-HD Master Audio|OptimFROG DualStream}}

A similar technology is to feature a combination of a lossy format and a lossless correction; this allows stripping the correction to easily obtain a lossy file. Such formats include [[MPEG-4 SLS]] (Scalable to Lossless), [[WavPack]], [[DTS-HD Master Audio]] and [[OptimFROG DualStream]].

===SureStream example===
A SureStream encoded file is encoded at bitrates of 16 kbit/s, 32 kbit/s and 96 kbit/s. The file will be about the same in size as three separate files encoded at those bitrates and put together, or one file encoded at the sum of those bitrates, which is about 144 kbit/s (16+32+96).
When a [[Dial-up access|dial-up]] user has only about 28 kbit/s of [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] available, the [[RealNetworks|Real]] server will serve the 16 kbit/s stream. If the dial-up connection is of higher quality, and maybe about 42 kbit/s is available, the server will automatically switch to the 32 kbit/s stream. A [[Digital Subscriber Line|DSL]] or [[Cable modem|Cable]] Internet user will be served the 96 kbit/s stream.
This looks good, but even though the user with 28 kbit/s can use a higher bitrate / higher quality stream (maybe 22 to 24 kbit/s), such thing can't be done with SureStream, unless the encoded file contains such a bitrate. This is where Bitrate Peeling comes into play.

===Bitrate Peeling example===
Contrary to SureStream, Bitrate Peeling requires only the highest bitrate to be used when encoding a file/stream, which is 96 kbit/s in this case. The obvious benefit is much smaller space on a server required by such a file.
An additional feature of Bitrate Peeling is a much finer tuning of available bitrate/quality.

If a dial-up user with 28 kbit/s available bandwidth connects to an Ogg Vorbis file/stream, the server will "peel" the original 96 kbit/s file/stream down to just below available bandwidth (in this case it would be around 20-24 kbit/s). 
This "peeling" process is different from [[transcoding]] because transcoding uncompresses the file and recompresses it (a computing-intensive process), whereas the peeling process "cuts the fat" by removing excess bits from the stream without using much processor time.

Aside from the obvious space-saving advantage Bitrate Peeling allows for smaller steps in the delivery bitrate (the end user will see the file in the highest quality possible for their bandwidth).

These benefits are only theoretical, as the only Vorbis peeler available is still in experimental state and produces file qualities inferior to what [[transcoding]] the higher bitrate file to a lower bitrate would.

==Comparison with other progressive encodings==
{{details|Lossy data compression#Downsampling / compressed representation scalability}}

Bitrate peeling is theoretically possible, and is implemented in some other formats, notably [[JPEG 2000]], [[JPEG]] progressive encoding, and [[Scalable Video Coding]].

The reason that it is not available in Ogg Vorbis is that current encoders do not organize the code-stream to have progressive accuracy, thus peelers cannot tell which data is more or less important.

[[Physics]] deals with the combination of matter and energy. It also deals with a wide variety of systems, about which theories have been developed that are used by physicists. In general, theories are experimentally tested numerous times before they are accepted as correct as a description of Nature (within a certain domain of validity). For instance, the theory of [[classical mechanics]] accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they are much larger than [[atom]]s and moving at much less than the [[speed of light]]. These theories continue to be areas of active research: for instance, a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics known as [[chaos theory|chaos]] was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727). These "central theories" are important tools for research in more specialized topics, and any physicist, regardless of his or her specialization, is expected to be literate in them.

==Classical mechanics==
{{main|Classical mechanics|Mechanics}}&lt;!-- where is this text to go? Jan2018: String Theory=This is a theory which combines the theory of general relativity and the quantum mechanics. This theory can predict any particle, small or large. Currently, it is under developmental phase and a lot has to be done.--&gt;

Classical mechanics is a model of the [[physics]] of [[force]]s acting upon bodies; includes sub-fields to describe the behaviors of [[solids]], [[gases]], and [[fluids]]. It is often referred to as "Newtonian mechanics" after [[Isaac Newton]] and his [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]]. It also includes the classical approach as given by [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] and [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange]] methods. It deals with the motion of particles and general system of particles.

There are many branches of classical mechanics, such as: [[statics]], [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], [[kinematics]], [[continuum mechanics]] (which includes [[fluid mechanics]]), [[statistical mechanics]], etc.
*Mechanics: A branch of physics in which we study about the object and properties of an object in form of motion under the action of force.

==Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics==
{{main|Thermodynamics|Statistical mechanics}}

The first chapter of ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'' is about the [[Atomic theory#Modern atomic theory|existence of atoms]], which Feynman considered to be the most compact statement of physics, from which science could easily result even if all other knowledge was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Richard Phillips |last1=Feynman|authorlink1=Richard Feynman|first2= Robert Benjamin |last2=Leighton|authorlink2=Robert B. Leighton|first3=Matthew Linzee |last3=Sands |authorlink3=Matthew Sands|year= 1963|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics| isbn= 978-0-201-02116-5 |page=1|title-link=The Feynman Lectures on Physics}}. Feynman begins with the [[atomic theory|atomic hypothesis]], as his most compact statement of all scientific knowledge: "If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations ..., what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is ... that ''all things are made up of atoms – little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. ...''" vol. '''I''' p. I–2&lt;/ref&gt; By modeling matter as collections of hard spheres, it is possible to describe the [[kinetic theory of gases]], upon which classical thermodynamics is based.

Thermodynamics studies the effects of changes in [[temperature]], [[pressure]], and [[volume]] on [[physical system]]s on the [[macroscopic]] scale, and the transfer of energy as [[heat]].&lt;ref name="Perot"&gt;{{cite book |author=Perot, Pierre |title=A to Z of Thermodynamics |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-19-856552-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, John O.E. |title=The Essential Dictionary of Science |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, thermodynamics developed out of the desire to increase the [[thermodynamic efficiency|efficiency]] of early [[steam engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clausius |first=Rudolf |title=On the Motive Power of Heat, and on the Laws which can be deduced from it for the Theory of Heat |work=Poggendorff's ''Annalee dere Physic'' | chapter=LXXIX | publisher=Dover Reprint |year=1850 |isbn=978-0-486-59065-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting point for most thermodynamic considerations is the [[laws of thermodynamics]], which postulate that [[energy]] can be exchanged between physical systems as heat or [[Mechanical work|work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Van Ness, H.C. |title=Understanding Thermodynamics |publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. |year=1969 |isbn=978-0-486-63277-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also postulate the existence of a quantity named [[entropy]], which can be defined for any system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dugdale, J. S. |title=Entropy and its Physical Meaning |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7484-0569-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In thermodynamics, interactions between large ensembles of objects are studied and categorized. Central to this are the concepts of [[System (thermodynamics)|system]] and [[Surroundings (thermodynamics)|surroundings]]. A system is composed of particles, whose average motions define its properties, which in turn are related to one another through [[Equation of state|equations of state]]. Properties can be combined to express [[internal energy]] and [[thermodynamic potential]]s, which are useful for determining conditions for [[Dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] and [[spontaneous process]]es.

==Relativity==
{{main|Special relativity|General relativity}}
The special theory of relativity enjoys a relationship with electromagnetism and mechanics; that is, the [[principle of relativity]] and the [[principle of stationary action]] in mechanics can be used to derive [[Maxwell's equations]],&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Lifshitz (1951, 1962), ''The Classical Theory of Fields'', Library of Congress Card Number 62-9181, Chapters 1–4 (3rd edition is {{ISBN|0-08-016019-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corson and Lorrain, ''Electromagnetic Fields and Waves'' {{ISBN|0-7167-1823-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''vice versa''.

The theory of special relativity was proposed in 1905 by [[Albert Einstein]] in his article "[[Annus Mirabilis papers#Special relativity|On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies]]". The title of the article refers to the fact that special relativity resolves an inconsistency between [[Maxwell's equations]] and classical mechanics. The theory is based on [[postulates of special relativity|two postulates]]: (1) that the mathematical forms of the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] are invariant in all [[inertial frame of reference|inertial systems]]; and (2) that the [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] is constant and independent of the source or observer. Reconciling the two postulates requires a unification of [[space]] and [[time in physics|time]] into the frame-dependent concept of [[spacetime]].

General relativity is the [[geometrical]] theory of [[gravitation]] published by Albert Einstein in 1915/16.&lt;ref name=Ein1915&gt;{{cite journal |last=Einstein |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Einstein |date=November 25, 1915 |title=Die Feldgleichungen der Gravitation |journal=Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin |pages=844–847 |url=http://nausikaa2.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/toc/toc.x.cgi?dir=6E3MAXK4&amp;step=thumb |accessdate=2006-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ein1916&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein |first=Albert |title=The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume= 354|issue= 7|pages= 769-822|year=1916 |url=http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |doi=10.1002/andp.19163540702 |format=PDF |id= |accessdate=2006-09-03 |bibcode=1916AnP...354..769E |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829045130/http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |archivedate=2006-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It unifies special relativity, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], and the insight that gravitation can be described by the [[curvature]] of space and time. In general relativity, the curvature of spacetime is produced by the [[energy]] of matter and radiation.

==Quantum mechanics==
{{main|Quantum mechanics}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|right|225px|The first few [[hydrogen atom]] [[Electron configuration|electron orbital]]s shown as cross-sections with color-coded [[probability amplitude|probability density]]]]
[[File:SchrodingerEquation.svg|thumb|right|225px|[[Schrödinger equation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]]]
[[Quantum mechanics]] is the branch of physics treating [[atom]]ic and [[subatomic particle|subatomic]] systems and their interaction with [[radiation]]. It is based on the observation that all forms of energy are released in discrete units or bundles called "[[quantum|quanta]]". Remarkably, quantum theory typically permits only [[probability|probable]] or [[statistics|statistical]] calculation of the observed features of subatomic particles, understood in terms of [[wave function]]s. The [[Schrödinger equation]] plays the role in quantum mechanics that [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws]] and [[conservation of energy]] serve in classical mechanics—i.e., it predicts the future behavior of a [[dynamical system|dynamic system]]—and is a [[wave equation]] that is used to solve for wavefunctions.

For example, the light, or electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by an atom has only certain [[frequencies]] (or [[wavelength]]s), as can be seen from the [[Emission spectrum|line spectrum]] associated with the chemical element represented by that atom. The quantum theory shows that those frequencies correspond to definite energies of the light quanta, or [[photon]]s, and result from the fact that the [[electron]]s of the atom can have only certain allowed energy values, or levels; when an electron changes from one allowed level to another, a quantum of energy is emitted or absorbed whose frequency is directly proportional to the energy difference between the two levels. The [[photoelectric effect]] further confirmed the quantization of light.

In 1924, [[Louis de Broglie]] proposed that not only do light waves sometimes exhibit particle-like properties, but particles may also exhibit wave-like properties. Two different formulations of quantum mechanics were presented following de Broglie's suggestion. The [[wave|wave mechanics]] of [[Erwin Schrödinger]] (1926) involves the use of a mathematical entity, the wave function, which is related to the probability of finding a particle at a given point in space. The [[matrix mechanics]] of [[Werner Heisenberg]] (1925) makes no mention of wave functions or similar concepts but was shown to be mathematically equivalent to Schrödinger's theory. A particularly important discovery of the quantum theory is the [[uncertainty principle]], enunciated by Heisenberg in 1927, which places an absolute theoretical limit on the accuracy of certain measurements; as a result, the assumption by earlier scientists that the physical state of a system could be measured exactly and used to predict future states had to be abandoned. Quantum mechanics was combined with the theory of relativity in the formulation of [[Paul Dirac]]. Other developments include [[quantum statistics]], [[quantum electrodynamics]], concerned with interactions between charged particles and electromagnetic fields; and its generalization, [[quantum field theory]].

Also known as theory of everything, this theory combines the theory of general relativity and quantum mechanics to make a single theory. This theory can predict about properties of both small and big objects. This theory is currently under developmental stage.

In [[Latin language|Latin]], it is called a ''membrum'' or ''membrum orationis''.

Sentences consisting of two cola are called ''dicola''; those with three are ''[[tricolon|tricola]]''. The corresponding adjectives are ''dicolic'' and ''tricolic''; ''colic'' is not used in this sense. In writing, these cola are often separated by [[colon (punctuation)|colons]].

An [[isocolon]] is a sentence composed of cola of equal syllabic length.

The [[Septuagint]] used this system in the poetic books such as the [[Psalms]]. 
When [[Jerome]] translated the books of the Prophets, he arranged the text colometrically.

The colometric system was used in bilingual codices of [[New Testament]], such as [[Codex Bezae]] and [[Codex Claromontanus]]. Some Greek and Latin manuscripts also used this system, including [[Codex Coislinianus]] and [[Codex Amiatinus]].

'''Coreshine''' is an astronomical term for [[infrared]] light scattered by unusually large grains of dust in the denser core regions of [[molecular clouds]] and which evidently begin their growth before the start of cloud collapse. These clouds which are opaque to visible light, are a mixture of gas and dust and are the regions where stars are formed.

Coreshine offers a new tool for observing the earliest phases of [[star formation]], a process effectively hidden up to now. The scattered mid-infrared light, found throughout our galaxy, could reveal the origins of the cloud material, the size and density of the dust particles, the age of the core region, the distribution of the dust and gas, and the chemical processes taking place deep inside the cloud.

The phenomenon was first studied seriously with [[NASA]]’s [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. Researchers Laurent Pagani ([[CNRS]], [[Paris Observatory]]), Jürgen Steinacker ([[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy]]) and colleagues from the [[California Institute of Technology]] and ''Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de l’Observatoire de Grenoble'', discovered surprisingly bright mid-infrared radiation from the core of the molecular cloud L183 in the constellation [[Serpens Cauda]] 360 light-years away. Using computer simulations, it became clear that they were observing light scattered by particles of around 1 micrometer in diameter. In a follow-up they studied 110 molecular clouds, at distances between 300 and 1300 light-years, and which had been part of previous Spitzer surveys. The results showed that coreshine is a widespread phenomenon and was present in about half the clouds studied. Clouds in the southern constellation [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] show no coreshine and it is thought that this has been brought about by recorded supernova explosions in the region, blowing away or destroying larger dust particles.

Coreshine will lead to new projects for both the Spitzer and [[James Webb Space Telescope]], due to be launched in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universetoday.com/ Universe Today]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aanda.org/index.php?option=com_article&amp;access=standard&amp;Itemid=129&amp;url=/articles/aa/full_html/2010/03/aa12835-09/aa12835-09.html Direct evidence of dust growth in L183 from mid-infrared light scattering - Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Defuzzification''' is the process of producing a quantifiable result in [[Crisp logic]], given fuzzy sets and corresponding membership degrees. It is the process that maps a fuzzy set to a crisp set. It is typically needed in [[fuzzy control]] systems. These will have a number of rules that transform a number of variables into a fuzzy result, that is, the result is described in terms of membership in [[fuzzy sets]]. For example, rules designed to decide how much pressure to apply might result in "Decrease Pressure (15%), Maintain Pressure (34%), Increase Pressure (72%)". Defuzzification is interpreting the membership degrees of the fuzzy sets into a specific decision or real value.
[[File:Fuzzy logic.png|thumb|Defuzzification]]

The simplest but least useful defuzzification method is to choose the set with the highest membership, in this case, "Increase Pressure" since it has a 72% membership, and ignore the others, and convert this 72% to some number. The problem with this approach is that it loses information. The rules that called for decreasing or maintaining pressure might as well have not been there in this case.

A common and useful defuzzification technique is ''center of gravity''. First, the results of the rules must be added together in some way. The most typical fuzzy set membership function has the graph of a [[triangle]]. Now, if this triangle were to be cut in a straight horizontal line somewhere between the top and the bottom, and the top portion were to be removed, the remaining portion forms a [[trapezoid]]. The first step of defuzzification typically "chops off" parts of the graphs to form trapezoids (or other shapes if the initial shapes were not triangles). For example, if the output has "Decrease Pressure (15%)", then this triangle will be cut 15% the way up from the bottom. In the most common technique, all of these trapezoids are then superimposed one upon another, forming a single [[geometric shape]]. Then, the [[centroid]] of this shape, called the ''fuzzy centroid'', is calculated. The ''x'' coordinate of the centroid is the defuzzified value.

==Methods==
There are many different methods of defuzzification available, including the following:&lt;ref name=Leekwijck&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=van Leekwijck, W. |author2=Kerre, E.

[[File:Root digging stick at Rocky Reach Dam Museum 2.jpg|alt=|thumb|A digging stick]]
In [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], a '''digging stick''', or sometimes '''yam stick''', is a wooden implement used primarily by [[List of subsistence techniques|subsistence-based]] cultures to dig out underground food such as roots and tubers or [[burrowing animals]] and anthills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/digging-stick The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved July 24, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The stick may also have other uses in hunting or general domestic tasks.

They are common to the [[Indigenous Australians]] but also other peoples worldwide. The tool normally consists of little more than a sturdy stick which has been shaped or sharpened and perhaps hardened by being placed temporarily in a fire. Fashioned with handles for pulling or pushing, it forms a prehistoric [[plow]], and is also a precursor of most modern agricultural handtools.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Retrieved March 26, 2015, from Britannica.com website: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/163245/digging-stick&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a simple [[tool|device]], and has to be tough and hardy in order not to break.

== By region ==

=== Mexico and the Mesoamerican region ===
In Mexico and the [[Mesoamerican region]], the digging stick was the most important agricultural tool throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/index.php?one=azt&amp;two=art&amp;tab=two&amp;typ=reg&amp;id=377 Study the Digging Stick] Mexicolore.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/index.php?one=azt&amp;two=art&amp;id=320&amp;typ=reg Uictli] Mexicolore.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''coa'' stick normally flares out into a triangle at the end and is used for cultivating maize. It is still used for agriculture in some indigenous communities, with some newer 20th-century versions having the addition of a little metal tip.

Other digging sticks, according to Native Americans of the Columbia Plateau, have been used since time immemorial to gather edible roots like balsamroot, bitterroot, camas, and varieties of biscuitroot. Typical digging sticks were and are still about 2 to 3 feet in length, usually slightly arched, with the bottom tip shaved off at an angle. A 5 to 8 inch cross-piece made of antler, bone, or wood was fitted perpendicularly over the top of the stick, allowing the use of two hands to drive the tool into the ground. Since contact with the Europeans in the 19th century, Native Americans have also adapted the use of a metal in making digging sticks.

=== Ethiopia and the Harar region ===

The most common digging stick found in [[Ethiopia]] is the ''ankassay'' in [[Amharic]], a [[Semitic language]] spoken in [[Ethiopia]] and the second-most spoken Semitic language in the world. The ''ankassay'' is a single shaft that is about 4–5 feet in length with a socket-hafted pointed iron blade as the tip.&lt;ref name="Simoons"&gt;Simoons, Frederick J. "The Forked Digging Stick of the Gurage", "[[Zeitschrift für Ethnologie]]", Berlin, Retrieved February 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other digging sticks are unique to the Harar region located in East-Central [[Ethiopia]], which are considered to be unusual due to their function beyond the basic use of other digging sticks, and the use of one as a plow.

The ''deungora'' is a particularly long digging stick is about 110 centimeters, or approximately 3.6 feet, in length with a socket-hafted pointed iron blade as the tip. What's unique about this digging stick is that a bored stone, about 15 centimeters in diameter, is attached at the opposing end. This stone shares the same form as other bored stones that have been discovered in archaeological sites in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="Simoons"/&gt;

''Maresha'' is the [[Gurage]] name, also the same word used by the [[Amhara people|Amhara]], for a digging stick that differs in construction because of its forked form. It is used primarily to dig holes for construction, planting, and harvesting roots and tubers. This tool is used as a plow to turn over the soil of an entire field before planting. It is used to break clods of soil in areas where the soil is hard or in areas that may be too steep for plowing, and to dig holes for construction or to transplant domestic plants. When compared to the ''ankassay'', this digging stick can perform the same duties and in addition can be used as a hoe.&lt;ref name="Simoons"/&gt;

=== East-Central New Guinea ===

The Kuman people of this region were horticulturists who used basic tools such as the digging stick, wooden hoe, and wooden spade in their daily lives. Eventually they started to use more sophisticated tools such as iron spades and pick-axes.&lt;ref name="Nilles"&gt;Nilles, John. "The Kuman people: A study of cultural change in a primitive society in the Central Highlands of New Guinea." Oceania (1953): 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main types of digging sticks both shared a similar shape but differed in size:

* A larger and heavier digging stick with a diameter of about 4 centimeters and 2 meters in length, used for the purpose of turning over the soil surface for new gardens
* A smaller and lighter digging stick with a diameter of about 2 centimeters and 1 meter (or less) in length, mainly used for basic horticulture tasks&lt;ref name="Nilles"/&gt;

{{Manufacturing}}
A '''distributed control system''' ('''DCS''') is a computerised [[control system]] for a process or plant usually with a large number of [[control loop]]s, in which autonomous controllers are distributed throughout the system, but there is central operator supervisory control.  This is in contrast to systems that use centralized controllers; either discrete controllers located at a central control room or within a central computer. The DCS concept increases reliability and reduces installation costs by localising control functions near the process plant, with remote monitoring and supervision.  

Distributed control systems first emerged in large, high value, safety critical process industries, and were attractive because the DCS manufacturer would supply both the local control level and central supervisory equipment as an integrated package, thus reducing design integration risk. Today the functionality of [[SCADA]] and DCS systems are very similar, but DCS tends to be used on large continuous process plants where high reliability and security is important, and the control room is not geographically remote. 

==Structure==
[[File:Functional levels of a Distributed Control System.svg|thumb|500px|Functional levels of a manufacturing control operation]]
The key attribute of a DCS is its reliability due to the distribution of the control processing around nodes in the system. This mitigates a single processor failure. If a processor fails, it will only affect one section of the plant process, as opposed to a failure of a central computer which would affect the whole process. This distribution of computing power local to the field Input/Output (I/O) connection racks also ensures fast controller processing times by removing possible network and central processing delays. 

The accompanying diagram is a general model which shows functional manufacturing levels using computerised control.  

Referring to the diagram;

* Level 0 contains the field devices such as flow and temperature sensors, and final control elements, such as [[control valve]]s
* Level 1 contains the industrialised Input/Output (I/O) modules, and their associated distributed electronic processors.   
* Level 2 contains the supervisory computers, which  collect information from processor nodes on the system, and provide the operator control screens. 
* Level 3 is the production control level, which does not directly control the process, but is concerned with monitoring production and monitoring targets
* Level 4 is the production scheduling level. 

Levels 1 and 2 are the functional levels of a traditional DCS, in which all equipment are part of an integrated system from a single manufacturer. 

Levels 3 and 4 are not strictly [[process control]] in the traditional sense, but where production control and scheduling takes place.

===Technical points===
[[File:Smart current loop positioner.png|thumb|Example of a continuous flow control loop. Signalling is by industry standard 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA current loops, and a "smart" [[control valve|valve positioner]] ensures the [[control valve]] operates correctly.]]
The processor nodes and operator [[graphical user interface|graphical displays]] are connected over proprietary or industry standard networks, and network reliability is increased by dual redundancy cabling over diverse routes. This distributed topology also reduces the amount of field cabling by siting the I/O modules and their associated processors close to the process plant. 

The processors receive information from input modules, process the information and decide control actions to be signalled by the output modules. The field inputs and outputs can be [[analog signal|analog signals]] e.g. [[current loop|4–20&amp;nbsp;mA DC current loop]] or 2 state signals that switch either "on" or "off", such as relay contacts or a semiconductor switch.  

DCSs are connected to sensors and actuators and use [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint control]] to control the flow of material through the plant.  A typical application is a [[PID controller]] fed by a flow meter and using a [[control valve]] as the final control element. The DCS sends the setpoint required by the process to the controller which instructs a valve to operate so that the process reaches and stays at the  desired setpoint. (see 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA schematic for example).

Large oil refineries and chemical plants have several thousand I/O points and employ very large DCS.  Processes are not limited to fluidic flow through pipes, however, and can also include things like [[paper machine]]s and their associated quality controls, [[Adjustable-speed drive|variable speed drives]] and [[Motor controller|motor control centers]], [[cement kiln]]s, [[Mining|mining operations]], [[Extractive metallurgy|ore processing]] facilities, and [[Et cetera|many others]]. 

DCSs in very high reliability applications can have dual redundant processors with "hot" switch over on fault, to enhance the reliability of the control system. 

Although 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA  has been the main field signalling standard, modern DCS systems can also support [[fieldbus]] digital protocols, such as Foundation Fieldbus, profibus, HART, Modbus, PC Link etc., and other digital communication protocols such as [[modbus]].

Modern DCSs also support [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and [[fuzzy logic]] applications. Recent research focuses on the synthesis of optimal distributed controllers, which optimizes a certain [[H-infinity methods in control theory|H-infinity]] or the H 2 control criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Distributed Control Design for Spatially Interconnected Systems|last = D'Andrea|first = Raffaello |date = 9 September 2003|journal = IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control|doi = 10.1109/tac.2003.816954 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Distributed Control for Identical Dynamically Coupled Systems: A Decomposition Approach|last = Massiaoni|first = Paolo|date = 1 January 2009|journal = IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control|doi = 10.1109/tac.2008.2009574 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical applications==

* [[Chemical plant]]s

==History==
[[File:Kontrollrom Tyssedal.jpg|thumb|A pre-DCS era central control room. Whilst the controls are centralised in one place, they are still discrete and not integrated into one system.]] 
[[File:Leitstand 2.jpg|thumb|A DCS control room where plant information and controls are displayed on computer graphics screens. The operators are seated as they can view and control any part of the process from their screens, whilst retaining a plant overview.]]

===Evolution of process control operations===
Process control of large industrial plants has evolved through many stages. Initially, control would be from panels local to the process plant. However this required a large manpower resource to attend to these dispersed panels, and there was no overall view of the process. The next logical development was the transmission of all plant measurements to a permanently-manned central control room. Effectively this was the centralisation of all the localised panels, with the advantages of lower manning levels and easier overview of the process. Often the controllers were behind the control room panels, and all automatic and manual control outputs were transmitted back to plant. However, whilst providing a central control focus, this arrangement was inflexible as each control loop had its own controller hardware, and continual operator movement within the control room was required to view different parts of the process. 

With the coming of electronic processors and graphic displays it became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computer-based algorithms, hosted on a network of input/output racks with their own control processors. These could be distributed around plant, and communicate with the graphic display in the control room or rooms. The distributed control system was born. 

The introduction of DCSs allowed easy interconnection and re-configuration of plant controls such as cascaded loops and interlocks, and easy interfacing with other production computer systems. It enabled sophisticated alarm handling, introduced automatic event logging, removed the need for physical records such as chart recorders, allowed the control racks to be networked and thereby located locally to plant to reduce cabling runs, and provided high level overviews of plant status and production levels.

===Origins===
Early [[minicomputer]]s were used in the control of industrial processes since the beginning of the 1960s.  The [[IBM 1800 Data Acquisition and Control System|IBM 1800]], for example, was an early computer that had input/output hardware to gather process signals in a plant for conversion from field contact levels (for digital points) and analog signals to the digital domain.

The first industrial control computer system was built 1959 at the Texaco Port Arthur, Texas, refinery with an [[TRW Inc.#Semiconductors and computers|RW-300]] of the [[TRW Inc.|Ramo-Wooldridge]] Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1975, both [[Honeywell]] and Japanese electrical engineering firm [[Yokogawa]] introduced their own independently produced DCS's - TDC 2000 and CENTUM systems, respectively. US-based Bristol also introduced their UCS 3000 universal controller in 1975. In 1978 [[Valmet]] introduced their own DCS system called Damatic (latest generation named Valmet DNA&lt;ref name="Valmet"&gt;[http://www.valmet.com/products/automation/valmet-dna-dcs/] Valmet DNA&lt;/ref&gt;). In 1980, Bailey (now part of ABB&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abb.com/controlsystems] INFI 90&lt;/ref&gt;) introduced the NETWORK 90 system,  Fisher Controls (now part of [[Emerson Electric]]) introduced the PROVoX system, [[Fischer &amp; Porter Company]] (now also part of ABB&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abb.com/product/us/9AAC115762.aspx] DCI-4000&lt;/ref&gt;) introduced DCI-4000 (DCI stands for Distributed Control Instrumentation).

The DCS largely came about due to the increased availability of microcomputers and the proliferation of microprocessors in the world of process control.  Computers had already been applied to process automation for some time in the form of both [[direct digital control]] (DDC) and setpoint control. In the early 1970s [[Taylor Instrument Company]], (now part of ABB) developed the 1010 system, Foxboro the FOX1 system, Fisher Controls the DC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; system and [[Bailey Controls]] the 1055 systems.  All of these were DDC applications implemented within minicomputers ([[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-11]], [[Varian Data Machines]], [[MODCOMP]] etc.) and connected to proprietary Input/Output hardware. Sophisticated (for the time) continuous as well as batch control was implemented in this way. A more conservative approach was setpoint control, where process computers supervised clusters of analog process controllers. A workstation provided visibility into the process using text and crude character graphics. Availability of a fully functional graphical user interface was a way away.

===Development===
Central to the DCS model was the inclusion of control function blocks. Function blocks evolved from early, more primitive DDC concepts of "Table Driven" software. One of the first embodiments of object-oriented software, function blocks were self-contained "blocks" of code that emulated analog hardware control components and performed tasks that were essential to process control, such as execution of PID algorithms.  Function blocks continue to endure as the predominant method of control for DCS suppliers, and are supported by key technologies such as Foundation Fieldbus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fieldbus.org] Foundation Fieldbus&lt;/ref&gt; today.

[[Midac]] Systems, of Sydney, Australia, developed an objected-oriented distributed direct digital control system in 1982. The central system ran 11 microprocessors sharing tasks and common memory and connected to a serial communication network of distributed controllers each running two Z80s. The system was installed at the University of Melbourne.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Digital communication between distributed controllers, workstations and other computing elements (peer to peer access) was one of the primary advantages of the DCS.  Attention was duly focused on the networks, which provided the all-important lines of communication that, for process applications, had to incorporate specific functions such as determinism and redundancy. As a result, many suppliers embraced the IEEE 802.4 networking standard. This decision set the stage for the wave of migrations necessary when information technology moved into process automation and IEEE 802.3 rather than IEEE 802.4 prevailed as the control LAN.

===The network-centric era of the 1980s===
In the 1980s, users began to look at DCSs as more than just basic process control. A very early example of a [[Direct Digital Control]] DCS was completed by the Australian business [[Midac]] in 1981–82 using R-Tec Australian designed hardware. The system installed at the [[University of Melbourne]] used a serial communications network, connecting campus buildings back to a control room "front end". Each remote unit ran two [[Z80]] microprocessors, while the front end ran eleven Z80s in a parallel processing configuration with paged common memory to share tasks and that could run up to 20,000 concurrent control objects.

It was believed that if openness could be achieved and greater amounts of data could be shared throughout the enterprise that even greater things could be achieved. The first attempts to increase the openness of DCSs resulted in the adoption of the predominant operating system of the day: ''UNIX''.  UNIX and its companion networking technology TCP-IP were developed by the US Department of Defense for openness, which was precisely the issue the process industries were looking to resolve.

As a result, suppliers also began to adopt Ethernet-based networks with their own proprietary protocol layers.  The full TCP/IP standard was not implemented, but the use of Ethernet made it possible to implement the first instances of object management and global data access technology.  The 1980s also witnessed the first [[programmable logic controller|PLCs]] integrated into the DCS infrastructure.  Plant-wide historians also emerged to capitalize on the extended reach of automation systems.  The first DCS supplier to adopt UNIX and Ethernet networking technologies was Foxboro, who introduced the I/A Series&lt;ref&gt;[http://iom.invensys.com/UK/Pages/Foxboro_DCSIASeries.aspx] Foxboro I/A Series Distributed Control System&lt;/ref&gt; system in 1987.

===The application-centric era of the 1990s===
The drive toward openness in the 1980s gained momentum through the 1990s with the increased adoption of [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) components and IT standards.  Probably the biggest transition undertaken during this time was the move from the UNIX operating system to the Windows environment.  While the realm of the real time operating system ([[RTOS]]) for control applications remains dominated by real time commercial variants of UNIX or proprietary operating systems, everything above real-time control has made the transition to Windows.

The introduction of Microsoft at the desktop and server layers resulted in the development of technologies such as [[OLE for process control|OLE for process control (OPC)]], which is now a de facto industry connectivity standard.  Internet technology also began to make its mark in automation and the  world, with most DCS HMI supporting Internet connectivity.  The 1990s were also known for the "Fieldbus Wars", where rival organizations competed to define what would become the IEC [[fieldbus]] standard for digital communication with field instrumentation instead of 4–20 milliamp analog communications.  The first fieldbus installations occurred in the 1990s.  Towards the end of the decade, the technology began to develop significant momentum, with the market consolidated around Ethernet I/P, Foundation Fieldbus and Profibus PA for process automation applications.  Some suppliers built new systems from the ground up to maximize functionality with fieldbus, such as [[Rockwell Automation|Rockwell]] PlantPAx System, [[Honeywell]] with [[Experion]] &amp; Plantscape [[SCADA]] systems, [[ABB Group|ABB]] with System 800xA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abb.com/product/us/9AAC115756.aspx|title=ABB System 800xA - process, electrical, safety, telecoms in one system|website=www.abb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson Process Management&lt;ref&gt;[http://easydeltav.com] [[Emerson Process Management]]&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Emerson Process Management]] [[DeltaV]] control system, [[Siemens]] with the SPPA-T3000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.siemens.com/hq/en/automation/power-generation/sppa-t3000.htm] SPPA-T3000&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Simatic PCS 7]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pcs.khe.siemens.com/index.aspx?nr%3D1075 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329065215/http://pcs.khe.siemens.com/index.aspx?nr=1075 |archivedate=2007-03-29 |df= }} Simatic PCS 7&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes Marshall&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbesmarshall.com/fm_micro/DCS/Products1.aspx?flag=1&amp;id=dcs&amp;pid=551&amp;prodName=Microcon+%20Distributed%20Control%20System(DCS)] [[Forbes Marshall]]&lt;/ref&gt; with the Microcon+ control system and [[Azbil Corporation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azbil.com] Azbil Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Harmonas-DEO]] system. Fieldbus technics have been used to integrate machine, drives, quality and [[condition monitoring]] applications to one DCS with Valmet DNA system.&lt;ref name="Valmet" /&gt;

The impact of COTS, however, was most pronounced at the hardware layer.  For years, the primary business of DCS suppliers had been the supply of large amounts of hardware, particularly I/O and controllers.  The initial proliferation of DCSs required the installation of prodigious amounts of this hardware, most of it manufactured from the bottom up by DCS suppliers.  Standard computer components from manufacturers such as Intel and Motorola, however, made it cost prohibitive for DCS suppliers to continue making their own components, workstations, and networking hardware.

As the suppliers made the transition to COTS components, they also discovered that the hardware market was shrinking fast.  COTS not only resulted in lower manufacturing costs for the supplier, but also steadily decreasing prices for the end users, who were also becoming increasingly vocal over what they perceived to be unduly high hardware costs. Some suppliers that were previously stronger in the [[programmable logic controller|PLC]] business, such as Rockwell Automation and Siemens, were able to leverage their expertise in manufacturing control hardware to enter the DCS marketplace with cost effective offerings, while the stability/scalability/reliability and functionality of these emerging systems are still improving. The traditional DCS suppliers introduced new generation DCS System based on the latest Communication and IEC Standards, which resulting in a trend of combining the traditional concepts/functionalities for PLC and DCS into a one for all solution—named "[[Process Automation System]]" (PAS). The gaps among the various systems remain at the areas such as: the database integrity, pre-engineering functionality, system maturity, communication transparency and reliability. While it is expected the cost ratio is relatively the same (the more powerful the systems are, the more expensive they will be), the reality of the automation business is often operating strategically case by case. The current next evolution step is called [[Collaborative Process Automation Systems]].

To compound the issue, suppliers were also realizing that the hardware market was becoming saturated.  The life cycle of hardware components such as I/O and wiring is also typically in the range of 15 to over 20 years, making for a challenging replacement market.  Many of the older systems that were installed in the 1970s and 1980s are still in use today, and there is a considerable installed base of systems in the market that are approaching the end of their useful life.  Developed industrial economies in North America, Europe, and Japan already had many thousands of DCSs installed, and with few if any new plants being built, the market for new hardware was shifting rapidly to smaller, albeit faster growing regions such as China, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.

Because of the shrinking hardware business, suppliers began to make the challenging transition from a hardware-based business model to one based on software and value-added services.  It is a transition that is still being made today.  The applications portfolio offered by suppliers expanded considerably in the '90s to include areas such as production management, model-based control, real-time optimization, plant asset management (PAM), Real-time performance management (RPM) tools, [[alarm management]], and many others.  To obtain the true value from these applications, however, often requires a considerable service content, which the suppliers also provide.

===Modern systems (2010 onwards)===
The latest developments in DCS include the following new technologies:

# [[Wireless]] systems and protocols
# [[Remote data transmission|Remote transmission]], logging and data historian
#  Mobile interfaces and controls
# [[Embedded HTTP server|Embedded web-servers]]

Increasingly, and ironically, DCS are becoming centralised at plant level, with the ability to log into the remote equipment. This enables operator to control both at enterprise level ( macro ) and at the equipment level (micro) both within and outside the plant as physical location due to interconnectivity primarily due to wireless and remote access has shrunk.

As wireless protocols are developed and refined, DCS increasingly includes wireless communication. DCS controllers are now often equipped with embedded servers and provide on-the-go web access. Whether DCS will lead IIOT or borrow key elements from remains to be established.

Many vendors provide the option of a mobile HMI, ready for both [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]]. With these interfaces, the threat of security breaches and possible damage to plant and process are now very real.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8764">'''Doctorandus''' ({{IPA-nl|dɔktoːˈrɑndɵs}}; {{Lang-la|he who should become a [[Doctorate|doctor]]}}), abbreviated '''drs.''', is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[List of academic ranks|academic title]] according to the pre-[[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]]–[[Master's degree|Master]] system. The female form is 'doctoranda' (abbreviated '''dra.''', though this abbreviation is no longer used). The title is acquired by passing the ''doctoraalexamen'', the [[Final examination|exam]] which usually concludes university study. Some students will continue to do research under the supervision of a [[professor]], which eventually allows them to obtain the title of [[Doctorate|doctor]].

In Dutch, the words ''doctoraal'' and ''doctoraat'' have different meanings, the first referring to the doctorandus, the second word referring to the doctorate phase or title. The word 'doctorandus' is based on the traditional principle that this degree is a prerequisite and intermediate step for obtaining a doctorate title. However, in the twentieth century the doctorandi have become considered to be graduates and when they can choose a scientific career, the do usually as a paid ''[[promovendus]]'' and not as research students. An exception are medical students, where the doctoral exam is an intermediate step after which the students have to follow internships, in order to obtain the full medical degree of physician (''arts'' in Dutch).

== Netherlands ==
According to Dutch legislation, the Dutch doctorandus degree is equivalent to the [[Master of Arts|MA]] or [[MSc]] degree in English-speaking countries, with the difference that the coursework and comprehensive exams for a doctorate are included in the academic study. After being graduated to "drs.", the candidate can start with PhD-level research and writing the dissertation without any further exams.

The abbreviation is '''drs.''' This means that Dutch graduates who received the doctorandus title may sign like '''drs. A. Jansen'''. After the [[Bologna process]], the title doctorandus has been replaced by the degrees MA and MSc, and those who receive such Dutch degrees may choose: they may use MA/MSc behind their name, or continue to use drs., mr. or ir., reflecting the field in which they graduated. According to Art. 7.20 of the Dutch law on higher education and scientific research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005682/Hoofdstuk7597869/Titel1/Paragraaf4/Artikel720/geldigheidsdatum_25-08-2011 Art. 7.20 WHW]&lt;/ref&gt; a graduate of a master's degree granted through scientific education (i.e. by a Dutch research university) may sign as ir. (ir. stems from the dutch 'ingenieur' (engineer)) for those who graduated in an academic study of agriculture, natural environment or technical field, mr. (mr. stems from the dutch 'meester' (master) at law) for those who graduated in law and drs. by those who graduated in other fields. According to Art. 7.19a&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005682/Hoofdstuk7597869/Titel1/Paragraaf4/Artikel719a/geldigheidsdatum_25-08-2011 Art. 7.19a WHW]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Dutch customs the degrees granted to such graduates are MSc for engineers, MA or MSc for doctoranduses and established by ministerial regulation for jurists (actually LLM). This means that two situations can be discerned:

# Those who received their doctorandus title before the Bologna process have the option of signing like '''A. Jansen, M''', since the old doctorandus title (from before the Bologna process) is similar to a [[Master's degree]], and the shortcut M may officially be used in order to render such title as an international title.&lt;ref name=nvao&gt;[http://www.nvao.net/titulatuur_nl Titulatuur Nederland] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930061733/http://www.nvao.net/titulatuur_nl |date=September 30, 2011 }} Dutch-Flemish Accreditation Organization &amp;mdash; this source denies that one may bear a [[Bologna Process|Bologna-style]] bachelor's or master's degree instead of the old titles.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minocw.nl/bachelor/355/Titels.html Opleidingen en titels] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210184259/http://www.minocw.nl/bachelor/355/Titels.html |date=February 10, 2009 }} Dutch Department of Education, Culture and Science. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/hoger-onderwijs/titulatuur Titulatuur] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304133509/http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/hoger-onderwijs/titulatuur |date=March 4, 2012 }} website of the government of the Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=royal2002&gt;[http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/hoger-onderwijs/vraag-en-antwoord/welke-titel-mag-ik-voeren-als-ik-ben-afgestudeerd-of-gepromoveerd.html Vraag en antwoord.

# Those who received their master's degree from Dutch research universities after the Bologna process in other fields than agriculture, natural environment, technical field and law may also bear the title doctorandus and alternatively have the option of signing like '''A. Jansen, MA''' or '''A. Jansen, MSc''',&lt;ref&gt;Art. 7.19a, section 2, subsections f and g of the Dutch Law on higher education and scientific research.&lt;/ref&gt; but only as specified on their diploma. In this case, either a MA or a MSc is granted, which entitles one to bear the title doctorandus. This means that people who have graduated soon after 1 September 2002 have no (separate) bachelor's degree, but only a master's degree, which is their first degree.

== Belgium ==
In [[Belgium]] the title drs is only used for graduates working on a [[PhD]], which will then eventually change their title from Drs. to Dr. The title Lic (which stems from 'licentiaat') is used for those who have finished a masters' degree, but it is rarely used.

== Indonesia ==
The degree was also used in [[Indonesia]] until 1994 (because of Indonesia being a former colony of the Netherlands), where it was given to all bachelors except law, agriculture, natural environment, and engineering. The title ir. for academic engineers is still used in Indonesia by those who obtained their degree before 1994.

== Other ==
In Sweden and Estonia the term is used in the form: "doktorand", with the same etymology:  ''he who should become a [[Doctorate|doctor]]'' (but dropping the gender qualifier) to refer to a student reading for his or her doctorate. However, it is not a formal title and is never written abbreviated. Similarly, in Romania it is "doctorand", abbreviated "drd."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16775">'''Earth systems engineering and management''' (ESEM) is a discipline used to analyze, design, engineer and manage complex [[Natural environment|environmental]] [[system]]s. It entails a wide range of subject areas including [[anthropology]], [[engineering]], [[environmental science]], [[ethics]] and [[philosophy]]. At its core, ESEM looks to "rationally design and manage coupled human-natural systems in a highly integrated and ethical fashion" &lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"&gt;Gorman, Michael. (2004). ''Syllabus Spring Semester 2004''. Retrieved October 29, 2005 from http://repo-nt.tcc.virginia.edu/classes/ESEM/syllabus.html.&lt;/ref&gt; ESEM is a newly emerging area of study that has taken root at the University of Virginia, Cornell and other universities throughout the United States. Founders of Earth Systems Engineering &amp; Management are [[Braden Allenby]] and Michael Gorman.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Michael Gorman is currently a professor at the University of Virginia. He is with the School of Engineering and Applied Science in the department of Science, Technology and Society.  He teaches STS 300, Earth Systems Engineering &amp; Management, STS 401, Western Technology and Culture and STS 402, The Engineer in Society. Dr. Gorman's research interests include experimental simulations of scientific reasoning, described in his book Simulating Science (Indiana UP, 1992) and case studies of ethics, invention and discovery, which are described in his book Transforming Nature (Kluwer, 1998). He is the faculty advisor for a graduate program,  Societal and Ethical Dimensions of Systems Engineering.

In the UK, the [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceser Centre for Earth Systems Engineering Research] (CESER) at Newcastle University has a large ESEM programme, led by [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceg/staff/profile/richard.dawson Professor Richard Dawson].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceg/staff/profile/richard.dawson Richard Dawson] is Professor of Earth Systems Engineering at Newcastle University and Director of the Centre for Earth Systems Engineering Research.  His work has focused on developing adaptation solutions to ensure of structure and cities are resilient and sustainable in the face of intensifying global change.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction to ESEM==
For centuries now, mankind has been utilizing the earth and its natural resources to advance civilization and develop technology.  "As a principle {{sic}} result of Industrial Revolutions and associated changes in human demographics, technology systems, cultures, and economic systems have been the evolution of an Earth in which the dynamics of major natural systems are increasingly dominated by human activity".&lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"/&gt;

In many ways, ESEM views the earth as a human artifact. "In order to maintain continued stability of both natural and human systems, we need to develop the ability to rationally design and manage coupled human-natural systems in a highly integrated and ethical fashion- an Earth Systems Engineering and Management (ESEM) capability".&lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"/&gt; 

Over the past five years, the concept of Earth Systems Engineering and Management has been developed by a few individuals. One of particular note is [[Braden Allenby]].  Allenby holds that the foundation upon which ESEM is built is the notion that “the Earth, as it now exists, is a product of human design”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"&gt;* Allenby, B. R. (2005). Reconstructing earth : Technology and environment in the age of humans. Washington, DC: Island Press. From https://www.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip059/2005006241.html&lt;/ref&gt; In fact there are no longer any natural systems left in the world, “there are no places left on Earth that don’t fall under humanity’s shadow”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2000"&gt;Allenby, B. R. (2000, Winter). Earth systems engineering and management. IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 0278-0079(Winter) 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; “So the question is not, as some might wish, whether we should begin ESEM, because we have been doing it for a long time, albeit unintentionally.

The issue is whether we will assume the ethical responsibility to do ESEM rationally and responsibly”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; Unlike the traditional engineering and management process “which assume a high degree of knowledge and certainty about the systems behavior and a defined endpoint to the process,” ESEM “will be in constant dialog with [the systems], as they – and we and our cultures – change and coevolve together into the future”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; ESEM is a new concept, however there are a number of fields “such as [[industrial ecology]], [[adaptive management]], and [[systems engineering]] that can be relied on to enable rapid progress in developing” ESEM as a discipline.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt;

The premise of ESEM is that science and technology can provide successful and lasting solutions to human-created problems such as environmental pollution and climate-change.  This assumption has recently been challenged in ''Techno-Fix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ESEM, as all technological control and manipulation, causes unintended and inherently unavoidable negative consequences. Furthermore, due to the limitations of reductionist science, it is inherently impossible to predict all negative impacts of ESEM. Consequently, ESEM can be considered a high-risk technological fix, which attempts to address symptoms of the planetary environmental crisis rather than root causes, which are dysfunctional human behavior such as [[human overpopulation]] and [[overconsumption]].

==ESEM: Topics==
=== Adaptive management ===
[[Adaptive management]] is a key aspect of ESEM.  Adaptive management is a way of approaching environmental management.  It assumes that there is a great deal of uncertainty in environmental systems and holds that there is never a final solution to an earth systems problem.  Therefore, once action has been taken, the Earth Systems Engineer will need to be in constant dialogue with the system, watching for changes and how the system evolves. This way of monitoring and managing ecosystems accepts nature's inherent uncertainty and embraces it by never concluding to one certain cure to a problem.

===Earth Systems Engineering===
Earth [[Systems engineering]] is essentially the use of systems analysis methods in the examination of environmental problems.  When analyzing complex environmental systems, there are numerous data sets, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and variables.  It is therefore appropriate to approach such problems with a systems analysis method.  Essentially there are “six major phases of a properly-conducted system study”.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"&gt;* Gibson, J. E. (1991). How to do A systems analysis and systems analyst decalog. In W. T. Scherer (Ed.), (Fall 2003 ed.) (pp. 29-238). Department of Systems and Information Engineering: U of Virginia. Retrieved October 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The six phases are as follows:
#Determine Goals of System
#Establish Criteria for Ranking Alternative Candidates
#Develop Alternatives Solutions
#Rank Alternative Candidates
#Iterate
#Action

Part of the systems analysis process includes determining the goals of the system.  The key components of goal development include the development of a Descriptive Scenario, a Normative Scenario and Transitive Scenario.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt; Essentially, the Descriptive Scenario “describe[s] the situation as it is [and] tell[s] how it got to be that way” (Gibson, 1991).  Another important part of the Descriptive Scenario is how it “point[s] out the good features and the unacceptable elements of the status quo”.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt; Next, the Normative Scenario shows the final outcome or the way the system should operate under ideal conditions once action has been taken.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt;  For the Earth Systems approach, the “Normative Scenario” will involve the most complicated analysis.  The Normative Scenario will deal with stakeholders, creating a common trading zone or location for the free exchange of ideas to come up with a solution of where a system may be restored to or just how exactly a system should be modified.  Finally the Transitive scenario comes up with the actual process of changing a system from a Descriptive state to a Normative state.  Often, there is not one final solution, as noted in [[adaptive management]].  Typically an iterative process ensues as variables and inputs change and the system coevolves with the analysis.

===Environmental science===
{{main|Environmental science}}
When examining complex ecologic systems there is an inherent need for the Earth Systems Engineer to have a strong understanding of how natural processes function.  A training in Environmental Science will be crucial to fully understand the possible unintended and undesired effects of a proposed earth systems design.  Such fundamental topics such as the carbon cycle or the [[water cycle]] are pivotal processes that need to be understood.

===Ethics &amp; Sustainability===
At the heart of ESEM is the social, ethical and moral responsibility of the Earth Systems Engineer to stakeholders and to the natural system being engineered, to come up with an objective Transitive and Normative scenario.  “ESEM is the cultural and ethical context itself”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; The Earth Systems Engineer will be expected to explore the ethical implications of proposed solutions.

“The perspective of environmental sustainability requires that we ask ourselves how each interaction with the natural environment will affect, and be judged by, our children in the future” ”.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"&gt;Newton, L. H. (2003). Ethics and sustainability : Sustainable development and the moral life. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; “There is an increasing awareness that the process of development, left to itself, can cause irreversible damage to the environment, and that the resultant net addition to wealth and human welfare may very well be negative, if not catastrophic”.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"/&gt;  With this notion in mind, there is now a new goal of sustainable environment-friendly development.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"/&gt; [[Sustainable development]] is an important part to developing appropriate ESEM solutions to complex environmental problems.

===Industrial ecology===
{{main|Industrial ecology}}
Industrial ecology is the notion that major manufacturing and industrial processes need to shift from open loop systems to closed loop systems. This is essentially the recycling of waste to make new products.  This reduces refuse and increases the effectiveness of resources.  ESEM looks to minimize the impact of industrial processes on the environment, therefore the notion of recycling of industrial products is important to ESEM.

==Case Study: Florida Everglades==
The [[Florida Everglades]] system is a prime example of a complex ecological system that underwent an ESEM analysis.

;Background
The Florida Everglades is located in southern Florida.  The ecosystem is essentially a subtropical fresh water marsh composed of a variety of flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="Everglades, 2004"&gt;“Everglades.” Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. 10 April 2004. {{cite web |url=http://www.evergladesplan.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214102114/http://www.evergladesplan.org/ |archivedate=2005-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note is the [[saw grass]] and ridge slough formations that make the Everglades unique.&lt;ref name="Davis, 1997"&gt;(Davis, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of the past century mankind has had a rising presence in this region.  Currently, all of the eastern shore of Florida is developed and the population has increased to over 6 million residents.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt; This increased presence over the years has resulted in the channeling and redirecting of water from its traditional path through the Everglades and into the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean.  With this there have been a variety of deleterious effects upon the Florida Everglades.

;Descriptive Scenario
By 1993, the Everglades had been affected by numerous human developments.  The water flow and quality had been affected by the construction of canals and levees, to the series of elevated highways running through the Everglades to the expansive Everglades Agricultural Area that had contaminated the Everglades with high amounts of nitrogen.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  The result of this reduced flow of water was dramatic. There was a 90 - 95% reduction in wading bird populations, declining fish populations and salt water intrusion into the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Davis, 1997"/&gt; If the Florida Everglades were to remain a US landmark, action needed to be taken.

;Normative Scenario
It was in 1993 that the Army Corps of Engineers analyzed the system.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  They determined that an ideal situation would be to "get the water right".&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt; In doing so there would be a better flow through the Everglades and a reduced number of canals and levees sending water to tide.

;Transitive Scenario
It was from the development of the Normative Scenario, that the Army Corps of Engineers developed CERP, the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  In the plan they created a time line of projects to be completed, the estimated cost and the ultimate results of improving the ecosystem by having native flora and fauna prosper.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  They also outline the human benefits of the project.  Not only will the solution be sustainable, as future generations will be able to enjoy the Everglades, but the correction of the water flow and through the creation of storage facilities will reduce the occurrence of droughts and water shortages in southern Florida.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;

'''Environmental mitigation''', '''compensatory mitigation''', or [[mitigation banking]], are terms used primarily by the [[United States government]] and the related environmental industry to describe projects or programs intended to offset known impacts to an existing historic or [[natural resource]] such as a stream, wetland, endangered species, archeological site, paleontological site or historic structure.  To "mitigate" means to make less harsh or hostile.  Environmental mitigation is typically a part of an environmental crediting system established by governing bodies which involves allocating debits and credits. Debits occur in situations where a natural resource has been destroyed or severely impaired and credits are given in situations where a natural resource has been deemed to be improved or preserved. Therefore, when an entity such as a business or individual has a "debit" they are required to purchase a "credit". In some cases credits are bought from "mitigation banks" which are large mitigation projects established to provide credit to multiple parties in advance of development when such compensation cannot be achieved at the development site or is not seen as beneficial to the environment.  Crediting systems can allow credit to be generated in different ways.  For example, in the United States, projects are valued based on what the intentions of the project are which may be to preserve, enhance, restore or create (PERC) a natural resource.

== Advantages ==

Environmental mitigation and crediting systems are often praised for the following reasons:

=== Development-friendly ===
Mitigation is a more development-friendly alternative to strict [[environmental law]]s because it allows development to occur where environmental laws might prohibit it.

=== Mitigation industry ===
Mitigation inevitably creates a "mitigation industry". By requiring those who impact natural resources to purchase credits, a demand for mitigation credit is formed. Businesses related to environmental work typically benefit from such a system.

=== Targeting ecological value ===
Mitigation has the potential to save and restore the most valuable environmental resources at the least cost, assuming that regulation 1) protects health and welfare as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and 2) assures that a credit accurately represents measurable ecological value. Buyers are typically looking for mitigation credits that are both cheap and the most likely to meet regulatory requirements for compensatory mitigation.  Regulators must therefore find a balance between protecting the long term public interest and ensuring that buyers have the proper incentives to participate in the environmental marketplace.

=== Cost burden ===
Mitigation systems place the environmental costs of development mostly on the individuals or entities that are impacting the environment. Without environmental mitigation, costs of alleviating environmental damage caused by development could be placed in the hands of the government which would in turn pass costs on to taxpayers not responsible for environmental impacts.

=== Benefit to landowners ===
Land previously unused or impractical for development is given greater monetary value under a mitigation system. For instance, land in floodplains may be impractical for commercial or residential development but conducive for mitigation activities. Land in rural areas with very little potential for growth are more valuable when given the opportunity to be used for mitigation credits.

== Disadvantages ==

The following are criticisms of environmental mitigation and crediting systems:

=== Incorrect allocation and valuation of credits and debits ===
Mitigation regulations may not properly take into account the total ecological losses and gains associated with environmental impacts or mitigation when allocating debits and credits. Governing bodies are primarily responsible for prescribing the ecological criteria required to attain credits for mitigation. They are also responsible for valuation of credit. Therefore, it is evident that problems with the allocation and valuation of credits and debits might stem from the complexity of assessing the current comparative value of ecological resources (aka [[ecosystem services]]), ecosystem change over time, and/or a lack of understanding about what is beneficial or harmful to the environment overall.  To address these uncertainties regulators often assign 'coverage ratios' to compensatory mitigation agreements.  Coverage ratios of, for example, 3:1 require 3 compensatory mitigation credits for every 1 unit of [[ecological disturbance]].

=== Effects on land cost and availability ===
Mitigation could be seen as contributing to the increasing cost of land because some mitigation work requires that large amounts of land be purchased or put into conservation easements. Mitigation can therefore compete with other rural land uses such as agriculture and residential development.  This suggests that land owners must be alert to find the highest and best use for their properties given the potential market value that mitigation credits represent.

=== 'In perpetuity' commitments of land ===
Commitment of lands to compensatory mitigation must be done 'in perpetuity', meaning permanently into the future.  Otherwise, the long-term public interest could not be served via compensatory mitigation programs.  This means that properties must continue to be managed with ecosystem values in mind, sometimes preventing landowners from transforming the landscape to meet changing needs.  For example, future large scale development projects would not likely be permitted on previously dedicated mitigation properties.

The '''epithelial–mesenchymal transition''' ('''EMT''') is a process by which [[Epithelium|epithelial]] cells lose their [[cell polarity]] and cell-cell adhesion, and gain migratory and invasive properties to become [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s; these are [[multipotent]] [[stromal cell]]s that can differentiate into a variety of cell types. EMT is essential for numerous developmental processes including [[germ layer#Mesoderm|mesoderm]] formation and [[neural tube]] formation. EMT has also been shown to occur in [[wound healing]], in organ [[fibrosis]] and in the initiation of [[metastasis]] in cancer progression.

==Introduction==

Epithelial–mesenchymal transition was first recognized as a feature of embryogenesis by [[Betty Hay]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title=Cancer Stem Cells and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)-Phenotypic Cells: Are They Cousins or Twins?|url=|journal=Cancers (Basel)|volume=3|issue=1|pages=716–29|doi=10.3390/cancers30100716|pmc=3106306|pmid=21643534|vauthors=Kong D, Li Y, Wang Z, Sarkar FH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamouille|first=Samy|last2=Xu|first2=Jian|last3=Derynck|first3=Rik|date=March 2014|title=Molecular mechanisms of epithelial-mesenchymal transition|url=|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|volume=15|issue=3|pages=178–196|doi=10.1038/nrm3758|pmc=4240281|pmid=24556840}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMT, and its reverse process, MET ([[Mesenchymal–epithelial transition|mesenchymal-epithelial transition]]) are critical for development of many tissues and organs in the developing embryo, and numerous embryonic events such as [[gastrulation]], [[neural crest]] formation, [[heart valve]] formation, palatogenesis and [[myogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transitions in Development and Disease|url=|journal=Cell|volume=139|issue=5|pages=871–890|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2009.11.007|pmid=19945376|vauthors=Thiery JP, Acloque H, Huang YJ, Nieto MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epithelial and mesenchymal cells differ in phenotype as well as function, though both share inherent plasticity.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Epithelial cells are closely connected to each other by [[tight junction]]s, [[gap junction]]s and [[adherens junction]]s, have an apico-basal [[Cell polarity|polarity]], polarization of the [[Actin cytoskeleton|actin]] [[cytoskeleton]] and are bound by a [[basal lamina]] at their basal surface. Mesenchymal cells, on the other hand, lack this polarization, have a spindle-shaped morphology and interact with each other only through focal points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Complex networks orchestrate epithelial-mesenchymal transitions|url=|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|volume=7|issue=2|pages=131–142|doi=10.1038/nrm1835|pmid=16493418|vauthors=Thiery JP, Sleeman JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epithelial cells express high levels of [[E-cadherin]], whereas mesenchymal cells express those of [[N-cadherin]], [[fibronectin]] and [[vimentin]]. Thus, EMT entails profound morphological and phenotypic changes to a cell.

Based on the biological context, EMT has been categorized into 3 types : developmental (Type I), [[fibrosis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Martel|first2=N|last3=Pennisi|first3=DJ|last4=Little|first4=MH|last5=Wilkinson|first5=L|date=April 2013|title=Distinct sites of renal fibrosis in Crim1 mutant mice arise from multiple cellular origins|journal=The Journal of Pathology|volume=229|issue=5|pages=685–96|doi=10.1002/path.4155|pmid=23224993|last1=Phua|first1=YL}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wound healing]] (Type II), and [[cancer]] (Type III).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=The basics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition|url=|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|volume=119|issue=6|pages=1420–1428|doi=10.1172/JCI39104|pmc=2689101|pmid=19487818|vauthors=Kalluri R, Weinberg RA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sciacovelli|first=Marco|last2=Frezza|first2=Christian|date=2017-04-26|title=Metabolic reprogramming and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer|url=|journal=The FEBS Journal|doi=10.1111/febs.14090|pmid=28444969|pmc=6049610|volume=284|issue=19|pages=3132–3144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Linna|last2=Li|first2=Wenliang|date=June 2015|title=Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human cancer: comprehensive reprogramming of metabolism, epigenetics, and differentiation|url=|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics|volume=150|pages=33–46|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2015.01.004|pmid=25595324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss of [[E-cadherin]] is considered to be a fundamental event in EMT. Many [[transcription factor]]s (TFs) that can repress E-cadherin directly or indirectly can be considered as EMT-TF (EMT inducing TFs). [[SNAI1]]/Snail 1, [[SNAI2]]/Snail 2 (also known as Slug), [[ZEB1]], [[ZEB2]], [[TCF3]] and [[KLF8]] (Kruppel-like factor 8) can bind to the E-cadherin promoter and repress its transcription, whereas factors such as [[twist transcription factor|Twist]], [[Goosecoid protein|Goosecoid]], [[TCF4]] (also known as E2.2), homeobox protein [[SIX1]] and [[FOXC2]] (fork-head box protein C2) repress E-cadherin indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peinado H, Olmeda D, Cano A | title = Snail, Zeb and bHLH factors in tumour progression: an alliance against the epithelial phenotype? | journal = Nature Reviews Cancer | volume = 7 | issue = 6| pages = 415–428 | year = 2007 | url =  | doi=10.1038/nrc2131 | pmid=17508028| hdl = 10261/81769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang J, Weinberg RA | title = Epithelial-mesenchymal transition: at the crossroads of development and tumor metastasis | journal = Dev Cell | volume = 14 | pages = 818–829 | year = 2008 | url =| doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2008.05.009 | pmid=18539112 | issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; SNAIL and ZEB factors bind to E-box consensus sequences on the promoter region, while KLF8 binds to promoter through GT boxes. These EMT-TFs not only directly repress E-cadherin, but also repress transcriptionally other junctional proteins, including [[claudin]]s and [[desmosome]]s, thus facilitating EMT. On the other hand, transcription factors such as grainyhead-like protein 2 homologue (GRHL2), and ETS-related transcription factors ELF3 and [[ELF5]] are downregulated during EMT and are found to actively drive MET when overexpressed in mesenchymal cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=De Craene B, Berx G | title = Regulatory networks defining EMT during cancer initiation and progression | journal = Nature Reviews Cancer | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–110 | year = 2013 | doi= 10.1038/nrc3447| pmid = 23344542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chakrabarti R, Hwang J, Andres Blanco M, Wei Y, Lukačišin M, Romano RA, Smalley K, Liu S, Yang Q, Ibrahim T, Mercatali L, Amadori D, Haffty BG, Sinha S, Kang Y | title = Elf5 inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in mammary gland development and breast cancer metastasis by transcriptionally repressing Snail2 | journal = Nat Cell Biol | volume = 14 | issue=11 | pages = 1212–1222 | year = 2012 | doi= 10.1038/ncb2607 | pmid = 23086238 | pmc= 3500637 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since EMT in cancer progression recaptures EMT in developmental programs, many of the EMT-TFs are involved in promoting metastatic events.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nouri M, Ratther E, Stylianou N, Nelson CC, Hollier BG, Williams ED | year = 2014| title = Androgen-targeted therapy-induced epithelial mesenchymal plasticity and neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in prostate cancer: an opportunity for intervention | url = | journal = Front Oncol| volume =  4| issue = | pages =  370| pmid = 25566507 | doi=10.3389/fonc.2014.00370 | pmc=4274903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puisieux|first=Alain|last2=Brabletz|first2=Thomas|last3=Caramel|first3=Julie|date=June 2014|title=Oncogenic roles of EMT-inducing transcription factors|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb2976.pdf?origin=ppub|journal=Nature Cell Biology|volume=16|issue=6|pages=488–494|doi=10.1038/ncb2976|pmid=24875735|issn=1476-4679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In development and wound healing==

After the initial stage of embryogenesis, the implantation of the embryo and the initiation of [[placenta]] formation are associated with EMT. The trophoectoderm cells undergo EMT to facilitate the invasion of [[endometrium]] and appropriate placenta placement, thus enabling nutrient and gas exchange to the embryo. Later in embryogenesis, during gastrulation, EMT allows the cells to ingress in a specific area of the embryo – the [[primitive streak]] in [[amniotes]], and the ventral furrow in [[Drosophila]]. The cells in this tissue express E-cadherin and apical-basal polarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal|vauthors=Lim R, Thiery JP | title=Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions: insights from development| journal = Development | volume= 139 | issue= 19| pages= 3471–3486| year= 2012| doi= 10.1242/dev.071209 | pmid=22949611}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since gastrulation is a very rapid process, E-cadherin is repressed transcriptionally by [[twist transcription factor|Twist]] and [[SNAI1]] (commonly called ''Snail''), and at the protein level by P38 interacting protein. The primitive streak, through invagination, further generates mesoendoderm, which separates to form a mesoderm and an endoderm, again through EMT. Mesenchymal cells from the primitive streak participate also in the formation of many epithelial mesodermal organs, such as notochord as well as somites, through the reverse of EMT, i.e. [[mesenchymal–epithelial transition]]. [[Amphioxus]] forms an epithelial neural tube and dorsal notochord but does not have the EMT potential of the [[primitive streak]]. In higher chordates, the mesenchyme originates out of the primitive streak migrates anteriorly to form the somites and participate with neural crest mesenchyme in formation of the heart mesoderm.

In vertebrates, [[epithelium]] and [[mesenchyme]] are the basic tissue phenotypes. During embryonic development, migratory [[neural crest]] cells are generated by EMT involving the epithelial cells of the neuroectoderm. As a result, these cells dissociate from neural folds, gain motility, and disseminate to various parts of the embryo, where they differentiate to many other cell types. Also, craniofacial crest mesenchyme that forms the connective tissue forming the head and face, is formed by [[neural tube]] epithelium by EMT.&lt;ref name="pmid15937929"/&gt; EMT takes place during the construction of the vertebral column out of the [[extracellular matrix]], which is to be synthesized by [[fibroblast]]s and [[osteoblast]]s that encircle the neural tube. The major source of these cells are [[sclerotome]] and [[somite]] mesenchyme as well as [[primitive streak]]. Mesenchymal morphology allows the cells to travel to specific targets in the embryo, where they differentiate and/or induce differentiation of other cells.&lt;ref name="pmid15937929"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hay ED | title = The mesenchymal cell, its role in the embryo, and the remarkable signaling mechanisms that create it | journal=Dev.

During wound healing, keratinocytes at the border of the wound undergo EMT and undergo re-epithelialization or MET when the wound is closed. Snail2 expression at the migratory front influences this state, as its overexpression accelerates wound healing. Similarly, in each menstrual cycle, the ovarian surface epithelium undergoes EMT during post-ovulatory wound healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal|vauthors=Ahmed N, Maines-Bandiera S, Quinn MA, Unger WG, Dedhar S, Auersperg N | title= Molecular pathways regulating EGF-induced epithelio- mesenchymal transition in human ovarian surface epithelium | journal = Am J Physiol Cell Physiol | volume= 290 | issue= 6| pages= C1532–C1542 | year= 2006 | doi=10.1152/ajpcell.00478.2005| pmid= 16394028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, when these [[circulating tumor cell]]s (CTCs) exit the bloodstream to form micro-metastases, they undergo MET for clonal outgrowth at these metastatic sites. Thus, EMT and MET form the initiation and completion of the invasion-metastasis cascade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title=A perspective on cancer cell metastasis|url=|journal=Science|volume=331|issue=6024|pages=1559–1564|doi=10.1126/science.1203543|pmid=21436443|vauthors=Chaffer CL, Weinberg RA}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this new metastatic site, the tumor may undergo other processes to optimize growth.

EMT confers resistance to [[oncogene]]-induced premature [[senescence]]. Twist1 and Twist2, as well as [[ZEB1]] protects human cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts from senescence. Similarly, TGF-β can promote tumor invasion and evasion of immune surveillance at advanced stages. When TGF-β acts on activated Ras-expressing mammary epithelial cells, EMT is favored and apoptosis is inhibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal| author= Massague J | title= TGFβ in cancer| journal = Cell | volume= 134 | issue= 2| pages= 215–229 | year= 2008 | doi= 10.1016/j.cell.2008.07.001 | pmid=18662538 | pmc=3512574}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This effect can be reversed by inducers of epithelial differentiation, such as GATA-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chu IM, Lai WC, Aprelikova O, El Touny LH, Kouros-Mehr H, Green JE |title=Expression of GATA3 in MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells induces a growth inhibitory response to TGFß|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2013|volume=8|issue=4|pages=e61125|pmid=23577196|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0061125|pmc=3620110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EMT has been indicated to be involved in acquiring drug resistance. Gain of EMT markers was found to be associated with the resistance of ovarian carcinoma epithelial cell lines to paclitaxel.

Some evidence suggests that cells that undergo EMT gain stem cell-like properties, thus giving rise to [[Cancer Stem Cells]] (CSCs). Upon transfection by activated Ras, a subpopulation of cells exhibiting the putative stem cell markers CD44high/CD24low increases with the concomitant induction of EMT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mani SA, Guo W, Liao MJ, Eaton EN, Ayyanan A, Zhou AY, Brooks M, Reinhard F, Zhang CC, Shipitsin M, Campbell LL, Polyak K, Brisken C, Yang J, Weinberg RA |title=The epithelial-mesenchymal transition generates cells with properties of stem cells |journal=Cell |volume=133 |issue=4 |pages=704–15 |year=2008 |pmid=18485877 |pmc=2728032 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.03.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, ZEB1 is capable of conferring stem cell-like properties, thus strengthening the relationship between EMT and stemness. Thus, EMT may present increased danger to cancer patients, as EMT not only enables the carcinoma cells to enter the bloodstream, but also endows them with properties of stemness which increases tumorigenic and proliferative potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh A, Settleman J | title = EMT, cancer stem cells and drug resistance: an emerging axis of evil in the war on cancer | journal= Oncogene | volume = 29 | issue = 34 | pages = 4741–4751 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1038/onc.2010.215 | pmid=20531305 | pmc=3176718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Platelets in cancer EMT ==
[[File:Platelets in cancer EMT.jpg|thumb|490x490px|Cancer cells enter the bloodstream after undergoing EMT induced by TGF-β released from platelets. Once in the bloodstream, metastatic cancer cells recruit platelets for use as a physical barrier that helps protect these cells from elimination by immune cells. The metastatic cancer cell can use the attached platelets to adhere to P-selectin expressed by activated endothelial cells lining the blood vessel walls.

a state in which they retain some epithelial traits such as cell-cell adhesion or apico-basal polarity, and gain migratory traits, thus cells in this hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype are endowed with special properties such as collective cell migration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jolly|first=Mohit Kumar|last2=Boareto|first2=Marcelo|last3=Huang|first3=Bin|last4=Jia|first4=Dongya|last5=Lu|first5=Mingyang|last6=Ben-Jacob|first6=Eshel|last7=Onuchic|first7=José N.|last8=Levine|first8=Herbert|date=2015-01-01|title=Implications of the Hybrid Epithelial/Mesenchymal Phenotype in Metastasis|journal=Frontiers in Oncology|volume=5|pages=155|doi=10.3389/fonc.2015.00155|pmc=4507461|pmid=26258068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nakaya Y, Sheng G | title = EMT in developmental morphogenesis | journal=Cancer Lett | volume = 341 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–15 | year = 2013 |

'''Estate satire''' is a genre of writing from 14th Century, [[Medieval literature|Medieval literary]] works. The three Medieval estates were the Clergy (those who prayed), the [[Nobility]] (those who fought) and lastly the [[Peasantry]] (those who labored). These estates were the major [[social classes]] of the time and were typically gender specific to men, although the clergy also included nuns. Nevertheless, women were considered as a separate class in themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Jill. ''Chaucer and Medieval Estates Satire''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; the best-known example being [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s [[The Wife of Bath's Tale|Wife of Bath]]. Estates satire praised the glories and purity of each class in its ideal form, but was also used as a window to show how society had gotten out of hand. The ''Norton Anthology of [[English Literature]]'' describes the duty of estates satire: "They set forth the functions and duties of each estate and castigate the failure of the estates in the present world to live up to their divinely assigned social roles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estates Satire|work=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/middleages/topic_1/satire.htm|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|accessdate = 25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Estate, the Church, consisted of those who ran the Catholic church and part of the country. They were the recipients of the ''[[tithe]]'' or the 10% tax given to the Church.

The Second Estate, the Nobility, were royalty, not including the King. They were never taxed but could collect taxes from the Third Estate, and had other special privileges.

The Third Estate, the Commons, is the largest, consisting of around 96% of the population (UCL). The commons included everyone who did not belong to the first two estates, primarily rural [[peasants]] and the urban [[bourgeois]] or middle class. They had none of the privileges or luxuries that the first two estates enjoyed, although the [[History of capitalism|rise of capitalism]] in the late 14th Century resulted in the bourgeois having relatively more power.

Among 14th-century English authors, [[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], and Chaucer were three of the most prominent writers of the time to include estates satire in their works. Although Gower was more aggressive in his approach, Chaucer was more subtle and more successful, making himself to be the fool of the joke and subverting may of the conventions of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, ''Chaucer and Medieval Estates Satire''.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Medieval authors used estates satire to express their disgust towards the hypocrisy of the three estates and their supposed virtuous ways.

'''Experimental psychology''' refers to work done by those who apply [[Experiment|experimental methods]] to psychological study and the processes that underlie it. Experimental psychologists employ human participants and animal subjects to study a great many topics, including (among others) [[Perception|sensation &amp; perception]], [[memory]], [[cognition]], [[learning]], [[motivation]], [[emotion]]; [[Developmental psychology|developmental processes]], [[social psychology]], and the [[Neuroscience|neural substrates]] of all of these.&lt;ref&gt;Pashler, H.

=== Early experimental psychology ===

{{See also|Psychophysics}}

==== Wilhelm Wundt ====

{{Main article|Wilhelm Wundt}}
Experimental psychology emerged as a modern academic discipline in the 19th century when [[Wilhelm Wundt]] introduced a mathematical and experimental approach to the field. Wundt founded the first psychology laboratory in [[Leipzig, Germany]]&lt;!--DIGRESSION and the [[structuralist]] school of psychology--&gt;.&lt;ref name=Khaleefa&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Khaleefa | first1 = Omar | year = 1999 | title = Who Is the Founder of Psychophysics and Experimental Psychology? | url = | journal = American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences | volume = 16 | issue = | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experimental psychologists, including [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] and [[Edward Titchener]], included [[introspection]] among their experimental methods.

==== Charles Bell ====

{{Main article|Charles Bell}}
Charles Bell was a British [[Physiology|physiologist]], whose main contribution was research involving the [[Nervous_system|nervous system]].  He wrote a pamphlet summarizing his research on rabbits.  His research concluded that sensory nerves enter at the posterior (dorsal) roots of the spinal cord and motor nerves emerge from the anterior (ventral) roots of the spinal cord.  Eleven years later, a French physiologist Francois Magendie published the same findings without being aware of Bell’s research.  Due to Bell not publishing his research, the discovery was called the [[Bell-Magendie_law|Bell-Magendie law]].  Bell’s discovery disproved the belief that nerves transmitted either vibrations or spirits.

==== Ernst Heinrich Weber ====

{{Main article|Ernst Heinrich Weber}}
Weber was a German physician who is credited with being one of the founders of experimental psychology.  His main interests were the sense of touch and kinesthesis.  His most memorable contribution is the suggestion that judgments of sensory differences are relative and not absolute. This relativity is expressed in "Weber's Law," which suggests that the [[just-noticeable difference]], or '''jnd''' is a constant proportion of the ongoing stimulus level. Weber's Law is stated as an equation: 
: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\Delta I} {I} = k,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I\!&lt;/math&gt; is the original intensity of stimulation, &lt;math&gt;\Delta I\!&lt;/math&gt; is the addition to it required for the difference to be perceived (the '''jnd'''), and ''k'' is a constant.  Thus, for k to remain constant, &lt;math&gt;\Delta I\!&lt;/math&gt; must rise as '''I''' increases.  Weber’s law is considered the first quantitative law in the history of psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Hergenhahn, B.R. (2009) An Introduction to the History of Psychology. Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gustav Fechner ====

{{Main article|Gustav Fechner}}
Fechner published in 1860 what is considered to be the first work of experimental psychology, "Elemente der Psychophysik."&lt;ref name="Fraisse"&gt;Fraisse, P, Piaget, J, &amp; Reuchlin, M. (1963). Experimental psychology: its scope and method. 1. History and method. New York:  Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some historians date the beginning of experimental psychology from the publication of "Elemente."  Weber was not a psychologist, and it was Fechner who realized the importance of Weber’s research to psychology.  Fechner was profoundly interested in establishing a scientific study of the mind-body relationship, which became known as [[psychophysics]].  Much of Fechner's research focused on the measurement of psychophysical thresholds and [[just-noticeable difference]]s, and he invented the psychophysical method of limits, the method of constant stimuli, and the method of adjustment, which are still in use.

==== Oswald Külpe ====

{{Main article|Oswald Külpe}}
Oswald Külpe is the main founder of the Würzburg School in Germany.  He was a pupil of Wilhelm Wundt for about twelve years.  Unlike Wundt, Külpe believed experiments were possible to test higher mental processes.  In 1883 he wrote Grundriss der Psychologie, which had strictly scientific facts and no mention of thought.&lt;ref name="Fraisse" /&gt;  The lack of thought in his book is odd because the Würzburg School put a lot of emphasis on mental set and imageless thought.

==== Würzburg School ====

The work of the Würzburg School was a milestone in the development of experimental psychology.  The School was founded by a group of psychologists led by Oswald Külpe, and it provided an alternative to the [[structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]] of Edward Titchener and Wilhelm Wundt.  Those in the School focussed mainly on mental operations such as mental set (''Einstellung'') and imageless thought.  Mental set affects perception and problem solving without the awareness of the individual; it can be triggered by instructions or by experience. Similarly, according to Külpe, imageless thought consists of pure mental acts that do not involve mental images.  An example of mental set was provided by William Bryan, an American student working in Külpe’s laboratory.  Bryan presented subjects with cards that had nonsense syllables written on them in various colors.  The subjects were told to attend to the syllables, and in consequence they did not remember the colors of the nonsense syllables.  Such results made people question the validity of introspection as a research tool, and let to a decline of [[voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarism]] and structuralism.  The work of the Würzburg School later influenced many [[gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologists]], including [[Max Wertheimer]].

==== George Trumbull Ladd ====

{{main article|George Trumbull Ladd}}
Experimental psychology was introduced into the United States by [[George Trumbull Ladd]], who founded [[Yale University]]'s psychological laboratory in 1879. In 1887, Ladd published ''Elements of Physiological Psychology'', the first American textbook that extensively discussed experimental psychology. Between Ladd's founding of the Yale Laboratory and his textbook, the center of experimental psychology in the US shifted to [[Johns Hopkins University]], where [[George Hall (psychologist)|George Hall]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] were extending and qualifying Wundt's work.

==== Charles Sanders Peirce ====

To Peirce and to experimental psychology belongs the honor of having invented [[randomized experiment]]s, decades before the innovations of [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Ronald Fisher]] in agriculture.&lt;ref name="smalldiff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telepathy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stigler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dehue"/&gt;

Peirce's pragmaticist philosophy also included an extensive theory of mental representations and cognition, which he studied under the name of [[semiotics]].&lt;ref&gt;Liszka, J.J. (1996). ''A General Introduction to the Semeiotic of C.S. Peirce.'' Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce's student [[Joseph Jastrow]] continued to conduct randomized experiments throughout his distinguished career in experimental psychology, much of which would later be recognized as [[cognitive psychology]].

==== 20th century{{anchor|20th Century}} ====
In the middle of the 20th century, [[behaviorism]] became a dominant paradigm within psychology, especially in the [[United States]]. This led to some neglect of [[mind|mental]] phenomena within experimental psychology. In [[Europe]] this was less the case, as European psychology was influenced by psychologists such as [[Sir Frederic Bartlett]], [[Kenneth Craik]], [[W. E. Hick|W.E. Hick]] and [[Donald Broadbent]], who focused on topics such as [[thinking]], [[memory]] and [[attention]]. This laid the foundations for the subsequent development of cognitive psychology.

In the latter half of the 20th century, the phrase "experimental psychology" had shifted in meaning due to the expansion of psychology as a discipline and the growth in the size and number of its sub-disciplines. Experimental psychologists use a range of methods and do not confine themselves to a strictly experimental approach, partly because developments in the [[philosophy of science]] have affected the exclusive prestige of experimentation. In contrast, an experimental method is now widely used in fields such as developmental and [[social psychology]], which were not previously part of experimental psychology. The phrase continues in use, however, in the titles of a number of well-established, high prestige [[learned societies]] and [[scientific journals]], as well as some [[university]] courses of study in psychology.

== Methodology ==
{{Main article|Design of experiments}}
Sound methodology is essential to the study of complex behavioral and mental processes, and this implies, especially, the careful definition and control of experimental variables.

=== Some underlying assumptions of psychological science ===
{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  
As a scientific endeavor, experimental psychology shares several assumptions with most other sciences. Among these are the following.

==== Empiricism ====

Perhaps the most basic assumption of science is that factual statements about the world must ultimately be based on observations of the world. This notion of [[empiricism]] requires that hypotheses and theories be tested against observations of the natural world rather than on a priori reasoning, intuition, or revelation.

==== Testability ====

Closely related to empiricism is the idea that, to be useful, a scientific law or theory must be testable with available research methods. If a theory cannot be tested in any conceivable way then many scientists consider the theory to be meaningless. Testability implies [[falsifiability]], which is the idea that some set of observations could prove the theory to be incorrect .&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, P.R. (1992) A case for case studies: An immigrant's journal. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Testability has been emphasized in psychology because influential or well-known theories like those of Freud have been difficult to test.

==== Determinism ====

Experimental psychologists, like most scientists, accept the notion of [[determinism]]. This is the assumption that any state of an object or event is determined by prior states.  In other words, behavioral or mental phenomena are typically stated in terms of cause and effect. If a phenomenon is sufficiently general and widely confirmed, it may be called a "law"; psychological theories serve to organize and integrate laws.

==== Parsimony ====

Another guiding idea of science is parsimony, the search for simplicity.  For example, most scientists agree that if two theories handle a set of empirical observations equally well, we should prefer the simpler or more parsimonious of the two.  A notable early argument for parsimony was stated by the medieval English philosopher William of Occam, and for this reason the principle of parsimony is often referred to as [[Occam's razor]].&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, M. (1993). Occam's razor. London: Sinclair- Stevenson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Operational definition ====

Some well-known behaviorists such as [[Edward C. Tolman]] and [[Clark Hull]] popularized the idea of operationism, or operational definition. Operational definition implies that a concept be defined in terms of concrete, observable procedures. Experimental psychologists attempt to define currently unobservable phenomena, such as mental events, by connecting them to observations by chains of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benjafield | first1 = J. G. | year = 2013 | title = The vocabulary of anglophone psychology in the context of other subjects | url = | journal = History of Psychology | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 36–56 | doi = 10.1037/a0030532 | pmid = 23394175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiments ===
{{Main article|Experiment}}
In experiments, human participants often respond to visual, auditory or other stimuli, following instructions given by an experimenter; animals may be similarly "instructed" by rewarding appropriate responses. Since the 1990s, computers have commonly been used to automate stimulus presentation and behavioral measurement in the laboratory. Behavioral experiments with both humans and animals typically measure reaction time, choices among two or more alternatives, and/or response rate or strength; they may also record movements, facial expressions, or other behaviors. Experiments with humans may also obtain written responses before, during, and after experimental procedures. [[Psychophysiology|Psychophysiological]] experiments, on the other hand, measure brain or (mostly in animals) single-cell activation during the presentation of a stimulus using methods such as [[fMRI]], [[EEG]], [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] or similar.

Control of [[extraneous variables]], minimizing the potential for [[experimenter bias]], counterbalancing the order of experimental tasks, adequate [[sample size]], the use of [[operational definition]]s, emphasis on both the [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[validity (statistics)|validity]] of results, and proper [[statistical analysis]] are central to experimental methods in psychology. Because an understanding of these matters is important to the interpretation of data in almost all fields of psychology, undergraduate programs in psychology usually include mandatory courses in [[research]] methods and [[statistics]].

A '''crucial experiment''' is an experiment that is intended to test several hypotheses at the same time. Ideally, one hypothesis may be confirmed and all the others rejected.  However, the data may also be consistent with several hypotheses, a result that calls for further research to narrow down the possibilities.

A '''pilot study''' may be run before a major experiment, in order to try out different procedures, determine optimal values of the experimental variables, or uncover weaknesses in experimental design. The pilot study may not be an experiment as usually defined; it might, for example, consist simply of [[self-report study|self-reports]].&lt;ref&gt;McGuigan, F.J. (1997) Experimental Psychology: Methods of Research. New Jersey: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a '''[[field experiment]]''', participants are observed in a naturalistic setting outside the laboratory. Field experiments differ from field ''studies'' in that some part of the environment (''field'') is manipulated in a controlled way (for example, researchers give different kinds of toys to two different groups of children in a nursery school).  Control is typically more lax than it would be in a laboratory setting.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, G., Parkinson, S (1994) ''Experimental methods in psychology''. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods of research such as [[case study]], interview, [[opinion polls]] and [[naturalistic observation]], are often used by psychologists. These are not experimental methods, as they lack such aspects as well-defined, controlled variables, randomization, and isolation from unwanted variables.

=== Reliability and Validity ===

==== Reliability ====

Reliability measures the consistency or repeatability of an observation. For example, one way to assess reliability is the "test-retest" method, done by measuring a group of participants at one time and then testing them a second time to see if the results are consistent. Because the first test itself may alter the results of a second test, other methods are often used. For example, in the "split-half" measure, a group of participants is divided at random into two comparable sub-groups, and reliability is measured by comparing the test results from these groups,  It is important to note that a reliable measure need not yield a valid conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Fleiss, J. L. (1986). Reliability of measurement. The design and analysis of clinical experiments, 1-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Validity ====
Validity measures the relative accuracy or correctness of conclusions drawn from a study. To determine the validity of a measurement quantitatively, it must be compared with a criterion. For example, to determine the validity of a test of academic ability, that test might be given to a group of students and the results correlated with the grade-point averages of the individuals in that group. As this example suggests, there is often controversy in the selection of appropriate criteria for a given measure.   In addition, a conclusion can only be valid to the extent that the observations upon which it is based are reliable.

Several types of validity have been distinguished, as follows:

===== Internal validity =====

[[Internal validity]] refers to the extent to which a set of research findings provides compelling information about causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Thoemmes | first2 = F. | year = 2010 | title = Campbell's and Rubin's perspectives on causal inference | url = | journal = Psychological Methods | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 18–37 | doi = 10.1037/a0015917 | pmid = 20230100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; High internal validity implies that the experimental design of a study excludes extraneous influences, such that one can confidently conclude that variations in the independent variable caused any observed changes in the dependent variable.

===== External validity =====

[[External Validity]] refers to the extent to which the outcome of an experiment can be generalized to apply to other situations than those of the experiment - for example, to other people, other physical or social environments, or even other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berkowitz | first1 = L. | last2 = Donnerstein | first2 = E. | year = 1982 | title = External validity is more than skin deep: Some answers to criticisms of laboratory experiments | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 245–257 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.37.3.245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, M. (2000). Research Design and Issues of Validity. In Reis, H. &amp; Judd, C. (eds) Handbook of Research Methods in Social and Personality Psychology. Cambridge:Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Construct validity =====

Construct validity refers to the extent to which the independent and dependent variables in a study represent the abstract hypothetical variables of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = L. A. | last2 = King | first2 = D. W. | year = 1990 | title = Role conflict and role ambiguity: A critical assessment of construct validity | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 107 | issue = 1| pages = 48–64 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.107.1.48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it has to do with whether the manipulated and/or measured variables in a study accurately reflect the variables the researcher hoped to manipulate. Construct validity also reflects the quality of one’s operational definitions. If a researcher has done a good job of converting the abstract to the observable, construct validity is high.

===== Conceptual validity =====

Conceptual validity refers to how well specific research maps onto the broader theory that it was designed to test. Conceptual and construct validity have a lot in common, but conceptual validity relates a study to broad theoretical issues whereas construct validity has more to do with specific manipulations and measures.

=== Scales of measurement ===
{{Main article|Units of measurement|Systems of measurement|Level of measurement}}

Measurement can be defined as "the assignment of numerals to objects or events according to rules."&lt;ref name = "Torg"&gt;Torgerson, W. S. (1962) Theory and Methods of Scaling. New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Stevens"&gt;Stevens, S. S. (1951) Mathematics, Measurement and Psychophysics in S. S. Stevens (Ed) Handbook of Experimental Psychology. New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;
Almost all psychological experiments involve some sort of measurement, if only to determine the reliability and validity of results, and of course measurement is essential if results are to be relevant to quantitative theories.

The rule for assigning numbers to a property of an object or event is called a "scale".    Following are the basic scales used in psychological measurement.&lt;ref name = "Stevens"/&gt;

==== Nominal measurement ====
In a nominal scale, numbers are used simply as labels – a letter or name would do as well.  Examples are the numbers on the shirts of football or baseball players. The labels are more useful if the same label can be given to more than one thing, meaning that the things are equal in some way, and can be classified together.

==== Ordinal measurement ====
An ordinal scale arises from the ordering or ranking objects, so that A is greater than B, B is greater than C, and so on.  Many psychological experiments yield numbers of this sort; for example, a participant might be able to rank odors such that A is more pleasant than B, and B is more pleasant than C, but these rankings ("1, 2, 3 ...") would not tell by how much each odor differed from another. Some statistics can be computed from ordinal measures – for example, [[median]], percentile, and [[Correlation and dependence|order correlation]] – but others, such as [[standard deviation]], cannot properly be used.

==== Interval measurement ====
An interval scale is constructed by determining the equality of differences between the things measured. That is, numbers form an interval scale when the differences between the numbers correspond to differences between the properties measured. For instance, one can say that the difference between 5 and 10 degrees on a Fahrenheit thermometer equals the difference between 25 and 30, but it is meaningless to say that something with a temperature of 20 degrees Fahrenheit is "twice as hot" as something with a temperature of 10 degrees. (Such ratios are meaningful on an [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature scale]] such as the Kelvin scale. See next section.) "Standard scores" on an achievement test are said to be measurements on an interval scale, but this is difficult to prove.&lt;ref name = "Stevens"/&gt;

==== Ratio measurement ====
A ratio scale is constructed by determining the equality of ratios. For example, if, on a balance instrument, object A balances two identical objects B, then one can say that A is twice as heavy as B and can give them appropriate numbers, for example "A weighs 2 grams" and "B weighs 1 gram". A key idea is that such ratios remain the same regardless of the scale units used; for example, the ratio of A to B remains the same whether grams or ounces are used.  Length, resistance, and Kelvin temperature are other things that can be measured on ratio scales.  Some psychological properties such as the loudness of a sound can be measured on a ratio scale.&lt;ref name = "Stevens"/&gt;

=== Research design ===

==== One-way designs ====

The simplest experimental design is a one-way design, in which there is only one independent variable. The simplest kind of one-way design involves just two-groups, each of which receives one value of the independent variable.  A two-group design typically consists of an [[experimental group]] (a group that receives treatment) and a [[control group]] (a group that does not receive treatment).&lt;ref&gt;Kline, R. B. (2004). Effect Size Estimation in Multifactor Designs. In ''Beyond significance testing: Reforming data analysis methods in behavioral research'' (pp. 203-243). Washington, DC US: American Psychological Association. {{DOI|10.1037/10693-007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The one-way design may be expanded to a one-way, multiple groups design. Here a single independent variable takes on three or more levels.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, R. B. (2004). Effect Size Estimation in One-Way Designs. In ''Beyond significance testing: Reforming data analysis methods in behavioral research'' (pp. 163-202). Washington, DC US: American Psychological Association. {{DOI|10.1037/10693-006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of design is particularly useful because it can help to outline a functional relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

==== Factorial designs ====

One-way designs are limited in that they allow researchers to look at only one independent variable at a time, whereas many phenomena of interest are dependent on multiple variables. Because of this, [[R.A Fisher]] popularized the use of factorial designs. [[Factorial designs]] contain two or more independent variables that are completely "crossed," which means that every level each independent variable appears in combination with every level of all other independent variables. Factorial designs carry labels that specify the number of independent variables and the number of levels of each independent variable there are in the design. For example, a 2x3 factorial design has two independent variables (because there are two numbers in the description), the first variable having two levels and the second having three.

==== Main effects and interactions ====

The effects of [[independent variables]] in factorial studies, taken singly, are referred to as main effects. This refers to the overall effect of an independent variable, averaging across all levels of the other independent variables. A main effect is the only effect detectable in a one-way design.&lt;ref&gt;Xu, L., Yang, F., Abula, A., &amp; Qin, S. (2013). A parametric bootstrap approach for [[two-way ANOVA]] in presence of possible interactions with unequal variances. Journal of Multivariate Analysis, 115172-180. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jmva.2012.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often more important than main effects are "interactions", which occur when the effect of one independent variable on a dependent variable depends on the level of a second independent variable. For example, the ability to catch a ball (dependent variable) might depend on the interaction of visual acuity (independent variable #1) and the size of the ball being caught (independent variable #2).  A person with good eyesight might catch a small ball most easily, and person with very poor eyesight might do better with a large ball, so the two variables can be said to interact.

==== Within- and between-subjects designs ====

Two basic approaches to [[research design]] are within-subjects design and [[between-subjects design]]. In within-subjects or repeated measures designs, each participant serves in more than one or perhaps all of the conditions of a study. In between-subjects designs each participant serves in only one condition of an experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charness | first1 = G. | last2 = Gneezy | first2 = U. | last3 = Kuhn | first3 = M. A. | year = 2012 | title = Experimental methods: Between-subject and within-subject design | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization | volume = 81 | issue = 1| pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1016/j.jebo.2011.08.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within-subjects designs have significant advantages over between-subjects designs, especially when it comes to complex factorial designs that have many conditions. In particular, within-subjects designs eliminate person confounds, that is, they get rid of effects caused by differences among subjects that are irrelevant to the phenomenon under study.  However, the within-subject design has the serious disadvantage of possible sequence effects. Because each participant serves in more than one condition, the passage of time or the performance of an earlier task may affect the performance of a later task. For example, a participant might learn something from the first task that affects the second.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brooks | first1 = J. L. | year = 2012 | title = Counterbalancing for serial order carryover effects in experimental condition orders | url = | journal = Psychological Methods | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 600–614 | doi = 10.1037/a0029310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimental instruments ==

Instruments used in experimental psychology evolved along with technical advances and with the shifting demands of experiments. The earliest instruments, such as the Hipp Chronoscope and the kymograph, were originally used for other purposes. The list below exemplifies some of the different instruments used over the years.

=== Hipp chronoscope / chronograph ===

This instrument, dating from around 1850, uses a vibrating reed to tick off time in 1000ths of a second. Originally designed for experiments in physics, it was later adapted to study the speed of bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sturm | first1 = T. | last2 = Ash | first2 = M.G | year = 2005 | title = Roles of instruments in psychological research | url = | journal = History of Psychology | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 3–34 | doi=10.1037/1093-4510.8.1.3| pmid = 16021762 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   After then being introduced to physiology, it was finally used in psychology to measure reaction time and the duration of mental processes.

=== Stereoscope ===

{{main article|Stereoscope}}
The first stereoscope was invented by Wheatstone in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wheatstone | first1 = C | year = 1838 | title = On some remarkable and hitherto unobserved phenomena of binocular vision | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 128 | issue = | pages = 371–394 | doi=10.1098/rstl.1838.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It presents two slightly different images, one to each eye, at the same time. Typically the images are photographs of the same object taken from camera positions that mimic the position and separation of the eyes in the head. When one looks through the steroscope the photos fuse into a single image that conveys a powerful sense of depth and solidity.

=== Kymograph ===

Developed by Carl Ludwig in the 19th century, the kymograph is a revolving drum on which a moving stylus tracks the size of some measurement as a function of time.  The kymograph is similar to the polygraph, which has a strip of paper moving under one or more pens. The kymograph was originally used to measure blood pressure and it later was used to measure muscle contractions and speech sounds.  In psychology, it was often used to record response times.

=== Photokymographs ===

This device is a photographic recorder.  It used mirrors and light to record the photos.  Inside a small box with a slit for light there are two drive rollers with film connecting the two.  The light enters through the slit to record on the film.  Some photokymographs have a lens so an appropriate speed for the film can be reached.

=== Galvanometer ===

{{Main article|Galvanometer}}

The galvanometer is an early instrument used to measure the strength of an electric current.  Hermann von Helmholtz used it to detect the electrical signals generated by nerve impulses, and thus to measure the time taken by impulses to travel between two points on a nerve.

=== Audiometer ===

This apparatus was designed to produce several fixed frequencies at different levels of intensity.  It could either deliver the tone to a subject’s ear or transmit sound oscillations to the skull.  An experimenter would generally use an audiometer to find the auditory threshold of a subject.  The data received from an audiometer is called an audiogram.

=== Colorimeters ===

These determine the color composition by measuring its tricolor characteristics or matching of a color sample.  This type of device would be used in visual experiments.&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt;

=== Algesiometers and algometers ===

Both of these are mechanical stimulations of pain. They have a sharp needle-like stimulus point so it does not give the sensation of pressure. Experimenters use these when doing an experiment on analgesia.

=== Olfactometer ===

An olfactometer is any device that is used to measure the sense of smell.  The most basic type in early studies was placing a subject in a room containing a specific measured amount of an odorous substance.  More intricate devices involve some form of sniffing device, such as the neck of a bottle.  The most common olfactometer found in psychology laboratories at one point was the Zwaardemker olfactometer.  It had two glass nasal tubes projecting through a screen.  One end would be inserted into a stimulus chamber, the other end is inserted directly into the nostrils.

=== Mazes ===

Probably one of the oldest instruments for studying memory would be the maze.  The common goal is to get from point A to point B, however the mazes can vary in size and complexity.  Two types of mazes commonly used with rats are the radial arm maze and the Morris water maze.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, J., &amp; Quenzer, L. (2005) Psychopharmacology: Drugs, the Brain, and Behavior. Sinauer Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[radial arm maze]] consists of multiple arms radiating from a central point.  Each arm has a small piece of food at the end.  The Morris water maze is meant to test spatial learning.  It uses a large round pool of water that is made opaque.  The rat must swim around until it finds the escape platform that is hidden from view just below the surface of the water.

=== Electroencephalograph (EEG) ===

{{Main article|Electroencephalography}}

The EEG is an instrument that can reflect the summed electrical activity of neural cell assemblies in the brain.  It was originally used as an attempt to improve medical diagnoses.  Later it became a key instrument to psychologists in examining brain activity and it remains a key instrument used in the field today.

=== Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) ===

{{Main article|Functional magnetic resonance imaging}}

The fMRI is an instrument that can detect changes in blood oxygen levels over time.  The increase in blood oxygen levels shows where brain activity occurs.  These are rather bulky and expensive instruments which are generally found in hospitals.  They are most commonly used for cognitive experiments.

=== Positron emission tomography (PET) ===

{{Main article|Positron emission tomography}}

PET is also used to look at brain activity.  It can detect drugs binding neurotransmitter receptors in the brain.  A down side to PET is that it requires radioisotopes to be injected into the body so the brain activity can be mapped out.  The radioisotopes decay quickly so they do not accumulate in the body.

== Some research areas that employ experimental methods ==
The use of experimental methods was perhaps the main characteristic by which psychology became distinguishable from philosophy in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hearst, E. (1979) The First Century of Experimental Psychology. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since then experiments have been an integral part of most psychological research.  Following is a sample of some major areas that use experimental methods.

=== Cognitive psychology ===

{{Main article|Cognitive psychology}}

Some of the major topics studied by cognitive psychologists are [[memory]], [[learning]], [[problem solving]], and [[attention]].  Most cognitive experiments are done in a lab instead of a social setting; this is done mainly to provide maximum control of experimental variables and minimal interference from irrelevant events and other aspects of the situation. A great many experimental methods are used; frequently used methods are described on the main pages of the topics just listed. In addition to studying behavior, experimenters may use fMRI or PET so they are able to see what areas of the brain are active during cognitive processing.

==== Animal cognition ====

{{Main article|Animal cognition}}

Animal cognition refers to the mental capacities of non-human animals, and research in this field often focuses on matters similar to those of interest to cognitive psychologists using human participants.  Cognitive studies using animals can often control conditions more closely and use methods not open to research with humans. In addition, processes such as conditioning my appear in simpler form in animals, certain animals display unique capacities (such as echo location in bats) that clarify important cognitive functions, and animal studies often have important implications for the survival and evolution of species.

=== Sensation and perception ===

{{Main article|Sensation (psychology)}}

Experiments on sensation and perception have a very long history in experimental psychology (see History above).  Experimenters typically manipulate stimuli affecting vision, hearing, touch, smell, taste and proprioception.  Sensory measurement plays a large role in the field, covering many aspects of sensory performance - for example, minimum discriminable differences in brightness or the detection of odors; such measurement involves the use of instruments such as the oscillator, attenuator, stroboscope, and many others listed earlier in this article.  Experiments also probe subtle phenomena such as visual illusions, or the emotions aroused by stimuli of different sorts.

=== Behavioral psychology ===

{{Main article|Behaviorism}}
{{See also|Operant Conditioning}}
{{See also|Classical Conditioning}}

The behavioristic approach to psychology reached its peak of popularity in the mid twentieth century but still underlies much experimental research and clinical application. Its founders include such figures as [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[John B. Watson]], and [[B.F. Skinner]].  Pavlov's experimental study of the digestive system in dogs led to extensive experiments through which he established the basic principles of classical conditioning. Watson popularized the behaviorist approach to human behavior; his experiments with [[Little Albert experiment|Little Albert]] are particularly well known.  Skinner distinguished [[operant conditioning]] from [[classical conditioning]] and established the experimental analysis of behavior as a major component in the subsequent development of experimental psychology.

=== Social psychology ===

{{Main article|Social psychology}}
Social psychologists use experimental methods, both within and outside the laboratory, in an attempt to understand human social interaction.  Two widely cited experiments in social psychology experiment are the [[Stanford prison experiment]] conducted by [[Philip Zimbardo]] in 1971 and the [[Milgram experiment|Milgram obedience experiment]] by [[Stanley Milgram]].  In both experiments ordinary individuals were induced to engage in remarkably cruel behavior, suggesting that such behavior can be very strongly influenced by social pressure. Because of possible negative effects on the participants, neither of these experiments could be legally performed in the United States today.

== Institutional review board (IRB) ==
{{Main article|Institutional review board}}

In the United States, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) play an important role in monitoring the conduct of psychological experiments. Their presence is required by law at institutions such a universities where psychological research occurs. Their purpose is to make sure that experiments do not violate ethical codes or legal requirements; thus they protect human subjects from physical or psychological harm and assure the humane treatment of animal subjects.  An IRB must review the procedure to be used in each experiment before that experiment may begin. The IRB also assures that human participants give informed consent in advance; that is, the participants are told the general nature of the experiment and what will be required of them. There are three types of review that may be undertaken by an IRB - exempt, expedited, and full review. More information is available on the main IRB page.&lt;ref&gt;Bronte-Tinkew, J., Allen, T., &amp; Joyner, K. (2008) Institutional Review Boards (IRBs): What are they and why are they important? Atlantic Philanthropies.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
There have been several criticisms of experimental psychology.

=== Frankfurt school ===

{{See also|Frankfurt school|Herbert Marcuse|Theodore Adorno|Jürgen Habermas|Karl Popper|Alasdair MacIntyre}}
One school opposed to experimental psychology has been associated with the Frankfurt School, which calls its ideas "[[Critical Theory]]." [[Critical psychologist]]s claim that experimental psychology approaches humans as entities independent of the cultural, economic, and historical context in which they exist. These contexts of human mental processes and behavior are neglected, according to critical psychologists, like [[Herbert Marcuse]]. In so doing, experimental psychologists paint an inaccurate portrait of human nature while lending tacit support to the prevailing social order, according to critical theorists like [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]] (in their essays in ''The Positivist Debate in German Sociology'').

[[Critical theory]] has itself been criticized, however. While the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] "never took their methodology (whatever that may mean) seriously" (p.&amp;nbsp;289), Popper wrote counter-criticism to reduce the {{"'}}irrationalist' and 'intelligence-destroying{{'"}} "political influence" of critical theorists on students ([[Karl Popper]] pages 288–300 in ''[The Positivist Debate in German Sociology]''). The critical theorists Adorno and Marcuse have been severely criticized by [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] in ''Herbert Marcuse: An Exposition and Polemic''. Like Popper, MacIntyre attacked critical theorists like Adorno and especially Marcuse as obscurantists pontificating dogma in the authoritarian fashion of German professors of philosophy of their era—before World War II—(page 11); Popper made a similar criticism of critical theory's rhetoric, which reflected the culture of [[Hegelian]] [[social studies]] in [[German universities]] (pp.&amp;nbsp;293–94). Furthermore, MacIntyre ridiculed Marcuse as being a [[ultra-leftism|senile]] revival of the [[young Hegelian]] [[Theses on Feuerbach|tradition]] [[The German Ideology|criticized]] by [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[F. Engels|Engels]] (pp.&amp;nbsp;18–19, 41, and 101); similarly, "critical theory{{"'}}s revival of [[young Hegelianism]] and its criticism by Karl Marx was noted by Popper (p.&amp;nbsp;293). Marcuse's support for the political re-education camps of [[Cultural Revolution|Maoist China]] was also criticized as [[totalitarian]] by MacIntyre (pp.&amp;nbsp;101–05). More recently, the [[Critical Theory]] of Adorno and Marcuse has been criticized as being a degeneration of the original [[Frankfurt school]], particularly the work of empirical psychologist [[Erich Fromm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3341480 |title=Origin Myths in the Social Sciences: Fromm, the Frankfurt School and the Emergence of Critical Theory |author=Neil McLaughlin |journal=Canadian Journal of Sociology |volume=24 |issue=1 |date=Winter 1999 |pages=109–139 |jstor=3341480 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who did surveys and experiments to study the development of personality in response to economic stress and social change (Michael Macoby's Preface to Fromm's ''[http://www.transactionpub.com/title/Social-Character-in-a-Mexican-Village-978-1-56000-876-7.html Social Character in a Mexican Village]'').

GenoCAD facilitates the design of protein expression vectors, artificial gene networks and other genetic constructs for [[genetic engineering]] and is based on the theory of [[formal languages]].&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt; GenoCAD can be used online at [http://www.genocad.com www.genocad.com].

==History==
GenoCAD originated as an offshoot of an attempt to formalize functional constraints of genetic constructs using the theory of [[formal languages]]. In 2007, the website genocad.org (now retired) was set up as a proof of concept by researchers at [[Virginia Bioinformatics Institute]], [[Virginia Tech]]. Using the website, users could design genes by repeatedly replacing high-level genetic constructs with lower level genetic constructs, and eventually with actual [[DNA]] sequences.&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt;

On August 31, 2009, the [[National Science Foundation]] granted a three-year $1,421,725 grant to Dr. Jean Peccoud, an associate professor at the [[Virginia Bioinformatics Institute]] at [[Virginia Tech]], for the development of GenoCAD.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; GenoCAD was and continues to be developed by GenoFAB, a company founded by Peccoud (currently [[Chief science officer|CSO]] and acting [[CEO]]), who was also one of the authors of the originating study.&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt;

Source code for GenoCAD was originally released on [[Sourceforge]] in December 2009.&lt;ref name=commit&gt;{{cite web|title=GenoCAD Code|url=http://sourceforge.net/p/genocad/code/commit_browser|work=Sourceforge|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GenoCAD version 2.0 was released in November 2011 and included the ability to simulate the behavior of the designed genetic code. This feature was a result of a collaboration with the team behind [[COPASI]].&lt;ref name="release notes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=Mandy |title=GenoCAD Release Notes |url=http://peccoud.vbi.vt.edu/genocad-release-notes/ |work=Peccoud Lab |accessdate=8 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013161353/http://peccoud.vbi.vt.edu/genocad-release-notes/ |archivedate=13 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 2015, Peccoud and colleagues published a library of biological parts, called GenoLIB, that can be incorporated into the GenoCAD platform.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:GenoCAD workflow.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Workflow of GenoCAD]]
 
* '''Management of genetic sequences''': The purpose of this group of features is to help users identify, within large collections of genetic parts, the parts needed for a project and to organize them in project-specific libraries.
** ''Genetic parts'': Parts have a unique identifier, a name and a more general description. They also have a [[DNA sequence]]. Parts are associated with a [[formal grammar|grammar]] and assigned to a parts category such a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]], [[gene]], etc.
** ''Parts libraries'': Collections of parts are organized in libraries. In some cases part libraries correspond to parts imported from a single source such as another [[sequence database]]. In other cases, libraries correspond to the parts used for a particular design project. Parts can be moved from one library to another through a temporary storage area called the cart (analogous to e-commerce shopping carts).
** ''Searching parts'': Users can search the parts database using the [[Lucene]] search engine. Basic and advanced search modes are available. Users can develop complex queries and save them for future reuse.
** ''Importing/Exporting parts'': Parts can be imported and exported individually or as entire libraries using standard file formats (e.g., [[tab delimited]], [[FASTA]], [[SBML]]).
* '''Combining sequences into genetic constructs''': The purpose of this group of features is to streamline the process of combining genetic parts into designs compliant with a specific design strategy.
** ''Point-and-click design tool'': This [[Wizard (software)|wizard]] guides the user through a series of design decisions that determine the design structure and the selection of parts included in the design.
** ''Design management'': Designs can be saved in the user [[workspace]]. Design statuses are regularly updated to warn users of the consequences of editing parts on previously saved designs.
** ''Exporting designs'': Designs can be exported using standard file formats (e.g., [[GenBank]], [[tab delimited]], [[FASTA]]).
** ''Design safety'': Designs are protected from some types of errors by forcing the user to follow the appropriate design strategy. 
** ''Simulation'': Sequences designed in GenoCAD can be simulated to display chemical production in the resulting cell.&lt;ref name="Cai"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cai | first1 = Y. | last2 = Lux | first2 = M.

* '''User workspace''': Users can personalize their [[workspace]] by adding parts to the GenoCAD database, creating specialized libraries corresponding to specific design projects, and saving designs at different stages of development.

==Theoretical foundation==
GenoCAD is rooted in the theory of [[formal languages]]; in particular, the design rules describing how to combine different kinds of parts and form [[context-free grammar]]s.

&lt;/ref&gt;

A context free grammar can be defined by its terminals, variables, start variable and substitution rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Third edition|year=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA, USA|isbn=978-1-133-18779-0|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In GenoCAD, the terminals of the grammar are sequences of [[DNA]] that perform a particular biological purpose (e.g. a [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]]). The variables are less homogeneous: they can represent longer sequences that have multiple functions or can represent a section of DNA that can contain one of multiple different sequences of DNA but perform the same function (e.g. a variable represents the set of promoters). GenoCAD includes built in substitution rules to ensure that the DNA sequence is biologically viable. Users can also define their own sets of rules for other purposes.

Designing a sequence of DNA in GenoCAD is much like creating a derivation in a context free grammar. The user starts with the start variable and repeatedly selects a variable and a substitution for it until only terminals are left.&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''higher-order abstract syntax''' (abbreviated '''HOAS''') is a technique for the representation of [[abstract syntax tree]]s for languages with variable [[name binding|binders]].

==Relation to first-order abstract syntax==

An abstract syntax tree is ''abstract'' because it is a [[mathematical object]] that has certain structure by its very nature. For instance, in ''[[first-order abstract syntax]]'' (''FOAS'') trees, as commonly used in [[compiler]]s, the tree structure implies the subexpression relation, meaning that no parentheses are required to disambiguate programs (as they are in the [[concrete syntax]]). HOAS exposes additional structure: the relationship between variables and their binding sites. In FOAS representations, a variable is typically represented with an identifier, with the relation between binding site and use being indicated by using the ''same'' identifier. With HOAS, there is no name for the variable; each use of the variable refers directly to the binding site.

There are a number of reasons why this technique is useful. First, it makes the binding structure of a program explicit: just as there is no need to explain operator precedence in a FOAS representation, there is no need to have the rules of binding and scope at hand to interpret a HOAS representation. Second, programs that are 
[[lambda calculus|alpha-equivalent]] (differing only in the names of bound variables) have identical representations in HOAS, which can make equivalence checking more efficient. &lt;!-- other uses? --&gt;

==Implementation==

One mathematical object that could be used to implement HOAS is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] where variables are associated with their binding sites via [[edge (graph theory)|edges]]. Another popular way to implement HOAS (in, for example, compilers) is with [[de Bruijn index|de Bruijn indices]].

==Use in logical frameworks==
In the domain of [[logical framework]]s, the term higher-order abstract syntax is usually used to refer to a specific representation that uses the binders of the [[metalanguage|meta-language]] to encode the binding structure of the [[object language]].

For instance, the logical framework [[LF (logical framework)|LF]] has a λ-construct, which has arrow
(→) type. A first-order encoding of an object language construct &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; would be (using [[Twelf]]
syntax):

 exp : type.
 var : type.
 v : var -&gt; exp.
 let : exp -&gt; var -&gt; exp -&gt; exp.

Here, &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; is the family of object language expressions. The family &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; is the representation of variables (implemented perhaps as natural numbers, which is not shown); the constant &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; witnesses the fact that variables are expressions. The constant &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; is an expression that takes three arguments: an expression (that is being bound), a variable (that it is bound to) and another expression (that the variable is bound within).

The [[canonical form|canonical]] HOAS representation of the same object language would be:

 exp : type.
 let : exp -&gt; (exp -&gt; exp) -&gt; exp.

In this representation, object level variables do not appear explicitly. The constant &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; takes an expression (that is being bound) and a meta-level function &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; 
(the body of the let). This function is the ''higher-order'' part: an expression with a free variable is
represented as an expression with ''holes'' that are filled in by the meta-level function when applied. As a concrete example, we would construct the object level expression

 let x = 1 + 2
 in x + 3

(assuming the natural constructors for numbers and addition) using the HOAS signature above as

 let (plus 1 2) ([y] plus y 3)

where &lt;code&gt;[y] e&lt;/code&gt; is Twelf's syntax for the function &lt;math&gt;\lambda y.e&lt;/math&gt;.

This specific representation has advantages beyond the ones above: for one, by reusing the meta-level notion of binding, the encoding enjoys properties such as type-preserving ''substitution'' without the need to define/prove them. In this way using HOAS can drastically reduce the amount of [[boilerplate code]] having to do with binding in an encoding.

Higher-order abstract syntax is generally only applicable when object language variables can be understood as variables in the mathematical sense (that is, as stand-ins for arbitrary members of some domain). This is often, but not always, the case: for instance, there are no advantages to be gained from a HOAS encoding of [[scope (programming)#Dynamic scoping|dynamic scope]] as it appears in some dialects of [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] because dynamically scoped variables do not act like mathematical variables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19793">'''Hip hop studies''' is a multidisciplinary field of study that encompasses sociology, anthropology, communication and rhetoric studies, religious studies, [[cultural studies]], [[critical race theory]], [[Missiology|missiological studies]], [[art history]], [[dance]], [[musicology]], [[ethnomusicology]], [[music theory]], and [[gender studies]].&lt;ref name=JHHS2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Monica|last2=Hodge|first2=Daniel White|last3=Coleman|first3=Jeffery|last4=Chaney|first4=Cassandra|title=The Hip in Hip Hop: Toward a Discipline of Hip Hop Studies|journal=Journal of Hip Hop Studies|date=2014|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://savethekidsgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/JHHS-Volume-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "hip hop studies" began circulating in the mid-2000s, and though it is not clear who first coined the term to label the field, the field of hip hop studies is oft cited as having been crystallized by the publication of ''That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader'' in 2003.&lt;ref name=TTJ2004&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Forman|editor1-first=Murray|editor2-last=Neal|editor2-first=Marc Anthony|title=That's the Joint: The Hip Hop Studies Reader|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415969192|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''That's the Joint!'' includes approximately 25 years of scholarship, criticism, and journalism. The publication of this anthology was unprecedented, and highlights the evolving and continuous influence of  "one of the most creative and contested elements of global popular culture since its advent in the late 1970s."&lt;ref name=TTJ2004 /&gt; The publication of the first edition of ''That's the Joint!'' marked a consolidating moment for the field of hip hop studies because it brought together key writings on hip hop from a diversity of hip hop authorities.&lt;ref name=TTJ2004 /&gt;

[[Hip hop culture]], rooted in the 1970s post-industrial South Bronx, is polyvocal and is represented in five cultural modes: [[rap music]] (oral), [[turntablism]] or "[[DJing]]" (aural), [[B-boying|breaking]] (physical), [[graffiti]] art (visual), and knowledge (mental).&lt;ref name=JHHS2014 /&gt; Hip hop has, and continues to produce a remarkable array of thinkers who embody complex ideological makeups exemplified through their performances as writers, artists, poets, and scholars.&lt;ref name=HHMatters2005&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watkins|first1=S.

From spoken-word artists to academic scholars hip-hop intellectuals are translating the movement into a vast mix of critical commentary and artistic expression. The results both energize and expand the image and imagination of the hip-hop intelligentsia."&lt;ref name="hip-hop intelligentsia" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hip hop studies is part of the larger [[Hip hop|hip hop movement]].&lt;ref name=HHMatters2005 /&gt; The research and teaching in this interdisciplinary field includes analyses of technology, pop culture, linguistics, globalization, geography, race, electoral politics, and a variety of aspects related to contemporary culture, as scholars attempt to critically assess hip hop as a movement.&lt;ref name=HHMatters2005 /&gt; Scholarship in hip hop studies is rooted in the foundational, Afro-diasporic [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] mechanism within hip hop culture.&lt;ref name=ForemanInterview&gt;{{cite news|last1=Forman|first1=Murray|title='That's The Joint': A Scholarly Study of Hip-Hop|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4458410|accessdate=26 April 2015|agency=NPR|date=19 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodologies ==
{{Quote|text=The methodologies of examining hip hop are borrowed from sociology, politics, religion, economics, urban studies, journalism, communications theory, American studies, transatlantic studies, black studies, history, musicology, comparative literature, English, linguistics, and other disciplines.|sign=[[Michael Eric Dyson]]|source=''[https://www.amazon.com/Know-What-Mean-Reflections-Hip-Hop/dp/0465018076 Know What I Mean?: Reflections on Hip-Hop]''(2007)}}

Hip hop studies' [[methodologies]], or methods of systematic inquiry and analysis, are drawn from a range of academic disciplines including anthropology, sociology, political science, history, linguistics, economics, performance studies, media and communicative studies, American studies, musicology, English and literature, women's and gender studies, and black studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dyson|first1=Michael Eric|title=Know What I Mean? Reflections on Hip Hop|date=2010|publisher=Basic Civitas Books|location=New York|url=https://www.amazon.com/Know-What-Mean-Reflections-Hip-Hop/dp/0465018076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greg Dimitriadis, formerly a professor in the Graduate School of Education at the University of Buffalo, was an academic who critically examined, amongst other topics, hip hop methodologies; writing "Questions of method are, at heart, questions about how one can best understand the world."&lt;ref name=Dimitriadis2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dimitriadis|first1=Greg|title=Framing Hip Hop: New Methodologies for New Times|journal=Urban Education|date=2015|volume=50|issue=1|pages=31–51|doi=10.1177/0042085914563185}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hip hop studies, this "world" encompasses the complexities of political, social, and economic exploitation of marginalized peoples, and hip hop practitioners'  resultant forms of resistant expression,&lt;ref name=Rose1994 /&gt; thus the frames of analysis used by scholars are equally complex and consider factors such as race, class, gender, gender identity, sexuality, location, and performance and performativity.&lt;ref name=Dimitriadis2015 /&gt; The use of [[ethnography]] is popular and preferred in hip hop studies because it is a mode of inquiry that enables a scholar to include a multiplicity of voices, and showcases the experiential knowledges of hip hop doers and consumers; ideally this method highlights the dual authority of practitioners' and academics' knowledges.&lt;ref name=Dimitriadis2015 /&gt;

== Foundational texts ==
Hip Hop studies has been growing as an academic discipline since the mid-1990s; two decades after its genesis. By the millennium and in the early 2000s, scholars such as [[Tricia Rose]], [[Michael Eric Dyson]], [[Cornel West]], [[Anthony B. Pinn]], [[Jeff Chang (journalist)|Jeff Chang]], [[Nelson George]], Bakari Kitwana, [[Mark Anthony Neal]], and Murray Forman, began engage Hip Hop's history, messages of resistance, social cognizance, personal awareness, political activism, pleasure and power, and community engagement in scholarly works that gave Hip Hop academic legitimacy.&lt;ref name=JHHS2014 /&gt;  Works by these authors are considered foundational texts in the field of Hip Hop studies because their research and publication served to legitimate Hip Hop as serious academic endeavor and since 2002 scholarly inquiry centralizing Hip Hop culture has multiple exponentially; exemplified by the inception of the [http://hiphoparchive.org Hip Hop Archive &amp; Research Institute at Harvard] in 2002,&lt;ref name=HHArchive@Harvard&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drake|first1=DJ Bobby|title=Hip Hop Archive &amp; Research Institute|url=http://hiphoparchive.org|website=Hip Hop Archive|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the publication of the second edition of ''That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader'' in 2011.&lt;ref name=TTJ2011&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Forman|editor1-first=Murray|editor2-last=Neal|editor2-first=Marc Anthony|title=That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tricia Rose's ''Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America '' (1994) ===
Discussions of scholarly writing on hip hop in the academia often begin with Tricia Rose's ''Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America'', published in 1994. This book is categorized within hip hop studies as being among the most important early full-length texts on rap and hip hop culture, which helped to establish hip hop studies as a legitimate field of scholarly inquiry.&lt;ref name=Woldu2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woldu|first1=Gail Hilson|title=The Kaleidoscope of Writing on Hip-Hop Culture|journal=Notes|date=1 September 2010|volume=67|issue=1|pages=9–38|doi=10.1353/not.2010.0031}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rose's book gives a comprehensive account of the evolutionary history of hip hop culture. In Rose's words, ''Black Noise'' "examines the complex and contradictory relationships between forces of racial and sexual domination, black cultural priorities, and popular resistance in contemporary rap music,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Tricia|title=Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America|date=1994|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Introduction|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it outlines the social context of rap's existence. To achieve this analysis, Rose's includes a range of voices and perspectives by using an ethnographic approach; conducting interviews with hip hop performers and practitioners, as well as hip hop listeners and consumers.&lt;ref name=Rose1994&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Tricia|title=Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America|date=1994|publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose's interviews were conducted throughout the United States, as well as in Hong Kong, China, and Japan.&lt;ref name=Rose1994 /&gt; Rose's groundbreaking work continues to be referenced as a foundational text by contemporary scholars because its detailed documentation of hip hop culture's revolution employs [[ethnography]], cultural theory, urban history and historiography, as well as [[Black feminism|black feminist thought]]; culminating in an extensive bibliography.&lt;ref name=Woldu2010 /&gt;

=== Jeff Chang's ''Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation'' (2005) ===
Jeff Chang's comprehensive examination of hip hop, ''Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation'', received the American Book Award after its publication in 2005 and is often cited by hip hop cultural critics, hip hop journalists, popular-culture scholars, and hip hop academics.&lt;ref name=Chang2005&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Jeff|title=Can't Stop Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation|date=2005|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-42579-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang situates hip hop as "forged in the fires of the Bronx and Kingston, Jamaica,"&lt;ref name=Chang2005BACK&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Jeff|title=Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation|date=2005|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-42579-1|page=Rear Cover Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that "hip-hop has been a generation-defining global movement," &lt;ref name=Chang2005BACK /&gt; shaped by the deindustrialization and globalization of the post-civil rights era.&lt;ref name=Chang2005 /&gt; Chang's method of inquiry and analysis hybrids statistical, historical, and ehtnographical data with a casual writing style that includes Chang's opinions, sections of extended dialogue, and interviews.&lt;ref name=Chang2005 /&gt; Chang's central themes in this text are race, and the intersections of race in hip hop agendas/politics.&lt;ref name=Chang2005 /&gt;

== College/university programs and degrees ==

[[Howard University]], a [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black college]], was the first to offer a Hip Hop-specific class to students in 1991.&lt;ref name="ACADEMICYES2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/ACADEMIC-HIP-HOP-YES-YES-Y-ALL-2613595.php|title=ACADEMIC HIP-HOP? YES, YES Y'ALL.|last1=Harmanci|first1=Reyham|date=2007|website=SF Gate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the proceeding two decades, colleges across the United States have begun to offer a variety of courses specifically about Hip Hop culture; these include top-ranked universities, such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Rice University|Rice]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[New York University|NYU]].&lt;ref name=JHHS2014 /&gt; Additionally, in 2012, the [[University of Arizona]] announced the implementation of a Hip Hop studies minor; the first of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wasserman|first1=Bonnie|title=Announcing a New Minor in Africana Studies with Concentration in Hip-Hop Cultures at the U of A!|url=http://africana.arizona.edu/news-events/announcing-new-minor-africana-studies-concentration-hip-hop-cultures-u|website=The University of Arizona: College of Humanities Africana Studies|accessdate=5 March 2015|date=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the University of Arizona's minor is the first interdisciplinary Hip Hop studies concentration of its kind, since 2009 at [[McNally Smith College of Music]] in St. Paul, Minnesota students can acquire a diploma in Hip Hop studies that focuses on Hip Hop music technique, music and audio production, and music industry economics and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diploma: Hip-Hop Studies|url=http://www.mcnallysmith.edu/diplomas/hip-hop-studies|website=McNally Smith College of Music|accessdate=5 March 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013 [[Tiffin University]] in Ohio began offering a music performance degree for students with primary focus in emceeing and beatmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://polarentllc.com/producer-j-rawls-joins-tiffin-university-team/|title=Producer J Rawls Joins Tiffin University Team  Polar Ent LLC|website=polarentllc.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tiffin.edu/promusic|title=Professional Music|last=University|first=Tiffin|website=Tiffin University|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from classes and degree programs, development in the field has also been marked by the proliferation of conferences (domestically and internationally), symposiums, the development of readers and anthological texts, the establishment of the Hip Hop Archive and Research Institute at Harvard—each characteristic of a growing interest in and engagement with Hip Hop culture in academic discourse. In 2017, the top three universities to study Hip Hop at were [[McNally Smith College of Music]], [[North Carolina Central University]], and [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.campustales.com/281/top-3-universities-to-study-hip-hop-music|title=Top 3 Universities to Study Hip Hop Music|work=CampusTales|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques and critics ==

Hip Hop studies has not grown without critics, both within and outside the field. Davey D. (also known as: David Cook), a Bronx native and Hip Hop journalist, historian, adjunct professor, and community activist, has written and verbalized critiques of academic Hip Hop claiming that the narrow standards that define legitimate scholarly inquiry exclude individuals who do Hip Hop, in favor of published academics who may or may not have any lived or tangible connection to Hip Hop culture at all.&lt;ref name=ACADEMICYES2007 /&gt; In an article published by the ''San Francisco Globe'' in March 2007, Davey D. is quoted as saying: "You have an interesting phenomenon, where the 'hip-hop experts,' with university appointments attached to their name, have no credibility whatsoever in hip-hop circles. That, coupled with the fact that academia in a lot of places has always kept a distinct separation between what goes on in community and what happens on campus, is a source of tension."&lt;ref name=ACADEMICYES2007 /&gt; 
Hip hop's complex foundations have fostered a divergence of opinion amongst scholars regarding how writing on hip hop culture should be done.&lt;ref name=Woldu2010 /&gt; Namely, this debate is centralized around questions of language, and for what audience(s) scholars should be writing to address: the academic and/or scholar, the dilettante, or the fan and/or self-self-proccalimed "hip hop head."&lt;ref name=Woldu2010 /&gt; Since approximately 1988, three categories of writing on hip hop culture have emerged: works by academics, works by journalists and cultural critics, and works by hip-hop devotees; critiques of hip hop studies include questions of which kind of writing is considered authentic or legitimate within the field, and the accessibility that outsiders, or non-academics, would have to those texts, both physically and comprehensively.&lt;ref name=Woldu2010 /&gt;
Other critics, such as [[Alex Beam]] a columnist for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', have claimed that the study of Hip Hop is unsuitable for critical academic study, citing the "celebration of ignorance, gangster-ism...and violence against women,"&lt;ref name=alexbeam&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beam|first1=Alex|title=Meet the rap-ademics|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2010/12/14/the_ivy_league_offers_its_esteemed_interpretation_of_hip_hop_lyrics/?p1=Features_link11|accessdate=5 March 2015|agency=Boston Globe|publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC|date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in mainstream rap and Hip Hop.&lt;ref name=alexbeam /&gt;

Despite the critiques previously mentioned, not all critics of Hip Hop studies are trying to point out the perceived flaws as ways to invalidate its place in academia. Hip Hop feminists and feminism offer critics of Hip Hop studies from a perspective which adds another facet to Hip Hop studies, one that not only involves but gives a platform and amplifies the voice of Black and Latinx women and the LGBTQ+ community as they face the most erasure in the world of Hip Hop studies, even though they were there from the very start. Published books such as ''Home Girls Make Some Noise: Hip Hop Feminism Anthology''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/123957643|title=Home girls make some noise : hip-hop feminism anthology|date=2007|publisher=Parker Publishing, LLC|others=Pough, Gwendolyn D., 1970-, Neal, Mark Anthony., Morgan, Joan.|isbn=1600430104|edition=First|location=Mira Loma, Calif.|oclc=123957643}}&lt;/ref&gt;'', is'' an anthology that features journals, poetry, and articles by both women of color and LGBTQ+ community which depict where Hip Hop began and the direction in which it very well may go.

'''Industrial arts''' is an educational program which features fabrication of objects in wood or metal using a variety of hand, power, or machine tools. It may include [[small engine repair]] and [[automobile maintenance]], and all programs usually cover [[technical drawing]] as part of the curricula. As an educational term, ''industrial arts'' dates from 1904 when Charles R. Richards of Teachers College, Columbia University, New York suggested it to replace ''[[manual training]]''.

In the [[U.S.A.|United States]], industrial arts classes are colloquially known as "'''[[Workshop |shop]] class'''"; these programs expose children to the basics of home repair, manual craftsmanship, and machine safety. Most industrial arts programs were established in comprehensive rather than dedicated [[vocational schools]] and focused on a broad range of skills rather than on a specific [[vocational training]]. In 1980, the name of industrial arts education in New York State was changed to "[[technology education]]" during what was called the "Figuring Project". The project goal was to increase students' [[technological literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.oswego.edu/technology/history-1/ |title= History {{!}} Department of Technology |last=|first= |date= 2017 |website= www.oswego.edu |at=sec. Technology Education |language= en |archive-url=|archive-date= |dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (VIC, Australia) industrial arts is still a key part of the high school curriculum. The term now describes a key study of [[technology]] that focuses on both engineering and industrial technologies. Additionally, [[design]] using the aforementioned technologies is now a key part of the industrial arts curriculum and has been since the mid-1980s when the subject of technics was introduced into Victorian high schools.

One of the most important aspects of industrial arts is still that while students design they ultimately realize a solution; learning the challenges involved with working with materials and also the challenges of small scale project management.

Some universities have doctoral programs in industrial arts.

==Industrial arts clubs==
An industrial arts club is an organization that promotes the use of industrial fabrication equipment by the general public. Clubs have grown out of the decline of industrial arts (aka shop class) programs in comprehensive school systems in the US.
Clubs began as student organizations in primary and secondary schools offering industrial, the [[TechShop]] and Sparqs Industrial Arts Club based in Massachusetts which grew out of campus activities at [[MIT]].

==Industrial Arts in New South Wales==
Industrial Arts (IA) is an important part of the (NSW) high school curriculum. Industrial Arts syllabi are managed, like all NSW syllabi by the [[Board of Studies]]. In some schools Industrial Arts faculties have become part of a larger Technology faculty, however many schools still have a stand-alone Industrial Arts faculty.

The primary role of Industrial Arts education is to expose students to a variety of industrial and [[engineering]] technologies that improve their understanding of the industrial and engineered world. Moreover, students learn both project management and design principles, most courses are project based with students realizing a solution to a design or engineering challenge. Two key components of the projects are '''synthesis''' of a solution and '''evaluation''' of the final product. Both of these components are the highest order objectives in [[Bloom's Taxonomy]].

===Industrial Arts Curricula in NSW===
Industrial Arts has a single compulsory course for Years 7 and 8: Technology (Mandatory). This course also has area that cover Home Economics concepts and Information Communication Technologies (ICT) content.

For Years 9 and 10 all Industrial Arts courses are electives, the three electives on offer are Design and Technology, Graphics Technology and Industrial Technology. The most popular Industrial Arts elective is Industrial Technology.

*'''Design and Technology''': this course centres on design without a prescribed context, so students may work with a variety of non-specified technologies. Students are given a design challenge and they come up with a solution. Their passage through the design process is documented in a Design Folio. In some schools Design and Technology may not be delivered by the Industrial Arts faculty, in some schools the [[Home Economics]] faculty may run the Design and Technology course.
*'''Graphics Technology''': this course introduces students to both manual (pencil) technical drawing and [[Computer Aided Design]] (CAD). This course has a core study in Year 9 and then a variety of electives for Year 10 including: Engineering Drawing, Architectural Drawing and Computer Animation.
*'''Industrial Technology''': this course may be studied with a variety of different disciplines with the most popular ones being: [[timber]], [[metal]], [[electronics]], [[multimedia]] and [[engineering]]. All have a common theme that students are involved in designing and making projects relevant to the context being studied. For example, a student in Industrial Technology – Multimedia may be asked to design an animation or website advertising a product. The development of their project is documented in their Project Report. A key part of the project report is evaluation of the finished product.

In Years 11 and 12 Industrial Arts offers three [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]] (HSC) non-Vocational courses: Design and Technology, Engineering Studies and Industrial Technology.
*'''Design and Technology''' is an extension of the junior course of the same name. The course centres on design without a prescribed context, so students may work with a variety of non-specified technologies. For their HSC students must create a Major Design Project. Students establish a need and then try to solve it and realise a solution. A key part of the project is evaluation through the design process. The Major Design project counts for 60% of their final HSC examination mark.
*'''Engineering Studies''' is primarily a theory course that introduces students to the engineered world. The course looks at a variety of engineering applications and fields of engineering. Students learn about engineering history and societal implications, [[engineering mechanics]], [[engineering materials]], engineering electronics and engineering communication methods. The course introduces students to many concepts that they would otherwise first encounter in undergraduate engineering programmes at university.  One of the fundamental aspects of the course is learning engineering through the investigation of real life applications. This builds greater significance and understanding in students.
*'''Industrial Technology''' is also an extension of the junior course of the same name. The course centres on students working within a prescribed technology such as: Timber Products and Furniture Industries, Multimedia Industries Automotive Industries, Electronics Industries, Graphics Industries and Metal and Engineering Industries. For their HSC students must create a Major Project. Students develop a project and document their progress through the project. Hence they learn the vital skills of project management. Similar to Design and Technology evaluation of the project is an important part of the associated documentation.  The Major Project counts for 60% of their final HSC examination mark. The fundamental difference between Industrial Technology and Design and Technology is that a student studying Industrial Technology must study theory relevant to specific technology and also study industry practices relevant to their technology.

==Professional Association for Industrial Arts in New South Wales==
In NSW the professional association for Industrial Arts teachers is the [[Institute of Industrial Arts Technology Education]] ([[IIATE]]). This organisation releases a quarterly journal (on CD) and also runs an annual conference that investigates matters relevant to Industrial Arts education. Moreover, the IIATE represents Industrial Arts teachers in a variety of situations such as syllabus development meetings and teacher training interviews.

Another important role that The IIATE fulfils is that of Professional Learning. The IIATE has run some very successful training days called ''Hands on Technology'' where teachers are able to build their skills and knowledge in a variety of areas. This ''Hands on'' concept has now been extended with the ''Hands on Engineering'' day now being developed to assist teachers in delivering the Industrial Arts' courses Industrial Technology - Engineering and Engineering Studies.

The IIATE has also successfully run training programmes for CAD software which has enable many more teachers to effectively embed CAD into their teaching.

'''Landscape planning''' is a branch of [[landscape architecture]]. According to Erv Zube (1931–2002) landscape planning is defined as an activity concerned with developing landscaping amongst competing [[land use]]s while protecting natural processes and significant cultural and [[natural resources]]. [[park system|Park systems]] and [[greenway (landscape)|greenways]] of the type designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] are key examples of landscape planning. Landscape designers tend to work for clients who wish to commission construction work. Landscape planners analyze broad issues as well as project characteristics which constrain design projects.

Landscape planners may work on projects which are of broad geographical scope, concern many land uses or many clients or are implemented over a long period of time. As an example, the damage caused by unplanned [[mineral extraction]] was one of the early reasons for a public demand for landscape planning.

==In Asia==
In India, the history of landscape planning can be traced to the [[Vedas]] and to the [[Vaastu Shastra]]s. These ancient texts set forth principles for planning settlements, temples and other structures in relation to the [[natural landscape]]. Relationships with mountains (the home of the gods) and with rivers (regarded as goddesses) were of particular importance. A square form represented the earth and a circular form represented heaven. A [[mandala]] explained the relationship between heaven and earth. Square plans, for both secular and religious structures, were set out with their sides facing north, south, east and west. The earliest surviving stone temple set out in this way is [[Sanchi]].

In China, landscape planning originated with [[Feng Shui]], which is translated into English as 'wind and water' and is used to describe a set of general principles for the planning of development in relation to the [[natural landscape]]. The aim was to find the most auspicious environment possible, one sited in harmony with natural phenomena and the physical and psychological needs of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chinese Architecture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2T1mScdj8CYC|publisher = Yale University Press|date = 2002-01-01|isbn = 0300095597|language = en|first = Nancy Shatzman|last = Steinhardt|first2 = Xinian|last2 = Fu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Europe==
In [[Europe]], the history of landscape planning can be traced to the work of [[Vitruvius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vitruvius Ten Books on Architecture, with regard to landscape and garden design|url = http://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/garden_landscape_design_articles/landscape_theory/vitruvius|website = www.gardenvisit.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing the planning of towns, he wrote about site planning with regard to microclimate, about the planning of streets and about the role of metaphor in design. Vitruvius' theories were revived during the renaissance and came to influence the planning of towns throughout Europe and the Americas. [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] wrote on the need for town squares for markets and specific implementations to make most use of the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Public and Private Spaces of the City|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=thmCAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2003-09-02|isbn = 1134519850|language = en|first = Ali|last = Madanipour}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North Europe this developed into the idea that residential squares should planned around green spaces. The first space of this type was the [[Place des Vosges]]. Residential squares were also made in Britain and their planning developed into the idea of incorporating public open space ([[public park]]s within towns). [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] gave momentum to this idea with his proposal for a [[park system]]s in Boston - the famous [[Emerald Necklace]]. [[Patrick Abercrombie]] took up this idea and incorporated it in his great 1943-4 Open Space Plan for the County of London.

==In the US ==
In the United States, landscape architects provide landscape planning services focused on the natural environment along with [[urban planner|urban planners]]. But, unlike Canada and Europe, the US does not have a national [[land use planning]] system. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Ian McHarg]] are two influential American landscape architects that also worked as planners. McHarg's work on overlay landscape planning contributed to the development of [[GIS]] and to the foundation of [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] by [[Jack Dangermond]].

==Legislation==
The principles of landscape planning are now incorporated in various types of legislation and policy documents. In America, the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] was influenced by the work of [[Ian McHarg]] on [[Environmental impact assessment]]. In Germany, the Federal Nature Conservation Act requires the preparation of landscape plans. For the Europe Union as a whole, the [[European Landscape Convention]] has wide-ranging implications for the design and planning of relationships between development and the landscape. In Asia, major development projects are taking place and illustrating the need for good landscape planning. The [[Three Gorges Dam]], for example, will have extensive impacts on the landscape. They have been planned to a degree but future monitoring of the project is likely to show that better landscape planning and design would have been possible.

==Theory==
{{Disputed-section|The Broads|date=December 2012}}
Landscape planners are concerned with the 'health' of the landscape, just as doctors are concerned with bodily health. This analogy can be taken further. Medical doctors advise both on the health of individuals and on matters of public health. When individuals take actions injurious to their own health this is regarded as a private matter. But if they take actions injurious to public health, these actions are properly regulated by law. The [[collective landscape]] is a [[public good]] which should be protected and enhanced by legislation and public administration. If, for example, mineral extraction has a damaging impact on the landscape, this is a proper field for intervention. Negative impacts on the landscape could include visual impacts, ecological impacts, hydrological impacts and recreational impacts. As well as protecting existing public goods, societies are responsible for the creation of new public goods. This can be done by positive landscape planning. There are, for example, many former mineral workings (e.g. the [[Norfolk Broads]]) which have become important public goods. Medical doctors are trained in [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]] etc. before becoming practitioners. Landscape doctors are trained in [[geomorphology]], [[hydrology]], [[ecology]] etc. before becoming practitioners in design and planning. When qualified, they can specialize in areas of landscape planning:
*[[Landscape of roads]] - The landscape treatment of roads is concerned with the planning and design of [[road]]s and [[highway]]s with regard to their [[environmental impact assessment|environmental impact]] on the surrounding landscape. Sylvia Crowe wrote a pioneering book on the design of roads with regard to their impact on the landscape and Ian McHarg proposed an overlay system for highway route selection in his book on ''Design with nature''. In addition, the role of landscape, natural and ecological features and values especially natural and man-made infrastructure networks is hence quite important when planning strategic and macro policies, given that urban and inter-urban access networks are amongst the most important infrastructures in regional national and international levels. From the landscape point of view, ''general highway landscape frameworks'' must be formulated with respect to environmental needs ecological conditions and visual attractions, and particularly road edges. This can underlie quality-oriented planning and landscape design in many highways in regional and national levels.&lt;ref name=Taghvaei&gt;Taghvaei, S-Hassan "Importance of Highway and Expressway Landscape Design." ''Journal of The Urban Development and Organization: Haft Shahr'', '''4''', No. 55-56. Autumn, 2016. 10–30. [www.haftshahrjournal.ir/article_26567_aedaa43a6bea0c726a9f973112885ee1.pdf. Accessed 10 February 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Landscape of forestry]] - The '''landscape treatment of forests''' is concerned with the non-timber objectives which can be obtained by conserving and developing forests: scenic quality, water quality, recreation, [[wildlife management|wildlife conservation]] and other [[environmental good]]s. This work is done by foresters who also hold qualifications in [[landscape architecture]] and also by landscape architects and landscape planners with a specialization in forestry. The [[United States Forest Service]], the [[Forestry Commission|UK Forestry Commission]] and other forest agencies are also employers of landscape architects. They have mitigated criticism of [[plantation|plantation forestry]], [[monoculture]], and [[clear-cutting]].
*[[Landscape of energy]] - The generation of energy has become a major land use with consequent [[Environmental Impact Assessment|environmental impacts]] upon the landscape. Landscape planning for energy is concerned with designs and plans to mitigate the impact of power generation upon the landscape. This includes landscape planning for:
** [[power stations]]
** [[Power transmission|power transmission lines]]
** [[hydroelectric power]]
** [[tidal power]]
** [[solar power]]
** [[wind power]]
*[[Landscape of urbanization]] - Most of the world's cities are expanding into agricultural land. Landscape planning for [[urbanization]] is concerned with the conservation and development of landscape resources as urbanization takes place. [[Ian McHarg|Ian McHarg's]] approach to this problem was to prepare a series of overlay maps showing the different types of quality in the land around settlements: agricultural value, property value, hydrological value, scenic value, recreational value, ecological value etc. The maps of value were then overlaid to produce a composite map which looked like an X-Ray photograph - with the dark areas having the most value and the white areas the least value. His belief was that the 'white land' should be urbanized in preference to the 'black land'. The overlay mapping system which McHarg proposed is now carried out using a [[Geographic Information System]]. Other landscape planners have proposed [[Greenway (landscape)|greenways]] and [[green belt]]s as a means of [[Growth management|urban growth management]].
*[[Landscape Urbanism]] is a theory of [[urbanism]] arguing that [[landscape]], rather than [[architecture]], is more capable of organizing the city and enhancing the urban experience.
*[[Landscape of recreation]] - Recreation has become a large-scale landuse. In the coastal regions of many countries (e.g. [[Spain]] and [[Denmark]]) it is the dominant land use and has had an enormous impact on the natural landscape. The landscape of [[recreation]] is concerned with mitigating the [[Environmental Impact Assessment|environmental impact]] of recreation on the landscape. [[Landscape architects]] and landscape planners work on the landscape of recreation to:
** reclaim landscapes which have been damaged by recreational use
** carry out [[Environmental Impact Assessment|environmental impact assessments]] of [[recreation resource planning|recreational development proposals]]
** prepare landscape plans and designs for recreation projects
*[[Landscape of mineral extraction]] - Mineral extraction has a long history of damaging the landscape. Harm has been caused to scenic quality, water quality, habitat quality and other [[environmental good]]s. The landscape treatment of mineral workings is concerned with:
** the [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of abandoned [[mining|mines]] and [[quarry|quarries]]
** the planning and design of future mineral workings to minimize their harmful [[environmental impact analysis|environmental impact]] and achieve as many positive impacts on the environment as possible.
*[[Landscape of agriculture]] - The primary purpose of agriculture is food production but concern for other objectives (e.g. wildlife, conservation, biodiversity, recreation and scenery) have a long history and are of increasing importance in wealthy and urbanized countries. The European Union Set-Aside Policy was designed as a means of giving money to farmers to produce non-food environmental goods from farmland. Landscape planners are involved with the preparation of agricultural landscape plans for the achievement of non-food objectives from agricultural land.
*[[River reclamation|Landscape of rivers]] - The construction of new buildings and new roads accelerates the discharge of surface water runoff and raises flood peaks in the lower reachers of river catchments. River banks therefore have to be raised and flood channels have to be constructed. The adoption of [[sustainable urban drainage systems]] facilitates the [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of rivers. When water is detained, infiltrated and transpired near to the where it falls, flood peaks are lowered and rivers can be reclaimed. The high concrete walls in which they were confined can be replaced by vegetated embankments. Water quality is improved and wildlife returns to the river. Projects to achieve these objectives are described as River Reclamation or River Restoration.
[[Image:khajuraho-landscape.jpg|thumb|right|The western group of [[Khajuraho]] temples (2005) set in an archaeologically inappropriate parkland landscape |300px]]
*[[Landscape of archaeology]] - The landscape of archaeology is concerned with the landscape treatment of archaeological sites. This involves analysis, discussion, the formulation of policies and the preparation of landscape designs relating a number of issues. In Britain the former Ministry of Public Works and Buildings (MPBW) (now [[English Heritage]], [[Cadw]], [[Historic Scotland]] and [[Environment and Heritage Service|Northern Ireland Environment and Heritage Service]]) had a policy of treating archaeological sites like highly manicured gardens. The grass was maintained almost to the quality of a bowling green. The standard of care was admirable but there was little or no regard to the former landscape character of the archaeological site. The development of the discipline of [[landscape archaeology]] has awakened interest in this question because the wider landscape is seen, correctly, as having archaeological value. Most historic societies earned their livelihood from working the land. Their buildings were an important accessory to the use of the land. In countries where the looting of archaeological sites is a problem, there is a tendency for them to be surrounded with chain links or other security fencing. This detracts from the relationship between the site and its landscape setting. In other countries, archaeological sites have become important visitor attractions and sources of revenue. This has led to the building of tourist facilities (visitor centres, hotels etc.) which can easily have a detrimental impact on the archaeological site and its landscape setting.

In each case, the aim is to take a specialist land use and make recommendations for what can be done to enhance its implact on the stock of [[environmental good]]s.

==Methodology==
The conventional planning process is a linear progression of activities. The common steps are:

*Identification of problems and opportunities.
*Establishment of goals.
*Inventory and analysis of the biophysical environment.
*Human community inventory and analysis.
*Development of concepts and the selection of options.
*Adoption of a plan.
*Community involvement and education.
*Detailed design.
*Plan implementation.
*Plan administration.

Landscape planning not always means an ecological planning method, for that it must be considered that "planning is a process that uses the scientific and technical information for considering and reaching consensus on a range of choices. Ecology is the study of the relationship of all living things, including people, to their biological and physical environments. Ecological planning then may be defined as the use of biophysical and sociocultural information to suggest opportunities and constraints for decision making about the use of landscape". (Steiner, 1991)

The '''MPT8080 "Microtutor"''' is a [[microprocessor]] trainer based on the [[Intel 8080]] processor, developed by Limrose Electronics. It was designed in the mid-1970s to assist in the understanding of the then-new microprocessors.

Users of the MPT8080 enter [[assembly language]] programs via binary switches or a [[hexadecimal]] keypad. While the code executes, the user can observe what is happening on the address, data, and control signals of the microprocessor. The MPT8080 acts like a [[Computer architecture simulator|simulator]], in that code can be stepped through one [[Instruction set|instruction]]—or each cycle of each individual instruction—at a time to observe what is happening.

The MPT8080 has simple input and output, consisting of eight [[LED]]s and eight switches. The input port allows code to sense the state of external switches, whilst the output port can display information on one of its eight LEDs. The input and outputs port also have connectors, allowing them to be connected to external signals through accessory patch kits, allowing the MPT8080 to control and monitor other circuitry.

==History==
Initially, a [[Motorola 6800]]-based trainer was developed alongside the Intel 8080–based model, but due to technical and operational issues the 6800 trainer was abandoned.

As recently as 2012, the MPT8080 remained in academic use at [[King's College London]], as part of a course in practical physics.

=== MPT8080 Version 1 ===
The initial version of the MPT8080 was designed by Dr. Ravi Raizada, the chief executive officer of Limrose Electronics.  It was first marketed in 1977.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version used eight binary switches and a load button for program entry.

=== MPT8080 Version 2 ===
The second version of the MPT8080, introduced around 1980,{{When|date=March 2011}} replaced the binary switch input with a 16-key hexadecimal keypad.  Although more than half of the trainer's circuitry was redesigned for this version, it remained compatible with the first version. A trace mode was added to allow single-cycle execution as well as machine cycles; this allowed the user to quickly step through code until reaching the portion of the program in which the user was interested.

== Operating the MPT8080 ==
Programs are entered in the MPT8080 in data entry mode ("MMLE").  Each byte of the program is entered, either by toggling the binary switches and pressing the load button, or by entering the byte on the hexadecimal keypad.  The program can then be executed.

The program can control the eight output port lines, turning the associated LEDs on or off.

By selecting single-step and single-cycle mode and stepping through a program with the step button, the user can see exactly what happens during every [[instruction cycle]], observing the program counter, data bus and control signals on their corresponding LEDs.

By selecting single-instruction mode, rather than single-cycle mode, each press of the step button will execute a complete instruction, rather than a single cycle.  This is useful for quickly advancing to a specific address.

The input/output ports can be used to read external signals and drive [[output device]]s like motors and buzzers with little or no additional hardware.

The system is programmed directly in 8080 [[machine code]]:
&lt;pre&gt;
Address       Code           Instruction                     Comments
0000          DB 00          IN  0                           Read from switches
0002          D3 00          OUT 0                           write to LEDs
0004          C3 00 00       JMP 0                           return to start of code
&lt;/pre&gt;

A '''manuscript''' (abbreviated '''MS''' for singular and '''MSS''' for plural) was, traditionally, any document that is written by hand -- or, once practical [[typewriter]]s became available, [[typewritten]] -- as opposed to being mechanically [[printing|printed]] or reproduced in some indirect or automated way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manuscript|title=Definition of MANUSCRIPT|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the term has come to be understood to further include ''any'' written, typed, or word-processed copy of an author's work, as distinguished from its rendition as a printed version of the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the arrival of [[printing]], all documents and books were manuscripts. Manuscripts are not defined by their contents, which may combine writing with mathematical calculations, maps, explanatory figures or illustrations. Manuscripts may be in book form, [[scroll (parchment)|scrolls]] or in [[codex]] format. [[Illuminated manuscript]]s are enriched with pictures, border decorations, elaborately embossed initial letters or full-page illustrations.

Before the invention of [[woodblock printing]] in China or by [[moveable type]] in a [[printing press]] in Europe, all written documents had to be both produced and reproduced by hand. Historically, manuscripts were produced in form of scrolls (''volumen'' in Latin) or books (''codex'', plural ''codices''). Manuscripts were produced on [[vellum]] and other parchment, on [[papyrus]], and on paper. In Russia [[birch bark document]]s as old as from the 11th century have survived. In India, the [[palm leaf manuscript]], with a distinctive long rectangular shape, was used from ancient times until the 19th century. [[Paper]] spread from China via the Islamic world to Europe by the 14th century, and by the late 15th century had largely replaced parchment for many purposes.

When Greek or Latin works were published, numerous professional copies were made simultaneously by scribes in a [[scriptorium]], each making a single copy from an original that was declaimed aloud.

The oldest written manuscripts have been preserved by the perfect dryness of their Middle Eastern resting places, whether placed within [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] in Egyptian tombs, or reused as [[mummy]]-wrappings, discarded in the [[midden]]s of [[Oxyrhynchus]] or secreted for safe-keeping in jars and buried ([[Nag Hammadi library]]) or stored in dry caves ([[Dead Sea scrolls]]). Manuscripts in [[Tocharian languages]], written on palm leaves, survived in desert burials in the [[Tarim Basin]] of Central Asia. Volcanic ash preserved some of the Roman library of the [[Villa of the Papyri]] in [[Herculaneum]].

Ironically, the manuscripts that were being most carefully preserved in the libraries of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] are virtually all lost. Papyrus has a life of at most a century or two in relatively moist Italian or Greek conditions; only those works copied onto parchment, usually after the general conversion to Christianity, have survived, and by no means all of those.

Originally, all books were in manuscript form. In China, and later other parts of East Asia, [[woodblock printing]] was used for books from about the 7th century. The earliest dated example is the [[Diamond Sutra]] of 868. In the Islamic world and the West, all books were in manuscript until the introduction of movable type printing in about 1450. Manuscript copying of books continued for a least a century, as printing remained expensive. Private or government documents remained hand-written until the invention of the typewriter in the late 19th century. Because of the likelihood of errors being introduced each time a manuscript was copied, the [[Stemmatics|filiation]] of different versions of the same text is a fundamental part of the study and criticism of all texts that have been transmitted in manuscript.

In [[Southeast Asia]], in the first millennium, documents of sufficiently great importance were inscribed on soft metallic sheets such as [[intaglio printing|copperplate]], softened by refiner's fire and inscribed with a metal stylus. In the [[Philippines]], for example, as early as 900AD, specimen documents were not inscribed by stylus, but were punched much like the style of today's [[dot-matrix printer]]s. This type of document was rare compared to the usual leaves and bamboo staves that were inscribed. However, neither the leaves nor paper were as durable as the metal document in the hot, humid climate. In [[Myanmar|Burma]], the kammavaca, Buddhist manuscripts, were inscribed on brass, copper or ivory sheets, and even on discarded monk robes folded and lacquered. In [[Italy]] some important [[Etruria|Etruscan]] texts were similarly inscribed on thin gold plates: similar sheets have been discovered in [[Bulgaria]]. Technically, these are all inscriptions rather than manuscripts.

The study of the writing, or "hand" in surviving manuscripts is termed [[palaeography]]. In the Western world, from the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]] through the early centuries of the [[Christian era]], manuscripts were written without spaces between the words ([[scriptio continua]]), which makes them especially hard for the untrained to read. Extant copies of these early manuscripts written in [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Latin]] and usually dating from the 4th century to the 8th century, are classified according to their use of either all [[majuscule|upper case]] or all [[lower case|lower case letters]]. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] manuscripts, such as the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] make no such differentiation. Manuscripts using all upper case letters are called [[majuscule]], those using all lower case are called [[lower case|minuscule]]. Usually, the majuscule scripts such as [[uncial]] are written with much more care. The scribe lifted his pen between each stroke, producing an unmistakable effect of regularity and formality. On the other hand, while minuscule scripts can be written with pen-lift, they may also be [[cursive]], that is, use little or no pen-lift.

==Modern variations==
In the context of [[library science]], a manuscript is defined as any hand-written item in the collections of a library or an archive. For example, a library's collection of hand-written letters or diaries is considered a manuscript collection. Such manuscript collections are described in finding aids, similar to an index or table of contents to the collection, in accordance with national and international content standards such as [[Describing Archives: A Content Standard|DACS]] and [[ISAD(G)]].

In other contexts, however, the use of the term "manuscript" no longer necessarily means something that is hand-written. By analogy a ''typescript'' has been produced on a typewriter.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/typescript |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In book, magazine, and music publishing, a manuscript is an original copy of a work written by an author or composer, which generally follows standardized typographic and formatting rules. (The staff paper commonly used for handwritten music is, for this reason, often called "manuscript paper"). In film and theatre, a manuscript, or ''script'' for short, is an author's or dramatist's text, used by a theatre company or film crew during the production of the work's performance or filming. More specifically, a motion picture manuscript is called a screenplay; a television manuscript, a teleplay; a manuscript for the theatre, a stage play; and a manuscript for audio-only performance is often called a radio play, even when the recorded performance is disseminated via non-radio means.

In insurance, a manuscript policy is one that is negotiated between the insurer and the policyholder, as opposed to an off-the-shelf form supplied by the insurer.

==European manuscript history==

[[File:European Output of Manuscripts 500–1500.png|thumb|left|After plummeting in the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[High Middle Ages|high]] and [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval period]] witnessed a sharp increase of manuscript production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buringh|first1=Eltjo|last2=Van Zanden|first2=Jan Luiten|title=Charting the 'Rise of the West': Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries|journal=The Journal of Economic History|date=2009|volume=69|issue=2|pages=409–445|doi=10.1017/s0022050709000837}} (see p. 416, table 1)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Most surviving pre-modern manuscripts use the codex format (as in a modern book), which had replaced the scroll by [[Late Antiquity]]. [[Parchment]] or [[vellum]], as the best type of parchment is known, had also replaced [[papyrus]], which was not nearly so long lived and has survived to the present only in the extremely dry conditions of [[Egypt]], although it was widely used across the Roman world. Parchment is made of animal skin, normally calf, sheep, and/or goat, but also other animals. With all skins, the quality of the finished product is based on how much preparation and skill was put into turning the skin into parchment. Parchment made from calf or sheep was the most common in Northern Europe, while civilizations in Southern Europe preferred goatskin.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;Clemens, Raymond, and Timothy Graham.

Ithaca: [[Cornell University Press]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, if the parchment is white or cream in color and veins from the animal can still be seen, it is calfskin. If it is yellow, greasy or in some cases shiny, then it was made from sheepskin.&lt;ref name="Intro" /&gt;

Vellum comes from the [[Latin]] word vitulinum which means “of calf”/ “made from calf”. For modern parchment makers and calligraphers, and apparently often in the past, the terms parchment and vellum are used based on the different degrees of quality, preparation and thickness, and not according to which animal the skin came from, and because of this, the more neutral term "membrane" is often used by modern academics, especially where the animal has not been established by testing.&lt;ref name="Intro" /&gt;

Because they are books, pre-modern manuscripts are best described using bibliographic rather than archival standards. The standard endorsed by the American Library Association is known as AMREMM.&lt;ref name="AMREMM"&gt;Pass, Gregory. Descriptive Cataloging of Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, and Early Modern Manuscripts. Chicago: Association of College and Research Libraries, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A growing digital catalog of pre-modern manuscripts is [[Digital Scriptorium]], hosted by the University of California at Berkeley.

==A sample of common genres of manuscripts==
From ancient texts to medieval maps, anything written down for study would have been done with manuscripts. Some of the most common genres were bibles, religious commentaries, philosophy, law and government texts.

===Bibles===
“[[The Bible]] was the most studied book of the Middle Ages.”&lt;ref name="beryl"&gt;Beryl Smalley, The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages. 3rd ed. (Oxford, 1983), xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;
The Bible was the center of medieval religious life. Along with the Bible came scores of commentaries. Commentaries were written in volumes, with some focusing on just single pages of scripture. Across Europe, there were universities that prided themselves on their biblical knowledge. Along with universities, certain cities also had their own celebrities of biblical knowledge during the medieval period.

===Book of hours===
[[File:Pentecost 01.jpg|thumb|The Pentecost, from an illuminated Catholic [[liturgical]] manuscript, c.1310-1320]]
A [[book of hours]] is a type of devotional text which was widely popular during the Middle Ages. They are the most common type of surviving medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]]. Each book of hours contain a similar collection of texts, [[Christian prayer|prayers]], and [[Psalms (Christian)|psalms]] but decoration can vary between each and each example. Many have minimal illumination, often restricted to ornamented [[initials]], but books of hours made for wealthier patrons can be extremely extravagant with full-page [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]]. These books were used for owners to recite prayers privately eight different times, or hours, of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medievalbooksofhours.com/learn#basic|title=Book of Hours Tutorial|last=|first=|date=|website=Les Enluminures|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgical books and calendars===
Along with Bibles, large numbers of manuscripts made in the Middle Ages were revieved in Church{{clarification needed|reason=received? revived? reviewed?|date=August 2016}}. Due to the complex church system of rituals and worship these books were the most elegantly written and finely decorated of all medieval manuscripts. Liturgical books usually came in two varieties. Those used during mass and those for divine office.&lt;ref name="Intro" /&gt;

Most liturgical books came with a calendar in the front. This served as a quick reference point for important dates in Jesus' life and to tell church officials which saints were to be honored and on what day. The format of the liturgical calendar was as follows:

Almost all medieval calendars give each day's date according to the Roman method of reckoning time. In the Roman system, each month had three fixed points known as Kalends (Kal), the Nons and the Ides. The Nones fell on the fifth of the month in January, February, April, June, August, September, November and December, but on the seventh of the month in March, May, July and October. The Ides fell on the thirteenth in those months in which the Nones fell on the fifth, and the fifteenth in the other four months. All other days were dated by the number of days by which they preceded one of those fixed points.&lt;ref name="Intro" /&gt;&lt;!--pg.195--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.P. Pickering, The Calendar Pages of Medieval Service Books: An Introductory Note for Art Historians (Reading, UK., 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scripts==
[[File:Codex Manesse 193r - Albrecht von Rapperswil.jpg|thumb|Manuscript, [[Codex Manesse]] Most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baselines on which the text was entered.]]
[[Merovingian script]], or "Luxeuil minuscule", is named after an abbey in Western France, the [[Abbey of Luxeuil|Luxeuil Abbey]], founded by the Irish missionary St [[Columba]] ca. 590.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michelle P. ''Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts''. Toronto, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michelle P. ''A Guide to Western Historical Scripts from Antiquity to 1600''. Toronto,1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caroline minuscule]] is a [[Calligraphy|calligraphic script]] developed as a writing standard in [[Europe]] so that the [[Latin alphabet]] could be easily recognized by the literate class from different regions. It was used in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] between approximately 800 and 1200. Codices, classical and Christian texts, and educational material were written in Carolingian minuscule throughout the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The script developed into blackletter and became obsolete, though its revival in the Italian renaissance forms the basis of more recent scripts.&lt;ref name = "Intro" /&gt; In ''Introduction to Manuscript Studies'', Clemens and Graham associate the beginning of this text coming from the Abby of Saint-Martin at [[Tours]].&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;

Caroline Minuscule arrived in England in the second half of the 10th century. Its adoption there, replacing Insular script, was encouraged by the importation of continental European manuscripts by Saints Dunstan, Aethelwold, and Oswald. This script spread quite rapidly, being employed in many English centres for copying Latin texts. English scribes adapted the Carolingian script, giving it proportion and legibility. This new revision of the Caroline Minuscule was called English Protogothic Bookhand.
Another script that is derived from the Caroline Minuscule was the German Protogothic Bookhand. It originated in southern Germany during the second half of the 12th century.&lt;ref name="“script"&gt;Clemens, Raymond, and Timothy Graham. "English Protogothic Bookhand." In Introduction to Manuscript Studies. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2008. 146-147.&lt;/ref&gt;
All the individual letters are Caroline; but just as with English Protogothic Bookhand it evolved. This can be seen most notably in the arm of the letter h. It has a hairline that tapers out by curving to the left. When first read the German Protogothic h looks like the German Protogothic b.&lt;ref name="manu" &gt;Clemens, Raymond, and Timothy Graham. "German Protogothic Bookhand." In Introduction to Manuscript Studies. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2008. 149-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Many more scripts sprang out of the German Protogothic Bookhand. After those came Bastard Anglicana, which is best described as:
lipi = pandu lipi pura lipi vignayani
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The coexistence in the Gothic period of formal hands employed for the copying of books and cursive scripts used for documentary purposes eventually resulted in cross-fertilization between these two fundamentally different writing styles. Notably, scribes began to upgrade some of the cursive scripts. A script that has been thus formalized is known as a ''bastard'' script (whereas a bookhand that has had cursive elements fused onto it is known as a hybrid script). The advantage of such a script was that it could be written more quickly than a pure bookhand; it thus recommended itself to scribes in a period when demand for books was increasing and authors were tending to write longer texts. In England during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, many books were written in the script known as Bastard Anglicana.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;!--pg.164--&gt;

In neuroscience, the '''mass action principle''' suggests that the proportion of the brain that is injured is directly proportional to the decreased ability of memory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rutherford|first1=Raymond E. Fancher, Alexandra|title=Pioneers of psychology : a history|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=9780393935301|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, memory cannot be localized to a single cortical area, but is instead distributed throughout the cortex. This theory is contrasted by [[functional specialization (brain)|functional specialization]]. This is one of two principles that [[Karl Lashley]] published in 1950, alongside the [[equipotentiality]] principle.

==Early theories==

In the 19th century, animal researchers and scientists were divided into two main groups in terms of how they believe the brain compensated for induced brain damage. The redundancy theorists hypothesized that any lesioned section of cerebral mass had an almost duplicate section, usually on the opposing hemisphere. This "back-up" area was considered to be what takes over the functions of the lesioned area. On the other hand, vicariation theorists believed that different areas of the brain with different functions could assume responsibility for the affected area. Both ideas were highly debated and led to increased research on [[neuroplasticity]] and lesion research, eventually affecting the lesion research of [[Jean Pierre Flourens|Flourens]] and Lashley.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Contributors==

Localization theories can be dated as far back as Aristotle, but the man credited with the beginning concepts of field theory was [[Jean Pierre Flourens]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Field theory is the concept that the brain acts as a single functional unit.  He devised the first principle of mass action, stating,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"As long as not too much of the lobes is removed, they may in due time regain the exercise of their functions. Passing certain limits, however, the animal regains them only imperfectly, and passing these new limits it does not regain them at all. Finally, if one sensation comes back, all come back. If one faculty reappears, they all reappear.... This shows that each of these organs is only a single organ."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also developed the theory of [[equipotentiality]], stating, "All sensations, all perceptions, and all volition occupy concurrently the same seat in these organs. The faculty of sensation, perception, and volition is then essentially one faculty."&lt;ref name=tizard&gt;{{cite journal|last1=TIZARD|first1=B|title=Theories of brain localization from Flourens to Lashley.|journal=Medical History|date=April 1959|volume=3|issue=2|pages=132–45|pmid=13643147|doi=10.1017/s0025727300024418|pmc=1034464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Lashley]]'s most famous research was an attempt to find the parts of the brain that were responsible for learning and memory traces, a hypothetical structure he called the [[engram (neuropsychology)|engram]]. He trained rats to perform specific tasks (seeking a food reward), then lesioned varying portions of the rats' cortexes, either before or after the animals received the training depending upon the experiment. The amount of cortical tissue removed had specific effects on acquisition and retention of knowledge, but the location of the removed cortex had no effect on the rats' performance in the maze. This led Lashley to conclude that memories are not localized but widely distributed across the cortex.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Mass action principle versus functional specialization==
There is evidence supporting both the mass action principle and functional specialization within the brain. Functional specialization is the idea that functions are localized within the brain and can only be carried out by particular area(s) of the brain.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Some tasks appear to work on the mass action principle, with lesions causing less drastic effects than would be expected if the tasks were localized within the brain.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} This was shown in Lashley's rat maze experiments, in which the amount of tissue removed was more important to the rat's performance than where the tissue was removed from within the brain.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} There are, however, examples of highly specialized areas of the brain in which even small amounts of damage can cause dramatic effects on people's abilities to perform certain tasks. Two such areas effect the comprehension of speech and the ability to produce coherent speech, Wernicke's area and Broca's area, respectively.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Criticisms==
It is now believed that Flourens may have removed more than just the parts of the hemispheres that he claimed because his experiments can be replicated without his same drastic results.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} At the time, extraction methods were very crude and little was understood about the stages of recovery. These things contributed to the increased likelihood of symptoms occurring right after extraction to be attributed directly to the site of the lesion.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
Flourens' doctrine was widely accepted even though there were anatomists and physiologists disproving his ideas:

* [[Thomas Willis]] showed that there are nerves that connect the heart, lungs, and stomach to the cerebellum.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* [[François Pourfour du Petit]] demonstrated that localization of motor movements on one side of the body was contained in the hemisphere on the opposite side. In the 1860s, [[Hughlings Jackson]] also came to these conclusions after connecting convulsions on one side of the body to the disease of the opposite side of the brain{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* [[Alexander Bain]] explained the nervous system as a sort of interconnected system with the brain that transmits impulses{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* New experiments on [[electrical excitability]] in 1870 from [[Gustav Theodor Fritsch]], [[Eduard Hitzig]], and [[David Ferrier]] contributed to new findings regarding localization of function. And although their methods were still producing results that are considered off the mark today, they were important in building a foundation of support for a localization theory{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* Then Lashley came along with his publication of ''Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence'' in 1929. His findings were under the umbrella of field theory, but he didn't completely agree with Flourens. He determined that only the more elementary functions are localized, with the more complex ones not being bound to certain structures. [[Shepherd Ivory Franz]] contributed to this field greatly by using better methods to study live animals. Lashley used these methods in combination with a large sample of animals to get results that can be statistically analyzed, and therefore came up with his equipotentiality and mass action theories. However, many others came up with different conclusions based on his results that again cast doubt upon Lashley's determinations of what was observed.&lt;ref name=tizard/&gt;

==Conclusion==
Currently mass action principle is accepted as a mechanism for some functions within the brain. However, there have been some functions that are believed to be contained within specific areas of the brain (many related to speech, which was impossible to determine when the mass action principle was theorized, as experiments historically only used animals). It does not appear that this difference is determined by difficulty of the function, as some highly specialized tasks are localized.

The '''Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Max-Planck-Institut für Menschheitsgeschichte'') performs basic research into [[archaeogenetics]] and [[Evolutionary linguistics|linguistic cultural evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shh.mpg.de/en|title=Institute Profile|publisher=MPI-SHH|accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is one of 80+ research institutes of the [[Max Planck Society]] and is located in [[Jena]], [[Germany]].

The co-directors of the institute are:
* [[Nicole Boivin]] (Department of Archaeology)&lt;ref&gt; see [https://www.shh.mpg.de/archaeology Homepage of the departement of archaeology] &lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Russell Gray]] (Department of Linguistic and Cultural Evolution)
* [[Johannes Krause]] (Department of Archeogenetics)

== History == 
=== Max Planck Institute of Economics ===
The predecessor of the present institute was founded in 1993 as the [[Max Planck Institute for Research into Economic Systems]] (''Max-Planck-Institut zur Erforschung von Wirtschaftssystemen'') and later renamed the [[Max Planck Institute of Economics]] (''Max-Planck-Institut für Ökonomik''). Its initial mission was researching the transition of the former [[Eastern Europe|Eastern European]] [[socialism|socialist]] economic systems, but it later researched a broad set of problems relating to change in modern economies more generally, including [[evolutionary economics]], [[experimental economics]], and [[entrepreneurial studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.econ.mpg.de/english/institute/|title=About the Max Planck Institute of Economics|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was organized into three research units: 
* Evolutionary Economics Group (director: [[Ulrich Witt]]), 
* Strategic Interaction Group (director: [[Werner Güth]]) 
* Entrepreneurship, Growth and Public Policy Group (director: [[David B. Audretsch]]).

===Present-day===

On March 2014, the institute was renamed the Max Planck Institute for History and the Sciences. A few months later, on November 21, 2014, the Institute of Economics was realigned and renamed to the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpg.de/8281472/Institute_in_Jena_realigned|title=Institute in Jena realigned|date=June 26, 2014|accessdate=2015-04-05|publisher=Max Planck Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 it took over from the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]] the task of maintaining the [[Glottolog]].

== Location ==
The institute is located on Kahlaische Strasse, about 1 km south-east of the city center.  It is housed in an attractively restored [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] villa, linked by a glass bridge to a much larger modern building, which includes offices and other facilities for each of the research units, each unit having one floor of the main section of the building.  In addition the new buildings include a substantial library, and apartments where visitors to the institute can be accommodated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7807">'''Microbial population biology''' is the application of the principles of [[population biology]] to [[microorganisms]].

==Distinguishing from other biological disciplines==
Microbial population biology, in practice, is the application of [[population ecology]] and [[population genetics]] toward understanding the [[ecology]] and [[evolution]] of [[bacteria]], [[archaebacteria]], [[microscopic]] [[fungi]] (such as [[yeasts]]), additional microscopic [[eukaryotes]] (e.g., "[[protozoa]]" and  [[algae]]), and [[viruses]].

Microbial population biology also encompasses the evolution and ecology of community interactions ([[community ecology]]) between microorganisms, including microbial [[coevolution]] and [[predator-prey interaction]]s. In addition, microbial population biology considers microbial interactions with more macroscopic [[organism]]s (e.g., [[host (biology)|host]]-[[parasite]] interactions), though strictly this should be more from the perspective of the microscopic rather than the macroscopic organism. A good deal of microbial population biology may be described also as microbial [[evolutionary ecology]]. On the other hand, typically microbial population biologists (unlike [[microbial ecology|microbial ecologists]]) are less concerned with questions of the role of microorganisms in [[ecosystem ecology]], which is the study of [[nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]] and [[energy flow (ecology)|energy movement]] between biotic as well as abiotic components of ecosystems.

Microbial population biology can include aspects of [[molecular evolution]] or [[phylogenetics]]. Strictly, however, these emphases should be employed toward understanding issues of microbial evolution and ecology rather than as a means of understanding more universal truths applicable to both microscopic and macroscopic organisms. The microorganisms in such endeavors consequently should be recognized as organisms rather than simply as molecular or evolutionary [[reductionism|reductionist]] model systems. Thus, the study of RNA  ''[[in vitro]]'' evolution is not microbial population biology and nor is the ''[[in silico]]'' generation of phylogenies of otherwise non-microbial sequences, even if aspects of either may in some (especially unintentional) manner be analogous to evolution in actual microbial populations.

Microbial population biology can (and often does) involve the testing of more-general ecological and evolutionary hypotheses. Again, it is important to retain some emphasis on the microbe since at some point this "question-driven" microbial population biology becomes instead population biology using microorganisms. Because the point of departure of these potentially disparate emphases can be somewhat arbitrary, there exist vague and not universally accepted delimits around what the discipline of microbial population biology does and does not constitute.

== Microbial Population Biology Gordon conference ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Phage meetings]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;

A Microbial Population Biology [[Gordon Research Conferences|Gordon Research Conference]] is held every odd year, to date in New England (and usually in New Hampshire). The 2007 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060928083124/http://www.grc.org/programs/2007/micrpop.htm conference web page] introduces the meetings as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Microbial Population Biology covers a diverse range of cutting edge issues in the microbial sciences and beyond. Firmly founded in evolutionary biology and with a strongly integrative approach, past meetings have covered topics ranging from the dynamics and genetics of adaptation to the evolution of mutation rate, community ecology, evolutionary genomics, altruism, and epidemiology.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This meeting is never dull: some of the most significant and contentious issues in biology have been thrashed out here.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A history of the meeting can be found [http://www.grc.org/conferences.aspx?id=0000228 here].

The next Microbial Population Biology Gordon conference is scheduled for 2011. Information on past (and future) meetings is summarized as follows:

'''Mishra Yantra''' is one of the four distinct [[Astronomy|astronomical]] [[Scientific instrument|instrument]]s of the [[Jantar Mantar (Delhi)|Jantar Mantar]] [[observatory]] located in [[New Delhi, India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sharma |first=Virendra Nath |year=1994 |title=Míshra Yantra of the Delhi observatory |journal=Indian Journal of History of Science |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=477–487 |issn=0019-5235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each instrument at the Jantar Mantar are separate brilliant architectures constructed based on mathematical observations, and help in calculating different aspects of celestial objects and time. It is widely believed that the Jantar Mantar was constructed in the year 1724. The four instruments of Jantar Mantar are '''Samrat Yantra''' (a large [[sundial]] for calculating time), '''Jay Prakash Yantra''' (2 [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|concave]] [[hemispherical]] structures, used to ascertain the position of Sun and other heavenly bodies), '''Ram Yantra''' (two large [[cylindrical]] structures with open top, used to measure the altitude of stars based on the [[latitude]] and the [[longitude]] on the earth) and the '''Mishra Yantra''' (meaning ''mixed instrument'', since it is a compilation of five different instruments).

== Historical and cultural importance of the Misra Yantra ==
[[File:Plaque at Jantar Mantar, Delhi.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque at Jantar Mantar, Delhi (Zoom in to read)]]
The Mishra or composite Yantra is composed of five different instruments. This Yantra is unique to the Delhi observatory. It is believed to have been constructed by Maharaja Madho Singh (1751–68), the son of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II. The five component yantras are the '''Dakshinottara Bhitti''', '''Samrat''' (a smaller version of the large sundial, attached to Misra Yantra, in two halves), '''Niyat Chakra''', '''Karka Rasivalaya''', and the '''Western Quadrant'''.

The Dakshinottara Bhitti was also built in the [[Jaipur]], [[Ujjain]], [[Varanasi]] and [[Mathura]] observatories. It is a modified version of the Portable Meridian Dial present in [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Arab (etymology)|Arabic]], [[Hindu]] and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europe]]an systems of astronomy. The Dakshinottara Bhitti of the Mishra Yantra is in the form of a graduated semicircle located on the eastern wall.

'''Ozone''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|z|oʊ|n}}, or '''trioxygen''', is an inorganic [[molecule]] with the [[chemical formula]] '''{{Chem|O|3|}}'''. It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively [[pungent]] smell. It is an [[allotrope]] of [[oxygen]] that is much less stable than the [[diatomic]] allotrope {{Chem|O|2}}, breaking down in the lower atmosphere to {{Chem|O|2}} or [[dioxygen]]. Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of [[ultraviolet light]] (UV) and  electrical discharges within the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. It is present in very low concentrations throughout the latter, with its highest concentration high in the [[ozone layer]] of the [[stratosphere]], which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

Ozone's odour is reminiscent of [[chlorine]], and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as {{val|0.1|ul=ppm}} in air. Ozone's O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; structure was determined in 1865. The molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be [[diamagnetic]]. In [[standard conditions]], ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at progressively cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue [[liquid]] and finally a violet-black [[solid]]. Ozone's instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures or fast warming to the boiling point.&lt;ref name=streng&gt;{{Cite journal

It is therefore used commercially only in low concentrations.

Ozone is a powerful [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]] (far more so than dioxygen) and has many industrial and consumer applications related to oxidation. This same high oxidising potential, however, causes ozone to damage mucous and respiratory tissues in animals, and also tissues in plants, above concentrations of about {{val|0.1|u=ppm}}. While this makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground level, a higher concentration in the ozone layer (from two to eight ppm) is beneficial, preventing damaging UV light from reaching the Earth's surface.

==Nomenclature==
The [[trivial name]] ''ozone'' is the most commonly used and [[preferred IUPAC name]]. The systematic names ''2λ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-trioxidiene'' and ''catena-trioxygen'', valid [[IUPAC]] names, are constructed according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures, respectively. The name ''ozone'' derives from ''ozein'' (ὄζειν), the [[greek language|Greek]] verb for smell, referring to ozone's distinctive smell.

In appropriate contexts, ozone can be viewed as [[trioxidane]] with two hydrogen atoms removed, and as such, ''trioxidanylidene'' may be used as a context-specific systematic name, according to substitutive nomenclature. By default, these names pay no regard to the radicality of the ozone molecule. In even more specific context, this can also name the non-radical singlet ground state, whereas the diradical state is named ''trioxidanediyl''.

''Trioxidanediyl'' (or ''ozonide'') is used, non-systematically, to refer to the substituent group (-OOO-). Care should be taken to avoid confusing the name of the group for the context-specific name for ozone given above.

==History==
[[File:Schönbein.jpg|right|thumb|[[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] (18 October 1799 – 29 August 1868)]]
[[File:Smyths revised ozonometer, 1865. (9660571191).jpg|right|thumb|A prototype ozonometer built by John Smyth in 1865]]
In 1785, the Dutch chemist [[Martinus van Marum]] was conducting experiments involving electrical sparking above water when he noticed an unusual smell, which he attributed to the electrical reactions, failing to realize that he had in fact created ozone.&lt;ref name="colostate"/&gt; 

A half century later, [[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] noticed the same pungent odour and recognized it as the smell often following a bolt of [[lightning]]. In 1839, he succeeded in isolating the gaseous chemical and named it "ozone", from the Greek word ''{{lang|el|ozein}}'' ({{lang|el|ὄζειν}}) meaning "to smell".&lt;ref name="ozo"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rubin |first=Mordecai B.|year=2001 |title=The History of Ozone: The Schönbein Period, 1839–1868 |journal=[[Bull.

For much of the second half of the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth, ozone was considered a healthy component of the environment by naturalists and health-seekers. [[Beaumont, California|Beaumont]], [[California]] had as its official slogan "Beaumont: Zone of Ozone", as evidenced on postcards and Chamber of Commerce letterhead.&lt;ref&gt;Redlands Chamber of Commerce Collection, City Archives, A.K. Smiley Public Library, Redlands, CA&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalists working outdoors often considered the higher elevations beneficial because of their ozone content. "There is quite a different atmosphere [at higher elevation] with enough ozone to sustain the necessary energy [to work]", wrote naturalist [[Henry Henshaw]], working in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Henshaw to William Brewster, July 2, 1902, Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Seaside air was considered to be healthy because of its believed ozone content; but the smell giving rise to this belief is in fact that of halogenated seaweed metabolites.&lt;ref name="ashfield"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/6044238/The-science-behind-that-fresh-seaside-smell.html|title=The science behind that fresh seaside smell|accessdate=|work = The Telegraph |last = O'Connell|first = Sanjida|date = 18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of ozone's appeal seems to have resulted from its "fresh" smell, which evoked associations with purifying properties. Scientists, however, noted its harmful effects. In 1873 [[James Dewar]] and [[John Gray McKendrick]] documented that frogs grew sluggish, birds gasped for breath, and rabbits’ blood showed decreased levels of oxygen after exposure to "ozonized air", which "exercised a destructive action".&lt;ref name="Anstie"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anstie|first1=Francis|title=Clinic of the Month: Dr. McKendrick on Ozone|journal=The Practitioner: A Journal of Therapeutics and Public Health|date=1874|volume=12|issue=January–June|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrsvAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt; Schönbein himself reported that chest pains, irritation of the [[mucous membranes]] and difficulty breathing occurred as a result of inhaling ozone, and small mammals died.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Mordecai B.|title=THE HISTORY OF OZONE.

The only thoroughly well-ascertained knowledge concerning the physiological effect of ozone, so far attained, is that it causes irritation and œdema of the lungs, and death if inhaled in relatively strong concentration for any time."&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=L.|last2=Flack|first2=M.|title=The Physiological Influence of Ozone|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=28 December 1911|volume=84|issue=573|pages=404–415|doi=10.1098/rspb.1911.0086|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/84/573/404|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], ozone was tested at [[Queen Alexandra's Military Hospital]] in London as a possible [[disinfectant]] for wounds.  The gas was applied directly to wounds for as long as 15 minutes. This resulted in damage to both bacterial cells and human tissue. Other sanitizing techniques, such as irrigation with [[antiseptics]], were found preferable.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoker"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stoker |first=George | title=The Surgical Uses of Ozone| journal =Lancet |volume=188 |issue=4860 | year = 1916 | page = 712 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)31717-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==
Ozone is colourless or pale blue gas (blue when liquefied), slightly soluble in water and much more soluble in inert non-polar solvents such as [[carbon tetrachloride]] or fluorocarbons, in which it forms a blue solution. At {{convert|161|K}}, it condenses to form a dark blue [[liquid]]. It is dangerous to allow this liquid to warm to its boiling point, because both concentrated gaseous ozone and liquid ozone can detonate. At temperatures below {{convert|80|K}}, it forms a violet-black [[solid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people can detect about 0.01 μmol/mol of ozone in air where it has a very specific sharp odour somewhat resembling [[chlorine bleach]]. Exposure of 0.1 to 1 μmol/mol produces headaches, burning eyes and irritation to the respiratory passages.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite book

Even low concentrations of ozone in air are very destructive to organic materials such as latex, plastics and animal lung tissue.

Ozone is [[Diamagnetism|diamagnetic]], with all its electrons paired. In contrast, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]], containing two unpaired electrons.

==Structure==
According to experimental evidence from [[microwave spectroscopy]], ozone is a bent molecule, with C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]] (similar to the [[water]] molecule). The O – O distances are {{convert|127.2|pm|Å|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The O – O – O angle is 116.78°.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0022-2852(70)90148-7 | last1 = Tanaka | first1 = Takehiko | last2 = Morino | first2 = Yonezo | year = 1970 | title = Coriolis interaction and anharmonic potential function of ozone from the microwave spectra in the excited vibrational states |journal = Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 538–551 |bibcode = 1970JMoSp..33..538T }}&lt;/ref&gt; The central atom is ''sp''² hybridized with one lone pair. Ozone is a polar molecule with a [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]] of 0.53 [[Debye|D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mack | first1 = Kenneth M. | last2 = Muenter | first2 = J.

The arrangement possesses an overall [[bond order]] of 1.5 for both sides.

&lt;center&gt;[[File:Ozone-resonance-Lewis-2D.png|400px|Resonance Lewis structures of the ozone molecule]]&lt;/center&gt;

==Reactions==
Ozone is among the most powerful [[oxidizing]] agents known, far stronger than O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is also unstable at high concentrations, decaying into ordinary oxygen. Its [[half-life]] varies with atmospheric conditions such as temperature, humidity, and air movement. In a sealed chamber with a fan that moves the gas, ozone has a half-life of approximately one day at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Half-life time of ozone as a function of air conditions and movement McClurkin, J.D.*#1, Maier, D.E.2. {{DOI|10.5073/jka.2010.425.167.326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some unverified claims assert that ozone can have a half life of as short as thirty minutes under atmospheric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Resources/FAQs/ozone.html – Earth Science FAQ: Where can I find information about the ozone hole and ozone depletion?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601061532/http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Resources/FAQs/ozone.html |date=2006-06-01 }} ''Goddard Space Flight Center'', National Aeronautics and Space Administration, March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 {{chem|O|3}} → 3 {{chem|O|2}}

This reaction proceeds more rapidly with increasing temperature. [[Deflagration]] of ozone can be triggered by a spark and can occur in ozone concentrations of 10 [[wt%]] or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/che/jpg/papersb/full%20papers/K-106.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jlp.2005.07.020|title=Explosion properties of highly concentrated ozone gas|year=2005|last1=Koike|first1=K|last2=Nifuku|first2=M|last3=Izumi|first3=K|last4=Nakamura|first4=S|last5=Fujiwara|first5=S|last6=Horiguchi|first6=S|journal=Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries|volume=18|page=465|issue=4–6|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327085613/http://www.iitk.ac.in/che/jpg/papersb/full%20papers/K-106.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone can also be produced from oxygen at the anode of an electrochemical cell. This reaction can create smaller quantities of ozone for research purposes.

H. Freeman|year=2007|isbn=9780716776949|location=|pages=279|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be observed as an unwanted reaction in a Hoffman gas apparatus during the electrolysis of water when the voltage is set above the necessary voltage.

===With metals===
Ozone will oxidize most [[metal]]s (except [[gold]], [[platinum]], and [[iridium]]) to [[oxide]]s of the metals in their highest [[oxidation state]]. For example:

: {{chem|Cu}} + {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|Cu|O}} + {{chem|O|2}}

===With nitrogen and carbon compounds===
Ozone also oxidizes [[nitric oxide]] to [[nitrogen dioxide]]:
: NO + {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|N|O|2}} + {{chem|O|2}}
This reaction is accompanied by [[chemiluminescence]]. The {{chem|N|O|2}} can be further oxidized:
: {{chem|N|O|2}} + {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|N|O|3}} + {{chem|O|2}}
The {{chem|N|O|3}} formed can react with {{chem|N|O|2}} to form {{chem|N|2|O|5|link=Dinitrogen pentoxide}}.

Solid [[nitronium perchlorate]] can be made from NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and {{chem|O|3}} gases:
: {{chem|N|O|2}} + {{chem|Cl|O|2}} + 2 {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|N|O|2|Cl|O|4}} + 2 {{chem|O|2}}

Ozone does not react with ammonium [[Salt_(chemistry)|salt]]s, but it oxidizes [[ammonia]] to [[ammonium nitrate]]:
: 2 {{chem|N|H|3}} + 4 {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|N|H|4|N|O|3}} + 4 {{chem|O|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

Ozone reacts with [[carbon]]&lt;!--graphite?--&gt; to form [[carbon dioxide]], even at room temperature:
: C + 2 {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|C|O|2}} + 2 {{chem|O|2}}

===With sulfur compounds===
Ozone oxidises [[sulfide]]s to [[sulfate]]s. For example, [[lead(II) sulfide]] is oxidised to [[lead(II) sulfate]]:
: PbS + 4 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Sulfuric acid]] can be produced from ozone, water and either elemental [[sulfur]] or [[sulfur dioxide]]:
: S + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
: 3 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

In the [[gas phase]], ozone reacts with [[hydrogen sulfide]] to form sulfur dioxide:
: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

In an [[aqueous]] solution, however, two competing simultaneous reactions occur, one to produce elemental sulfur, and one to produce [[sulfuric acid]]:
: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → S + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
: 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 4 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

===With alkenes and alkynes===
{{main|ozonolysis}}
Alkenes can be oxidatively cleaved by ozone, in a process called [[ozonolysis]], giving alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids, depending on the second step of the workup.

:[[File:Ozonolysis scheme.svg]]

Ozone can also cleave alkynes to form a [[acid anhydride]] or [[diketone]] product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey|first= P. S. |chapter=Chapter 2| title=Ozonation in Organic Chemistry |volume=2 |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York, NY |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-12-073102-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the reaction is performed in the presence of water, the anhydride hydrolyzes to give two [[carboxylic acid]]s.

:[[File:Ozonolysis-alkyne.png|none|450px]]

Usually ozonolysis is carried out in a solution of [[dichloromethane]], at a temperature of −78&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. After a sequence of cleavage and rearrangement, an organic ozonide is formed. With reductive workup (e.g. [[zinc]] in [[acetic acid]] or [[dimethyl sulfide]]), ketones and aldehydes will be formed, with oxidative workup (e.g. aqueous or alcoholic [[hydrogen peroxide]]), carboxylic acids will be formed.&lt;ref name="OrgChem"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other substrates===

All three [[atom]]s of ozone may also react, as in the reaction of [[tin(II) chloride]] with [[hydrochloric acid]] and ozone:
: 3 SnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HCl + {{chem|O|3}} → 3 SnCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Iodine perchlorate can be made by treating [[iodine]] dissolved in cold [[anhydrous]] [[perchloric acid]] with ozone:
: I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 I(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

===Combustion===
Ozone can be used for [[combustion]] reactions and combustible gases; ozone provides higher temperatures than burning in [[dioxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The following is a reaction for the combustion of [[carbon subnitride]] which can also cause higher temperatures:

: 3 {{chem|C|4|N|2}} + 4 {{chem|O|3}} → 12 CO + 3 {{chem|N|2}}

Ozone can react at cryogenic temperatures. At {{convert|77|K}}, atomic [[hydrogen]] reacts with liquid ozone to form a hydrogen [[superoxide]] [[radical (chemistry)|radical]], which [[dimerizes]]:&lt;ref name="Horvath M. 1985. pg 44"&gt;{{cite book|year=1985|title=Ozone|pages=44–49|author1=Horvath M. |author2=Bilitzky L. |author3=Huttner J. |isbn=978-0-444-99625-1|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: H + {{chem|O|3}} → HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O
: 2 HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|H|2|O|4}}

===Reduction to ozonides===
Reduction of ozone gives the [[ozonide]] anion, O{{sup sub|−|3}}. Derivatives of this anion are explosive and must be stored at cryogenic temperatures. Ozonides for all the [[alkali metal]]s are known. KO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, RbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be prepared from their respective superoxides:
: KO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → KO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Although KO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be formed as above, it can also be formed from [[potassium hydroxide]] and ozone:&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft2nd|page=439}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: 2 KOH + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 KO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
NaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and LiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; must be prepared by action of CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in liquid NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on an [[ion exchange resin]] containing Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft2nd|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + NaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
A solution of [[calcium]] in ammonia reacts with ozone to give to ammonium ozonide and not calcium ozonide:&lt;ref name="Horvath M. 1985. pg 44"/&gt;
: 3 Ca + 10 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 {{chem|O|3}} → Ca·6NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Ca(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Applications===
Ozone can be used to remove [[iron]] and [[manganese]] from [[water]], forming a [[precipitate]] which can be filtered:
: 2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
: 2 Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 MnO(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
Ozone will also oxidize dissolved [[hydrogen sulfide]] in water to [[sulfurous acid]]:
: 3 {{chem|O|3}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

These three reactions are central in the use of ozone based well water treatment.

Ozone will also detoxify [[cyanide]]s by converting them to [[cyanate]]s.
: CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|CNO|-}} + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Ozone will also completely decompose [[urea]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1985|title=Ozone|pages=259, 269–270|author1=Horvath M. |author2=Bilitzky L. |author3=Huttner J. |isbn=978-0-444-99625-1|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone is a bent [[triatomic molecule]] with three vibrational modes: the symmetric stretch (1103.157&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), bend (701.42&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and antisymmetric stretch (1042.096&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=B4000064&amp;Units=SI&amp;Mask=800#ref-1|title = Ozone |date = |accessdate = |website =NIST: National Institute of Standards and Technology |publisher =U.S. Department of Commerce |last = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symmetric stretch and bend are weak absorbers, but the antisymmetric stretch is strong and responsible for ozone being an important minor [[greenhouse gas]]. This IR band is also used to detect ambient and atmospheric ozone although UV based measurements are more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapterurl = https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/CIMO-Guide/Ed2008Up2010/Part-I/WMO8_Ed2008_PartI_Ch16_Up2010_en.pdf|chapter= Chapter 16: Measurement of Ozone|title = Part I: Measurement of Meteorological Variables|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = World Meteorological Organization|first = |deadurl =yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160331164807/https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/CIMO-Guide/Ed2008Up2010/Part-I/WMO8_Ed2008_PartI_Ch16_Up2010_en.pdf|archivedate =31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electronic spectrum of ozone is quite complex. An overview can be seen at the MPI Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Ozone/O3_overview_log.jpg|title = The MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Max Planck Institute – Mainz|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the bands are dissociative, meaning that the molecule falls apart to {{nobr|O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} after absorbing a photon. The most important absorption is the Hartley band, extending from slightly above 300&amp;nbsp;nm down to slightly above 200&amp;nbsp;nm. It is this band that is responsible for absorbing UV&amp;nbsp;C in the stratosphere.

On the high wavelength side, the Hartley band transitions to the so-called Huggins band, which falls off rapidly until disappearing by ~360&amp;nbsp;nm. Above 400&amp;nbsp;nm, extending well out into the NIR, are the Chappius and Wulf bands. There, unstructured absorption bands are useful for detecting high ambient concentrations of ozone, but are so weak that they do not have much practical effect.

There are additional absorption bands in the far UV, which increase slowly from 200&amp;nbsp;nm down to reaching a maximum at ~120&amp;nbsp;nm.

==Ozone in Earth's atmosphere==
[[File:Atmospheric ozone.svg|thumb|The distribution of atmospheric ozone in partial pressure as a function of altitude]][[File:Nimbus ozone Brewer-Dobson circulation.jpg|thumb|Concentration of ozone as measured by the [[Nimbus program|Nimbus-7]] satellite]]
[[File:IM ozavg ept 200006.png|thumb|Total ozone concentration in June 2000 as measured by EP-TOMS satellite instrument]]
The standard way to express total ozone levels (the amount of ozone in a given vertical column) in the atmosphere is by using [[Dobson unit]]s. Point measurements are reported as [[mole fraction]]s in nmol/mol (parts per billion, ppb) or as [[concentration]]s in μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The study of ozone concentration in the atmosphere started in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albany.edu/faculty/rgk/atm101/ozmeas.htm|title=Measured Ozone Depletion| work= Ozone-Information.com| accessdate=2014-01-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130914112129/http://www.albany.edu/faculty/rgk/atm101/ozmeas.htm |archivedate = 2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ozone layer===
{{Main|Ozone layer}}

====Location and production====
The highest levels of ozone in the atmosphere are in the [[stratosphere]], in a region also known as the [[ozone layer]] between about 10&amp;nbsp;km and 50&amp;nbsp;km above the surface (or between about 6 and 31 miles). However, even in this "layer", the ozone concentrations are only two to eight parts per million, so most of the oxygen there is dioxygen, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, at about 210,000 parts per million by volume.&lt;ref name=“Hultman”&gt;{{cite book | last= Hultman | first= G. Eric | date= 1980-01-01 | title= The Ozone Survival Manual |url= |location= |publisher= McGraw-Hill |page= |isbn= 9780915498734 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone in the stratosphere is mostly produced from short-wave ultraviolet rays between 240 and 160&amp;nbsp;nm. Oxygen starts to absorb weakly at 240&amp;nbsp;nm in the Herzberg bands, but most of the oxygen is dissociated by absorption in the strong '''[[Schumann–Runge bands]]''' between 200 and 160&amp;nbsp;nm where ozone does not absorb. While shorter wavelength light, extending to even the X-Ray limit, is energetic enough to dissociate molecular oxygen, there is relatively little of it, and, the strong solar emission at Lyman-alpha, 121&amp;nbsp;nm, falls at a point where molecular oxygen absorption is a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Oxygen/O2_Lyman%20alpha%20line_lin.jpg|title = The MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest: O2, Lyman-alpha|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Keller-Rudek|first = Hannelore|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015120/http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Oxygen/O2_Lyman%20alpha%20line_lin.jpg|archivedate = 2015-11-17|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of ozone creation and destruction is called the [[Chapman cycle]] and starts with the photolysis of molecular oxygen

:{{chem|O|2}} + [[photon]] (radiation λ &lt; 240 nm) → 2 O
followed by reaction of the oxygen atom with another molecule of oxygen to form ozone.
:O + {{chem|O|2}} + M → {{chem|O|3}} + M

where "M" denotes the third body that carries off the excess energy of the reaction. The ozone molecule can then absorb a UV-C photon and dissociate

{{chem|O|3}} → O + {{chem|O|2}} + kinetic energy

The excess kinetic energy heats the stratosphere when the O atoms and the molecular oxygen fly apart and collide with other molecules. This conversion of UV light into kinetic energy warms the stratosphere. The oxygen atoms produced in the photolysis of ozone then react back with other oxygen molecule as in the previous step to form more ozone. In the clear atmosphere, with only nitrogen and oxygen, ozone can react with the atomic oxygen to form two molecules of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:{{chem|O|3}} + O → 2 {{chem|O|2}}

An estimate of the rate of this termination step to the cycling of atomic oxygen back to ozone can be found simply by taking the ratios of the concentration of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The termination reaction is [[catalysis|catalysed]] by the presence of certain free radicals, of which the most important are hydroxyl (OH), nitric oxide (NO) and atomic chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br). In the second half of the 20th Century the amount of ozone in the stratosphere was discovered to be declining, mostly because of increasing concentrations of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFC) and similar [[Haloalkane|chlorinated and brominated organic molecules]]. The concern over the health effects of the decline led to the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]], the ban on the production of many [[Ozone depletion|ozone depleting]] chemicals and in the first and second decade of the 21st Century the beginning of the recovery of stratospheric ozone concentrations.

====Importance to surface-dwelling life on Earth====
[[Image:Ozone altitude UV graph.svg|thumb|Levels of ozone at various altitudes and blocking of different bands of ultraviolet radiation. Essentially all UVC (100–280&amp;nbsp;nm) is blocked by dioxygen (at 100–200&amp;nbsp;nm) or by ozone (at 200–280&amp;nbsp;nm) in the atmosphere. The shorter portion of this band and even more energetic UV causes the formation of the ozone layer, when single oxygen atoms produced by UV [[photolysis]] of dioxygen (below 240&amp;nbsp;nm) react with more dioxygen. The ozone layer itself then blocks most, but not quite all, sunburn-producing UVB (280–315&amp;nbsp;nm). The band of UV closest to visible light, UVA (315–400&amp;nbsp;nm), is hardly affected by ozone, and most of it reaches the ground.]]

Ozone in the ozone layer filters out sunlight wavelengths from about 200&amp;nbsp;nm UV rays to 315&amp;nbsp;nm, with ozone peak absorption at about 250&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cr0205255|title=Photolysis of Atmospheric Ozone in the Ultraviolet Region|year=2003|last1=Matsumi|first1=Yutaka|last2=Kawasaki|first2=Masahiro|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=103|issue=12|pages=4767–82|pmid=14664632}} See the graphical absorption of ozone in two of its absorption bands, as a function of wavelength.&lt;/ref&gt; This ozone UV absorption is important to life, since it extends the absorption of UV by ordinary oxygen and nitrogen in air (which absorb all wavelengths &lt; 200&amp;nbsp;nm) through the lower UV-C (200–280&amp;nbsp;nm) and the entire UV-B band (280–315&amp;nbsp;nm). The small unabsorbed part that remains of UV-B after passage through ozone causes sunburn in humans, and direct DNA damage in living tissues in both plants and animals. Ozone's effect on mid-range UV-B rays is illustrated by its effect on UV-B at 290&amp;nbsp;nm, which has a radiation intensity 350 million times as powerful at the top of the atmosphere as at the surface. Nevertheless, enough of UV-B radiation at similar frequency reaches the ground to cause some sunburn, and these same wavelengths are also among those responsible for the production of [[vitamin D]] in humans.

The ozone layer has little effect on the longer UV wavelengths called UV-A (315–400&amp;nbsp;nm), but this radiation does not cause sunburn or direct DNA damage, and while it probably does cause long-term skin damage in certain humans, it is not as dangerous to plants and to the health of surface-dwelling organisms on Earth in general (see [[ultraviolet]] for more information on near ultraviolet).

===Low level ozone===
{{Main|Tropospheric ozone|Photochemical smog}}

Low level ozone (or tropospheric ozone) is an atmospheric pollutant.&lt;ref name=who-Europe&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/112199/E79097.pdf Health Aspects of Air Pollution with Particulate Matter, Ozone and Nitrogen Dioxide]. WHO-Europe report 13–15 January 2003 (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; It is not emitted directly by [[Internal combustion engine|car engines]] or by industrial operations, but formed by the reaction of sunlight on air containing [[Volatile organic compound|hydrocarbon]]s and [[nitrogen oxide]]s that react to form ozone directly at the source of the pollution or many kilometers down wind.

Ozone reacts directly with some hydrocarbons such as [[aldehyde]]s and thus begins their removal from the air, but the products are themselves key components of [[photochemical smog|smog]]. Ozone [[photolysis]] by UV light leads to production of the [[hydroxyl radical]] HO• and this plays a part in the removal of hydrocarbons from the air, but is also the first step in the creation of components of smog such as [[peroxyacyl nitrates]], which can be powerful eye irritants. The atmospheric lifetime of tropospheric ozone is about 22 days; its main removal mechanisms are being deposited to the ground, the above-mentioned reaction giving HO•, and by reactions with OH and the peroxy radical HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;•.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author =Stevenson| year=2006|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2006/2005JD006338.shtml|title=Multimodel ensemble simulations of present-day and near-future tropospheric ozone| publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]]|accessdate=2006-09-16|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence of significant reduction in agricultural yields because of increased ground-level ozone and pollution which interferes with [[photosynthesis]] and stunts overall growth of some plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2003-07-31|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/view.php?id=23565|title=Rising Ozone Levels Pose Challenge to U.S. Soybean Production, Scientists Say|publisher=NASA Earth Observatory|accessdate=2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arb.ca.gov"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mutters|first=Randall|date=March 1999|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/abstracts/94-345.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040217151427/http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/abstracts/94-345.htm|archivedate=2004-02-17|title=Statewide Potential Crop Yield Losses From Ozone Exposure|publisher=California Air Resources Board|accessdate=2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] is proposing a secondary regulation to reduce crop damage, in addition to the primary regulation designed for the protection of human health.

Certain examples of cities with elevated ozone readings are [[Houston, Texas]], and [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]. Houston has a reading of around 41 nmol/mol, while Mexico City is far more hazardous, with a reading of about 125 nmol/mol.&lt;ref name="arb.ca.gov"/&gt;

====Ozone cracking====
[[File:Ozone cracks in tube1.jpg|thumb|right|Ozone cracking in [[natural rubber]] tubing]]
Ozone gas attacks any [[polymer]] possessing olefinic or [[double bond]]s within its chain structure, such as [[natural rubber]], [[nitrile rubber]], and [[styrene-butadiene]] rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, the rate of crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding [[antiozonant]]s, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. [[Ozone cracking]] used to be a serious problem in car tires,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Layer|first1=Robert W.|last2= Lattimer|first2= Robert P.|title = Protection of Rubber against Ozone|journal = Rubber Chemistry and Technology|date = July 1990|volume = 63|number =3|pages = 426-450| doi = 10.5254/1.3538264}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, but it is not an issue with modern tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like [[gasket]]s and [[O-ring]]s, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. [[Fuel line]]s made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a [[Direct Current|DC]] [[electric motor]] can accelerate ozone cracking. The [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.

====Ozone as a greenhouse gas====
Although ozone was present at ground level before the [[Industrial Revolution]], peak concentrations are now far higher than the pre-industrial levels, and even background concentrations well away from sources of pollution are substantially higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1998|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/TOP08-98/page004.html|title=Tropospheric Ozone in EU – The consolidated report|publisher=European Environmental Agency|accessdate=2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atmospheric Chemistry and Greenhouse Gases|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/142.htm|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2006-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710143636/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/142.htm|archivedate=2006-07-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone acts as a [[greenhouse gas]], absorbing some of the [[infrared]] energy emitted by the earth. Quantifying the greenhouse gas potency of ozone is difficult because it is not present in uniform concentrations across the globe. However, the most widely accepted scientific assessments relating to [[climate change]] (e.g. the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] [[Third Assessment Report]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2001|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/|title=Climate Change 2001|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2006-09-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913043522/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/|archivedate=2006-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the [[radiative forcing]] of tropospheric ozone is about 25% that of [[carbon dioxide]].

The annual [[global warming potential]] of tropospheric ozone is between 918–1022 tons [[carbon dioxide equivalent]]/tons tropospheric ozone. This means on a per-molecule basis, ozone in the troposphere has a [[radiative forcing]] effect roughly 1,000 times as strong as [[carbon dioxide]]. However, tropospheric ozone is a short-lived [[greenhouse gas]], which decays in the atmosphere much more quickly than [[carbon dioxide]]. This means that over a 20-year span, the [[global warming potential]] of tropospheric ozone is much less, roughly 62 to 69 tons [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] / ton tropospheric ozone.&lt;ref&gt;Life Cycle Assessment Methodology Sufficient to Support Public Declarations and Claims, Committee Draft Standard, Version 2.1. Scientific Certification Systems, February 2011. Annex B, Section 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its short-lived nature, tropospheric ozone does not have strong global effects, but has very strong radiative forcing effects on regional scales. In fact, there are regions of the world where tropospheric ozone has a [[radiative forcing]] up to 150% of [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://acdb-ext.gsfc.nasa.gov/Data_services/cloud_slice/ NASA GODDARD HOMEPAGE FOR TROPOSPHERIC OZONE NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Code 613.3, Chemistry and Dynamics Branch].

[[File:SignboardAirQualityHouston.JPG|thumb|Signboard in [[Gulfton, Houston|Gulfton]], [[Houston]] indicating an ozone watch]]
[[Ozone precursors]] are a group of pollutants, predominantly those emitted during the combustion of [[fossil fuels]]. Ground-level ozone pollution ([[tropospheric ozone]]) is created near the Earth's surface by the action of daylight [[ultraviolet|UV]] rays on these precursors. The ozone at ground level is primarily from fossil fuel precursors, but [[methane]] is a natural precursor, and the very low natural background level of ozone at ground level is considered safe. This section examines the health impacts of fossil fuel burning, which raises ground level ozone far above background levels.

There is a great deal of evidence to show that ground-level ozone can harm lung function and irritate the [[respiratory system]].&lt;ref name="who-Europe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/document/E82790.pdf Answer to follow-up questions from CAFE (2004)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050909162153/http://www.euro.who.int/document/E82790.pdf |date=2005-09-09 }} (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to ozone (and the pollutants that produce it) is linked to premature [[death]], [[asthma]], [[bronchitis]], [[heart attack]], and other cardiopulmonary problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=[[EPA]] Course Developers |title=Health Effects of Ozone in the General Population |url=https://www.epa.gov/ozone-pollution-and-your-patients-health/health-effects-ozone-general-population |publisher=[[EPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18629332"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weinhold B |title=Ozone nation: EPA standard panned by the people |journal=Environ.

Long-term exposure to ozone has been shown to increase risk of death from [[respiratory illness]]. A study of 450,000 people living in United States cities saw a significant correlation between ozone levels and respiratory illness over the 18-year follow-up period.

Air quality guidelines such as those from the [[World Health Organization]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[European Union]] are based on detailed studies designed to identify the levels that can cause measurable ill [[health effect]]s.

In the USA, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] directs the EPA to set [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] for several pollutants, including ground-level ozone, and counties out of compliance with these standards are required to take steps to reduce their levels. In May 2008, under a court order, the EPA lowered its ozone standard from 80 nmol/mol to 75 nmol/mol. The move proved controversial, since the Agency's own scientists and advisory board had recommended lowering the standard to 60 nmol/mol.&lt;ref name="pmid18629332"/&gt; Many public health and environmental groups also supported the 60 nmol/mol standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comments of the American Lung Association, Environmental Defense, Sierra Club on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Proposed Revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone July 11, 2007 – 72 FR 37818 |url=http://www.lungusa.org/get-involved/advocate/advocacy-documents/Comments-to-the-Environmental-Protection-Agency-re-National-Ambient-Air-Quality-Standard-for-Ozone.PDF |format=PDF |publisher=Lungusa.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710051224/http://www.lungusa.org/get-involved/advocate/advocacy-documents/Comments-to-the-Environmental-Protection-Agency-re-National-Ambient-Air-Quality-Standard-for-Ozone.PDF |archivedate=July 10, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Health Organization]] recommends 51 nmol/mol.

On January 7, 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for the pollutant ozone, the principal component of smog:

EPA proposes that the level of the 8-hour primary standard, which was set at 0.075 μmol/mol in the 2008 final rule, should instead be set at a lower level within the range of 0.060 to 0.070 μmol/mol, to provide increased protection for children and other ‘‘at risk’’ populations against an array of {{Chem|O|3}} – related adverse health effects that range from decreased lung function and increased respiratory symptoms to serious indicators of respiratory morbidity including emergency department visits and hospital admissions for respiratory causes, and possibly cardiovascular-related morbidity as well as total non- accidental and cardiopulmonary mortality....&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/ozonepollution/fr/20100119.pdf National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone].

On October 26, 2015, the EPA published a final rule with an effective date of December 28, 2015 that revised the 8-hour primary NAAQS from 0.075 ppm to 0.070 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/26/2015-26594/national-ambient-air-quality-standards-for-ozone|title=Federal Register {{!}} National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone|website=www.federalregister.gov|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA has developed an [[Air Quality Index]] (AQI) to help explain air pollution levels to the general public. Under the current standards, eight-hour average ozone mole fractions of 85 to 104 nmol/mol are described as "unhealthy for sensitive groups", 105 nmol/mol to 124 nmol/mol as "unhealthy", and 125 nmol/mol to 404 nmol/mol as "very unhealthy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airinfonow.org/html/ed_ozone.html What is Ozone?] airinfonow.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone can also be present in [[indoor air pollution]], partly as a result of electronic equipment such as photocopiers. A connection has also been known to exist between the increased pollen, fungal spores, and ozone caused by thunderstorms and hospital admissions of [[asthma]] sufferers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=W. |last =Anderson |author2=G.J.

In the [[Victorian era]], one British folk myth held that the smell of the sea was caused by ozone. In fact, the characteristic "smell of the sea" is caused by [[dimethyl sulfide]], a chemical generated by [[phytoplankton]]. Victorian British folk considered the resulting smell "bracing".&lt;ref&gt;University of East Anglia press release, [http://www.uea.ac.uk/env/research/reshigh/cloning Cloning the smell of the seaside], February 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heat waves====
Ozone production rises during heat waves, because plants absorb less ozone. It is estimated that curtailed ozone absorption by plants was responsible for the loss of 460 lives in the UK in the hot summer of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Physiology===
{{See also|Trioxidane}}
Ozone, along with reactive forms of oxygen such as [[superoxide]], [[singlet oxygen]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], and [[hypochlorite]] ions, is produced by [[white blood cell]]s and other biological systems (such as the roots of [[Tagetes|marigold]]s) as a means of destroying foreign bodies. Ozone reacts directly with organic double bonds. Also, when ozone breaks down to dioxygen it gives rise to oxygen [[free radical]]s, which are highly reactive and capable of damaging many [[Organic compound|organic molecules]]. Moreover, it is believed that the powerful oxidizing properties of ozone may be a contributing factor of [[inflammation]]. The cause-and-effect relationship of how the ozone is created in the body and what it does is still under consideration and still subject to various interpretations, since other body chemical processes can trigger some of the same reactions. A team headed by Paul Wentworth Jr. of the Department of Chemistry at the [[Scripps Research Institute]] has shown evidence linking the antibody-catalyzed water-oxidation pathway of the human [[Immune system|immune response]] to the production of ozone. In this system, ozone is produced by antibody-catalyzed production of [[trioxidane]] from water and neutrophil-produced singlet oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Story of O| first=Roald |last=Hoffmann| journal=American Scientist|volume=92|issue= 1|page=23|date=January 2004|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/29647?&amp;print=yes| doi=10.1511/2004.1.23 |accessdate=2006-10-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060925011907/http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/29647?&amp;print=yes |archivedate = 2006-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When inhaled, ozone reacts with compounds lining the lungs to form specific, cholesterol-derived metabolites that are thought to facilitate the build-up and pathogenesis of [[atherosclerotic plaques]] (a form of [[heart disease]]). These metabolites have been confirmed as naturally occurring in human atherosclerotic arteries and are categorized into a class of secosterols termed ''[[atheronals]]'', generated by [[ozonolysis]] of cholesterol's double bond to form a [[atheronals|5,6 secosterol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Smith|first = LL|title = Oxygen, oxysterols, ouabain, and ozone: a cautionary tale|journal = Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine|volume = 37|issue = 3|pages = 318–24 |year = 2004|pmid = 15223065|doi = 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.04.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a secondary condensation product via aldolization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evidence for Ozone Formation in Human Atherosclerotic Arteries|doi=10.1126/science.1089525|author=Paul Wentworth|year=2003|journal=Science|volume=302|pmid=14605372|last2=Nieva|first2=J|last3=Takeuchi|first3=C|last4=Galve|first4=R|last5=Wentworth|first5=AD|last6=Dilley|first6=RB|last7=Delaria|first7=GA|last8=Saven|first8=A|last9=Babior|first9=BM|last10=Janda|first10=K.

Ozone has been implicated to have an adverse effect on plant growth: "... ozone reduced total chlorophylls, carotenoid and carbohydrate concentration, and increased 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) content and ethylene production. In treated plants, the ascorbate leaf pool was decreased, while lipid peroxidation and solute leakage were significantly higher than in ozone-free controls. The data indicated that ozone triggered protective mechanisms against oxidative stress in citrus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Iglesias |first = Domingo J. |author2=Ángeles Calatayuda |author3=Eva Barrenob |author4=Eduardo Primo-Milloa |author5=Manuel Talon|title = Responses of citrus plants to ozone: leaf biochemistry, antioxidant mechanisms and lipid peroxidation|journal = Plant Physiology and Biochemistry|volume = 44|issue = 2–3|pages = 125–131|year = 2006|doi = 10.1016/j.plaphy.2006.03.007|pmid = 16644230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety regulations===
Because of the strongly oxidizing properties of ozone, ozone is a primary irritant, affecting especially the eyes and respiratory systems and can be hazardous at even low concentrations. The Canadian Centre for Occupation Safety and Health reports that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Even very low concentrations of ozone can be harmful to the upper respiratory tract and the lungs. The severity of injury depends on both by the concentration of ozone and the duration of exposure. Severe and permanent lung injury or death could result from even a very short-term exposure to relatively low concentrations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-o-zone.cc/research/abstracts/OSHC.pdf What are the main health hazards associated with breathing in ozone?], Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; To protect workers potentially exposed to ozone, [[U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has established a permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 μmol/mol (29 CFR 1910.1000 table Z-1), calculated as an 8-hour time weighted average. Higher concentrations are especially hazardous and [[NIOSH]] has established an Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health Limit (IDLH) of 5 μmol/mol.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH)]: NIOSH Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values (as of 3/1/95)&lt;/ref&gt; Work environments where ozone is used or where it is likely to be produced should have adequate ventilation and it is prudent to have a monitor for ozone that will alarm if the concentration exceeds the OSHA PEL. Continuous monitors for ozone are available from several suppliers.

Elevated ozone exposure can occur on [[passenger aircraft]], with levels depending on altitude and atmospheric turbulence.&lt;ref name="portfolio"&gt;Lai, Jennifer.

==Production==
[[File:THC 2003.902.021 E. H. Johnson Ozone Production.jpg|thumb|right | Ozone production demonstration, Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, 1926]]

Ozone generators are used to produce ozone for cleaning air or removing smoke odours in unoccupied rooms. These ozone generators can produce over 3 g of ozone per hour. Ozone often forms in nature under conditions where O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will not react.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; Ozone used in industry is measured in μmol/mol (ppm, parts per million), nmol/mol (ppb, parts per billion), μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, mg/h (milligrams per hour) or weight percent. The regime of applied concentrations ranges from 1% to 5% (in air) and from 6% to 14% (in oxygen) for older generation methods. New electrolytic methods can achieve up 20% to 30% dissolved ozone concentrations in output water.

Temperature and humidity play a large role in how much ozone is being produced using traditional generation methods (such as corona discharge and ultraviolet light). Old generation methods will produce less than 50% of nominal capacity if operated with humid ambient air, as opposed to very dry air. New generators, using electrolytic methods, can achieve higher purity and dissolution through using water molecules as the source of ozone production.

===Corona discharge method===
[[File:Shkarkese elektrike.jpg|thumb|A homemade ozone generator. Ozone is produced in the corona discharge|alt=]]
This is the most common type of ozone generator for most industrial and personal uses. While variations of the "hot spark" coronal discharge method of ozone production exist, including medical grade and industrial grade ozone generators, these units usually work by means of a [[Corona discharge|corona discharge tube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|author=Smith, L. I.; Greenwood, F. L. and Hudrlik, O. |collvol=3|collvolpages=673 |volume=26|pages=63|year=1946|title=A laboratory ozonizer|prep=cv3p0673}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically cost-effective and do not require an oxygen source other than the ambient air to produce ozone concentrations of 3–6%. Fluctuations in ambient air, due to weather or other environmental conditions, cause variability in ozone production. However, they also produce [[nitrogen oxide]]s as a by-product. Use of an [[air dryer]] can reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapor and increase ozone production. Use of an [[oxygen concentrator]] can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor, but also the bulk of the nitrogen.

===Ultraviolet light===
UV ozone generators, or vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) ozone generators, employ a light source that generates a narrow-band ultraviolet light, a subset of that produced by the Sun. The Sun's UV sustains the ozone layer in the stratosphere of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dohan |first=J. M. |author2=W. J. Masschelein |year=1987 |journal=Ozone Sci. Eng.|title=Photochemical Generation of Ozone: Present State-of-the-Art |volume=9 |pages=315–334 |doi=10.1080/01919518708552147 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UV ozone generators use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or oxygen concentrator), therefore these generators tend to be less expensive.  However UV ozone generators usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], for example). Production of ozone is one of the [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation#Potential dangers|potential dangers]] of [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]]. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pool and [[spa]] applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air driers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.

===Cold plasma===
In the cold plasma method, pure oxygen gas is exposed to a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] created by [[dielectric barrier discharge]]. The diatomic oxygen is split into single atoms, which then recombine in triplets to form ozone.

Cold plasma machines utilize pure oxygen as the input source and produce a maximum concentration of about 5% ozone. They produce far greater quantities of ozone in a given space of time compared to ultraviolet production. However, because cold plasma ozone generators are very expensive, they are found less frequently than the previous two types.

The discharges manifest as filamentary transfer of electrons (micro discharges) in a gap between two electrodes. In order to evenly distribute the micro discharges, a dielectric [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] must be used to separate the metallic electrodes and to prevent arcing.

Some cold plasma units also have the capability of producing short-lived allotropes of oxygen which include O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. These species are even more reactive than ordinary {{chem|O|3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gujral, et al|first=Sarbjeet Singh|year=2013|title=Ozone Therapy: A Milestone in the Treatment of Ailments|url=http://www.iglobaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/8.-Sarbjeet-S-Gujral-et-al-IGJPS-2013_edited.pdf|journal=Indo Global Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|volume=3 |issue=2|pages=167–173|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrolytic===
Electrolytic ozone generation (EOG) splits water molecules into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
In most EOG methods, the hydrogen gas will be removed to leave oxygen and ozone as the only reaction products. Therefore, EOG can achieve higher [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] in water without other competing gases found in corona discharge method, such as nitrogen gases present in ambient air. This method of generation can achieve concentrations of 20–30% and is independent of air quality because water is used as the source material. Production of ozone electrolytically is typically unfavorable because of the high [[overpotential]] required to produce ozone as compared to oxygen. This is why ozone is not produced during typical water electrolysis. However, it is possible to increase the overpotential of oxygen by careful catalyst selection such that ozone is preferentially produced under electrolysis. Catalysts typically chosen for this approach are [[lead dioxide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Foller, Peter C. |author2=Tobias, Charles W. |title=The Anodic Evolution of Ozone|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume=129|issue=3|pages=506|doi=10.1149/1.2123890|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; or boron-doped diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Arihara, Kazuki |author2=Terashima, Chiaki |author3=Fujishimam Akira |title= Electrochemical Production of High-Concentration Ozone-Water Using Freestanding Perforated Diamond Electrodes|journal= Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume= 154|issue= 4|pages= E71|doi= 10.1149/1.2509385|year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special considerations===
Ozone cannot be stored and transported like other industrial gases (because it quickly decays into diatomic oxygen) and must therefore be produced on site. Available ozone generators vary in the arrangement and design of the high-voltage electrodes. At production capacities higher than 20&amp;nbsp;kg per hour, a gas/water tube heat-exchanger may be utilized as ground electrode and assembled with tubular high-voltage electrodes on the gas-side. The regime of typical gas pressures is around {{convert|2|bar|lk=on}} absolute in oxygen and {{convert|3|bar}} absolute in air. Several megawatts of [[electric power|electrical power]] may be installed in large facilities, applied as one phase AC [[Electric current|current]] at 50 to 8000&amp;nbsp;Hz and peak [[voltage]]s between 3,000 and 20,000 volts. Applied voltage is usually inversely related to the applied frequency.

The dominating parameter influencing ozone generation efficiency is the gas temperature, which is controlled by cooling water temperature and/or gas velocity. The cooler the water, the better the ozone synthesis. The lower the gas velocity, the higher the concentration (but the lower the net ozone produced). At typical industrial conditions, almost 90% of the effective power is dissipated as heat and needs to be removed by a sufficient cooling water flow.

Because of the high reactivity of ozone, only a few materials may be used like [[stainless steel]] (quality 316L), [[titanium]], [[aluminium]] (as long as no moisture is present), [[glass]], [[polytetrafluorethylene]], or [[polyvinylidene fluoride]]. [[Viton]] may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). [[Hypalon]] may be used with the restriction that no water come in contact with it, except for normal atmospheric levels. [[Embrittlement]] or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like [[O-rings]].

[[Silicone rubber]]s are usually adequate for use as [[gaskets]] in ozone concentrations below 1 wt%, such as in equipment for accelerated aging of rubber samples.

===Incidental production===
Ozone may be formed from {{chem|O|2}} by electrical discharges and by action of high energy [[electromagnetic radiation]]. [[Arc suppression|Unsuppressed arcing]] in electrical contacts, motor brushes, or mechanical switches breaks down the chemical bonds of the atmospheric oxygen surrounding the contacts [{{chem|O|2}} → 2O]. Free radicals of oxygen in and around the arc recombine to create ozone [{{chem|O|3}}].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lab Note #106 ''Environmental Impact of Arc Suppression'' | publisher = Arc Suppression Technologies | date = April 2011 | url = http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/ | accessdate = October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[electrical equipment]] generate significant levels of ozone. This is especially true of devices using [[high voltage]]s, such as [[Air ioniser|ionic air purifiers]], [[laser printer]]s, [[photocopier]]s, [[electroshock weapon|tasers]] and [[arc welding|arc welders]]. [[Electric motor]]s using [[brush (electric)|brush]]es can generate ozone from repeated [[spark gap|spark]]ing inside the unit. Large motors that use brushes, such as those used by elevators or hydraulic pumps, will generate more ozone than smaller motors.

Ozone is similarly formed in the [[Catatumbo lightning|Catatumbo lightning storms]] phenomenon on the [[Catatumbo River]] in [[Venezuela]], though ozone's instability makes it dubious that it has any effect on the ozonosphere.&lt;ref name="Zulia"&gt;[http://www.agenciadenoticias.luz.edu.ve/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4965&amp;Itemid=151 ¿Relámpagos del Catatumbo regeneran la capa de ozono?]. Agencia de noticias de la [[Universidad del Zulia]].&lt;/ref&gt;
It is the world's largest single natural generator of ozone, lending calls for it to be designated a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name="meteo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire in the Sky|url=http://www.meteogroup.co.uk/uk/home/weather/weather_news/news_archive/archive/2007/november/ch/f540146dcc/article/fire_in_the_sky.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721215231/http://www.meteogroup.co.uk/uk/home/weather/weather_news/news_archive/archive/2007/november/ch/f540146dcc/article/fire_in_the_sky.html|archivedate=2011-07-21|accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory production===
In the laboratory, ozone can be produced by [[electrolysis]] using a [[9 volt battery]], a pencil graphite rod [[cathode]], a [[platinum]] wire [[anode]] and a 3 [[molar (concentration)|molar]] [[sulfuric acid]] [[electrolyte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ibanez|first=Jorge G. |author2=Rodrigo Mayen-Mondragon |author3=M. T. Moran-Moran|year=2005|title=Laboratory Experiments on the Electrochemical Remediation of the Environment.

: 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 6 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Table of standard electrode potentials|ΔE&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;]] = −1.53 [[Volt|V]])
: 6 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 6 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (ΔE&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 V)
: 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (ΔE&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.23 V)

In the net reaction, three equivalents of water are converted into one equivalent of ozone and three equivalents of [[hydrogen]]. Oxygen formation is a competing reaction.

It can also be generated by a [[high voltage]] [[Electric arc|arc]]. In its simplest form, high voltage AC, such as the output of a [[Neon-sign transformer]] is connected to two metal rods with the ends placed sufficiently close to each other to allow an arc. The resulting arc will convert atmospheric oxygen to ozone.

It is often desirable to contain the ozone. This can be done with an apparatus consisting of two concentric glass tubes sealed together at the top with gas ports at the top and bottom of the outer tube. The inner core should have a length of metal foil inserted into it connected to one side of the power source. The other side of the power source should be connected to another piece of foil wrapped around the outer tube. A source of dry  {{chem|O|2}} is applied to the bottom port. When high voltage is applied to the foil leads, [[electricity]] will discharge between the dry dioxygen in the middle and form {{chem|O|3}} and {{chem|O|2}} which will flow out the top port. The reaction can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name=brown /&gt;

: 3 {{chem|O|2}} — ''electricity'' → 2 {{chem|O|3}}

==Applications==

===Industry===
The largest use of ozone is in the preparation of [[pharmaceuticals]], [[synthetic lubricants]], and many other commercially useful [[organic compounds]], where it is used to sever [[carbon]]-carbon bonds.&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; It can also be used for [[Bleach (chemical)|bleach]]ing substances and for killing microorganisms in air and water sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ozonesolutions.com/Ozone_Color_Removal.html|work = Ozone Information|title = Ozone and Color Removal| accessdate = 2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many municipal drinking water systems kill bacteria with ozone instead of the more common [[chlorine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoigné |first= J.|title=Handbook of Environmental Chemistry, Vol. 5 part C|pages=83–141|year=1998 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone has a very high [[oxidation potential]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ozone-information.com/Oxidation_Potential_Ozone.html|title=Oxidation Potential of Ozone| work= Ozone-Information.com| accessdate=2008-05-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080419034421/http://www.ozone-information.com/Oxidation_Potential_Ozone.html |archivedate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone does not form [[organochlorine]] compounds, nor does it remain in the water after treatment. Ozone can form the suspected carcinogen [[bromate]] in source water with high [[bromide]] concentrations. The U.S. [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] mandates that these systems introduce an amount of chlorine to maintain a minimum of 0.2 μmol/mol residual [[free chlorine]] in the pipes, based on results of regular testing. Where [[Electric power|electrical power]] is abundant, ozone is a cost-effective method of treating water, since it is produced on demand and does not require transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals. Once it has decayed, it leaves no taste or odour in drinking water.

Although low levels of ozone have been advertised to be of some disinfectant use in residential homes, the concentration of ozone in dry air required to have a rapid, substantial effect on airborne pathogens exceeds safe levels recommended by the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] and [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. Humidity control can vastly improve both the killing power of the ozone and the rate at which it decays back to oxygen (more humidity allows more effectiveness). [[Spore]] forms of most pathogens are very tolerant of atmospheric ozone in concentrations at which asthma patients start to have issues.

Industrially, ozone is used to:

Ozone is a [[reagent]] in many [[organic reactions]] in the laboratory and in industry. [[Ozonolysis]] is the cleavage of an [[alkene]] to [[carbonyl]] compounds.

Many hospitals around the world use large ozone generators to decontaminate operating rooms between surgeries. The rooms are cleaned and then sealed airtight before being filled with ozone which effectively kills or neutralizes all remaining bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Boer |first1=Hero E.

Ozone can be used to detoxify [[cyanide]] wastes (for example from [[gold]] and [[silver]] [[mining]]) by oxidising cyanide to [[cyanate]] and eventually to [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bollyky |first= L.

===Consumers===
{{see also|Air purifier#Potential ozone hazards}}
Devices generating high levels of ozone, some of which use ionization, are used to sanitize and deodorize uninhabited buildings, rooms, ductwork, woodsheds, boats and other vehicles.

In the U.S., [[air purifier]]s emitting low levels of ozone have been sold. This kind of air purifier is sometimes claimed to imitate nature's way of purifying the air without filters and to sanitize both it and household surfaces. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has declared that there is "evidence to show that at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone is not effective at removing many odor-causing chemicals" or "viruses, bacteria, mold, or other biological pollutants". Furthermore, its report states that "results of some controlled studies show that concentrations of ozone considerably higher than these [human safety] standards are possible even when a user follows the manufacturer’s operating instructions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/ozonegen.html EPA report on consumer ozone air purifiers]. Epa.gov. Retrieved on 2012-02-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozonated water is used to launder clothes and to sanitize food, drinking water, and surfaces in the home. According to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), it is "amending the [[food additive]] regulations to provide for the safe use of ozone in gaseous and aqueous phases as an [[Antimicrobial|antimicrobial agent]] on food, including meat and poultry." Studies at [[California Polytechnic State University|California Polytechnic University]] demonstrated that 0.3 μmol/mol levels of ozone dissolved in filtered tapwater can produce a reduction of more than 99.99% in such food-borne microorganisms as salmonella, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 and ''Campylobacter''. This quantity is 20,000 times the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]-recommended limits stated above.&lt;ref name="food"&gt;{{cite web|last=Montecalvo |first=Joseph |author2=Doug Williams |title=Application of Ozonation in Sanitizing Vegetable Process Washwaters |publisher=California Polytechnic State University |url=http://www.cwtozone.com/files/articles/Food_Produce/Article%20-%20Veg.%20Process%20washwater.pdf |accessdate=2008-03-24 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528140629/http://www.cwtozone.com/files/articles/Food_Produce/Article%20-%20Veg.%20Process%20washwater.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Long| first=Ron| year=2008| url=http://www.purityintl.com/Article%20POU.pdf| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715132442/http://www.purityintl.com/Article%20POU.pdf| archivedate=2011-07-15| format=PDF| title=POU Ozone Food Sanitation: A Viable Option for Consumers &amp; the Food Service Industry}} (the report also shows that tapwater removes 99.95% of pathogens from lettuce; samples were inoculated with pathogens before treatment)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone is used in homes and [[hot tub]]s to kill bacteria in the water and to reduce the amount of chlorine or bromine required by reactivating them to their free state. Since ozone does not remain in the water long enough, ozone by itself is ineffective at preventing cross-contamination among bathers and must be used in conjunction with [[halogens]]. Gaseous ozone created by ultraviolet light or by corona discharge is injected into the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/mdbp/upload/2001_07_13_mdbp_alternative_disinfectants_guidance.pdf |format=PDF|title=Alternative Disinfectants and Oxidant Guidance Manual|date=April 1999|publisher = [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=2008-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone is also widely used in treatment of water in aquariums and fish ponds. Its use can minimize bacterial growth, control parasites, eliminate transmission of some diseases, and reduce or eliminate "yellowing" of the water. Ozone must not come in contact with fish's gill structures. Natural salt water (with life forms) provides enough "instantaneous demand" that controlled amounts of ozone activate bromide ion to [[hypobromous acid]], and the ozone entirely decays in a few seconds to minutes. If oxygen fed ozone is used, the water will be higher in dissolved oxygen, fish's gill structures will atrophy and they will become dependent on higher dissolved oxygen levels.

===Aquaculture===
Ozonation – a process of infusing water with ozone – can be used in aquaculture to facilitate organic breakdown. Ozone is also added to recirculating systems to reduce [[nitrite]] levels&lt;ref name="Noble"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0959-8030(96)90006-X | last1 = Noble | first1 = A.C. | last2 = Summerfelt | first2 = S.T. | year = 1996 | title = Diseases encountered in rainbow trout cultured in recirculating systems |journal = Annual Review of Fish Diseases | volume = 6 |pages = 65–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through conversion into [[nitrate]]. If nitrite levels in the water are high, nitrites will also accumulate in the blood and tissues of fish, where it interferes with oxygen transport (it causes oxidation of the heme-group of [[haemoglobin]] from ferrous ({{chem|Fe|2+}}) to ferric ({{chem|Fe|3+}}), making haemoglobin unable to bind {{chem|O|2}}).&lt;ref name="Ferreira"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0044-8486(03)00524-6 | last1 = Ferreira | first1 = O| last2 = de Costa | first2 = O.T. | last3 = Ferreira | first3 = Santos | last4 = Mendonca | first4 = F. | year = 2004 | title = Susceptibility of the Amazonian fish, Colossoma macropomum (Serrasalminae), to short-term exposure to nitrite |journal = Aquaculture | volume = 232 |pages = 627–636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these apparent positive effects, ozone use in recirculation systems has been linked to reducing the level of bioavailable iodine in salt water systems, resulting in iodine deficiency symptoms such as goitre and decreased growth in Senegalese sole (''[[Solea senegalensis]]'') larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ribeiro | first1 = A.R.A. | last2 = Ribeiro | first2 = L. | last3 = Saele | first3 = Ø. | last4 = Hamre | first4 = K. | last5 = Dinis | first5 = M.T. | last6 = Moren | first6 = M. | title = Iodine-enriched rotifers andArtemiaprevent goitre in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) larvae reared in a recirculation system | journal = Aquaculture Nutrition | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2095.2009.00740.x | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 248–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozonate seawater is used for surface disinfection of [[haddock]] and [[Atlantic halibut]] eggs against nodavirus. Nodavirus is a lethal and vertically transmitted virus which causes severe mortality in fish. Haddock eggs should not be treated with high ozone level as eggs so treated did not hatch and died after 3–4 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.aquaeng.2005.10.001 | last1 = Buchan | first1 = K. | last2 = Martin-Robinchaud | first2 = D. | last3 = Benfey | first3 = T.J. | last4 = MacKinnon | year = 2006 | first4 = A | last5 = Boston | first5 = L | title = The efficacy of ozonated seawater for surface disinfection of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) eggs against piscine nodavirus |journal = Aquacultural Engineering | volume = 35 |pages = 102–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
Ozone application on freshly cut pineapple and banana shows increase in flavonoids and total phenol contents when exposure is up to 20 minutes. Decrease in [[ascorbic acid]] (one form of [[vitamin C]]) content is observed but the positive effect on total phenol content and flavonoids can overcome the negative effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ifset.2010.08.008 | last1 = Alothman | first1 = M. | last2 = Kaur | first2 = B. | last3 = Fazilah | first3 = A. | last4 = Bhat | year = 2010 | first4 = Rajeev | last5 = Karim | first5 = Alias A. | title = Ozone-induced changes of antioxidant capacity of fresh-cut tropical fruits |journal = Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 666–671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomatoes upon treatment with ozone shows an increase in β-carotene, lutein and lycopene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.postharvbio.2007.03.004 | last1 = Tzortzakis | first1 = N. | last2 = Borland | first2 = A. | last3 = Singleton | first3 = I. | year = 2007 | last4 = Barnes | first4 = J | title = Impact of atmospheric ozone-enrichment on quality-related attributes of tomato fruit |journal = Postharvest Biology and Technology | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 317–325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ozone application on strawberries in pre-harvest period shows decrease in ascorbic acid content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.postharvbio.2007.12.003 | last1 = Keutgen | first1 = A.J. | last2 = Pawelzik | first2 = E. | year = 2008 | title = Influence of pre-harvest ozone exposure on quality of strawberry fruit under simulated retail conditions |journal = Postharvest Biology and Technology | volume = 49 |pages = 10–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone facilitates the extraction of some heavy metals from soil using [[EDTA]]. EDTA forms strong, water-soluble coordination compounds with some heavy metals ([[Lead|Pb]], [[Zinc|Zn]]) thereby making it possible to dissolve them out from contaminated soil. If contaminated soil is pre-treated with ozone, the extraction efficacy of [[Lead|Pb]], [[Americium|Am]] and [[Plutonium|Pu]] increases by 11.0–28.9%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.03.005 | last1 = Lestan | first1 = D. | last2 = Hanc | first2 = A. | last3 = Finzgar | first3 = N. | year = 2005 | title = Influence of ozonation on extractability of Pb and Zn from contaminated soils |journal = Chemosphere | volume = 61 | issue = 7| pages = 1012–1019 | pmid = 16257321 | bibcode = 2005Chmsp..61.1012L }}&lt;/ref&gt; 43.5%&lt;ref name="Plaue"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1524/ract.91.6.309.20026 | last1 = Plaue | first1 = J.W. | last2 = Czerwinski | first2 = K.R. | year = 2003 | title = The influence of ozone on ligand-assisted extraction of 239Pu and 241Am from rocky flats soil |journal = Radiochim.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24222">'''Political economy of climate change''' is an approach that applies the [[political economy]] thinking of collective or political processes to study the critical issues surrounding the decision-making on climate change.

As the issue of [[climate change]] reaching the top of international agenda, the complexity of the [[environmental problems]] in combination with various other social political challenges have put great pressures on the scholars to explore a better understanding of the multiple actors and influencing factors that affect the climate change negotiation and to seek more effective solutions to [[Climate change mitigation|tackle climate change]]. Analyzing these issues from a political economy perspective helps to explain the complex interactions between different stakeholders in respond to climate change impacts and provides broader opportunities to achieve better implementation of [[Climate change policy|climate change policies]].

Climate Change is first and foremost a political issue now that it has become a widely believed fact. Before tackling the issue, it is important to determine how drastic the effects can be in order to address it in an appropriate manner. When dealing with climate change, the inhabitants of countries must see themselves as “global citizens” rather than separate entities if any real long-term progress is to be made. In accordance with a global perspective, countries balance legislation regarding climate change in a way that benefits developing nations while refraining from discouraging developed nations from contributing to the effort. 

== Introduction ==
=== Background ===
Climate change and [[global warming]] have become one of the most pressing [[environmental concerns]] and the greatest global challenges in society today, despite the fact that a consensus has never been reached in the debates over its causes and consequences. As this issue continues to dominate the international agenda, researchers from different academic sectors have for long been devoting great efforts to explore effective solutions to climate change, with technologists and planners devising ways of [[Climate change adaptation|mitigating]] and [[Climate change adaptation|adapting]] to climate change; economists estimating the cost of climate change and the cost of tackling it; development experts exploring the impact of climate change on social services and public goods. However, Cammack (2007)&lt;ref name="one"&gt;Cammack, D. (2007) ''Understanding the political economy of climate change is vital to tackling it'', Prepared by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] for UN Climate Change Conference in Bali, December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; points out two problems with many of the above discussions, namely the disconnection between the proposed solutions to climate change from different disciplines; and the devoid of politics in addressing climate change at the local level. Further, the issue of climate change is facing various other challenges, such as the problem of elite-resource capture, the resource constraints in [[Developing country|developing countries]] and the conflicts that frequently result from such constraints, which have often been less concerned and stressed in suggested solutions. In recognition of these problems, it is advocated that “understanding the political economy of climate change is vital to tackling it”.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the unequal distribution of the impacts of climate change and the resulting inequity and unfairness on the poor who contribute least to the problem have linked the issue of climate change with development study,&lt;ref&gt;Adger, W.N., Paavola, Y., Huq, S. and Mace, M.J. (2006) ''Fairness in Adaptation to Climate Change'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tol | first1 = R.S.J. | last2 = Downing | first2 = T.E. | last3 = Kuik | first3 = O.J. | last4 = Smith | first4 = J.B. | year = 2004 | title = Distributional Aspects of Climate Change Impacts | url = | journal = [[Global Environmental Change]] | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 259–72 | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2004.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has given rise to various programmes and policies that aim at addressing climate change and promoting development.&lt;ref&gt;IEA, UNDP and UNIDO (2010) Energy Poverty: ''How to Make Modern Energy Access Universal?,'' special early excerpt of the [[World Energy Outlook]] 2010 for the UN General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals, Paris: OECD/IEA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nabuurs, G.J., Masera, O., Andrasko, K., Benitez-Ponce, P., Boer, R., Dutschke, M., Elsiddig, E., Ford-Robertson, J., Frumhoff, P., Karjalainen, T., Krankina, O., Kurz, W.A., Matsumoto, M., Oyhantcabal, W., Ravindranath, N.H., Sanz Sanchez, M.J. and Zhang, X. (2007) ‘Forestry’, in: ''Mitigation of Climate Change'', Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Although great efforts have been made on international negotiations concerning the issue of climate change, it is argued that much of the theory, debate, evidence-gathering and implementation linking climate change and development assume a largely apolitical and linear policy process.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;6.	Tanner, T. and Allouche, J. (2011) 'Towards a New Political Economy of Climate Change and Development', ''IDS Bulletin Special Issue: Political Economy of Climate Change'', '''42'''(3): 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, Tanner and Allouche (2011) suggest that [[List of climate change initiatives|climate change initiatives]] must explicitly recognise the political economy of their inputs, processes and outcomes so as to find a balance between effectiveness, efficiency and equity.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

=== Definition ===
In its earliest manifestations, the term “political economy” was basically a [[synonym]] of [[economics]],&lt;ref&gt;Groenewegen, E.(1987) 'Political economy and economics', in: Eatwell J. et al., eds., ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', Vol.3: 904-907, Macmillan &amp; Co., London.&lt;/ref&gt; while it is now a rather elusive term that typically refers to the study of the collective or political processes through which public economic decisions are made.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;Oates, W.E.and Portney, P.R.(2003) 'The political economy of environmental policy', in: ''Handbook of Environmental Economics'', chapter 08: p325-54&lt;/ref&gt; In the climate change domain, Tanner and Allouche (2011) define the political economy as “the processes by which ideas, power and resources are conceptualised, negotiated and implemented by different groups at different scales”.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; While there have emerged a substantial literature on the political economy of [[environmental policy]], which explains the “political failure” of the environmental programmes to efficiently and effectively protect the environment,&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; systematic analysis on the specific issue of climate change using the political economy framework is relatively limited.

== Current Context: The Urgent Need for Political Economy ==

=== Characteristics of Climate Change ===
The urgent need to consider and understand the political economy of climate change is based on the specific characteristics of the problem.

The key issues include:
* '''The cross-sectoral nature of climate change''': The issue of climate change usually fits into various sectors, which means that the integration of climate change policies into other policy areas is frequently called for.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2009) ''Policy Guidance on Integrating Climate Change Adaptation into Development Co-operation'', Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, this has resulted in the highly complexity of the issue, as the problem needs to be addressed from multiple scales with diverse actors involved in the complex [[governance]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rabe | first1 = B.G. | year = 2007 | title = Beyond Kyoto: Climate Change Policy in Multilevel Governance Systems | url = | journal = [[Governance (journal)|Governance: An International Journal of Policy, Administration, and Institutions]] | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 423–44 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2007.00365.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction of these facets leads to the political processes with multiple and overlapping conceptualisation, negotiation and governance issues, which requires the understanding of political economy processes.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;
* '''The problematic perception of climate change as simply a “global” issue''': Climate change initiatives and governance approaches have tended to be driven from the global scale. While the development of international agreements has witnessed a progressive step of global political action, this globally-led governance of climate change issue may be unable to provide adequate flexibility for specific national or sub-national conditions. Besides, from the development perspective of view, the issue of equity and global environmental justice would require a fair international regime within which the impact of [[climate change and poverty]] could be simultaneously prevented. In this context, climate change is not only a global crisis that needs the presence of international politics, but also a challenge for national or [[Sub-national entity|sub-national]] governments. The understanding of the political economy of climate change could explain the formulation and translation of international initiatives to specific national and sub-national policy context, which provides an important perspective to tackle climate change and achieve [[environmental justice]].&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;
* '''The growth of climate change finance''': Recent years have witnessed a growing number of financial flows and development of financing mechanisms in the climate change arena. The [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Cancun]], Mexico has committed significant amount of money from [[developed countries]] to developing world in supportive of the adaptation and mitigation technologies. In short terms, the fast start finance will be transferred through variety channels including bilateral and multilateral official development assistance, the [[Global Environment Facility]] and the [[UNFCCC]].&lt;ref&gt;Harmeling, S. and Kaloga, A. (2011)'Understanding the Political Economy of the Adaptation Fund', ''IDS Bulletin Special Issue: Political Economy of Climate Change'', '''42'''(3): 23-32&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, a growing number of public funds have provided greater incentives to tackle climate change in developing countries. For instance, the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience aims at creating an integrated and scaled-up approach of climate change adaptation in some low-income countries and preparing for future finance flows. In addition, climate change finance in developing countries could potentially change the traditional aid mechanisms, through the differential interpretations of [[Kyoto Protocol|‘common but differentiated responsibilities’]] by developing and developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Okereke | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Equity Norms in Global Environmental Governance | url = | journal = Global Environmental Politics | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 25–50 | doi=10.1162/glep.2008.8.3.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of equity and [[climate justice]], climate change resource flows are increasingly called on developed world according to the culpability for damages.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah, A., Muyungi, R., Jallow, B., Reazuddin, M. and Konate, M. (2009) ''National Adaptation Funding: Ways Forward for the Poorest Countries'', IIED Briefing Paper, International Institute for Environment and Development, London.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is inevitable to change the governance structures so as for developing countries to break the traditional donor-recipient relationships. Within these contexts, the understanding of the political economy processes of financial flows in climate change arena would be crucial to effectively governing the resource transfer and to tackling the climate change.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;
* '''Different [[ideological]] worldviews of responding to climate change''': Nowadays, because of the perception of science as a dominant policy driver, much of the policy prescription and action in climate change arena have concentrated on assumptions around standardised governance and planning systems, linear policy processes, readily transferable technology, economic rationality, and the ability of science and technology to overcome resource gaps.&lt;ref&gt;Leach, M., Scoones, I. and Stirling, A. (2010), ''Dynamic Sustainabilities–Technology, Environment, Social Justice'', London: [[Earthscan]].&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there tends to be a bias towards technology-led and managerial approaches to address climate change in apolitical terms. Besides, a wide range of different ideological worldviews would lead to a high divergence of the perception of climate change solutions, which also has a great influence on decisions made in response to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carvalho | first1 = A | year = 2007 | title = Ideological Cultures and Media Discourses on Scientific Knowledge: Re-reading News on Climate Chang | url = | journal = [[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 223–43 | doi=10.1177/0963662506066775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploring these issues from a political economy perspective provides the opportunity to better understand the “complexity of politic and decision-making processes in tackling climate change, the power relations mediating competing claims over resources, and the contextual conditions for enabling the adoption of technology”.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;
* '''Unintended negative consequences of adaptation policies that fail to factor in environmental-economic trade-offs''': Successful adaptation to climate change requires balancing competing economic, social, and political interests. In the absence of such balancing, harmful unintended consequences can undo the benefits of adaptation initiatives. For example, efforts to protect coral reefs in Tanzania forced local villagers to shift from traditional fishing activities to farming that produced higher greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Editorial|title=Adaptation trade-offs|journal=Nature Climate Change|date=November 2015|volume=5|page=957|url=http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v5/n11/pdf/nclimate2853.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2016|doi=10.1038/nclimate2853}} See also Sovacool, B. and Linnér, B.-O. (2016), ''The Political Economy of Climate Change Adaptation,'' Palgrave Macmillan UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socio-political Constraints ===
The role of political economy in understanding and tackling climate change is also founded upon the key issues surrounding the domestic socio-political constraints:&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

* '''The problems of''' '''[[fragile state]]s''': Fragile states—defined as poor performers, conflict and/or post-conflict states—are usually incapable of using the aid for climate change effectively. The issues of power and social equity have exacerbated the climate change impacts, while insufficient attention has been paid to the dysfunction of fragile states. Considering the problems of fragile states, the political economy approach could improve the understanding of the long-standing constraints upon capacity and resilience, through which the problems associated with weak capacity, state-building and conflicts could be better addressed in the context of climate change.
* ''' Informal governance:''' In many poorly performing states, [[decision-making]] around the distribution and use of state resources is driven by informal relations and private incentives rather than formal state institutions that are based on equity and law. This informal governance nature that underlies in the domestic social structures prevents the political systems and structures from rational functioning and thus hinders the effective response towards climate change. Therefore, domestic institutions and incentives are critical to the adoption of reforms. Political economy analysis provides an insight into the underlying social structures and systems that determine the effectiveness of climate change initiatives (1).
* '''The difficulty of social change:''' Developmental change underdeveloped countries is painfully slow because of a series of long-tem collective problems, including the societies’ incapacity of working collectively to improve wellbeing, the lack of technical and social ingenuity, the resistance and rejection to innovation and change. In the context of climate change, these problems significantly hinder the promotion of climate change agenda. Taking a political economy view at the underdeveloped countries could help to understand and create incentives to promote transformation and development, which lays a foundation for the expectation of implementing a climate change adaptation agenda.

== Research focuses and approaches ==

Brandt and Svendsen (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, U.S. and  Svendsen, G.T. (2003) ''The Political Economy of Climate Change Policy in the EU: Auction and Grandfathering'', IME Working Papers No. 51/03.&lt;/ref&gt; introduce a political economy framework that based on the political support function model by Hillman (1982)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hillman | first1 = A.L. | year = 1982 | title = Declining industries and political-support protec-tionist motives | url = | journal = [[The American Economic Review]] | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 1180–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; into the analysis of the choice of instruments to control climate change in the [[European Union]] policy to implement its [[Kyoto Protocol]] target level. In this political economy framework, the climate change policy is determined by the relative strength of stakeholder groups. By examining the different objective of different interest groups, namely industry groups, consumer groups and environmental groups, the authors explain the complex interaction between the choices of instrument for the EU climate change policy, specifically the shift from the green taxation to a grandfathered permit system.

A report by the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD) (2011) takes a political economy approach to explain why some countries adopt climate change policies while others do not, specifically among the countries in the transition region.&lt;ref&gt;EBRD (2011) 'Political economy of climate change policy in the transition region', in: ''Special Report on Climate Change: The Low Carbon Transition, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development'', Chapter Four.&lt;/ref&gt; This work analyzes the different political economy aspects of the characteristics of climate change policies so as to understand the likely factors driving climate change mitigation outcomes in many [[Transition country#Countries in transition|transition countries]]. The main conclusions are listed below:
* The level of [[democracy]] alone is not a major driver of climate change policy adoption, which means that the expectations of contribution to global climate change mitigation are not necessarily limited by the political regime of a given country.
* Public knowledge, shaped by various factors including the threat of climate change in a particular country, the national level of education and existence of free media, is a critical element in climate change policy adoption, as countries with the public more aware of the climate change causes are significantly more likely to adopt climate change policies. The focus should therefore be on promoting public awareness of the urgent threat of climate change and prevent [[information asymmetry|information asymmetries]] in many transition countries.
* The relative strength of the carbon-intensive industry is a major deterrent to the adoption of climate change policies, as it partly accounts for the information asymmetries. However, the carbon-intensive industries often influence government’s decision-making on climate change policy, which thus calls for a change of the incentives perceived by these industries and a transition of them to a low-carbon production pattern. Efficient means include the energy price reform and the introduction of international [[Emissions trading|carbon trading]] mechanisms.
* The competitive edge gained national economies in the transition region in a global economy, where increasing international pressure is put to reduce emissions, would enhance their political regime’s domestic legitimacy, which could help to address the inherent economic weaknesses underlying the lack of economic diversification and global economic crisis.

Tanner and Allouche (2011)&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; propose a new conceptual and methodological framework for analysing the political economy of climate change in their latest work, which focuses on the climate change policy processes and outcomes in terms of ideas, power and resources. The new political economy approach is expected to go beyond the dominant political economy tools formulated by international development agencies to analyse climate change initiatives&lt;ref&gt;DFID (2009) ''Political Economy Analysis: How to Note'', DFID Practice Paper, [[Department for International Development]], London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Bank (2009) ''Problem-Driven Governance and Political Economy Analysis: Good Practice Framework'', [[World Bank]], Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Bank (2004) ''Operationalizing Political Analysis: The Expected Utility Stakeholder Model and Governance Reforms'', PREM Notes 95, World Bank, Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; that have ignored the way that ideas and ideologies determine the policy outcomes (see [[#table-comparison|table]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, M.N. and Finnemore, M. (2004) ''Rules for the World: International Organizations in Global Politics'', [[Cornell University Press]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors assume that each of the three lenses, namely ideas, power and resources, tends to be predominant at one stage of the policy process of the political economy of climate change, with “ideas and ideologies predominant in the conceptualisation phase, power in the negotiation phase and resource, institutional capacity and governance in the implementation phase”.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; It is argued that These elements are critical in the formulation of international climate change initiatives and their translation to national and sub-national policy context.

'''Pornography addiction''' is an addiction model of [[compulsive]] sexual activity with concurrent use of [[pornographic]] material, despite negative consequences to one's physical, mental, social, or financial well-being. Although "viewing pornography online" is mentioned in the [[DSM-5]], it is not considered a [[mental disorder]], and it and pornography addiction are without classification in the [[ICD-11]].

'''Problematic Internet pornography viewing''' is viewing of [[Internet pornography]] that is problematic for an individual due to personal or social reasons, including excessive time spent viewing pornography instead of interacting with others. Individuals may report [[depression (mood)|depression]], social [[Solitude|isolation]], career loss, decreased productivity, or financial consequences as a result of their excessive internet pornography viewing impeding on their social life.&lt;ref name="twohig2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Twohig | first1 = M.

==Symptoms and diagnosis==
{{See also|Effects of pornography}}

Universally accepted [[diagnostic criteria]] do not exist for pornography addiction or problematic pornography viewing.&lt;ref name="twohig2010"/&gt; Pornography addiction is often defined operationally by the frequency of pornography viewing and negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duffy|first1=A|last2=Dawson|first2=DL|last3=das Nair|first3=R|title=Pornography Addiction in Adults: A Systematic Review of Definitions and Reported Impact.|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|date=May 2016|volume=13|issue=5|pages=760–77|doi=10.1016/j.jsxm.2016.03.002|pmid=27114191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only diagnostic criteria for a [[behavioral addiction]] in the current ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' are for [[pathological gambling]], and they are similar to those for [[substance abuse]] and [[substance dependence|dependence]], such as preoccupation with the behavior, diminished ability to control the behavior, [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], and adverse [[psychosocial]] consequences. Diagnostic criteria have been proposed for other behavioral addictions, and these are usually also based on established diagnoses for substance abuse and dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grant | first1 = J. E. | last2 = Potenza | first2 = M. N. | last3 = Weinstein | first3 = A. | last4 = Gorelick | first4 = D.

A proposed diagnosis for [[hypersexual disorder]] includes pornography as a subtype of this disorder. It included such criteria as time consumed by sexual activity interfering with obligations, repetitive engagement in sexual activity in response to stress, repeated failed attempts to reduce these behaviors, and distress or impairment of life functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kafka | first1 = M. P. | title = Hypersexual Disorder: A Proposed Diagnosis for DSM-V | doi = 10.1007/s10508-009-9574-7 | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 377–400 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19937105| pmc = | url = http://dsm5.org/Research/Documents/Kafka_Hypersexual_ASB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study on problematic Internet pornography viewing used the criteria of viewing Internet pornography more than three times a week during some weeks, and viewing causing difficulty in general life functioning.&lt;ref name="twohig2010"/&gt;

According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, some psychological and behavioral changes characteristic of addiction brain changes include addictive cravings, impulsiveness, weakened executive function, desensitization, and dysphoria,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asam.org/quality-practice/definition-of-addiction|title=ASAM Definition of Addiction|last=|first=|date=19 April 2011|website=|publisher=|access-date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is evidence that such changes can occur in internet porn addicts.&lt;ref name="Kraus 385–386"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraus|first=Shane W|last2=Voon|first2=Valerie|last3=Potenza|first3=Marc N|date=2015-09-22|title=Neurobiology of Compulsive Sexual Behavior: Emerging Science|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282090679_Neurobiology_of_Compulsive_Sexual_Behavior_Emerging_Science|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|volume=41|issue=1|pages=385–386|doi=10.1038/npp.2015.300|issn=0893-133X|pmc=4677151|pmid=26657963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chatzittofis|first=Andreas|last2=Arver|first2=Stefan|last3=Öberg|first3=Katarina|last4=Hallberg|first4=Jonas|last5=Nordström|first5=Peter|last6=Jokinen|first6=Jussi|date=2016-01-01|title=HPA axis dysregulation in men with hypersexual disorder|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|volume=63|pages=247–253|doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.10.002|issn=1873-3360|pmid=26519779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diagnostic status===
The status of pornography addiction as an addictive disorder, rather than simply a [[compulsivity]], has been hotly contested.&lt;ref name=Steeleetal2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steele |first1=V. |last2=Prause |first2=N. |last3=Staley |first3=C. |last4=Fong |first4=G. W. |title= Sexual Desire, not Hypersexuality, is Related to Neurophysiological Responses Elicited by Sexual Images|journal=Socioaffective Neuroscience of Psychology |volume=3 |pages= 20770|year=2013 |doi= 10.3402/snp.v3i0.20770}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{medrs|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilton|first1=Donald L.|title=‘High desire’, or ‘merely’ an addiction?

In November 2016, the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT) issued a position statement on sex/porn addiction which states that AASECT "does not find sufficient empirical evidence to support the classification of sex addiction or porn addiction as a mental health disorder, and does not find the sexual addiction training and treatment methods and educational pedagogies to be adequately informed by accurate human sexuality knowledge. Therefore, it is the position of AASECT that linking problems related to sexual urges, thoughts or behaviors to a porn/sexual addiction process cannot be advanced by AASECT as a standard of practice for sexuality education delivery, counseling or therapy."

The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]) includes a new section for behavioral addictions, but includes only one disorder: [[pathological gambling]].&lt;ref name="dsm-5"&gt;{{Cite book|first=|last=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders| edition=Fifth|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Arlington, VA|pages=481, 797–798|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|quote=In addition to the substance-related disorders, this chapter also includes gambling disorder, reflecting evidence that gambling behaviors activate reward systems similar to those activated by drugs of abuse and produce some behavioral symptoms that appear comparable to those produced by the substance use disorders. Other excessive behavioral patterns, such as Internet gaming, have also been described, but the research on these and other behavioral syndromes is less clear. Thus, groups of repetitive behaviors, which some term behavioral addictions, with such subcategories as "sex addiction," "exercise addiction," or "shopping addiction," are not included because at this time there is insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders. ... Excessive use of the Internet not involving playing of online games (e.g., excessive use of social media, such as Facebook; viewing pornography online) is not considered analogous to Internet gaming disorder, and future research on other excessive uses of the Internet would need to follow similar guidelines as suggested herein. Excessive gambling online may qualify for a separate diagnosis of gambling disorder.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One other behavioral addiction, internet gaming disorder, appears in the conditions proposed for further study in DSM-5.&lt;ref name="dsm-5" /&gt; Psychiatrists cited a lack of research support for refusing to include other behavioral disorders at this time.&lt;ref name="dsm-5" /&gt;

Porn addiction is not a diagnosis in DSM-5 (or any previous version).&lt;ref name=weir&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weir|first1=Kirsten|authorlink1= |title=Is pornography addictive? |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/04/pornography.aspx|deadurl=yes|format= |department= |journal=Monitor on Psychology|type= |series= |language= |edition= |location=Washington, D.C.|publisher= |publication-date=April 2014|volume=45|issue=4|page=46 |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |isbn= |issn=1529-4978|jfm= |jstor= |lccn=  |oclc=612512821 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405232028/http://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/04/pornography.aspx|archivedate=2014-04-05|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="allez"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Glyn Hudson Allez|title=Sexual Diversity and Sexual Offending: Research, Assessment, and Clinical Treatment in Psychosexual Therapy|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MXnAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=pornography+addiction+%22dsm-5%22|date=4 June 2014|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=978-1-78181-368-3|page=161|chapter=Chapter Ten.

The International Classification of Disorders 11 (ICD-11) rejected "pornography addiction". Specifically, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) wrote: "Based on the limited current data, it would therefore seem premature to include [pornography viewing] in ICD-11."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=J.|year=2014|title=Impulse control disorders and "behavioural addictions" in the ICD‐11|journal=World Psychiatry|volume=13|pages=125–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
[[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] has been suggested as a possible effective treatment for pornography addiction based on its success with [[internet addict]]s, though no clinical trials have been performed to assess effectiveness among pornography addicts as of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Laier, Christian.

Some clinicians and support organizations recommend voluntary use of Internet [[content-control software]], [[Internet surveillance|internet monitoring]], or both, to manage online pornography use.&lt;ref name="cooper1999"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10720169908400182 |title=Online sexual compulsivity: Getting tangled in the net |year=1999 |last1=Cooper |first1=Alvin |last2=Putnam |first2=Dana E. |last3=Planchon |first3=Lynn A. |last4=Boies |first4=Sylvain C. |journal=Sexual Addiction &amp; Compulsivity |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=79–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="delmonico1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10720169708400139 |title=Cybersex: High tech sex addiction |year=1997 |last1=Delmonico |first1=David L. |journal=Sexual Addiction &amp; Compulsivity |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=159–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="layden2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Layden, Mary Anne | date=September 2005 | title=Cyber Sex Addiction | journal=Advances in Cognitive Therapy | pages=1–2, 4–5 | url=http://www.academyofct.org/Library/InfoManage/Guide.asp?FolderID=295&amp;SessionID= | format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex researcher Alvin Cooper and colleagues suggested several reasons for using filters as a therapeutic measure, including curbing accessibility that facilitates problematic behavior and encouraging clients to develop coping and relapse prevention strategies.&lt;ref name=cooper1999/&gt; Cognitive therapist Mary Anne Layden suggested that filters may be useful in maintaining environmental control.&lt;ref name=layden2005/&gt; Internet behavior researcher David Delmonico stated that, despite their limitations, filters may serve as a "frontline of protection."&lt;ref name=delmonico1997/&gt;

===Medications===
{{see also|Behavioral addiction#Treatment}}
Studies of those with non-paraphilic expressions of hypersexuality have hypothesized that various mood disorders, as defined in the DSM, may occur more frequently in sexually compulsive men.&lt;ref&gt;Kafka, M.P., &amp; Hennen, J. (2002). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martin_Kafka/publication/11083585_A_DSM-IV_Axis_I_Comorbidity_Study_of_Males_n_120_with_Paraphilias_and_Paraphilia-Related_Disorders/links/5510484e0cf2ba84483d458c.pdf A DSM IV axis I comorbidity study of males (n¼120) with paraphilias and paraphilia-related disorders].

==Epidemiology==
There is only one representative sample to date concerning distress about sex video use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Rissel|first1= C |last2=Richters|first2=J.|last3=de Visser|first3=R.|last4= McKee|first4=A.|last5=Yeung|first5=A.|year=2017|title=A profile of pornography users in australia: Findings from the second australian study of health and relationships.|journal=he journal of sex research|volume=54|pages=227–240|doi=10.1080/00224499.2016.1191597}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that of 10,131 women surveyed, 0.5% of women agreed with the statement that they were "addicted" to pornography; 1.2% (of 4,218 who viewed) when limited to women who say they viewed sex films. The comparable figure limiting to men who view sex films was 4.4%. This was without any clinical screening that should eliminate primary disorders (e.g., depression) or religious-based concerns, so these should be considered high-end estimates for potential disorders, if any exist.

Most studies of rates use a [[convenience sample]]. One study of a convenience sample of 9,265 people found that 1% of Internet users have concerns about their Internet use and 17% of users meet criteria for problematic [[sexual compulsivity]], meaning they score above one [[standard deviation]] of the mean on the Kalichman [[Sexual Compulsivity Scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cooper A. |author2=Delmonico D.

===Political and religious motivation===

According to E.T.M. Laan, a sexologist working for the [[Academic Medical Center]], it is usually the [[Christian right|religious right]] which claims the existence of pornography addiction and such claims are rare among sexologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Casper van der Veen|title = ‘Erectieproblemen bij jongeren door porno op internet’ - NRC|url = https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/08/17/erectieproblemen-bij-jongeren-door-porno-op-internet-3826489-a1516755|accessdate=20 September 2016|date=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29000">'''Precycling''' is the practice of [[waste reduction|reducing waste]] by attempting to avoid bringing items which will generate [[waste]] into home or business. The U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) also cites that precycling is the preferred method of integrated [[solid waste management]] because it cuts waste at its source and therefore trash is eliminated before it is created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|pages=1382–1390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillian|first1=Sheryl|last2=Werner|first2=Carol M.|last3=Olson|first3=Lynne|last4=Adams|first4=Dorothy|title=Teaching the concept of precycling: a campaign and evaluation.|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|date=1996|volume=28|issue=1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the EPA, precycling is also characterized as a decision-making process on the behalf of the consumer because it involves making informed judgments regarding a product’s waste implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Leary|first1=Philip R|last2=Walsh|first2=Patrick W|title=Source Reduction: Final Report|journal=Decision Maker's Guide to Solid Waste Management|date=1999|volume=2|page=5|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/dmg2/chapter5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implications that are taken into consideration by the consumer include: whether a product is [[Reuse|reusable]], [[durable]], or [[repairable]]; made from renewable or [[non-renewable resource]]s; [[over-packaged]]; and whether or not the container is reusable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Leary|first1=Philip R|last2=Walsh|first2=Patrick W|title=Source Reduction: Final Report|journal=Decision Maker's Guide to Solid Waste Management|date=1999|volume=2|page=6|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/dmg2/chapter5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
Precycling has the ability to build industrial, social, environmental, and economic circumstances that allow for old products to be converted into new resources &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1385}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Industrial: increasing the independence from accumulative substances, such as heavy metals, fossil fuels, synthetics, etc.
*Economic: create a [[circular economy]]
*Ecological/environmental: allowance for more extensive and diverse [[natural habitat]]s where the resources are returned to nature
*Societal: extend the capacity of precycling to meet everyone’s needs
The concept of ‘precycling’ was coined in 1988 by [[social marketing]] executive Maureen O’Rorke in a public waste education campaign for the City of Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=DiChristina|first1=Mariette|title=How We Can Win The War Against Garbage|magazine=Popular Science|year=1990|volume=237|issue=4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The application of precycling is not limited to large corporations, but can be administered on smaller scales in local communities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The reason precycling is effective on large scales and on small scales stems from the idea that it shares a common language between experts and non-experts, buyers and sellers, economists and environmentalists.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, it is important to consider that waste prevention systems, such as precycling, require the collaborative effort from several working parts.  These parts include prevention targets, producer responsibility, householder charging, funding for pilot projects, public involvement, engagement of private and third sectors, and public campaigns that spread awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|pages=193–219|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration of waste management==
The original three-pronged push for [[waste management]] is "[[Reduce, Reuse, Recycle]]." Precycling emphasizes "reducing and reusing", while harnessing and questioning the momentum and popularity of the term "recycle." In addition to this strategy, precycling incorporates four supplementary R’s: [[Repair]], Recondition, [[Remanufacturing|Remanufacture]] and Refuse.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|pages=257–267|url= http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/5495/ |doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste is a resource that can be reused, recycled, recovered, or treated.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey K 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1646|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precycling differs from other singular forms of waste prevention because it encompasses not one behavior, but many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=212|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reduce===
Reduce is a form of precycling that allows for the preservation of [[natural resources]] and also saves money on behalf of the manufacturer, the consumer, and the waste manager.&lt;ref name="Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Marie|last2=Papadi|first2=Joan|last3=Gutter|first3=Michael|title=Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter|date=2007|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, effective source reduction slows the [[resource depletion|depletion of environmental resources]], prolongs the life of waste management facilities, and makes combustion and [[landfill]]s safer by removing [[toxic waste]] components.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Reuse===
[[Reuse]] is a form of precycling that reinvents items after their initial life and avoids creating additional waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bushnell|first1=Kristen|last2=Harpster|first2=Amy|last3=Simchuk|first3=Sarah|last4=Manckia|first4=Jen|last5=Stevens|first5=Cathy|title=Reduce, Reuse, Recycle|date=2009|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although precycling harnesses the familiarity of the term recycling, it is still important to note the difference between recycling and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=195|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since precycling focuses on the prevention of waste production, this entails that measures are taken before a substance, material, or product has become waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=195|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas recycling is a type of precycling that involves taking action before existing waste is abandoned to nature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Recycling is a process where discarded materials are collected, sorted, processed, and used in the production of new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=263|url=http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/5495/|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every time a person engages in the act of recycling, they help increase the market and bring the cost down.&lt;ref name="Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter"/&gt; However, current research from the American Plastics Council states that only 25% of the nation’s recycling capabilities are being utilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krug|first1=Donna|last2=County Agency|first2=Barton|title=It's Easy to be Green|date=2009|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally [[recycling]] requires large amounts of energy to "melt down" and then re-manufacture items. While this may cut down on the amount of trash that is going into [[landfill]]s, it is not sustainable unless the underlying energy supply is sustainable. In addition, recycling often means [[downcycling]] and always involves at least some loss of the original material, so primary extraction is still required to make up the difference. Precycling reduces these problems by using less material in the first place, so less has to be recycled.

===Repairing===
[[Repair]] is a type of precycling that corrects specified faults in a product, however the quality of a repaired product is inferior to reconditioned or remanufactured items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=260|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; One survey found that 68% of the respondents believed repairing was not cost efficient and sought alternative methods such as reconditioning or remanufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=260|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconditioning===
[[Reconditioning]] is a type of precycling that requires the rebuilding of major components to restore a product’s working condition, which is expected to be inferior to the original product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remanufacturing===
[[Remanufacturing]] is another type of precycling that involves the greatest degree of work content, which results in superior quality of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to remanufacture a product, it requires a total dismantling of the product and the subsequent restoration and replacement of its parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remanufacturing is a preferred method of waste reduction compared to repairing and reconditioning because it preserves the [[embodied energy]] that has been used to shape the components of a product for their first life and it only requires 20-25% of the initial energy used in formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refuse===
Refusal to buy certain products due to detrimental impacts on the environment or wasteful packaging is another type of precycling because the rejection of such items paves the way for products that can be reduced, reused, or recycled.&lt;ref name="Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter"/&gt;

==Zero-waste strategy==
A [[zero waste]] approach aims to prevent rather than just reduce accumulated waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garbage &amp; Recycling"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curbside Cleanup|first1=Day|title=Garbage &amp; Recycling|journal=Earth 7|date=2012|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zero-waste goes beyond recycling to include the whole system, which includes the flow of resources and waste through human society.&lt;ref name="Garbage &amp; Recycling"/&gt; This “design principle” works to maximize recycling, minimize waste, reduce consumption and ensures that products are reused, repaired or recycled back into nature or the market.&lt;ref name="Garbage &amp; Recycling"/&gt; This preventative approach is more manageable and effective than incremental approaches that focus on gradually reducing the amount of impact because it is less complex and contains less information, which permits wider public participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
In regards to sustainability, the term itself is often associated with resource constraints and maintenance of the status quo rather than growth and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1649|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the implementation of a zero-waste management strategy, sustainable practices can push the status quo in order to create a society that is capable of development, technically and culturally advanced, dynamic in population and production, thoughtful with the use of non-renewable resources, and diverse, democratic, and challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1649|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic effects===
Increased waste production is often negatively associated with increased [[economic growth]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; However, a zero-waste management strategy allows for economic growth that works cohesively with sustainability rather than against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1383}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of a zero-waste strategy is part of an economic goal-set that aims to create a circular economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1383}}&lt;/ref&gt; A circular economy refers to a closed-loop socio-economic system that focuses on minimizing wastes while simultaneously maximizing stocks of resources for the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1384}}&lt;/ref&gt; This closed-loop design diverts linear (open-loop) waste disposal streams into new raw material streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=259|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a circular economy, one way to minimize waste is through the employment of precycling insurance, which allows for a full range of financed waste prevention opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of insurance would set premiums related to the risk of a product ending up as waste, and these premiums would serve to fund actions concerning waste prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; When establishing a premium for precycling insurance several factors need to calculated: recyclability or biodegradability; provision of infrastructure, habitat or collaborations for the generation of the product from new resources; the ecosystem concentrations of product components above natural levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of precycling insurance is plausible considering the aim of insurance industries is to avoid losses rather than paying for losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order for this idea to work, private and third sectors need to be involved and engaged in the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance, a third sector refers to small charities and a handful of societal enterprises that coordinate with charity shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=204|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental effects===
According to the “Extended Producer Responsibility” principle,  impacts are substantially determined at the point of design where key decisions are made on materials, production process, and how products are used and disposed of at the end of life-cycle, which falls on the producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=258|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a circular economy there is the recognition that nature’s capacity needs to be maximized through the reprocess of biodegradable wastes produced by industries and human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task is accomplished through the procurement and funding of precycling insurance premiums that invest in systematic preservation of endangered habitats, careful harvesting of biological resources and expansions of productive ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in terms of climate change, precycling insurance offers a flexible alternative to the binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions and international taxation on mineral fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1388}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[waste management]] systems, the environment benefits from the reparation of products to the greatest degree because less energy is required and the majority of the original material is kept intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=265|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Societal effects===
The social structure operating under a circular economy is referred to as a circular society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of a circular society is to create a cooperative culture by means of problem-prevention, resource-availability and fuller participation, with reference to precycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1388}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One critique of this approach, in terms of waste management, is that it is difficult to maintain a cooperative culture within a society because it is constantly evolving and changing.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey K 2010"/&gt;

==Raising awareness==
There is an increasing [[public awareness]] on the need for [[sustainable production]] and consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopewell|first1=Jefferson|last2=Dvorak|first2=Robert|last3=Kosior|first3=Edward|title=Plastics recycling: challenges and opportunities|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2009|volume=364|issue=1526|page=2124|doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0311|pmid=19528059|pmc=2873020}}&lt;/ref&gt; One campaign that aimed at raising awareness of precycling focused on whether people’s self-reported behaviors were affected by exposure to precycling advertisements on the radio, television, or in-store flyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillian|first1=Sheryl|last2=Werner|first2=Carol M.|last3=Olson|first3=Lynne|last4=Adams|first4=Dorothy|title=Teaching the concept of precycling: a campaign and evaluation.|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|date=1996|volume=28|issue=1|page=12|doi=10.1080/00958964.1996.9942810}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers concluded that the most effective results stemmed from the inclusion of social rewards that invoke an intrinsic motivation to engage in precycling behaviors.&lt;ref name=gillian&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillian|first1=Sheryl|last2=Werner|first2=Carol M.|last3=Olson|first3=Lynne|last4=Adams|first4=Dorothy|title=Teaching the concept of precycling: a campaign and evaluation.|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|date=1996|volume=28|issue=1|page=16|doi=10.1080/00958964.1996.9942810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to raise awareness is through statistics that highlight the potential impacts that can be achieved through waste prevention. For instance, if 70 million Americans bought a half-gallon [[plastic-coated carton]] container of milk each week (instead of two quarts), then 41.6 million pounds of paper discards and 5.7 pounds of plastic discards would be reduced annually.  This transition from two quarts to a half-gallon would save $145.6 million on packaging each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Marie|last2=Papadi|first2=Joan|last3=Gutter|first3=Michael|title=Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter|date=2007|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
In order to effectively implement precycling practices and behaviors, the public needs to feel "enabled", "engaged", "encouraged", and "exemplified" in their efforts to partake in precycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=196|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only can the average consumer practice precycling, but industries can also participate. Purchasing from parts suppliers, reuse of chemicals, and reduction of unnecessary packaging are some methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Precycling|work=Environmental Encyclopedia|publisher=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some companies and countries that have taken it upon themselves to implement more sustainable practices that align with precycling principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1647|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Fonterra]] reduced its packaging through the implementation of bulking, reuse and redesign.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey K 2010"/&gt; Further, [[Waste in New Zealand|Waste Management New Zealand]] created Recycle New Zealand, which provided a subsidiary focusing on the collection of materials that could be diverted and sorted prior to the operations of reducing, recycling, or recovering.  Moving forward, free-trade organizations can further implement precycling practices by exploring this strategy as a new way to reduce regulations and to promote greater industrial freedom of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the individual consumer can develop precycling habits by engaging in the following practices and behaviors:

==="Enviro-shopping"===
Enviro-shopping is considered shopping with the environment and implements a precycling strategy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Marie|last2=Papadi|first2=Joan|last3=Gutter|first3=Michael|title=Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter|date=2007|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Bringing one's own grocery bag or bring old ones back to the store 
*Buying packages with the least amount of packaging 
*Buying in bulk, but not buying more than one will use
*Looking for products with reusable dishes

===Product selection===
Products to choose from in accordance with precycling principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curbside Cleanup|first1=Day|title=Garbage &amp; Recycling|journal=Earth 7|date=2012|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Plastic milk jugs or glass milk containers (no cartons)
*Fresh fruit and vegetables
*Concentrated products that involves less packaging
*Recycled products
*[[Rechargeable battery|Rechargeable batteries]]

===Behaviors===
In addition to shopping practices that implement precycling principles, there are also behaviors that can be undertaken to prevent waste:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=200|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Home [[compost]]ing
*Avoid [[Advertising mail|junk mail]]
*Buy [[used good|second-hand]]
*One way to participate in precycling is to carry a "precycling kit". Include a [[Tupperware]] or non-[[disposable]] container, [[silver (household)|silverware]] set, a [[napkin|cloth napkin]] or [[handkerchief]], and a [[thermos]] or water-bottle within a [[cloth]] bag that can double as a [[grocery bag|grocery/shopping bag]].

'''Serosorting''', also known as "serodiscrimination", is the practice of using HIV status as a decision-making point in choosing [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]]. Frequently the term is used to describe the behavior of a person who chooses a sexual partner assumed to be of the same HIV [[serostatus]] in order to engage in [[Safe sex|unprotected sex]] with them for a reduced risk of acquiring or transmitting [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/research/resources/other/serosorting.htm |title=Meeting Summary: "Consultation on Serosorting Practices among Men who Have Sex with Men" |date=31 March 2009 |work=cdc.gov |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge of [[HIV status]] is based on the result of a person's [[HIV test]], with a positive result indicating that a person has HIV, and can potentially transmit the disease to others during any sexual contact involving an exchange of bodily fluids (e.g., unprotected anal or vaginal sex). There are many situations where determining their partner's serostatus outside of clinical settings cannot be done ''with complete certainty'', limiting the efficacy in mitigating the transmission of [[HIV/AIDS]] (or other [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]]). As people do not typically engage in sex practices with the expectation of contracting or transmitting HIV, failed attempts at serosorting are a leading cause of the contraction of HIV among partners.

==Terms and etymology==
The word '''''serosorting''''' comes from the Latin word ''serum'', which refers to [[blood serum]]. Sorting refers to choosing partners based on HIV status, which can be determined from blood tests, among other methods. '''[[Serodiscordant]] sex''' refers to sex between an HIV-positive person and an HIV-negative person; typically partners practicing serosorting make an attempt to find someone with a matching HIV test result, otherwise known as a '''seroconcordant''' partner.

==Risks associated with serosorting==

===Failure to accurately determine HIV status===
Failure to accurately determine HIV status may stem from people not being sure of their true HIV status (or not admitting to having [[HIV]])—even a recent negative result from an [[HIV test]] may not be definitive of a person's serostatus, because if they are still within the [[window period]] following a recent infection, the [[antibodies]] that the blood tests measure will not be present yet. In addition, testing negative for [[HIV]] does not guarantee that they are free of other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs) such as [[Human Papillomavirus|HPV]] or [[hepatitis B]].

However, the largest experiment with serosorting has been conducted in the [[adult film]] industry by the Adult Industry Medical Healthcare Foundation. The Adult Industry Medical testing program, or AIM, eliminates virtually all possibility of lying{{how|date=November 2013}} and enforces a high frequency of testing for a variety of STDs that can make the transmission of [[HIV]] more likely. All actors in legitimate adult films are tested twice a year for [[herpes]], [[gonorrhea]], [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[syphilis]], hepatitis types [[Hepatitis A|A]],&amp;nbsp;[[Hepatitis B|B]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Hepatitis C|C]], and HIV—as well as monthly for HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Before this program of testing, adult film actors had a very high rate of STDs, but now have only a 20% higher rate of STDs than the general public.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===As a substitution for condom use===
Dr. Matthew Golden of King County Public Health, in Washington, conducted a study with sexually active West Coast men and concluded that the patient population did demonstrate limited protection from HIV by serosorting. In his study, 3.5% of the men that used neither condoms nor serosorting became HIV-positive, as compared to 2.6% of the men that practiced serosorting alone, and 1.5% of the men who reported consistent [[condom]] use without serosorting.

Golden's population differs from AIM's in that [[anal sex]] made up a high proportion of the subjects' sexual habits, their testing intervals were typically longer and less regular, there were no tests for STDs other than HIV, such as [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] (an important factor considering other STDs may hasten the spread of the virus), and there were no protections against falsely reporting any of the results. Golden's study did not cover the use of serosorting combined with [[condoms]]—which, theoretically, would be more effective than either precaution used separately.&lt;ref name="Goldenstudy"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Golden, MR |author2=Stekler, J |author3=Hughes, JP |author4=Wood, RW |year=2008 |title=HIV serosorting in men who have sex with men: is it safe? |journal=[[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]] |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=212–8 |doi=10.1097/QAI.0b013e31818455e8 |pmid=18769346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease exchange between seroconcordant people===
Serosorting does not fully protect against all STDs during [[unprotected sex]] between two people infected with HIV. Infection with ''one'' strain of HIV does not preclude later infection with ''another'' strain. There is a great deal of genetic variability within individual HIV populations, because this variability is shuffled and [[mutated]] every time the virus (numbering in the millions) reproduces inside the infected person's body. Modern drug cocktails keep virus and mutation levels low but eventually [[drug resistance]] will develop. Unprotected sex between two individuals positive for HIV still presents the risk of one of them—with a relatively less aggressive strain of the virus—exchanging genetic sequences with their partner's more drug-resistant cousin, and becoming harder to treat.&lt;ref name='pmid 16052079'&gt;{{cite journal

==Motivation for serosorting==

===Lower rates of changing each other's serostatus===
Studies have shown that serosorting provides some limited decrease in risk of contracting [[HIV]] among [[Men who have sex with men]] (MSMs) who use it as an HIV risk reduction technique.&lt;ref name="Goldenstudy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/Abstract/2005/04001/Sexual_harm_reduction_practices_of.2.aspx | title=Sexual harm reduction practices of HIV-seropositive gay and bisexual men: serosorting, strategic positioning, and withdrawal before ejaculation | publisher=[[AIDS (journal)|AIDS]] |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=S13–S25 | date=April 2005 | accessdate=2010-12-23 |author1=Parsons, Jeffrey T |author2=Schrimshaw, Eric W |author3=Wolitski, Richard J |author4=Halkitis, Perry N |author5=Purcell, David W |author6=Hoff, Colleen C |author7=Gómez, Cynthia A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aidsmap.com/en/news/E198EB3E-2EE3-48D6-BAC2-0C5EF17CE24A.asp |title=Is serosorting working, or even possible? |author=Gus Cairns |date=22 August 2006 |accessdate=2008-06-02 |publisher=[[aidsmap]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been seen as controversial in being used to engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] without regard to [[safer sex]] practices, as either participants were free of HIV or were already [[asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]s. Although the practice has occurred informally since the [[AIDS pandemic]] began,&lt;ref name="serosortingintro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art40765.html | title=Serosorting | publisher=[[San Francisco AIDS Foundation]] | date=Winter 2007 | accessdate=2010-12-23 |author1=Siconolfi, Daniel E |author2=Moeller, Robert W }}&lt;/ref&gt; serosorting has become more prevalent with online [[social networking]] sites now facilitating interactions, and even some health professionals citing [[harm reduction]] concepts for [[gay]] men as a measure to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Race |first=Kane |year=2010 |title=Click Here for HIV Status: Shifting Templates of Sexual Negotiation |journal=Emotion Space &amp; Society |pages=7–14 |volume=3 |issue=1 |doi=10.1016/j.emospa.2010.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New developments===
There has been further evolution on the idea of serosorting since the introduction of home-based rapid result tests. Prior to engaging in unprotected sex the two partners get tested together. If the immediate results are concordant they choose to have unprotected sex; while if the result is discordant condoms are used.

===The appeal of bareback sex===
'''[[Bareback (sex)|Barebacking]]''', or having male-to-male anal sex without using a [[condom]], first became articulated in magazines such as [[POZ (magazine)|POZ]] in 1995–96 as a practice taking place among HIV-positive men, and may be seen as an early articulation of serosorting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Race |first=Kane |year=2010 |title=Engaging in a Culture of Barebacking: Gay Men and the Risk of HIV Prevention |journal=HIV Treatment and Prevention Technologies in International Perspective |isbn=978-0-230-23819-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual identity therapy''' ('''SIT''') is a framework to "aid [[mental health]] practitioners in helping people arrive at a healthy and personally acceptable resolution of [[sexual orientation identity|sexual identity]] and value conflicts."&lt;ref name="framework" /&gt;  It was invented by [[Warren Throckmorton]] and Mark Yarhouse, professors at small conservative evangelical colleges.

Its purpose is to help clients align their sexual identity with their beliefs and values, which in some cases means celibacy, if chosen by the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At any point during the therapy, a previous step may be revisited for further investigation or to explore a new direction in the therapy.&lt;ref name=framework /&gt;

=== Assessment ===
The first step is to discover the reasoning of a client requesting therapy. Clinicians should determine whether the motivation is internal or external, followed by an open dialogue about motivations while respecting the client's world view.  They should assist the client to clarify their
values in order to determine their preferred course of action.  This must be individualized.&lt;ref name=framework&gt;[http://wthrockmorton.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/sexualidentitytherapyframeworkfinal.pdf Sexual Identity Therapy Framework] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703154018/http://wthrockmorton.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/sexualidentitytherapyframeworkfinal.pdf |date=2008-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advanced informed consent ===
Clinicians should stay up to date on literature concerning the causes of homosexuality, but if the client asks about it, they should see how that would affect their course of action.&lt;ref name=framework /&gt;

=== Psychotherapy ===
Sexual Identity Therapy gives a framework for existing techniques rather than a specific method of psychotherapy. If a therapist's value position is in conflict with the client's preferred direction, a referral to a more suitable mental health professional may be indicated. The goal of therapy is to help the person explore and eventually live more comfortably within a sexual identity that is consistent with personal values and beliefs. This may not be quick or complete, and the client should feel free to pursue other directions.&lt;ref name=framework /&gt;

=== Sexual identity synthesis ===
As clients synthesize a new identity, the therapist should make them aware of the consequences. Therapeutic interventions can be employed to assist clients pursue valued behavior while avoiding unvalued behavior. While the decision is the clients, clients are advised against sexual behavior until they are comfortable with their new identity. Many clients find it helpful to attend support groups and avoid social situations that do not support the new identity.&lt;ref name=framework /&gt;

'''Stochastic Petri nets''' are a form of [[Petri net]] where the transitions fire after a probabilistic delay determined by a [[random variable]].  

==Definition==
A ''stochastic Petri net'' is a five-tuple ''SPN'' = (''P'', ''T'', ''F'', ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Λ'') where:
# ''P'' is a set of states, called ''places''.
# ''T'' is a set of ''transitions''.
# ''F'' where ''F'' &lt;big&gt;⊂&lt;/big&gt; (''P'' × ''T'') &lt;big&gt;∪&lt;/big&gt; (''T'' × ''P'') is a set of flow relations called "arcs" between places and transitions (and between transitions and places).
# ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''initial marking''.
# ''Λ = '' is the array of ''firing rates λ'' associated with the transitions. The firing rate, a [[random variable]], can also be a function λ(''M'') of the current marking.

==Correspondence to Markov process==
The [[reachability]] graph of stochastic Petri nets can be mapped directly to a [[Markov process]]. It satisfies the [[Markov property]], since its states depend only on the current marking. 
Each state in the reachability graph is mapped to a state in the Markov process, and the firing of a transition with firing rate λ corresponds to a Markov state transition with probability λ.

'''Thermofluids'''&lt;ref&gt;http://mech.ubc.ca/undergraduate-students/thermofluids/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imeche.org/knowledge/industries/thermofluids&lt;/ref&gt; is a branch of science and engineering encompassing four intersecting fields:
*[[Heat transfer]]
*[[Thermodynamics]]
*[[Fluid mechanics]]
*[[Combustion]]

The term is a combination of "thermo", referring to heat, and "fluids", which refers to [[liquid]]s, [[gas]]es and [[vapor]]s. [[Temperature]], [[pressure]], equations of state, and transport laws all play an important role in thermofluid problems.  [[Phase transition]] and [[chemical reactions]] may also be important in a thermofluid context.  The subject is sometimes also referred to as "thermal fluids".

==Heat Transfer==
[[Heat transfer]] is a discipline of [[thermal engineering]] that concerns the transfer of [[thermal energy]] from one physical system to another. Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as [[heat conduction]], [[convection]], [[thermal radiation]], and phase-change transfer. Engineers also consider the transfer of mass of differing chemical species, either cold or hot, to achieve heat transfer.  

Sections include :
*[[Energy transfer]] by heat, work and mass
*[[Laws of thermodynamics]]
*[[Entropy]]
*[[Refrigeration]] Techniques
*Properties and nature of pure substances

===Applications===
*Engineering : Predicting and analysing the performance of machines

==Thermodynamics==
[[Thermodynamics]] is the science of [[energy]] conversion involving heat and other forms of energy, most notably [[mechanical work]]. It studies and interrelates the [[macroscopic]] variables, such as [[temperature]], [[volume]] and [[pressure]], which describe physical, thermodynamic systems.

==Fluid Mechanics==
[[Fluid Mechanics]] the study of the physical forces at work during fluid flow. Fluid mechanics can be divided into fluid [[kinematics]], the study of fluid motion, and [[fluid dynamics]], the study of the effect of forces on fluid motion, which can further be divided into fluid statics, the study of fluids at rest, and fluid kinetics, the study of fluids in motion. Some of its more interesting concepts include [[momentum]] and reactive forces in fluid flow and fluid machinery theory and performance.

Sections include:
*[[Fluid flow]] and continuity
*[[Momentum]] in fluids
*Static and dynamic forces on a boundary
*[[Laminar flow|Laminar]] and turbulent flow
*Metacentric height and vessel stability

===Applications===
*Pump Design.
*Hydro-Electric Power Generation.
*Naval Architecture.

==Combustion==
[[Combustion]] is the sequence of [[exothermic]] chemical reactions between a [[fuel]] and an [[oxidant]] accompanied by the production of [[heat]] and conversion of chemical species. The release of heat can result in the production of light  in the form of either glowing or a [[flame]]. Fuels of interest often include organic compounds (especially [[hydrocarbons]]) in the gas, liquid or solid phase.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9590">[[File:Flock of birds at Rome.ogg|right|300px|thumb|Although this flock is made of the same ''type'' of bird, each individual bird is a different ''token''. (50 MB video of a [[Flock (birds)|flock of birds]] in Rome)|thumbtime=6]]
The '''type–token distinction''' is used in disciplines such as [[logic]], [[linguistics]], [[metalogic]], [[typography]], and [[computer programming]] to clarify what words mean.

==Overview==
The sentence "''they drive the same car''" is ambiguous. Do they drive the same ''type'' of car (the same model) or the same instance of a car type (a single vehicle)? Clarity requires us to distinguish words that represent abstract types from words that represent objects that embody or exemplify types. The type–token distinction separates types (abstract descriptive concepts) from tokens (objects that instantiate concepts).

For example: "bicycle" represents a type: the concept of a bicycle; whereas "my bicycle" represents a token of that type: an object that instantiates that type. In the sentence "the bicycle is becoming more popular" the word "bicycle" represents a type that is a concept; whereas in the sentence "the bicycle is in the garage" the word "bicycle" represents a token: a particular object.

(The distinction in [[computer programming]] between [[class (software)|classes]] and [[object (computer science)|objects]] is related, though in this context, "class" sometimes refers to a set of objects (with class-level attribute or operations) rather than a description of an object in the set, as "type" would.)

The words type, concept, property, quality, feature and attribute (all used in describing things) tend to be used with different verbs. E.g. Suppose a rose bush is defined as a plant that is "thorny", "flowering" and "bushy". You might say a rose bush ''instantiates'' these three types, or ''embodies'' these three concepts, or ''exhibits'' these three properties, or ''possesses'' these three qualities, features or attributes.

Property types (e.g "height in metres" or "thorny") are often understood [[ontology|ontologically]] as concepts. Property instances (e.g. height = 1.74) are sometimes understood as measured values, and sometimes understood as sensations or observations of reality.

Some say types exist in descriptions of objects, but not as tangible [[physical object]]s. They say one can show someone a particular bicycle, but cannot show someone the type "bicycle", as in "''the bicycle'' is popular.". However types do exist in the sense that they appear in mental and documented models.

Some say tokens are objects that are tangible, exist in space and time as physical matter and/or energy. However, tokens can be intangible objects of types such as "thought", "tennis match", "government" and "act of kindness".

== Occurrences ==
There is a related distinction very closely connected with the type-token distinction. This distinction is the distinction between an object, or type of object, and an '''''occurrence''''' of it. In this sense, an occurrence is not necessarily a token. Considering the sentence: "[[A rose is a rose is a rose]]". We may equally correctly state that there are eight or three words in the sentence. There are, in fact, three word types in the sentence: "rose", "is" and "a". There are eight word tokens in a token copy of the line. The line itself is a type. There are not eight word types in the line. It contains (as stated) only the three word types, 'a', 'is' and 'rose', each of which is unique. So what do we call what there are eight of? They are occurrences of words. There are three occurrences of the word type 'a', two of 'is' and three of 'rose'.

The need to distinguish tokens of types from occurrences of types arises, not just in linguistics, but whenever types of things have other types of things occurring in them.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/types-tokens Types and Tokens]''&lt;/ref&gt; Reflection on the simple case of occurrences of [[numeral system|numerals]] is often helpful.{{citation needed|date=January 2017|reason=Claim made with no support or citation, term used without definition.}}

== Typography ==
In [[typography]], the type–token distinction is used to determine the presence of a text printed by [[movable type]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert E. Brekle|Brekle, Herbert E.]]: ''Die Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift von 1119. Eine paläographisch-typographische Untersuchung'', Scriptorium Verlag für Kultur und Wissenschaft, Regensburg 2005, {{ISBN|3-937527-06-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The defining criteria which a typographic print has to fulfill is that of the type identity of the various [[letter form]]s which make up the printed text. In other words: each letter form which appears in the text has to be shown as a particular instance ("token") of one and the same type which contains a reverse image of the printed [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]].}}

== Charles Sanders Peirce ==
:''There are only 26 letters in the [[English alphabet]] and yet there are more than 26 letters in this [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letters have been created.''

The word 'letters' was used three times in the above paragraph, each time in a different meaning. The word 'letters' is one of many words having "type–token ambiguity". This section disambiguates 'letters' by separating the three senses using terminology standard in logic today. The key distinctions were first made by the American logician-philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in 1906 using terminology that he established.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sanders Peirce, Prolegomena to an apology for pragmaticism, Monist, vol.16 (1906), pp. 492–546.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters that are created by writing are physical objects that can be destroyed by various means: these are letter TOKENS or letter INSCRIPTIONS. The 26 letters of the alphabet are letter TYPES or letter FORMS.

'''Peirce's type–token distinction''', also applies to words, sentences, paragraphs, and so on: to anything in a universe of discourse of character-string theory, or [[concatenation theory]]. There is only one word type spelled el-ee-tee-tee-ee-ar,&lt;ref&gt;Using a variant of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s structural-descriptive naming found in [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]], [https://philarchive.org/archive/CORSTC Schemata: the Concept of Schema in the History of Logic], Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, vol. 12 (2006), pp. 219–40.&lt;/ref&gt; namely, 'letter'; but every time that word type is written, a new word token has been created.

Some logicians consider a word type to be the class of its tokens. Other logicians counter that the word type has a permanence and constancy not found in the class of its tokens. The type remains the same while the class of its tokens is continually gaining new members and losing old members.

The word type 'letter' uses only four letter types: el, ee, tee, and ar. Nevertheless, it uses ee twice and tee twice. In standard terminology, the word type 'letter' has six letter OCCURRENCES and the letter type ee OCCURS twice in the word type 'letter'. Whenever a word type is inscribed, the number of letter tokens created equals the number of letter occurrences in the word type.

Peirce's original words are the following.
"A common mode of estimating the amount of matter in a ... printed book is to count the number of words. There will ordinarily be about twenty 'thes' on a page, and, of course, they count as twenty words. In another sense of the word 'word,' however, there is but one word 'the' in the English language; and it is impossible that this word should lie visibly on a page, or be heard in any voice .... Such a ... Form, I propose to term a Type. A Single ... Object ... such as this or that word on a single line of a single page of a single copy of a book, I will venture to call a Token. .... In order that a Type may be used, it has to be embodied in a Token which shall be a sign of the Type, and thereby of the object the Type signifies." – Peirce 1906, Ogden-Richards, 1923, 280-1.

These distinctions are subtle but solid and easy to master. This section ends using the new terminology to disambiguate the first paragraph.

:''There are 26 letter types in the English alphabet and yet there are more than 26 letter occurrences in this sentence type. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letter tokens have been created.''

The '''Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit''' is a counter-argument to modern versions of the &lt;!--[surplus here?: [[William Paley|Paley]]-style --&gt; [[Teleological argument|argument from design]] for the [[existence of God]]. It was introduced by [[Richard Dawkins]] in chapter 4 of his 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', "Why there almost certainly is no God".

The argument is a play on the notion of a "[[Junkyard tornado|tornado sweeping through a junkyard to assemble a Boeing 747]]" employed to decry [[abiogenesis]] and [[evolution]] as vastly unlikely and better explained by the existence of a [[Creator deity|creator god]]. According to Dawkins, this logic is self-defeating as the [[Theism|theist]] must now account for the god's existence and explain whether or how the god was created. In his view, if the existence of highly complex life on Earth is the equivalent of the implausible junkyard Boeing 747, the existence of a highly complex god is the "ultimate Boeing 747" that truly does require the seemingly impossible to explain its existence.

== Context and history ==
[[File:Richard dawkins lecture.jpg|thumb|upright|The "ultimate Boeing 747 gambit" was originally proposed by [[Richard Dawkins]] in his 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]''.]]
Richard Dawkins begins ''The God Delusion'' by making it clear that the God he talks about is the [[Abrahamic]] concept of a [[personal god]] who is susceptible to worship. He considers the existence of such an entity to be a scientific question, because a universe with such a god would be significantly different from a universe without one, and he says that the difference would be [[Empiricism|empirically]] discernible. Therefore, Dawkins concludes, the same kind of reasoning can be applied to the God hypothesis as to any other scientific question.

After discussing some of the most common arguments for the existence of God in chapter 3, Dawkins concludes that the [[argument from design]] is the most convincing. The extreme improbability of life and a universe capable of hosting it requires explanation, but Dawkins considers the God hypothesis inferior to [[evolution by natural selection]] as [[Evolution of biological complexity|an explanation for the complexity of life]]. As part of his efforts to refute [[intelligent design]], he redirects the [[Irreducible complexity|argument from complexity]] in order to show that God must have been designed by a superintelligent designer, then presents his argument for the improbability of God's existence.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Arguing for Atheism |author=Michael Shermer |journal=Science |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/315/5811/463 |volume=315 |issue=5811 |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2007-03-15 |doi=10.1126/science.1138989 |pages=463 }} (also available via [http://www.screaming-penguin.com/node/6988 the second review here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210162827/http://www.screaming-penguin.com/node/6988 |date=10 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins's name for the statistical demonstration that God almost certainly does not exist is the "Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit". This is an allusion to the [[junkyard tornado]]. [[Astrophysics|Astrophysicist]] [[Fred Hoyle]], who was a [[Darwinist]], [[Atheism|atheist]], [[Antitheism|anti-theist]] and advocate of the [[panspermia]] theory of life,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Collisions of debris as the vehicle for the distribution of biological material across space.&lt;/ref&gt; is reported as having stated that the "probability of life originating on Earth is no greater than the chance that a hurricane, sweeping through a scrapyard, would have the luck to assemble a [[Boeing 747]]."&lt;ref name="tgd113"&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments against empirically based theism date back at least as far as the eighteenth-century philosopher [[David Hume#Design argument|David Hume]], whose objection can be paraphrased as the question "[[Argument from design#Contradictory premises lead to an infinite regress|Who designed the designer?]]". According to philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], however –&amp;nbsp;one of Dawkins's fellow "[[Brights movement|brights]]"&amp;nbsp;– the innovation in Dawkins's argument is twofold: to show that where design fails to explain complexity, evolution by natural selection succeeds as the only workable solution; and to argue how this should illuminate the confusion surrounding the [[anthropic principle]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The notion that "observations of the physical universe must be compatible with [[Consciousness|conscious]] and [[Sapience|sapient]] life that observes it" (see [[Anthropic principle]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dennett"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review of Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion |author=Daniel Dennett |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |journal=Free Inquiry |volume=27 |issue=1 |date=2006-10-16 |url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/dawkinsreview.pdf |accessdate=2006-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dawkins's statement ==
&lt;!--This section heading linked below--&gt;

Dawkins summarizes his argument as follows;&lt;ref&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 157–8.&lt;/ref&gt; the references to "[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea#Skyhooks and cranes|crane]]" and "[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea#Skyhooks and cranes|skyhook]]" are to notions from Daniel Dennett's book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]''.
{{Quotation |
# One of the greatest challenges to the human intellect, over the centuries, has been to explain how the complex, improbable appearance of design in the universe arises.
# The natural temptation is to attribute the appearance of design to actual design itself. In the case of a man-made [[wikt:artefact|artefact&lt;!--UK SPELLING: please don't change (Dawkins is British)--&gt;]] such as a watch, the designer really was an intelligent engineer. It is tempting to apply the same logic to an eye or a wing, a spider or a person.
# The temptation is a false one, because the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer. The whole problem we started out with was the problem of explaining statistical improbability. It is obviously no solution to postulate something even more improbable. We need a "crane", not a "skyhook"; for only a crane can do the business of working up gradually and plausibly from simplicity to otherwise improbable complexity.
# The most ingenious and powerful crane so far discovered is Darwinian evolution by natural selection. Darwin and his successors have shown how living creatures, with their spectacular statistical improbability and appearance of design, have evolved by slow, gradual degrees from simple beginnings. We can now safely say that the illusion of design in living creatures is just that{{spndash}}an illusion.
# We don't yet have an equivalent crane for physics. Some kind of multiverse theory could in principle do for physics the same explanatory work as Darwinism does for biology. This kind of explanation is superficially less satisfying than the biological version of Darwinism, because it makes heavier demands on luck. But the [[anthropic principle]] entitles us to postulate far more luck than our limited human intuition is comfortable with.
# We should not give up hope of a better crane arising in physics, something as powerful as Darwinism is for biology. But even in the absence of a strongly satisfying crane to match the biological one, the relatively weak cranes we have at present are, when abetted by the anthropic principle, self-evidently better than the self-defeating skyhook hypothesis of an intelligent designer.}}

A central thesis of the argument is that compared to supernatural abiogenesis, evolution by natural selection requires the supposition of fewer hypothetical processes; according to [[Occam's razor]], therefore, it is a better explanation. Dawkins cites a paragraph where [[Richard Swinburne]] agrees that a simpler explanation is better but reasons that theism is simpler because it only invokes a single &lt;!--[is "substance" sic?:]--&gt;substance (God) as a cause and maintainer of every other object. This cause is seen as [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]] and totally "free". Dawkins argues that an entity that monitors and controls every particle in the universe and listens to all thoughts and prayers cannot be simple. Its existence would require a "mammoth explanation" of its own. The theory of natural selection is much simpler –&amp;nbsp;and thus preferable&amp;nbsp;– than a theory of the existence of such a complex being.&lt;ref&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 147–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins then turns to a discussion of [[Keith Ward]]'s views on [[divine simplicity]] to show the difficulty "the theological mind has in grasping where the complexity of life comes from." Dawkins writes that Ward is sc&lt;!--UK SPELLING (please don't change)--&gt;eptical of [[Arthur Peacocke]]'s ideas that evolution is directed by other forces than only natural selection and that these processes may have a propensity toward increasing complexity. Dawkins says that this sc&lt;!--UK SPELLING (please don't change)--&gt;epticism is justified, because complexity does not come from biased mutations. Dawkins writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Natural selection], as far as we know, is the only process ultimately capable of generating complexity out of simplicity. The theory of natural selection is genuinely simple. So is the origin from which it starts. That which it explains, on the other hand, is complex almost beyond telling: more complex than anything we can imagine, save a God capable of designing it.&lt;ref name="tgd151"&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Assessment and criticism ==

Theist authors have presented extensive opposition, most notably by theologian [[Alister McGrath]] (in ''[[The Dawkins Delusion?]]'') and philosophers [[Alvin Plantinga]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=God Is Great, God Is Good |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rX3tGSzi16AC&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plantinga"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/bc/2007/002/1.21.html |title=The Dawkins Confusion — Naturalism ad absurdum |work=Books &amp; Culture, a Christian Review |author=[[Alvin Plantinga]] |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

 --&gt; Another negative review, by biologist [[H. Allen Orr]], sparked heated debate, prompting, for example, the mathematician [[Norman Levitt]] to ask why theologians are assumed to have the exclusive right to write about who "rules" the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What a Friend We Have in Dawkins |author=Norman Levitt |work=eSkeptic |url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-01-31.html |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2007-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
 --&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] also took exception to Orr's review, leading to an exchange of open letters between himself and Orr.&lt;ref&gt;Full [http://www.edge.org/discourse/dennett_orr.html#dd exchange of open letters] at edge.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
 --&gt; The philosopher Sir [[Anthony Kenny]] also considers this argument to be flawed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Kenny]], 2007 Presidential [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]] Annual Lecture (published in ''Philosophy'' Volume 82 number 321 (July 2007), pp. 381-397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
 --&gt; Cosmologist [[Stephen Barr]]&lt;ref name="Stephen M Barr 2003"&gt;Stephen M Barr (2003), ''Modern Physics and Ancient faith'' ({{ISBN|0-268-03471-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt; responded as follows: "[[William Paley|Paley]] finds a [[Watchmaker analogy|watch and asks how]] such a thing could have come to be there by chance. Dawkins finds an immense automated factory that blindly constructs watches, and feels that he has completely answered Paley's point."&lt;ref&gt;Modern Physics and Ancient Faith Paperback – February 15, 2006 by Stephen M Barr&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simplicity of God and materialist assumptions===
Both Alvin Plantinga and Richard Swinburne raise the objection that God is not complex. Swinburne gives two reasons why a God that controls every particle can be simple: first, a person, as indicated by phenomena such as [[split-brain]]s, is not the same as their highly complex brain but "is something simpler" that can "control" that brain; and second, simplicity is a [[Quality (philosophy)|quality that is intrinsic]] to a hypothesis, not related to its empirical consequences.&lt;ref name="swinburne"/&gt;

Plantinga writes:
{{Quote
 | So first, according to classical theology, God is simple, not complex. More remarkable, perhaps, is that according to Dawkins's own definition of complexity, God is not complex. According to his definition (set out in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''), something is complex if it has parts that are "arranged in a way that is unlikely to have arisen by chance alone." But of course God is a spirit, not a material object at all, and hence has no parts. ''A fortiori'' (as philosophers like to say) God doesn't have parts arranged in ways unlikely to have arisen by chance. Therefore, given the definition of complexity Dawkins himself proposes, God is not complex."
}}
He continues:
{{Quote
 | "But second, suppose we concede, at least for purposes of argument, that God is complex. Perhaps we think the more a being knows, the more complex it is; God, being [[omniscient]], would then be highly complex. Given [[materialism]] and the idea that the ultimate objects in our universe are the elementary particles of physics, perhaps a being that knew a great deal would be improbable{{spndash}}how could those particles get arranged in such a way as to constitute a being with all that knowledge? Of course we aren't given materialism.&lt;ref name="plantinga"/&gt;
}}
In other words, Plantinga concludes that this argument, to be valid, would require materialism to be true; but, as materialism is not compatible with traditional theology,{{clarify|date=November 2014}} the argument [[Begging the question|begs the question]] by requiring its [[premise]] to assume God's non-existence.&lt;ref name="plantinga"/&gt;

In an extensive analysis published in ''[[Science and Christian Belief]]'', Patrick Richmond suggests that "Dawkins is right to object to unexplained organised complexity in God" but that God is simply specified and lacks the sort of composition and limitations found in [physical] creatures; hence the theist can explain why nature exists without granting unexplained organised complexity or the extreme improbability of God.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Richmond, "Richard Dawkins's Darwinian Objection to Unexplained Complexity in God", ''[[Science and Christian Belief]]'' Vol. 19 No. 2 (2007), pp. 99-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some respondents, such as [[Stephen Law]], have suggested that God is or would indeed be complex if responsible [[Creator deity|for creating]] and [[God the Sustainer|sustaining the universe]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3fGJq04rUc ''The Strengths and Weaknesses of the God Delusion''] (YouTube).&lt;/ref&gt; God's omniscience would require the retention of and ability to use all knowledge. Concepts such as [[Kolmogorov complexity]] have also been used to argue that God is or would need to be complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://omnisaffirmatioestnegatio.wordpress.com/2010/06/12/dawkins-and-the-ultimate-747-gambit/ ''Dawkins and the Ultimate Boeing 747 Gambit'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necessity of external explanations===
There are many variations on how to express this objection. [[William F. Vallicella]] holds that organized complexity as such does not need explanation, because when in search of an ultimate explanation, one must in the end accept an entity whose complexity has no external explanation.&lt;ref name="vallicella"&gt;[http://maverickphilosopher.powerblogs.com/posts/1167878240.shtml Vallicella's discussion with] [[Erik Wielenberg]].&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins has stated that we should search for simple beginnings for explanations, like in evolution which moves from simple to complex, and so what we ultimately accept with no external explanation must be simple for it to be a good explanation.&lt;ref name="Dawkins-Lennox"&gt;[http://www.fixed-point.org/index.php/video/35-full-length/164-the-dawkins-lennox-debate The God Delusion Debate: Richard Dawkins vs John Lennox] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625134059/http://www.fixed-point.org/index.php/video/35-full-length/164-the-dawkins-lennox-debate |date=25 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And Plantinga writes that when ''not'' in search for an ultimate explanation of organized complexity, it is perfectly fine to explain one kind of complexity, that of terrestrial life, in terms of another kind of complexity, namely divine activity.&lt;ref name="plantinga"/&gt; Dawkins addresses this point in his debate with John Lennox over ''The God Delusion'', saying that it would be perfectly reasonable to infer from artifacts on earth or another planet that an intelligence existed, but that you would still need to explain that intelligence, which evolution does, while for God's existence there is no such explanation.&lt;ref name="Dawkins-Lennox"/&gt;

Alister McGrath suggests that the leap from the recognition of complexity to the assertion of improbability is problematic, as a [[theory of everything]] would be more complex than the theories it would replace, yet one would not conclude that it is less probable. Dawkins has responded to this point in his debate with Lennox and at other times, saying that while physics is hard to understand, fundamentally, unlike biology, it is simple.&lt;ref name="Dawkins-Lennox"/&gt; McGrath then argues that probability is not relevant to the question of existence: life on earth is highly improbable and yet we exist. The important question in his view is not whether God is ''probable'', but whether God is ''actual''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dawkins Delusion?'', pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; In interviewing McGrath for ''The Root of All Evil'', Dawkins responds that the existence of life on Earth is indeed highly improbable, but this is exactly why a theory such as evolution is required to explain that improbability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6474278760369344626# Root of All Evil? The Uncut Interviews] (Google Video).&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of God, Dawkins says, there is no such satisfactory explanation.

On the point of probability, Alvin Plantinga claims that if God is a [[Argument from contingency|necessary being]], as argued by classical theism, God is, by definition, maximally probable; thus an argument that there is no necessary being with the qualities attributed to God is required to demonstrate God's improbability.&lt;ref name="plantinga"/&gt; Eric MacDonald has pointed out that theists assume the coherence of their position when they make arguments for God when, by Plantinga's standards, they would have to present an argument that the concept of God is not logically incoherent before discussing other arguments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://choiceindying.com/2011/05/18/duking-it-out-over-the-god-delusion/ ''Duking it Out Over the God Delusion'']&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's objection would seem to apply to all atheist arguments that contend that God is improbable, such as evidential arguments about the [[problem of evil]] and the [[argument from nonbelief]]. But the reason why theists and atheists do not usually address this prior to making their arguments is because they want to go beyond merely discussing whether God is maximally probable or impossible.

===Dawkins's response to criticism in ''The God Delusion''===
Dawkins writes about his attendance at a conference in Cambridge sponsored by the [[John Templeton Foundation|Templeton Foundation]],&lt;ref name="tgd151"/&gt; where he challenged the theologians present to respond to the argument that a creator of a complex universe would have to be complex and improbable.&lt;ref&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; He reports the strongest response as the claim he was imposing a scientific [[epistemology]] on a question that lies beyond the realm of science. When theologians hold God to be simple, who is a scientist like Dawkins "to dictate to theologians that their God had to be complex?"&lt;ref name="tgd154"&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins writes that he did not feel that those employing this "evasive" defence were being "wilfully dishonest", but that they were "defining themselves into an epistemological safe-zone where rational argument could not reach them because they had ''declared by fiat'' that it could not."&lt;ref name="tgd154"/&gt;

Theologians, Dawkins writes, demand that there be a [[Cosmological argument|first cause]] named "God". Dawkins responds that it must have been a simple cause and contends that unless "God" is divested of its normal associations, it is not an appropriate name. Postulating a prime mover that is capable of indulging in intelligent design is, in Dawkins's opinion, "a total abdication of the responsibility to find an explanation"; instead, he seeks a "self-bootstrapping crane" ([[#Dawkins's statement|see above]]) that can "lift" the universe into more complex states. This, he states, does not necessitate a {{clarify-span|narrowly scientific|date=November 2014}} explanation, but does require a "crane" rather than a "skyhook" (''[[#Dawkins's statement|ibid.]]'') if it is to account for the complexity of the natural world.&lt;ref name="tgd155"&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mercury, Moon, and Earth===

{{Main|Lunar water}}

Recent observation made by a number of spacecraft confirmed significant amounts of [[Lunar water]]. Mercury does not appear to contain observable quantities of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, presumably due to loss from giant impacts.&lt;ref name = Drake2005/&gt; In contrast, Earth's hydrosphere contains ~{{convert|1.46e21|kg|abbr=on}} of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and [[sedimentary rock]]s contain ~{{convert|0.21e21|kg|abbr=on}}, for a total crustal inventory of ~{{convert|1.67e21|kg|abbr=on}} of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref name = Kulikov2006/&gt; The mantle inventory is poorly constrained in the range of {{convert|0.5e21-4e21|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = Morbidelli2000&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morbidelli|first1=A.|last2=Chambers|first2=J.|last3=Lunine|first3=J.

===Venus===

{{Main|Atmosphere of Venus}}

The current Venusian atmosphere has only ~200&amp;nbsp;mg/kg H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(g) in its atmosphere and the pressure and temperature regime makes water unstable on its surface. Nevertheless, assuming that early Venus's H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O had a D/H ratio similar to Earth's Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water ([[VSMOW]]) of 1.6×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name = NIST&gt;[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (2005), [https://srmors.nist.gov/certificates/8535.pdf?CFID=12001608&amp;CFTOKEN=5c24bc7fc8132ce6-2B2520A5-A7C5-6123-0D31F83B0741932B&amp;jsessionid=b430d26f379de78357e1 Report of Investigation]&lt;/ref&gt; the current D/H isotopic ratio in the Venusian atmosphere of 1.9×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, at nearly ×120 of Earth's, may indicate that Venus had a much larger H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O inventory.&lt;ref name = Kulikov2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kulikov|first1=Yu.

==Accretion of water by Earth and Mars==

{{Main|Origin of water on Earth}}

The D/H isotopic ratio is a primary constraint on the source of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O of terrestrial planets. Comparison of the planetary D/H ratios with those of carbonaceous chondrites and comets enables a tentative determination of the source of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The best constraints for accreted H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are determined from non-atmospheric H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, as the D/H ratio of the atmospheric component may be subject to rapid alteration by the preferential loss of H &lt;ref name=Jakosky2001/&gt; unless it is in isotopic equilibrium with surface H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Earth's VSMOW D/H ratio of 1.6×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=NIST/&gt; and modeling of impacts suggest that the cometary contribution to crustal water was less than 10%. However, much of the water could be derived from Mercury-sized planetary embryos that formed in the [[asteroid belt]] beyond 2.5&amp;nbsp;AU.&lt;ref name = Lunine2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lunine|first1=J. I.|last2=Chambers|first2=J.|last3=Morbidelli|first3=A.|last4=Leshin|first4=L. A.|title=The origin of water on Mars|journal=Icarus|date=2003|volume=165|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1016/S0019-1035(03)00172-6|bibcode=2003Icar..165....1L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mars's original D/H ratio, as estimated by deconvolving the atmospheric and magmatic D/H components in [[Mars meteorite|Martian meteorites]] (e.g., QUE 94201), is ×(1.9+/-0.25) the VSMOW value.&lt;ref name=Lunine2003/&gt; The higher D/H and impact modeling (significantly different from Earth due to Mars's smaller mass) favor a model where Mars accreted a total of 6% to 27% the mass of the current Earth hydrosphere, corresponding respectively to an original D/H between ×1.6 and ×1.2 the SMOW value.&lt;ref name = Lunine2003/&gt; The former enhancement is consistent with roughly equal asteroidal and cometary contributions, while the latter would indicate mostly asteroidal contributions.&lt;ref name=Lunine2003/&gt; The corresponding WEG would be {{convert|0.6-2.7|km|abbr=on}}, consistent with a 50% outgassing efficiency to yield ~{{convert|500|m|abbr=on}} WEG of surface water.&lt;ref name = Lunine2003/&gt; Comparing the current atmospheric D/H ratio of ×5.5 SMOW ratio with the primordial ×1.6 SMOW ratio suggests that ~{{convert|50|m|abbr=on}} of has been lost to space via [[solar wind]] stripping.&lt;ref name=Lunine2003/&gt;

The cometary and asteroidal delivery of water to accreting Earth and Mars has significant caveats, even though it is favored by D/H isotopic ratios.&lt;ref name=Drake2005/&gt; Key issues include:&lt;ref name=Drake2005/&gt;

# The higher D/H ratios in Martian meteorites could be a consequence of biased sampling since Mars may have never had an effective [[crustal recycling]] process
# Earth's Primitive Upper Mantle estimate of the &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Os/&lt;sup&gt;188&lt;/sup&gt;Os isotopic ratio exceeds 0.129, significantly greater than that of carbonaceous chondrites, but similar to anhydrous ordinary chondrites. This makes it unlikely that planetary embryos compositionally similar to carbonaceous chondrites supplied water to Earth
# Earth's atmospheric content of Ne is significantly higher than would be expected had all the rare gases and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O been accreted from planetary embryos with carbonaceous chondritic compositions.&lt;ref name = Morbidelli2000/&gt;

An alternative to the cometary and asteroidal delivery of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O would be the accretion via physisorption during the formation of the terrestrial planets in the [[solar nebula]]. This would be consistent with the thermodynamic estimate of around two Earth masses of [[water vapor]] within 3AU of the solar accretionary disk, which would exceed by a factor of 40 the mass of water needed to accrete the equivalent of 50 Earth hydrospheres (the most extreme estimate of Earth's bulk H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O content) per terrestrial planet.&lt;ref name = Drake2005/&gt; Even though much of the nebular H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(g) may be lost due to the high temperature environment of the accretionary disk, it is possible for physisorption of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O on accreting grains to retain nearly three Earth hydrospheres of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O at {{convert|500|K|C F}} temperatures.&lt;ref name = Drake2005/&gt; This adsorption model would effectively avoid the &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Os/&lt;sup&gt;188&lt;/sup&gt;Os isotopic ratio disparity issue of distally-sourced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. However, the current best estimate of the nebular D/H ratio spectroscopically estimated with Jovian and Saturnian atmospheric CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is only 2.1×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;, a factor of 8 lower than Earth's VSMOW ratio.&lt;ref name = Drake2005/&gt; It is unclear how such a difference could exist, if physisorption were indeed the dominant form of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O accretion for Earth in particular and the terrestrial planets in general.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11848">'''Wing-shape optimization''' is a software implementation of [[shape optimization]] primarily used for aircraft design.  This allows for engineers to produce more efficient and cheaper aircraft designs.

==History==
Shape optimization, as a software process and tool, first appeared as an [[algorithm]] in 1995 and as commercial software for the [[automotive industry]] by 1998, as noted by F. Muyl.&lt;ref&gt;F. Muyl, L. Dumas, V. Herbert.  [http://www.ann.jussieu.fr/~dumas/Lisbon02.pdf “Hybrid Method for Aerodynamic Shape Optimization in Automotive Industry.”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051018235247/http://www.ann.jussieu.fr/~dumas/Lisbon02.pdf |date=October 18, 2005 }}  Universite Pierre et Marie Curie.  1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relative to the age of the automotive and aeronautical companies, this software is very new.  The difficulty was not with the science behind the process, but rather the capabilities of computer hardware.  In 1998, F. Muyl developed a compromise between exact accuracy and computational time to reduce drag of an automotive.  GA phases are the standard [[genetic algorithm]] iterations and the BFGS phases are the approximated calculations designed to save time.  However, he acknowledged that the [[computational time]] required on existing hardware, nearly two weeks for a moderate improvement on an oversimplified proof of concept model, made it unattractive for commercial purposes.  He also recognized that improving the modeling implementation to use automatic partial derivatives might improve the computational time, particularly with specialized hardware.
In 2000, after a couple years of computer hardware development, K. Maute &lt;ref&gt;Joaquim R. R. A. Martins and Juan J. Alonso. [http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/Papers/ceas2001.pdf “AERO-STRUCTURAL WING DESIGN OPTIMIZATION USING HIGH-FIDELITY SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS.”] Confederation of European Aerospace Societies. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced a more accurate system that could optimize an aircraft wing quickly enough for commercial use. 

==Method==
Wing-shape optimization is by nature an [[iterative]] process.  First, a baseline wing design is chosen to begin the process with; this is usually the wing created by [[aerospace engineer]]s.  This wing is assumed to be reasonably close to a best-fit design from the engineers.  The next step is to model the wing shape and structure.  Once those are mapped out, the software flies the model in a simulated air tunnel using well-developed [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) equations.  The results of the test give the various [[performance characteristics]] of that design.  Once that completes, the software makes incremental changes to the structure and shape details, recreates the model, and flies the new model through a [[wind tunnel]].  If the changes result in a better performing wing, then the software commits the changes.  If not, the changes are thrown out and different changes are made.  The changes are then saved as the new working model and the cycle will loop.  This entire process is run until the changes observed appear to converge on a design&amp;nbsp;– such as when the changes are under 1&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="stanford.edu"&gt;Jameson, A., Leoviriyakit, K., and Shankaran, S., [http://www.stanford.edu/~kasidit/publications/jameson.aiaa.07-764.pdf "Multi-point Aero-Structural Optimization of Wings Including Planform Variations"]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}, 45th Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, AIAA-2007-764, Reno, NV, 8–11 Jan 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the resulting wing design can only be as good as the computational model.

==Examples==
===Traditional===
An example of an optimization proof of concept was done in 2003 by Leoviriyakit using the Boeing 747–200.&lt;ref&gt;K. Leoviriyakit and A. Jameson. [http://www.stanford.edu/~kasidit/publications/leoviriyakit.aiaa.03-0210.pdf “Aerodynamic shape optimization of wings including planform variations.”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030804171702/http://www.stanford.edu/~kasidit/publications/leoviriyakit.aiaa.03-0210.pdf |date=2003-08-04 }} AIAA paper 2003-0210, 41 Aerospace Sciences Meeting &amp; Exhibit, Reno, Nevada, January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Using the variable list above, he optimized for only a single point – a lift coefficient of 0.42 and a speed of [[Mach number|Mach]] 0.87, just above cruising.  With just those few variables, he was able to realize a 12% decrease in [[drag (physics)|drag]] and a 0.1% decrease in wing weight.  The code that was run produced a longer span but less sweep-back than the original wing planform.  While the reduction in sweep-back actually increases drag it also increases lift allowing a lower AoA and the extended wing span  decreases the induced drag (wing tip vortex) resulting in a net reduction of drag.  Unfortunately, his optimized design uses too simple of a model; he realized that had more variables, such as [[viscous]] effects, been taken into consideration, the resulting model would have been far different.  The other major limitation of the [[single point]] approach is that it only optimizes the wing for one speed and lift condition.  While the drag may have been reduced at cruising speed, it might have been drastically increased for take-off and landing, resulting in a net fuel loss for the airline.

===Wing-body===
This process can also be extended to explore single wing-body aircraft designs.  Wing-body styled aircraft can scale up their cargo much easier than the traditional ‘tube and plank’ design.  Airbus utilized this approach to explore design choices in future large aircraft in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;M. Mialon, T. Fol, and C. Bonnand. [http://www.onera.fr/daap-en/flying-wings/aerodynamic-optimization-of-subsonic-flying-wing-configurations.pdf “AERODYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION OF SUBSONIC FLYING WING CONFIGURATIONS.”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206105003/http://www.onera.fr/daap-en/flying-wings/aerodynamic-optimization-of-subsonic-flying-wing-configurations.pdf |date=2006-12-06 }} AIAA paper 2002–2931.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their objectives, however, were slightly more complex than the original design of the software: the aircraft needs a maximized [[lift to drag ratio]], to be longitudinally neutral (not wanting to pitch up or down while without a tail), to have a maximum [[angle of attack]], to have a minimum [[cabin (aircraft)|cabin]] volume and shape, and have a maximum thickness on the outboard wings.  Using three different components, they expanded their computational model to incorporate as many constraints as possible, including viscous effects.  This method involves significantly more computational power.
Their initial findings saved a lot of money in building and testing – since it causes supersonic flow of air, a [[shock wave]] forms on the aft part of the wing, drastically increasing drag and reducing lift.  After modifying their goals to only keep the lift to drag ratio high and even out the pressure, the simulation provided a better design – showing that this tool is very adaptable to the situation at hand. 
The end result of this study was that Airbus had a set of airfoil designs that are suited to a very large wing-body aircraft.  This also proved that these methods are successful at adapting to any task that they would require.

===Post-manufacturing changes===
This method of [[process optimization|optimization]] can also be used to develop a post-manufacture modification to an existing wing.  In 2006, Antony Jameson modified the code to increase the speed of a race [[P-51 Mustang]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Jameson. [http://www.stanford.edu/~kasidit/publications/jameson.aiaa.06-0048.pdf “Aerodynamic Shape Optimization for the World's Fastest P-51.”]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 44th Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, January 9–12, 2006, AIAA-0048, Reno, Nevada.&lt;/ref&gt;  This goal is different still – the [[Reno Air Race]] is a straight drag from one point to another at a relatively low altitude.  The goal is to improve the top speed to reach a [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]-driven record.  Since the change must be glued onto the wing, this severely limits the changes possible.  The problem is similar to the previous example – shock wave buildup.  To accomplish this, the software was restricted to find a solution that could only distort the wing planform outwards, away from the control surfaces.  Using a [[lift coefficient]] of 0.1 and a speed of Mach 0.78, the software produced a bump near the front of the top of the wing.  The interruptions of air flow at that particular speed travel back the right distance to break up the shock, reducing the drag.  While the aircraft’s drag was increased below Mach 0.73, that was thrown out as being less important than a top speed. If these modifications perform as expected, then this validates the use of the software tool to improve on an existing production wing without remanufacture.

==Multi-point optimization==
Still, all of these methods have a weakness – they are tuned for one particular set of conditions and speed.  In 2007, Jameson introduced both an additional step and a new method of calculations.&lt;ref name="stanford.edu"/&gt;  To account for additional conditions, such as take-off, landing, climbing, and cruising, the modeler calculates all of these simultaneously, rather than only one at a time.  Each gradient calculation g is assigned a weight β.  Higher priority items, such as cruising drag, are given more weight.  The gradient to determine an overall ‘loss’ or a ‘gain’ for the design is created by summing all the gradients times each respective weight.  What this allows for is if a change drastically improves takeoff performance but results in a slight hit on cruising performance, the cruising hit can override the takeoff gain due to weighting.  Setting the simulation up in this manner can significantly improve the designs produced by the software.  This version of the modeler, however, adds yet another complexity to the initial conditions, and a slight error on the designer’s behalf can have a significantly larger effect on the resulting design.  The calculation efficiency improvement takes advantage of the multiple variables.
This time, two different points were used for the [[Boeing 747-200]] – Mach 0.85 and 0.87.  Unfortunately, optimizing for the two points resulted in less than a 3% improvement over drag and almost no weight improvement on the base design.  To check his work, he used the same simulation on another aircraft wing and received similar results.  The problem observed is that changes that boosted one point of interest directly conflicted with the other, and the resulting compromise severely hampers the improvement gained.  His current research involves a better way to resolve the differences and achieve an improvement similar to the single-point optimizations.

&lt;!--[[WP:CRYSTAL BALL]]
==Future==
The future of this technology lies in the accuracy of the models.  Computer hardware has followed [[Moore’s Law]] in computational power still to this day, and so the current limitation is the attention to detail on behalf of the programmers and engineers.  As more accurate models are produced, better aircraft wings can be produced.
Much farther in the future, when more advanced hardware structures are developed, it will be possible to have dynamically adapting wings based on current flight conditions.  As shown, the software portion of this problem is already solved: single-point calculations can be done on the fly for the particular speed and conditions, giving the possibility of achieving significant drag reduction throughout the entire flight.--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6864">'''Wonderbag''' is a stand-alone, non-electric insulated bag designed to reduce the amount of [[fuel]] required in the [[cooking]] of food in [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name=sfchr/&gt; Instead of being placed on a [[stove]] for the duration of the cooking period, food is instead heated to a hot enough temperature then transferred to the Wonderbag, which uses the principle of [[thermal insulation]] to continue cooking, and keeps food warm without needing additional fire or heat.&lt;ref name=sfchr/&gt;  Working on the principle of [[thermal cooking]], the Wonderbag is estimated to save up to 30% of the total fuel costs associated with cooking with [[Kerosene]] ("paraffin") alone. In developing countries there are numerous advantages for the product, as it immediately helps ease [[deforestation]] of natural reserves, and it frees up those who would spend their time gathering the extra wood for fire fuel.&lt;ref name=sfchr/&gt;

Designed by [[Durban]], [[South Africa]]-based entrepreneur Sarah Collins of Natural Balance, and [[poverty]] activist Moshy Mathe, the Wonderbag is aimed at societies where fuel is expensive or time-consuming to gather.

As of January 2012, over 150,000 Wonderbags were in use in South Africa, with the manufacturers and partners such as [[Unilever]] intending to promote the use of the device worldwide.&lt;ref name="psfk" /&gt; {{As of|January 2013}} over 650,000 have been distributed in "South Africa, [[Rwanda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Syria]]n refugee camps in [[Jordan]]."&lt;ref name=sfchr/&gt;

== History ==
Sarah Collins developed the idea for the Wonderbag during power outages in South Africa in 2008.&lt;ref name="Lean2011" /&gt;

Anna Pearce describes in her book "Simply Living - The Story of the Compassion and the Wonderbox" from 1989 how the old idea of the hayboxes turned into polystyrene filled cushions - The Wonderbox - to cook in South Africa ({{ISBN|1 85421 048 3}}) Wonderboxes were also distributed beginning as early as 1976, while not a new invention, the wonderbag is an innovative take on an old design.

The original Wonderbox was designed and produced by Shirley Buys (nee' Woodbridge) in Durban in 1976, based upon the Hay Box design used in her childhood in war-time England. Shirley trained as a patternmaker and designed the inverted oversized 'beanbag' containing recycled polystyrene chips in a polyester-cotton fabric bag and lid within a corrugated cardboard box and personally marketed it across Zululand between 1976 and 1980. Compassion of South Africa, a non-sectarian Christian action group opposing Apartheid, and the particular assistance from Brigid Oppenheimer facilitated Shirley's design and marketing and published a comprehensive recipe book &lt;ref&gt;https://thermalcooker.wordpress.com/2008/07/26/wonder-box-recipe-booklet/&lt;/ref&gt;with a lot of graphics to help illiterate users follow the recipes.&lt;ref&gt;http://foodstorageandsurvival.com/building-a-wonderbox-style-insulated-cooking-box&lt;/ref&gt; The design was deliberately not patented and Compassion of South Africa asked to be recognised in the sharing of the recipe book.  Shirley manufactured the Wonderbox in her workshop in her Morningside Durban home for over 3 years before Compassion established several other manufacturing facilities across South African, and shared the design freely. 

== Design ==
The Wonderbag consists of an inner layer of insulation containing recycled [[polystyrene]] balls, with an outer, [[drawstring]]&lt;ref name="Metro" /&gt; covering of polyester-cotton blend textiles.&lt;ref name="psfk" /&gt; The manufacturers expect that in time the polystyrene (which is non-[[Biodegradation|biodegradeable]]) will be replaced with a [[polyurethane]] blend.&lt;ref name="Lean2011" /&gt;

== Use ==
To use the Wonderbag, first a [[Cookware and bakeware|cooking pot]] is heated as normal on a stove until it reaches the required cooking temperature. At this point, the pot is removed from the stove and placed in the bag, where due to the insulation the receptacle remains near the stovetop temperature for an extended period. Rice, for instance, may be cooked by heating in a pot of water for two minutes until the water boils and then placing in the Wonderbag for another hour, while for a meat dish the stovetop time is twenty minutes and the bag time five hours.&lt;ref name="psfk" /&gt;

== Fuel savings ==
Due to the reduction in fuel used, the Wonderbag is estimated to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to half a ton per year if used three times a week.&lt;ref name="Lean2011" /&gt;

== Retail and production ==
The Wonderbag is available in the United States.
