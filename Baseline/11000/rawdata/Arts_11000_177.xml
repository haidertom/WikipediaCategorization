[[File:Derain CharingCrossBridge.png|thumb|280px|[[André Derain]], 1906, ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'', co-founder of [[Fauvism]] with [[Matisse]]]]

'''20th-century French art''' developed out of the [[Impressionism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]] that dominated French art at the end of the 19th century. The first half of the 20th century in France saw the even more revolutionary experiments of [[Cubism]], [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]], artistic movements that would have a major impact on western, and eventually world, art. After World War II, while French artists explored such tendencies as [[Tachism]], [[Fluxus]] and [[New realism]], France's preeminence in the visual arts progressively became eclipsed by developments elsewhere (the United States in particular).

==From Impressionism to World War II==
[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1912, Les Baigneuses, oil on canvas, 105 x 171 cm, Paris, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris.jpg|thumb|left|280px|[[Albert Gleizes]], 1912, ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)]]'', oil on canvas, 105 x 171 cm, [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]]]]
The early years of the twentieth century were dominated by [[Neo-Impressionism]] and [[Divisionism]], experiments in colour and content that [[Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]] and [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolism]] had unleashed. The products of the far east also brought new influences. [[Les Nabis]] explored a decorative art in flat plains with a Japanese print graphic approach. From 1904 [[Fauvism|Les Fauves]] exploded in color (much like German [[Expressionism]]).

The influence of African tribal masks led [[Pablo Picasso]] to his ''[[Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' of 1907. Picasso and [[Georges Braque]] (working independently) returned to and refined Cézanne's way of rationally understanding objects in a flat medium; but their experiments in cubism would also lead them to integrate all aspects of day-to-day life: newspapers, musical instruments, cigarettes, wine. Picasso and Braque exhibited their analytical [[Cubism]] under an exclusivity contract at the gallery of [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]], located on a quiet street behind [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]] in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]]. At the same time, [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Fernand Léger]] exhibited alternate forms of Cubism at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] and the [[Salon d'Automne]]; massive exhibitions that brought Cubism to the attention of the general public. These artists had no intention of analyzing and describing mundane objects from daily life—a bowl of fruit, a pipe, violin or guitar—but chose subjects of vast proportion, of provocative social and cultural significance, expressing the dynamic qualities of modern urban life.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund.]&lt;/ref&gt; Cubism in all its phases and divers styles would dominate Europe and America for the next ten years.

[[File:Jean Metzinger, Le goûter, Tea Time, 1911, 75.9 x 70.2 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]], 1911, ''[[Le goûter (Tea Time)]]'', oil on canvas, 75.9 x 70.2 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art. Exhibited at the 1911 Salon d'Automne. Published in ''Fantasio'', 15 Oct. 1911, ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' by Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, 1912, and ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes]]'' by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], 1913, Paris. [[André Salmon]] dubbed this painting "The Mona Lisa of Cubism"]]
[[World War I]] did not stop the dynamic creation of art in France. In 1916 a group of discontents met in a bar in Zurich (the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]]) and create the most radical gesture possible: the anti-art of [[Dada]]. At the same time, [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] were exploring similar notions. At an art show in New York in 1917 Duchamp presented a white porcelain urinal signed ''R. Mutt'' as work of art, becoming the father of the "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]]".

The killing fields of the war (nearly one-tenth of the French adult male population had been killed or wounded) had made many see the absurdity of existence. This was also the period when the ''[[Lost Generation]]'' took hold: rich Americans enjoying the liberties of [[Prohibition]]-free France in the 1920s and poor G.I.'s going abroad for the first time. Paris was also, for [[African-Americans]], amazingly free of the racial restrictions found in America ([[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Josephine Baker]]).

When Dada reached Paris, it was avidly embraced by a group of young artists and writers who were fascinated with the writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], and particularly by the notion of the [[unconscious mind]]. The provocative spirit of Dada became linked to the exploration of the unconscious mind through the use of [[automatic writing]], chance operations and, in some cases, altered states. The surrealists quickly turned to painting and sculpture. The shock of unexpected elements, the use of [[Frottage (surrealist technique)|Frottage]], [[collage]] and [[decalcomania]], the rendering of mysterious landscapes and dreamscapes were to become the key techniques through the rest of the 1930s.

[[World War II]] ended the feast. Many surrealists like [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Max Ernst]], [[André Breton]] and [[André Masson]] fled occupied France for New York and the States (Duchamp had already been in the U.S. since 1936), but the cohesion and vibrancy were lost in the American city.

==Post World War II==
{{French art history}}
The French art scene immediately after the war went roughly in several directions. There were those who continued in the artistic experiments of the 1930s and 1940s, especially [[Surrealism]] and [[Geometric abstraction]], and there were those associated with [[Lyrical abstraction]], [[Tachisme]], [[Nuagisme]], [[:fr:Art informel|Art Informel]] and ''paysagisme abstrait'' (modes of expression along similar lines as [[Abstract Expressionism]] or [[action painting]] from New York). These artists included [[Wols]], [[Jean Fautrier]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]], [[:fr:Jean Degottex|Jean Degottex]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Jean Messagier]] and [[Georges Mathieu]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/youngereuropeanp00swee#page/33/mode/2up Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, ''Younger European painters: a selection'', exhibition catalogue, 2 December 1953 - 21 February 1954]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, [[Jean Dubuffet]] dominated the early post-war years while exploring childlike drawings, graffiti and cartoons in a variety of media in what he called "Art Brut" (see [[Outsider art]]). Meanwhile, [[François Fiedler]] went searching for the perfect combination of color and texture amongst the multitudinous layers of paint that found its way onto his canvas.

In 1960, [[Pierre Restany]] and [[Yves Klein]] founded the [[New Realism]] movement (in French: ''Nouveau Réalisme''), and a joint declaration was signed on October 27, 1960, by nine people: Yves Klein, [[Arman]], [[:fr:Francois Dufrêne|Francois Dufrêne]], [[Raymond Hains]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Pierre Restany]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Jean Tinguely]] and [[Jacques de la Villeglé]]; in 1961 these were joined by [[César Baldaccini|César]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], then [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Gérard Deschamps]]. The artist [[Christo]] joined the group in 1963.  The members of the group saw the world as an image, from which they would take parts and incorporate them into their works. They sought to bring life and art closer together, and has often been compared with ''[[Pop Art]]''. Yves Klein had nude women roll around in blue paint and throw themselves at canvases; Niki de Saint-Phalle created bloated and vibrant plastic figures; Arman gathered together found objects in boxed or resin-coated assemblages; [[César Baldaccini]] produced a series of large compressed object-sculptures (similar to Chamberlain's crushed automobiles); Daniel Spoerri used meals and food as artsistic material.

Associated in various ways with New Realism, the artists of the international [[Fluxus]] movement &amp;ndash; named and loosely organized in 1962 by [[George Maciunas]] (1931–78), a [[Lithuania]]n-born [[United States|American]] artist &amp;ndash; encouraged a [[do it yourself]] aesthetic, and valued simplicity over complexity. Like [[Dada]] before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an [[anti-art]] sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues. Outsourcing part of the creative process to commercial fabricators was not usually part of Fluxus practice. The most significant French Fluxus artist, [[Ben Vautier]] incorporated [[graffiti]] and found objects into his work.

Other artist in the period include [[Victor Vasarely]] who invented [[Op-Art]] by designing sophisticated optical patterns.

In May 1968, the radical youth movement, through their ''atelier populaire'', produced a great deal of poster-art protesting the moribund policies of president [[Charles de Gaulle]].

==Contemporary art in France==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Many contemporary artists continue to be haunted by the horrors of the war and the specter of the holocaust. [[Christian Boltanski]]'s harrowing installations of the lost and the anonymous are particularly powerful.

The work of his wife [[Annette Messager]], who represented France at the 2005 Venice Biennale, deals with issues of identity and feminism.

The photographer, installation artist and conceptual artist [[Sophie Calle]]'s work is distinguished by its use of arbitrary sets of constraints, and evokes the French literary movement of the 1960s known as [[Oulipo]]. Her work frequently depicts human vulnerability, and examines identity and intimacy. She is recognized for her detective-like ability to follow strangers and investigate their private lives. Her photographic work often includes panels of text of her own writing.

Beginning in the 1980s, the [[Figuration Libre]] movement was constituted around French figures like [[Remi Blanchard]], [[François Boisrond]], [[Robert Combas]], [[Hervé Di Rosa]], [[Richard Di Rosa]] and [[Louis Jammes]]. Between 1982 and 1985, these artists exhibited on several occasions with their American counterparts: [[Keith Haring]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Kenny Scharf]], [[Tseng Kwong Chi]] and inter alia, Crash (exhibitions in New York, London, Pittsburgh, and Paris). The Figuration Libre falls under the prolongation of artists and historical movements whose specificity was the opening to marginalized forms of expression, as the [[Cubism]] had opened with [[African art]] and [[Oceanic art]] (amongst other influences), and "[[Outsider Art|art brut]]" with the children's drawings, [[Pop art]] with advertising and comic strips.

[[Pierre et Gilles]] (Pierre Commoy and Gilles Blanchard), are gay French artistic and romantic partners. They produce highly stylized [[photograph]]s, building their own sets and costumes as well as retouching the photographs. Their work often features images from [[popular culture]], [[gay culture]] including [[porn]] (especially [[James Bidgood (filmmaker)|James Bidgood]]), and [[religion]].

Other important contemporary French artists include Jean-Pierre Raynaud, [[Orlan]], [[Ernest Pignon-Ernest]], [[Daniel Buren]], [[Jean-Marc Bustamante]], [[Pierre Huyghe]], Valérie Mréjen.

The '''56 Group Wales''' ({{lang-cy|'''Grŵp 56 Cymru'''}}) is an artists' organisation founded in [[Wales]] in 1956, with the aim of promoting Welsh [[Modernist]] art and artists.&lt;ref name="50 years"&gt;Peter Wakelin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aXYySHER7x8C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Arthur+Giardelli&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xFpTT5i_EKOA0AXpzLDpCw&amp;ved=0CF8QuwUwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Arthur%20Giardelli&amp;f=false "50 years of the Welsh Group"], National Museum of Wales (1999), {{ISBN|0-7200-0472-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was originally simply the '''56 Group''': "Wales" was added in 1967, in response to a feeling that the organisation's "Welsh origins ought to be re-affirmed".&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Welsh language|Welsh-language]] version of the name was first used on publicity in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The post-war art establishment in Wales was still very conservative and moves had been afoot since the late 1930s to create a modern art group.&lt;ref name="50 years 14"&gt;Peter Wakelin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aXYySHER7x8C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Arthur+Giardelli&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xFpTT5i_EKOA0AXpzLDpCw&amp;ved=0CF8QuwUwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Arthur%20Giardelli&amp;f=false "50 years of the Welsh Group"], National Museum of Wales (1999), pp. 14-15, {{ISBN|0-7200-0472-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1956, following a failed attempt to become a ''South Wales Academy of Art'', a "rebellion" took place within the ranks of the ''[[The Welsh Group|South Wales Group]]'' and the ''56 Group'' was established.&lt;ref name="50 years 39"&gt;Peter Wakelin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aXYySHER7x8C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Arthur+Giardelli&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xFpTT5i_EKOA0AXpzLDpCw&amp;ved=0CF8QuwUwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Arthur%20Giardelli&amp;f=false "50 years of the Welsh Group"], National Museum of Wales (1999), pp. 39-43, {{ISBN|0-7200-0472-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists [[Eric Malthouse]], [[David Tinker (artist)|David Tinker]] and [[Michael Edmonds (artist)|Michael Edmonds]] were the leading instigators. They circulated a statement of purpose and aims and an invitation to join the group to ten leading Welsh artists.

{{cquote|That painters and sculptors believe in a positive and dynamic approach which is aware of the tradition of the past and its fulfilment in the Art of the present. 

That the first aims of painting and sculpture lie in the integration of design and emotion; the search for a powerful image that transcends the everyday world around us. 

That the effect of environment is deeper and more all-embracing than the fortuitous mimicry of everyday surroundings. The painter and sculptor consciously seek a place to work where he feels at home. |author=Eric Malthouse, David Tinker and Michael Edmonds |source=''The 56 Group'': statement of purpose, 1956&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Of those invited to join, nine accepted: Trevor Bates, [[Hubert Dalwood]], George Fairley, [[Arthur Giardelli]], Robert Hunter, [[Heinz Koppel]], [[Will Roberts]], John Wright and [[Ernest Zobole]].&lt;ref name="Art in Wales"&gt;Eric Rowan, "Art in Wales: An Illustrated History 1850 - 1980", University of Wales Press, Cardiff (1985), pp. 125-129. {{ISBN|0-7083-1408-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brenda Chamberlain (artist)|Brenda Chamberlain]], the only female artist invited, declined.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, pp. 7, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although all twelve of the founder-members worked in a broadly modernist and internationalist idiom, they did not share a recognisably common style or ideology. Their average age was 36; and ten worked as [[Art education|art lecturers]] (Roberts and Edmonds did not). Only two, Roberts and Zobole, had been born in Wales: Fairley was born in [[Scotland]], Koppel in [[Germany]] and the others in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The 56 Group has always been essentially an exhibiting association of artists who retain their own independence and individuality. The group's first exhibition was held at [[Worcester]] Museum and Art Gallery in June 1957, and versions of the same exhibition were held later the same year at the [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum of Wales]] and [[Tenby]] Civic Centre.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently exhibited widely in both Wales and England. Its first continental exhibition was held in [[Amsterdam]] in 1967, and later exhibitions went to [[Nantes]] in 1974–5, [[Bologna]] in 1983, [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1986–7 and again in 1991, and [[Libramont-Chevigny|Libramont]], Belgium, in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, pp. 22, 38, 58–9, 64–5, 69, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; An exhibition of modern Welsh art held at the [[Jefferson Place Gallery]], [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1965, although not formally associated with the Group, included work by several of its members.&lt;ref name="Art in Wales" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, the Group's 56th anniversary year, it could claim to have had a total of 88 full members (plus a number of guest, associate and honorary members);&lt;ref&gt;Full listings of the membership appear in Moore 2012, pp. 88–91.&lt;/ref&gt; and to have held 225 exhibition showings.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 86. A full listing of exhibitions appears in Moore 2012, pp. 92–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Painter, sculptor and teacher [[Arthur Giardelli]] was the chair of the Group from 1961 to 1998. Some of its success – exhibitions and tours outside Wales – have been attributed to his language skills and European outlook.&lt;ref name="Giardelli Guardian"&gt;David Moore, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/nov/11/arthur-giardelli-obituary Arthur Giardelli obituary], ''The Guardian'' (London), 11 November 2009. Retrieved 2012-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, pp. 11, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, marking the 56th anniversary of the group's formation, a touring exhibition visited galleries around Wales. Called ''The 56 Group Wales: The Founders'', it includes artworks of the twelve original founders, as well as work from current members.&lt;ref name="WM three new shows"&gt;Nathan Bevan, [http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/arts-in-wales/2012/04/02/radical-post-war-arts-collective-the-56-group-returns-in-three-new-shows-91466-30671922/2/ 'Radical post-war arts collective the 56 Group returns in three new shows'], Western Mail, 2 April 2012. Retrieved 2012-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt; For the previous ten years, businessman Barrie Maskell had spent time tracking down and purchasing work made by each of the twelve original members. This included a visit to one of the surviving founders, John Wright, who was living in Spain.&lt;ref name="WM three new shows" /&gt; Fifty-six of Maskell's paintings were chosen for the exhibition. The exhibition was shown at venues in Pontypridd, Cardiff and [[MOMA, Wales|MOMA Wales]] in [[Machynlleth]].&lt;ref name="WM three new shows" /&gt; In the same year, a history of the Group's first 56 years by David Moore was published.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 a touring exhibition of the group's work, ''56:56'', opened at Newport Art Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.yudu.com/Library/A20nlz/SouthWalesArgusGuide/resources/7.htm 'Art tour celebrates 56 years'], ''South Wales Argus'', 11 January 2013. Retrieved 9 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The Group's activities have not always been eulogised. [[Will Roberts]], one of the founder members, who was afterwards (in 1964) asked to withdraw from exhibitions because his work was seen as insufficiently radical, later dismissed the Group as having been "set up by art school teachers who wanted to sell their work".&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; When Rollo Charles, keeper of art at the National Museum of Wales, commented in 1976 that the Group "is now generally regarded as the official avant garde of Welsh art", critic Bryn Richards responded "[t]his must seem to those who founded the group, with such hope, as a veritable kiss of death".&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Renowned Welsh artist [[Kyffin Williams]] was reported in 1981 to have had a strong antipathy for what he described as a group of "predominantly abstract painters or English [[carpetbagger]]s, ... who came down to Wales because they could not make it in the metropolis. The 56 Group has taken over Welsh art, and he [Williams] is out of favour in his homeland as a result."&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2012, p. 54: quoting "Painting: Kyffin Williams", ''Avant Garde'', Spring/Summer 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfred Clint''' (1807–1883) was an English marine painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bryan's dictionary of painters and engravers|author=Bryan, Michael|authorlink=Michael Bryan (art historian)|author2=Williamson, George C.|chapter=Clint, Alfred|volume=vol. 1, A-C|year=1903|location=NY|publisher=Macmillan|page=303|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r8VHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Clint was the fifth and youngest son by the first marriage of [[George Clint]], [[Associate of the Royal Academy|A.R.A.]] He was born in Alfred Place, [[Bedford Square]], London, on 22 March 1807.

He acquired the technical knowledge of painting from his father, while he studied from the life at a students' society, which met first in [[Drury Lane]] and afterwards in the Savoy. In early life he painted portraits and landscapes. He exhibited for the first time in 1828 at the [[British Institution]], sending in the folio wins year a 'Study from Nature' to the [[Royal Academy]]. In 1831 he began to exhibit at the [[Society of British Artists]]. He became a member of the society in 1843 and secretary from 1853 to 1859. He succeeded [[Frederick Yeates Hurlstone]] as president in 1869 and continued to fill that office until 1881.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Clint, Alfred|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best known as a marine painter, the subjects of his pictures taken chiefly from the [[English Channel]], and especially from Jersey, Guernsey, and the coast of Sussex. They were very popular, and some of them have been engraved. Between 1828 and 1879 he contributed 402 works to the exhibitions of the Royal Academy, British Institution, and the Society of British Artists. He drew and etched the illustrations to [[George John Bennett]]'s ''Pedestrian's Guide through North Wales'', 1838, and in 1856 wrote ''Landscape from Nature'', the second part of John Samuelson Templeton's ''Guide to Oil Painting''.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Clint died in Lancaster Road, [[Notting Hill]], London, on his birthday, 22 March 1883, at the age of 76, after having for about five years relinquished the pursuit of art owing to failing eyesight. He was buried in the same grave as his father, in [[Kensal Green]] cemetery. His remaining works were sold by Messrs. Christie, Manson, &amp; Woods in February 1884.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Alserkal Avenue''' is an industrial compound hosting warehouses in the industrial zone of [[Al Quoz]], in [[Dubai]].  Recently the area has become an arts and culture district for Dubai with lineup of galleries, facilities and platforms, such as Alserkal Avenue that houses residencies for local and global artists.&lt;ref&gt;Imran Mojib, [http://gulftoday.ae/portal/851df4ed-d19e-495a-8622-675734239ba9.aspx "Cultural district expansion to transform emirate’s cultural landscape"], ''[[The Gulf Today]]'', March 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/788441/boom-times-are-back-in-dubai-with-a-new-museum-opera-house-and|title=Boom Times Are Back in Dubai, With a New Museum, Opera House, and Cultural District in the Works|last=Zara|first=Janelle|date=March 23, 2012|website=Artinfo|access-date=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8231d4ce-a741-11e6-8898-79a99e2a4de6|title=Emirati artists and designers find inspiration close to home|last=Mohammad|first=Arsalan|date=December 10, 2016|work=Financial Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, Alserkal Avenue inaugurated [[Concrete (Alserkal Avenue)]], its new space in the Avenue and the first project to be completed in the [[United Arab Emirates]] by the [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture]] (OMA), founded by [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]] Laureate [[Rem Koolhaas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Eleanor|title=OMA's first project in Dubai is a cultural centre with moving eight-metre-high walls|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2017/03/16/concrete-oma-cultural-events-alserkal-avenue-dubai-united-arab-emirates/|website=Dezeen, March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Originally an industrial area consisting of thirty-nine warehouses, the district evolved naturally, with the first gallery, Ayyam Gallery, moving into the district in 2008. The original warehouses have since been converted into [[Art museum|art galleries]], design studios, a private museum and a [[performing arts]] space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=Colin|title=Dubai Art District to Double in Size|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/dubai-art-district-to-double-in-size|publisher=''The National'', March 21, 2013.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Carbon 12 Dubai, one of the most active [[contemporary art]] galleries of the region, moved to Alserkal Avenue in October 2009, other galleries followed, and the industrial compound's function evolved to become a "focal point of artistic activity."&lt;ref&gt;Ali Khaled, [http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/industrial-citys-art-scene-is-picture-of-vibrancy "Industrial city's art scene is picture of vibrancy"], ''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'', May 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alserkal Avenue is now a mix of industrial business and creative spaces. It now houses more than 60 art, design and creative venues that include foundations, private collections and community projects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is home to twenty-five contemporary art galleries and arts spaces in a one-block radius, the highest concentration of art galleries in one area in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson-Powell|first=Georgina|title=Dubai's Industrial Arts Scene|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/blog/20121107-dubais-industrial-arts-scene|publisher=''BBC Travel'', November 20, 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galleries in Alserkal Avenue are distinct and characterized by individual programs that represent emerging, mid-career and established artists as well as hosting exhibitions, talks, panel discussions, young collector’s auctions and community events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suleiman|first=Nahda|title=Common Ground|url=http://www.brownbook.me/common-ground-2/|publisher=Brownbook, September 8, 2012|access-date=2013-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218115555/http://brownbook.me/common-ground-2/|archive-date=2013-12-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, the area's developer, [[Abdelmonem Bin Eisa Alserkal]], announced plans to double the size of the art district, adding 62 units of varying sizes to the existing 39, and also adding an events centre and additional parking, giving the district a total area of {{convert|92000|m2|sqft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Simpson, [http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/dubai-art-district-to-double-in-size, "Dubai Art District to Double in Size"], ''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'', March 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  By September 2012 Alserkal Avenue had 20 art spaces&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Yusuf, [http://gulftoday.ae/portal/8fefe7ee-8751-456b-8337-80f56893f52f.aspx, "New Avenue for Art'], "[http://gulftoday.ae/portal/B6EF085D-6629-4C22-BDBD-A19A187413B5.aspx Gulf Today]", September 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Al Quoz neighborhood had a total of 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=D'Souza|first=Carolina|title=Retracing the Al Quoz Art Trail|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/heritage-culture/retracing-the-al-quoz-art-trail-1.1039117|publisher=''Gulf News''}} June 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion was completed in 2015, doubling Alserkal's square footage to about 500,000. The same year, it launched is programming arm to support local talent, focusing primarily on artists from the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Oztaskin|first=Murat|title=Will Dubai’s Alserkal Avenue be the Middle East’s Next Great Art Hub?|date=January 25, 2017|url=https://www.departures.com/art-culture/alserkal-avenue-arts-district-dubai|magazine=Departures|publisher=TimeInc|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two contemporary art galleries from the district, Gallery Isabelle van den Eynde and Green Art Gallery, were selected to participate in [[Art Basel]] in the ''Art Statements'' section, "for the first time in the history of the region".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hewett|first=Jenny|title=Alserkal Avenue in Dubai Focus|url=http://www.timeoutdubai.com/art/features/35569-alserkal-avenue-in-dubai-focus|publisher=''Timeout Dubai''}} February 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bradshaw rock paintings, Bradshaw rock art, Bradshaw figures''' or '''The Bradshaws,''' are terms used to describe one of the two major regional traditions of [[rock art]] found in the north-west [[Kimberley region of Western Australia]].&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;McNiven, Ian and Russell, Lynette ''Appropriated Pasts: Indigenous Peoples And The Colonial Culture Of Archaeology'' [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Rowman Altamira]] 2005 {{ISBN|9780759109070}} p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The identity of who painted these figures and the age of the art are contended within [[archaeology]] and amongst Australian rock art researchers.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal | last = [[Claire Smith|Smith]] | first = Claire | date =  November 2006 | title = The appropriation of Indigenous images: a review essay  | journal = [[Rock Art Research]] | volume = 23 | issue = 2|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects have been debated since the works were first discovered and recorded by [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]] [[Joseph Bradshaw (pastoralist)|Joseph Bradshaw]] in 1891, after whom they were named.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Daniel Sutherland ''Aboriginal Australian and Tasmanian Rock Carvings and Paintings'' [[Hesperian Press]] ([[American Philosophical Society]]) 2011 [1936] {{ISBN|9780859053754}} p. 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Kimberley is home to various Aboriginal language groups, the rock art is referred to and known by many different Aboriginal names, the most common of which are ''Gwion Gwion''&lt;ref name="Doring"&gt;Doring, Jeff ''Gwion Gwion: Chemins Secrets Et Sacrés Des Ngarinyin, Aborigènes D'Australie'' (Gwion Gwion: Secret and Sacred Pathways of the Ngarinyin Aboriginal People of Australia), Könemann 2000 {{ISBN|9783829040600}} p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Giro Giro.''&lt;ref&gt;Worms, Ernest ''Contemporary and prehistoric rock paintings in Central and Northern North Kimberley'' Anthropos Switzerland 1955 p. 555&lt;/ref&gt; The art consists primarily of human figures ornamented with accessories such as bags, [[tassel]]s and headdresses.&lt;ref name="Don"&gt;Donaldson, Mike [https://www.scribd.com/doc/62208928/Bradshaw-Figures-in-Cave-Art ''The Gwion or Bradshaw art style of Australia’s Kimberley region is undoubtedly among the earliest rock art in the country –but is it Pleistocene?''] (free download) ''L’art pléistocène en Australie (Pré-Actes)'',  [[International Federation of Rock Art Organizations|IFRAO]] Congress, September 2010 p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and study==

[[File:Wandjina rock art.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Indigenous Australian rock art in the later Wandjina style]] 
Rock art in the Kimberley region was first recorded by the explorer and future South Australian governor, Sir [[George Grey]] as early as 1838.&lt;ref name="grey"&gt;{{cite book | last =Grey | first = George | year =1841  | title =  Journals of Two Expeditions | publisher =  Government Printer | location =  vol.1, p. 263| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rock art is now known as [[Wondjina|Wandjina]] style art.

While searching for suitable pastoral land in the then remote [[Roe River (Western Australia)|Roe River]] area in 1891, pastoralist Joseph Bradshaw discovered an unusual type of rock art on a [[sandstone]] escarpment.&lt;ref name="Brad"&gt;{{cite web | last =  Clement | first =  Cathie | date =  | title =  Joseph Bradshaw – Getting Lost in the Kimberley and The Art Named After Him | work = Kimberley society | url = http://www.kimberleysociety.org/oldfiles/2008/JOSEPH%20BRADSHAW%20Oct%2008.pdf | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradshaw recognised that this style of painting was unique when compared to the Wandjina style. In a subsequent address to the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] branch of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], he commented on the fine detail, the colours, such as brown, yellow and pale blue, and he compared it aesthetically to that of [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name="bradin"&gt;{{cite book | last =  Bradshaw | first =  Joseph | year = 2010 | title =  Lost World of the Kimberley: Extraordinary New Glimpses of Australia's Ice Age Ancestors | publisher =  Allen &amp; Unwin | location =  p. 18-19| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American archaeologist Daniel Sutherland Davidson briefly commented on Bradshaw's figures while undertaking a survey of Australian rock art that he would publish in 1936. Davidson noted that Bradshaw's encounter with this art was brief and lacked any [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] interpretations; furthermore, as Bradshaw's sketches of the art were at this time the only visual evidence, Davidson argued that they could be inaccurate and possibly drawn from a [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Davidson | first =  Sutherland Daniel | year = 2011 |origyear=1936 | title =  Aboriginal Australian and Tasmanian Rock Carvings and Paintings | publisher =  Hesperian Press | location =  p. 133.| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rediscovery of the original mural after more than a century has shown that Bradshaw had a remarkable gift for reproduction without photography, and that Davidson's criticisms were unfounded in the absence of the original.&lt;ref name = Rainsbury&gt;Rainsbury, Michael P  (2013) Mr Bradshaw's drawings': reassessing Joseph Bradshaw's sketches. Rock Art Research: The Journal of the Australian Rock Art Research Association (AURA) 2012  Volume 30 243-253&lt;/ref&gt; Bradshaw's figures and their existence as an artistic tradition was questioned; articles and books on these works were not published until the 1950s.&lt;ref name="shult"&gt;{{cite journal | last =  Schultz | first =  Agnes | year =  1956 | title =  North–west Australian rock paintings | journal =  Memoirs of the National Museum of Victoria | volume =  20| issue =  | pages =1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
With the growth of [[Anthropology|anthropological]] interest in Peninsula region, research in the coastal area brought with it an awareness of Aboriginal art and culture.&lt;ref name="elkin"&gt;{{cite journal | last =  Elkin | first =  Adolphus Peter | year =  1930| title =  Rock Paintings of North-West Australia | journal =  Oceania | volume =  1| issue =  3| pages =257–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, attention to the Bradshaw art was sporadic. Several researchers who encountered the Bradshaw-type of paintings during expeditions to the region were members of the 1938 [[Frobenius Institute]] expedition. Agnes Schultz noted that unlike with Wandjina art, Aboriginal people showed little interest in the Bradshaw paintings, although they recognised them as depictions of bush [[spirit]]s or ''D’imi.''

When pressed, the expedition's Aboriginal guide explained their creation:&lt;ref name="shult"/&gt;
{{quotation|Long ago Kujon a black bird, painted on the rocks. He struck his bill against the stones so that it Bleed, and with the blood he painted. He painted no animals, only human-shaped figures which probably represent spirits”.}}

Anthropologist Robert Layton notes that researchers such as Ian Crawford, who worked in the region in 1969, and Patricia Vinnicombe, who work in the region in the 1980s, were both told similar creation stories regarding the Bradshaw-type art.&lt;ref name="layton"&gt;{{cite book | last = Layton | first = Robert | year = 1991| title = Australian Rock Art: A New Synthesis | publisher =  Cambridge University Press | location =  p. 84| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1980, more systematic work has been done in an effort to identify more Bradshaw rock art sites in the Kimberley.&lt;ref name="eds"&gt;{{cite book |last= Crawford |first= Ian |editor-first= P.J. |editor-last= Ucko |title= Form in Indigenous Art |publisher= Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies |year=1977|pages=357–369|chapter= The relationship of Bradshaw art in north-west Kimberley |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="welcha"&gt;{{cite journal | last =  Welch | first =  David | year = 1990 | title =  The bichrome art period in the Kimberley, Australia | journal =  Rock Art Research | volume =  7| issue =  | pages =  110–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" welchb"&gt;{{cite journal | last =  Welch | first =  David | year = 1993 | title =  Early 'naturalistic' human figures in the Kimberley Australia | journal =  Rock Art Research | volume =  10| issue = 1 | pages = 24–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;{{cite book | last =  Walsh | first =  Grahame | year =  1994| title =  Bradshaws: ancient rock paintings of north-west Australia | publisher =  Geneva: Édition Limitée | location =  | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable has been the work undertaken by amateur archaeologist [[Grahame Walsh]], who began work there in 1977 and returned to record and locate new sites up until his death in 2007. The results of this work produced a database of 1.5 million rock art images and recordings of 1,500 new rock art sites.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web | publisher =  ABC | date =  15 October 2002| title = Rock Heart | work =  Australian Story | url =  http://www.abc.net.au/austory/transcripts/s696261.htm  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded his records by studying [[superimposition]] and style sequences of the paintings to establish a [[chronology]] that demonstrated that ''Bradshaw art'' is found early in the Kimberley rock art sequence. He proposed that the art dated to a period prior to the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name="walsh"/&gt;
Many of the ancient rock paintings maintain vivid colours because they have been colonised by bacteria and fungi, such as the black fungus, ''[[Chaetothyriales]].'' The pigments originally applied may have initiated an ongoing, [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship between black fungi and red bacteria.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = BBC | date = 27 December 2010| title =  Ancient rock art's colours come from microbes | work =  BBC News | url =  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12039203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bradshaw art==
Based on stylistic characteristics, Walsh categorised two individual styles of ‘Bradshaw paintings’, which he named ‘Tassel’ and ‘Sash’ for dominant clothing features. He also identified two variants, which he named ‘Elegant Action figures’ and ‘Clothes Peg figures’.&lt;ref name="walsh"/&gt;
[[File:Bradshaw rock art traditions.jpg|right|450px|thumb|Drawings from Bradshaw rock paintings in the Kimberley region of Western Australia depicting the four traditional styles (resized for comparison).]]           
*'''Tassel figures:''' identified by their characteristic tassels hanging from their arms and waists, various other accessories can be recognised, such as arm bands, conical headdresses and [[Boomerangs]].&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt; This style is the earliest, most detailed and largest.&lt;ref name="Coukell"/&gt;
*'''Sash:''' while similar in appearance to the ''Tassel'' figures, the ''Sash'' body is depicted more robustly and the accoutrements depicted are slightly different: a three-pointed sash or bags attached to the figures belts begin to be shown.&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt;
*'''Elegant Action Figures:''' quite different from the ''Tassel'' and ''Sash'' figures, these figures are almost always shown running, kneeling or hunting with multi-barbed [[spear]]s and boomerangs.&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt; These are difficult to place in the style sequence as they are the only figures that are not superimposed over a painting from another period. Also, no other style is superimposed over them and they are the only style that has not been defaced. Stylistically, they are believed to fall between the ''sash'' and ''Clothes Peg'' Figures.&lt;ref name="Coukell"/&gt;
*'''Clothes Peg Figures:''' were named by Walsh after their resemblance to old [[Clothespin|wooden clothes pegs]],&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt; but they are also referred to as ''Straight Part Figures'' by Welch.&lt;ref name="welcha"/&gt; These figures are depicted in a stationary pose and painted with red pigment. Segments of their bodies are missing, such as their waists, arms and feet, the result of different colour pigments, such as whites and yellows, fading over time. The material culture depicted with these figures includes multi-barbed spears, [[spear-thrower]]s, and woven bags. This is the most recent style.&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt; The anatomical detail common in the earlier styles is missing, and many of the images are shown in aggressive stances. At least one panel shows a battle with opponents arrayed in ranks opposite each other.&lt;ref name="Coukell"/&gt;

The distribution and stylistic range of these paintings is quite distinctive, and contrasts with the Wandjina tradition. While more common in some areas, such as the sandstone regions of the west and central Kimberley, isolated examples have also been found in several scattered locations in the east, such as the [[Napier Range]]s, and at the far eastern border of the Kimberley.&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt;&lt;ref name="date"/&gt; The art is primarily painted where a suitable [[rock shelter]] is found; in contrast with Wandjina art, which has a limited distribution restricted to isolated sites.&lt;ref name="eds"/&gt; Unlike Wandjina, Bradshaw art is rarely found on ceilings, rather vertical rock surfaces are used, high up in escarpments in shallower rock shelters with small overhangs and with irregular rocky floors not suitable for occupation.&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt;

[[File:Kimberley.png|right|250px|thumb|The Kimberley region of Western Australia.]]
The Bradshaw paintings predominantly depict human silhouette figures that appear to be suspended in the air or in a dynamic style that suggests running, hunting or dancing.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt; While gender is rarely portrayed in the paintings, limb, arm and shoulder muscles are often well defined in addition to stomach paunches. The question of gender representation in Bradshaw art was illuminated recently by the discovery that figures are depicted as if they are facing into the rock face.&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Virtue, L. (2012). Rock art of forgotten people. An interdisciplinary workshop about rock art in the Kimberley region, Australia: Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg, Delmenhorst, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective has been overlooked until now because of the Western bias toward images that “face out”, but also because the “facing in” perspective is more evident in depictions with excellent delineation of body contours, such as the rare, Classic Realistic style, which is also earliest in superposition studies;&lt;ref&gt;: |url = http://bradshawrockart.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;). If one appreciates the “facing in” perspective, it becomes evident that the many attributions of “paunches’ by&lt;ref name = "Walsh"&gt;Walsh G.  (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; are incorrect, both because they can now be seen to be located at the rear of these figures, but also because it is anatomically incorrect to attribute the belly to gluteal structures located more inferiorly.&lt;ref name="Walsh, G."&gt;(2000) Bradshaw Art of the Kimberley. Toowong: Takarakka Nowan Kas Publications&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the figures are ornamented with a diversity of objects such as belts, headdresses, bags and tassels, while other material culture is sometimes depicted, such as [[boomerang]]s and [[wand]]s. While Bradshaw initially described the colour of the art as having shades of pale blue and yellow, most figures have a deep purple-red hue, mulberry colour or a red to yellow-brown colour. However, Donaldson notes that there are rare examples of multi-coloured figures that retain some yellow and white pigment. The height of the art is variable; most are between 40 and 50&amp;nbsp;cm in length with some examples up to 2 metres in height.&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt;

Artistically, Bradshaws are unusually advanced both in technique and style. Image processing has revealed that the outline of the Bradshaw figures are often painted first, then filled in. Engraving in the rock often follows the outlines of figures and may have served as a preliminary sketch which implies planning. Some faces of the figures are painted with anatomically correct features with enough detail to be considered portraits.&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt; Due to the fine detail and control found in the images, such as strands of hair painted in 1-2mm thicknesses, it has been suggested that feather [[quill]]s may have been used as a technique to apply the paint to the rock walls; an imprint of a feather found at one site may support this possibility.&lt;ref name="eds"/&gt; No evidence has yet been found of any corrections or changes in composition during or after painting, while evidence of restoration have been found. In a detailed study of 66 Bradshaw panels, approximately 9% of the Bradshaw images have clearly been vandalized. Some were scratched with stones, some damaged by thrown stones, and some have been broken by hammering with large rocks.

With the exception of Elegant Action Figures which have been left undamaged for unknown reasons, all Bradshaw paintings exhibit possible vandalism, which may indicate ritual mutilation or defacing. Superpositioning of images, another form of vandalism, is common throughout the Kimberley.&lt;ref name="H2"&gt;{{cite web | last1  = Biro | first1 = P.P.| last2  = Ebersole | first2 = T.W.| last3  = Tasja | first3 = W.| last4  = Michaelsen | first4 = P.| last5  = Smith | first5 = N.W.| date = January 2000 | title = Australian ice age rock art may depict Earth's oldest recordings of Shamanistic rituals| work = [[Mankind Quarterly]] | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-69880845.html| accessdate = 2 January 2013 | via = [[HighBeam Research]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;{{cite web | last1  = Biro | first1 = P.P.| last2  = Ebersole | first2 = T.W.| last3  = Felder | first3 = M.A.J.| last4  = Jensen | first4 = I.B. | last5  = Michaelsen | first5 = P.| last6  = Smith | first6 = M.W.| last7  = Von Liptak | first7 = P.| date = June 2001 | title = An initial investigation into aspects of preservation potential of the Bradshaw rock-art system, Kimberley, northwestern Australia.| work = [[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76283789.html | accessdate = 2 January 2013 | via = [[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
The Bradshaws are not the regions' earliest paintings. The earlier art consists of crude animal drawings that are believed to be up to 40,000 years old. The Bradshaws have nothing in common with this earlier art and first appeared following the peak of the most recent [[Last Glacial Maximum|Pleistocene glacial maximum]], which is dated between 26,500 and 20,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Coukell"/&gt;

Since the mid-1990s, scientific dating methods have been used to determine the ages of the Bradshaw paintings. The methods have included, [[Accelerator mass spectrometry]] radiocarbon dating (AMS) and [[Optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL). This was used when [[Mud dauber|mud wasp]] nests have been built over paintings, and it gives a minimum age rather than an actual age of the painting. The results of this have revealed some inconsistency with Walsh's chronology. Experimental OSL dates from a wasp nest overlaying a tassel Bradshaw figure has given a Pleistocene date of 17,500±1,800 years [[Before Present|BP]]. The academic community generally accepts 5,000 BP for the end of the artistic style. If the date ranges are correct, this may demonstrate that the Bradshaw tradition was produced for many [[Millennium|millennia]].&lt;ref name="date"&gt;{{Citation| last1  = Tacon | first1 = Paul| last2  = Mulvaney | first2 = Ken| last3  = Fullagar | first3 = Richard| last4  = Head | first4 = Lesley | title   = Bradshaws' – an eastern province? | journal = Rock Art Research | volume  = 16| issue   = 2| pages   = 127–129| year   = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoarchaeology|Geoarchaeologist]], Alan Watchman posits that the red paint used on a tasselled Bradshaw image near the [[Drysdale River]] is "likely to be only about 3,000 years old."&lt;ref&gt;Watchman 1997: 42&lt;/ref&gt; Using the AMS results from accreted paint layers containing carbon associated with another figure, gives a date of 3,880 BP&lt;ref&gt;1997:44; cf. Michaelson 2000&lt;/ref&gt; making Bradshaw art contemporaneous with, and no older than, Wanjina art.&lt;ref name="H3"&gt;{{cite web | last = Redmond| first = Anthony| date = 22 September 2002| title = 'Alien abductions', Kimberley Aboriginal rock-paintings, and the speculation about human origins: on some investments in cultural tourism in the northern Kimberley.| work = [[Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies]] | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-127621957.html| accessdate = 2 January 2013 | via = [[HighBeam Research]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 15,000 years ago, the archaeological record shows that Aboriginals in the Kimberleys began using stone points in place of multi-barbed spears, but there is no record of this change of technology in the Bradshaw paintings. The most recent paintings still depict the use of multi-barbed spears.&lt;ref name="Coukell"/&gt;

In 2008, rock art depicting what is thought to be a [[Thylacoleo]] was discovered on the north-western coast of the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]]. This represented only the second example of megafauna depicted by the Indigenous inhabitants of Australia. The image has a "clothes peg" Bradshaw superimposed over the thorax, while a "Tassel" Bradshaw crosses the forearm of the animal.&lt;ref name="Willing"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Akerman | first1 = Kim | last2  = Willing | first2 = Tim| date = March 2009 | title = An ancient rock painting of a marsupial lion, Thylacoleo carnifex, from the Kimberley, Western Australia | work = [[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]| url = http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/akerman319/ | accessdate = 11 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a second image was found that depicts a thylacoleo interacting with an "elegant action" Bradshaw who is in the act of spearing or fending the animal off with a multibarbed spear. Much smaller and less detailed than the 2008 find, it may depict a [[thylacine]] however, the comparative size and morphology indicates a thylacoleo is more likely, a position supported by [[palaeontology|palaeontologists]] and archaeologists who have examined the image.&lt;ref name="Akerman"&gt;{{cite web | last = Akerman | first = Kim | date = December 2009 | title = Interaction between humans and megafauna depicted in Australian rock art? | work = [[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] | url = http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/akerman322/ | accessdate = 11 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Thylacoleo is believed to have become extinct 45,000–46,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie 2004&lt;/ref&gt; this suggests a similar age for the associated Bradshaw art. Archaeologist Kim Akerman however believes that the megafauna may have persisted later in wetter areas of the continent as suggested by Wells,&lt;ref&gt;1985: 228&lt;/ref&gt; and has suggested an age of 15,000 to 22,000 years for the paintings.&lt;ref name="Akerman"/&gt;

Recent advances in dating methods may shed light on the age of the paintings and gain a more accurate result. [[Neuroscience|Neuroscientist]] [[Jack Pettigrew]] has proposed dating the art by using [[DNA sequencing]] extracted from colonies of [[microorganism]]s which have replaced the [[pigment]] in some paintings.&lt;ref name="peti"&gt;{{Citation| last1  = Pettigrew, | first1 = Jack| last2  = Callistemon | first2 = Chloe| last3  = Weiler | first3 = Astrid| last4  = Gorbushina | first4 = Anna | last5  =  Krumbein | first5 = Wolfgang | last6 =  Weiler | first6 = Reto | title   = Living Pigments in Australian Bradshaw Rock Art | journal = Antiquity | volume  = 84| issue   = |page=326| year   = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
[[Image:Sunda shelf.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Map showing the probable extent of land at the time of the last glacial maximum 25,000 to 15,000 years ago]]
The fossil record of climate and vegetation at the Last Glacial Maximum is sparse, but still clear enough to provide an overview. When the Kimberley region was first occupied circa 40,000 years ago, the region consisted of [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|open tropical forests]] and [[woodland]]s. After around 10,000 years of stable climatic conditions, temperatures began cooling and winds became stronger, leading to the beginning of an ice-age. During the glacial maximum, 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, the sea level was some 140 metres below its present level, with the coastline extending 400 kilometres further to the north-west. Australia was connected to [[New Guinea]], and the Kimberley was separated from Southeast Asia (''[[Wallacea]]'') by a [[strait]] approximately 90&amp;nbsp;km wide.&lt;ref name="Coukell"/&gt; Rainfall decreased by 40% to 50% depending on region, while the lower CO2 levels (half pre-industrial levels) meant that vegetation required twice as much water to [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesize]].&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Luly et.al [http://epress.anu.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ch0616.pdf Last Glacial Maximum habitat change and its effects on the grey-headed flying fox] James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland&lt;/ref&gt; The Kimberley region, including the adjacent exposed continental [[Sahul Shelf]], was covered by vast grasslands, while woodlands and semi-arid scrub covered the shelf joining New Guinea to Australia.&lt;ref name="ENSO"/&gt; Southeast of the Kimberley, from the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] to northern [[Tasmania]] the land, including the western and southern margins of the now exposed continental shelves, was covered by extreme deserts and [[Dune|sand dunes]]. It is believed that no more than 15% of Australia supported trees of any kind. While some tree cover remained in the south/east of Australia, the vegetation of the wetter coastal areas in this region was semi-arid savannah. Tasmania was covered primarily by cold [[steppe]] and alpine grasslands, with snow pines at lower altitudes. There is evidence that there may have been a significant reduction in Australian Aboriginal populations during this time. It appears there were scattered [[Last Glacial Maximum refugia|"refugia"]] in which the modern vegetation types and human populations were able to survive.&lt;ref name="dodson"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dodson | first = J.R. | date = September 2001 | title = Holocene vegetation change in the Mediterranean-type climate regions of Australia | journal = The Holocene | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 673–680 | doi=10.1191/09596830195690}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Adams [http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nercAUSTRALASIA.html Australasia during The Last 150,000 Years] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226170218/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nercAUSTRALASIA.html# |date=26 February 2013 }} Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.H.Monroe [http://austhrutime.com/glacial_maximum_australia.htm Last Glacial Maximum in Australia] ''Australia: The Land Where Time Began: A biography of the Australian continent''&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of the ice-age, the Kimberley region settled into a [[tropical monsoon climate]] until a major [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] event in the mid Holocene caused the [[Monsoon#Australia|Australian summer monsoon]] rains to weaken or fail for some 1,500 years.&lt;ref name="ENSO"/&gt;

The discontinuity in artistic styles between the earlier Bradshaws and the current Wandjina has been attributed to the severe drought phase that followed the collapse of the wet season in 5,500 BP. The Bradshaw style art ended around this time, possibly within 500 years. The emergence of Wandjina art depicting cloud and rain spirits 3,800 to 4,000 years ago coincides with the end of the "mega-drought" and a return of the rain which gave the region its current climate. The research paper's lead author, [[Hamish McGowan]], suggests further investigation into the resulting cultural collapse and the possibility that another ethnic group supplanted the Bradshaw artists.&lt;ref name="ENSO"&gt;McGowan H, Marx S, Moss P, Hammond A. "Evidence of ENSO mega-drought triggered collapse of prehistory Aboriginal society in northwest Australia". ''GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,'' VOL. 39, L22702, 5 PP., 2012 doi:10.1029/2012GL053916 http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2012GL053916.shtml Evidence of ENSO mega-drought triggered collapse of prehistory Aboriginal society in northwest Australia&lt;/ref&gt; The chair in Kimberley rock art at the [[University of Western Australia]], Peter Veth, has critiqued the research paper for claiming that simultaneous changes in climate patterns and art styles indicates the collapse of a culture. Veth suggests that a climate change coinciding with the change from Bradshaw to Wandjina art is coincidence, pointing out that the [[archaeology]] of the Kimberley does not show a break in occupation, and that stylistic changes in Aboriginal art have occurred elsewhere in Australia. Additionally, the migration of a new ethnic group into the area is unsupported by the [[linguistics]].&lt;ref name="egan"&gt;{{cite web | last = Egan | first = Joanna | date = 18 December 2012 | title = Did mega-drought destroy Aboriginal culture? | work = [[Australian Geographic]] | url = http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/mega-drought-caused-demise-of-aboriginal-culture-study-says.htm | accessdate = 22 December 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121220122109/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/mega-drought-caused-demise-of-aboriginal-culture-study-says.htm | archivedate = 20 December 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous knowledge==
Research undertaken in relation to Aboriginal knowledge has also increased. This has primarily been seen in Aboriginal names being applied to the Bradshaw paintings, reflecting the specific Aboriginal languages used in the areas where they are found. For example, the [[Worrorran languages|Ngarinyin name]] for the art is ''Gwion Gwion''.&lt;ref name="Doring"/&gt; Other terms include ''giro giro'' used by Aboriginal people in the [[Napier Range|Napier]], [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome Bay]] and [[Prince Regent River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McCarthy | first = Frederick | title = Rock Art of the Cobar Pediplain in Central Western New South Wales | publisher = Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies | year = 1975| location = 75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian rock art researcher David Welch notes that these words are probably different regional [[Accent (dialect)|accent]]s of ''Kujon,'' the name of the bird found in the creation story originally heard by Schultz in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Welch |first= David |editor-first= M |editor-last= Donaldson | editor2-first= K.F.| editor2-last= Kenneally |title= Rock art of the Kimberley |publisher= Kimberley Society |year=2007|pages= 39–56 |chapter= Bradshaw art of the Kimberley |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aboriginal people are also more open in telling foreigners stories regarding the images. These stories often relate to spirits who created dances which are still performed today and feature similar apparel found in the paintings, such as headdresses, boomerangs and string.&lt;ref name="Doring"/&gt; ''Bradshaws (Gwion Gwion)'' are also depicted in contemporary art works produced for sale in the Kimberley; one notable ''Gwion Gwion'' artist is Kevin Waina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aboriginalartshop.com/artists/kevin-waina | title = Kevin Waina | publisher=Artlandish | accessdate= 4 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Research concerning Bradshaw art is controversial and little consensus has been reached. Debate has primarily concerned Walsh's interpretations regarding the origins, dating and ethnicity of the Bradshaw artists, and his rejection of Aboriginal people as being their descendants.&lt;ref name="mc"/&gt; The implications of his interpretations generated considerable criticism beginning in the mid 1990s due to its continuing potential to undermine [[Aboriginal title|native title]] claims in the Kimberley.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "AA"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "uwa"/&gt; The ongoing disagreements regarding the age of the art and debate about whether it was created by non-Indigenous people makes Bradshaw rock art one of Australian archaeology's most contentious topics.&lt;ref name= "uwa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Workshop to address contentious rock-art|url=http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201010142964/events/workshop-address-contentious-rock-art|website=University News|publisher=[[University of Western Australia]]|date = 14 October 2010 |accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robin&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanbury-Tenison|first1=Robin|title=Evidence of pre-aboriginal Australians?|url=http://www.dampierrockart.net/Media/2006-07-26%20Evidence%20of%20pre-aboriginal%20Australians-Times%20Online.pdf|website=Dampier Rock Art|publisher=[[The Times|Times Online]]|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exotic or local artists===
According to Walsh, Bradshaw art was associated with a period he called the ''Erudite Epoch'', a time before Aboriginal people populated Australia. He suggested that the art may be the product of an ethnic group who had likely arrived in Australia from [[Indonesia]], only to be displaced by the ancestors of present-day Aboriginal people. Walsh based this interpretation on the sophistication of Bradshaw art when compared to other art in the Kimberley region, such as the much later Wandjina styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Morwood | first = Mike | title = Ancient Paintings of Northwest Australia [Book Review]| journal = Australian Archaeology | volume = 43 |page=47 | year = 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Media coverage has at times emphasised his claims of mysterious races. Pettigrew suggests that the Bradshaw paintings depict people with ‘peppercorn curls’ and small stature that characterise [[San people|San]] groups; he speculates that African people travelled, shortly after the [[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba eruption]] some 70,000 years ago, by reed boat across the Indian Ocean, provisioning themselves with the fruit of the baobab tree.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Pettigrew. "Iconography in Bradshaw rock art: breaking the circularity", ''Clinical and Experimental Optometry'', Volume 94, Issue 5, pages 403–417, September 2011, first published online: 24 AUG 2011. DOI: 10.1111/j.1444-0938.2011.00648.x [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1444-0938.2011.00648.x/full]&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian archaeological community has generally not accepted such claims and believes that Bradshaw are indigenous works. For example, Dr Andree Rosenfeld argued that the aesthetics of the art did not support claims for a non-Aboriginal origin when comparison is made to the aesthetic value of contemporary Aboriginal art.&lt;ref name = "AA"&gt;{{Citation | title = Minutes of the 1995 Annual General Meeting of the Australian Archaeological Association | journal = Australian Archaeology | volume = 42 |page=59 | year = 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Archaeological Association]] in a press release stated, "No archaeological evidence exists which suggests that the early colonisation of Australia was by anyone other than the ancestors of contemporary Aboriginal people", the release quoted [[Claire Smith]]: "such interpretations are based on and encourage [[Racism|racist]] [[stereotype]]s".&lt;ref name = "AA"/&gt;

Aboriginal people also criticised Grahame Walsh, arguing that he failed to hear their explanations of the significance that the paintings had in their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Blundell |first1= Valda |last2=Woolagoodja|first2= Donny| editor-first= J.J. |editor-last= McDonald | editor2-first= M.M.| editor2-last= Veth |title= Companion to Rock Art |publisher= Malden: Wiley Blackwell |year=2012|pages=476–477|chapter= Rock Art, Aboriginal Culture, and Identity: The Wanjina Paintings of Northwest Australia |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford records being told by an Aboriginal elder in 1969 that the Bradshaws were "rubbish paintings", a quote that Walsh would repeat continually in support of his own theory that the art was not of Aboriginal origin. In the local [[Australian Aboriginal English|Indigenous English]], ''rubbish'' is an adjective usually used to describe someone who is too old or too young to be active in the local culture. Another use is meaning something is ''not dangerous,'' for example, non-poisonous snakes are all considered to be ''rubbish'' while in contrast, poisonous snakes are all ''cheeky.''&lt;ref name="H3"/&gt;

Scholars have generally rejected the idea that Bradshaw art was painted by anyone other than Aboriginal people. Statistical analysis undertaken by Michael Barry has concluded that the Bradshaw art shares no stylistic attributes with prehistoric [[figurative art]] overseas. Moreover, Barry argues that stylistically, Bradshaw art has more in common with art found elsewhere in Australia, such as figures painted in [[Arnhem Land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1= Barry |first1= Michael |last2= John Peter |first2= White | title = 'Exotic Bradshaws' or Australian 'Gwion': an archaeological test | journal = Australian Aboriginal Studies | volume = 2004 | issue = 1  |page=44 | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[popular history|popular historians]] and amateur researchers have continued to suggest exotic origins for the Bradshaw rock paintings, although these interpretations are considered fringe by reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1= Hanbury-Tenison |first1= Robin| title = An earlier start – Lost World of the Kimberley [review] |newspaper= The Times Literary Supplement | volume = |page=13 | date = 28 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depictions of shamanistic rituals===
In many cases, Tassel and Sash figures appear to be involved in either dancing, ecstatic behaviour, or both which, according to a study by Michaelson ''et al.,'' may represent [[shaman]]istic rituals or creation ceremonies. [[Eucalyptus]] leaves (which can be used as a [[psychoactive drug]]) are commonly depicted with Tassel and Sash figures that appear to be in motion.&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt;

Michaelson ''et al.'' cited studies by [[A. P. Elkin]] in which he argued that Aboriginal and [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] [[shamanism]] have markedly close similarities. He also noted that the worldwide pattern of shamanism suggests a common heritage that radiated outward from North Africa about 50,000 years ago; it may have originated as a woman's role which over time has been taken over by men. Aboriginal females in Australia have explicitly been recorded as saying that men had taken over roles they once performed in ceremonies. This is supported by many completely different languages having a similar word for female shamans (e.g., udaghan, udagan, utygan), while the term for male shamans is distinct in each language. Michaelson considered it significant that while few females are depicted in Bradshaw art, Tassel figures which appear to be leading ceremonies (the oldest art) clearly have breasts, in contrast to later art which depicts males in the leading roles.&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt; Pettigrew identifies elements of Bradshaw art with symbols used by [[Sandawe people|Sandawe]] artists to convey their experience with hallucinogens, and others that seem to show hallucinatory elements. From this he infers that psilocybin-induced trances were a feature of both cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Pettigrew. "Iconography in Bradshaw rock art: breaking the circularity". ''Clinical and Experimental Optometry'' Volume 94, Issue 5, pages 403–417, September 2011, first published online: 24 AUG 2011. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1444-0938.2011.00648.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, only a small number of researchers believe that shamanism has been part of the culture of Indigenous Australians. [[George Chaloupka]], an expert on Indigenous Australian rock art, puts it bluntly, "Shamaniacs rule the world at present...It's just another orthodoxy basking in its five minutes of sunshine." Grahame Walsh considered the idea of female shamans in the Bradshaw culture "preposterous". Pointing out that female Bradshaw images tend to have extremely prominent breasts, Walsh says that the smaller breasts identified by Michaelson are probably chest-band decorations.&lt;ref name="Coukell"&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Coukell | first =  Allan | date =  May 2001 | title =  Could mysterious figures lurking in Australian rock art be the world's oldest shamans? |magazine=  [[New Scientist]] | volume =  | issue =  |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destruction===
Aerial fire-bombing and [[Controlled burn|back burning]] by the Western Australian [[Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)|Department of Parks and Wildlife]] and the [[Department of Fire and Emergency Services]] since 2009 as part of the government's fire prevention strategy to aid the exploitation of oil and gas reserves has caused paint to peel from over 5,000 of the 8,742 known examples of Bradshaw art. A survey by archaeologist Lee Scott-Virtue has determined that up to 30 per cent of the rock art had been completely destroyed by fire.&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holland|first1=Steve|title='Negligent' burning in WA's north threatening rock art, homes|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/negligent-burning-in-was-north-threatening-rock-art-homes-20141201-11xuel.html|accessdate=15 May 2015|work=WA Today|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robin/&gt;

[[Image:Piling Lotus.JPG|thumb|Example of Chinese Piling painting from the Nantoyōsō Collection, Japan]]

The '''Piling School''' was a genre of [[Chinese painting]], named for its place of origin, now [[Changzhou]] in [[Jiangsu]] province. The style was influenced by contact with Japan, and examples are found almost exclusively in Japan and particularly in collections associated with the great Japanese [[Buddhist monasteries]].

==Origin==
Such paintings and associated art works are a reflection of the vigorous medieval overseas trade between China and Japan.

Piling ({{zh|c=毘陵/毗陵|p=pílíng|l=adjacent to hill (old Name of [[Changzhou]])}}) itself was a part of [[Changzhou]] close to [[Lake Tai]] in Jiangsu Province. Many other genre artists can be associated with this general area. Although their surviving works are few, the clear influence of their painting can be readily seen in shards of Yuan period blue-and-white porcelain from the [[Jingdezhen]] production area.

==Categorization==
Works of the Piling School may be rightly regarded as [[folk art|folk]] or popular works that have no association with named artists. An exception are the [[hanging scroll]]s in the  [[Chion-in Monastery]] collection in [[Kyoto]] that bear  seal designating the “Lotuses and Birds” compositions as done by a “Mr. Yu from Piling.” Mr. Yu is elsewhere identified as a Yu Ziming, active in the late 13th century. Yu was clearly a master of a local tradition of genre painting that specialized in plants, flowers, birds, insects and other genre subjects.

==Manners==
A manner of painting in this school of painting was the ''mogu'' (沒骨) or “boneless” style which eschewed clear outlines in ink for washes in color or monochrome ink itself.

==Examples in Exhibitions==
The “Egrets and Lotuses” scrolls now in the [[Tokyo National Museum]] are typical of works closer to the year 1300. They display a trend toward pattern and professional artisanship, away from the creativity that originally characterized the school.

The "Birds and Lotuses” scroll reproduced with this article can be easily seen as another example of this period work with its exclusive ink wash and stylized positioning of the birds.

The earlier scrolls in the Chion-in Monastery however are examples of works displaying a greater animation and with their use of color a greater sensuous appeal.

In general, the term '''credit''' in the artistic or intellectual sense refers to an acknowledgement of those who contributed to a work, whether through ideas or in a more direct sense.

==Credit in the arts==
In the creative [[arts]], credits are an acknowledgement of those who participated in the production. They are often shown at the end of movies and on CD jackets. In [[film]], [[video]], [[television]], [[theater]], etc., ''credits'' means the list of [[actor]]s and behind-the-scenes staff who contributed to the production.
{{seealso|Motion picture credits}}
===Non-fiction===
In [[non-fiction]] writing, especially academic works, it is generally considered important to give credit to sources of information and ideas. Failure to do so often gives rise to charges of [[plagiarism]], and "piracy" of [[intellectual rights]] such as the right to receive a [[copyright|royalty]] for having written.  In this sense the financial and [[individual capital|individual]] meanings are linked.

Academic papers generally contain a lengthy section of footnotes or [[scientific citation|citations]].  Such detailed crediting of sources provides readers with an opportunity to discover more about the cited material. It also provides a check against misquotation, as it's easy for an attributed quote to be checked when the reference is available.  All of this is thought to improve [[integrity]] of the [[instructional capital]] conveyed, which may be quite fragile, and easy to misinterpret or to misapply.

===In fiction===
In [[fiction]] writing, authors are generally expected to give credit to those who contributed significantly to a work. Sometimes authors who do not want credit for their work directly may choose to use a [[pen name]]. A [[ghostwriter]] gives all or some of the credit for his or her writing to someone else.

==In computing==
In [[computer software]] [[software license|licenses]], attribution of credit is sometimes a condition of licensing. For example, original versions of the [[BSD license]] controversially required credit to be provided in the advertisement for software that used licensed code, but only if features or use of the licensed software was mentioned in the advertisement.

[[Software documentation]] is sometimes licensed under similar terms. For example, the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL) used by [[Wikipedia]] requires that acknowledgments to authors be preserved.

[[File:Dancing Man, Australia, end of World War II.jpg|thumb|300px|''Dancing Man'', Sydney, Australia, 15 August 1945]]
The '''Dancing Man''' is the name given to a photograph of a man who was filmed dancing on the street in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], after the end of [[World War II]]. On 15 August 1945, a reporter took note of a man's joyful expression and dance and asked him to do it again. The man consented and was caught on [[Film|motion picture film]] in an Australian edition of the newsreel [[Movietone News]].  The film and stills from it have taken on iconic status in Australian history and culture, and symbolise joyous elation to war's end.

== Identity ==

There has been much debate as to the identity of the dancing man. Frank McAlary, a retired [[barrister]] claims that he was the man photographed pirouetting in [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney]], on 15 August 1945. A [[Queen's Counsel]], [[Chester Porter]], and a former Compensation Court judge, Barry Egan, both claim to have seen Mr. McAlary being filmed dancing.&lt;ref name = "RM"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Theyve-minted-the-dancing-man-but-which-one-is-he/2004/12/07/1102182297816.html "Who is the dancing man?."] Macy, Richard. ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' 8 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The television programme ''[[Where Are They Now? (Australian TV program)|Where Are They Now?]]'', produced by Australia's [[Seven Network]], attempted to solve the mystery of the dancing man's identity. The network hired a [[forensics|forensic]] scientist who examined the film reel and picture and came to the conclusion that it was indeed McAlary.

The [[Royal Australian Mint]], however, chose to portray Ern Hill as the dancing man on a 2005 issue [[Australian 1 dollar coin|$1 coin]] commemorating 60 years since the World War II armistice. Mr. Hill has made a statement that, "The camera came along and I did a bit of a jump around."&lt;ref name = "RM"/&gt; The coin, sculpted by [[Wojciech Pietranik]], does not bear any name. 
 
Rebecca Keenan of Film World Pty. Ltd., says the dancer may be Patrick Blackall.&lt;ref name=blackall&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stephens|first1=Tony|title=Is Ern Hill the mystery dancing man of 1945?|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Is-Ern-Hill-the-mystery-dancing-man-of-1945/2004/12/08/1102182322020.html|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=13 March 2018|date=29 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Blackall has claimed, "I'm the genuine dancing man," and has signed [[statutory declaration]]s that he is the man in the film.&lt;ref name=blackall /&gt; These remain not alone as many others maintain a claim to the moment, it is not conclusive and may never be.

Frank A. Epton, a retired Chartered Accountant living in Alstonville, NSW before he died in February 2013, claimed that he was one of the soldiers in the background of the still image of the dancing man (the soldier without a hat). Papers and photos found in his possession during the administration of his estate support his assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swan|first1=Robert|title=Immortalised in a historical reel|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/immortalised-in-a-historical-reel/1828005/|website=The Northern Star|accessdate=13 March 2018|date=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[statistical analysis]] of [[time series]] and in [[signal processing]], '''directional symmetry''' is a statistical measure of a [[Statistical model|model]]'s performance in predicting the direction of change, positive or negative, of a [[time series]] from one time period to the next.

==Definition==
Given a time series &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; with [[Value (mathematics)|values]] &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; at times &lt;math&gt;i=1, \ldots, n&lt;/math&gt; and a model that makes predictions for those values &lt;math&gt;\hat t_i&lt;/math&gt;, then the directional symmetry (DS) statistic is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{DS}(t,\hat t) = \frac{100}{n-1}\sum_{i=2}^{n}d_i,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;d_i = \begin{cases} 1, &amp; \text{if }(t_i - t_{i-1})(\hat t_i - \hat t_{i-1})&gt; 0 \\ 0, &amp; \text{otherwise} .\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

==Interpretation==
The DS statistic gives the percentage of occurrences in which the sign of the change in value from one time period to the next is the same for both the actual and predicted time series. The DS statistic is a measure of the performance of a model in predicting the direction of value changes. The case &lt;math&gt;DS=100\%&lt;/math&gt; would indicate that a model perfectly predicts the direction of change of a time series from one time period to the next.

[[Image:Dobra Kuca castle drawing.jpg|thumb|Imagined sight of castle Dobra Kuća]]
Medieval [[castle]] '''Dobra Kuća''' (meaning "Good House", also {{lang-hu|Dobrakutya}}) was an important fortification of the region in the [[Middle Ages]]. It is often mentioned in Croatian medieval sources. It is situated near city of [[Daruvar]], [[Croatia]]. Dobra Kuća, owned by various persons, was a vivid centre of then rich country. The castle was built after castle Stupčanica in the 14th century. It was first mentioned in 1335, when king [[Charles I of Hungary]] exchanged royal estate of new Litva for castle Dobra Kuća with Dobra Kuća family. While neighbouring castle Stupčanica can be seen from far well, castle Dobra Kuća is a real place of refuge; it is located on a solitary hill surrounded by mountains in every directions and cannot be seen unless you are at the bottom of it.

The [[market town]] of Dobra Kuća was mentioned in 1510s, it belonged to [[Bjelovar-Križevci County]]. The settlement and surrounding area flourished until the conquest by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. Ottoman troops captured the castle in 1542 and henceforth controlled it by a guard of thirty men. Following the retreat of Ottomans, Dobra Kuća fell into decay and disrepair.

'''ERSTE Foundation''' (in German '''DIE ERSTE österreichische Spar-Casse Privatstiftung''' or in short: '''ERSTE Stiftung''') is the biggest [[Austria]]n [[savings bank]] foundation. In 2003, it evolved from the Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse, the first Austrian savings bank founded in 1819. It is the main shareholder of [[Erste Group]]. ERSTE Foundation uses the profit from its [[shares]] to support the development of societies in Central and South Eastern Europe.

==Mission==
ERSTE Foundation is active in Central and South Eastern Europe. Its mission goes back to the savings banks idea of the 19th century. It supports social participation and [[civil society]] engagement; it aims to bring people together and disseminate knowledge of the recent history of a region that has been undergoing dramatic changes since [[Revolutions of 1989|1989]]. As an active foundation, it develops its own projects within the framework of three programs: [[Social Development]], [[Culture]], and [[Europe]].

===Programs===

====Social development====
The foundation encourages the development of fairer and stronger societies, where nobody is left behind. It has developed two complementary strategies of [[social intervention]]: the [[Social integration|integration]] of individuals and groups who live on the margins of society and research into [[social change]]. Its activities create fair prospects for people in difficult social conditions and situations of extreme need with regard to [[education]] and participation.

====Culture====
The culture program works on mostly [[transnationality|transnational]] projects, involving research activities that focus on the [[visual arts]] from the 1960s to the present day. Culture is seen as a driving force for a [[Democracy|democratic]] society and in its ability to forge links between diverse linguistic and geographical regions. Working with artistic strategies creates an experimental playing field for [[utopia]]s and for proposals beyond the feasibility of everyday politics as well as for exploring the possibilities of various artistic approaches. Therefore, the culture program promotes independent projects and those engaged in the cultural sector by providing them with resources and cross-border contacts that are not embedded within state institutions, also to stop the so-called [[brain drain]].

====Europe====
The Foundation promotes the process of [[European integration]] by providing a platform for exchanging ideas, knowledge and initiatives. [[Europeans]] are encouraged to live according to common values, to freely share ideas, to work together and to learn from one another. The projects focus on establishing a lively culture of dialogue. In an environment insisting on differences, people should be enabled to experience feelings of [[solidarity]], connection and [[cooperation]]. The projects anticipate the reality of a unified Europe and convey the potential of the common [[European Union|union]], in particular in those countries where, at present, EU programmes cannot yet be implemented. A focus lies on the work with young people, programs for journalists and debates on the future of Europe.

===Projects (examples)===
*'''[[Balkan Fellowship for Journalistic Excellence]]''' – Fellowship for journalists from 9 [[Balkan]] countries in cooperation with the [[Balkan Investigative Reporting Network]] and the [[Robert Bosch Stiftung]] to strengthen [[democracy]] and [[free speech]] through good quality journalism in [[News media|media]].
*'''[[ERSTE Foundation Fellowship for Social Research]]''' – 10 Eastern European scientists are granted each year a fellowship to research in depth a sociological, demographic, or socio-political topic within a European context.
*'''Gender Check. Femininity and Masculinity in the Art of Eastern Europe''' – the first exhibition, which dealt with the topic of [[gender roles]] and offered a representative overview of art from Eastern Europe since the 1960s. 25 curators from 24 countries worked for the show in the [[MUMOK|Museum of Modern Art Vienna]] that featured more than 400 works of more than 200 artists. It was also presented at [[Zachęta|Zacheta National Gallery]] in [[Warsaw]].
*'''[[Kontakt. The Art Collection of Erste Group and ERSTE Foundation]]''' - the art collection is a non-profit art association based in Vienna. Its purpose is the support and promotion of Central, East and Southeast European Art.
*'''[[KomenskýFond]]''' - Named after the Czech [[renaissance]] [[pedagogue]] [[Johann Comenius|Jan Komenský]] the fund is a cooperation of [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas Austria]] and ERSTE Foundation, established in 9 countries to help alleviate [[poverty]] through [[education]] especially for children in [[Romani people|Romani]] communities.
*'''PATTERNS Lectures''' - This series of lectures supports the development of new university courses in Central and South Eastern Europe in the fields of [[art history]], [[cultural theory]], and [[cultural studies]]. It supports lecturers’ international study visits and encourages international academic exchange by offering the possibility of guest lectures.
*'''[[tranzit.org]]''' – the independent tranzit network operates in [[Austria]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]] and the [[Slovak Republic]]. Each tranzit local ‘unit’ has its unique and autonomous way of working, deals with several artistic settings and manifests itself in lectures, performances, discussions, publications, exhibitions, and researches. In 2010, the tranzit team was one of the three curatorial teams for the European [[wikt:biennial|art biennial]] [[Manifesta]] 8 in [[Murcia]], [[Spain]].

===Social banking and financial inclusion===
Being a savings bank foundation, ERSTE Foundation is committed to the social savings bank idea of the 19th century. Therefore, [[social banking]] and [[financial inclusion]] are key issues within the Program Social Development. The best known projects in this field are: 
*'''Die Zweite Sparkasse''' (The Second Savings Bank) - A bank for the unbankable
*'''good.bee''' - the [[micro finance]] and [[social entrepreneurship]] institute of Erste Group and ERSTE Foundation
*'''The Social Business Tour 2010''' - a roadshow with workshops to promote [[social business]] in Eastern Europe with [[Muhammad Yunus]]

===Awards===

====ERSTE Foundation Award for Social Integration====
Every two years, starting in 2007, the [[ERSTE Foundation Award for Social Integration]] is awarded to projects working successfully for the [[social integration]] of people in their communities. During an [[open call]], 30 winners are selected among over 1000 applicants from 12 countries (2011) and will receive a total price money of EUR 610,000. Additionally, the publicly honoured NGOs get two years for free [[public relations]] (PR) support for their projects and access to an international network of peers. Award ceremonies have been held so far in [[Ljubljana]] (2007), [[Bucharest]] (2009), and [[Prague]] (2011).

====Igor Zabel Award for Culture and Theory====
ERSTE Foundation established the biennial [[Igor Zabel Award for Culture and Theory]] in 2008. It supports the work of [[art historian]]s and [[Art theory|theorists]] in CEE and highlights the notion of arts and culture, encouraging the production of cultural knowledge and exchange between ‘East’ and ‘West’. The award is named after the Slovenian author, art critic and [[curator]] [[Igor Zabel]] (1958–2005), the senior curator of [[Ljubljana|Ljubljana's]] [[Moderna Galerija]]. He established cultural links between Eastern and Western Europe.

===Cooperations with other foundations in international projects===
*[[Archis SEE Network]]
*[[European Fund for the Balkans]] (EFB)
*[[Forum for Roma Inclusion]]
*[[Grant Makers East Forum]]
*[[Roma Education Fund]] (REF)
*[[Networking European Citizenship Education]] (NECE)

==History==
The origins of the foundation go back to the 19th century. The Erste österreichische Spar-Casse was founded in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;C. Rapp, N. Rapp-Wimberger: Arbeite, Sammle, Vermehre. Von der ersten Oesterreichischen Spar-Casse zur Erste Bank. Christian Brandstätter Verlag, Vienna 2005, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the amendment to the Austrian Savings Bank Act, Erste österreichische Spar-Casse was split into an operational [[bank]] ([[Erste Group|Erste Bank AG]]) and a [[holding company]] (DIE ERSTE österreichische Spar-Casse Anteilsverwaltungssparkasse, in short: AVS) in 1993. In 1997 Erste Bank, which had merged with GiroCredit Bank AG der Sparkassen, [[went public]], making AVS the main shareholder of the company, which has been listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange ever since. In 2003 AVS was formally transformed into DIE ERSTE österreichische Spar-Casse Privatstiftung, in short: ERSTE Stiftung (ERSTE Foundation), which began its operations two years later.

The first major projects included the Zweite Wiener Vereins-Sparcasse, in short: Zweite Sparkasse, founded in 2006, and the Academy for Central European Schools (aces) network, established in the same year. 2007 saw the presentation of the first ERSTE Foundation Award for Social Integration in [[Ljubljana]] and the launch of the first call of the Balkan Fellowship for Journalistic Excellence. The Igor Zabel Award for Culture and Theory and the foundation of good.bee followed in 2008. In 2009 [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] and [[3sat]] first broadcast the TV documentary series "Balkan Express (Return to Europe)" and the ERSTE Foundation Award for Social Integration went into its second round, with the ceremony being held in [[Bucharest]]. The largest culture project to date – the exhibition Gender Check – opened at MUMOK Vienna in 2010. In the same year, the Social Business Tour 2010 with [[Muhammad Yunus]] toured through six Eastern European countries with the aim of introducing the concept of social business as a form of sustainable economic activity in [[Vienna]], [[Bratislava]], [[Budapest]], [[Prague]], Bucharest and [[Belgrade]]. That same year the Igor Zabel Award for Culture and Theory was awarded to Polish art historian Piotr Piotrowski in [[Barcelona]]. In 2011 the ERSTE Foundation Award for Social Integration – then in its third round – was presented in Prague to 34 projects from 12 countries.

'''''Echo and Narcissus''''' is a painting by [[John William Waterhouse]], dating from 1903. It illustrates the poem ''[[Echo and Narcissus]]'' from [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.

John William Waterhouse (1847–1917) was an English painter who, because of his style and themes, has been classified as a [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]], but is more accurately described as a [[Neoclassicism|Neo-Classical]] painter{{citation needed |reason=contradicts contemporary art scholarship |date=July 2017}}.  He painted over 200 works, mainly in the [[genre]]s of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] [[mythology]], and of historical or literary subjects.  One of his common themes is the ''[[femme fatale]]'', the woman who ensnares a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.jwwaterhouse.com/| title = John William Waterhouse| accessdate =22 April 2010 | publisher = jwwaterhouse.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Echo and Narcissus'' is in the genre of classical mythology.  In Ovid's version of the myth, [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] was the son of the river god [[Cephissus (mythology)|Cephissus]] and the [[nymph]] [[Liriope (nymph)|Liriope]].  His parents were told that he would live to an old age if he did not look at himself.  He rejected all the nymphs and women who fell in love with him.  One of these was the nymph [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]], who was so upset by her rejection that she withdrew from life and wasted away until all that was left was a whisper.  Her prayers were heard by the goddess [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]] who caused Narcissus to fall in love with his own reflection.  He continued to look at his reflection until he died.  A ''[[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]]'' flower grew on the spot where he died.

The painting is in [[Oil painting|oil]] on [[canvas]] and measures {{convert|109.2|cm|in|0}} by {{convert|189.2|cm|in|0}}.  It forms part of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] collection in the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], England, having been purchased by the museum in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 1994| title = The Walker Art Gallery| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = London| place = | publisher = Scala| pages = | page = 77| id = | isbn = 1-85759-037-6| doi = | oclc = | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Kemeys''' (January 31, 1843 – May 11, 1907) was an [[United States|American]] sculptor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/05/12/101031742.pdf| title=Edward Kemeys Dead| date=May 12, 1907| work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considered America's first [[animalier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brookgreen Gardens Sculpture|last=Salmon|first=Robin R.|publisher=Brookgreen Gardens, SC|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
He is best known for his sculptures of animals, particularly the [[Lions (Kemeys)|two bronze lions]] that mark the entrance to the [[Art Institute of Chicago Building]] in [[Chicago Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;http://explorechicago.org/city/en/things_see_do/attractions/park_district/lions__in_grant_park.html&lt;/ref&gt; Kemeys was also a Captain in the 4th United States Colored Heavy Artillery, Company H, writer, lecturer, and adventurer in the Western United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Life==
Kemeys was born on January 31, 1843 in [[Savannah, Georgia]].&lt;ref name="NMWA"&gt;{{citation |publisher=[[National Museum of Wildlife Art]] |url=http://www.wildlifeart.org/artists/artistDetails/index.php?aID=235 |title=Edward Kemeys Biography |accessdate=August 26, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; to Abby Greene of Providence, RI and William Kemeys of Scarborough, NY.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fine Art Source Newsletter|last=Richman|first=Michael|publisher=John Alan Walker|year=1971|isbn=|location=Panorama City, CA|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kemeys family lived in Savannah, GA, moving back to New York after the death of his mother in 1843. Kemeys first worked in the iron business of New York City at age seventeen.

'''Civil War'''

When the Civil War broke out, Kemeys enlisted. He was 19. Kemeys volunteered for the 65th Volunteer Regiment of the State of New York. "I served in the Peninsula campaign till I fell sick of fever and was discharged. I went in again later as a second lieutenant." Kemeys re-enlisted as a commissioned officer in the 4th United States Colored Heavy Artillery, Company H attaining the rank of Captain. He resigned his commission in 1866.

'''After the Civil War'''&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Edward_Kemeys.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;He studied in [[New York City]] and then [[Paris]].  In Paris, he was impressed by the style of [[Antoine-Louis Barye]], although in no sense an imitator. He made a specialty of the wild animals of the American continent. His “Fight between Buffalo and Wolves” attracted much attention at the Paris salon in 1878. Among his other important works are “Panther and Deer,” and “Coyote and Raven.” A colossal head of a buffalo for the facade of the station of the Pacific railroad at [[St. Louis, Missouri]], which was cast in bronze in New York in August, 1887, was the largest work of its kind that had been done in the United States. Another bronze statue of a panther named "Still Hunt," is permanently situated on a rock flanking the East Drive of New York City's Central Park.

Kemeys died in [[Washington, D.C.]] on May 11, 1907.&lt;ref name="NMWA" /&gt; He and his wife, Laura Kemeys are buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

'''Eigengrau''' ([[German language|German]]: "intrinsic gray", {{abbr|lit.|literally}} "own gray"; {{IPA-de|ˈʔaɪ̯gn̩ˌgʁaʊ̯|pron}}), also called '''Eigenlicht''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] and German: "own light"), '''dark light''', or '''brain gray''', is the uniform dark [[gray]] background that many people report seeing in the absence of [[visible light|light]].  The term ''Eigenlicht'' dates back to the nineteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last= Ladd |first=Trumbull|title=Direct control of the retinal field.|journal=Psychological Review|year=1894|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/rev/1/4/351/ |accessdate=28 September 2012|doi=10.1037/h0068980|volume=1|pages=351–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has rarely been used in recent scientific publications. Nowadays, the phenomenon is more commonly referred to as "visual noise" or "background adaptation" because it is accompanied by perception of an ever-changing field of tiny black and white dots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hansen RM, Fulton AB |title=Background adaptation in children with a history of mild retinopathy of prematurity |journal=Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages= 320–4 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10634637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eigengrau is perceived as lighter than a [[black]] object in normal lighting conditions, because [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] is more important to the visual system than absolute brightness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wallach | first = Hans | year = 1948 | title = Brightness Constancy and the Nature of Achromatic Colors | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 38 | pages = 310&amp;ndash;324 | doi = 10.1037/h0053804 | pmid =18865234 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the night sky looks darker than eigengrau because of the contrast provided by the stars.

== Cause ==
Researchers noticed early on{{when|date=October 2018}} that the shape of intensity-sensitivity curves could be explained by assuming that an intrinsic source of noise in the [[retina]] produces random events indistinguishable from those triggered by real [[photon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Barlow | first = H.

 | isbn = 0-12-078950-7 | chapter = Retinal and Central Factors in Human Vision Limited by Noise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later experiments on [[rod cell]]s of [[cane toad]]s (''Bufo marinus'')  showed that the frequency of these spontaneous events is strongly temperature-dependent, which implies that they are caused by the thermal [[isomerization]] of [[rhodopsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baylor | first1 = D. A. | first2 = G | last2 = Matthews | first3 = K.-W. | last3 = Yau

 | journal = Journal of Physiology | volume = 309 | pages = 591&amp;ndash;621
 | pmid = 6788941 | pmc = 1274605 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In human rod cells, these events occur about once every 100 seconds on average, which, taking into account the number of rhodopsin molecules in a rod cell, implies that the [[half-life]] of a rhodopsin molecule is about 420 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Baylor | first = Denis A.

 | url = http://www.iovs.org/cgi/reprint/28/1/34
 | pmid = 3026986
 | issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indistinguishability of dark events from photon responses supports this explanation, because rhodopsin is at the input of the [[transduction (physiology)|transduction]] chain. On the other hand, processes such as the spontaneous release of [[neurotransmitter]]s cannot be completely ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shapley | first1 = Robert

'''Ephraim Moses Lilien''' (1874–1925) was an [[art nouveau]] [[illustrator]] and [[printmaker]] particularly noted for his art on Jewish themes. He is sometimes called the "first [[Zionist]] artist."&lt;ref name="autogeneratedil"&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph3/articles_assaph3/11finkelstein.pdf Haim Finkelstein, Lilien and Zionism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040414135819/http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph3/articles_assaph3/11finkelstein.pdf |date=2004-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ephraim Moses Lilien (''Maurycy Lilien'') was born in 1874,in [[Drohobycz]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]],&lt;ref name="EncyclJudaica"&gt;Werner, Alfred; Radjai-Ordoubadi, Jihan (2007). "Lilien, Ephraim Moses." ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA. Vol. 13, p. 14. Retrieved via ''Gale Virtual Reference Library'' database, 18 May 2018. Also available online via ''[https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/lilien-ephraim-moses Encyclopedia.com].&lt;/ref&gt; then in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. In 1889-1893 Lilien learned painting and graphic techniques at the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|Academy of Arts in Kraków]]. He studied under Polish painter [[Jan Matejko]] from 1890 to 1892.

As a member of the [[Zionist Movement]], Lilien traveled to [[Palestine (region)#Ottoman rule(1841–1917)|Ottoman Palestine]] several times between 1906 and 1918.&lt;ref name="hasencleverart1"&gt;[http://www.hasencleverart.com/artists/lilien.html On Ephraim Moses Lilien] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314062958/http://www.hasencleverart.com/artists/lilien.html |date=2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lilien attended the Fifth [[Zionist Congress]], held in [[Basel]], as a member of the Democratic Fraction, an opposition group that supported the development of secular national culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Stanley Friedman|Friedman, Maurice S.]] (1988). ''[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=yOp5uXpqEb4C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=lilien+belonged+to+democratic+fraction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6KGCFaGFPh&amp;sig=OiZ9a0LxZumYmzkNLd9dTX1yQfM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXtNWlqcjWAhXFyRQKHZA0BOIQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=lilien%20belonged%20to%20democratic%20fraction&amp;f=false Martin Buber's Life and Work]''. Detroit: Wayne State University Press. {{ISBN|0814319475}}. p.&amp;nbsp;59.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, at the Seventh Zionist Congress, in Basel, he, along with [[Boris Schatz]], became a member of a committee formed to help establish the [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design|Bezalel Art School]].&lt;ref name="EncyclJudaica"/&gt; As part of that work he accompanied Schatz to  [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="autogeneratedil"/&gt;

==Art career==
Lilien was one of the two artists to accompany Boris Schatz to what is now [[Israel]] in 1906 for the purpose of establishing [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design]], and taught the school's first class in 1906. Although his stay in the country was short-lived, he left his indelible stamp on the creation of an Eretz Israel style, placing biblical subjects in the Zionist context and oriental settings, conceived in an idealized Western design. In the first two decades of the century, Lilien's work served as a model for the [[Bezalel school|Bezalel group]].

Lilien is known for his famous photographic portrait of [[Theodor Herzl]]. He often used Herzl as a model, considering his features a perfect representation of the "New Jew."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exhibits.gelman.gwu.edu/expressions/herzl.htm |title=Artistic Expressions of the Jewish Renaissance|publisher=George Washington University Libraries}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, he received an award for photography from the avantgarde magazine ''[[Jugend]]''. Lilien illustrated several books. In 1923, an exhibition of his work opened in New York.&lt;ref name="hasencleverart1"/&gt;

Lilien's illustrated books include ''Juda'' (1900), Biblically-themes poetry by Lilien's Christian friend, Börries Freiherr von Münchausen, and ''Lieder des Ghetto'' (Songs of the Ghetto) (1903), Yiddish poems by Morris Rosenfeld translated into German.

Lilien died in [[Badenweiler]], [[Germany]] in 1925. A street in the [[Nayot]] neighborhood of Jerusalem is named for him.

'''Frederika "Friedl" Dicker-Brandeis''' (30 July 1898 Vienna – 9 October 1944 Auschwitz-Birkenau), was an Austrian artist and educator murdered by the [[Nazis]] in the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] [[extermination camp]] .

==Biography==
'''Frederika Dicker''' was born in Vienna on 30 July 1898. She married Pavel Brandeis in 1936 and used the double-barrelled surname after that. Dicker-Brandeis was a student of [[Johannes Itten]] at his private school in [[Vienna]], and later followed Itten to study and teach at the [[Weimar]] [[Bauhaus]]. She was involved in the textile design, printmaking, bookbinding, and typography workshops there from 1919-1923. After leaving the Bauhaus, she worked as an artist and textile designer in [[Berlin]], [[Prague]], and [[Hronov]]. Dicker-Brandeis wrote to a friend in 1940:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/10/arts/design/10SALA.html Keeping Creativity Alive, Even in Hell] By [[Julie Salamon|JULIE SALAMON]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|I remember thinking in school how I would grow up and would protect my students from unpleasant impressions, from uncertainty, from scrappy learning... Today only one thing seems important — to rouse the desire towards creative work, to make it a habit, and to teach how to overcome difficulties that are insignificant in comparison with the goal to which you are striving.}}

==In World War II==
Dicker-Brandeis and her husband were deported to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Terezín]] "model ghetto" in December 1942. During her time at Terezín, she gave art lessons and lectures.
She helped to organize secret education classes for the children of Terezín. She saw drawing and art as a way for the children to understand their emotions and their environment. In this capacity, she was giving art therapy.

At Terezin, she persisted in pursuing her goal — ''"to rouse the desire towards creative work."'' &lt;ref&gt;taken from the above mentioned article of Julie Salamon&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1944, Brandeis was transported to [[Auschwitz]]; Dicker-Brandeis volunteered for the next transport to join him. But before she was taken away, she gave to [[Raja Engländerova]], the chief tutor of Girls' Home L 410, two suitcases with 4,500 drawings.

F. Dicker-Brandeis died in [[Auschwitz II|Birkenau]] on 9 October 1944.&lt;ref name="Sterling"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sterling|first=Eric|title=Life in the ghettos during the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywZG1TwqHwoC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=%22Friedl+Dicker-Brandeis%22+auschwitz&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LweCTbf_LMbpgQfZ-tXfCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Friedl%20Dicker-Brandeis%22%20auschwitz&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8156-0803-5|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband Pavel, survived.

==Legacy==
After the war, [[Willy Groag]], the director of the Girls' home L 410 brought the suitcases with children's drawings to the Jewish Community in Prague. From the nearly 660 authors of the drawings, 550 were killed in the Holocaust. The drawings are now in the [[Jewish Museum in Prague]]'s collection, with some on display in the [[Pinkas Synagogue]] in Prague.

In 1999, a Friedl Dicker-Brandeis exhibition, organized by the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] and curated by Elena Makarova of Israel, opened in Vienna. The exhibition was shown in Czech Republic, Germany, Sweden, France, USA, and Japan. Tokyo Fuji Art Museum founder [[Daisaku Ikeda]], who was instrumental in bringing the exhibit to Japan, commented:{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

{{Quote|The various artworks left behind by this great woman and the children of Terezin are their legacy to the present, to all of us today. They demand that we continue in our quest for a society that truly treasures human life, transcending all differences of race, religion, politics and ideology. It remains my heartfelt hope that this exhibit may provide a moment of introspection for its viewers, a moment for us to reaffirm the importance of our rights as human beings and the value of life itself.}}

==Plot summary==

The story begins with [[Klara Hitler|Klara]], an [[Austrian German]] woman, who has just given birth to a son. She is fearful that this child will die, as she has had three children, named Otto, Gustav and Ida, previously and all of them have died. Her husband, [[Alois Hitler|Alois]], remembers how small and frail the new baby is, even compared to the others. The [[doctor of medicine|doctor]] and [[midwife]] assure the mother that the baby is healthy. They beg the father to show more compassion toward his wife and to hope for the child's survival. The story ends with Klara praying, "He must live, Alois. He must, he must... Oh God, be merciful unto him now..." Her son's name is [[Adolf Hitler]].

[[File:The idle servant.jpg|thumb|''The Idle Servant''; housemaid troubles were the subject of several of [[Nicolaes Maes]]' works]]

'''Genre art''' is the pictorial representation in any of various media of scenes or events from everyday life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=genre&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300139140 Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus, s.v. "genre"]. Accessed 2 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; such as markets, domestic settings, interiors, parties, inn scenes, and street scenes. Such representations (also called '''genre works''', '''genre scenes''', or '''genre views''') may be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Some variations of the term ''genre art'' specify the medium or type of visual work, as in ''genre painting'', ''genre prints'', ''genre photographs'', and so on.

Rather confusingly, the normal meaning of [[genre]], covering any particular combination of an artistic medium and a type of subject matter (as, for example, in the [[romance novel]]), is also used in the [[visual arts]].  Thus, genre works, especially when referring to the [[painting of the Dutch Golden Age]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]]—the great periods of genre works—may also be used as an umbrella term for painting in various specialized categories such as [[still-life]], [[marine painting]], [[architectural painting]] and animal painting, as well as genre scenes proper where the emphasis is on human figures. Painting was divided into a [[hierarchy of genres]], with [[history painting]] at the top, as the most difficult and therefore prestigious, and still life and architectural painting at the bottom. But history paintings are a genre in painting, not genre works.

The following concentrates on painting, but genre motifs were also extremely popular in many forms of the [[decorative arts]], especially from the [[Rococo]] of the early 18th century onwards. Single figures or small groups decorated a huge variety of objects such as [[porcelain]], furniture, [[wallpaper]] and textiles.

==Genre painting==
[[Image:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 014.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''Peasant Dance'', c. 1568, oil on wood, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]] the Elder]]

''Genre painting'', also called ''genre scene'' or ''petit genre'', depicts aspects of [[everyday life]] by portraying ordinary people engaged in common activities. One common definition of a genre scene is that it shows figures to whom no identity can be attached either individually or collectively—thus distinguishing ''petit genre'' from [[history painting]]s (also called ''grand genre'') and [[portrait]]s. A work would often be considered as a genre work even if it could be shown that the artist had used a known person—a member of his family, say—as a model. In this case it would depend on whether the work was likely to have been intended by the artist to be perceived as a portrait—sometimes a subjective question. The depictions can be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Because of their familiar and frequently sentimental subject matter, genre paintings have often proven popular with the [[bourgeoisie]], or [[middle class]].  Genre themes appear in nearly all art traditions. Painted decorations in ancient [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tombs often depict banquets, recreation, and agrarian scenes, and [[Peiraikos]] is mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] as a [[Hellenistic]] panel painter of "low" subjects, such as survive in [[mosaic]] versions and provincial wall-paintings at [[Pompeii]]: "barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Book XXXV.112 of ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] often illustrated scenes of everyday peasant life, especially in the ''[[Labours of the Months]]'' in the calendar section of [[books of hours]], most famously [[Les Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]].

===To 1800===
[[File:Merry company, by Dirck Hals.jpg|thumb|''[[Merry company]]'', by Dirck Hals]]
The [[Low Countries]] dominated the field until the 18th century, and in the 17th century both [[Flemish Baroque painting]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] produced numerous specialists who mostly painted genre scenes.  In the previous century, the Flemish [[Renaissance]] painter [[Jan Sanders van Hemessen]] painted innovative large-scale genre scenes, sometimes including a moral theme or a religious scene in the background in the first half of the 16th century.  These were part of a pattern of "[[Mannerist]] inversion" in [[Antwerp]] painting, giving "low" elements previously in the decorative background of images prominent emphasis.  [[Joachim Patinir]] expanded [[landscape painting|his landscapes]], making the figures a small element, and [[Pieter Aertsen]] painted works dominated by spreads of [[still life]] food and genre figures of cooks or market-sellers, with small religious scenes in spaces in the background.  [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] made peasants and their activities, very naturalistically treated, the subject of many of his paintings, and genre painting was to flourish in Northern Europe in Brueghel's wake.
[[File:Wybrand Hendriks - Interieur met naaiende vrouw.jpg|thumb|Interior with woman by [[Wybrand Hendriks]] ]] [[Adriaen van Ostade|Adriaen]] and [[Isaac van Ostade]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Adriaan Brouwer]], [[David Teniers the Younger|David Teniers]], [[Aelbert Cuyp]], [[Johannes Vermeer]] and [[Pieter de Hooch]] were among the many painters specializing in genre subjects in the Low Countries during the 17th century. The generally small scale of these artists' paintings was appropriate for their display in the homes of middle class purchasers. Often the subject of a genre painting was based on a popular ''emblem'' from an [[Emblem book]]. This can give the painting a double meaning, such as in [[Gabriel Metsu]]'s [[:Image:Gabriel Metsu 003.jpg|''The Poultry seller'', 1662]], showing an old man offering a [[rooster]] in a symbolic pose that is based on a lewd engraving by Gillis van Breen (1595–1622), with the same scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/jong076erot01_01/jong076erot01_01_0001.htm|title=E. de Jongh, 'Erotica in vogelperspectief. De dubbelzinnigheid van een reeks zeventiende-eeuwse genrevoorstellingen' |date=|website=DBNL|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[merry company]]'' showed a group of figures at a party, whether making music at home or just drinking in a tavern. Other common types of scenes showed markets or fairs, village festivities ("kermesse"), or soldiers in camp.
[[File:Jean-Baptiste Greuze - Filial Piety - WGA10664.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]], ''Filial Piety'', 1765]]

In [[Italy]], a "school" of genre painting was stimulated by the arrival in [[Rome]] of the Dutch painter [[Pieter van Laer]] in 1625. He acquired the nickname "Il Bamboccio" and his followers were called the ''[[Bamboccianti]]'', whose works would inspire [[Giacomo Ceruti]], [[Antonio Cifrondi]], and [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]] among many others.

[[Le Nain|Louis le Nain]] was an important exponent of genre painting in 17th-century France, painting groups of peasants at home, where the 18th century would bring a heightened interest in the depiction of everyday life, whether through the [[romanticism|romanticized]] paintings of [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]], or the careful [[realism (arts)|realism]] of [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin|Chardin]]. [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (1725-1805) and others painted detailed and rather sentimental groups or individual portraits of peasants that were to be influential on 19th-century painting.

In England, [[William Hogarth]] (1697–1764) conveyed comedy, social criticism and moral lessons through canvases that told stories of ordinary people ful of narrative detail (aided by long sub-titles), often in serial form, as in his ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', first painted in 1732–33, then engraved and published in print form in 1735.

Spain had a tradition predating [[The Book of Good Love]] of social observation and commentary based on the Old Roman Latin tradition, practiced by many of its painters and [[illuminated manuscript|illuminators]].  At the height of the Spanish Empire and the beginning of its slow decline, many [[picaresque]] genre scenes of street life—as well as the kitchen scenes known as [[bodegones]]—were painted by the artists of The [[Spanish Golden Age]], notably [[Velázquez]] (1599–1660) and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] (1617–82). More than a century later, the Spanish artist [[Francisco de Goya]] (1746–1828) used genre scenes in painting and [[printmaking]] as a medium for dark commentary on the human condition. His ''[[The Disasters of War]]'', a series of 82 genre incidents from the [[Peninsular War]], took genre art to unprecedented heights of expressiveness.

With the decline of religious and historical painting in the 19th century, artists increasingly found their subject matter in the life around them. [[Realism (art)|Realists]] such as [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819–77) upset expectations by depicting everyday scenes in huge paintings—at the scale traditionally reserved for "important" subjects—thus blurring the boundary which had set genre painting apart as a "minor" category. [[History painting]] itself shifted from the exclusive depiction of events of great public importance to the depiction of genre scenes in historical times, both the private moments of great figures, and the everyday life of ordinary people. In French art this was known as the [[Troubador style]].  This trend, already apparent by 1817 when [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] painted ''Henri IV Playing with His Children'', culminated in the [[pompier]] art of French academicians such as [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904) and [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]] (1815–91).  In the second half of the century interest in genre scenes, often in historical settings or with pointed social or moral comment, greatly increased across Europe.

[[William Powell Frith]] (1819–1909) was perhaps the most famous English genre painter of the Victorian era, painting large and extremely crowded scenes; the expansion in size and ambition in 19th-century genre painting was a common trend. Other 19th-century English genre painters include [[Augustus Leopold Egg]], [[Frederick Daniel Hardy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hardy Family of Artists: Frederick Daniel, George, Heywood, James and their descendants|last=Hardy|first=Kimber|publisher=ACC Art Books|year=2016|isbn=978-185149-826-0|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk UK|pages=12–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Elgar Hicks]], [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[John Everett Millais]].  Scotland produced two influential genre painters, [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]] (1744–96) and [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] (1785–1841). Wilkie's ''The Cottar's Saturday Night'' (1837) inspired a major work by the French painter [[Gustave Courbet]], ''[[After Dinner at Ornans]]'' (1849). Famous [[Russia]]n realist painters like [[Pavel Fedotov]], [[Vasily Perov]], and [[Ilya Repin]] also produced genre paintings.

In Germany, [[Carl Spitzweg]] (1808–85) specialized in gently humorous genre scenes, and in Italy [[Gerolamo Induno]] (1825–90) painted scenes of military life. Subsequently, the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], as well as such 20th-century artists as [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Itshak Holtz]], [[Edward Hopper]], and [[David Park (painter)|David Park]] painted scenes of daily life. But in the context of modern art the term "genre painting" has come to be associated mainly with painting of an especially anecdotal or sentimental nature, painted in a traditionally realistic technique.

The first true genre painter in the United States was the German immigrant [[John Lewis Krimmel]], who learning from Wilkie and Hogarth, produced gently humorous scenes of life in Philadelphia from 1812–21. Other notable 19th-century genre painters from the United States include [[George Caleb Bingham]], [[William Sidney Mount]], and [[Eastman Johnson]].

The works of American painter [[Ernie Barnes]] (1938–2009) and those of illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]] (1894–1978) could exemplify a more modern type of genre painting.

While genre painting began, in the 17th century, with representations by Europeans of European life, the invention and early development of photography coincided with the most expansive and aggressive era of European imperialism, in the mid-to-late 19th century, and so genre photographs, typically made in the proximity of military, scientific and commercial expeditions, often also depict the people of other cultures that Europeans encountered throughout the world.

Although the distinctions are not clear, genre works should be distinguished from [[Ethnography|ethnographic studies]], which are pictorial representations resulting from direct observation and descriptive study of the culture and way of life of particular societies, and which constitute one class of products of such disciplines as [[anthropology]] and the [[behavioural sciences]].

The development of photographic technology to make cameras portable and exposures instantaneous enabled photographers to venture beyond the studio to follow other art forms in the depiction of everyday life. This category has come to be known as [[street photography]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bystander: A History of Street Photography'' by [[Joel Meyerowitz]] and [[Colin Westerbeck]], Boston: [[Bulfinch Press]], 1994. {{ISBN|0-82121-755-0}}.

'''''His Master's Voice''''' is a [[satirical]] [[comedy]] series on [[BBC Radio 4]].  It is written by both [[Mark Tavener]], who also wrote the satirical novel ''[[In the Red (novel)|In The Red]]'' and the satirical radio series ''[[Absolute Power (comedy)|Absolute Power]]'', and [[Steve Punt]].  Their writing satirises both the hard-right Conservatism and "caring Conservatism", along with the rest of British politics. Following Tavener's death in October 2007, no new series have been produced.

==Plot==
It is set in the office of a [[Conservative]] magazine called "The Blue Touch Paper" owned by South African media mogul Lord Malan ([[Robert Hardy]]).  To revive its failing sales, Malan hires a new editor Keith ([[Tony Gardner]]), who was previously the "[[tokenism|token]] [[Tory]]" at the left-wing ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' (and is thus nicknamed "Toynbee", after [[Polly Toynbee]] from the Guardian, by Malan).  This angers Anna ([[Amelia Bullmore]]), the magazine's political commentator (and its acting editor for the last 3 months), who had been hoping to become full editor.  

Much to the discontent of Malan and Anna, Keith then moves the magazine away from its traditional hard-right standpoint to views more in line with [[David Cameron]]'s new "[[Compassionate conservatism#In the United Kingdom|caring Conservatism]]", such as [[environmentalism]].  Anna, Malan and hard-right Tory [[backbencher]]s therefore try to ensure that Keith fails to make a success of the paper, often using Malan's three other national papers to do so.  However, their attempts usually backfire, with Keith's brand of conservatism ''increasing'' rather than decreasing the readership.

==Episodes==
#The magazine has become so Blue that it is sadly out of touch, with a declining and ageing readership. The time has come to appoint a new editor who favours compassionate Cameron conservatism.
#Following a successful first edition, Keith decides that this week's Blue Touch should focus on the Tory's green agenda, much to the chagrin of Lord Malan who spends his life on planes and likes watching ice melt.
#Keith decides that it's time for a Gordon Brown Special, but can the team unite on the angle they take and avoid just being rude about Scotland? And how will Giles contribute when he's busy testing 25 different whiskies for a consumer comparison article?
#Much to Keith's disgust, Lord Malan decides that he wants a globalization special with a celebrity angle. Giles finds himself covering the topic in a burger bar.

==Quotations==
*''first line'' - Malan - Life's too short to read the Guardian.

==Production and broadcast==
The series was recorded at [[The Drill Hall]] in London on 16 May and 22 May 2007, and was broadcast on Wednesday evenings at 6.30pm between 4 July and 25 July 2007.

==Cast==
*Lord Malan, old-fashioned Tory and owner of ''The Blue Touch'' - [[Robert Hardy]]
*Keith, the editor, formerly the "Token Tory" for ''[[The Guardian]]'' - [[Tony Gardner]]
*Anna, vicious, right-wing political columnist and current acting editor - [[Amelia Bullmore]]
*Giles, the paper's [[:wikt:plummy|plummy]] [[gossip columnist]], nicknamed "the [[:wikt:louche|Louche]]" - [[Michael Maloney]]
*Katrina, [[Personal assistant|PA]] and party worker - [[Rachel Atkins]]
*With [[Beth Chalmers]], [[Simon Treves]], [[Eve Webster]]

==Cultural references==
*"Blue Touch" is a reference to the instructions formerly written on the side of most fireworks, usually "light the blue touch paper and retire immediately"; the '''"blue touch paper"''' being the "fuse" used to light the firework. Blue is historically the color most associated with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and, from the early 1980s until September 2006, the Conservative Party's own logo had been a torch. ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5348630.stm BBC News Online article])
*Lord Malan, a South African media mogul, combines elements of real media moguls born in the former [[British Empire]], notably [[Rupert Murdoch]] from [[Australia]], [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]] from [[Canada]], and his fellow Canadian [[Conrad Black]]. In fiction, he echoes the characters of Lambert Leroux in the stage play ''[[Pravda (play)|Pravda]]'', and Robert Hardy's role as Twiggy Rathbone in the TV comedy ''[[Hot Metal]]''.

==Locations==
===New York City campus===
This location includes L'Ecole restaurant on the ground floor and features fare from culinary program students, as well as a ''Culinary Theater'' that hosts events, forums, and lectures from graduates.&lt;ref name=ICCwebsite&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.internationalculinarycenter.com|title=The International Culinary Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Culinary Center is also home to FCI Catering &amp; Events, which creates and caters both on and off-premises private events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fcievents.com/|title= FCI Catering &amp; Events}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===California campus===
Opened in 2011, the center’s California location is in [[Campbell, CA|Campbell]], in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref name=2014CampbellExp/&gt; The facilities consist of kitchens, a library, theaters, an event space and a wine tasting room, which hosts a sommelier training course. The facility is the former location of another culinary school, the Professional Culinary Institute.&lt;ref name=2014Anniversary/&gt;

==Reception==
In 1984 when the school first opened, it was visited by chef [[Julia Child]], who reportedly arranged to have the school profiled on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' one week later.&lt;ref name=2014Anniversary&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Ells|first1=Mara|title=International Culinary Center celebrates four years in Campbell|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/campbell/ci_26034613/campbell-international-culinary-institute-celebrates-four-years-campbell|website=MercuryNews.com|publisher=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[planet]]s appearing in the [[fiction]]al ''[[Transformers]]'' universe.

==Akalo==
'''Akalo''' (also known as Archa Nine) is the 9th planet in the Arca System. It is an organic [[forest]] planet that is populated by the Akalouthians (a technological primitive people).

==Andellor==
'''Andellor''' is a [[library]] planet for a highly evolved society.

==Antilla==
'''Antilla''' is an ancient ringed planet which was the site of an early [[Autobot]] colonization effort. This colony was wiped out by the deadly plague known as Cosmic Rust as seen in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "Cosmic Rust."

Antilla is also home to adorable creatures known as Antillan Bumble-Puppies.

==Arkus==
'''Arkus''' is a planet that is a home to robotic creatures that first appeared in the 3H Comics.

==Aquatron==
'''Aquatron''' was a planet introduced in the novel ''[[Transformers: Retribution]]'' notable for being almost entirely covered in water. It was part of the Quintesson Empire and its inhabitants were enslaved as part of the illusion of the Quintesson "Co-Prosperity Sphere." Aquatron was a Cybertronian colony, and its native inhabitants-the Aquatronians and the Sharkticons-are of Cybertronian descent. The Autobots and Decepticons arrive here and quickly learn that the planet is under Quintesson control, after one of the planet's artificial rings-used to gather and fire energy-disables both their ships. A massive battle then ensues between the Cybertronians and the Sharkticons, with the Sharkticons later abandoning the Quintessons in temporary favor of Megatron. However, the awakening of a massive Quintesson jellyfish known as the Hydratron-which while dormant had served as a continent/city for the inhabitants of the planet-proved devastating, and the Autobots and the Decepticons eventually left the planet behind. One benefit of their visit was that Aquatron was freed from Quintesson rule and fell to the jurisdiction of a massive race of underwater Transformers, including one known as Leviacon. The planet was also inhabited by the [[Pirahnacons]], a deadly race that fed upon Transformers.

Known inhabitants of Aquatron include:

* '''Inquirata the [[Curator]]''' - A Quintesson better known by his title of Curator, Inquirata was stationed on Aquatron to lure the Autobots and Decepticons there. He did so through the use of a replica of the [[Matrix of Leadership]], and hoped to earn the favor of his superiors and be returned to Quintessa. His aspirations were dashed when the Sharkticons rebelled, and he was later killed by Tyrannicon.
* '''Doctor Xeros''' - A Quintesson [[physician]] who worked as the Curator's direct subordinate. He was later killed by the Sharkticons after Megatron took control of them.
* '''Tyrannicon''' - A Sharkticon general created by the Quintessons to lead their enslaved army, and several sizes larger than many of his troops. Tyrannicon forced the Autobots and Decepticons on Aquatron to surrender to him, and was then dispatched to lead the invasion of Cybertron. His forces later rebelled against him under Megatron's command, and he returned to Aquatron, killing the Curator before engaging Megatron in battle. He succeeded in claiming the Matrix replica that had given Megatron control of the Sharkticons and had his own power increased by it, but was killed by the Hydratron.
* '''Leviacon''' - A giant Transformer with a [[whale]]-like alternate form, Leviacon and his race were enslaved by the Quintessons. After Megatron disrupted the Quintessons' control of Aquatron's inhabitants, Leviacon came to Optimus Prime's aid, taking him to face the Curator and later saving him and Megatron from annihilation. He and his people then reclaimed their planet, bidding the Autobots farewell.
* '''The [[Gamekeeper]]''' - A massive, cyborg creature resembling a [[lobster]], the Gamekeeper resided in the bowels of the Hydratron, where he maintained the Quintessons' vicious aquatic pets. On rare occasions he would devour prisoners himself, such as the Sharkticons who dreamed of a future liberator. Unbeknownst to him, that liberator arrived in the form of Decepticon leader Megatron, who with Optimus Prime managed to destroy the Gamekeeper.

==Athenia==

==Beast==
'''Beast''' (also known as '''Beest''') is a distant planet that is inhabited by a race of anthropomorphic animals called [[Battle Beasts|Beastformers]]. There were few dissenters on this planet until the Decepticons arrived. Following this, the inhabitants have each sided with the Autobots or the Decepticons.

==Chaar==
{{Redirect|Chaar|the Indian film|Chaar (film)}}
'''Chaar''' (in Japan, '''Jarr''') appeared in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' television series, debuting in [[List of The Transformers episodes|The Five Faces of Darkness (Part 1)]] in season three. It is a small, burned-out husk of a planet in distant space, easily mistaken for a smudge on a map. It apparently supported a civilization at one point, as abandoned structures are seen on the surface. The surface is desolate and lacks vegetation, but some native lifeforms still exist, including an enormous [[spider]].

Following [[Unicron]]’s attack on [[Cybertron]] in 2005, the [[Autobot]]s reclaimed Cybertron, and the surviving [[Decepticon]]s (who were without their leader [[Galvatron]] at the time) were forced to withdraw to Chaar, where they struggled to eke out an existence, relying on the meager amounts of Energon that could be acquired from other worlds. Eventually, [[Cyclonus]] set out to find Galvatron but, in his absence, the [[Quintessons]] supplied the Decepticons with Energon in return for their assistance in launching an attack against the Autobots. With the return of Galvatron, the alliance was restructured, but the ensuing attack on Cybertron ended in failure, resulting in the Decepticons again returning to Chaar, which served as their base of operations for the remainder of the series.

After [[Earth]] and Cybertron, Chaar appeared in more episodes of the [[The Transformers (TV series)|original television series]] than any other planet.

Chaar was also mentioned in ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'', but as an asteroid belt, not a planet.

In ''[[Transformers Animated]]'', Strika leads "Team Chaar" which consists of Spittor, Cyclonus, Oil Slick, and Blackout.

==Cheyne==
'''Cheyne''' is an arid [[desert]] world whose culture is similar to the [[Wild West]] of the late 19th century United States.

==Circuit Planet==
In ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', '''Circuit Planet''' was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It is covered in roads and highways. Circuit Planet was used for a race between the Autobots and Kicker in the episode "Crash Course." It was won by Arcee and Misha Miramond. Circuit Planet was later destroyed by Megatron who was controlling Unicron's body.

==Combatron==
'''Combatron''' is a planet that was established as colony world that by [[King Atlas (Transformers)|King Atlas]] until a war erupted that left it all but devoid of life.

==Cybertron==
{{Main|Cybertron}}
'''Cybertron''' is a [[fictional planet]], the homeworld of the [[Transformers]] in the various fictional incarnations of the metaseries and toyline by [[Hasbro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Transformers The Movie |work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/037/037249p1.html|accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Japanese series, the planet is referred to as "Cybertron" (first shown on Japanese ''Galaxy Force'' packaging, despite the fact that "Cybertron" is the Japanese name for "Autobot") pronounced as セイバートロン ''Seibātoron''.&lt;ref&gt;Transformers a near burnout // Movie tries to conquer both teens and tots
Chicago Sun-Times; August 11, 1986; by Patricia Smith&lt;/ref&gt; Cybertron is populated by mechanical life forms of variable size who can transform into all kinds of machinery. These are called Cybertronians, or Transformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animerica-mag.com/features/10.02/transformers.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040404085605/http://www.animerica-mag.com/features/10.02/transformers.html |title=Animerica: Animerica Feature: TransACTION |archivedate=4 April 2004 |work=animerica-mag.com |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Daffodil II==
'''Daffodil II''' is a luxurious all-natural planet.

==Darhos==
'''Darhos''' is a planet that was a veritable paradise. As time went on, certain groups began to monopolies control of the resources and money, leading to vast class split. Now Darhos’ decadent ruling class lives in the lap of luxury, eating, drinking and enjoying the pleasures of the flesh amidst architecture and fashion that seems a mad blend of many of Earth’s ancient cultures while the poverty-stricken citizens live in slums. Should the disenfranchised attempt to rise up against their self-proclaimed masters, they would be captured and thrown into labor camps in the barren northern hemisphere.

==Delta Pavonis IV==
'''Delta Pavonis IV''' is a planet where the inhabitants are anthropomorphic [[cat]]s and anthropomorphic [[dog]]s. It was featured in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "The Big Broadcast of 2006."

Earth is the third planet from the [[Sun]] in the [[Solar System]] in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. It is a world populated by a wide variety of native organic lifeforms, most notably, [[human]]s. Versions of this planet are known to exist in many dimensions within the multiverse, and it frequently becomes involved in the conflicts of the Transformers. Perhaps too frequently. Whenever something (or someone) leaves, escapes, or is otherwise ejected from [[Cybertron]], there's a disproportionate chance it will eventually wind up on Earth.

In some universes, Earth becomes the post-apocalyptic planet [[#Gaea|Gaea]]. In other universes, Earth is the planet that formed around [[Unicron]] as seen in ''[[Transformers: Prime]]''.

==Edaps==
'''Edaps''' is a planet that supports mechanized life.

==Gaea==
'''Gaea''' (ガイア ''Gaia''), or '''Gaia''', is post-apocalyptic [[Earth]] in the distant future, tens of thousands of years away. Thanks to the millennia without humanity, most of mankind's structures have been completely destroyed and most of the planet has been grown-over with dense jungle.

==Ganzvort==
'''Ganzvort''' is a planet. All that is known about it is that it has a region called New Jersey.

==Ghennix==
'''Ghennix''' is a planet. It was featured in Marvel Comics where it was devoured by Unicron.

==Gigantion==
'''Gigantion''', or '''Giant Planet''', is a fictional planet home to giant [[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]] in the animated television program ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]''. It is referred to as '''Gigalonia''' in ''Transformers: Galaxy Force'', the Japanese version of the show. Much like how Velocitron is referred to as both "Velocitron" and "Speed Planet", Gigantion has a similar dual name. Its actual name was revealed in the episode "Balance".

Gigantion is home to one of the four Cyber Planet Keys and is one of the four ancient Transformer colonies. The titanic Transformers of Gigantion are large and powerful where their size are compared the combined forms of the known Combiners on both the Autobots' side and the Decepticons' side. The Gigantion Transformers are fortunately not much given to violence and warfare. Most are gentle and peaceful, desiring only to hone their skills and build ever grander structures. They work closely with the small Mini-Con Transformers, who can tackle the delicate tasks too refined for the heavy manipulators of their bulk comrades.

Once part of a star system within the [[Milky Way galaxy]], the planet fell into a spatial rift and was transported to a distant universe. The only Transformers to escape this fate were a quartet of Mini-Cons consisting of Jolt, Six-Speed, Reverb, and Safeguard. Vector Prime eventually discovered and saved them, and they became the Mini-Con Recon Team. Each Transformer on Giant Planet has a Mini-Con partner. The larger Transformers all become construction vehicles with the Mini-Cons integrated into both modes. Gigantion's [[de facto]] leader is [[Metroplex (Transformers)|Metroplex]]. The Transformers from this world have accents that sound Scottish or Irish.

The Giant Transformers have a habit of building giant cities and abandoning them, with older cities (the oldest of which are buried deep within the planet's crust) forbidden by planetary law by erasing their data so no one could come back. The planet was once the target of an attack from the mysterious Planet X, its inhabitants having eradicated most every other civilization in their universe and seeking to subjugate Gigantion's populace as their next conquest. Gigantion's people, however, retaliated, with its inhabitants modifying themselves including their planet with help from the Cyber Planet Key into becoming large enough to combat the invasion.

This eventually led Planet X's inhabitants to use their planet-busting weapon in a last-ditch effort to win the war, but the weapon overloaded and destroyed Planet X. Horrified and saddened by their part in the extinction of an entire race, Gigantion's inhabitants remodeled themselves into construction vehicles and took up their custom of building and then abandoning cities, perhaps as a form of self-punishment, focusing their energies solely on creation, not destruction. The Giant Transformers built cities underground and used holographic images of the sky on the top to make things nice. They started at the very center where they left the greenery. They have many mottoes like "Safety First" and "Always look forward, never back". Gigantion is mentioned in the first chapter of ''[[Transformers: Exodus]]''.

Known inhabitants of Gigantion include:

* '''[[Metroplex (Transformers)|Metroplex]]''' - The acting leader of Gigantion. He transforms into an excavator.
* '''Quickmix''' - The right-hand mech of Metroplex. He transforms into a cement mixer truck.
* '''Menasor''' - An inhabitant of Gigantion who is displeased with the planet's laws. Menasor temporarily sided with the Decepticons. He transforms into an excavation machine.

==Goo==
'''Goo''' is the name of many garbage planets in the original Transformers television series, debuting in the season 3 miniseries ''The Five Faces of Darkness''. Goo is filled with [[Waste|garbage]] and belongs to the [[Junkions]], and takes its name from a powerful adhesive that clings to anything unless disabled. After the [[Quintessons]] blew up Quintessa in an attempt to destroy the [[Autobot]]s, the Autobots were set adrift in space until they landed on Goo. The Autobots were attacked by a giant garbage truck that killed [[Springer (Transformers)|Springer]] before [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]] could disable it. Later the Quintessons found out that the Autobots were alive on Goo. They made an alliance with the [[Decepticon]]s, who were without their leader, [[Galvatron]], and attacked the Autobots on Goo. When Galvatron returned, he was furious that the Decepticons had abandoned him. He attacked the Decepticons and Quintessons with an army of Sweeps, before being placated by Quintesson manipulation. As the Autobots fled, Galvatron destroyed the planet of Goo. Later, the Junkions were able to repair and resuscitate Springer. Another Goo planet was featured in the episode "Chaos," where the Autobots discovered that the Decepticons had come into possession of crystals produced by the monstrous Chaos that could pierce any metal.

==Gorlam Prime==
'''Gorlam Prime''' is a planet that is in the same sector of space as the Benzuli Expanse cosmic anomaly. Originally inhabited by organic beings, they progressively undergo mechanization until they achieve full mechanical status.

==Greengard==
'''Greengard''' is a paradise planet where its plants never turn brown and its flowers never wither.

==Hive==
'''Hive''' is a planet where its inhabitants are [[insectoid]]s that live beneath the surface of the planet.

==Hub==
'''Hub''' is a powerful planet-spanning network of cyberformed structures. It housed the Decepticon progenitor known as the Liege Maximo. Hub was the seat of power for the Cybertronian Empire.

==Hydrax Plateau==
'''Hydrax Plateau''' is a planet where a younger Ratchet was dispatched to when looking for survivors of a chemical attack caused by Oil Slick. It was featured in the comic tie-ins to ''[[Transformers Animated]]''.

The name has subsequently been assigned to a region of Cybertron in the ''[[Transformers: Prime]]'' continuity.

==Hydrus Four==
'''Hydrus Four''' is the only planet on which the miracle restorative Nucleon can be found. It was mentioned in ''[[Transformers: Rescue Bots]]'' episode "A New Hero," in which Blurr instructs E.R.V.I.S. to take the Sigma there.

==Hyperion==
'''Hyperion''' is a planet that is home to the [[mercenary]] Krakon.

==Iron Planet==
In ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', '''Iron Planet''' was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It is metallic in nature and was filled with a lot of Energon. It was destroyed when the Terrorcons deprived it of its Energon.

==Jhi==
'''Jhi''' is a green planet that is home to an ancient race of people with [[dog]]-like faces and [[elf]]-like ears. It was featured in Marvel Comics.

==Jungle Planet==
There had been different versions of '''Jungle Planet''' in the Transformers franchise:

===Jungle Planet #1===
In ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', '''Jungle Planet''' was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It was a lush, [[jungle]]-like paradise.

===Jungle Planet #2===
'''Jungle Planet''' (also called the '''Beast Planet''' on occasion) is a fictional planet home to Beast [[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]] in the animated television program ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]''. It is referred to as '''Animatros''' in the Japanese version of the series ''[[Transformers: Galaxy Force]]''.

The ship that transported the Cyber Planet Key to this world was called [[Hyperborea]]. Home of one of four [[Cyber Planet Key]]s (which exists in the form of a statue called the Beast Totem) and ancient Transformer colonies sent to reacquire them. The Beast Totem is in a temple where there are different wall carvings of Earth's animal life. All of Jungle Planet's inhabitants have animal alternate forms. Jungle Planet is a lush, green planet that contains dangerous volcanic activity, dangerous seismic activity, [[Thunderstorm|lightning storms]], and monstrous sentient plant. The Jungle Planet Transformers took animal alternate modes.

For a time, the Jungle Planet Transformers were leaderless leaving their world torn by violence and poverty. Many were taken under the tutelage under [[Zen]]-master [[Backstop (Transformers)|Backstop]] in the way of non-violence and self-defense. Eventually, [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]], a student of Backstop, grew impatient with his people's suffering and forced a rebellion against those taking advantage of the chaos, strong-arming his way into leadership position in a series of battles to determine who would be strong enough to become leader. Corrupted by his new-found power and position, Scourge forced a "peace through tyranny" campaign, bringing his people the peace and prosperity he promised them, but only through a dictatorship ruled by the credo of "might makes right." However, Scourge couldn't totally rid himself of his old master's teachings and he enforced a strict series of laws regulating disputes being settled only through formal duels of strength with sabotage and especially unjustified death of a defeated foe as the planet's highest offense.

Overhaul was sent to acquire the Cyber Planet Key here while being told not to interact with its inhabitants. This ended up being the opposite when Overhaul was rescued from a seismic activity by Backstop. While protecting Snarl from Scourge and Megatron, Overhaul was transformed into Leobreaker as a result of a combination of tapping into the power of Jungle Planet's Cyber Planet Key and scanning a wall-carving of a [[lion]]. Eventually, Leobreaker, Backstop, and Snarl convinced [[Optimus Prime]] to rethink his credo of non-interaction with local customs in order to acquire the Key.

The ''Hyperborea'' ship would later carry the people of Jungle Planet to safety (along with another ship, [[Ogygia]]), after the planet was consumed by the Black Hole. However, when the Black Hole was destroyed, the planet was restored. When the Autobots attempted to use a gigantic rocket to move the Jungle Planet back into its orbit, Galvatron attacked and damaged the rocket. The Jungle Planet threatened to crash into Cybertron. The combined strength of Scourge, the Autobots, the former Decepticons (Dark Crumplezone, Ransack, Thunderblast, and Thundercracker), and their allies from the various planets were able to combine their strength and move the rocket back into place.

Known inhabitants of Jungle Planet include:

* '''[[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]]''' - The [[dictator]] of Jungle Planet, a former student of Backstop, and an old friend of Snarl. He transforms into a quadrupedal [[dragon]].
* '''Snarl''' - A student of Backstop and an old friend of Scourge. He transforms into a [[gray wolf]].
* '''Backstop''' - A wise [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]] on Jungle Planet and a Zen-master of Scourge, Snarl, and Undermine. He transforms into a [[black rhinoceros]].
* '''Undermine''' - An enforcer of Scourge and the brother of Repugnus. He transforms into a [[Spinosaurus]].
* '''Brimstone''' - An enforcer of Scourge. He transforms into a [[Pteranodon]].
* '''Wreckloose''' - An enforcer of Scourge who only appeared in the toyline. He transforms into a [[Komodo dragon]].
* '''Repugnus''' - An inhabitant of a swamp near the Steel Shard Mountains and the brother of Undermine. Unlike Undermine, Repugnus doesn't agree with Scourge's methods. He transforms into a [[Spinosaurus]].
* '''Shrapnel''' - He was referenced on Undermine's Cyber Key bio.

Also on Jungle Planet are generic Transformers that each resemble a different animal such as a [[Brontosaurus]], an [[owl]], a [[lobster]], a [[deer]], a [[giraffe]], and a tropical bird.

==Junkion==
'''Junkion''', also known as '''the Planet of Junk''' is the home planet of the Junkions, a group of Transformers who transform into motorcycles. The planet and the Junkions first appeared in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. It is not really a planet in the normal sense of the word, but rather, a landfill in space that has accumulated enough mass to be held together by gravity. Depending on the storyline, it has been depicted as either a traditional spherical planet or as an elongated slab. In the original movie art and storyboards, the Planet of Junk was intended to be a spherical planet, with several rounded slabs seeming to rise off of its surface. In the end, only the "northernmost" rounded section of the planetoid was retained on film. In the third volume of the Devil's due comics the android [[Serpentor]] downloaded information on the history of [[Cybertron]] from [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]]. Mentioned among that information was the [[Quintessons]], [[Alpha Trion]], [[Megatron]] and Soundwave, the planet of Junk, a warrior named [[Optimus Primal]] and the [[Matrix of Leadership|Autobot Matrix of Leadership]]. In ''[[Transformers: Exiles]]'', the Autobots aboard the Ark come upon the planet Junkion where they meet [[Wreck-Gar]] and the other Junkions. It is later discovered that Junkion is made up of the wreckage of various ships drawn together by the gravity of the [[Requiem Blaster]], and subsequently ripped apart when the blaster is stolen by the Decepticons.

Known inhabitants of Junkion are:

* '''[[Wreck-Gar]]''' - Leader of the Junkions in most continuities, Wreck-Gar is a curious robot with a mustache and a beard. In the Generation 1 continuity, he–like most Junkions–turns into a motorcycle and is incredibly resilient, able to quickly put himself back together after being damaged. He and all the Junkions learned how to speak English from human television broadcasts received across space, and as such when they talk they typically do in quotations from television, such as "Offer expires while you wait-operators are standing by." In ''Transformers: Exiles'', Wreck-Gar turns into a Cybertronian garbage truck and speaks by shouting, often necessary when operating near his planet's smelting furnaces. He forms an uneasy alliance with the Autobots when they arrived on the planet, but proves less accommodating when their conflict with Megatron rips the planet apart. He and several other Junkions are later captured by Thundertron and the Star Seekers, a band of pirates, and forced to build a space bridge into their vessel, the ''Tidal Wave.'' In ''[[Transformers: Retribution]]'', Wreck-Gar is used to lure the Decepticons into a Star Seeker trap, but takes advantage of the confusion to escape and make his way back to Junkion.
* '''Junkyard''' - Junkyard is unlike most junkions, and usually speaks quite normally using just plain English, without referencing TV shows or media. He is a very skilled in business and is a very skilled technician. Direct combat is not his forte. Junkyard is also known as Junkheap.
* '''Scrapheap''' - Scrapheap is a rebellious junkion, whose average day is racing motorcycles in knock down rallies. Like most junkions he is usually quoting TV and media. He wants to start a career of his home planet, and will do whatever it takes to make it happen.
*  '''Nancy''' - Nancy is a Junkion who appears to be the consort of the Junkion leader, Wreck-Gar, and seems to have some sort of relationship with a him as well. Nancy just like all Junkions can be blasted to pieces without taking any noticeable permanent damage, and is capable of repairing herself within seconds. Nancy is the only known female junkion, and the only transformer with a human name.
* '''Pinion''' - A Junkion tasked with loaded junk into a furnace for recycling. He was later revealed to be one of the components of [[Nexus Prime (Transformers)|Nexus Prime]].
* '''Axer''' - Not a true Junkion, but rather a Decepticon bounty hunter stranded on the artificial planet by an accident with a wrecked ship. Axer professed loyalty to Megatron, but was reluctant to share all his information with his supposed leader. He was later captured by the Star Seekers near the end of ''Exiles'', but helped Wreck-Gar escape in order to effect his own return to the Decepticons in ''Retribution.'' Unfortunately, Megatron had little use for the double-agent, and turned him over to Soundwave for torture.
* '''Shearbolt''' - A Junkion who was found murdered by the Autobots after being impersonated by Makeshift, the Decepticon Shifter.
* '''Detritus''' - A close advisor to Wreck-Gar.
* '''Cannonspring''' - One of Nexus Prime's components, whose ship ended up on Junkion after a space bridge accident. Apparently killed, he was revived in the close proximity of Pinion, Chaindrive, Clocker, and Mainspring, and the five of them reunited into their true form.

==Jörmungandr==
'''Jörmungandr''' is a [[Snake|serpent]]-shaped planet. It was featured in the ''Beast Wars Neo'' manga where it was Cohrada's homeworld.

==Kaiba-5==
'''Kaiba-5''' is a planet that was referenced in ''[[Transformers: The Game]]''.

==Klo==
'''Klo''' appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]] ''[[Transformers (comics)|Transformers]]'' comic book series, and is notable for being the location of the final battle of both the U.S. and UK versions of the series. Klo was introduced in issue #80 in the U.S. version,&lt;ref name="TFArchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfarchive.com/comics/marvel/?s=us_71_80#80|title=TFArchive - Transformers Comics - Marvel Comics Guide|work=tfarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and #331 in the UK version.&lt;ref name="TFArchive"/&gt; Klo is a beautiful, peaceful planet, rich in natural resources and inhabited by benign, harmless creatures called Klozians. The planet was invaded by [[Decepticon]]s under [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]]'s leadership, after the [[Transformers]] had won the war against [[Unicron]]. Following Unicron's death, [[Cybertron]] seemed to be in danger of being destroyed, so the Decepticons fled the planet in search of new worlds to conquer. They selected Klo, where they started mercilessly slaughtering the native Klozians. The [[Autobot]]s tracked the Decepticons to Klo and attempted to rescue the Klozians, but weak leadership from [[Grimlock]] led to heavy casualties by the Autobots and their forces were nearly wiped out. Finally, a newly resurrected [[Optimus Prime]] and the Last Autobot arrived on Klo, and while Optimus Prime fought against Bludgeon, the Last Autobot resurrected the dead Autobots. Facing invincible opposition, Bludgeon and his Decepticons retreated back into space and Optimus Prime and his Autobots stayed to help the Klozians rebuild their planet.

==Lanarq==
'''Lanarq''' is a robotic planet who waged a centuries-long war with Xetaxxis.

==Lithone==
'''Lithone''' was a planet populated by intelligent Transformer-like machine life. It was destroyed by [[Unicron]] in the Earth year 2005. The last known survivor of the planet, Kranix, was sentenced to death and executed by the [[Quintesson]]s after being found "innocent" of an unspecified crime (It is rumored that the [[Quintesson]]s often judge lifeforms with the crime of "stealing" Cybertron from them 12 million years prior, as seen in the Five Faces of Darkness miniseries, but Kranix was from Lithone, so the "jury reach a verdict" of innocent—yet Kup and Hot Rod, of Cybertron, were found innocent in the film as well).

In the script and in the Marvel Comics ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'' adaptation, the Lithonians could transform into [[starship|spaceships]]. Lithone has also been referenced as "Glithos" or "Glinthos" due to the unclear articulation of its last surviving native, Kranix, before his execution.

==Lucifer==
'''Lucifer''' is a planet that is under the control of the Decepticons.

==LV-117==
'''LV-117''' is a planet in an unknown part of space that contains dangerous robot-eating animals.

==Master==
'''Master''' is a planet that appeared in the Japanese continuity as the home planet of the [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmasters]] and [[Targetmasters]].

==Menonia==
'''Menonia''' is a planet that exists in an alternate dimension as seen in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "Madman's Paradise." Its technology is based on Earth's Middle Ages and magic is prominent here. Known inhabitants of Menonina include [[List of avian humanoids|Bird People]], [[Dragon]]s, Humans, Reptile-Birds (a [[Dragon]]/[[Pterosaur]] creature), Tree-[[Centaur]]s (a race of centaur/[[ent]] creatures), and Wood Men.

==Moriturus==
'''Moriturus''' is a planet that was consumed by the Unicron Singularity.

==Mumu-Obscura==
'''Mumu-Obscura''' was a militarily contested and strategically significant world in the Eigerson-48 star system, until a group of warriors called the Reapers exterminated its population and poisoned its resources. It was featured in IDW Comics.

==Nebulos==
'''Nebulos''', sometimes known as '''Nebulon''', is a [[planet]] in the [[fiction]]al [[Transformers universes]].

Nebulos is a somewhat [[Earth]]-like planet far away from both Earth and [[Cybertron]], and is the home to a [[human]]oid race known as the Nebulans. The planet and its inhabitants were first introduced as the back story for [[Hasbro]]'s new [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmaster]] and [[Targetmaster]] toys, later expanded by the [[Powermaster (Transformers)|Powermaster]] toys. These toys are [[robot]]s that transform into [[vehicle]]s or [[animal]]s, and include Nebulan sidekicks that transform into the robot's head, into a [[weapon]], or into the vehicle's [[engine]]. The toys themselves never expanded on Nebulon or its inhabitants, but both the TV series (in its fourth and final season) and the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Transformers (comics)|comic book]] did, with drastically different, mutually inconsistent versions. In the TV series, the Nebulons were shown to be green-skinned. The planet Nebulos does not exist in the Japanese continuation of the franchise. Thus, with no Nebulos and no Nebulons, a different origin was given for the Headmaster and Targetmaster Transformers.

In the Marvel comic book, Fortress Maximus had grown weary of the [[civil war]] on Cybertron, and led a group of Autobots in search of a new planet where they could live in peace. They settled on Nebulos, but the Decepticons followed them. The comic book version of Nebulos is an idyllic, peaceful world where [[war]] has long since been discontinued and all weapons have been locked away. It is governed by a council of peers. The arrival of the Transformers scared the Nebulans, and they were forced to hold an emergency council meeting to deal with these strange new creatures. The Autobots wanted to live in peace with the Nebulans, but the Decepticons wanted to conquer them and kill the Autobots, so the Autobot-Decepticon civil war restarted on Nebulon. Both sides allied themselves with Nebulans, the Autobots generally with common people who had become familiar with them and did not see them as a threat, and the Decepticons generally with [[criminal]]s or corrupt [[politician]]s. The Nebulans, fearing the Transformers' civil war would plunge their own world back into war, finally banished the Transformers and their Nebulan sidekicks back into space, where they finally arrived on Earth.

In the TV series, the Transformers arrived on Nebulos in the three-part episode ''The Rebirth'', which were the only episodes of the fourth season, and the last episode ever produced in the United States. The [[Autobot]]s' spaceship was plunged to Nebulos accidentally by a gigantic [[Voltage spike|power surge]] from the [[Plasma Energy Chamber]], and the [[Decepticon]]s followed them. The TV show version of Nebulos is a hostile, dying world, where a group of eleven rulers known as "[[Hive (Transformers)|The Hive]]" controls the entire world from an underground city, abusing their power for their personal pleasure and oppressing the workers with various [[mechanics|mechanical]] devices controlled by their minds. Upon seeing the Autobots, the Nebulon workers mistook them for machines controlled by The Hive, and imprisoned them, later to destroy them. However, an attack by the Decepticons convinced the workers that the Autobots were good guys, and so they were released and allied themselves with the workers. The Decepticons did the same with the members of The Hive (after being co-erced).

In the Ladybird books continuity, the Nebulans were a race of small transforming robots. The Nebulans have appeared once more in [[IDW Publishing]]'s new continuity, in [[The Transformers: Stormbringer]]. Their planet was attacked by [[Thunderwing]] as part of an unholy pact to rejuvenate Cybertron. Despite the best efforts of the local Decepticon cell (led by [[Dreadwind]] and [[Darkwing]]) much of the planet was devastated. It also appeared chronologically earlier in the [[The Transformers: Spotlight|Spotlight]] issue on [[Ultra Magnus]], where [[Scorponok]] was already seen to be developing the [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmaster]] process. Nebulos was also mentioned by [[Swindle (Transformers)|Swindle]] in the ''[[Transformers Animated]]'' episode, ''Decepticon Air''.

Nebulos is also featured in several stories of the "Ask [[Vector Prime]]" [[Facebook]] feature. Among these were the ''Armada'' storyline, in which the Nebulans Hi-Q and Arcana were responsible for Overload and Rollout being merged into a Headmaster being in order to save them both from debilitating medical conditions,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/AskVectorPrime/posts/725582070907099&lt;/ref&gt; and a split reality in which the monstrous Zarak Maximus was born from the fusion of Mo Zarak with the remains of Fortress Maximus and Scorponok.

***'''Stylor'''
***'''Arcana'''
***'''Duros'''
***'''Gort'''
**'''The Hive'''
***'''Zarak''' - The evil leader of the Hive and creator of the Decepticon Headmaster giant [[Scorponok]].

==New Kaon==
'''New Kaon''' is a planet where all kinds of Decepticons that are fleeing from the Autobots take refuge. It was featured in the comic book tie-in to ''[[Transformers Animated]]''.

==Ocean Planet==
In ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', '''Ocean Planet''' was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It is mostly covered in an ocean.

==Paradise==
'''Paradise''' is a planet that is a natural wonderland of vast [[jungle]]s, roaring [[river]]s and [[waterfall]]s, smoking [[volcano]]es, and beasts of all shapes and sizes, all co-existing in harmony with the tribes of human-like beings living there. Although choosing to live a primitive existence dressing in robes made from animal skins and living in yurts, the people of the planet Paradise defy appearances by being intelligent, well-spoken creatures.

In the ''Transformers: Headmasters'' episode "Head Formation of Friendship," Paradise was targeted by Galvatron and the Decepticons who were on a quest to drain the energy from planets until they are driven away by the Autobots.

==Paradron==
'''Paradron''' is a peaceful, Energon-rich planet, accessible only through a vortex. Several Autobots fled there when the war against the Decepticons began and set up a colony there. The Autobot [[Sandstorm (Transformers)|Sandstorm]] was one of the inhabitants of this planet. It was featured in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "Fight or Flee" when the Decepticons discovered this planet and enslaved the pacifist Autobots. After the Autobots rescued the pacifist Autobots, Rodimus Prime had Paradron destroyed with most of its inhabitants being transferred to Cybertron.

In [[Fun Publications]]' ''Shattered Glass'' storyline, Paradron was a prison planet where Optimus Prime exiled some of his more dangerous Autobot enemies, including Ultra Magnus and Wreck-Gar.

==Pequod==
'''Pequod''' is an oceanic planet that is home to large [[whale]]-like creatures called the Klud. It was featured in Marvel Comics.

==Pirate Planet==
'''Pirate Planet''' is a planet where [[space pirate]]s of all kinds store their loot.

==Plains Planet==
In ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', '''Plains Planet''' (also called '''Grass Planet''') was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It is mostly filled with grasslands.

==Planet Q==
'''Planet Q''' is a desert planet that was featured in ''[[Transformers: Energon]]''. It was home to Alpha Q, Scorponok, and the Terrorcons, and was consumed by Unicron prior to the start of the series. Alpha Q's desire to restore his home planet using Unicron's power served as his primary motivation throughout ''Energon'', and was also the reason for Rodimus' willingness to work with him.

==Planet X==
'''Planet X''' is the name of two different planets in the ''Transformers Universe, the first of which was seen in ''[[Transformers: Victory]]''.

The Planet X featured in ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'' was first seen in a recording found by the human Lori and the Velocitronian leader, Override, after the latter's battle with [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]] on Giant Planet. It was shown to be a highly advanced world like Cybertron, purple in color, with two golden rings around it forming an X pattern. Later, it would be revealed that Planet X was the dominant force in the alternate universe that Giant Planet had been drawn into. It was capable of non-orbital space travel and annihilating less advanced civilizations it came across. This, however, caused life in its universe to 'die' and, in an attempt to rectify the problem, its denizens sought out another life-rich planet to subjugate. The planet they found, Giant Planet, did not take kindly to being invaded, and its inhabitants reformatted themselves into larger forms with help of the Cyber Planet Key in order to combat the threat of the off-worlders.

Left with few options and little hope of victory, the inhabitants of Planet X powered up their ultimate weapon: a [[Death Star]]-like planetary cannon, in order to wipe out the transformers on Giant Planet. Unfortunately, the cannon was too powerful for them to control and the result destroyed their world. The survivors, including [[Soundwave (Transformers)#Transformers: Cybertron|Soundwave]] and [[Sideways (Transformers)#Transformers: Cybertron|Sideways]], were scattered all across their universe, and were eventually thrown into the Transformers' proper universe.  Believing Giant Planet to be at fault for their home planet's destruction, the various Transformers plotted revenge against them. In addition, the Giant Planet Transformers also felt at least partially responsible for Planet X's annihilation. This created their custom of building cities and then abandoning them, which became a perpetual, planet-wide act of penance. Eventually, Sideways and Soundwave managed to return to Giant Planet, and sought the [[Cyber Planet Keys]] in order to exact their revenge.

"Ask [[Vector Prime]]" would later feature Planet X in additional storylines, often involving its origin. In one reality, it was the broken body of Unicron from ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', shunted into another dimension by the energies of the Matrix of Leadership. Arriving on the edge of the Earth solar system of that reality, Unicron set out to repair himself but was hindered by the actions of Megatron utilizing a Star Harvester. As in the ''Energon'' series, Unicron revived many of the Transformers he had previously consumed in an effort to expedite his recovery, and the new race renamed their home Planet X. They then traveled to the world of the ''Victory'' series and attacked it, but the efforts of the Autobots using Zone energy split the planet into two: the beautiful world seen in ''Victory'' and one virtually identical to the ''Cybertron'' version, which was later destroyed by the inhabitants of an alternate Gigantion known as Gigalonia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/AskVectorPrime/posts/673768952755078&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions included a ''Cybertron'' Planet X that was once part of the Liege Maximo's Cybertronian Empire, and another in which Planet X was once the home of a smaller scale Unicron who used a cyber key to unite himself with his former homeworld and domain.

==Thrull==
'''Thrull''' is the planet that Galavatron ended up on after being thrown out of Unicron as seen in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "The Five Faces of Darkness" Pt. 1. An inhospitable world consisting of plasma lava and rock, its environment led to the degradation of Galvatron's logic circuits, making him even more unstable and dangerous than he had been previously. Upon being revived and escaping the planet, Galvatron fired an energy blast that caused Thrull to explode.

==Torkulon==
'''Torkulon''' is a planet whose main source of commerce is [[psychotherapy]]. [[Galvatron]] was brought there for treatment in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "Webworld", following his increasingly erratic behavior following the event of ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. The entire planet was a living computer whose circuitry was woven by arachnid-like beings known as the Alya, and manipulated by a furry humanoid race of size comparable to the Transformers themselves. Despite multiple methods used, the Torkulon were unable to cure Galvatron, who madness infected the planet and caused it to go out of control. Galvatron himself then destroyed the Torkulon computer core, leaving the planet devastated, though with the possibility of rebuilding.

==Twin Star==
'''Twin Star''' is a group of two diametrically opposed planets Sperity and Tourin. It was featured in ''[[Transformers: Headmasters]]''.

* '''Sperity''' is rich in energy and covered in glistening cities that are inhabited by small robots.

==Unicron==
{{Main|Unicron}}
'''Unicron''' is a fictional character from the [[Transformers universes|''Transformers'' universe]] and [[Transformers (toyline)|toyline]]. Created by [[Floro Dery]], he was introduced in the 1986 animated film ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A brief history of the Transformers |work=Malaysia Star |date= |url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2004/11/9/features/20041108160036&amp;sec=features |accessdate=2010-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622055026/http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=%2F2004%2F11%2F9%2Ffeatures%2F20041108160036&amp;sec=features |archivedate=2011-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reprised that role in Atari's 2003 [[Transformers (2003 video game)|Transformers video game]]. Unicron is a prodigiously large robot whose scale reaches planetary proportions, and he is also able to transform into a mechanical [[planet]]. Unicron's origin has expanded over the years from simply being a large robot to being a God of chaos who devours realities. He often employs the help of [[Decepticons]] in his work. In some stories, he is considered part of the origin of the Decepticon forces.

==Varas Centralus==
'''Varas Centralus''' is a planet situated in the Kol star system. It is featured in IDW Comics.

==Vehicon==
:''For the Transformers group, see [[Vehicon]]''.

'''Vehicon''' is a planet where Reverse Convoy is the leader of the Autobots.

==Velocitron==
'''Velocitron''' (known as '''Speedia''' in ''Galaxy Force'' and '''Speed Planet''' in promotional materials) is a [[fiction]]al planet featured in ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'' and is the location of one of four ancient Transformer colonies that lost contact with the home world of [[Cybertron]] long ago, along with [[Earth (Transformers)|Earth]], Jungle Planet, and Gigantion. Each of these colonies possess a [[Cyber Planet Key]], containing a fragment of the power of [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]]. The name Velocitron is used infrequently. The planet is more commonly referred to as "the Speed Planet" or simply "Speed Planet." The planet's full, formal name appears to be "Velocitron, the Speed Planet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panelsonpages.com/?p=5401|title=Rolling Out for 25 Years – Cybertron|work=Panels on Pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variable [[desert]] planet, it was [[terraformed]] into a global race track with the pursuit of perfect speed and performance the primary motivating force in its society and culture. Disputes are settled in formal races with the winner claiming victory over the dispute as well. Automated repair machines maintain the race courses, which include tracks featuring various environments and obstacles as well as simpler straightforward courses. Characteristics of Velocitron's inhabitants include translucent wheels of unknown material, and double-barrelled long-range weaponry.

The planet's leader is [[Override (Transformers)|Override]] as she is the fastest of all Velocitronian Transformers with no equal planetside. She holds semi-annual planetwide races to determine the next leader with the planet's Cyber Planet Key (which exists in the form of a trophy called the Planet Cup) awarded to the winner. The location of Velocitron was first re-discovered by [[Megatron]] using the map he had stolen from [[Vector Prime]]. Vector Prime himself later located the planet as well, by studying a copy of the Atlantis Pattern found at a museum in Mexico.

[[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]] felt right at home on the planet and participated in the planet-wide race alongside a few of his [[Autobot]] comrades, despite reservations by [[Optimus Prime]] who advised them not to interact with any of the inhabitants. Despite quarreling with his companion [[Red Alert (Transformers)|Red Alert]], Hot Shot managed to overcome the challenges of Speed Planet and won the great race. In addition to gaining Override's friendship, the Autobots also learned a valuable lesson about interacting with the inhabitants of the different planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crushable.com/entertainment/transformers-cybertron-dvd-review/|title="Transformers Cybertron": DVD review|work=Crushable}}&lt;/ref&gt; The starship that carried the Cyber Planet Key to this world was named ''[[Ogygia]]''.

In the final episode of ''Transformers: Cybertron'' the "''Speedia 500''" race is held to determine the leader of Velocitron, which Hot Shot wins. [[Dirt Boss]] comes in second, Ransack in third, Dark Crumplezone in fourth, Brakedown in fifth, and Clocker in sixth. Override didn't even compete, as she joins the new Space Bridge project led by Optimus Prime. The name of the race is a reference to the Japanese name of the planet, which is Speedia.

Velocitron is one of the planets mentioned in the first chapter of ''[[Transformers: Exodus]]'' in which many Cybertronians are populated. The sequel novel ''[[Transformers: Exiles]]'' features Optimus Prime and the other Autobots aboard the ''Ark'' coming to Velocitron where they meet Blurr and Override. Velocitronians are obsessed with speed, so that their lives are centered around going faster or helping others race. The Autobots soon discover a war brewing on Velocitron between Override and Ransack, the former sympathizing with the Autobots while the latter finds Decepticon philosophies more appealing. The two sides soon see conflict, and after the Ark's departure are visited not only by Megatron and the Decepticons but also by a group of pirates known as the Star Seekers under Thundertron. Velocitron in this continuity is also threatened by the instability of its sun, which is threatening to go supernova.

''[[Transformers: Rescue Bots]]'' included a mention of Velocitron by that series' version of Blurr, who notes that it consists of "all roads, no speed limits."

Known inhabitants of Velocitron are:

* '''Override''' - A female Transformer and the leader of Velocitron. In ''Cybertron'' Override refuses to turn over the Cyber Planet Key to anyone unless they can win the planet's biggest race. After the Autobots succeed, she joins their cause throughout the rest of the series. In ''Exiles'', she and Ransack are the rival rulers of the planet and their disputes turn into armed conflict shortly after the arrival of the Autobots. Despite this, she fights bravely against Ransack's forces, an invading crew of pirates, and even the arrival of the Decepticons.
* '''Brakedown''' - The oldest living inhabitant of Velocitron.
* '''Clocker''' - A young inhabitant of Velocitron that is often seen with Brakedown in ''Cybertron''. In ''Exiles'', he quickly becomes attached to the Autobots and departs Velocitron with them along with Mainspring. He was later revealed to be one of the five components of [[Nexus Prime (Transformers)|Nexus Prime]].
* '''Crumplezone''' - An inhabitant of Velocitron who was recruited by Megatron.
* '''Dirt Boss''' - An inhabitant of Velocitron who temporarily sided with the Decepticons.
* '''Ransack''' - An inhabitant of Velocitron who was recruited by Megatron in ''Cybertron.'' In the novel ''Exiles'', he is one of two leaders of Velocitron and quickly expresses Decepticon sympathies. When Megatron arrives he initially believes that the two of them will be equals, but Megatron quickly makes it clear that he is in command.
* '''Skyfall''' -
* '''Swerve''' -
* '''Mainspring''' - A Velocitronian mechanic loyal to Override and part of Blurr's pit crew. He later left Velocitron with the Ark and was subsequently revealed to be one of Nexus Prime's components.
* '''Hightail''' - One of Ransack's loyalists in ''Exiles'', Hightail believes that he previously went by another name but forgot it after long ages.
* '''Armco''' - A Velocitronian welder with no strong allegiance to either Ransack or Override. He was later contacted by the Autobot Prowl and asked to provide information in the event that Megatron's agent-not known at that time to be the Shifter Makeshitft-gave specifics on when Megatron would be arriving on the planet.
* '''Backfire''' - Another of Ransack's flunkies, Backfire warmed to the Decepticon cause due to feeling oppressed by Velocitron's social order, where only the fastest competitors would receive sponsorship. He found work as a mechanic, but found it degrading since he received only a fraction of the glory he felt he deserved for making the victories of others possible. As such, he hoped that under Megatron's regime he would be treated as he deserved. His enthusiasm prompted Makeshift, Megatron's spy aboard the Ark, to make him Megatron's contact amongst Ransack's forces.
* '''Blueshift''' - One of Override's engineers in ''Exiles.''
* '''[[Blurr]]''' - A racer native to Velocitron only in the ''[[Transformers: Prime]]'' continuity. One of Velocitron's fastest racers-not to mention talkers-he helps the Autobots by providing them with one of the fragments of the Blades of Time, previously built into the Speedia Trophy. When hostilities break out on Velocitron, he becomes a firm supporter of Override.
* '''Syncol''' - A Velocitronian mechanic who had the misfortune of mistaking [[Starscream]] for [[Silverbolt]] when the former arrived on Velocitron. Fortunately, after being questioned by the Seeker and Megatron, he was allowed to go free.

==Vs'Qs==
'''Vs'Qs''' is actually a moon, not a planet. Vs'Qs is a barren, desolate place, devoid of any natural life. Vs'Qs was the place where the body of [[Optimus Prime]] happened to land on, having been blasted off into space randomly after his death. The [[Matrix of Leadership]] contained within the body was found during the [[Matrix Quest]].

==Wednesday==
'''Wednesday''' is an [[ocean]] planet that is the home of Princess Rage, a Transformer who can turn into a [[jellyfish]]. It was featured in the ''Beast Wars Neo'' manga.

==Xeptos==
'''Xeptos''' is a planet in the Microverse.

==Xetaxxis==
'''Xetaxxis''' is a robotic planet that waged a centuries-long war with Lanark.

==Yst==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7933">'''Lyrical dance''' has been defined as a dance style that embodies various aspects of [[ballet]], [[jazz]], [[acrobatics]], [[Modern dance|modern]], and [[hip hop]], while still maintaining its autonomy. According to Jennifer Foster, “It has been strongly associated with clearly displayed emotional moods, fast-moving choreographic strategies, emphasis on virtuosic display, illustration of song lyrics, and, in group form, exact unison.” &lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fisher |first1=Jennifer |title=When Good Adjective Go Bad: The Case of the So-called Lyrical Dance |journal=Dance Chronicle |date=23 Oct 2014 |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=312-334 |doi=10.1080/01472526.2014.958650 |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/01472526.2014.958650 |accessdate=23 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The style is usually danced at a faster pace than ballet but not as fast as jazz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-lyrical-dance-1007414|title=What Is the Lyrical Dance Style?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;The term “lyrical” dance has been recorded as being used only in the realm of dance competitions, and briefly on the popular television show [[So You Think You Can Dance]] (SYTYCD). &lt;ref name="Weisbrod 1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weisbrod |first1=Alexis |title=Defining Dance, Creating Commodity: The Rhetoric of So You Think You Can Dance |journal=The Oxford Handbook of Dance and the Popular Screen |date=Oct 2014 |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199897827.013.021 |url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199897827.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199897827-e-021?rskey=MFSNAU&amp;result=1#oxfordhb-9780199897827-e-021-bibliography-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History'''

The history of lyrical dance has not been as clearly documented as other styles of dance. There is little research and documentation of the origins of lyrical dance most likely due to the limited use of this style outside of the competition dance world.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; There are three popular origin stories for lyrical dance that have been suggested by experts of competition dance. The first, speculated by Jimmy Peters, is that lyrical dance evolved from the “dream ballet” in musicals such as Oklahoma and West Side Story. The second from Chelya Clawson, states that this term can be traced back to 16th century traditional Indian dance. The last, and the most plausible, created by Phyllis Balanga- Demoret, is that it began about 25 years ago as a result of ballet’s inability to take to the competition stage.&lt;ref name="Weisbrod 2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weisbrod |first1=Alexis |title=dance: Redefining Dance in the United States |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6924g6c6 |website=UC Riverside |publisher=eScholarship |accessdate=23 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though there has been no official documentation, Balanga-Demoret’s explanation is the most plausible because lyrical dance is only used in competition dance. Additionally, ballet is rarely seen on a competitive stage, despite it having its own category at many competitions, which further confirms Balanga- Demoret’s theory.
Dancer, teacher, and choreographer Suzi Taylor, who holds regular classes at Steps on Broadway in [[New York City]], is considered by many to be an early mother of lyrical dance, having emphasized a unique brand of musicality and expressiveness which influenced many future teachers and choreographers.&lt;ref&gt;''Matisse Dance with Joy''by Susan Goldman Rubin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dance Teacher, The Practical Magazine of Dance''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Jen. "America'S Sweetheart." Dance Spirit 13.9 (2009): 64-68. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. 31 Jan. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The styles within lyrical dance have changed overtime. In the earlier stages, a dancer would perform the lyrics of a song, displaying emotions. Today, the lyrical category still has an emphasis on displaying emotion but in a more abstract way. The lyrical category is a place for innovation and stylized movement that is associated with contemporary dance. &lt;ref name="Weisbrod 2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weisbrod |first1=Alexis |title=dance: Redefining Dance in the United States |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6924g6c6 |website=UC Riverside |publisher=eScholarship |accessdate=23 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical dancing is performed to music with lyrics to inspire movements to express strong feelings and emotions the choreographer feels from the lyrics in the chosen song.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dance.about.com/od/typesofdance/f/Lyrical_Dance.htm/ What is Lyrical Dance? --About.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617124738/http://dance.about.com/od/typesofdance/f/Lyrical_Dance.htm |date=2015-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because lyrical dancing focuses on the expression of strong emotion, the style concentrates more on individual approach and expressiveness than the precision of the dancer's movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dance.lovetoknow.com/Lyrical_Dancing/ Lyrical Dancing --lovetoknow.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403192724/http://dance.lovetoknow.com/Lyrical_Dancing |date=2015-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, there is not as much focus on the choreography, and, in fact, the choreography often exists only as a general guide for the dancer, not as a routine that has to be exactly followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-lyrical-dance-1007414|title=What Is the Lyrical Dance Style?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Style vs Technique'''

Because of the links between the styles of dance, teachers originally struggled with whether to teach lyrical dance alongside jazz or ballet or as its own, separate style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://the-dancers-amoung-us.weebly.com/history-of-lyrical-and-contemporary.html|title=History of Lyrical and Contemporary|website=The History Of Dance|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main concerns with lyrical dance is the distinction between lyrical as a style and/or a technique. Lyrical has been described  as a “pseudostyle” or a “pseudogenre” &lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt;because it utilizes steps from other, more established styles of dance. Lyrical dance utilizes training from jazz technique, ballet technique, and modern technique as a basis for movement. &lt;ref name="Weisbrod 2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weisbrod |first1=Alexis |title=dance: Redefining Dance in the United States |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6924g6c6 |website=UC Riverside |publisher=eScholarship |accessdate=23 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These well-known movements are elongated, taken off their center, and distorted to create a new aesthetic in lyrical. Although advertised by some studios as a class, “lyrical technique” does not technically exist. A dancer cannot be proficient in lyrical dance without knowledge and mastery of basic technique from jazz, ballet, and modern. &lt;ref name="Weisbrod 1" /&gt;


'''Use in Popular Culture'''

Lyrical dance is competition dance jargon and is only used to describe a specific style of dance in the world of competitive dance. “Lyrical” is used to describe a quality or movement type in other dance settings, but not as a style name such as Jazz or Ballet. There has only been one instance of lyrical being used in a professional setting. This was on Season 1 of the popular American dance show So You Think You Can Dance. Contestants on this reality show were asked to compete in many different styles such as ballroom, hip-hop, jazz, and lyrical. The term lyrical was replaced by the term contemporary in Season 2 of the show. This was thought to have been done to professionally legitimize this show. Despite the name change, the type of dances performed in this style remain very similar. &lt;ref name="Weisbrod 1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4805">'''Macedonian art''' is the art of the [[Macedonian Renaissance]] in [[Byzantine art]].  The period followed the end of the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] and lasted until the fall of the [[Macedonian dynasty]], which ruled the [[Byzantine Empire]] from 867 to 1056, having originated in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] in the [[Balkans]].  It coincided with the [[Ottonian Renaissance]] in [[Western Europe]].  In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Byzantine Empire's military situation improved, and art and architecture revived. 
[[File:Byzantinischer Maler um 920 002.jpg|thumb|Scenes from the [[Paris Psalter]]]]

==Painting and mosaic==
New churches were again commissioned, and the Byzantine church mosaic style became standardised. The best preserved examples are at the [[Hosios Lukas]] Monastery in mainland [[Greece]] and the [[Nea Moni of Chios|Nea Moni]] [[Katholikon]] in the island of [[Chios]].  The very freely painted [[fresco]]s at [[Castelseprio]] in Italy are linked by many art historians to the art of Constantinople of the period also.  

There was a revival of interest in classical Greco-Roman styles and subjects, of which the [[Paris Psalter]] is an important testimony, and more sophisticated techniques were used to depict human figures. There was also a naturalistic style and more complex techniques from ancient Greek and Roman art mixed with Christian themes used in art.

==Sculpture==
Although monumental sculpture is extremely rare in Byzantine art, the Macedonian period saw the unprecedented flourishing of the art of [[ivory]] sculpture. Many ornate ivory [[triptych]]s and [[diptych]]s survive, with the central panel often representing either [[deesis]] (as in the [[Harbaville Triptych]]) or the [[Theotokos]] (as in a triptych at [[Luton Hoo]], dating from the reign of [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nicephorus Phocas]]). On the other hand, ivory [[casket]]s (notably the Veroli Casket from [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]) often feature secular motifs true to the Hellenistic tradition, thus testifying to an undercurrent of classical taste in Byzantine art.

There are few important surviving buildings from the period. It is presumed that [[Basil I]]'s votive church of the [[Theotokos of the Pharos]] (no longer extant) served as a model for most [[cross-in-square]] sanctuaries of the period, including the monastery church of [[Hosios Lukas]] in Greece (ca. 1000), the [[Nea Moni of Chios]] (a pet project of [[Constantine IX]]), and the [[Daphni Monastery]] near [[Athens]] (ca. 1050).

== What is science fiction? ==
{{main article|Science fiction}}

* [[Definitions of science fiction]]: Science fiction includes such a wide range of themes and subgenres that it is notoriously difficult to define.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Patrick Parrinder comments that "[d]efinitions of science fiction are not so much a series of logical approximations to an elusive ideal, as a small, parasitic subgenre in themselves."  {{cite book
| first=Patrick 
| last=Parrinder
| authorlink= Patrick Parrinder
|title=Science Fiction: Its Criticism and Teaching
| publisher=New Accents
| location=London
| year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, there have been many definitions offered.

Science fiction is a type of:brendan

* [[Fiction]]&amp;nbsp;– form of narrative which deals, in part or in whole, with events that are not factual, but rather, imaginary and invented by its author(s). Although fiction often describes a major branch of literary work, it is also applied to theatrical, cinematic, and musical work.

The '''''Parnassus''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] painter [[Andrea Mantegna]], executed in 1497. It is housed in the [[Musée du Louvre]] of [[Paris]].

==History==
The ''Parnassus'' was the first picture painted by Mantegna for [[Isabella d'Este]]'s ''[[studiolo of Isabella d'Este|studiolo]]'' (cabinet) in the [[Ducal Palace, Mantua|Ducal Palace]] of [[Mantua]]. The shipping of the paint used by Mantegna for the work is documented in 1497; there is also a letter to Isabella (who was at [[Ferrara]]) informing her that once back she would find the work completed.

The theme was suggested by the court poet [[Paride da Ceresara]]. After Mantegna's death in 1506, the work was partially repainted to update it to the oil technique which had become predominant. The intervention was due perhaps to [[Lorenzo Leonbruno]], and regarded the heads of the Muses, of Apollo, Venus and the landscape.
[[File:Andrea Mantegna 045.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Detail of Vulcan.]]
Together with the other paintings in the ''studiolo'', it was given to [[Cardinal Richelieu]] by Duke [[Charles I of Nevers|Charles I of Mantua]] in 1627, entering the royal collections with [[Louis XIV of France]]. Later it became part of the Louvre Museum.

==Description==
The traditional interpretation of the work is based on a late 15th-century poem by Battista Fiera, which identified it as a representation of [[Mount Parnassus]], culminating in the allegory of Isabella  as [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Francesco II Gonzaga]] as [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]].

The two gods are shown on a natural arch of rocks in front a symbolic bed; in the background the vegetation has many fruits in the right part (the male one) and only one in the left (female) part, symbolizing the fecundation. The posture of Venus derives from the ancient sculpture. They are accompanied by Anteros (the heavenly love), opposed to the carnal one. The latter is still holding the arch, and has a blowpipe which aims at the genitals of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], Venus' husband, portrayed in his workshop in a grotto. Behind him is the grape, perhaps a symbol of the drunk's intemperance.
[[File:Mantegna, parnaso dettaglio 01.jpg|thumb|240px|Detail of Pegasus and Mercury.]]
In a clearing under the arch is [[Apollo]] playing a [[lyre]]. Nine Muses are dancing, in an allegory of universal harmony. According to ancient mythology, her chant could generate earthquakes and other catastrophes, symbolized by the crumbling mountains in the upper left. Such disasters could be cared by [[Pegasus]]' hoof: the horse indeed appears in the right foreground. The touch of his hoof could also generate the spring which fed the falls of [[Mount Helicon]], which can be seen in the background. The Muses danced traditionally in wood of this mount, and thus the traditional naming of Mount Parnassus is wrong.

Near Pegasus is [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], with his traditional winged hat, [[caduceus]] (the winged staff with entwined snakes), and messenger shoes. He is present to protect the two adulterers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2070">'''Paul Palnik''' (born 1946) is a [[Jewish]]-[[United States|American]] [[artist]], [[writer]] and [[educator]].

Born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], Palnik introduced [[kabbalistic]] spiritual themes into his cartoons from the 1970s to the present day.  His cartoons combine graphic design, drawing, poetry and literature. The images are pen and ink drawings often rendered in [[minute]] detail. The cartoons are like one page books,  each dispensing [[wit]], [[wisdom]] and spiritual advice. Palnik Cartoons can be described as being balanced between universal, spiritual, prophetic themes, and the absurd.


Many of Palnik's original drawings are in the collection of [[The Ohio State University]] libraries in [[Columbus, Ohio]] and his work is also represented in the [[Muse Magazine Cartoon Collection from the publishers of The Smithsonian]] in [[Washington DC]]. Numerous large paintings by Palnik are in the collection of [[Camp Ramah (Wisconsin)|Camp Ramah]] in [[Conover, Wisconsin]], where he was artist in residence for 15 years. His paintings strive to depict humanity's relationship with [[God]]. Palnik lives in Columbus, Ohio.

'''Pilipinas Kay Ganda''' ({{literal translation|Philippines, So Beautiful}}) was a short-lived [[advertising campaign]] made by the [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Department of Tourism]] to promote [[Tourism in the Philippines|tourism in the]] [[Philippines]].  Launched in 2010, it replaced the [[WOW Philippines]] campaign that was launched in 2002.

The tourism slogan used in the campaign was controversial and received mostly negative reception from the Filipino public, even leading to the resignation of the country's then-Tourism Secretary, [[Alberto Lim]].  Pilipinas Kay Ganda was eventually replaced with "[[It's More Fun in the Philippines]]".&lt;ref name="absplag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spot.ph/featured/46961/philippines-new-tourism-slogan-pilipinas-kay-ganda-fails-to-impress-netizens |title=New PH tourism slogan "Pilipinas Kay Ganda" fails to impress tourism industry, netizens &amp;#124; The Feed &amp;#124; VIDEOS &amp;#124; SPOT.ph: Your One-Stop Urban Lifestyle Guide to the Best of Manila |publisher=Spot.ph |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dead"&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/21/10/%E2%80%98pilipinas-kay-ganda%E2%80%99-officially-dead&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Conception==
The advertising agency [[Campaigns &amp; Grey]] had advisory capacity over the campaign. The agency design the campaign's logo and theme line.&lt;ref name="absplag"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The agency designed the campaign materials free of charge in support of the President [[Benigno Aquino III]]'s administration. The agency claimed that the released logo was just a study and was released prematurely by the Department of Tourism.&lt;ref name="dead"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged plagiarism==
The Pilipinas Kay Ganda campaign logo design was criticized for alleged plagiarism. Discussions on social media pointed out and suspected that the campaign logo was plagiarized from Poland's own tourism campaign, "Polska" ({{literal translation|Poland}}). The logos of Polska and Pilipinas Kay Ganda's font were similar. Both the letter "L" of the campaign slogans were stylized into trees. The difference is that Pilipinas Kay Ganda's letter "L" was stylized into a coconut tree with a smiley face as opposed to Polska's "L" which was stylized into generic tree.&lt;ref name="absplag"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tourism Secretary [[Alberto Lim]] acknowledged that the Philippine campaign slogan bare some similarities with the Polska logo and commented that the Philippine campaign logo was more colorful. Tourism Undersecretary Enteng Romano, in a text message forwarded by Palace Spokesperson Abi Valte, denied that the Philippine campaign logo was plagiarized and that the logo has enough elements to be distinct from Poland's campaign logo.&lt;ref name="absplag"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OriginalBroadwayCast-1.jpg|thumb|270px|Original Broadway cast, 1996]]
'''''Rent''''' is a [[rock musical]] with music, lyrics, and book by [[Jonathan Larson]],&lt;ref name="Rent: Bible"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; loosely based on [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s [[opera]] ''[[La bohème]]''. It tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists struggling to survive and create a life in [[New York City]]'s [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] in the thriving days of [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] [[Alphabet City, Manhattan|Alphabet City]]&lt;!-- The exact time in which the story takes place is never mentioned but is generally considered to be the early 1990s--&gt;, under the shadow of [[HIV/AIDS]].

The musical was first seen in a [[workshop production]] at [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in 1993. This same [[Off-Broadway]] theatre was also the musical's initial home following its official 1996 opening. The show's creator, [[Jonathan Larson]], died suddenly of an [[aortic dissection]], believed to have been caused by undiagnosed [[Marfan syndrome]], the night before the Off-Broadway premiere. The musical moved to Broadway's larger [[Nederlander Theatre]] on April 29, 1996.&lt;ref name="Rent: Glory"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent | last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997| pages=54–64| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Broadway, ''Rent'' gained critical acclaim and won several awards. The Broadway production closed on September 7, 2008, after a 12-year run of 5,123 performances. On February 14, 2016, the musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' surpassed ''Rent''{{'}}s number of performances with a 2pm matinee, pushing ''Rent'' from the [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|tenth- to eleventh-longest-running Broadway show]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/WICKED-Passes-RENT-to-Become-10th-Longest-Running-Show-on-Broadway-Today-20160214]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/75222-Long-Runs-on-Broadway]&lt;/ref&gt; The production grossed over $280 million.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[[Time Magazine]], March 10, 2008 issue, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the show led to several national tours and numerous foreign productions. In 2005, it was adapted into a [[Rent (film)|motion picture]] featuring most of the original cast members.

==Concept and genesis==
In 1988, playwright [[Billy Aronson]] wanted to create "a musical based on [[Puccini]]'s ''[[La Bohème]]'', in which the luscious splendor of Puccini's world would be replaced with the coarseness and noise of modern New York."&lt;ref name="Aronson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billyaronson.com/musicals.php#rent |title=Musicals|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Jonathan Larson, a 29-year-old composer, began collaborating with Aronson on this project, and the two composed together "Santa Fe", "Splatter" (later re-worked into the song "Rent"), and "I Should Tell You". Larson suggested setting the play "amid poverty, homelessness, spunky gay life, [[Drag queen|drag queens]] and [[Punk subculture|punk]]" in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], which happened to be down the street from his [[Greenwich Village]] apartment. He also came up with the show's ultimate title (a decision that Aronson was unhappy with, at least until Larson pointed out that "rent" also means torn apart). In 1991, he asked Aronson if he could use Aronson's original concept and make ''Rent'' his own. Larson had ambitious expectations for ''Rent''; his ultimate dream was to write a rock opera "to bring musical theater to the [[MTV Generation|MTV generation]]".&lt;ref name="Odyssey"&gt;{{cite news | last=Tommasini| first=Anthony| title=The Seven-Year Odyssey That Led to ''Rent''| work=The New York Times| date=1996-03-17| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E1D91639F934A25750C0A960958260| pages=Section 2 Page 7 | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aronson and Larson made an agreement that if the show went to Broadway, Aronson would share in the proceeds and be given credit for "original concept &amp; additional lyrics".&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;

Jonathan Larson focused on composing ''Rent'' in the early 1990s, waiting tables at the [[Moondance Diner]] to support himself. Over the course of years, Larson wrote hundreds of songs and made many drastic changes to the show, which in its final incarnation contained 42 songs. In the fall of 1992, Larson approached James Nicola, artistic director of New York Theatre Workshop, with a tape and copy of ''Rent''{{'}}s script. When ''Rent'' had its first staged reading at [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in March 1993, it became evident that, despite its very promising material and moving musical numbers, many structural problems needed to be addressed, including its cumbersome length and overly complex plot.&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;

As of 1994, the New York Theatre Workshop version of ''Rent'' featured songs that never made it to the final version, such as:

* "You're a Fool"
* "Do a Little Business", the predecessor of "You'll See", featuring Benny, Mark, Roger, Collins and Angel
* "Female to Female A &amp; B", featuring Maureen and Joanne
* "He's a Fool"
* "He Says"
* "Right Brain", later rewritten as "One Song Glory", featuring Roger
* "You'll Get Over It", the predecessor of "Tango: Maureen", featuring Mark and Maureen
* "Real Estate", a number wherein Benny tries to convince Mark to become a real estate agent and drop his filmmaking
* "Open Road", the predecessor of "What You Own", with a backing track similar to this in "Your Eyes"

This workshop version of ''Rent'' starred [[Anthony Rapp]] as Mark and [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]] as Mimi. Larson continued to work on ''Rent'', gradually reworking its flaws and staging more workshop productions.&lt;ref name="Memoir"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rapp, Anthony|title=Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent|year=2006|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |ISBN=0-7432-6976-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 1996, after the musical's final dress rehearsal before its off-Broadway opening, Larson had his first (and only) newspaper interview with music critic [[Anthony Tommasini]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', attracted by the coincidence that the show was debuting exactly 100 years after Puccini's opera. Larson would not live to see ''Rent''{{'}}s success; he died from an undiagnosed [[aortic aneurysm]] (believed to have resulted from [[Marfan syndrome]]) in the early morning of January 25, 1996. Friends and family gathered at the New York Theatre Workshop, and the first preview of ''Rent'' became a sing-through of the musical in Larson's memory.&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RentEW"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Rent star tells story of show’s first preview, after Jonathan Larson died| date=April 11, 2017| url=http://ew.com/theater/2017/04/11/rent-jonathan-larson-wilson-jermaine-heredia/| pages=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show premiered as planned and quickly gained popularity fueled by enthusiastic reviews and the recent death of its composer. It proved extremely successful during its Off-Broadway run, selling out all its shows at the 150-seat New York Theater Workshop.&lt;ref name="Rent: Glory"/&gt;  Due to such overwhelming popularity and a need for a larger theater, ''Rent'' moved to Broadway's recently remodeled Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street on April 29, 1996.&lt;ref name="Rent: Glory"/&gt;

==Sources and inspiration==
Larson's inspiration for ''Rent''{{'}}s content came from several different sources. Many of the characters and plot elements are drawn directly from Giacomo Puccini's opera ''La Bohème'', the world premiere of which was in 1896, a century before ''Rent''{{'}}s premiere.&lt;ref name="Rent: Leap of Faith"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent ("Leap of Faith")| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997| pages=18–37| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Bohème'' was also about the lives of poor young artists. [[Tuberculosis]], the plague of Puccini's opera, is replaced by HIV/AIDS in ''Rent''; 1800s Paris is replaced by New York's East Village in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The names and identities of ''Rent''{{'}}s characters also heavily reflect Puccini's original characters, though they are not all direct adaptations. For example, Joanne in ''Rent'' represents the character of Alcindoro in ''Bohème'', but is also partially based on Marcello. Also, Joanne is the only ''Rent'' character whose predecessor in ''La Bohème'' is the opposite sex.

Other examples of parallels between Larson's and Puccini's work include Larson's song "Light My Candle", which draws melodic content directly from "Che gelida manina";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nisbet|first=Ian|title=Transposition in Jonathan Larson's RENT|journal=Studies in Musical Theatre|date=2012|volume=5|issue=3|page=237|doi=10.1386/smt.5.3.225_1|url=http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-Article,id=12998/|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Quando me'n vo'|Quando me'n vo]]'" ("Musetta's Waltz"), a melody taken directly from Puccini's opera; and "Goodbye Love", a long, painful piece that reflects a confrontation and parting between characters in both Puccini's and Larson's work.&lt;ref name="Libretto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impresario.ch/libretto/libpucboh_e.htm|title=La Bohème&amp;nbsp;—Libretto in English|accessdate=|publisher=Kernkonzepte: Impresario|author=Puccini, Giacomo|authorlink=Giacomo Puccini}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Quando me'n vo'" is paralleled in the first verse of "[[Take Me or Leave Me]]", when Maureen describes the way people stare when she walks in the street. It is also directly referred to in the scene where the characters are celebrating their bohemian life. Mark says, "Roger will attempt to write a bittersweet, evocative song..."  Roger plays a quick piece, and Mark adds, "...that  ''doesn't'' remind us of 'Musetta's Waltz'." This part of "Musetta's Waltz" is also later used in "Your Eyes", a song Roger writes.

''Rent'' is also a somewhat autobiographical work, as Larson incorporated many elements of his life into his show. Larson lived in New York for many years as a starving artist with an uncertain future. He sacrificed a life of stability for his art, and shared many of the same hopes and fears as his characters. Like his characters he endured poor living conditions, and some of these conditions (e.g. illegal wood-burning stove, bathtub in the middle of his kitchen, broken buzzer [his guests had to call from the pay phone across the street and he would throw down the keys, as in "Rent"]) made their way into the play.&lt;ref name="Beals"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beals, Gregory|title=The World of ''Rent''|journal=Newsweek|date=1996-05-13|volume=CXXVII|issue=20|pages=58–59}} ([http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-literary-criticism/larson-jonathan/gregory-beals-essay-date-13-may-1996 Abstract])&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the motivation behind the storyline in which Maureen leaves Mark for a woman (Joanne) is based on the fact that Larson's own girlfriend left him for a woman.  The Mark Cohen character is based on Larson's friends, cinematographer and producer Jonathan Burkhart and documentary filmmaker Eddie Rosenstein.

Playwright [[Sarah Schulman]] alleged that ''Rent'' bore striking similarities to her novel ''People in Trouble''.&lt;ref name="Schulman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2131017|accessdate=2011-03-03|title=Sarah Schulman: the writer Rent ripped off|date=November 23, 2005|first=June|last=Thomas|publisher=Slate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line, "I'm more of a man than you'll ever be... and more of a woman than you'll ever get!", attributed to Angel Dumott Schunard at her funeral, was previously used by the character Hollywood Montrose, who appeared in the films ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1987) and ''[[Mannequin Two: On the Move]]'' (1991). Like Angel, Hollywood performs a song and dance number and sometimes wears women's clothing. This line was originally in the film ''[[Car Wash (film)|Car Wash]]'' (1976), delivered by [[Antonio Fargas]] as a flamboyant homosexual cross dresser.

The earliest concepts of the characters differ largely from the finished products. Everyone except Mark had AIDS, including Maureen and Joanne; Maureen was a serious, angry character who played off [[Oedipus]] in her performance piece instead of [[Hey Diddle Diddle]]; Mark was, at one point, a painter instead of a filmmaker; Roger was named Ralph and wrote musical plays; Angel was a [[jazz]] [[philosopher]], while Collins was a street performer; Angel and Collins were both originally described as Caucasian; and Benny had a somewhat enlarged role in the story, taking part in songs like "Real Estate", which was later cut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siteforrent.com/intro.html SiteforRent.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406222216/http://www.siteforrent.com/intro.html |date=2007-04-06 }} accessed April 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WSTM Team Dustizeff 0098.jpg|thumb|Life Café]]

Many actual locations and events are included in, or are the inspiration for, elements of the musical. Life Café, where the "La Vie Bohème" numbers are set, was an actual restaurant (closed 2013) on 10th Street and Avenue B in the East Village of New York City.&lt;ref name="Life Cafe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifecafenyc.com/ls_press.shtml |title=Making Rent; A Spell for Alphabet City|accessdate=2007-01-05|publisher=Life Cafe|year=1998|author=Ben Lerman |author2=Andrew Jacobs |work=Life Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rent: Connection"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rent ("Connection")|last=Larson|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997|pages=138–141|publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The riot at the end of the first act is based on the East Village [[Tompkins Square Park riot (1988)|riot in 1988]] that arose as a result of the city-imposed curfew in [[Tompkins Square Park]].&lt;ref name="Rent: Connection" /&gt;

"Will I?", a song which takes place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with [[AIDS]], was inspired by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of [[Friends in deed|Friends in Deed]], an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much like Life Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a man stood up and said that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that there was one thing of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali and Pam, carry the names of Larson's friends who died. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) were changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who were living with or have died from AIDS.&lt;ref name="Rent: Friends In Deed"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent ("Leap of Faith: Friends in Deed")| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997| page=21| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene and song "Life Support" were also based on Friends in Deed, as well as on Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the "forget regret" refrain, and they talked about remembering love. When Jonathan's HIV positive friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: it made you angry and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this "credo...my T-cells are low, I regret that news, okay?" Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, "Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today?" Gordon admits that he is feeling the best that he has felt all year. Paul asks, "Then why choose fear?" Gordon says, "I'm a New Yorker. Fear's my life."

===Lynn Thomson lawsuit===
Lynn Thomson was a [[dramaturge|dramaturg]] who was hired by New York Theatre Workshop to help rework ''Rent''. She claimed that between early May and the end of October 1995, she and Larson co-wrote a "new version" of the musical. She sued the Larson estate for US$ 40 million and sought 16% of the show's royalties, claiming she had written a significant portion of the lyrics and the libretto of the "new version" of ''Rent''.&lt;ref name="dramaturgy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/147/f3d/195/thomson-v-s-larson|title=147 f3d 195 Thomson v. S Larson|accessdate=2014-07-07|publisher=OpenJurist.com|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[Image:Rentt.JPG|thumb|250px|right|''Rent'' at David Nederlander Theatre in Manhattan, New York City]]

===Act I===
On Christmas Eve in Manhattan's East Village, two roommates—Mark, a filmmaker, and Roger, a rock musician—struggle to stay warm and produce their art ("Tune Up #1"). Mark's mother leaves him a voicemail wishing him a merry Christmas and trying to comfort him since his ex-girlfriend Maureen dumped him ("Voice Mail #1"). Their friend Tom Collins, a gay anarchist professor at New York University, calls and plans to surprise them at their apartment, but is mugged before entering. At the same time, Mark and Roger's former roommate and friend Benny, who has since become their harsh new landlord, has reneged on an earlier agreement and now demands last year's rent, before shutting down their electrical power ("Tune Up #2"). However, Mark and Roger rebel and resolve not to pay the rent they cannot pay and which they were promised wouldn't be a problem ("Rent"). Meanwhile, Angel, a [[cross-dressing]] street drummer (presently out of drag), finds Collins wounded in an alley and tends to him ("You Okay Honey?") - the two are immediately attracted to each other, both learning that the other is [[HIV positive]]. It is revealed that Roger too has HIV which he contracted from his last girlfriend, who committed [[suicide]] after learning of her diagnosis, which has caused Roger to fall into depression. Mark goes to see one of Maureen's shows while Roger stays home ("Tune Up #3"), trying to compose on his guitar without success; he wishes desperately to write one last song to be remembered by before he dies ("One Song Glory"). An exotic dancer, junkie, and neighbor, Mimi, shows up at their apartment asking for help with lighting her candle, flirting with Roger in the process; however, he is clearly hesitant to return her affections ("Light My Candle"). Meanwhile, Joanne, a lawyer and Maureen's girlfriend, receives a voicemail from her parents ("Voice Mail #2").

At last, the missing Collins enters the apartment, presenting Angel, who is now in [[drag queen|full drag]] and shares the money she made and the amusing story of how she killed a dog to earn it ("Today 4 U"). Benny arrives, speaking of Maureen's upcoming protest against his plans to evict the [[homeless]] from a lot where he is hoping to build a cyber arts studio. Benny offers that, if they convince Maureen to cancel the protest, then Mark and Roger can officially remain rent-free tenants. However, the two rebuff Benny's offer and he leaves ("You'll See"). Mark leaves to fix Maureen's sound equipment for the protest, unexpectedly meeting Joanne at the stage. Initially hesitant with each other, the two eventually bond over their shared distrust of Maureen's promiscuous behaviors ("Tango: Maureen"). Mark joins Collins and Angel to film their HIV support group meeting ("Life Support"), while Mimi attempts to seduce Roger alone in his apartment ("Out Tonight"). Roger is extremely upset by Mimi's intrusion, demanding she leave him alone and resisting any romantic feelings he may harbor for her ("Another Day"). After Mimi leaves, Roger reflects on his fear of dying an undignified death from AIDS, while the Life Support group echoes his thoughts ("Will I").

Collins, Mark, and Angel protect a homeless woman from police harassment, but she chastises them ("On the Street"). To lighten the mood, Collins talks about his dream of escaping New York City to open a restaurant in Santa Fe ("Santa Fe"). Soon, Mark leaves to check up on Roger and while alone, Collins and Angel confess their love for each other ("I'll Cover You"). Joanne hectically prepares for Maureen's show, trying to balance all of the people calling her at once ("We're Okay"). Before the performance, Roger apologizes to Mimi, inviting her to come to the protest and the dinner party his friends are having afterwards. At the same time, police, vendors, and homeless people prepare for the protest ("Christmas Bells"). Maureen begins her avant-garde, if not over the top, performance based on "[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]" ("Over the Moon"). At the post-show party at the Life Café, Benny arrives, criticizing the protest and the group's [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle. In response, Mark and all the café's bohemian patrons defiantly rise up to celebrate their way of living ("[[La Vie Bohème]]"). Mimi and Roger each discover that the other is HIV-positive and hesitantly decide to move forward with their relationship ("I Should Tell You"). Joanne explains that Mark and Roger's building has been padlocked and a riot has broken out; Roger and Mimi, unaware, share their first kiss. The celebration continues ("La Vie Bohème B").

===Act II===
[[Image:Cast of Rent performing "Seasons of Love" at Broadway on Broadway, 2005.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Cast of ''Rent'' performing "Seasons of Love" at ''Broadway on Broadway'', 2005]]

The cast lines up to sing together before the plot of the second act begins, affirming that one should measure life "in love" ("[[Seasons of Love]]"). Afterwards, Mark and Roger gather to break back into their locked apartment with their friends ("Happy New Year"). A new voicemail reveals that Mark's footage of the riot has earned him a job offering at a [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] news company called Buzzline ("Voice Mail #3"). The others finally break through the door just as Benny arrives, saying he wants to call a truce and revealing that Mimi, a former girlfriend of his, convinced him to change his mind. Mimi denies rekindling her relationship with Benny, but Roger is upset, and although they apologize to each other, Mimi goes to her drug dealer for a fix ("Happy New Year B").

Around Valentine's Day, Mark tells the audience that Roger and Mimi have been living together, but they are tentative with each other. It is also told that Maureen and Joanne are preparing another protest, and during rehearsal, Maureen criticizes Joanne's [[controlling behavior]] and Joanne criticizes Maureen's promiscuous mannerisms. They break up dramatically following an ultimatum ("[[Take Me or Leave Me]]"). Time progresses to spring ("Seasons of Love B"), but Roger and Mimi's relationship is strained by Mimi's escalating [[heroin]] usage and Roger's lasting jealousy and suspicion of Benny. Each alone, Roger and Mimi sing of love and loneliness, telling each other how they feel, as they watch Collins nurse Angel, whose health is declining due to AIDS ("Without You"). By the end of the summer, Mark continues to receive calls offering a corporate job at Buzzline ("Voice Mail #4"). A dance is performed representing all the couples' sex lives ("Contact"). At the climax of the number, the two former couples break up, and Angel suddenly dies. At the funeral, the friends briefly come together to share their memories with Collins being the last to reminisce ("I'll Cover You [Reprise]"). Mark expresses his fear of being the only one left surviving when the rest of his friends die of AIDS, and he finally accepts the corporate job offer ("Halloween"). Roger reveals that he is leaving for Santa Fe, which sparks an argument about commitment between him and Mimi, and between Maureen and Joanne. Collins arrives and admonishes the entire group for fighting on the day of Angel's funeral, causing Maureen and Joanne to reconcile, but not Mimi and Roger. The group shares a sad moment, knowing that between deaths and leaving, their close-knit friendships will be breaking up. Everyone leaves except Mark and Roger, and so Mark tries to convince Roger to stay in New York. Roger, unable to handle Mimi's declining health, becomes angry with Mark and leaves. Mimi returns to say goodbye, overhears everything Roger says, and, terrified, agrees to go to rehab ("Goodbye Love"). Collins is forcibly removed from the church for being unable to pay for Angel's funeral; Benny shows compassion by paying and offering Mark and Collins drinks; Collins accepts, causing him and Collins to rekindle their old friendship, but Mark has to turn down the offer due to work commitments.

Some time later, both Mark and Roger simultaneously reach an artistic [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], as Roger finds his song in Mimi and Mark finds his film in Angel's memory; Roger decides to return to New York in time for Christmas, while Mark quits his job to devote his efforts to working on his own film ("What You Own"). The characters' parents, concerned and confused about their respective situations, leave several worried messages on their phones ("Voice Mail #5"). On Christmas Eve, exactly one year having passed, Mark prepares to screen his now-completed film to his friends. Roger has written his song, but no one can find Mimi for him to play it to. Benny's wife, discovering Benny's relationship with Mimi, has pulled Benny out of the East Village. The power suddenly blows and Collins enters with handfuls of cash, revealing that he reprogrammed an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] at a grocery store to provide money to anybody with the code 'ANGEL'. Maureen and Joanne abruptly enter carrying Mimi, who had been homeless and is now weak and close to death. She begins to fade, telling Roger that she loves him ("Finale"). Roger tells her to hold on as he plays her the song he wrote for her, revealing the depth of his feelings for her ("Your Eyes"). Mimi appears to die, but abruptly awakens, claiming to have been heading into a [[near-death experience|white light]] before a vision of Angel appeared, telling her to go back and stay with Roger. The remaining friends gather together in a final moment of shared happiness and resolve to enjoy whatever time they have left with each other, affirming that there is "no day but today" ("[[Finale B]]").&lt;ref name="Rent: No Day but Today"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent (''no day but today'')| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997| pages=188–189| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Roger Davis''' (Lead): A once-successful-but-now-struggling musician and ex-lead singer and rock guitarist who is HIV-positive and an ex-junkie. He hopes to write one last meaningful song before he dies.  He is having a hard time coping with the fact that he, along with many others around him, knows that he is going to die. His girlfriend, April, killed herself after finding out that she was HIV-positive. He is roommates with Mark.

== Reception ==
''Rent'' received several awards including a [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]] and four [[Tony Award|Tony Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/theater-arts/cast-rent-article-1.2478997|title=Where the cast of "Rent" is now|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical reception of ''Rent'' was positive not only for its acting and musical components, but for its representation of HIV-positive individuals. Many critics praised the portrayal of characters such as Angel and Collins as being happy, with positive outlooks on life, rather than being resigned to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/rkee5nh4_woa/no-day-but-today-the-critical-reception-of-rent/|title=No Day But Today: The Critical Reception of RENT|website=prezi.com|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; While critics and theatre patrons had largely positive reviews of the show, criticism was given to the show for the stereotypically negative portrayal of lesbian characters and the "glamourization" of the East Village in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121331730861070229|title=Among the 'Rentheads'|last=Hymowitz|first=Kay S.|date=2008-06-13|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billy Aronson said, "For the record, although I was ambivalent about Jonathan’s ideas for ''Rent'' when we were working together on it, I have come to love the show. And as tragic as it is that he didn’t live to see his work become a huge success, I believe he knew it would be. In our last conversation I asked how the show was going and he said, with complete assurance, that it was incredible."&lt;ref name="Aronson"/&gt;

==Cultural impact and legacy==
The song "Seasons of Love" became a successful pop song and often is performed on its own. Because of its connection to [[New Years]] and looking back at times past, it is sometimes performed at graduations or school holiday programs.

===RENT-heads===
''Rent'' gathered a following of fans who refer to themselves as "RENT-heads."  The name originally referred to people who would camp out at the Nederlander Theater for hours in advance for the discounted $20 rush tickets to each show, though it generally refers to anyone who is obsessed with the show.&lt;ref name="Time for 'Rent'"&gt;Adams, Bob.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20021024083952/http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/Village/1432/phillynews8.html "Time for 'Rent'",] ''The Philadelphia Gay News'', August 14, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  These discounted tickets were for seats in the first two rows of the theater reserved for sale by lottery two hours prior to each show.&lt;ref name="Time for 'Rent'"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reidel Party"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Riedel, Michael|title=Every Day a 'Rent' Party: hardcore fans of the hit musical form a squatters camp at the box office|date=1997-03-03|page=27|location=New York |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Broadway shows have followed ''Rent''{{'}}s example and now also offer cheaper tickets in efforts to make Broadway theater accessible to people who would otherwise be unable to afford the ticket prices.

The term originated in ''Rent''{{'}}s first months on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. The show's producers offered 34 seats in the front two rows of the orchestra for $20 each, two hours before the performance. Fans and others interested in tickets would camp out for hours in front of the [[Nederlander Theater]] – which is on 41st Street, just outside [[Times Square]] – to buy these tickets.&lt;ref name="Reidel Party"/&gt;

==Productions==

===New York workshops and off-Broadway production===
''Rent'' had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993.&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;  A further two-week [[New York Theatre Workshop]] version was performed in 1994 starring Anthony Rapp as Mark and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi, and more workshops followed. The show opened on 1996, again at New York Theatre Workshop, and quickly gained popularity off-Broadway, receiving enthusiastic reviews.  ''The New York Times'' theater critic [[Ben Brantley]] called it an "exhilarating, landmark rock opera" with a "glittering, inventive score" that "shimmers with hope for the future of the American musical."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E7DC1239F937A25751C0A960958260 "Rock Opera A la 'Boheme' And 'Hair'",] ''The New York Times'', February 14, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  Another reviewer wrote, "''Rent'' speaks to [[Generation X]] the way that the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' spoke to the [[baby boomers]] or those who grew up in the 1960s," while the ''New York Times'' similarly called it "a rock opera for our time, a ''Hair'' for the 90s."&lt;ref name="Comet"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Birth of a Theatrical Comet|journal=The New York Times|date=1996-03-17|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B10F83D5D0C748DDDAA0894DE494D81|pages=Section 2 page 1|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show proved extremely successful off-Broadway, selling out all of its performances at the 150-seat theatre.&lt;ref name="Rent: Glory"/&gt;

===Original Broadway production===
Due to its overwhelming popularity and the need for a larger theater, ''Rent'' moved to Broadway's previously derelict Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street on April 29, 1996.&lt;ref name="Rent: Glory"/&gt;  On Broadway, the show achieved critical acclaim and word-of-mouth popularity. The production's ethnically diverse principal cast originally included [[Taye Diggs]], [[Wilson Jermaine Heredia]], [[Jesse L. Martin]], [[Idina Menzel]], [[Adam Pascal]], [[Anthony Rapp]], [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]] and [[Fredi Walker]].

The production's controversial topics and innovative pricing, including same day-of-performance $20 tickets, helped to increase the popularity of musical theater amongst the younger generation.&lt;ref name="Marks"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Marks, Peter| title=Looking on Broadway For Ramshackle Home| journal=The New York Times| date=February 26, 1996| page=C9| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20616FD3A5D0C758EDDAB0894DE494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fN%2fNew%20York%20Theater%20Workshop| access-date=February 12, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529083704/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20616FD3A5D0C758EDDAB0894DE494D81&amp;n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FOrganizations%2FN%2FNew%20York%20Theater%20Workshop| archive-date=May 29, 2007| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The production was nominated for ten [[Tony Awards]] in 1996 and won four: Best Musical, Best Book, Best Original Score and Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical (Heredia)&lt;ref name="Tonys Search"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/p/tonys_search?year=1996&amp;show=Rent|title=Past Winners Search|accessdate=November 30, 2006 |publisher=IBM Corp., Tony Award Productions|work=The Official Website of the American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 24, 2006, the original Broadway cast reunited for a one-night performance of the musical at the Nederlander Theatre. This performance raised over $2,000,000 for the [[Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation]], [[Friends In Deed]] and New York Theatre Workshop. Former cast members were invited, and many from prior tours and former Broadway casts appeared, performing an alternate version of "Seasons of Love" as the finale of the performance.&lt;ref name="Playbill 10th"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98789.html|title=''Rent''{{'}}s 10th Anniversary Celebration Will Reunite Past Bohemians, for Three Good Causes|publisher=Playbill, Inc.|date=2006-03-30|author=Jones, Kenneth|accessdate=November 30, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061224123746/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98789.html|archivedate=December 24, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Original cast [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] members Rodney Hicks and Gwen Stewart returned to the cast at the time of the Broadway closing. Hicks played Benny and Stewart played the role she created, the soloist in the song "Seasons of Love". In addition, actress [[Tracie Thoms]] joined the cast at the end of the run playing Joanne, the role she portrayed in the 2005 film version.&lt;ref name="AP0907" /&gt;  The last Broadway performance was filmed and screened in movie theaters as ''Rent: Filmed Live on Broadway'' in September 2008. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray formats on February 3, 2009.

===North American touring productions===
Successful United States national tours, the "Angel Tour" and the "Benny Tour", launched in the 1990s. Later, the non-[[Actors' Equity|Equity]] tour started its run. There was also a Canadian tour (often referred to as the "Collins Tour").

The Angel tour began in November 1996 in Boston. Anthony Rapp joined the cast for the Chicago run, and Daphne Rubin-Vega joined for the Los Angeles run. The tour finished in San Francisco in September 1999. Other members of the Angel Cast included [[Carrie Hamilton]], [[Amy Spanger]], [[Luther Creek]], [[Kristoffer Cusick]], [[Tony Vincent]].

The Benny Tour began in July 1997 in San Diego, CA at the LaJolla Playhouse. Michael Grief, the original director of the Broadway show was also the artistic director of the LaJolla Playhouse and was instrumental in arranging for the Benny tour to begin in the smaller city of San Diego rather than Los Angeles, CA. It originally featured [[Neil Patrick Harris]] in the role of Mark Cohen. The Benny tour generally played shorter stops and often-smaller markets than the Angel Tour did. Other cast members included [[Wilson Cruz]] and [[d'Monroe]].

Tours ran each season from 2005 to 2008. Cast members throughout the run included [[Aaron Tveit]], [[Ava Gaudet]], [[Declan Bennett]], [[Rebecca Naomi Jones]], [[Constantine Maroulis]], [[Dan Rosenbaum]], [[Heinz Winckler]], [[Anwar Robinson]] and [[Karen Olivo]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} In 2009, a national tour starring Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp, reprising their original Broadway roles, launched in Cleveland, OH. Original Broadway Cast member Gwen Steward also appeared, alongside [[Michael McElroy (actor)|Michael McElroy]] as Collins, The tour ended on February 7, 2010, in Sacramento, CA.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/136616-Cest-La-Vie-Rent-Tour-With-Pascal-Rapp-and-Stewart-Shutters-Feb-7 "C'est La Vie: Rent Tour, With Pascal, Rapp and Stewart, Shutters Feb. 7"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211142443/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/136616-Cest-La-Vie-Rent-Tour-With-Pascal-Rapp-and-Stewart-Shutters-Feb-7 |date=2010-02-11 }}, playbill.com, February 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;   A 20th Anniversary touring production of ''Rent'' began in Dallas on September 20, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/dates-and-cities-announced-for-rent-39-s-20th-anniversary-tour|title=Dates and Cities Announced for Rent's 20th Anniversary Tour. {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|language=en|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK productions===
The show made its UK premiere on April 21, 1998, at the West End's [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] and officially opened on May 12, 1998. The original cast included Krysten Cummings as Mimi Marquez, Wilson Jermaine Heredia as Angel Schunard, Bonny Lockhart as Benjamin Coffin III, Jesse L. Martin as Tom Collins, Adam Pascal as Roger Davis, Anthony Rapp as Mark Cohen, and Jessica Tezier as Maureen Johnson. The show closed on October 30, 1999, after one-and-a-half years. Limited revivals took place at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]] from December 4, 2001, to January 6, 2002; December 6, 2002, to March 1, 2003 (featuring [[Adam Rickett]] as Mark and [[Caprice Bourret|Caprice]] as Maureen).  There was also a successful production for a limited run in Manchester in 2006 with an additional 'goodbye' performance in 2008 from the Manchester cast.

On October 16, 2007, the heavily revised production titled ''Rent Remixed'' opened at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in London's West End. Directed by [[William Baker (fashion designer)|William Baker]], it was set in the present day. The cast included [[Oliver Thornton]] (Mark), [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]] (Roger), Craig Stein (Benny), [[Leon Lopez]] (Collins), [[Francesca Jackson]] (Joanne), Jay Webb (Angel), [[Siobhán Donaghy]] (Mimi), and [[Denise Van Outen]] (Maureen). From December 24, 2007, the role of Maureen was played by [[Jessie Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Theatre-Review/rent-jessie-wallace-joins-cast Jessie Wallace joins cast of ''RENT''] – IndieLondon, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The production received generally unfavorable reviews. The Guardian gave it only one out of five stars, writing, "They call this 'Rent Remixed'. I'd dub it 'Rent Reduced', in that the late Jonathan Larson's reworking of La Bohème, while never a great musical, has been turned into a grisly, synthetic, pseudo pop concert with no particular roots or identity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/theatre/drama/reviews/story/0,,2192137,00.html Rent | Theatre story|Guardian Unlimited Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;  The production closed on February 2, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113661.html|title=New  London Production of Rent to Close in February 2008|work=Playbill|accessdate=23 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229072708/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113661.html|archivedate=29 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production radically altered elements of the musical including defining the characters of Mimi, Angel and Mark as British. Songs were reordered (including Maureen's first appearance as the Act I finale).  The rehaul of the score was masterminded by [[Steve Anderson (musician)|Steve Anderson]] and featured radically rearranged versions of Out Tonight, Today 4 U, Over the Moon and Happy New Year.

A one-off Rent - The 20th Anniversary Concert was held at the Blackpool Opera house   Monday November 11, 2013 
A 20th anniversary tour opened at [[Theatr Clwyd]] in October 2016 before playing a two-month run at the [[St James Theatre, London]].

===Off-Broadway revival===
The show was revived [[Off-Broadway]] at Stage 1 of [[New World Stages]] with previews starting July 14, 2011 and a scheduled opening of August 11, 2011. This was the first New York Revival of the show since the original production closed less than three years earlier. The production was directed by ''Rent'''s original director [[Michael Greif]].  Almost the entire show was different from the original yet the reinvention did not please the critics, who complained that the new actors did not have a feel for the characters they were playing and it made the show feel contrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/theater/reviews/rent-revival-at-new-world-stages-review.html?scp=1&amp;sq=rent&amp;st=cse |work=The New York Times|first=Ben|last=Brantley|title=‘Rent' Revival at New World Stages – Review|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Off-Broadway production of RENT closed on September 9, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/169812-Off-Broadways-Rent-Closes-Sept-9 |title=Off-Broadway's Rent Closes Sept. 9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913000902/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/169812-Off-Broadways-Rent-Closes-Sept-9 |archivedate=2012-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
{{Main article|Rent (film)}}

In 2005, ''Rent'' was adapted into a movie directed by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] with a screenplay by [[Stephen Chbosky]]. With the exception of Daphne Rubin-Vega (who was pregnant at the time of filming) and Fredi Walker (who felt she was too old for her role), who played Mimi and Joanne respectively in the original Broadway cast, the original Broadway cast members reprised the principal roles. Released on November 23, 2005, the film remained in the box office top ten for three weeks, receiving mixed reviews. Several plot elements were changed slightly, and some songs were changed to spoken dialogue or cut entirely for the film. The soundtrack was produced by [[Rob Cavallo]], engineered by Doug McKean and features renowned session musicians [[Jamie Muhoberac]], [[Tim Pierce]] and [[Dorian Crozier]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45196">[[File:Anita Sarkeesian 2013.jpg|thumb|Media critic [[Anita Sarkeesian]] drew attention to sexism in video gaming with her video series ''[[Tropes vs. Women in Video Games]]'']]

'''Sexism in video gaming''' is prejudiced behavior or [[discrimination]] based on [[sex]] or [[gender]] as experienced by people who play and create [[video game]]s, primarily women. This may manifest as [[sexual harassment]] or in the way [[Gender representation in video games|genders are represented in games]], such as when characters are presented according to gender-related tropes and stereotypes.

The demographics of [[video game culture]] have changed since the 1980s and 90s, when video games were perceived as something of interest mainly to young men. Women make up about half of all game players as of the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2014 Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry|date=April 2014|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]|page=3|url=http://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ESA_EF_2014.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change, as well as publicized incidents of harassment such as the [[Gamergate controversy]] in 2014, have contributed to industry professionals and media increasingly paying attention to issues related to sexism in video gaming.

==Harassment==

=== Form ===
Harassment can involve sexist insults or comments, death or rape threats, demanding sexual favors in exchange for virtual or real money, or criticism of the presence of women and their interests.&lt;ref name= BBC&gt;{{cite web|last=Fletcher|first=James|title=Sexual harassment in the world of video gaming|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18280000|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, female players are also [[stalking|stalked]], whether online or offline.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

Women are sometimes marginalized as "intruders", as it is assumed they do not play video games that aren't associated with female players such as [[the Sims]], [[music video game]]s or [[casual games]]. Conversely, insults towards men focus mainly on their alleged lack of manliness for playing "girl games" or disliking violent games.&lt;ref name="pricec"&gt;{{cite web|author=Emily Matthew|title=Sexism in Video Games: There Is Sexism in Gaming|url=http://blog.pricecharting.com/2012/09/emilyami-sexism-in-video-games-study.html|publisher=Price Charting|date=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, women may face offensive behavior at conventions, competitions or in video games stores. It may affect female gamers, journalists or [[video game developer|game developers]], even when they are invited to talk at a conference or to present a game.&lt;ref name="szfrauen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/frauenrollen-in-computerspielen-sexspielzeug-1.1554509|title=Frauenrollen in Computerspielen – Sexspielzeug – Digital – Süddeutsche.de|work=Süddeutsche.de|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/sexismus-in-videospielen-wo-feminismus-als-terrorismus-gilt-1.1389210|title=Sexismus in Videospielen – Wo Feminismus als "Terrorismus" gilt – Digital – Süddeutsche.de|work=Süddeutsche.de|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="inrocks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesinrocks.com/2013/03/19/actualite/le-milieu-geek-bien-trop-sexiste-11375418/|title=Les Inrocks – Le milieu geek, bien trop sexiste ?|work=Les Inrocks|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the release of the [[NES]], video games advertisements have been accused of strengthening this tendency by targeting only men.&lt;ref name="no girls" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huma"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanite.fr/medias/jeux-video-et-machisme-c-est-loin-d-etre-fini-554125|title=Playstation 4 (PS4) et Xbox One: la surenchère sexiste – L'Humanité|work=L'Humanité|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, women stopped being represented playing video games in advertisement and scantily clad women started being used on game covers and ads.&lt;ref name="no girls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed|title=No girls allowed – Polygon|work=Polygon|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women saw their non-sexualized female character designs rejected, and others reported [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace.&lt;ref name="guard twit"&gt;{{cite web|title=#1reasonwhy: the hashtag that exposed games industry sexism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/nov/28/games-industry-sexism-on-twitter|author=Mary Hamilton|date=November 28, 2012|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|title=#1ReasonWhy: Women Take to Twitter to Talk about Sexism in Video Game Industry|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/27/1reasonwhy-women-take-to-twitter-to-talk-about-sexism-in-video-game-industry|date=November 27, 2012|publisher=[[Time Magazine|Time]] Newsfeed|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2014 survey created by the International Videogame Developers Association about the satisfaction of working in video game development, results show that females claimed insubordination from subordinate male colleagues, a preference for white males in management position, and a preference for males in hiring and promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Kate|last2=Weststar|first2=Johanna|last3=Meloni|first3=Wanda|last4=Pearce|first4=Celia|last5=Legault|first5=Marie-Josée|title=Developer Satisfaction Survey 2014 Summer Report|url=http://gameqol.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IGDA%20DSS%202014-Summary%20Report_released.pdf|website=gameqol.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211032252/http://gameqol.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IGDA%20DSS%202014-Summary%20Report_released.pdf|archivedate=December 11, 2014|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Women remain outsiders in video game industry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burrows|first1=Leah|title=Women remain outsiders in video game industry|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/01/27/women-remain-outsiders-video-game-industry/275JKqy3rFylT7TxgPmO3K/story.html|website=Boston Globe|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same survey, many female developers complained about how peers did not take their video game credentials into serious consideration and reported invitations to "meetings" that were actually romantic dates.

Sexual harassment occurs frequently in many online settings relating online video games. Specifically, 65% of women report harassment and statistically receive three times as much derogatory or insulting remarks than men. With anonymity masking gamers, women are susceptible to extreme misogynistic and violent remarks.&lt;ref&gt;Digitized Lives, T.V. Reed&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games conferences have been criticised for using sexualised advertising such as '[[Promotional model|booth babes]]', creating a demeaning image of women, and for failing to stop harassment of female attendees. This has led some to adopt or share codes of conduct for managing these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/forum/thread/242422 |title=Booth Babes and the Expo |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|last=Silverstein |first=Jonathan |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=1558683 |title=Sexy 'Booth Babes' Under Siege – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2006-02-02 |accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Penny Arcade"&gt;{{cite web|title=PAX Code of Conduct|url=http://east.paxsite.com/safety-and-security|website=Penny Arcade|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duhaime |first=Arielle |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/10/5294440/why-cant-ces-quit-booth-babes |title=Why can't CES quit booth babes? |publisher=The Verge |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelion |first=Leo |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-21373094 |title=BBC News – CES 'booth babe' guidelines revised but ban rejected |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2013-02-10 |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frequency ===
Insults are frequent in [[Online game|online gaming]]. However, according to Stephen Toulouse (moderator of the online gaming service [[Xbox Live]]), between 2007 and 2012 women were the most frequent target of harassment.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Leary|first=Amy|title=In Virtual Play, Sex Harassment Is All Too Real|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/us/sexual-harassment-in-online-gaming-stirs-anger.html|accessdate=12 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, data from [[Riot Games]] lists racism and homophobia at the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using science to reform toxic player behavior in League of Legends|author=Dennis Scimeca|date=May 16, 2013|work=Ars Technica|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/05/using-science-to-reform-toxic-player-behavior-in-league-of-legends/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, derogatory words for homosexuality are used almost constantly in online gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/01/13/homophobia-and-harassment-in-the-online-gaming-age|author=Nathan Meunier|date=January 13, 2010|title=Homophobia and harassment in the online gaming age|work=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a study of the Ohio University showed that the same person playing [[Halo 3]] online with a male and a female profile using recorded voice messages received three times more negative comments with the female profile, despite similar game scores. Even welcoming everybody at the beginning of a game could lead to sexist insults against the female profile.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.fr/culture/74637/jeux-video-etude-sexisme-joueurs|title=Jeux vidéo: une étude confirme le sexisme des joueurs – Slate.fr|work=Slate.fr|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pacific"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/halo-3-gamers-are-often-sexist-too-61564|title=Study: Female Gamers Receive Verbal Abuse From Male Gamers – Pacific Standard: The Science of Society|work=Pacific Standard|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study of Halo 3 player interactions found that less skilled male players display a tendency to make frequent, nasty comments to female gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dewey|first1=Caitlin|title=Men who harass women online are quite literally losers, new study finds|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/07/20/men-who-harass-women-online-are-quite-literally-losers-new-study-finds/|work=Washington Post|date=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers suggested that the poorly performing males "attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kasumovic|first1=Michael M.|last2=Kuznekoff|first2=Jeffrey H.|last3=Ponti|first3=Giovanni|title=Insights into Sexism: Male Status and Performance Moderates Female-Directed Hostile and Amicable Behaviour|journal=PLOS ONE|date=15 July 2015|volume=10|issue=7|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0131613|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131613|pages=e0131613|pmid=26176699|pmc=4503401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from 2006 showed that 83.4% of gamers had seen the words "gay" or "queer" used as derogatory names, and that 52.7% of gay gamers perceived the gaming community as "somewhat hostile" while 14% perceived it as "very hostile".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Gay-rights-group-plans-talk-on-silencing-slurs-by-3224946.php|title=Gay rights group plans talk on silencing slurs by online gamers|date=July 16, 2009|author=Kim, Ryan|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lucy Waterlow, there appears to be a deep history of sexual harassment in the video game industry and women who play video games on online forums such as Call of Duty are often told they should "return to the kitchen", along with other slurs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waterlow|first1=Lucy|title='Rape and death threats are common': Women gamers reveal the vile online abuse they receive EVERY DAY from men who say they should 'get back in the kitchen'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3454588/Women-gamers-reveal-vile-online-abuse-receive-DAY-men-say-kitchen.html|publisher=DailyMail|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the changing demographics that have been seen in the video game community (an increasing proportion of people who play video games are, as it appears, female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distribution of computer and video gamers in the United States from 2006 to 2017, by gender|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/232383/gender-split-of-us-computer-and-video-gamers/|website=Statista|publisher=Electronic Software Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;), have led to certain consequences. The largest change in terms of who plays video games has been that of gender proportions. This translates to more women playing video games than ever before, “almost reaching parity” with the number of men that play video games. The most visible and immediate ramifications of that have been the resistance of men and even some women within the industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsanz.org.nz/journal/docs/WSJNZ291Todd64-67.pdf|last1=Todd|first1=Cherie|website=WSJNA291Todd|publisher=WSANZ|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have stated that there is an increasing pervasiveness of the sexual harassment of women in the video game community. A study conducted by Kate O'Halloran in 2017 found that women receive an almost amplified amount of harassment in the setting of online video games than they do in real life, whereas preferential treatment is given to men by other men. The difference in the treatment of women further diminishes the desire of women to participate in video games, or, as O'Halloran found, to completely conceal their gender identity and allow other players to assume their gender. Liliana Braumberger, a participant in O'Halloran's study, states that this stems from the fact that the men who engage in this form of sexual harassment have the invisibility and anonymity that comes with participating in an online server, and that men have a certain sense of entitlement that leads to the invisibility of women. She feels that this discrimination and erasure potentially have the same effects on other people who do not identify as men, not necessarily just women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Halloran|first1=Kate|title=‘Hey dude, do this’: the last resort for female gamers escaping online abuse|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/24/hey-dude-do-this-the-last-resort-for-female-gamers-escaping-online-abuse|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Another Latina, female player answered  the interview. She said that during online games, men would send her pictures of things she didn't want to see, or they would harass her. Moreover, one of her experiences is that the other players would say she was a guy playing under a girl's name just because she played well in the game. She was hesitant to jump into multiplayer and practiced by herself before going online. And once she was online, she would generally have a good time and dominate the public leaderboards, but the gamer is almost universally assumed to be a 'he,' People would complement her like, 'hey well done bro, hey dude, do this.' she said that they are just using male language to address her. She has never bothered to correct it because when she did, it would spark a whole unwanted conversation.

One man continued to "stalk" her avatar in the game. Then came the question such as "what are you wearing?""have you got any pics?" "hove you got any NODE pics?" "Do you fuck guys who like games?"

== Effects ==

A study performed by Jesse Fox et al. suggested that due the [[Proteus effect]], manifesting a sexualized character in a video game can have adverse mental effects. They designed a study in which 86 women from West Coast university played a [[virtual reality]] game. Women who used sexualized characters that looked like them had a higher [[rape myth]] acceptance than those in other conditions, which is the validation of incorrect and stereotypical ideas about rape that [[blame the victim]], and increased body-related thinking which can lead to increased [[self-objectification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=Jesse|title=The embodiment of sexualized virtual selves: The Proteus effect and experiences of self-objectification via avatars.|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=2013|volume=29|pages=930–938|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.12.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; When players immerse themselves into the games they are playing, it allows them to watch their behaviors from an external viewpoint. For some, they become more pleased with their avatar in the video game and it makes them feel good because they get to be the person they want to be. They lose sight of their physical self and match their modified self in the game. Yee and Bailenson found, in a study, that when the players manifest an attractive character, they are more open to talking to another character and will open up more. When women, especially, take over more sexualized characters, they begin to center on the more physical and sexual features, and their opinion start to support the materialization and sexualization of women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=f2e07096-3845-4e7d-9513-0e443ffe3778@sdc-v-sessmgr01&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=S074756321200369X&amp;db=edselp|title=The embodiment of sexualized virtual selves: The Proteus effect and experie...: Discovery Service for Loyola Marymount Univ|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Fredrickson and Roberts created the idea of objectification theory, stating that it was an environment when cultures press both girls and women to socialize in a way that they will begin to form ideas that they should be looked at as objects. It takes away their self worth and causes them to think they are only in their society to be looked at for their bodies, with a purely sexual use. Women begin to hold onto this perspective and believe that their appearance is most important and how they are valued. Combined with the Proteus effect, it is expected that a woman who chooses a more sexualized avatar will objectify themselves more than one who chooses a non-sexualized avatar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In another study, 181 students from a private [[liberal arts]] college in North Carolina were tested. The group exposed to highly sexualized images, from video games (in comparison to [[control group]]), was more tolerant to sexual harassment but showed the same rape myth acceptance.&lt;ref name="DillBrown2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dill|first1=Karen E.|last2=Brown|first2=Brian P.|last3=Collins|first3=Michael A.|title=Effects of exposure to sex-stereotyped video game characters on tolerance of sexual harassment|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=44|issue=5|year=2008|pages=1402–1408|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar study was done in France, studying young adults being exposed to sexist materials in video games. The sample filled out a survey, which compared how much time they spent playing video games and their attitudes towards women. The results showed that when narrowed down to gender and socioeconomic levels, a connection was made between stronger sexist views and a higher amount of time spent playing video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bègue|first=Laurent|last2=Sarda|first2=Elisa|last3=Gentile|first3=Douglas A.|last4=Bry|first4=Clementine|last5=Roché|first5=Sebastian|date=2017-03-31|title=Video Games Exposure and Sexism in a Representative Sample of Adolescents|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5374198/|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=8|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00466|issn=1664-1078|pmc=5374198|pmid=28408891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karen E. Dill and Kathryn P. Thill state that adolescents, particularly boys and those who play games, are ignorant of the adverse impacts of detestable media content, and therefore ignorant of the when they are affected adversely.  Theories such as the [[cultivation theory]], [[social cognitive theory]], ambivalent sexism theory, and hegemonic masculinity theory all aid Dill and Thill in discussing the repercussions of perpetuating gender stereotypes in media like video games. Cultivation theory is key to the analysis of sexism in video games, because it is the idea that when an individual is exposed long-term to multimedia, their understanding of their reality can change into becoming more similar to the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breuer|first=Johannes|last2=Kowert|first2=Rachel|last3=Festl|first3=Ruth|last4=Quandt|first4=Thorsten|date=April 2015|title=Sexist Games=Sexist Gamers?

They write that "Gender portrayals of video game characters reinforce a sexist, patriarchal view that men are aggressive and powerful and that women are not healthy, whole persons, but sex objects, eye candy and generally second-class citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dill|first1=Karen E.|title=Video Game Characters and the Socialization of Gender Roles:  Young People's Perceptions Mirror Sexist Media Depictions.|journal=Sex Roles|date=2007|volume=57|pages=851–864|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9278-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jeffrey Kuznekoff and Lindsey Rose, the fact that gamers experience misconstrued portrayals of appearance, violence, and sexual objectification can impact their understanding and communication with other gamers, especially female gamers. In addition, these gender portrayals become increasingly prominent because of the mass appeal and number of users of online multiplayer games. They found that the female voice received nearly three times as many directed negative comments than the male voice or control. They also found that there was no correlation between the number of directed negative comments and the skill level of the other player.  On several occasions, the female voice received strong sexist replies for phrases such as "hi everybody" or "alright team let's do this" despite the female voice having almost the same win percentage as the male voice (56% to 61%, respectively). Additionally, they found that when the other player responded with a positive remark, they were more likely to ask questions. Overall, Kuznekoff and Rose found that there were hypernegative effects with hostile targeting of the female voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuznekoff|first1=Jeffrey H.|title=Communication in multiplayer gaming: Examining player responses to gender cues|journal=New Media &amp; Society|date=2012|volume=15|issue=|pages=541–556|doi=10.1177/1461444812458271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a three-year German study of 824 gamers found, when controlling for age and education, that there was no correlation between sexist attitudes and time spent playing video games, or with preference for video game genres.

The study contends that "perceived gender-based performance disparities seem to result from factors that are confounded with gender (i.e., amount of play), not player gender itself".&lt;ref name="ShenRatanCaiLeavitt"/&gt; Lead author Cuihai Shen stated that if there was a gender disparity favoring men then "they should advance to higher levels within the same amount of play time" however their analysis indicated "women advanced at least as fast as men did in both games".&lt;ref name="ShenRatanConversation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shen|first1=Cuihua|last2=Ratan|first2=Rabindra|title=Gender has no role in ability, girls just spend less time playing, says study|url=https://theconversation.com/debunking-one-of-the-biggest-stereotypes-about-women-in-the-gaming-community-60033|website=theconversation.com/|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shen outlined that there was a difference in play style between the genders, and stated "women did spend less time playing overall than men, they chose characters that are more assistive, and were more drawn to social interaction and helping others.&lt;ref name="ShenRatanConversation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shen|first1=Cuihua|title=Gender has no role in ability, girls just spend less time playing, says study|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3680741/Are-men-really-better-video-games-Study-says-gender-no-role-performance-women-just-spend-time-playing.html|website=Daily Mail|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was conducted on 154 Italian male high school volunteers. They were tasked with playing one of three different types of games. The first was ''Grand Theft Auto''. Females in this game are secondary, usually strippers and prostitutes that are used as sexual objects by players. The second was ''Half Life 1'' and ''Half Life 2''. Although this game is violent, the female character plays a lead role and is not depicted in a sexist or sexual manner. Lastly, there was ''Dream Pinball 3D'' and ''Q.U.B.E. 2'', which contain no violence or sexuality. Afterward, the volunteers were shown one of two pictures that showed females as victims of violence. Participants then rated whether they felt sympathetic, moved, compassionate, tender, warm, softhearted, disregarded or indifferent on a scale of 1, ''not at all'' to 7, ''very much''. The study concluded that those that identified strongly with the male characters in the sexist-violent video game, ''Grand Theft Auto'', showed the least amount of empathy towards the female violence victims. "The portrayal of men in the media as socially powerful and physically violent reinforces assumptions about how men and boys should act in society, as well as how they should treat women and girls. Exposure to sex-typed media characters can have real world consequence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gabbiadini|first=Alessandro |last2=Riva | first2=Paolo | first3=Luca | last3=Andrighetto | first4=Chiara | last4=Volpato | first5=Brad J. | last5=Bushman|date=13 April 2016|title=Acting like a Tough Guy: Violent-Sexist Video Games, Identification with Game Characters, Masculine Beliefs, &amp; Empathy for Female Violence Victims|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152121|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|pages=1–14|via=|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0152121 | pmid=27074057 | pmc=4830454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Countermeasures ==
Female activists actively promote changes in the way women are portrayed in games and how they are treated by the industry and gaming public as a whole. Media critic [[Anita Sarkeesian]], for example, has – through her organization [[Feminist Frequency]] – given lectures and training to help change gaming culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/how-anita-sarkeesian-wants-video-games-to-change-1688231729|title=How Anita Sarkeesian Wants Video Games To Change|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|work=Kotaku|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A prevailing perception is that the gaming industry is not fit for female workers because of sexism. According to Richard Wilson, CEO of [[The Independent Game Developers' Association|TIGA]], "typically, 80% of the workforce is qualified to degree level or above, but the proportion of women studying subjects such as computer science or games programming courses is low. There is only a comparatively small pool of potential female employees available to work in the games industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/15/video-game-industry-diversity-problem-women-non-white-people|title=The video game industry has a diversity problem – but it can be fixed|last=Ramanan|first=Chella|date=2017-03-15|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiatives on the part of gaming companies include codes of conduct and the adoption of trainings and standards to ensure safe and respectful workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeswomanfiles/2013/01/18/women-and-video-gamings-dirty-little-secrets/#4ec6cbe42e8c|title=Women And Video Gaming's Dirty Little Secrets|last=Files|first=The ForbesWoman|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to combat sexism, the French government in 2016 proposed pieces of legislation that would give bonuses or incentives to video game creators that promote a more positive image of female characters in their games.  Furthermore, these proposals outline a rating system that distinguishes games that promote a positive female representation and those that do not, with the latter getting the highest age 18 rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/16569-france-is-reviewing-ways-to-combat-sexism-in-video-games|title=France is Reviewing Ways to Combat Sexism in Video Games|last=Kim|first=Matt|date=June 5, 2016|website=Inverse.com|publisher=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/4/11857930/france-sexism-video-games-label-women|title=France Considers Cracking Down on Sexism in Video Games|last=Toor|first=Amar|date=June 4, 2016|website=Theverge.com|publisher=|access-date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sha-Amun-en-su''' ({{lang-egy|the fertile fields of Amun}}) was an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] priestess and singer who lived in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] during the first half of the [[8th century BC|8th century B.C.]], responsible for ceremonial duties at the [[Karnak|Temple of Karnak]], dedicated to the god [[Amun]]. Sha-Amun-en-su was a ''Heset'', i.e., a member of the foremost group of singers with ritualistic functions active in the temple of Amun. After her death, which is estimated to have occurred around the age of 50, the singer was [[Mummy|mummified]] and placed in a [[sarcophagus]] made of [[stucco]] and [[polychrome]] wood. Since its sealing, more than 2700 years ago, Sha-Amun-en-su's sarcophagus had never been opened, throughout its history, conserving inside the singer's mummy, a feature that gave it extreme rarity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/2014/01/13/o-ultimo-ato-da-favorita-imperador/|title=O último ato da favorita do imperador : Revista Pesquisa Fapesp|website=revistapesquisa.fapesp.br|language=pt-br|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sarcophagus and its mummy were given as presents to the Brazilian emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Dom Pedro II]] during his second travel to Egypt, in 1876, by the [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail Pasha]]. They became featured items displayed in the [[Quinta da Boa Vista|Palace of São Cristóvão]], integrating Pedro II's private collection until the [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|Proclamation of the Republic]], in 1889, when they became part of the  Egyptian collection of the [[National Museum of Brazil|National Museum]] of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. However, a [[National Museum of Brazil fire|large-scale fire in the museum]] on 2 September 2018, destroyed the sarcophagus and the mummy, as well as almost all archaeological artifacts in permanent display.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-45391771|title=O que havia no acervo do Museu Nacional e foi consumido pelo fogo|date=2018-09-02|work=BBC News Brasil|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
[[File:Sha-Amun-en-su_(hieróglifos).jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|Hieroglyphic inscription of Sha-Amun-en-su name and title on the sarcophagus]]
Sha-Amun-en-su was born circa the year 800 B.C., during the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt]]. Her name and almost all known information about her life come from the [[Hieroglyph|hieroglyphic inscriptions]] in her sarcophagus It is known that she was a "singer of Amun's sanctuary", that means, a singer with priestly assignments in the service of the Temple of Karnak  in the ancient city of Thebes (currently [[Luxor]]), devoted to the god [[Amun]]. Thebes was one of the most important religious centers in Ancient Egypt, congregating a complex of temples and hundreds of workers, among them priests, scribes, singers, musicians, managers and employees, with Karnak as its main temple.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brancaglion|first=Antonio|title=Sha-Amun-em-su Uma Cantora do Egito Antigo|url=http://www.academia.edu/36231588/Sha-Amun-em-su_Uma_Cantora_do_Egito_Antigo|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bakos, 1994, pp. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several categories of priestly singers at Amun's shrine. Sha-Amun-en-su belonged to the main group, called ''Heset'', women who exercised ritualistic functions and sang hymns in honor of the god Amun at sacred ceremonies and festivals, either as soloists or accompanied by female choirs. The  ''Heset'' tradition lasted in Thebes between the 9th to 6th centuries  B.C. Besides  singing the religious hymnns, they were responsible in hepling the "God's Wife of Amun" during the temple rites.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:Esquife_da_dama_Sha-amun-en-su_04.jpg|right|thumb|200x200px| Sha-Amun-en-su's sarcophagus]]
The ''Heset'' were not obliged to live permanently in the temple and many of them attended only for the execution of the ceremonies. Nevertheless, they obeyed to strict codes of conduct. Preferently, they had to stay [[Chastity|chaste]], but, even though not being virgins, they were considered extremely pure, to such extent as performing their gifts in such an important and symbolic edification as the temple of  Amun. Although they were not members of the Egyptian nobility, the singers were chosen among members of local elites and prepared for the function from an early age, being "adopted" by an older singer who served as their tutor and, in fact, as an "adoptive mother".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

There are no information about Sha-Amun-en-su's biilogical family or foster mother. It is likely that, like most Heset, she came from a wealthy family  traditionally linked to priestly activities. It is known, however, that sge had an "adopted daughter," based on the inscriptions of another sarcophagus currently preserved in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo — the casket of a singer called Merset-Amun, whose hieroglyphs report that she was "''daughter of Sha-Amun-en-su, singer of the shrine of Amun".'' Sha-Amun-en-su lived until around 50 years old, according to researches led by the National Museum's Laboratory of Egyptology. The death causes could not be determined.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Mummy ==
After the singer's death, her body was mummified by Egyptian priests and placed into a sarcophagus. Sha-Amun-en-su's coffin cover has never been removed, preventing the mummy from being studied by the naked eye. Thus, all analyzes of the coffin's inner structure and mummy status depended on X-ray examinations, computerized tomography, and three-dimensional scans. The set consisting of the sarcophagus and its mummy possessed great historical and scientific value, especially in relation to the knowledge of the funerary practices and rituals of the Temple of Ámon, since mummies of Egyptian singers are rare and even rarer are mummies of singers deposited in sealed coffins.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some features of the Sha-Amun-en-su mummification process were also quite specific and accentuated its rarity. Although most of the mummification process has followed traditional procedures, such as evisceration of the body and its wrapping with linen bandages, research coordinated by archaeologist {{ill|Antonio Brancaglion Junior|pt}}, curator of the Egyptian collection of the National Museum, revealed that the mummy's throat was covered with resin-coated bandages. This particularity indicates a concern of the mummifying priests to protect a zone seen as "vital" for a singer with ritualistic functions that, according to the Egyptian beliefs, would continue using her gift in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/serafina/2015/11/1697689-essa-e-a-mistura-do-brasil-com-o-egito-mumia-passeia-por-shopping-na-barra.shtml|title=Essa é a mistura do Brasil com o Egito: múmia passeia por shopping na Barra - 25/10/2015 - Serafina - Folha de S.Paulo|website=www1.folha.uol.com.br|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute of Oriental Studies at the [[University of Chicago]] preserves in its collection another mummy, also in a sealed sarcophagus, called [[Meresamun]] ("Amun's beloved", in Egyptian language). Like Sha-Amun-en-su, she was also a singer of the Amun temple during the 22nd Dynasty and her mummy also boasts a kind of protection in her throat. Meresamun was about 30 years old at her death. Her mouth and throat are lined with a padded protection, apparently made with pressed earth and bandages. Based on these common characteristics between the two mummies, Brancaglion hypothesized that there were specific standards of mummification for the women in charge of chanting hymns and songs in the Temple of Karnak.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Anatomical analysis of the Sha-Amun-en-su mummy failed to determine the cause of her death. It is known, anyway, that the singer was around 50 years old when she died. The mummy's body appeared to be in good condition, with no traumas or injuries. The examinations also allowed to observe a very rare dental curiosity: the mummy still kept almost all her teeth, missing only one. The Sha-Amun-en-su mummy also underwent a three-dimensional laser scan coordinated by Jorge Lopes, from the Tri-dimensional Experimentation Nucleus of the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro]]. That procedure allowed the generation of three-dimensional data files (called "orthogonal coordinates") that served as the basis for making a small-scale replica of the singer's skeleton.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Funerary artifacts ==
Computed tomography analysis, coordinated by radiologist Iugiro Kuroki, under the supervision of paleopathologist Sheila Mendonça of [[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation|Fiocruz]], identified several amulets with votive functions stored inside the coffin, including a heart-scarab, an artifact related to Egyptian belief in the resurrection of the dead. Sha-Amun-en-su's heart-scarab consisted of a green stone of oval shape, set in a gold plaque and attached to a golden cord, with the name of the singer written in hieroglyphs. These artifacts were often placed on the heart of the mummy and had the function of "replacing" it in cases in which the organ was extracted during the evisceration process. In this way the priests sought to preserve the "integrity" of the deceased in the afterlife, as well as the functions, states, characteristics, and other attributes that ancient Egyptians attached to the heart, such as intelligence and feelings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Sarcophagus ==
[[File:Caixão_de_Sha-Amun-En-Su.jpg|right|thumb|240x240px|Profile face detail on the sarcophagus of Sha-Amun-in-su.]]
The Sha-Amun-en-su sarcophagus was composed of box and lid, both carved in polychrome stuccoed wood.It was 1,58 meters high and was made around 750 BC. Throughout its nearly three millennia of history, since it had been sealed with the mummified body of the singer and her votive amulets, the sarcophagus had never been opened.It was a highly representative example of Egyptian funerary art from the 8th and 9th centuries BC, characterized by the profusion of references to [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolitan]] theology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The top of the sarcophagus cover was decorated with a female face, which sought to represent the natural color of the skin, topped with a blue headdress, decorated with yellow vulture wings and yellow and red ribbons. Shades of dark green, red and yellow stood out against a white background. At the breast height, there was the figure of the goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] and a representation of a ram-headed bird with wings outstretched over the lid, symbolizing protection. The bird's claws and tail were flanked by two [[uraeus]] serpents, one with the crown of [[Upper Egypt]] and one with the crown of [[Lower Egypt]] The four [[Sons of Horus]] were represented in two pairs, one pair in front of each snake.On the right side were [[Imset]] with a human head and [[Hapy]] with a baboon's head, and on the left side [[Duamutef]] with a jackal's head and [[Qebehsenuf]] with a hawk's head. In the region of the legs were represented the amulets of the god [[Osiris]], flanked by divinities. The two halves of the sarcophagus were separated by the sign [[Ankh]], the symbol of life, which was repeated in two other ribbons. Finally, there was a representation of the singer's [[Ba (soul)|Ba]] - Ba was understood at the same time as a spiritual component of human beings, gods and animals, as a metaphysical principle related to the individuality of being and as a dynamic element that separates from the body after death, approaching, in this sense, the Western concept of soul.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

At the back and outside of the sarcophagus was a representation of the great [[Djed]] pillar, a sign of stability associated with Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife, who ruled the underworld and the dead. In different parts of the coffin, there were bands with hieroglyphic inscriptions, analyzed and studied by different Egyptologists, such as [[Kenneth Kitchen]] and Alberto Childe. Kitchen was the first to identify the mummy, deciphering two bands of distinct hieroglyphs that associated her name to her occupation. The first band bore the inscription'' "An offering that the king makes [to] Osiris, Chief of the West, great God, Lord of Abydos - made for [?] The Singer of the Shrine [of Ammon], Sha-Amun-en-su "''. In the second line of hieroglyphs was read: "''An offering that the king makes [to] Ptah-Sokar-Osiris, Lord of the [shrine] Shetayet - made for [?] The Singer of the Shrine of Ammon, Sha-Amun-en-su"''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:D._Pedro_II_e_sua_comitiva_visitando_as_pirâmides_em_1876.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|Emperor Pedro II and  his entourage visiting the Egyptian pyramids, in 1876.]]
There is scarce information on the sarcophagus of Sha-Amun-en-su in the pre-nineteenth century period. There is no record of the date or exact archaeological site where the coffin was found (although it is known to come from the vast western Thebes complex), nor is there any information on the process of integrating the coffin into the [[Egyptian Khedivate]] collections.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1876, during the second visit of Emperor Dom Pedro II to Egypt, the sarcophagus was offered as a gift to the Brazilian monarch by Ismail Pasha. In return, Pedro II offered a book to the Khedive. An amateur Egyptologist and enthusiast of Egyptian culture, Pedro II had a special affection for the sarcophagus, which soon became one of the most relevant pieces of his private collection. The emperor kept him standing in his study in the [[Quinta da Boa Vista|Palace of São Cristóvão]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During its passage through the collection of Pedro II, the sarcophagus was damaged in the event of a storm. Knocked down by the wind, the sarcophagus fell, crashing into one of the emperor's office windows and having its left side fragmented. It was later restored, but the intervention would remain visible ever since. Other restorations would be carried out in the following decades aiming at eliminating, above all, the threats of termites and wasps, attracted by the oldness of the wood.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The sarcophagus remained in the Palace of São Cristóvão after the Proclamation of the Republic in 1889, and was later integrated into the collection of Egyptian archeology of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro. Since its integration into the museum collection, the sarcophagus has always been one of the most outstanding pieces of the collection, having served as the basis for a large number of scientific researches, theses and monographs, developed by researchers from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and others Brazilian scientific institutions and academics from different parts of the world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2015, commenting on the importance and uniqueness of the sarcophagus and the mummy of Sha-Amun-en-su, the curator of the Egyptian National Museum's collection, Antonio Brancaglion Junior, stated:
{{cquote|If you have a mummy, you have a mummy, if you have not, you won't get one anymore. If we lose it, we will never get anything else remotely similar. We have to keep it to the end.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;}}
On September 2, 2018, a major fire destroyed the building of the National Museum and much of the collection on display, including the sarcophagus of Sha-Amun-en-su, with its mummy and all the votive artifacts conserved within it. In the fire, the other mummies and sarcophagi of the collection, along with most of the archaeological collection, were also lost. The fire caused great commotion in the academic, scientific and cultural circles of Brazil and the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Estátua de frade em Almeirim.JPG|thumb|Statue of a monk and stone soup (''sopa da pedra'') in Almeirim, Portugal.]]
'''Stone Soup''' is an old [[Folklore|folk story]] in which hungry strangers convince the people of a town to each share a small amount of their food in order to make a meal that everyone enjoys, and exists as a [[Moral#In moral tales|moral]] regarding the value of sharing. In varying traditions, the stone has been replaced with other common inedible objects, and therefore the fable is also known as '''axe soup''', '''button soup''', '''nail soup''', and '''wood soup'''.

==Story==
Some travelers come to a village, carrying nothing more than an empty cooking pot. Upon their arrival, the villagers are unwilling to share any of their food stores with the hungry travelers. Then the travelers go to a stream and fill the pot with water, drop a large [[Rock (geology)|stone]] in it, and place it over a fire. One of the villagers becomes curious and asks what they are doing. The travelers answer that they are making "stone [[soup]]", which tastes wonderful and which they would be delighted to share with the villager, although it still needs a little bit of [[Garnish (food)|garnish]], which they are missing, to improve the flavor. 

The villager, who anticipates enjoying a share of the soup, does not mind parting with a few carrots, so these are added to the soup. Another villager walks by, inquiring about the pot, and the travelers again mention their stone soup which has not yet reached its full potential. The villager hands them a little bit of [[seasoning]]. More and more villagers walk by, each adding another ingredient. Finally, the stone (being inedible) is removed from the pot, and a delicious and nourishing pot of soup is enjoyed by travelers and villagers alike. Although the travelers have thus tricked the villagers into sharing their food with them, they have successfully transformed it into a tasty and nutritious meal which they share with the donors.

== Variations ==
*The [[Eastern Europe]]an variation of the story (which is similar to the Northern European rendition) is called "axe soup", with an [[axe]] as the catalyst.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

*In the [[French folklore|French]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Russians|Russian]] versions of the tale, the travelers are [[soldier]]s returning home.
**In the Hungarian version, a single starving soldier encounters several hardships on his journey back to his homeland.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} At the end of the story, he sells the rock to the villagers after eating the soup.
**In Russian tradition, a soldier prepares "axe [[kasha]]" ({{lang|ru|[[:s:ru:Каша из топора|Каша из топора]]}}).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

*[[Johann Peter Hebel]] wrote a [[German language|German]] version, "''Der schlaue Pilgrim''" ("The Cunning Pilgrim", 1811),&lt;ref name="Ashliman"/&gt; in which a wily [[pilgrim]], allegedly on his way to [[Jerusalem]], tricks a hostess step-by-step into adding rich soup ingredients to his [[Pebble|pebble stones]], finally leaving the stones uneaten.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

*In Northern European and [[Scandinavia]]n countries, the story is most commonly known as "nail soup", and the main character is typically a [[tramp]] looking for food and lodgings, who convinces an old woman that he will make a tasty [[Nail (fastener)|nail]] soup for the both of them if she would just add a few ingredients for the garnish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nail Soup - traditional swedish folk-tale|url = http://hem.fyristorg.com/kulturkemi/net/soup.htm|website = wayback.archive.org|accessdate = 2015-11-28|deadurl = bot: unknown|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20020316195723/http://hem.fyristorg.com/kulturkemi/net/soup.htm|archivedate = 2002-03-16|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*In the Portuguese tradition, the traveler is a [[monk]], and the story takes place around [[Almeirim]], Portugal. Nowadays {{lang|pt|sopa de pedra}} is considered a regional dish of Almeirim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cm-almeirim.pt/conhecer-almeirim/gastronomia/item/202-sopa-de-pedra-receitas |title=Sopa da Pedra - Receitas|trans-title= Stone soup - recipes|website=Almeirim Municipal Chamber |date=  |author=|language=Portuguese |accessdate= 18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In the Chinese version, three monks are the ones who place a stone into a pot and boil the soup. Villagers who are curious pass by and add ingredients such as carrots, rice wine, pepper, salt etc.

==Cultural and historical references==
In the [[Aarne-Thompson-Uther]] folktale classification system this tale and set of variants is type 1548.&lt;ref name="Ashliman"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Stone Soup: folktales of Aarne-Thompson-Uther type 1548 | work =D.

===Art, entertainment, and media===

===="Stone soup"-like collaborations====
There are many examples of projects referencing the "Stone Soup" story's theme of making something significant by accumulating lots of small contributions. Examples include: 
*''[[Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup]]'' a computer game which expanded on an abandoned project using contributions from many different coders; 
*''[[Stone Soup (magazine)|Stone Soup]]'', a children's literary magazine published by the California-based Children’s Art Foundation since 1973; 
*[[Stone Soupercomputer]], a computer composed of many small units;

===Adaptations===

====Film====
The film ''[[Fandango (1985 film)|Fandango]]'' (1985) contains a wedding sequence towards the end which builds on the Stone Soup theme. The protagonists need to hold a wedding ceremony, but they lack any funds to do so. Therefore, they set up a folding [[card table]] by the main street of a sleepy Texas town, dust it off, and invite passersby to come to the wedding. As they concoct stories of delinquent caterers and crashed champagne trucks, the friendly townspeople contribute their time and resources, the result being a magical wedding ceremony.

====Literature====
[[William Butler Yeats]]' play, ''The Pot of Broth'' (1904), tells a version of the story in which a clever Irish tramp uses his wits to swindle a shrewish medieval housewife out of her dinner.{{sfn|Yeats|2010|pages=109–119}}

The story is the basis of [[Marcia Brown]]'s 1947 children's book, ''Stone Soup'' (1947),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Marcia|authorlink=Marcia Brown|title=Stone Soup (1947)|year=2005|isbn=978-0689878367|publisher=[[Aladdin Paperbacks]]|location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which features soldiers tricking miserly villages into cooking them a feast. The book was a [[Caldecott Honor]] book in 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stone Soup, 1948 Honor|url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/caldecotthonors/1948honorstonesoup|publisher=Association for Library Service to Children|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was read aloud by the Captain (played by [[Bob Keeshan]]) on an early episode of ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'' in the 1950s, as well as at least once in the 1960s or early 1970s.{{sfn|Spicer; Disbrowe|2007|page=9}}{{sfn|Bradbury|2010|page=66}}

In 1965, [[Gordon R. Dickson]] published a short story called "Soupstone", where a headstrong pilot is sent to solve a problem on a planet under the guise of a highly educated and competent official. He succeeds by pretending to understand everything, but actually merely making the locals apply their already present knowledge and abilities to the task.

"Stone Soup" (1968),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Stone-Soup-Ann-Mcgovern/dp/0590416022|title=Stone Soup (1968)|date=1986|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Inc]]|isbn=978-0590416023|last=McGovern|first=Ann|authorlink=Ann McGovern|edition=Reissue}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Ann McGovern]] and illustrated by Nola Langner, tells the story of a little old lady and a hungry young man at the door asking for food, and he tricks her into making stone soup.

Canadian children's author Aubrey Davis adapted the story to a [[Jewish]] context in his book ''Bone Button Borscht'' (1996). According to Davis, he wrote the story when he was unable to find a story that he liked for a [[Hanukkah]] reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Aubrey|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Bone_Button_Borscht.html?id=751hAAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Bone Button Borscht|year=2002|publisher=Turtleback Books|location=[[St. Louis]]|isbn=978-0613991032}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Budd]]'s narration of ''Bone Button Borscht'' traditionally airs across Canada on [[CBC Radio One]]'s ''[[As It Happens]]'', on the first day of [[Hanukkah]].

[[Jon J. Muth]]'s children's book based on the story, also called ''Stone Soup'' (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Jon J. Muth|first=Jon J.|last=Muth|title=Stone Soup|year=2003|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Press]]|location=[[New York City]]|url=https://www.amazon.com/Stone-Soup-Jon-J-Muth/dp/043933909X|edition=1st|isbn=978-0439339094}}&lt;/ref&gt; is set in [[China]], as is [[Ying Chang Compestine|Ying Chang's]] ''[[The Real Story of Stone Soup]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-3107728801.html|title=Stone Soup: A Story about Using Story for Research|last=Kimmel|first=Sue|date=July 2013|work=School Libraries Worldwide|access-date=31 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801034300/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-3107728801.html|archive-date=2017-08-01|dead-url=yes|subscription=|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Music====
[[Shel Silverstein]]'s song, "The Wonderful Soup Stone", tells a version of this story. [[Bobby Bare]] included the song on his album ''Lullabys, Legends and Lies'' (1973).&lt;ref name="Amazon entry"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Bobby Bare Sings Lullabies Legends &amp; Lies|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bobby-Bare-Sings-Lullabies-Legends/dp/B000ROAL8K|work=[[Amazon.com]]|location=[[Seattle]]|accessdate=October 1, 2013}},&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dr. Hook &amp; The Medicine Show]] included the song on their album ''Belly Up!'' (1973).

A version of the tale written by [[Tom Chapin]] and [[John Forster (musician)|John Forster]] appears on Chapin's album ''Mother Earth'' (1990).

====Television====
*[[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[The Storyteller (TV series)|The Storyteller]]'' series contains one tale called "A Story Short", in which the Storyteller himself (played by [[John Hurt]]) is the main character. In the beginning, he arrives at a castle where a man is thrown out for begging for food. He proceeds to trick the King's cook into making stone soup. After the people are happily fed, the cook realizes what has happened and pleads with the King to let him boil the Storyteller in oil, but the King instead offers a way out — to tell him a story every day for a year instead.
*The [[PBS Kids]] show ''[[Between the Lions]]'' featured an episode with a version of the story being read. In this version, the strangers were replaced by aliens.
* The tale was adapted as an episode of the show ''[[Hungarian Folktales]]''.
* A [[:ru:Каша из топора|Soviet cartoon]] based on the Russian variant of the tale was made in 1982.

===Lucky Iron Fish===
A contemporary twist on "nail soup" helps relieve real-world [[iron deficiency anemia]] in [[Cambodia]]. The [[lucky iron fish|Lucky Iron Fish]] is a [[cast iron]] bar in the shape of the "Try Kantrop" fish that many villagers consider lucky. When immersed into a simmering pot of soup, enough of the iron dissolves into the liquid to add the critical amounts of a trace nutrient needed to prevent certain types of anemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/12/25/434942455/in-cambodia-lucky-iron-fish-for-the-cooking-pot-could-fight-anemia|work=The Salt (NPR Morning Edition)|author=Sullivan, Michael (Host)|title=In Cambodia, 'Lucky' Iron Fish For The Cooking Pot Could Fight Anemia |date=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military tactics===
US Army General [[George S. Patton, Jr.]] referred to the "rock soup method" of acquiring resources for attacks in the face of official disapproval by his superiors for offensive operations. In the military context, he sent units forward, ostensibly on reconnaissance missions, to later reinforce them when resistance was met, and these missions eventually turned small scale probes into all out attacks; he notably did this during the [[Battle of Sicily]], in the advance on [[Palermo]], and again in the campaign in northwest Europe, notably near [[Metz]] when his [[3rd US Army]] was officially halted during [[Operation Market Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farago|first=Ladislas |title=Patton: Ordeal and Triumph (1970)|publisher=Westholme Publishing LLC|year=2005|location=[[Yardley, Pennsylvania]]|url=https://www.amazon.com/Patton-Ordeal-Triumph-Ladislas-Farago/dp/1594160112|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Places===
The big pool at Karl Johan street in Oslo, funded by the steel company ''Christiania Spigerverk'' ("Christiania Nail Factory"),  is nicknamed ''[[Spikersuppa]]'' ("Nail Soup") as a humorous reference to the story.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5547">[[Image:Dokumentation av hällristningar - frottage.JPG|thumb|150px|right|A '''stone rubbing''' (graphite on paper) for documentation of a [[petroglyph]].]]
'''Stone rubbing''' is the practice of creating an image of surface features of a stone on paper.  The image records features such as natural textures, inscribed patterns or lettering.  By rubbing hard rendering materials over the paper, pigment is deposited over protrusions and on edges; depressions remain unpigmented since the pliable paper moves away from the rendering material.  Common rendering materials include [[Charcoal#Art|charcoal]], [[crayon|wax]], [[Pencil|graphite]] or [[inkstick]]s.  Over time, the practice of stone rubbing can cause permanent damage to cultural monuments due to abrasion.  For an artist, stone rubbings can become an entire body of creative work that is framed and displayed.

==Technique==

The paper that has been used by Chinese scholars to transfer the calligraphy from stones is made from plant fiber. It can be used in two ways to retrieve the calligraphy. One way requires the paper to be dry and then adhered to the stone through a paste made with water and a starch that is made from rice or wheat. The paper is then tamped into the engravings on the stone. The other technique requires the paper to be wet and tamped into the engravings without a paste. &lt;ref name=Perkins&gt;Perkins, Dorothy. “stone rubbings, Chinese.” Encyclopedia of China: The Essential Reference to China, Its History and Culture. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 1998. Ancient and Medieval History Online. Facts On File, Inc. 28 Jan. 2010 &lt;[http://www.fofweb.com/activelink2.asp?ItemID=WE49&amp;iPin=china02225&amp;SingleRecord=True]&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

After doing either of these techniques, an ink, created through grinding an ink stick and adding water one drop at a time to achieve the ideal consistency, is used to retrieve the calligraphy. The ink is stippled on with a cloth filled with the ink. The ink covers the paper without sinking into the engravings. When the paper is peeled off, the calligraphy engravings come out white, while everything else is black from the ink. &lt;ref name=Perkins /&gt;

More commonly, people use butcher paper to create stone rubbings. The butcher paper is usually taped on to the stone or grave, which contains the inscription desired, with either masking or paint tape. Then, usually, charcoal or crayon is rubbed over the stone or grave, leaving the engravings untouched by the crayon. When the butcher paper is removed, the inscriptions should be readable because they are not marked with the crayon.&lt;ref name=Ancestry&gt;“Headstone Art.” Ancestry. July/August 2008: 55. Print. &lt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NDgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=grave+rubbing&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=grave%20rubbing&amp;f=false]&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be helpful to clean the stone beforehand, to ensure optimum results. A soft brush and water is usually what works best to cleanse the stones. One should not use stiff or hard brushes, as they can scratch the stone. Also, one should not use cleaning solutions or mild detergents on the stones, as they can damage the stone. &lt;ref name=MSP&gt;“Cemeteries.” Massachusetts Studies Project. 28 Jan. 2010 &lt;[http://www.msp.umb.edu/LocHistoryTemplates/MSPCemeteries.html]&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

When stone rubbing, one should be careful with stones that are deteriorating, as they can collapse under pressure.&lt;ref name=MSP/&gt;

==Gravestone rubbing==


'''Gravestone rubbing''' also applies this technique to [[gravestone]]s, often as a method of retrieving and conserving information about [[genealogy]]. For a genealogist, a gravestone rubbing may become a permanent record of death when a gravestone is rapidly deteriorating. 

Rubbings are commonly made by visitors to the US [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| author = Tamara L. Britton
| title = The Vietnam Veterans Memorial
| publisher = Checkerboard Books
| year = 2004
| pages = 
| isbn = 1-59197-523-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Visitors use pencil and paper to copy the name of a family member or friend who died during the [[Vietnam War]] off of the wall.  The rubbing forms a type of souvenir.

Gravestone rubbing can be used to teach about local history.  The stone’s condition, art, and inscription can tell what was going on in an area at a specific time.  Studying multiple gravestones in one specific area can give even more information about history.&lt;ref name=MSP/&gt;

==Composition==
The symphony has a duration of roughly 24 minutes and is composed in four [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
#Drammatico
#Allegro sfumato
#Paesaggio: andante
#Tempo giusto

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a large orchestra comprising three [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (doubling [[piccolo]] and [[alto flute]]), three [[oboe]]s (doubling [[Cor anglais|English horn]]), three [[clarinet]]s (doubling [[bass clarinet]]), three [[bassoon]]s (doubling [[contrabassoon]]), four [[French horn|horns]], two [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], six percussionists, [[Pedal harp|harp]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewing a 1989 performance by the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], Lesley Valdes of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' wrote, "Although it sometimes overstresses its points, the symphony has heft and atmosphere."   She added:{{quote|The symphony does not lack for musical ideas, which appear to be organized tidily; some are presented with fine imagination. Atmosphere, more than dramatic import, appears the composer's suit; and for ideas and atmospheric effect, one most admired the work's inner movements. The second, a sort of scherzo, features the woodwinds in lissome questionings that are summarily answered by the horns. The andante offers the sort of shimmery-to-sustained string playing that calls to mind foggy landscapes a la Eugene O'Neill; its melancholy state was excellently indicated by conductor and ensemble alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Valdes |first=Lesley |title=Comet Leads Philadelphia Orchestra |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=October 6, 1989 |url=http://articles.philly.com/1989-10-06/entertainment/26116915_1_catherine-comet-philadelphia-orchestra-high-notes |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''The Five Senses''''' is a set of [[Allegory|allegorical]] paintings created at [[Antwerp]] in 1617&amp;ndash;18 by [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens]], with Brueghel being responsible for the settings and Rubens for the figures. They are now in the [[Prado Museum]] in [[Madrid]]. They are all painted in [[Oil painting|oils]] on wood panel, approximately {{convert|65|x|110|cm|ftin}} in dimensions.

The series constitutes one of the best known and most successful collaborations by Brueghel and Rubens, who were close friends.&lt;ref name=Suchtelen90&gt;Ariane van Suchtelen, "8.

==Description==
Rubens painted the allegorical female figures, accompanied by a [[putto]] or a winged [[Cupid]] in ''Sight'', ''Hearing'', ''Smell'' and ''Touch'', by a [[satyr]] in ''Taste''. Brueghel created the sumptuous settings, which evoke the splendour of the court of [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]], and his wife [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]], governors of the [[Spanish Netherlands]], to which the two artists were attached.&lt;ref name=Suchtelen90/&gt; (The eroticism of the figures' near-nudity has been related to ecstasy in luxury.&lt;ref name=web&gt;Emil Krén and Daniel Marx, [http://www.wga.hu/html_m/b/bruegel/jan_e/2/5sense1.html ''The Sense of Hearing''], Web Gallery, retrieved 11 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Thus, in ''Sight'' the female figure is contemplating a painting of Christ's restoring the sight of a blind man, in a [[cabinet of curiosities]] full of pictures, antique busts, ''objets d'art'', and scientific instruments. The figure in ''Hearing'' is playing the [[lute]] amongst a collection of musical instruments and clocks. In ''Smell'', she sits among flowers in a garden, with a perfume distillery visible on the left. In ''Taste'', seated at a table groaning with food fit for a banquet, she is eating an oyster and a satyr is filling her glass. In ''Touch'', she embraces a putto in a superbly equipped armoury where there are also medical instruments, pain being an aspect of touch.&lt;ref&gt;Van Suchtelen, pp. 90, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c1cGWlxdP64C&amp;q=Senses#v=onepage&amp;q=1636%2C%20when%20the%20paintings%20were%20listed%20in%20an%20inventory&amp;f=false 94], 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the details relate to the theme: for example, in ''Sight'' the paintings which can be seen range through almost every genre, and include ''St Cecilia'', the patroness of eyesight, and the inclusion of both real and painted garlands of flowers alludes to the contemporary debate about the relative status of art and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Van Suchtelen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c1cGWlxdP64C&amp;q=Senses#v=onepage&amp;q=entire%20Antwerp%20school%20&amp;f=false p. 96].&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has been suggested that Albert and Isabella commissioned the set, since many details refer to them: three of the paintings show their palaces in the background, and ''Sight'' depicts a double portrait of the couple and a portrait of Albert on horseback, as well as a double-headed Habsburg eagle on the chandelier.&lt;ref name=Suchtelen94&gt;Van Suchtelen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c1cGWlxdP64C&amp;q=Senses#v=onepage&amp;q=1636%2C%20when%20the%20paintings%20were%20listed%20in%20an%20inventory&amp;f=false p. 94].&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Hearing'', the music is a [[madrigal]] dedicated to the couple.&lt;ref name=web/&gt;

==History==
[[Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg]], is the first known owner of the series of paintings; he presented them in 1634 to the [[Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria]], who had just become governor of the Spanish Netherlands following the deaths of Albert and Isabella. Ferdinand in turn offered them through the Duke of [[Medina de las Torres]] to his brother King [[Philip IV of Spain]], who hung them in the reading room at the [[Royal Alcazar of Madrid]].&lt;ref name=Suchtelen94/&gt; They were subsequently housed in other royal palaces in Madrid and became part of the founding collection of the Prado in 1819.&lt;ref name=PradoSight/&gt;

'''''The Man Who Came Back''''' is a 2008 American film directed by [[Glen Pitre]]. It stars [[Eric Braeden]], [[Billy Zane]], [[George Kennedy]], and [[Armand Assante]]. Set in southern Louisiana, it is loosely based on the 1887 sugar strike in four parishes and violence that erupted in the [[Thibodaux Massacre]].

==Plot==
''The Man Who Came Back'' is loosely based on the [[Thibodaux massacre]]. This was the culmination of the largest strike in the sugar cane industry, when 10,000 workers stopped labor, and the first to be conducted by a formal labor organization, the [[Knights of Labor]]. With an estimated 50 or more African-American cane workers killed by white [[paramilitary]] forces, it was the second bloodiest [[labor strike]] in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nola.com/michaelkleinschrodt/2008/12/brutal_man_who_came_back_is_an.html|title=Brutal 'Man Who Came Back' is an unsatisfying story of revenge from Louisiana filmmaker Glen Pitre|work=Michael Kleinschrodt|accessdate=June 19, 2016|date=December 4, 2008|first=Michael|last=Kleinschrodt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Reconstruction and white Democrats regaining control of the state government, in the late 1880s, freedmen worked hard on sugar cane plantations but were bound by many of the planters' practices. They were sometimes paid only in [[scrip]], redeemable only at the plantation's overpriced store, and the workers struggled to get out of debt and be able to leave a plantation.

In an attempt to better their lives, the workers strike. This leads to massive retaliation by the most powerful men in the town, including the sheriff ([[Armand Assante]]), the preacher ([[Al Hayter]]), power-hungry Billy Duke ([[James Patrick Stuart]]), and his vigilante group of thugs.

White overseer Reese Paxton ([[Eric Braeden]]) steps up to demand justice for his workers. Duke's rage turns on Paxton and his family. Despite assistance from a Yankee attorney ([[Billy Zane]]), Paxton is convicted in a trial presided by Judge Duke ([[George Kennedy]]), Billy's father.

After being sent to prison, beaten within inches of his life, and enduring emotional torture, Paxton "comes back" to seek revenge.

He further stated that the book would be a great chance to reach his audience "in a new way."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = YouTube star PewDiePie strikes publishing deal for This Book Loves You|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/11/youtube-pewdiepie-this-book-loves-you|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 2015-06-11|access-date = 2016-01-25|issn = 0261-3077|language = en-GB|first = Stuart|last = Dredge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|valkyrja}} "chooser of the slain") is one of a host of female figures who choose those who may die in battle and those who may live. Selecting among half of those who die in battle (the other half go to the goddess [[Freyja]]'s afterlife field {{lang|non|[[Fólkvangr]]}}), the valkyries bring their chosen to the afterlife hall of the slain, [[Valhalla]], ruled over by the god [[Odin]]. There, the deceased warriors become {{lang|non|[[einherjar]]}} ([[Old Norse]] "single (or once) fighters"&lt;ref name=ORCHARD36LINDOW104&gt;Orchard (1997:36) and Lindow (2001:104).&lt;/ref&gt;). When the {{lang|non|einherjar}} are not preparing for the events of [[Ragnarök]], the valkyries bear them [[mead]]. Valkyries also appear as lovers of heroes and other mortals, where they are sometimes described as the daughters of royalty, sometimes accompanied by [[raven]]s and sometimes connected to [[swan]]s or [[horse]]s.

Valkyries are attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' (a book of poems compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources), the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', the {{lang|non|[[Heimskringla]]}} (both by [[Snorri Sturluson]]) and the {{lang|non|[[Njáls saga]]}} (one of the [[Sagas of Icelanders]]), all written—or compiled—in the 13th century. They appear throughout the poetry of [[skald]]s, in a 14th-century [[magical formula|charm]], and in various [[runic inscriptions]].

The [[Old English]] [[cognate]] terms {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} and {{lang|ang|wælcyrie}} appear in several Old English manuscripts, and scholars have explored whether the terms appear in Old English by way of Norse influence, or reflect a tradition also native among the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Anglo-Saxon pagans]]. Scholarly theories have been proposed about the relation between the valkyries, the [[Norns]], and the {{lang|non|[[dís]]ir}}, all of which are supernatural figures associated with fate. Archaeological excavations throughout Scandinavia have uncovered amulets theorized as depicting valkyries. In modern culture, valkyries have been the subject of works of art, musical works, comic books, video games and poetry.

==Etymology==
The word ''valkyrie'' derives from [[Old Norse]] ''{{linktext|valkyrja|lang=non}}'' (plural {{lang|non|valkyrjur}}), which is composed of two words: the noun ''{{linktext|valr|lang=non}}'' (referring to the slain on the battlefield) and the verb ''{{linktext|kjósa|lang=non}}'' (meaning "to choose"). Together, they mean 'chooser of the slain'. The Old Norse {{lang|non|valkyrja}} is cognate to [[Old English]] ''{{linktext|wælcyrge|lang=ang}}''.&lt;ref name="BYOCK142-143"&gt;Byock (2005:142–143).&lt;/ref&gt; From the Old English and Old Norse forms, [[philology|philologist]] [[Vladimir Orel]] reconstructs the [[Proto-Germanic]] form {{lang|gem-x-proto|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/walakuzjǭ|wala-kuzjōn]]}}.&lt;ref name="OREL-442"&gt;Orel (2003:442).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term may have been borrowed into Old English from Old Norse: see discussion in the [[#Old English attestations|Old English attestations]] section below.

Other terms for valkyries in Old Norse sources include {{lang|non|óskmey}} ("wish maid"), appearing in the poem {{lang|non|[[Oddrúnargrátr]]}} and  {{lang|non|Óðins [[wikt:mey|meyjar]]}} ("[[Odin]]'s maids"), appearing in the {{lang|non|[[Nafnaþulur]]}}. {{lang|non|Óskmey}} may be related to the [[List of names of Odin|Odinic name {{lang|non|Óski|nocat=y}}]] (roughly meaning "wish fulfiller"), referring to the fact that Odin receives slain warriors in Valhalla.&lt;ref name="SIMEK254+349"&gt;Simek (2007:254 and 349).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Norse attestations==

===''Poetic Edda''===
Valkyries are mentioned or appear in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' poems ''[[Völuspá]]'', ''[[Grímnismál]]'', ''[[Völundarkviða]]'', ''[[Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar]]'', ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana I]]'', ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]'' and ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]''.

====''Völuspá'' and ''Grímnismál''====
[[File:Hild, Thrud and Hløkk by Frølich.jpg|thumb|The valkyries Hildr, Þrúðr and Hlökk bearing ale in Valhalla (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]]]]
In stanza 30 of the poem ''[[Völuspá]]'', a [[völva]] (a travelling [[seeress]] in Norse society) tells Odin that "she saw" valkyries coming from far away who are ready to ride to "the realm of the gods". The völva follows this with a list of six valkyries: [[Skuld]] (Old Norse, possibly "debt" or "future") who "bore a shield", [[Skögul]] ("shaker"), [[Gunnr]] ("war"), [[Hildr]] ("battle"), [[Göndul]] ("[[wand]]-wielder") and [[Geirskögul]] ("Spear-Skögul"). Afterwards, the völva tells him she has listed the "ladies of the War Lord, ready to ride, valkyries, over the earth".&lt;ref name="DRONKE15ORCHARD193-195"&gt;Dronke (1997:15). Valkyrie name etymologies from Orchard (1995:193–195).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the poem ''[[Grímnismál]]'', Odin (disguised as ''[[List of names of Odin|Grímnir]]''), tortured, starved and thirsty, tells the young [[Agnarr Geirröðsson|Agnar]] that he wishes that the valkyries [[Hrist]] ("shaker") and [[Mist (valkyrie)|Mist]] ("cloud") would "bear him a [drinking] [[drinking horn|horn]]", then provides a list of 11 more valkyries who he says "bear [[ale]] to the [[einherjar]]"; [[Skeggjöld]] ("axe-age"), Skögul, Hildr, [[Þrúðr]] ("power"), [[Hlökk]] ("noise", or "battle"), [[Herfjötur]] ("host-fetter"), [[Göll]] ("tumult"), [[Geirahöð]] ("spear-fight"), [[Randgríð]] ("shield-truce"), [[Ráðgríð]] ("council-truce") and [[Reginleif]] ("power-truce").&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON57ORCHARD193-195"&gt;Larrington (1999:57). Valkyrie name etymologies from Orchard (1995:193–195).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Völundarkviða''====
[[File:Walkyrien by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|''Walkyrien'' (c. 1905) by [[Emil Doepler]]]]
A prose introduction in the poem ''[[Völundarkviða]]'' relates that the brothers [[Slagfiðr]], [[Agilaz|Egil]] and [[Wayland Smith|Völund]] dwelt in a house sited in a location called Úlfdalir ("wolf dales"). There, early one morning, the brothers find three women spinning linen on the shore of the lake Úlfsjár ("wolf lake"), and "near them were their swan's garments; they were valkyries". Two daughters of King Hlödvér are named [[Hlaðguðr svanhvít]] ("swan-white") and [[Hervör alvitr]] (possibly meaning "all-wise" or "strange creature"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD83"&gt;Orchard (1997:83).&lt;/ref&gt;); the third, daughter of [[Kjárr]] of [[Valland]], is named [[Alruna|Ölrún]] (possibly meaning "[[beer]] [[runic alphabet|rune]]"&lt;ref name="SIMEK251"&gt;Simek (2007:251).&lt;/ref&gt;). The brothers take the three women back to their hall with them—Egil takes Ölrún, Slagfiðr takes Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund takes Hervör alvitr. They live together for seven winters, until the women fly off to go to a battle and do not return. Egil goes off in snow-shoes to look for Ölrún, Slagfiðr goes searching for Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund sits in Úlfdalir.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON102"&gt;Larrington (1999:102).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar''====
[[File:ValkyrieOnHorse.jpg|thumb|''Valkyrie'' (1908) by [[Stephan Sinding]] located in [[Churchillparken|Churchill Park]] at [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|Kastellet]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark]]
In the poem ''[[Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar]]'', a prose narrative says that an unnamed and silent young man, the son of the Norwegian King Hjörvarðr and Sigrlinn of Sváfaland, witnesses nine valkyries riding by while sitting atop a [[Tumulus#Scandinavia|burial mound]]. He finds one particularly striking; this valkyrie is detailed later in a prose narrative as [[Sváfa|Sváva]], King Eylimi's daughter, who "often protected him in battles". The valkyrie speaks to the unnamed man, and gives him the name ''[[Helge (name)|Helgi]]'' (meaning "the [[hallow|holy]] one"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD81"&gt;Orchard (1997:81).&lt;/ref&gt;). The previously silent Helgi speaks; he refers to the valkyrie as "bright-face lady", and asks her what gift he will receive with the [[Germanic name|name]] she has bestowed upon him, but he will not accept it if he cannot have her as well. The valkyrie tells him she knows of a hoard of swords in Sigarsholm, and that one of them is of particular importance, which she describes in detail.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON125"&gt;Larrington (1999:125).&lt;/ref&gt; Further into the poem, Atli [[flyting|flytes]] with the female [[jötunn]] [[Hrímgerðr]]. While flyting with Atli, Hrímgerðr says that she had seen 27 valkyries around Helgi, yet one particularly fair valkyrie led the band:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:[[Numbers in Germanic paganism|Three times nine girls]], but one girl rode ahead,
:white-skinned under her helmet;
:the horses were trembling, from their manes
:dew fell into the deep valleys,
:hail in the high woods;
:good fortune comes to men from there;
:all that I saw was hateful to me.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON128"&gt;Larrington (1999:128).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After Hrímgerðr is turned to stone by the daylight, a prose narrative continues that Helgi, who is now king, goes to Sváva's father—King Eylimi—and asks for his daughter. Helgi and Sváva are betrothed and love one another dearly. Sváva stays at home with King Eylimi, and Helgi goes raiding, and to this the narrative adds that Sváva "was a valkyrie just as before".&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON129"&gt;Larrington (1999:129).&lt;/ref&gt; The poem continues, and, among various other events, Helgi dies from a wound received in battle. A narrative at the end of the poem says that Helgi and his valkyrie wife Sváva "are said to be reincarnated".&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON130-131"&gt;Larrington (1999:130–131).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Helgakviða Hundingsbana I''====
[[File:Helgi Hundingsbane and Sigrún by Robert Engels.jpg|thumb|[[Helgi Hundingsbane]] and Sigrún (1919) by [[Robert Engels]]]]
In the poem ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana I]]'', the hero [[Helgi Hundingsbane]] sits in the corpse-strewn battlefield of Logafjöll. A light shines from the [[fell]], and from that light strike bolts of lightning. Flying through the sky, helmeted valkyries appear. Their waist-length [[Mail (armour)|mail armour]] is drenched in blood; their spears shine brightly:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Then light shone from Logafell,
:and from that radiance there came bolts of lightning;
:wearing helmets at Himingvani [came the valkyries].
:Their byrnies were drenched in blood;
:and rays shone from their spears.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON116"&gt;Larrington (1999:116).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the stanza that follows, Helgi asks the valkyries (who he refers to as "southern goddesses") if they would like to come home with the warriors when night falls (all the while arrows were flying). The battle over, the valkyrie [[Sigrún]] ("victory-[[runic alphabet|rune]]"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD194"&gt;Orchard (1997:194).&lt;/ref&gt;), informs him from her horse that her father [[Högni]] has betrothed her to [[Höðbroddr]], the son of king [[Granmar]] of the [[Nibelung|Hniflung]] clan, who Sigrún deems unworthy. Helgi assembles an immense host to ride to wage battle at Frekastein against the Hniflung clan to assist Sigrún in her plight to avoid her betrothment.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON116-117"&gt;Larrington (1999:116–117).&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the poem, the hero [[Sinfjötli]] [[flyting|flyts]] with Guðmundr. Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been female, and gibes that Guðmundr was "a witch, horrible, unnatural, among Odin's valkyries", adding that all of the einherjar "had to fight, headstrong woman, on your account".&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON119"&gt;Larrington (1999:119).&lt;/ref&gt; Further in the poem, the phrase "the valkyrie's airy sea" is used for "[[mist]]".&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON120"&gt;Larrington (1999:120).&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the poem, valkyries again descend from the sky, this time to protect Helgi amid the battle at Frekastein. After the battle, all the valkyries fly away but Sigrún and wolves (referred to as "the [[troll]]-woman's mount") consume corpses:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Helmeted valkyries came down from the sky
:—the noise of spears grew loud—they protected the prince;
:then said Sigrun—the wound-giving valkyries flew,
:the [[troll]]-woman's mount was feasting on the fodder of ravens:&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON121"&gt;Larrington (1999:121).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The battle won, Sigrún tells Helgi that he will become a great ruler and pledges herself to him.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON122"&gt;Larrington (1999:122).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Helgakviða Hundingsbana II''====
[[File:Helgi und Sigrun by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|''Helgi und Sigrun'' (1901) by [[Johannes Gehrts]]]]
At the beginning of the poem ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]'', a prose narrative says that King [[Sigmund]] (son of [[Völsung]]) and his wife [[Borghild]] (of Brálund) have a son named Helgi, who they named for Helgi Hjörvarðsson (the antagonist of the earlier ''Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar'').&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON132"&gt;Larrington (1999:132).&lt;/ref&gt; After Helgi has killed King Hunding in stanza 4, a prose narrative says that Helgi escapes, consumes the raw meat of cattle he has slaughtered on a beach, and encounters Sigrún. Sigrún, daughter of King Högni, is "a valkyrie and rode through air and sea", and she is the valkyrie Sváva reincarnated.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON133"&gt;Larrington (1999:133).&lt;/ref&gt; In stanza 7, Sigrún uses the phrase "fed the [[goose|gosling]] of Gunn's sisters". Gunnr and her sisters are valkyries, and these goslings are [[raven]]s, who feed on the corpses left on the battlefield by warriors.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON133+281"&gt;Larrington (1999:133 and 281).&lt;/ref&gt;

After stanza 18, a prose narrative relates that Helgi and his immense fleet of ships are heading to Frekastein, but encounter a great storm. Lightning strikes one of the ships. The fleet sees nine valkyries flying through the air, among whom they recognise Sigrún. The storm abates, and the fleets arrive safely at land.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON135"&gt;Larrington (1999:135).&lt;/ref&gt; Helgi dies in battle, yet returns to visit Sigrún from Valhalla once in a burial mound, and at the end of the poem, a prose epilogue explains that Sigrún later dies of grief. The epilogue details that "there was a belief in the pagan religion, which we now reckon [is] an old wives' tale, that people could be reincarnated" and that "Helgi and Sigrun were thought to have been reborn" as another Helgi and valkyrie couple; Helgi as Helgi Haddingjaskaði and Sigrún as the daughter of [[Halfdan]]; the valkyrie [[Kára]]. The epilogue details that further information about the two can be found in the (now lost) work ''[[Káruljóð]]''.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON141"&gt;Larrington (1999:141).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Sigrdrífumál''====
[[File:Ring48.jpg|upright|thumb|The valkyrie [[Sigrdrífa]] says a [[Norse paganism|pagan Norse]] prayer in ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]''. Illustration (1911) by [[Arthur Rackham]].]]
In the prose introduction to the poem ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]'', the hero [[Sigurd]] rides up to Hindarfell and heads south towards "the land of the [[Franks]]". On the mountain Sigurd sees a great light, "as if fire were burning, which blazed up to the sky". Sigurd approaches it, and there he sees a ''skjaldborg'' with a banner flying overhead. Sigurd enters the ''skjaldborg'', and sees a warrior lying there—asleep and fully armed. Sigurd removes the helmet of the warrior, and sees the face of a woman. The woman's [[corslet]] is so tight that it seems to have grown into the woman's body. Sigurd uses his sword [[Gram (mythology)|Gram]] to cut the corslet, starting from the neck of the corslet downwards, he continues cutting down her sleeves, and takes the corslet off of her.&lt;ref name="THORPE180"&gt;Thorpe (1907:180).&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman wakes, sits up, looks at Sigurd, and the two converse in two stanzas of verse. In the second stanza, the woman explains that Odin placed a sleeping spell on her she could not break, and due to that spell she has been asleep a long time. Sigurd asks for her name, and the woman gives Sigurd a [[drinking horn|horn]] of [[mead]] to help him retain her words in his memory. The woman recites a heathen [[prayer]] in two stanzas. A prose narrative explains that the woman is named [[Sigrdrífa]] and that she is a valkyrie.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON166-167"&gt;Larrington (1999:166–167).&lt;/ref&gt;

A narrative relates that Sigrdrífa explains to Sigurd that there were two kings fighting one another. Odin had promised one of these—Hjalmgunnar—victory in battle, yet she had "brought down" Hjalmgunnar in battle. Odin pricked her with a sleeping-thorn in consequence, told her she would never again "fight victoriously in battle", and condemned her to marriage. In response, Sigrdrífa told Odin she had sworn a great oath that she would never wed a man who knew fear. Sigurd asks Sigrdrífa to share with him her wisdom of all worlds. The poem continues in verse, where Sigrdrífa provides Sigurd with knowledge in inscribing [[runic alphabet|runes]], mystic wisdom, and prophecy.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON167"&gt;Larrington (1999:167).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Prose Edda''===
[[File:Valkyrie (1834-1835) by H. W. Bissen.jpg|thumb|''Valkyrie'' (1835) by [[Herman Wilhelm Bissen]]]]
In the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]], valkyries are first mentioned in chapter 36 of the book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', where the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] informs [[Gylfi|Gangleri]] (King [[Gylfi]] in disguise) of the activities of the valkyries and mentions a few goddesses. High says "there are still others whose duty it is to serve in Valhalla. They bring drink and see to the table and the ale cups." Following this, High gives a stanza from the poem ''Grímnismál'' that contains a list of valkyries. High says "these women are called valkyries, and they are sent by Odin to every battle, where they choose which men are to die and they determine who has victory". High adds that [[Gunnr]] ("war"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD194"/&gt;), [[Róta]], and Skuld—the last of the three he refers to as "the youngest [[norns|norn]]"—"always ride to choose the slain and decide the outcome of battle".&lt;ref name="BYOCK44-45"&gt;Byock (2005:44–45).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 49, High describes that when Odin and his wife [[Frigg]] arrived at the funeral of their slain son [[Baldr]], with them came the valkyries and also [[Hugin and Munin|Odin's ravens]].&lt;ref name="BYOCK67"&gt;Byock (2005:67).&lt;/ref&gt;

References to valkyries appear throughout the book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', which provides information about skaldic poetry. In chapter 2, a quote is given from the work ''[[Húsdrápa]]'' by the 10th century skald [[Úlfr Uggason]]. In the poem, Úlfr describes mythological scenes depicted in a newly built hall, including valkyries and ravens accompanying Odin at Baldr's funeral feast:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:There I perceive valkyries and ravens,
:accompanying the wise victory-tree [Odin]
:to the drink of the holy offering [Baldr's funeral feast]
:Within have appeared these motifs.&lt;ref name="FAULKES68"&gt;Faulkes (1995:68).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Further in chapter 2, a quote from the anonymous 10th century poem ''[[Eiríksmál]]'' is provided (see the ''Fagrskinna'' section below for more detail about the poem and another translation):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:What sort of dream is that, Odin?
:I dreamed I rose up before dawn
:to clear up Val-hall for slain people.
:I aroused the Einheriar,
:bade them get up to strew the benches,
:clean the beer-cups,
:the valkyries to serve wine
:for the arrival of a prince.&lt;ref name="FAULKES69"&gt;Faulkes (1995:69).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In chapter 31, poetic terms for referring to a woman are given, including "[a] woman is also referred to in terms of all Asyniur or valkyries or norns or ''dísir''".&lt;ref name="FAULKES94"&gt;Faulkes (1995:94).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 41, while the hero [[Sigurd]] is riding his horse [[Grani]], he encounters a building on a mountain. Within this building Sigurd finds a sleeping woman wearing a helmet and a [[Mail (armour)|coat of mail]]. Sigurd cuts the mail from her, and she awakes. She tells him her name is Hildr, and "she is known as [[Brynhildr]], and was a valkyrie".&lt;ref name="FAULKES102"&gt;Faulkes (1995:102).&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 48, poetic terms for "battle" include "weather of weapons or shields, or of Odin or valkyrie or war-kings or their clash or noise", followed by examples of compositions by various [[skald]]s that have used the name of valkyries in said manner ([[Þorbjörn Hornklofi]] uses "Skögul's din" for "battlefield", [[Bersi Skáldtorfuson]] uses "Gunnr's fire" for "sword" and "Hlökk's snow" for "battle", [[Einarr Skúlason]] uses "Hildr's sail" for "shield" and "Göndul's crushing wind" for "battle" and [[Einarr Helgason|Einarr skálaglamm]] uses "Göndul's din"). Chapter 49 gives similar information when referring to weapons and armor (though the term "death-maidens"—Old Norse ''valmeyjar''—instead of "valkyries" is used here), with further examples.&lt;ref name="FAULKES117-119"&gt;Faulkes (1995:117–119).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 57, within a list of names of [[ásynjur]] (and after alternate names for the goddess [[Freyja]] are provided), a further section contains a list of "Odin's maids"; valkyries: Hildr, Göndul, Hlökk, Mist, Skögul. And then an additional four names; Hrund, [[Eir]], Hrist and Skuld. The section adds that "they are called norns who shape necessity".&lt;ref name="FAULKES157"&gt;Faulkes (1995:157).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some manuscripts of the feature ''[[Nafnaþulur]]'' section of ''Skáldskaparmál'' contain an extended list of 29 valkyrie names (listed as the "valkyries of [[List of names of Odin|Viðrir]]"—a name of Odin). The first stanza lists: Hrist, Mist, Herja, Hlökk, Geiravör, Göll, Hjörþrimul, Guðr, Herfjötra, Skuld, Geirönul, Skögul and Randgníð. The second stanza lists: Ráðgríðr, Göndul, Svipul, Geirskögul, Hildr, Skeggöld, Hrund, Geirdriful, Randgríðr, Þrúðr, Reginleif, Sveið, Þögn, Hjalmþrimul, Þrima and Skalmöld.&lt;ref name="JÓNSSON678"&gt;Jónsson (1973:678).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hrafnsmál''===
[[File:Valkyrie and raven.jpg|thumb|A valkyrie speaks with a raven in a wood-engraving by [[Joseph Swain (engraver)|Joseph Swain]] after [[Frederick Sandys]], 1862]]
The fragmentary skaldic poem ''[[Hrafnsmál]]'' (generally accepted as authored by 9th century Norwegian skald [[Þorbjörn Hornklofi]]) features a conversation between a valkyrie and a raven, largely consisting of the life and deeds of [[Harald I of Norway]]. The poem begins with a request for silence among noblemen so that the skald may tell the deeds of Harald Fairhair. The narrator states that they once overheard a "high-minded", "golden-haired" and "white-armed" maiden speaking with a "glossy-beaked raven". The valkyrie considers herself wise, understands the speech of birds, is further described as having a white-throat and sparkling eyes, and she takes no pleasure in men:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Wise thought her the valkyrie; were welcome never
:men to the bright-eyed one, her who the birds' speech knew well.
: Greeted the light-lashed maiden, the lily-throated woman,
:The [[ymir|hymir]]'s-skull-cleaver as on cliff he was perching.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The valkyrie, previously described as fair and beautiful, then speaks to the gore-drenched and corpse-reeking raven:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:"How is it, ye ravens—whence are ye come now
:with beaks all gory, at break of morning?
:Carrion-reek ye carry, and your claws are bloody.
:Were ye near, at night-time, where ye knew of corpses?"&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER54"&gt;Hollander (1980:54).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The black raven shakes himself, and he responds that he and the rest of the ravens have followed Harald since hatching from their eggs. The raven expresses surprise that the valkyrie seems unfamiliar with the deeds of Harald, and tells her about his deeds for several stanzas. At stanza 15, a question and answer format begins where the valkyrie asks the raven a question regarding Harald, and the raven responds in turn. This continues until the poem ends abruptly.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER54-57"&gt;Hollander (1980:54–57).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Njáls saga''===
[[File:Henry De Groux001.jpg|thumb|''Ride of the Valkyries'' (around 1890) by [[Henry De Groux]]]]
In chapter 157 of ''[[Njáls saga]]'', a man named Dörruð witnesses 12 people riding together to a stone hut on [[Good Friday]] in [[Caithness]]. The 12 go into the hut and Dörruð can no longer see them. Dörruð goes to the hut, and looks through a chink in the wall. He sees that there are women within, and that they have set up a particular [[loom]]; the heads of men are the weights, the entrails of men are the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[weft]], a sword is the [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]], and the [[reel]]s are composed of arrows. The women sing a song called ''[[Darraðarljóð]]'', which Dörruð memorizes.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER66"&gt;Hollander (1980:66).&lt;/ref&gt;

The song consists of 11 stanzas, and within it the valkyries weave and choose who is to be slain at the [[Battle of Clontarf]] (fought outside [[Dublin]] in 1014 [[Common Era|CE]]). Of the 12 valkyries weaving, six have their names given in the song: Hildr, [[Hjörþrimul]], [[Sanngriðr]], [[Svipul]], [[Guðr]] and Göndul. Stanza 9 of the song reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Now awful it is to be without,
:as blood-red rack races overhead;
:is the welkin gory with warriors' blood
:as we valkyries war-songs chanted.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER68"&gt;Hollander (1980:68).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
At the end of the poem, the valkyries sing "start we swiftly with steeds unsaddled—hence to battle with brandished swords!"&lt;ref name=HOLLANDER68/&gt; The prose narrative picks up again, and says that the valkyries tear their loom down and into pieces. Each valkyrie holds on to what she has in her hands. Dörruð leaves the chink in the wall and heads home, and the women mount their horses and ride away; six to the south and six to the north.&lt;ref name=HOLLANDER66/&gt;

===''Heimskringla''===
[[File:The Valkyrie's Vigil.jpg|thumb|''The Valkyrie's Vigil'' (1906) by [[Edward Robert Hughes]]]]
At the end of the ''[[Heimskringla]]'' saga ''[[Hákonar saga góða]]'', the poem ''[[Hákonarmál]]'' by the 10th century [[skald]] [[Eyvindr skáldaspillir]] is presented. The saga relates that king [[Haakon I of Norway]] died in battle, and although he is Christian, he requests that since he has died "among heathens, then give me such burial place as seems most fitting to you". The saga relates that shortly after Haakon died on the same slab of rock that he was born upon, he was greatly mourned by friend and foe alike, and that his friends moved his body northward to Sæheim in North [[Hordaland]]. Haakon was buried there in a large burial mound in full armour and his finest clothing, yet with no other valuables. Further, "words were spoken over his grave according to the custom of heathen men, and they put him on the way to Valhalla". The poem ''Hákonarmál'' is then provided.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER124-125"&gt;Hollander (2007:124–125).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Hákonarmál'', Odin sends forth the two valkyries Göndul and Skögul to "choose among the kings' kinsmen" and who in battle should dwell with Odin in Valhalla. A battle rages with great slaughter, and part of the description employs the [[kenning]] "Skögul's-stormblast" for "battle". Haakon and his men die in battle, and they see the valkyrie Göndul leaning on a spear shaft. Göndul comments that "groweth now the gods' following, since Hákon has been with host so goodly bidden home with holy godheads". Haakon hears "what the valkyries said", and the valkyries are described as sitting "high-hearted on horseback", wearing helmets, carrying shields and that the horses wisely bore them.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER125"&gt;Hollander (2007:125).&lt;/ref&gt; A brief exchange follows between Haakon and the valkyrie Skögul:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:''Hákon said:''
:"Why didst Geirskogul grudge us victory?
:though worthy we were for the gods to grant it?"
:''Skogul said:''
:"'Tis owing to us that the issue was won
: and your foemen fled."&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER126"&gt;Hollander (2007:126).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Skögul says that they shall now ride forth to the "green homes of the godheads" to tell Odin the king will come to Valhalla. The poem continues, and Haakon becomes a part of the einherjar in Valhalla, awaiting to do battle with the monstrous wolf [[Fenrir]].&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER126-127"&gt;Hollander (2007:126–127).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fagrskinna''===
[[File:Heimdallr and valkyries by Frølich.jpg|thumb|An illustration of valkyries encountering the god [[Heimdallr]] as they carry a dead man to Valhalla (1906) by [[Lorenz Frølich]]]]
[[File:Walhall by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|''Valhalla'' (1905) by Emil Doepler]]
In chapter 8 of ''[[Fagrskinna]]'', a prose narrative states that, after the death of her husband [[Eric Bloodaxe]], [[Gunnhild Mother of Kings]] had a poem composed about him. The composition is by an anonymous author from the 10th century and is referred to as ''[[Eiríksmál]]''. It describes Eric Bloodaxe and five other kings arriving in Valhalla after their death. The poem begins with comments by Odin (as Old Norse ''Óðinn''):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'What kind of a dream is it,' said Óðinn,
:in which just before daybreak,
:I thought I cleared Valhǫll,
:for coming of slain men?
:I waked the Einherjar,
:bade valkyries rise up,
:to strew the bench,
:and scour the beakers,

:wine to carry,
:as for a king's coming,
:here to me I expect
:heroes' coming from the world,
:certain great ones,
:so glad is my heart.&lt;ref name="FINLAY58"&gt;Finlay (2004:58).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The god [[Bragi]] asks where a thundering sound is coming from, and says that the benches of Valhalla are creaking—as if the god Baldr had returned to Valhalla—and that it sounds like the movement of a thousand. Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes [[Sigmund]] and [[Sinfjötli]] to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.&lt;ref name="FINLAY59"&gt;Finlay (2004:59).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ragnhild Tregagás charm===
A [[Witch-hunt|witchcraft trial]] held in 1324 in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]], records a spell used by the accused [[Ragnhild Tregagás]] to end the marriage of her former lover, a man named Bárd. The charm contains a mention of the valkyrie [[Göndul]] being "sent out":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:I send out from me the spirits of (the valkyrie) Gondul.
:May the first bite you in the back.
:May the second bite you in the breast.
:May the third turn hate and envy upon you.&lt;ref name="MACLEOD37"&gt;MacLeod (2006:37).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Old English attestations==
[[File:Sermo Lupi.jpg|thumb|A page from {{lang|la|[[Sermo Lupi ad Anglos]]}}]]
The Old English {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} and {{lang|ang|wælcyrie}} appear several times in Old English manuscripts, generally to translate foreign concepts into Old English. In the sermon {{lang|la|[[Sermo Lupi ad Anglos]]}}, written by [[Wulfstan II]], {{lang|ang|wælcyrie}} is used, and considered to appear as word for a human "sorceress".&lt;ref name="NORTH106"&gt;North (1997:106).&lt;/ref&gt; An early 11th-century manuscript of Aldhelm's {{lang|la|De laudis virginitatis}} (Oxford, Bodleian library, Digby 146) [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] {{lang|la|ueneris}} with {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} (with {{lang|ang|gydene}} meaning "goddess"). {{lang|ang|Wælcyrge}} is used to translate the names of the [[Classical mythology|classical]] [[Erinyes|furies]] in two manuscripts ([[Cotton Cleopatra]] A. iii, and the older ''Corpus Glossary''). In the manuscript Cotton Cleopatra A. iii, {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} is also used to gloss the [[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]]. A description of a raven flying over the Egyptian army appears as {{lang|ang|wonn wælceaseg}} (meaning "dark one choosing the slain"). Scholarly theories debate whether these attestations point to an indigenous belief among the Anglo-Saxons shared with the Norse, or if they were a result of later Norse influence (see section below).&lt;ref name="NORTH106"/&gt;

==Archaeological record==

===Female figures and cup and horn-bearers===
[[File:Valkyrie on horse and giving valkyrie.jpg|thumb|Viking Age jewellery thought to depict valkyries. On the left of the photograph is a female mounted on horseback with a 'winged' cavalry spear clamped under her leg and a sword in her hand. The mounted female is being greeted by another female figure who is carrying a shield. On the right of the photograph is one of numerous female silver figures usually described in museums and books as valkyries (right)]]
[[Viking Age]] stylized silver amulets depicting women wearing long gowns, their hair pulled back and knotted into a ponytail, sometimes bearing [[drinking horn]]s, have been discovered throughout Scandinavia. These figures are commonly considered to represent valkyries or dísir.&lt;ref name="SILVERFIGURES"&gt;Orchard (1997:172) and Lindow (2001:96).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the amulets appear in Viking Age graves, and were presumably placed there because "they were thought to have protective powers".&lt;ref name="MACLEOD37"/&gt;

The [[Tjängvide image stone]] from the Baltic island of [[Gotland]], Sweden features a rider on an eight-legged horse, which may be Odin's eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]], being greeted by a female, which may be a valkyrie at Valhalla.&lt;ref name="LINDOW276"&gt;Lindow (2001:276).&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th century [[runestone]] [[Sigurd stones#U 1163|U 1163]] features a carving of a female bearing a horn that has been interpreted as the valkyrie Sigrdrífa handing the hero Sigurd (also depicted on the stone) a drinking horn.&lt;ref name="WESSEN621"&gt;Wessén &amp; Jansson (1953–58:621).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a small figure dated at around 800 AD was discovered in [[Hårby]], [[Denmark]] by three amateur archaeologists. The figurine portrays a woman with long hair knotted into a ponytail who is wearing a long dress which is sleeveless and vest like at the top. Over the top of her dress she is wearing an embroidered apron. Her clothing keeps the woman's arms unobstructed so she can fight with the sword and shield she is holding. Commenting on the figure, archaeologist Mogens Bo Henriksen said that "there can hardly be any doubt that the figure depicts one of Odin's valkyries as we know them from the sagas as well as from Swedish picture stones from the time around AD700".&lt;ref name="KENNEDY-2013"&gt;Kennedy (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Runic inscriptions===
[[File:Rökstenen.jpg|thumb|The [[Rök Runestone]]]]
Specific valkyries are mentioned on two [[runestones]]; the early 9th century [[Rök Runestone]] in [[Östergötland]], [[Sweden]], and the 10th-century [[Karlevi Runestone]] on the island of [[Öland]], [[Sweden]], which mentions the valkyrie [[Þrúðr]].&lt;ref name="MACLEOD37"/&gt; On the Rök Runestone, a [[kenning]] is employed that involves a valkyrie riding a wolf as her steed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:That we tell the twelfth, where the horse of the Valkyrie [literally "the horse of [[Gunnr]]"] sees food on the battlefield, where twenty kings are lying.&lt;ref name="ANDRÉN11"&gt;Andrén (2006:11).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the [[Bryggen inscriptions]] found in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]], is the "valkyrie stick" from the late 14th century. The stick features a [[Runic alphabet|runic inscription]] intended as a charm. The inscription says that "I cut cure-runes", and also "help-runes", once against [[elf|elves]], twice against [[trolls]], thrice against [[jötunn|thurs]] and then a mention of a valkyrie occurs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Against the harmful ''skag''-valkyrie,
:so that she never shall, though she never would –
:evil woman! – injure (?) your life.&lt;ref name="MACLEOD34-35"&gt;MacLeod (2006:34–35).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is followed by "I send you, I look at you, wolfish perversion, and unbearable desire, may distress descend on you and ''jöluns'' wrath. Never shall you sit, never shall you sleep ... (that you) love me as yourself." According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the inscription "seems to begin as a benevolent formulation before abruptly switching to the infliction of distress and misery, presumably upon the recipient of the charm rather than the baleful valkyrie", and they posit the final line appears "to constitute a rather spiteful kind of charm aimed at securing the love of a woman".&lt;ref name="MACLEOD34-37"&gt;MacLeod (2006:34–37).&lt;/ref&gt;

MacLeod and Mees state that the opening lines of the charm correspond to the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''Sigrdrífumál'', where the valkyrie Sigrdrífa provides runic advice, and that the meaning of the term ''skag'' is unclear, but a cognate exists in ''Helgakviða Hundingsbana I'' where Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been a "''skass''-valkyrie". MacLeod and Mees believe the word means something like "supernatural sending", and that this points to a connection to the Ragnhild Tregagás charm, where a valkyrie is also "sent forth".&lt;ref name=MACLEOD34-37/&gt;

==Valkyrie names==
{{main|List of valkyrie names}}
The Old Norse poems ''[[Völuspá]]'', ''[[Grímnismál]]'', ''[[Darraðarljóð]]'' and the ''[[Nafnaþulur]]'' section of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', provide lists of valkyrie names. In addition, some valkyrie names appear solely outside of these lists, such as ''[[Sigrún]]'' (who is attested in the poems ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana I]]'' and ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]''). Many valkyrie names emphasize associations with battle and, in many cases, on the spear—a weapon heavily associated with the god Odin.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON96"&gt;Davidson (1988:96).&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars propose that the names of the valkyries themselves contain no individuality, but are rather descriptive of the traits and nature of war-goddesses, and are possibly the descriptive creations of [[skalds]].&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON+SIMEK"&gt;Examples include Davidson (1988:96–97) and Simek (2007:349).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some valkyrie names may be descriptive of the roles and abilities of the valkyries. The valkyrie name ''[[Herja]]'' has been theorised as pointing to a connection to the name of the goddess ''[[Hariasa]]'', who is attested from a stone from 187 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref name="SIMEK143AND131"&gt;Simek (2007:143). For Hariasa, Simek (2007:131).&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''[[Herfjötur]]'' has been theorised as pointing to the ability of the valkyries to place fetters.&lt;ref name="SIMEK142"&gt;Simek (2007:142).&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''[[Svipul]]'' may be descriptive of the influence the valkyries have over [[wyrd|wyrd or ørlog]]—a [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] concept of [[Destiny|fate]].&lt;ref name="SIMEK308"&gt;Simek (2007:308).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Old English {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} and Old English charms===
[[File:Sutton Hoo Burial Mound.jpg|thumb|An Anglo-Saxon [[tumulus|burial mound]] at [[Sutton Hoo]] in [[Suffolk]], [[England]]]]
Richard North says that the description of a raven flying over the [[Egypt]]ian army (glossed as {{lang|ang|wonn wælceaseg}}) may have been directly influenced by the Old Norse concept of Valhalla, the usage of {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} in {{lang|la|De laudibus virginitatis}} may represent a loan or loan-translation of Old Norse {{lang|non|valkyrja}}, but the Cotton Cleopatra A. iii and the ''Corpus Glossary'' instances "appear to show an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] conception of {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} that was independent of contemporary [[Scandinavia]]n influence".&lt;ref name=NORTH106/&gt;

Two [[Old English literature|Old English]] charms mention figures that are theorised as representing an Anglo-Saxon notion of valkyries or valkyrie-like female beings; {{lang|ang|[[Wið færstice]]}}, a charm to cure a sudden pain or stitch, and ''[[For a Swarm of Bees]]'', a charm to keep [[honey bee]]s from [[swarming (honey bee)|swarming]]. In {{lang|ang|Wið færstice}}, a sudden pain is attributed to a small, "shrieking" spear thrown with supernatural strength ({{lang|ang|mægen}}) by "fierce" loudly flying "mighty women" ({{lang|ang|mihtigan wif}}) who have ridden over a burial mound:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;They were loud, yes, loud,
when they rode over the (burial) mound;
they were fierce when they rode across the land.
Shield yourself now, you can survive this strife.
Out, little spear, if there is one here within.
It stood under/behind lime-wood (i.e. a shield), under a light-coloured/light-weight shield,
where those mighty women marshalled their powers, and they send shrieking spears.&lt;ref name="HALL1-2"&gt;Hall (2007:1–2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Theories have been proposed that these figures are connected to valkyries.&lt;ref name="GREENFIELD257"&gt;Greenfield (1996:257).&lt;/ref&gt; Richard North says that "though it is not clear what the poet takes these women to be, their female sex, riding in flight and throwing spears suggest that they were imagined in England as a female being analogous to the later Norse {{lang|non|valkyrjur}}."&lt;ref name="NORTH105"&gt;North (1997:105).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] theorizes that {{lang|ang|Wið færstice}} was originally a battle spell that had, over time, been reduced to evoke "a prosaic stitch in the side".&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON63"&gt;Davidson (1990:63).&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of ''For a Swarm of Bees'', the swarming bees are referred to as "victory-women" (Old English {{lang|ang|sigewif}}):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Settle down, victory-women,
never be wild and fly to the woods.
Be as mindful of my welfare,
as is each man of eating and of home.&lt;ref name="GREENFIELD256"&gt;Greenfield (1996:256).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "victory women" has been theorised as pointing to an association with valkyries. This theory is not universally accepted, and the reference has also been theorised as a simple metaphor for the "victorious sword" (the stinging) of the bees.&lt;ref name=GREENFIELD256/&gt;

===Merseburg Incantation, fetters, {{lang|non|dísir}}, {{lang|non|idisi}} and norns===
[[File:Idise by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|''Idise'' (1905) by Emil Doepler]]
[[File:The Dises by Hardy.jpg|thumb|''The Dises'' (1909) by [[Dorothy Hardy]]]]

One of the two [[Old High German]] [[Merseburg Incantations]] call upon female beings—''[[Idisi]]''—to bind and hamper an army. The incantation reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Once the Idisi sat, sat here and there,
some bound fetters, some hampered the army,
some untied fetters:
Escape from the fetters, flee from the enemies.&lt;ref name="SIMEK171"&gt;Simek (2007:171).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Idisi'' mentioned in the incantation are generally considered to be valkyries. Rudolf Simek says that "these Idisi are obviously a kind of valkyrie, as these also have the power to hamper enemies in Norse mythology" and points to a connection with the valkyrie name {{lang|non|[[Herfjötur]]}} (Old Norse "army-fetter").&lt;ref name=SIMEK171/&gt; Hilda R. Davidson compares the incantation to the Old English {{lang|ang|Wið færstice}} charm and theorises a similar role for them both.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSON63/&gt;

Simek says that the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] term ''Idisi'' ({{lang-osx|idis}}, {{lang-goh|itis}}, {{lang-ang|ides}}) refers to a "dignified, well respected woman (married or unmarried), possibly a term for any woman, and therefore glosses exactly Latin {{lang|la|[[matres and Matrones|matrona]]}}" and that a link to the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] term {{lang|non|dísir}} is reasonable to assume, yet not undisputed. In addition, the place name [[Idistaviso|Idisiaviso]] (meaning "plain of the Idisi") where forces commanded by [[Arminius]] fought those commanded by [[Germanicus]] at the [[Battle of the Weser River]] in 16 AD. Simek points to a connection between the name ''Idisiaviso'', the role of the Idisi in one of the two Merseburg Incantations and valkyries.&lt;ref name="SIMEK171"/&gt;

Regarding the {{lang|non|dísir}}, Simek states that Old Norse {{lang|non|dís}} appears commonly as simply a term for "woman", just as Old High German {{lang|goh|itis}}, Old Saxon {{lang|osx|idis}} and Old English {{lang|ang|ides}}, and may have also been used to denote a type of goddess. According to Simek, "several of the Eddic sources might lead us to conclude that the {{lang|non|dísir}} were valkyrie-like guardians of the dead, and indeed in {{lang|non|[[Guðrúnarkviða]]}} I 19 the valkyries are even called {{lang|non|Herjans dísir}} "Odin's {{lang|non|dísir}}". The {{lang|non|dísir}} are explicitly called dead women in {{lang|non|[[Atlamál]]}} 28 and a secondary belief that the {{lang|non|dísir}} were the souls of dead women (see {{lang|non|[[fylgja|fylgjur]]}}) also underlies the {{lang|non|[[landdísir]]}} of [[Scandinavian folklore|Icelandic folklore]].&lt;ref name="SIMEK61-62"&gt;Simek (2007:61–62).&lt;/ref&gt; Simek says that "as the function of the [[Matres and Matrones|matrons]] was also extremely varied—fertility goddess, personal guardians, but also warrior-goddesses—the belief in the {{lang|non|dísir}}, like the belief in the valkyries, norns and matrons, may be considered to be different manifestations of a belief in a number of female (half-?) goddesses."&lt;ref name=SIMEK61-62/&gt;

[[Jacob Grimm]] states that, though the norns and valkyries are similar in nature, there is a fundamental difference between the two. Grimm states that a {{lang|non|dís}} can be both norn and a valkyrie, "but their functions are separate and usually the persons. The norns have to pronounce the fatum [fate], they sit on their chairs, or they roam through the country among mortals, fastening their threads. Nowhere is it said that they ride. The valkyrs ''ride'' to war, decide the issues of fighting, and conduct the fallen to heaven; their riding is like that of heroes and gods".&lt;ref name="GRIMM421"&gt;Grimm (1882:421).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins and development===
[[File:Die Nornen (1889) by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Norns'' (1889) by [[Johannes Gehrts]]]]

Various theories have been proposed about the origins and development of the valkyries from Germanic paganism to later Norse mythology. Rudolf Simek suggests valkyries were probably originally viewed as "demons of the dead to whom warriors slain on the battlefield belonged", and that a shift in interpretation of the valkyries may have occurred "when the concept of Valhalla changed from a battlefield to a warrior's paradise". Simek says that this original concept was "superseded by the [[Shieldmaiden|shield girls]]—Irish female warriors who lived on like the ''einherjar'' in Valhall." Simek says that the valkyries were closely associated with Odin, and that this connection existed in an earlier role as "demons of death". Simek states that due to the shift of concept, the valkyries became popular figures in [[Poetic Edda#Heroic lays|heroic poetry]], and during this transition were stripped of their "demonic characteristics and became more human, and therefore become capable of falling in love with mortals [...]." Simek says that the majority of the names of the valkyries point to a warlike function, that most of [[List of valkyrie names in Norse mythology|valkyrie names]] do not appear to be very old, and that the names "mostly come from poetic creativity rather than from real folk-belief."&lt;ref name="SIMEK349"/&gt;

MacLeod and Mees theorise that "the role of the corpse-choosing valkyries became increasingly confused in later Norse mythology with that of the [[Norns]], the supernatural females responsible for determining human destiny [...]."&lt;ref name="MACLEOD39"&gt;MacLeod (2006:39).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] says that, regarding valkyries, "evidently an elaborate literary picture has been built up by generations of poets and storytellers, in which several conceptions can be discerned. We recognise something akin to Norns, spirits who decide destinies of men; to the [[Völva|seeresses]], who could protect men in battle with their spells; to the powerful female guardian spirits attached to certain families, bringing luck to youth under their protection; even to certain women who armed themselves and fought like men, for whom there is some historical evidence from the regions round the [[Black Sea]]". She adds that there may also be a memory in this of a "priestess of the god of war, women who officiated at the sacrificial rites when captives were put to death after battle."&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON61"&gt;Davidson (1990:61).&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson places emphasis on the fact that ''valkyrie'' literally means "chooser of the slain". She compares Wulfstan's mention of a "chooser of the slain" in his ''Sermo Lupi ad Anglos'' sermon, which appears among "a blacklist of sinners, witches and evildoers", to "all the other classes whom he [Wulfstan] mentions", and concludes as those "are human ones, it seems unlikely that he has introduced mythological figures as well." Davidson points out that [[Arab]] traveller [[Ibn Fadlan]]'s detailed account of a 10th-century [[Rus' (people)|Rus]] ship funeral on the [[Volga River]] features an "old [[Huns|Hunnish]] woman, massive and grim to look upon" (who Fadlan refers to as the "Angel of Death") who organises the killing of the slave girl, and has two other women with her that Fadlan refers to as her daughters. Davidson says that "it would hardly be surprising if strange legends grew up about such women, who must have been kept apart from their kind due to their gruesome duties. Since it was often decided by lot which prisoners should be killed, the idea that the god "chose" his victims, through the instrument of the priestesses, must have been a familiar one, apart from the obvious assumption that some were chosen to fall in war." Davidson says that it appears that from "early times" the [[Germanic peoples]] "believed in fierce female spirits doing the command of the war god, stirring up disorder, taking part in battle, seizing and perhaps devouring the slain."&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON61-62"&gt;Davidson (1990:61–62).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freyja and Fólkvangr===
[[File:Freya by C. E. Doepler.jpg|thumb|left|''Freya'' (1882) by [[Carl Emil Doepler]]]]
The goddess [[Freyja]] and her afterlife field [[Fólkvangr]], where she receives half of the slain, has been theorized as connected to the valkyries. Britt-Mari Näsström points out the description in ''Gylfaginning'' where it is said of Freyja "whenever she rides into battle she takes half of the slain", and interprets ''Fólkvangr'' as "the field of the Warriors". Näsström notes that, just like Odin, Freyja receives slain heroes who have died on the battlefield, and that her house is [[Sessrumnir]] (which she translates as "filled with many seats"), a dwelling that Näsström posits likely fills the same function as Valhalla. Näsström comments that "still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse view of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn and the other to Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'."&lt;ref name="NÄSSTRÖM61"&gt;Näsström (1999:61).&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegfried Andres Dobat comments that "in her mythological role as the chooser of half the fallen warriors for her death realm Fólkvangr, the goddess Freyja, however, emerges as the mythological role model for the Valkyrjar {{Sic}} and the dísir."&lt;ref name="DOBAT186"&gt;Dobat (2006:186).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''View of Arles, Flowering Orchards''''' is a painting by [[Vincent van Gogh]], executed in spring 1889, one of several paintings he produced in his  [[Flowering Orchards (Van Gogh series)|''Flowering Orchards'' series]] while living in [[Arles]].  

==Description==
It supplies a view across a canal and the poplars on its board towards the historical center of Arles, with the towers of [[Church of St. Trophime|Saint-Trophime]] and College St Charles to the left, contrasted by recent building of the Caserne Calvin, housing the [[Zouave]] Regiment, to the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Décoration: Vincent van Gogh's Werkreihe für das Gelbe Haus in Arles | author=Dorn, R | publisher=Georg Olms Verlag | location=Hildesheim, Zürich &amp; New York | year=1990 | pages=469–470| isbn=3-487-09098-8 | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh was acquainted with several of the Zouave officers, painted one in native uniform, and his portrait of Lieutenant Milliet is known as The Lover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-12-23|title=Portraits by Vincent van Gogh|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portraits_by_Vincent_van_Gogh&amp;oldid=756285498|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poplar trees still stand along the canal, today, but the orchards and the Caserne are gone.
