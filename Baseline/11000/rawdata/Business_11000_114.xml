      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2946">A ''99-year lease'' was, under historic [[common law]], the longest possible term of a [[lease]] of [[real property]].  It is no longer the law in most common law [[jurisdiction]]s today, yet 99-year leases continue to be common as a matter of business practice and [[conventional wisdom]].

==The law==
Under the traditional [[Law of the United States|American common law]] doctrine, the 99-year term was not literal, but merely an arbitrary time span beyond the life expectancy of any possible [[lessee]] or [[Lease|lessor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/wiki/99_Year_Lease.asp Mortgage News Daily web site article on a 99-year lease].  Accessed 20 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Adams, ''Why are leases made for 99-year terms?'', 22 July 1977, found at [http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_138.html The Straight Dope article on 99-year lease]. Accessed 20 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Blackstone]] states that a lease was formerly limited to 40 years, although much longer leases (for 300 years, or 1000 years) were in use by the time of [[Edward III]].&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone (1753), ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', Book 2, Chapter IX "Of estates less than freehold"&lt;/ref&gt; The 40-year limit was based on the unreliable text "[[The Mirror of Justices]]" (book 2, chapter 27).

In the law of several US states, a 99-year lease will always be the longest possible contract for realty by [[statute]], but many have enacted shorter terms and some allow infinite terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jk9.com/99_lease.htm Law Office of James Kaklamanos web site page on 99-year lease].  Accessed 20 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the influence of the ideas of [[Henry George]] at the time the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) was established in the early 20th century, all land in the ACT is held under 99-year leases, the first of which will expire in 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Gordon |title=Can people own land in the ACT? |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/specials/curious-canberra/2016-07-04/can-people-own-land-in-the-act/7550166 |accessdate=2018-07-24 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 99-year lease concept has been more common under the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[regime]]s when it comes to [[Concession (territory)|concessions of territory]]: most concessions last for 99 years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

'''Allegany Ballistics Laboratory''' ('''ABL''') located in [[Rocket Center, West Virginia]], is a diverse [[factory|industrial complex]] employing some 1,000 people across {{convert|1628|acre|km2}}.  The facility is a member of the [[Federal Laboratory Consortium]] and is operated by [[Alliant Techsystems]] (ATK) under contract with the [[Naval Sea Systems Command]] (NAVSEA). 

== Current operation ==

The ABL facility is a manufacturer of advanced [[composite materials|composite structures]] for the [[F-22 Raptor]] and other aerospace projects. ATK also operates 6 of 11 known [[advanced fiber placement|advanced fiber placement machines]]. In addition the site produces about 80 military products, including: [[30 mm caliber|30mm shells]] for [[AH-64 Apache|Apache helicopters]], [[training grenades]], [[Proximity fuze|fuze-proximity sensors]], [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] and [[warhead]]s, and [[tank ammunition]]. 

Also on the site is the Robert C. Byrd Hilltop Office Complex and the [[Robert C. Byrd Institute]] for Advanced Flexible Manufacturing.  At the Robert C. Byrd Complex on the hill companies have rented space to do secure research, among them [[IBM]] (which recently acquired [https://web.archive.org/web/20120107084722/http://www.nisc-llc.com/ National Interest Security Company]) who is digitizing data on hurricane cleanup, [[avian influenza]], and weather records.

== History ==

ABL was established in 1944 on the site of a former ammunitions plant on land owned by the Army. After World War II, the plant was transferred to the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] and was involved in building propulsion devices and engines for the solid-rocket industry.   

Later in the decade, ownership of ABL was transferred to the Navy office of [[Naval Sea Systems Command]]. Since 1946 it was operated by the [[Hercules Powder Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/missilesrockets8919unse#page/n325/mode/2up ''Missiles and Rockets''], May 29, 1961, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 when it was producing [[Altair (rocket stage)|Altair]] rocket stages for [[Vanguard rocket]]s, ABL was, "A subsidiary of the Navy operated by the Hercules Powder Company."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seds.org/archive/spaceviews/9712/articles3.html |title=Vanguard: America's Answer to Sputnik |last=LePage |first=Andrew J. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808190710/http://www.seds.org/archive/spaceviews/9712/articles3.html |archivedate=2009-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy now contracts out operation of the facility to [[Alliant Techsystems|ATK (Alliant Techsystems)]], a $3.4 billion corporation based in [[Edina, Minnesota]].

In 1998, ATK's Conventional Munitions Group was selected by [[Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems]] to produce the fiber-placed composite pivot shaft assembly for the [[F-22 Raptor]] air-dominance fighter.  Work on the production program was performed at Alliant's automated fiber placement production facility at the Allegany Ballistics Laboratory before the production of F-22 aircraft ended in 2012.  The fiber placement facility was constructed as part of a $177 million renovation and restoration program funded by the U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), which owns the Allegany Ballistics Laboratory. &lt;ref&gt;[http://atk.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=165 Alliant Techsystems Selected by Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems to Produce Composite Pivot Shaft for F-22 Fighter]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local Perception ==


As for the ecological impact, it is believed the facility contributes greatly to the pollution of the adjacent [[North Branch Potomac River]]. While this is unsupported, the company does have numerous runoff sites.{{fact|date=November 2018}} Also, the groundwater in the surrounding community has been verified to contain many contaminants, although actions have since been taken to reduce these contaminants, and are part of a constant monitoring process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/reg3hwmd/npl/WV0170023691.htm West Virginia, Allegany Ballistics Laboratory (US Navy) Site, Current Site Information (NPL Pad) | Mid-Atlantic Superfund | US EPA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511101757/http://epa.gov/reg3hwmd/npl/WV0170023691.htm |date=2009-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business Park Skejby''' is a large [[business park]] in the northern district of [[Aarhus N]], in the city of Aarhus, Denmark. 

Business Park Skejby was officially created in 2013 and stretches north from the neighbourhood of Christiansbjerg to Skejby and is bounded by the major roads of [[Ring 2 (Aarhus)|Ring 2]] and [[Randersvej]].&lt;ref&gt;BSP: [http://businessparkskejby.dk/Om-BPS.aspx A map of Business Park Skejby]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the businesses and institutions within the park area were constructed several decades ago.

==Description==
Apart from small and large businesses, the business park area is also home to the smaller business park of Agro Food Park, a large number of educational facilities and a few residential areas as well. Major institutions, most of which predates 2013, includes:

* [[Aarhus University Hospital|The New University Hospital]] (DNU)
* [[NRGi]] headquarters. NRGi is a large Danish coop energy company.&lt;ref&gt;NRGi: [http://nrgiinfo.dk/nrgiinfo/om-nrgi/om-nrgi/nrgi-huset/ NRGi-huset]&lt;/ref&gt;

Landmarks for the area includes ''Aarhus Vandtårn'', a former water tower in red brick with a bright green copper roof, the nature site of [[Vestereng]] - a former military training ground -, and the old village of [[Skejby]] with an old white-washed village church.

Business Park Skejby has its headquarters outside the park in the library and culture centre of [[Dokk1]] at the harbourfront.

== Transportation ==
The business park is located at the outer ring road of [[Ring 2 (Aarhus)|Ring 2]] (Hasle Ringvej) and the intercity motorway of Randersvej, with easy access to all of Aarhus. 

Since December 2017, the business park has been connected to the inner city, including the business park headquarters and the central station, by the [[Aarhus light rail]], an electric tram system.

=== RepTrak model ===
The RepTrak Model is a tool that tracks 23 key performance indicators grouped around 7 reputation dimensions that research has proven to be effective in getting stakeholders to support the company. The beating heart of the RepTrak Model is the Pulse. The RepTrak Pulse measures the health of a company's overall reputation with consumers. The RepTrak Pulse score is based on four statements: the ''esteem'', ''good feeling'', ''trust'', and ''admiration'' that consumers feel towards a company. The results of this study are published world-wide through [[Forbes]].com as well as through local partners in the 27 countries included in the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/05/21/reputation-institute-survey-lead-citizen-cx_sm_0521methodology.html | work=Forbes | title=Company Methodology | date=May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Citilink''' is a [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airline]] headquartered in [[Jakarta]], Indonesia. It was established in 2001 as a low-cost brand of [[Garuda Indonesia]], set up to operate shuttle services between Indonesian cities. Since 30 July 2012, Citilink has officially operated as a separate subsidiary of Garuda Indonesia, operating with its own callsign, airline codes, logo and uniform.&lt;ref name=Spinoff&gt;{{cite web|title=July 30, 2012 – Citilink officially separates from Garuda today|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/07/30/citilink-officially-separates-garuda-today.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409235135/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/07/30/citilink-officially-separates-garuda-today.html|archivedate=April 9, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main hub is [[Juanda International Airport]], [[Surabaya]], [[East Java]].&lt;ref name="FI"&gt;{{cite news | title= Directory: World Airlines | work= [[Flight International]] | page= 66 | date= 2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Citilink Fokker F-28-4000 Fellowship Sim.jpg|thumb|Citilink [[Fokker F28 Fellowship]] in 2003]]
[[File:Citilink Boeing 737-300 MRD-3.jpg|thumb|Citilink [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] at [[Juanda International Airport]] in 2005]]
Garuda Indonesia established Citilink as a low-cost brand in 2001 and operations commenced on 16 July that year with two [[Fokker F28 Fellowship]]s transferred from the mainline fleet. Initial operations were from Surabaya on the island of Java to destinations not served by Garuda Indonesia's mainline fleet: Yogyakarta (also on Java); Balikpapan on the island of Borneo and [[Tarakan, North Kalimantan]], just off Borneo's coast; and Makassar on the island of Sulawesi. By the end of 2001 Garuda had transferred five F28s to Citilink. In 2004 Citilink was serving ten destinations and Garuda began to replace the F28s with [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300s]]. In 2008 Garuda temporarily suspended operations of Citilink, relaunching the brand in January 2009 after replacing the remaining Fokker F28s with more modern aircraft. In July 2010 Citilink operations were being conducted by two Boeing 737-300s and a [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-400]].

===Spinoff and expansion plans===
In May 2011 Garuda announced plans for a spin-off of Citilink. The new business plan was for Citilink to become a separate business entity in the first quarter of 2012 with a full brand overhaul for the airline, including a new livery design; new website; a new cabin interior design and cabin crew uniforms; and new advertising and marketing strategies.&lt;ref name="thejakartapost.com"&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/05/garuda-announces-new-plans-citilink-ahead-spin.html Garuda announces new plans for Citilink ahead of spin-off | The Jakarta Post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
An integral part of this plan was for Citilink to secure 25 new [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320s]] and utilising these new and more economical aircraft to expand into a significant regional low-cost carrier with the anticipation that by 2015, Citilink would contribute 30 percent of Garuda Indonesia's revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/154116|title=25 New Airbus 320s|work=pikiran-rakyat.com|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/154113|title=2015, Citilink Contribute 30% Garuda Indonesia's Revenue|work=pikiran-rakyat.com|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining an [[Air Operator's Certificate]] in August 2012, Citilink had carried 8 million passengers by the end of 2013 and was running at a load factor of 85 percent and an On Time Arrival rate of 87 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ekbis.rmol.co/read/2014/01/15/140001/Citilink-Terbangkan-8-Juta-Penumpang-Sejak-2012- |title=Citilink Terbangkan 8 Juta Penumpang Sejak 2012 |trans-title=Citilink Flies 8 Million Passengers Since 2012 |author=Widya Victoria |date=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015 the airline's fleet consisted of four Boeing 737-300s, four [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-500s]] and thirty-four Airbus A320s.

On 9 August 2011, Garuda Indonesia finalised an order for 25 Airbus A320 aircraft with options for 25 more, making the airline a new customer for the Airbus single aisle aircraft type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/garuda-indonesia-finalises-order-for-25-a320-family-aircraft|title=Garuda Indonesia finalises order for 25 A320 Family aircraft |publisher=Airbus |date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order consisted of 15 Airbus A320s and 10 Airbus A320neos, with five aircraft expected to be delivered each year between 2014 and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pasarmodal.inilah.com/read/detail/1761754/garuda-teken-pembelian-25-pesawat-a320-family |title=Garuda Teken Pembelian 25 Pesawat A320 Family |date=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationnews.eu/2011/08/09/garuda-indonesia-finalises-order-for-25-a320-family-aircraft/citilink-a320neo/ Garuda Indonesia finalises order for 25 A320 Family aircraft Citilink A320neo – INTERNATIONAL AVIATION NEWS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524154655/http://www.aviationnews.eu/2011/08/09/garuda-indonesia-finalises-order-for-25-a320-family-aircraft/citilink-a320neo/ |date=2013-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet upgrade program was valued at around $2.13 billion.

By late 2011, Garuda Indonesia was seeking more used A320s in preparation for the launch of proposed international Citilink services in 2012.&lt;ref name="thejakartapost.com"/&gt; In September 2011 the airline announced plans to introduce four more used A320s to enter into service between October 2011 and February 2012.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In December 2012, Citilink placed an order for 25 [[ATR 72|ATR 72-600s]] with options for 25 more.&lt;ref name="aviationweek1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/awx_12_27_2012_p0-532247.xml&amp;p=1 |title=Indonesia's Citilink Ordering 25 ATR 72-600s |publisher=Aviationweek.com |date=2012-12-27 |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Citilink's first direct order to a manufacturer. A direct order for 25 additional A320neos followed in January 2013, bringing up the total order to 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/citilink-orders-25-airbus-a320neo/ |title=Citilink orders 25 Airbus A320neo |publisher=Airbus |date= 25 January 2013|accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citilink's first A320, a second-hand aircraft, arrived in late June 2011 and entered into service on 16 September 2011, linking Jakarta with Balikpapan, Banjarmasin and Medan.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In September 2013, Citilink cancelled its plan to operate ATR 72s as its parent company Garuda Indonesia took over the order, citing commercial reasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Services==
===Cabin===
Citilink aircraft cabins have standard configuration of 180 seats. In July 2018, Citilink introduced "Green Zone" programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2018/07/19/citilink-introduces-green-zone-facility.html|title=Citilink introduces Green Zone facility|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=19 July 2018|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seats on the first five rows and emergency window exit rows are named green seats, while the rest are named regular seats. Passengers wanting to book or request a green seat or specific regular seat during booking or check-in will be charged for a certain fee. Additional benefits include free snacks, drinks, and insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.citilink.co.id/en/green-zone|title=Green Zone|publisher=Citilink|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accidents and incidents==
===Citilink Flight 800 incident===
On 28 December 2016, a video taken by a passenger aboard Citilink Flight 800, a flight from [[Juanda International Airport]] in [[Surabaya]] to [[Soekarno-Hatta International Airport]] in [[Jakarta]] went viral after it purportedly showed a drunk pilot making a "bizarre announcement" before take off. Several passengers immediately reported the incident to the airline's headquarters. The crew of the flight quickly removed the drunk pilot from the cockpit. Due to the incident, the flight was delayed for an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Pilot Ngelantur di Pesawat, Penerbangan Citilink Sempat Delay|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/d-3381991/pilot-ngelantur-di-pesawat-penerbangan-citilink-sempat-delay|publisher=Detik|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citilink immediately took action by [[firing|sacking]] the pilot involved in the incident and issuing letters of apology to affected passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Penjelasan Lengkap Citilink Soal Pilot Ngelantur Jelang Terbang|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/d-3382103/penjelasan-lengkap-citilink-soal-pilot-ngelantur-jelang-terbang|publisher=Detik|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the video went viral, the incident brought negative scrutiny on the already reeling Indonesian aviation industry, sparking massive public outcry. The incident was widely reported in the media, with several international news organizations covering the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Shocking CCTV footage shows 'drunk' pilot stumbling through security before being fired when he 'tried to fly a plane with 154 passengers on board'|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2502956/shocking-cctv-footage-shows-drunk-pilot-stumbling-through-security-before-being-fired-when-he-tried-to-fly-a-plane-with-154-passengers-on-board/|publisher=The Sun|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian Transport Ministry apologized publicly to the Indonesian people due to the incident. The ministry later added that the pilot had undergone drug testing, conducted by the Indonesian National Narcotic Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=

Another video, captured from cameras at the airport security checkpoint, later surfaced and went viral. The video showed the drunk pilot becoming jittery and even nearly losing his balance during the security check.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Allegedly drunk pilot filmed stumbling through security|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/12/30/drunk-pilot-indonesia/96007366/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police investigated the video, resulting in the Indonesian Transport Ministry sending Citilink its very first warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Ada Pilot Mabuk, Kemhub Layangkan Peringatan Pertama ke Citilink|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/d-3384785/ada-pilot-mabuk-kemhub-layangkan-peringatan-pertama-ke-citilink|publisher=Detik|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the incident, the CEO of Citilink, Albert Burhan, resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Pilotnya Diduga Mabuk, CEO Citilink Mengundurkan Diri|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/d-3384597/pilotnya-diduga-mabuk-ceo-citilink-mengundurkan-diri|publisher=Detik|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operational director of Citilink, Hadinoto Soedigno, also resigned in response to the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Two Indonesian airline executives resign after footage shows pilot staggering to plane|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-31/indonesian-airline-executives-resign-after-pilot-video-released/8155374|publisher=ABC|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian Transport Minister Budi Karya praised their actions due to the incident, stating that they were "very gentle".&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=CEO Citilink Mundur, Menhub: Sangat Gentle!|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/d-3385076/ceo-citilink-mundur-menhub-sangat-gentle|publisher=Detik|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Ewen Cameron''' &lt;small&gt;[[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]]&lt;/small&gt; (23 June 1841, [[Aberdeen]] &amp;ndash; 10 December 1908, [[London]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[merchant banker]] and [[chartered accountant]] of the [[Victorian era|late 19th century]], who rose to be [[chairman]] of [[Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation|Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank]] in [[City of London|London]].
He played a key role in arranging loans from the [[Rothschild family]] to the [[Empire of Japan]] during the [[Russo-Japanese War]].&lt;ref name="Rothschild archive"&gt;{{Citation| last = Smethurst| first = Richard| url =https://www.rothschildarchive.org/materials/ar2006japan.pdf| title = Takahasi Korekiyo, the Rothschilds and the Russo-Japanese War, 1904–1907| format = PDF| accessdate =26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1191155/Claims-David-Cameron-30m-fortune-sit-uneasily-taxpayers-So-truth-money.html| title=Claims that David Cameron has a £30m fortune sit uneasily with taxpayers.

==Early life and family==
[[File:Easter Muckovie Farm trigpoint - geograph.org.uk - 377530.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Muckovie, Inverness-shire]]
Cameron was born in [[Inverness-shire]], [[Scotland]], the eldest child of William Cameron (b. 4 February 1806 at [[List of listed buildings in Boleskine And Abertarff, Highland|Abertarff]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottishchurches.org.uk/sites/site/id/4361/name/Abbey+Church+Boleskine+and+Abertarff+Highland www.scottishchurches.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Inverness|Upper Muckovie]], near [[Culloden, Highland|Culloden]] by [[Croy, Highland|Croy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strathnairnheritage.org.uk/index.asp?pageid=543358 www.strathnairnheritage.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; by his wife (m. 16 June 1840), Catherine Cameron (b. 22 January 1809), daughter of Ewen Cameron (1775–1842), a farmer and [[kinship|kinsman]] of [[Tomchrasky]], [[Glen Moriston]] and [[Clan Donald|Helen McDonnell]] (1776–1861).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clan-cameron.org.au/pedigree.php?personID=I34514&amp;tree=cameron1 Pedigree for Ewan Cameron, Cameron Genealogies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wargs.com/noble/cameron.html&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Caledonian - geograph.org.uk - 885545.jpg|thumb|right|135px|Caledonian Bank, former HQ in Aberdeen]]

==Career==
In 1859, Cameron joined the [[Bank of Scotland|Caledonian Bank]] in [[Aberdeen]] as an accounting clerk. After qualifying as a [[chartered accountant]] he was posted to the [[Bank of Hindustan, China and Japan]] before being transferred to [[Hong Kong]] in 1866. His abilities, described as "remarkable" by ''[[The Times]]'', helped him to land a senior position with the newly formed [[Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation|Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank]] after the Bank of Hindustan went into liquidation.

A [[chartered accountant]], Cameron became principal agent to the [[Calcutta]] branch of HSBC, following which he acted as [[Branch (banking)|manager]] of its [[Shanghai]] branch, where he served until 1890. Cameron's success in reorganizing the bank was rewarded by his appointment as a [[director (business)|director]] before he returned to Britain, where he became chairman of the bank in the [[City of London]].

Cameron was appointed [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]] at the end of 1901 for his "services to overseas banking",&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', Obituary, 11 December 1908&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society]] (FRGS) in February 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular|day_of_week=Wednesday |date=12 February 1902 |page_number=9 |issue=36689| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1904 Cameron and other leading London financiers, including [[John Baring, 2nd Baron Revelstoke|Lord Revelstoke]] of [[Barings Bank|Baring Bros.]], Arthur Francis Levita and [[Koch family|W. M. Koch]] of [[Panmure Gordon]] (Levita's daughter Enid would later marry Cameron's grandson Ewen Donald Cameron in 1930), [[Marcus Samuel, 1st Viscount Bearsted|Sir Marcus Samuel]] (later Viscount Bearsted) of [[Samuel Samuel &amp; Co]] and  [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[Sir Carl Meyer 1st Baronet|Sir Carl Meyer]], and [[Otto Kahn]], took part in negotiations with the [[Bank of Japan|Japanese central banker]] [[Takahashi Korekiyo]] (later [[Prime Minister of Japan]]) for the selling of war bonds to finance the Japanese war effort during the [[Russo-Japanese War]].&lt;ref name="Rothschild archive" /&gt;

==Marriage and issue==
In 1878, Cameron married Josephine Elizabeth (born at [[Redenhall with Harleston|Shotford]], [[Norfolk]] in 1857), daughter of John Houchen of [[Thetford]], [[Norfolk]] ([[Wereham]], Norfolk, c. 1818 - Thetford, Norfolk, 6 October 1898&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'' 11 Oct 1898, 1A&lt;/ref&gt;) by his wife (m. [[St James's]], [[Westminster]], 29 November 1845&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' Jan. 1846, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;) Susannah Vautier ([[Stanton, Suffolk|Stanton]], [[Suffolk]], c. 1819 - Thetford, Norfolk, 1859), by whom he had five children.

His eldest son, Ewen Allan Cameron, [[senior partner]] in [[Panmure Gordon &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', "Committee for Bondholders", 2 November 1935&lt;/ref&gt; and member of the [[Council of Foreign Bondholders]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', "Council of Foreign Bondholders", 24 July 1936&lt;/ref&gt; (who died 14 November 1937 in [[Vienna]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', "Deaths", 16 November 1937&lt;/ref&gt;) was the great-grandfather of [[David Cameron]], [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party Leader]] (2005–2016) and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] (2010–2016).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clan-cameron.org.au/pedigree.php?personID=I34518&amp;tree=cameron1 Pedigree for Ewen Donald Cameron], Cameron Genealogies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p17890.htm#i178900 Ewen Donald Cameron], thePeerage.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
After suffering bouts of ill health in 1903 and at the end of 1904, Sir Ewen retired in February 1905 and later died at home in [[Hampstead]] [[NW postcode area|NW3]] on 10 December 1908 at the age of 67.

The {{nihongo|'''Financial Instruments and Exchange Act'''|金融商品取引法|Kin'yū shōhin torihiki-hō}}, promulgated on June 14, 2006, is the main [[statute]] codifying [[securities law]] and regulating securities companies in Japan.

The law provides for:

* Registration and regulation of [[broker dealer]]s and their [[registered representative]]s
* [[Corporation#Financial disclosure|Disclosure]] obligations applicable to public companies, [[investment trust]]s and similar entities
* [[Tender offer]] rules
* Disclosure obligations applicable to large shareholders in public companies
* [[Internal control]]s in public companies; in this role the law is often referred to as '''J-SOX''', a reference to the American [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] (SOX).

==J-SOX provisions==
The internal control portions of the FIEA were largely enacted in response to [[corporate scandal]]s such as the Kanebo, [[Livedoor]], and [[Murakami Fund scandal|Murakami Fund]] episodes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The Internal Control Committee of the Business Accounting Council of the Japanese Financial Services Agency provided final Implementation Guidance for Management Assessment and Audit of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR) in February 2007. The Implementation Guidance provides details to Japanese companies on how to implement a Management Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting as required under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law.

The Financial Instruments and Exchange Act became effective in April 2008 for roughly 3,800 companies listed in Japan, along with their foreign subsidiaries.

Forrester Research lists the following challenges and differences between J-SOX and SOX:
* Professional services. Japan has fewer than 10% of the number of qualified accountants than the US. 
* Independence of auditors. While the concept of auditor independence exists in the Japanese market similar to the US, many Japanese firms can and will rely on the influence and recommendations of their audit firms. 
* Audit automation is critical. With the extreme shortage of auditors compared to US per capita numbers, this shortage will increase the requirement and necessity for process efficiency in the internal audit process and software that can support these processes. 
* Support of IT governance. In the November guidance regarding the scope of the J-SOX process, it is clear that IT controls are a central point of focus for J-SOX

The organization also offers the Certified International Trade Professional designation, also trademarked as the FITT International Business Professional designation in the U.S. and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fittfortrade.com/fibp-details|title=FIBP Details|website=Forum for International Trade Training (FITT)|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often referred to as the CITP|FIBP designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fittfortrade.com/certification|title=Professional International Business Certification CITP {{!}} FIBP|website=Forum for International Trade Training (FITT)|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In French, it is referred to as the Professionnel accrédité en commerce international (PACI|FPAI) designation.

FITT's strategic partners are [[Export Development Canada|Export Development Canada (EDC)]], [[Global Affairs Canada|Global Affairs Canada (GAC)]] and the [[World Trade Centers Association]].

== History ==
In the late 1980s, Dieter Hollweck,  began the planning towards a new organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tradeready.ca/2014/inside-stories/story-began-us-forum-international-trade-training-fitt/|title=The story of how it all began for us, the Forum for International Trade Training (FITT) - Trade Ready|website=Trade Ready|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; FITT was then incorporated in 1992 as part of Canada’s sector council initiative.

FITT first launched its FITTskills training program in 1993, which is now in its sixth edition, with the seventh edition being launched in early 2017. In 1996, it also launched the Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR) process to allow business professionals to use their previous work and educational experience to earn FITTskills credits. FITTskills courses were first offered online in 1999, which continues today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fittfortrade.com/about-us/milestones|title=Milestones|website=Forum for International Trade Training (FITT)|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, FITT began to accredit [[academic institution]]s and organizations already offering international business courses to offer FITTskills courses. There are currently over 43 educational partners in Canada, China, Colombia, Malaysia, Romania and the UK, offering FITTskills courses in a classroom setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fittfortrade.com/instructorled-courses|title=Instructor Led Courses|website=Forum for International Trade Training (FITT)|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FITT's CITP designation was first offered in 1998, and the competency requirements were revised in 2006 and again in 2016. Since 2009, it has also been trademarked as the FIBP designation in the U.S. and Europe.

FITT has also awarded honorary CITP|FIBP designations to several notable figures in international trade, including former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister [[John Manley]], Canadian Chamber of Commerce CEO [[Perrin Beatty]], Governor of the [[Bank of Canada]] [[Stephen Poloz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eshaabrol.com/tag/citp-designation/|title=CITP Designation {{!}} Entrepreneur Journal|website=eshaabrol.com|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smith.queensu.ca/emails/poloz.php|title=QBC Ottawa featuring Stephen Poloz|website=smith.queensu.ca|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former Canadian [[Minister of International Trade (Canada)|Minister of International Trade]] [[Stockwell Day]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''Sir Francis "Frank" Joseph Edmund Beaurepaire''' (13 May 1891 &amp;ndash; 29 May 1956) was an [[Australia]]n distance [[freestyle swimming|freestyle]] swimmer from the 1900s to the 1920s, who won three silver and three bronze medals, from the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]] to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], setting 15 world records.

He was also a decorated politician and businessman, serving for ten years in the [[Victorian Legislative Council]] and as [[Lord Mayor of Melbourne]] and building a multimillion-dollar tyre business empire, [[Beaurepaires and Olympic Tyres]].

==Early life==
Beaurepaire was born to Francis Edmund de Beaurepaire, a cable tram conductor, and Mary Edith Inman. Growing up in [[Melbourne]], Beaurepaire was educated at [[Albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]] State School and [[Wesley College (Victoria)|Wesley College]].&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Poynter|first=J.R.|id=A070234b|title=Beaurepaire, Frank|accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had his first swimming lesson at the age of four, when his father dropped him into the sea water baths at [[South Melbourne, Victoria|South Melbourne]] with a rope tied around his waist. He often practised in the sea, close to where effluent was ejected into [[Port Phillip Bay]]. Later, when he had earned more money, he paid tuppence (2d. = two pence) to enter the now demolished Stubbs' South Melbourne Baths to train.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

His career was nearly ended when he was hospitalized for 12 months with [[rheumatic fever]]. However, encouraged by his schoolteacher and South Melbourne barber Tommy Horlock, who later became his coach, Beaurepaire fought off the ailment and resumed training with the [[Albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]] State School Swimming Club.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Swimming career==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
In 1906, a few months before his 15th birthday, Beaurepaire won the {{convert|220|yd|abbr=on}} and {{convert|440|yd|abbr=on}} freestyle at the Victorian championships. In 1908, he captured the {{convert|440|yd|abbr=on}}, 880&amp;nbsp;yd and mile freestyle events at the Australian Championships to claim a spot in the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] team. On arrival in [[London]] with Horlock, he found that no arrangements had been made to pick them up, so they were forced to live with 16 pounds between them for a month, before officials became aware of their plight.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Beaurepaire trained in London for three months before the Games. Unable to afford admission to [[swimming pool]]s, He was forced to train at [[Highgate Ponds]], at temperatures of 10&amp;nbsp;°C. After a {{convert|15|mi|km|sing=on}} event in the [[River Thames]] prior to the Olympics he was numbed by the cold to such an extent that he collapsed and needed to be pulled from the water to avoid drowning. Later he won the {{convert|880|yd|abbr=on}} British Championship at [[Bradford]], defeating [[Henry Taylor (swimmer)|Henry Taylor]] of [[Lancashire]], and then proceeded to win the {{convert|220|yd|abbr=on}} event at [[Nottingham]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Arriving at the Olympics, the competitors were confronted with a pool dug into the [[Athletics (track and field)|athletics]] track, with no filtration or chlorination, effectively being a muddy pond. Beaurepaire had caught [[influenza]] and finished in second and third in the 400&amp;nbsp;m and 1500&amp;nbsp;m freestyle respectively, both events being won by Taylor. He was eliminated in the heats of the 100&amp;nbsp;m freestyle. He also finished fourth in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay. After the Olympics, Beaurepaire again raced Taylor over {{convert|500|yd|abbr=on}} and one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) in Britain, winning the latter, in which some 20,000 spectators attended.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Returning to Australia, he broke the {{convert|300|yd|abbr=on}} world record at the [[Melbourne City Baths]]. He reappeared prominently in 1910 when he won more than a dozen state and national titles, breaking the world {{convert|220|yd|abbr=on}} freestyle record in the process. His tour of the [[United Kingdom]] and continental [[Europe]] later that year resulted in world records in the 200&amp;nbsp;m, 300&amp;nbsp;m, {{convert|300|yd|abbr=on}}, 400&amp;nbsp;m, 500&amp;nbsp;m and {{convert|1000|yd|abbr=on}}, three of which were achieved in one race. He later swept all of the British championships from {{convert|100|yd|abbr=on}} up to one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km). He competed in 41 first-class and championship races in four months, winning all of them.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 1911, after his long return by sea to Australia, he suffered his first defeat in three years and was forced to abandon the {{convert|440|yd|abbr=on}} freestyle event at the Australian Championships mid-race. Due to exhaustion, he took a break from competitive swimming to become a swimming instructor, earning 3 pounds 10 shillings (₤3/10/-) a week with the Victorian Department of Education as a physical education instructor.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

He was barred from Olympic competition by the [[International Swimming Federation]], which ruled him to be a professional, although he was not earning money for swimming. This ruled him out of the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]], where the Australian 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;200&amp;nbsp;m freestyle relay team won gold. The decision to bar him was reversed in 1914.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

He joined the [[Australian Defence Force]] as an infantryman, but was invalided and joined the [[YMCA]] services, and served in [[Egypt]], [[England]] and [[France]] before being hospitalized in 1917 with trench fever and gassing, and being returned to Australia.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In February 1920, he won the Victorian championships, and soon after broke the 1000&amp;nbsp;m world record and qualified for the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]]. With swimming held in a near-freezing open-water canal, Beaurepaire abandoned the 400&amp;nbsp;m freestyle mid-race due to illness, but managed to claim a bronze in the 1500&amp;nbsp;m freestyle. He combined with [[William Herald]], [[Ivan Stedman]] and [[Harry Hay (swimmer)|Henry Hay]] to claim the silver medal in the 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;200&amp;nbsp;m freestyle relay, some 21&amp;nbsp;s behind the American squad.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

His sister [[Lily Beaurepaire|Lily]] also competed as part of the swimming and diving team, becoming the first brother-sister combination to represent [[Australia at the Summer Olympics]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Back in Australia and later in [[Hawaii]] that year, he broke the {{convert|1000|yd|abbr=on}} and one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) records, and twice broke the 1000&amp;nbsp;m and 1500&amp;nbsp;m records. He was named as the captain of the swimming team for the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]]. He was eliminated in the heats of the 400&amp;nbsp;m freestyle, but at the age of 34 he claimed bronze in the 1500&amp;nbsp;m freestyle, behind fellow Australian [[Boy Charlton]] and [[Sweden]]'s [[Arne Borg]]. He won a silver medal in the 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;200&amp;nbsp;m freestyle relay alongside Charlton, [[Ernest Henry (swimmer)|Ernest Henry]] and [[Moss Christie]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

His last competitive appearance was his victory at [[Kew, Victoria]] in the State Championships in March 1928, which he won at 37 years of age. In all he set 15 world records over a span of 13 years, winning 79 Victorian titles, 11 British titles and a record 34 Australian titles. It was not until 2000 that [[Susie O'Neill]] broke his Australian record.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 1922, he was awarded the [[Royal Humane Society]] Gold Medal and 550 pounds, a significant sum in that era, after assisting another lifesaver, [[Jack Chalmers]]&lt;ref&gt;http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/chalmers-john-jack-12303&lt;/ref&gt; in rescuing a shark attack victim at [[Coogee, New South Wales]], a suburb of [[Sydney]]. He used this to start [[Beaurepaires]], a tyres, wheels, batteries business, which had assets worth more than 8 million pounds at his death. The business now has over 230 stores in Australia. He attended the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] as a swimming official and judge.

==Local, state and federal politics==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
From 1940-42, Beaurepaire was the [[Lord Mayor of Melbourne]]. He was knighted in the King's Birthday Honours of 1942.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1083700&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true Profile], itsanhonour.gov.au; accessed 21 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected to the [[Victorian Legislative Council]] in 1942, serving until 1952. He was an unsuccessful candidate for [[Senate (Australia)|Senate]] for the [[United Australia Party]] in the [[Australian federal election, 1943|1943 federal election]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 1948 he was part of a delegation that went to [[London]] to lobby at the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] for Melbourne to host the [[1956 Summer Olympics]]. In 1949 Melbourne won the hosting rights and Beaurepaire was again re-elected as Lord Mayor. He hoped that he could preside over the Games. However, he died of a heart attack in the barber's chair at the [[Hotel Windsor (Melbourne)|Hotel Windsor]], just seven months before the Games. His son, [[Ian Francis Beaurepaire]], was also a Lord Mayor of Melbourne.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''Sir Gerrard Jude "Gerry" Robinson''' (born 23 October 1948, [[Dunfanaghy]], [[County Donegal]], [[Ireland]]) is an Irish-born British business executive and television presenter. He is the former non-executive Chairman of [[Allied Domecq]] and the ex-Chairman/chief executive of [[Granada plc|Granada]].

==Early life==
The ninth of 10 children born to Anthony and Elizabeth Robinson, an Irish father and a [[Scotland|Scottish]] mother, Robinson moved with his family to England from [[County Donegal]] in his early teens. He briefly trained to become a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priest at [[Castle Head, Grange-over-Sands|St. Mary's Seminary]] of the [[Holy Ghost Fathers]] at Castlehead, [[Grange-over-Sands]], [[Lancashire]]. He began a career in accounting in 1965 as a clerk with the [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox Toys]] company. While with the firm, he progressed through various accounting roles to become Chief Management Accountant in 1974. He also, during that time, qualified as an Associate Chartered Management Accountant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personallyspeakingbureau.com/speaker/gerry-robinson-sir/|title=Gerry Robinson, Sir - Personally Speaking Bureau|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1974, he left Matchbox to work for [[Lex Vehicle Leasing]] as a management accountant. He then rose through the company before being appointed finance director. In 1980, he joined the UK franchise of [[Coca-Cola]], owned at that time by [[Grand Metropolitan]]. In 1983 he was appointed managing director of Grand Metropolitan's international services division. In 1987 he led the successful £163m management buyout of the loss-making contract services and catering division of [[Compass Group]], known as Compass Caterers. He joined [[Granada plc|Granada]] as CEO in 1991, and soon ousted Granada's chairman, [[David Plowright]] in 1992, which led [[John Cleese]] to call Robinson "an upstart caterer ".&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1527549/David-Plowright.html|title=David Plowright obituary|publisher=''The Telegraph''|date=30 August 2006|accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson steered the company through various mergers, and hostile takeovers including [[London Weekend Television]] (1993) and [[Forte Group]] (1996). In 1999 Robinson was the subject of a biography, ''Lord of the Dance'', written by business journalist [[William Kay (journalist)|William Kay]], and published by Orion Business Books {{ISBN|0752810480}}. In 2005 he made an unsuccessful attempt to oust Doug Flynn as CEO of [[Rentokil Initial]] and install himself as Executive chairman for a 5% stake in the company, then valued at £56M. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Television==
Robinson's first foray into broadcasting was a revival of the [[BBC]]'s [[Troubleshooter (TV series)|''Troubleshooter'']] show, originally fronted by Sir [[John Harvey-Jones]] in the early 1990s. Titled ''I'll Show Them Who's Boss'' and co-produced by the [[Open University]], in 2004 he went into struggling businesses to try to turn them round by advice and mentoring.

In January 2007 following a similar format, he presented a three-part series, ''[[Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHS?]]'' as he attempted to reduce waiting lists at [[Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust|Rotherham General Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open2.net/nhs/about_the_series.html|title=BBC/OU Open2.net, "Can Gerry Robinson Fix The NHS?"|publisher=Open2.net|date=|accessdate= 14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned a year later for a sequel, ''Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHS? One Year On''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open2.net/nhs/oneyearon/oneyearonsummary.html|title=BBC/OU Open2.net – Can Gerry Robinson Fix The NHS? One Year On|publisher=Open2.net|date=22 November 2007|accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, Robinson presented a programme in a similar format entitled ''Can Gerry Robinson Fix Dementia Care Homes?''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Gerry Robinson Fix Dementia Care Homes?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00pf0s2|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 January 2014|author=British Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009 he presented a special edition of ''[[The Money Programme]]'' entitled ''Gerry Robinson's Car Crash'' investigating the history and future of the [[British motor industry]]. He regularly appears on British TV as a celebrity businessman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1831101/bio IMDb bio]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009 he started a TV series called ''Gerry's Big Decision'', in which he reviews struggling companies and decides whether it is worth investing his own money to save them.
From 14 January – 18 February 2011 he presented [[BBC2]] show ''Can't Take It with You'', which helps people to write their [[will (law)|will]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xk532]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other affiliations==
Robinson also served as chairman of the [[Arts Council England]] for six years from 1998, in which capacity he was one of the many victims of a spoof by British comedian [[Ali G]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gerry-robinson-news.newslib.com Gerry Robinson official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Robinson has divorced and remarried and has four children. He lives in Raphoe,Co Donegal &lt;ref&gt;http://www.oakfieldpark.com/ Oakfield Park&lt;/ref&gt; ; he established a botanical garden with a narrow gauge railway – the Difflin Lake Railway – which is open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2007/10/07/story27146.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214073506/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2007/10/07/story27146.asp |archivedate=14 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Although originally a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] supporter, he supported [[Tony Blair]] and starred in a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[party political broadcast|election broadcast]], saying that ''"... frankly, there's only one party that can represent Britain best, getting business right, and that's New Labour"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardianlies.com/Granada%20TV/page3.html|title=Granada TV Part Two: Comrades at the Top|publisher=GuardianLies.com|accessdate=14 July 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911030207/http://www.guardianlies.com/Granada%20TV/page3.html|archivedate=11 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{emotion}}

'''Grief''' is a multifaceted response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or something that has [[death|died]], to which a [[human bonding|bond]] or [[affection]] was formed. Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, spiritual and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, ''bereavement'' refers to the state of loss, and ''grief'' is the reaction to that loss.

Grief is a natural response to loss. It is the emotional suffering one feels when something or someone the individual loves is taken away. The grief associated with death is familiar to most people, but individuals grieve in connection with a variety of losses throughout their lives, such as unemployment, ill health or the end of a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;America, H. F. (2012). Grief.

Recently{{when|date=January 2018}}, there has been a high level of skepticism about the universal and predictable “emotional pathway” that leads from distress to “recovery” with an appreciation that grief is a more complex process of adapting to loss than stage and phase models have previously suggested. The Two-Track Model of Bereavement, created by Simon Shimshon Rubin in 1981, is a grief theory that provided deeper focus on the grieving process. The model examines the long-term effects of bereavement by measuring how well the person is adapting to the loss of a significant person in their life. The main objective of the Two-Track Model of Bereavement is for the individual to “manage and live in reality in which the deceased is absent” as well as returning to normal biological functioning. (Malkinson, 2006)

Track One is focused on the biopsychosocial functioning of grief. This focuses on the [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], somatic concerns, traumatic responses, familial relationships, interpersonal relationships, self-esteem, meaning structure, work, and investment in life tasks.  Rubin (2010) Points out, “Track 1, the range of aspects of the individuals functioning across affective, interpersonal, somatic and classical psychiatric indicators is considered”(Shimshon 686). All of the terms listed above are noted for the importance they have in relation to people’s responses to grief and loss.

The significance of the closeness between the bereaved and the deceased is important to Track 1 because this could determine the severity of the mourning and grief the bereaved will endure. This first track is the response to the extremely stressful life events and requires adaption along with change and integration.The second track focuses on the ongoing relationship you have with the deceased. Track two mainly focuses on how the bereaved was connected to the deceased and on what level of closeness was shared. The stronger the relationship to the deceased is will lead to a greater evaluation of the relationship with heightened shock. Track two brings up both the positive and negative memories that you shared with the deceased and the degree of emotional involvement you shared causing reflection.

Any memory could be a trigger for the bereaved, the way the bereaved chose to remember their loved one, and how the bereaved integrate the memory of their deceased into their daily lives.

Ten main attributes to this track include; imagery/memory, emotional distance, positive effect, negative effect, preoccupation with the loss, conflict, idealization, memorialization/transformation of the loss, impact on self-perception and loss process (shock, searching, disorganized) (Rubin, 1999). An outcome of this track is being able to recognize how transformation has occurred beyond grief and mourning (Rubin, 1999). By outlining the main aspects of the bereavement process into two interactive tracks, individuals can examine and understand how grief has affected their life following loss and begin to adapt to this post-loss life.The Model offers a better understanding with the duration of time in the wake of one's loss and the outcomes that evolve from death. By using this model, researchers can effectively examine the response to an individual’s loss by assessing the behavioral-psychological functioning and the relationship with the deceased.

The authors from ''[https://whatsyourgrief.com/rubin-two-track-model-of-bereavement/ Whats Your Grief?]'', Litza Williams and Eleanor Haley, state in their understanding of the clinical and therapeutic uses of the model:&lt;blockquote&gt;“in terms of functioning, this model can help the bereaved identify which areas of his/her life has been impacted by the grief in a negative way as well as areas that the bereaved has already begun to adapt to after the loss. If the bereaved is unable to return to their normal functioning as in before loss occurred, it is likely they will find difficulty in the process of working through the loss as well as their separation from the deceased.

Along the relational aspect, the bereaved can become aware of their relationship with the deceased and how it has changed or may change in the future” (Williams &amp; Haley, 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://whatsyourgrief.com/rubin-two-track-model-of-bereavement/|title=Understanding The Two-Track Model of Bereavement - What's Your Grief|last=Williams|first=Litza|date=2017-01-12|work=What's Your Grief|access-date=2017-12-11|last2=Haley|first2=Eleanor|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;“The Two-Track Model of Bereavement can help specify areas of mutuality (how people respond affectivity to trauma and change) and also difference (how bereaved people may be preoccupied with the deceased following loss compared to how they may be preoccupied with trauma following the exposure to it)” (Rubin, S.S, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/doi/pdf/10.1080/074811899200731?needAccess=true&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

[[Crying]] is a normal and natural part of grieving. It has also been found, however, that crying and talking about the loss is not the only healthy response and, if forced or excessive, can be harmful.&lt;ref name="americanPsychologistpdf"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.20 |title=Loss, Trauma, and Human Resilience: Have We Underestimated the Human Capacity to Thrive After Extremely Aversive Events? |year=2004 |last1=Bonanno |first1=George A. |journal=American Psychologist |volume=59 |pages=20–8 |pmid=14736317 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time_NWTAG"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2042372.html New Ways to Think About Grief.

Pressing people to cry or retell the experience of a loss can be harmful.&lt;ref name="Time_NWTAG"/&gt; Genuine [[laughter]] is healthy.&lt;ref name="americanPsychologistpdf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

=== Bonanno's four trajectories of grief ===
{{Main|George Bonanno}}

George Bonanno, a [[professor]] of [[clinical psychology]] at [[Columbia University]], conducted more than two decades of scientific studies on grief and trauma, which have been published in several papers in the most respected peer-reviewed journals in the field of psychology, such as ''[[Psychological Science]]'' and ''The [[Journal of Abnormal Psychology]]''. Subjects of his studies number in the several thousand and include people who have suffered losses in the U.S. and cross-cultural studies in various countries around the world, such as Israel, [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], and China. His subjects suffered losses through war, [[terrorism]], deaths of children, premature deaths of spouses, [[sexual abuse]], childhood diagnoses of AIDS, and other potentially devastating loss events or potential trauma events.

In Bonanno's book, ''The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After a Loss'' ({{ISBN|978-0-465-01360-9}}), he summarizes his research.
His findings include that a natural resilience is the main component of grief and trauma reactions.&lt;ref name="americanPsychologistpdf"/&gt;  The first researcher to use pre-loss data, he outlined four trajectories of grief.&lt;ref name="americanPsychologistpdf"/&gt; Bonanno's work has also demonstrated that absence of grief or trauma symptoms is a healthy outcome, rather than something to be feared as has been the thought and practice until his research.&lt;ref name="SA_NTG" /&gt; Because grief responses can take many forms, including laughter, celebration, and bawdiness, in addition to sadness,&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giftofireland.com/Irishwakes.htm|title=The Irish Wake Tradition - Exploring Irish Wakes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonanno coined the phrase "coping ugly" to describe the idea that some forms of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] may seem counter intuitive.&lt;ref name="SA_NTG" /&gt; Bonanno has found that resilience is natural to humans, suggesting that it cannot be "taught" through specialized programs&lt;ref name="SA_NTG" /&gt; and that there is virtually no existing research with which to design resilience training, nor is there existing research to support major investment in such things as military resilience training programs.&lt;ref name="SA_NTG" /&gt;

The four trajectories are as follows:

* '''Resilience''': "The ability of adults in otherwise normal circumstances who are exposed to an isolated and potentially highly disruptive event, such as the death of a close relation or a violent or life-threatening situation, to maintain relatively stable, healthy levels of psychological and physical functioning" as well as "the capacity for generative experiences and positive emotions."
* '''Recovery''': When "normal functioning temporarily gives way to threshold or sub-threshold [[psychopathology]] (e.g., symptoms of depression or [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]], or PTSD), usually for a period of at least several months, and then gradually returns to pre-event levels."
* '''Chronic dysfunction''': Prolonged suffering and inability to function, usually lasting several years or longer.
* '''Delayed grief or trauma''': When adjustment seems normal but then distress and symptoms increase months later. Researchers have not found evidence of [[delayed grief]], but delayed trauma appears to be a genuine phenomenon.

== Five stages theory ==
{{Main|Kübler-Ross model}}

The [[Kübler-Ross model]], commonly known as the five stages of grief, is a theory first introduced by [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]] in her 1969 book, ''On Death and Dying''.&lt;ref&gt;Broom, Sarah M. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,689491,00.html "Milestones: Aug. 30, 2004"], ''TIME'' website&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the uncredited earlier work of John Bowlby and Colin Murray-Parkes, Kübler-Ross actually applied the stages to persons who were dying, not persons who were grieving.  Her studies involved her work with the terminally ill. The popular but empirically unsupported model describes in five distinct stages how people deal with their impending death.

The five stages are:

# denial
# anger
# bargaining
# depression
# acceptance

The theory holds that the stages are a part of the framework that helps people learn to live without what they have lost.

The stages model, which came about in the 1960s, is a theory based on observation of people who are dying, not people who experienced the death of a loved one. This model found limited empirical support in a study by Maciejewski et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.297.7.716 |title=An Empirical Examination of the Stage Theory of Grief |year=2007 |last1=MacIejewski |first1=P. K. |last2=Zhang |first2=B. |last3=Block |first3=S. D. |last4=Prigerson |first4=H. G. |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=297 |issue=7 |pages=716–23 |pmid=17312291}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is that the sequence was correct although Acceptance was highest at all points throughout the persons experience. The research of [[George Bonanno]], however, is acknowledged as debunking the five stages of grief because his large body of peer-reviewed studies show that the vast majority of people who have experienced a loss are resilient and that there are multiple trajectories following loss.

== Physiological and neurological processes ==

[[File:El Greco Pietà.jpg|thumb|"[[Pietà]]" by [[El Greco]], 1571–1576. Philadelphia Museum of Art]]

Studies of [[fMRI]] scans of women from whom grief was elicited about the death of a mother or a sister in the past 5 years resulted in the conclusion that grief produced a local inflammation response as measured by salivary concentrations of [[pro-inflammatory cytokine]]s. These responses were correlated with activation in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]]. This activation also correlated with the free recall of grief-related word stimuli. This suggests that grief can cause stress, and that this reaction is linked to the emotional processing parts of the [[frontal lobe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.05.049 |title=When grief heats up: Pro-inflammatory cytokines predict regional brain activation |year=2009 |last1=O'Connor |first1=Mary-Frances |last2=Irwin |first2=Michael R. |last3=Wellisch |first3=David K. |journal=NeuroImage |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=891–6 |pmid=19481155 |pmc=2760985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Activation of the anterior cingulate cortex and [[vagus nerve]] is similarly implicated in the experience of [[broken heart|heartbreak]] whether due to social rejection or bereavement.&lt;!-- refs on linked article --&gt;

Among those persons who have been bereaved within the previous three months of a given report, those who report many intrusive thoughts about the deceased show ventral [[amygdala]] and rostral [[anterior cingulate cortex]] hyperactivity to reminders of their loss. In the case of the amygdala, this links to their sadness intensity. In those individuals who avoid such thoughts, there is a related opposite type of pattern in which there is a decrease in the activation of the dorsal amgydala and the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]].

In those not so emotionally affected by reminders of their loss, studies of [[fMRI]] scans have been used to conclude that there is a high functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala activity, suggesting that the former regulates activity in the latter. In those people who had greater intensity of sadness, there was a low functional connection between the rostal anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala activity, suggesting a lack of regulation of the former part of the brain upon the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.01.019 |title=Neural Mechanisms of Grief Regulation |year=2009 |last1=Freed |first1=Peter J. |last2=Yanagihara |first2=Ted K. |last3=Hirsch |first3=Joy |last4=Mann |first4=J. John |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=66 |pages=33–40 |pmid=19249748 |issue=1 |pmc=2782609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary theories ==

From an evolutionary perspective, grief is perplexing because it appears costly, and it is not clear what benefits it provides the sufferer. Several researchers have proposed functional explanations for grief, attempting to solve this puzzle. Sigmund Freud argued that grief is a process of libidinal reinvestment. The griever must, Freud argued, disinvest from the deceased, which is a painful process.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1957). Mourning and Melancholia. In J. Strachey (Ed. and Trans.), ''The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud'' (Vol. 14, pp. 152-170). London, England: Hogarth Press. (Original work published 1917)&lt;/ref&gt; But this disinvestment allows the griever to use libidinal energies on other, possibly new attachments, so it provides a valuable function. John Archer, approaching grief from an attachment theory perspective, argued that grief is a byproduct of the human attachment system.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, J. (1999). ''The nature of grief: The evolution and psychology of reactions to loss''. London, England: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, a grief-type response is adaptive because it compels a social organism to search for a lost individual (e.g., a mother or a child). However, in the case of death, the response is maladaptive because the individual is not simply lost and the griever cannot reunite with the deceased. Grief, from this perspective, is a painful cost of the human capacity to form commitments.

Other researchers such as Randolph Nesse have proposed that grief is a kind of psychological pain that orients the sufferer to a new existence without the deceased and creates a painful but instructive memory.&lt;ref&gt;Nesse, R. M. (2005). An evolutionary framework for understanding grief. In D. Carr, R. M. Nesse, &amp; C. B. Wortman (Eds.), ''Late life widowhood in the United States: Spousal bereavement in late life'' (pp. 195-226). New York, New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; If, for example, leaving an offspring alone at a watering hole led to the offspring’s death, grief creates an intensively painful memory of the event, dissuading a parent from ever again leaving an offspring alone at a watering hole.  More recently, Winegard, Reynolds, Winegard, Baumeister, and Maner argued that grief might be a socially selected signal of an individual’s propensity for forming strong, committed relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Winegard B. M. |author2=Reynolds T. |author3=Baumeister R. F. |author4=Winegard B. |author5=Maner J. K. | year = 2014 | title = Grief functions as an honest indicator of commitment | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 168–186 | doi=10.1177/1088868314521016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this social signaling perspective, grief targets old and new social partners, informing them that the griever is capable of forming strong social commitments. That is, because grief signals a person's capacity to form strong and faithful social bonds, those who displayed prolonged grief responses were preferentially chosen by alliance partners. The authors argue that throughout human evolution, grief was therefore shaped and elaborated by the social decisions of selective alliance partners.

== Risks ==

Bereavement, while a normal part of life, carries a degree of risk when severe. Severe reactions affect approximately 10% to 15% of people.&lt;ref name="americanPsychologistpdf"/&gt; Severe reactions mainly occur in people with depression present before the loss event.&lt;ref name="americanPsychologistpdf"/&gt; Severe grief reactions may carry over into family relations. Some researchers have found an increased risk of marital breakup following the death of a child, for example. Others have found no increase. John James, author of the Grief Recovery Handbook and founder of the Grief Recovery Institute, reported that his marriage broke up after the death of his infant son.

Many studies have looked at the bereaved in terms of increased risks for stress-related illnesses. [[Colin Murray Parkes]] in the 1960s and 1970s in England noted increased doctor visits, with symptoms such as abdominal pain, breathing difficulties, and so forth in the first six months following a death. Others have noted increased mortality rates (Ward, A.W. 1976) and Bunch et al. found a five times greater risk of [[suicide]] in teens following the death of a parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00578368 |title=Suicide following bereavement of parents |year=1971 |last1=Bunch |first1=J. |last2=Barraclough |first2=B. |last3=Nelson |first3=B. |last4=Sainsbury |first4=P. |journal=Social Psychiatry |volume=6 |issue=4 |page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complicated grief ==

[[Prolonged grief disorder|Prolonged grief disorder (PGD)]], formerly known as [[Complicated grief disorder|complicated grief disorder (CGD)]], is a pathological reaction to loss representing a cluster of empirically derived symptoms that have been associated with long-term physical and psycho-social dysfunction. Individuals with PGD experience severe grief symptoms for at least six months and are stuck in a maladaptive state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lichtentahl|first=W.

Shear and colleagues found an effective treatment for complicated grief, by treating the reactions in the same way as trauma reactions.&lt;ref name="Bonanno2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2850.2006.00014.x |title=Is Complicated Grief a Valid Construct? |year=2006 |last1=Bonanno |first1=George A. |journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice |volume=13 |issue=2 |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.293.21.2601 |title=Treatment of Complicated Grief: A Randomized Controlled Trial |year=2005 |last1=Shear |first1=K. |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=293 |issue=21 |page=2601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complicated grief is not synonymous with grief. Complicated grief is characterised by an extended grieving period and other criteria, including mental and physical impairments.&lt;ref name="Pmid"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2011.02.021 |title=The prevalence and characteristics of complicated grief in older adults |year=2011 |last1=Newson |first1=Rachel S. |last2=Boelen |first2=Paul A. |last3=Hek |first3=Karin |last4=Hofman |first4=Albert |last5=Tiemeier |first5=Henning |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=132 |pages=231–8 |pmid=21397336 |issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important part of understanding complicated grief is understanding how the symptoms differ from normal grief. The Mayo Clinic states that with normal grief the feelings of loss are evident. When the reaction turns into complicated grief, however, the feelings of loss become incapacitating and continue even though time passes.&lt;ref name="mayoclinic"&gt;Mayo Clinic Staff, (2011, Sept. 29). In Complicated grief. Retrieved May 20, 2012, from http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/complicated-grief/DS01023&lt;/ref&gt; The signs and symptoms characteristic of complicated grief are listed as "extreme focus on the loss and reminders of the loved one, intense longing or pining for the deceased, problems accepting the death, numbness or detachment… bitterness about your loss, inability to enjoy life, depression or deep sadness, trouble carrying out normal routines, withdrawing from social activities, feeling that life holds no meaning or purpose, irritability or agitation, lack of trust in others."&lt;ref name="mayoclinic" /&gt; The symptoms seen in complicated grief are specific because the symptoms seem to be a combination of the symptoms found in separation as well as traumatic distress. They are also considered to be complicated because, unlike normal grief, these symptoms will continue regardless of the amount of time that has passed and despite treatment given from tricyclic antidepressants.&lt;ref name="Doiannurevmed"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenzweig |first1=Andrew |last2=Prigerson |first2=Holly |last3=Miller |first3=Mark D. |last4=Reynolds |first4=Charles F. |title=Bereavement and Late-Life Depression: Grief and Its Complications in the Elderly |journal=Annual Review of Medicine |volume=48 |issue= |pages=421–8 |year=1997 |pmid=9046973 |doi=10.1146/annurev.med.48.1.421 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study "Bereavement and Late-Life Depression: Grief and its Complications in the Elderly" six subjects with symptoms of complicated grief were given a dose of Paroxetine, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, and showed a 50% decrease in their symptoms within a three-month period. The Mental Health Clinical Research team theorizes that the symptoms of complicated grief in bereaved elderly are an alternative of post-traumatic stress. These symptoms were correlated with cancer, hypertension, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, increased smoking, and sleep impairments at around six months after spousal death.&lt;ref name="Doiannurevmed" /&gt;

A treatment that has been found beneficial in dealing with the symptoms associated with complicated grief is the use of serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors such as Paroxetine. These inhibitors have been found to reduce intrusive thoughts, avoidant behaviors, and hyperarousal that are associated with complicated grief.  In addition psychotherapy techniques are in the process of being developed.&lt;ref name="Doiannurevmed" /&gt;

=== Death of a child ===
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;big&gt;“It is a fearful thing to love&lt;br/&gt; What Death can touch.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;Josephine Jacobson, ''The Instant of Knowing'' (Library of Congress, 1974), 7.&lt;/small&gt;|width=15em|fontsize = 100%|bgcolor = #F0F0F0}}

Death of a child can take the form of a loss in infancy such as [[miscarriage]] or [[stillbirth]]&lt;ref&gt;For a true account of one couples' experience with the stillbirth of their baby, see Brad Stetson, ''Tender Fingerprints: A True Story of Loss and Resolution'', (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; or neonatal death, [[Sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]], or the death of an older child. In most cases, parents find the grief almost unbearably devastating, and it tends to hold greater risk factors than any other loss. This loss also bears a lifelong process: one does not get 'over' the death but instead must assimilate and live with it.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of this process, see Brad Stetson, ''Living Victims, Stolen Lives: Parents of Murdered Children Speak to America'', (Amityville, N. Y.: Belsey, A. (1998). Journalism and Ethics: Can They Co-exist? Matthew Kieran 
(Ed), 1-14. Retrieved from https://link.library.curtin.edu.au/ereserve/DC60130697/0?display=1
 Press, 2003).{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intervention and comforting support can make all the difference to the survival of a parent in this type of grief but the risk factors are great and may include family breakup or suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/emotional_problems_psychologist/psychologist_grief.htm|title=Grief|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Citation needed, because the first reference in this paragraph is not a reliable source, and the second reference is specific for murdered children --&gt;

Feelings of guilt, whether legitimate or not, are pervasive, and the dependent nature of the relationship disposes parents to a variety of problems as they seek to cope with this great loss. Parents who suffer miscarriage or a regretful or coerced abortion may experience resentment towards others who experience successful pregnancies.

=== Suicide ===

Suicide rates are growing worldwide and over the last thirty years there has been international research trying to curb this phenomenon and gather knowledge about who is "at-risk". When a parent loses their child through suicide it is traumatic, sudden and affects all loved ones impacted by this child. Suicide leaves many unanswered questions and leaves most parents feeling hurt, angry and deeply saddened by such a loss. Parents may feel they can't openly discuss their grief and feel their emotions because of how their child died and how the people around them may perceive the situation. Parents, family members and service providers have all confirmed the unique nature of suicide-related bereavement following the loss of a child. They report a wall of silence that goes up around them and how people interact towards them. One of the best ways to grieve and move on from this type of loss is to find ways to keep that child as an active part of their lives. It might be privately at first but as parents move away from the silence they can move into a more proactive healing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = maple|first = M|author2 = Edwards, H|author3 = Minichello V|title = Silenced Voices: hearing the stories of parents bereaved through suicide death of a young adult child|journal = Health and Social care in the community|date = May 2010|volume = 18|issue = 3|pages = 241–248|doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2524.2009.00886.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate = 20 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death of a spouse ===
The death of a spouse is usually a particularly powerful loss. A spouse often becomes part of the other in a unique way:  many [[Widow|widows and widowers]] describe losing 'half' of themselves. The days, months and years after the loss of a spouse will never be the same and learning to live without them may be harder than one would expect.  The grief experience is unique to each person.  Sharing and building a life with another human being, then learning to live singularly, can be an adjustment that is more complex than a person could ever expect.

After a long marriage, at older ages, the elderly may find it a very difficult assimilation to begin anew; but at younger ages as well, a marriage relationship was often a profound one for the survivor.

A factor is the manner in which the spouse died.  The survivor of a spouse who died of an illness has a different experience of such loss than a survivor of a spouse who died by an act of violence.  The grief, in all events, however, can always be of the most profound sort to the widow and the widower.  Emotional unsteadiness, bouts of crying, helplessness and hopelessness are just a small sample of what a widow or widower can expect to face.  Depression and loneliness are very common.  Feeling bitter and resentful are normal feelings for the spouse who is "left behind".  Oftentimes, the widow/widower may feel it necessary to seek professional help in dealing with their new life.

Furthermore, most couples have a division of 'tasks' or 'labor', e.g., the husband mows the yard, the wife pays the bills, etc. which, in addition to dealing with great grief and life changes, means added responsibilities for the bereaved. Immediately after the death of a spouse, there are tasks that must be completed.  Planning and financing a funeral can be very difficult if pre-planning was not completed.  Changes in insurance, bank accounts, claiming of life insurance, securing childcare are just some of the issues that can be intimidating to someone who is grieving.  Social isolation may also become imminent, as many groups composed of couples find it difficult to adjust to the new identity of the bereaved, and the bereaved themselves have great challenges in reconnecting with others. Widows of many cultures, for instance, wear black for the rest of their lives to signify the loss of their spouse and their grief. Only in more recent decades has this tradition been reduced to a period of two years, while some religions such as Christian Orthodox many widows will still continue to wear black for the remainder of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;See Gerald Rochelle, Goodbye: grief from beginning to end, Cambridge House, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death of a parent ===

For a child, the death of a parent, without support to manage the effects of the grief, may result in long-term psychological harm. This is more likely if the adult carers are struggling with their own grief and are psychologically unavailable to the child. There is a critical role of the surviving parent or caregiver in helping the children adapt to a parent's death. Studies have shown that losing a parent at a young age did not just lead to negative outcomes; there are some positive effects. Some children had an increased maturity, better coping skills and improved communication. Adolescents valued other people more than those who have not experienced such a close loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=J|author2=Lloyd-Williams, M|title=Perspectives on the impact of early parent loss in adulthood in the UK: narratives provide the way forward|journal=European Journal of Cancer Care|date=July 2008|pages=317–318|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2354.2008.00963.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an adult child loses a parent in later adulthood, it is considered to be "timely" and to be a normative life course event. This allows the adult children to feel a permitted level of grief. However, research shows that the death of a parent in an adult's midlife is not a normative event by any measure, but is a major life transition causing an evaluation of one's own life or mortality. Others may shut out friends and family in processing the loss of someone with whom they have had the longest relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=H|title=Midlife loss of parents: The Transition from Adult Child to Orphan|journal=Ageing International|year=2004|volume=29|issue=4|pages=351–367|doi=10.1007/s12126-004-1004-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An adult may be expected to cope with the death of a parent in a less emotional way; however, the loss can still invoke extremely powerful emotions. This is especially true when the death occurs at an important or difficult period of life, such as when becoming a parent, at graduation, or at other times of emotional stress. It is important to recognize the effects that the loss of a parent can cause, and to address these effects. For an adult, the willingness to be open to grief is often diminished. A failure to accept and deal with loss will only result in further pain and suffering. “Mourning is the open expression of your thoughts and feelings about the death. It is an essential part of healing.”&lt;ref&gt;Alan D. Wolfelt, Ph.D., “Helping Yourself Heal When a Parent Dies” online at http://griefwords.com/index.cgi?action=page&amp;page=articles%2Fhelping4.html&amp;site_id=2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death of a sibling ===

The loss of a sibling can be a devastating life event. Despite this, sibling grief is often the most disenfranchised or overlooked of the four main forms of grief, especially with regard to adult siblings. Grieving siblings are often referred to as the 'forgotten mourners' who are made to feel as if their grief is not as severe as their parents grief (N.a., 2015).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cancer.net/coping-with-cancer/managing-emotions/grief-and-loss/grieving-loss-sibling/1&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sibling relationship tends to be the longest significant relationship of the lifespan and siblings who have been part of each other's lives since birth, such as twins, help form and sustain each other's identities; with the death of one sibling comes the loss of that part of the survivor's identity because “your identity is based on having them there.”&lt;ref&gt;P. Gill White, Ph.D., “Loss of an Adult Sibling” online at http://www.counselingstlouis.net/page22.html. Accessed September 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sibling relationship is a unique one, as they share a special bond and a common history from birth, have a certain role and place in the family, often complement each other, and share genetic traits. Siblings who enjoy a close relationship participate in each other's daily lives and special events, confide in each other, share joys, spend leisure time together (whether they are children or adults), and have a relationship that not only exists in the present but often looks toward a future together (even into retirement). Surviving siblings lose this “companionship and a future” with their deceased siblings.&lt;ref&gt;P. Gill White, ''Sibling Grief: Healing After the Death of a Sister or Brother '' (iUniverse, 2006), 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Siblings who play a major part in each other's lives are essential to each other. Adult siblings eventually expect the loss of aging parents, the only other people who have been an integral part of their lives since birth, but they do not expect to lose their siblings early; as a result, when a sibling dies, the surviving sibling may experience a longer period of shock and disbelief.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Overall, with the loss of a sibling, a substantial part of the surviving sibling's past, present, and future is also lost. If siblings were not on good terms or close with each other, then intense feelings of guilt may ensue on the part of the surviving sibling (guilt may also ensue for having survived, not being able to prevent the death, having argued with their sibling, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;"Understanding Sibling Loss", CIGNA; ''Sibling Grief'', P.

When a parent or caregiver dies or leaves, children may have symptoms of psychopathology, but they are less severe than in children with major depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.chi.0000215327.58799.05 |title=Childhood Bereavement: Psychopathology in the 2 Years Postparental Death |year=2006 |last1=Cerel |first1=Julie |last2=Fristad |first2=Mary A. |last3=Verducci |first3=Joseph |last4=Weller |first4=Ronald A. |last5=Weller |first5=Elizabeth B. |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=681–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of a parent, grandparent or sibling can be very troubling in childhood, but even in childhood there are age differences in relation to the loss. A very young child, under one or two, may be found to have no reaction if a carer dies, but other children may be affected by the loss.

At a time when trust and dependency are formed, a break even of no more than separation can cause problems in well-being; this is especially true if the loss is around critical periods such as 8–12 months, when attachment and separation are at their height  information, and even a brief separation from a parent or other person who cares for the child can cause distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Mary D. Salter |last1=Ainsworth |first2=Silvia M. |last2=Bell |title=Attachment, Exploration, and Separation: Illustrated by the Behavior of One-Year-Olds in a Strange Situation |journal=Child Development |jstor=1127388 |pmid=5490680 |pages=49–67 |volume=41 |issue=1 |year=1970 |doi=10.2307/1127388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as a child grows older, death is still difficult to fathom and this affects how a child responds. For example, younger children see death more as a separation, and may believe death is curable or temporary. Reactions can manifest themselves in "acting out" behaviors: a return to earlier behaviors such as sucking thumbs, clinging to a toy or angry behavior; though they do not have the maturity to mourn as an adult, they feel the same intensity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} As children enter pre-teen and teen years, there is a more mature understanding.

Adolescents may respond by [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]], or oppositely become "over-achievers": repetitive actions are not uncommon such as washing a car repeatedly or taking up repetitive tasks such as sewing, computer games, etc. It is an effort to stay above the grief.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Childhood loss as mentioned before can predispose a child not only to physical illness but to emotional problems and an increased risk for suicide, especially in the adolescent period.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Children can experience grief as a result of losses due to causes other than death. For example, children who have been physically, psychologically or sexually abused often grieve over the damage to or the loss of their ability to trust. Since such children usually have no support or acknowledgement from any source outside the family unit, this is likely to be experienced as [[disenfranchised grief]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[Relocation (personal)|Relocation]]s can cause children significant grief particularly if they are combined with other difficult circumstances such as neglectful or abusive parental behaviors, other significant losses, etc.&lt;ref name="NITLC Brief Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlcinst.org/Moving.html |title=Moving Can Become Traumatic |last1=Sheppard |first1=Caroline H. |first2=William |last2=Steele |year=2003 |work=Trauma and Loss: Research and Interventions |publisher=Nat'l Inst for Trauma and Loss in Children |accessdate=22 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507104808/http://www.tlcinst.org/Moving.html |archivedate=May 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iowa State University paper by Lesia Oesterreich"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM1529G.pdf|title=Understanding children: moving to a new home|last=Oesterreich|first=Lesia|date=April 2004|publisher=Iowa State University|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Loss of a friend or classmate ====

Children may experience the death of a friend or a classmate through illness, accidents, suicide, or violence.  Initial support involves reassuring children that their emotional and physical feelings are normal.  Schools are advised to plan for these possibilities in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leek Openshaw|first=L|title=School-based support groups for traumatized students|journal=School Psychology International|date=April 2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=163–178|doi=10.1177/0143034311400830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Survivor guilt]] (or survivor's guilt; also called survivor syndrome or survivor's syndrome) is a mental condition that occurs when a person perceives themselves to have done wrong by surviving a traumatic event when others did not. It may be found among survivors of combat, natural disasters, epidemics, among the friends and family of those who have died by suicide, and in non-mortal situations such as among those whose colleagues are laid off.

=== Other losses ===

[[File:FEMA - 29783 - Workers unemployed by the freeze in California.jpg|thumb|right|250px|People who become unemployed, such as these California workers, may face grief from the loss of their job]]

Parents may grieve due to loss of children through means other than death, for example through loss of [[child custody|custody]] in divorce proceedings; legal termination of [[parental responsibility (access and custody)|parental right]]s by the government, such as in cases of [[child abuse]]; through kidnapping; because the child voluntarily left home (either as a runaway or, for overage children, by leaving home legally); or because an adult refuses or is unable to have contact with a parent.  This loss differs from the death of a child in that the grief process is prolonged or denied because of hope that the relationship will be restored.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Grief may occur after the loss of a romantic relationship (i.e. divorce or break up), a vocation, a pet ([[animal loss]]), a home, children leaving home ([[empty nest syndrome]]), sibling(s) leaving home, a friend, a faith in one's religion, etc. A person who strongly identifies with their occupation may feel a sense of grief if they have to stop their job due to retirement, being laid off, injury, or loss of certification. Those who have experienced a loss of trust will often also experience some form of grief.&lt;ref&gt;John W. James and Russell Friedman, ''The Grief Recovery Handbook, 20th Anniversary Expanded Edition'' (William Morrow Paperbacks, 2009), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gradual bereavement ===

Many of the above examples of bereavement happen abruptly, but there are also cases of being gradually bereft of something or someone. For example, the gradual loss of a loved one by Alzheimer's produces a “gradual grief.” &lt;ref&gt;“The Gradual Grief of Alzheimer's” in ''Christianity Today'', 48:2 (Feb 2004). Online at http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/february/8.64.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The author Kara Tippetts described her dying of cancer, as dying “by degrees”: her “body failing” and her “abilities vanishing.”&lt;ref&gt;Kara Tippetts, “By Degrees-Living and Dying” on “Mundane Faithfulness” at http://www.mundanefaithfulness.com/2014/12/29/by-degrees-living-and-dying. Accessed June 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
Milton Crum, writing about gradual bereavement says that “every degree of death, every death of a person’s characteristics, every death of a person’s abilities, is a bereavement.”&lt;ref&gt;Milton Crum, “Bereavement: Long Term” online at http://www.ahpcc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/milton-crum---bereavement.pdf, the website of the Association of Hospice and Palliative Care Chaplains in the UK. Accessed August 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Macklin Intergenerational Institute's Xtreme Aging program has an exercise to simulate gradual bereavement. Lay out three sets of five pieces of note paper on a table. On set #1, write your five most enjoyed activities; on set #2, write your five most valued possessions; on set #3, write your five most loved people. Then “lose” them one by one, trying to feel each loss, until you have lost them all.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Crum, “I’m Old,” 53. Online in the Virginia Theological Seminary Bishop Payne Library at http://www.vts.edu/ftpimages/95/download/Milton%20Crum%20I%20AM%20OLD%202011%5B4%5D_resources.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support ==

=== Professional support ===

Many people who grieve do not need professional help.&lt;ref&gt;”Finding Grief Support That is Right for You” at http://www.griefhealingblog.com/2010/04/finding-grief-support-that-is-right-for.html. Accessed September 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Some, however, may seek additional support from licensed [[psychologist]]s or [[psychiatrist]]s. And support resources available to the bereaved may include [[grief counseling]], professional support-groups or educational classes, and peer-led support groups. In the United States of America, local [[hospice]] agencies may provide a first contact for those seeking bereavement support.&lt;ref&gt;“Interim Hospice Bereavement and Grief” at http://www.interimhealthcare.com/services/hospice/bereavement-services. Accessed September 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to recognize when grief has turned into something more serious, thus mandating contacting a medical professional. Grief can result in depression or alcohol- and drug-abuse and, if left untreated, it can become severe enough to impact daily living.&lt;ref name="nlm"&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|001530|Grief}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recommends contacting a medical professional if "you can’t deal with grief, you are using excessive amounts of drugs or alcohol, you become very depressed, or you have prolonged depression that interferes with your daily life."&lt;ref name="nlm" /&gt; Other reasons to seek medical attention may include: "Can focus on little else but your loved one’s death, have persistent pining or longing for the deceased person, have thoughts of guilt or self-blame, believe that you did something wrong or could have prevented the death, feel as if life isn’t worth living, have lost your sense of purpose in life, wish you had died along with your loved one."&lt;ref name="mayoclinic" /&gt;

Professionals can use multiple ways to help someone cope and move through their grief. Hypnosis  is sometimes used as an adjunct therapy in helping patients experiencing grief.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Hypnotherapy for Traumatic Grief: Janetian and Modern Approaches Integrated |last1= van der Hart |first1=Onno |first2=Paul |last2=Brown |first3=Ronald N. |last3=Turco pages 263-271 |journal=American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis |volume=32 |issue=4 |year=1990 |doi=10.1080/00029157.1990.10402833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypnosis enhances and facilitates mourning and helps patients to resolve traumatic grief.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.onnovdhart.nl/articles/traumaticgrief.pdf |title=Hypnotherapy for Traumatic Grief: Janetian and modern approaches integrated |journal=American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis |last1=Hart |first1=O. |last2=Brown |first2=P. |last3=Turco |first3=R.N. |date=April 1989 |volume=32 |number=4 |pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lichtenthal and Cruess (2010) studied  how bereavement-specific written disclosure had benefits in helping adjust to loss, and in helping improve the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), prolonged grief disorder, and depression. Directed writing helped  many of the individuals who had experienced a loss of a significant relationship. It involved individuals trying to make meaning out of the loss through '''sense making''', (making sense of what happened and the cause of the death), or through [[benefit finding]] (consideration of the global significance of the loss of one's goals, and helping the family develop a greater appreciation of life). This [[meaning-making]] can come naturally for some, but many need direct intervention to "move on".&lt;ref&gt;

=== Support groups ===
* '''Our House''' is a non-profit Grief Support Center located in Southern California that specifically helps children heal from the loss of a parent, sibling, or close relative. It hosts several programs, support groups, and camps to give individuals the space needed to grieve. Camp Erin takes place bi-annually and volunteers do crafts with children. This is also an opportunity for children to meet other children in similar situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourhouse-grief.org/|title=Main Page|website=Our House Grief Support Center|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Griefshare support Group''' -  Griefshare is a Bible-based support group sponsored by many churches across the country for the loss of a loved one. It is a 13-week support group that covers topics such as What is normal, Challenges of grief, Relationships, Why?, Complicating factors,  Stuck in grief, what do I live for now?.  This is a very powerful support group that gives people the tools to move through their grief in a healthy manner.  The 3 components of Griefshare are 1- video's, 2- group discussion time, 3- and workbook.  To find local church's in your area that have this support group

== Cultural differences in grieving ==
{{Main|Mourning}}
Each culture specifies manners such as rituals, styles of dress, or other habits, as well as attitudes, in which the bereaved are encouraged or expected to take part. An analysis of non-Western cultures suggests that beliefs about continuing ties with the deceased varies. In Japan, maintenance of ties with the deceased is accepted and carried out through religious rituals. In the Hopi of Arizona, the deceased are quickly forgotten and life continues on.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Different cultures grieve in different ways, but all have ways that are vital in healthy coping with the death of a loved one.&lt;ref&gt;Santrock, J. W. (2007). ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development''-4th ed. New York : McGraw-Hill Higher Education.{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American family's approach to grieving was depicted in "The Grief Committee", by [[T. Glen Coughlin]]. The short story gives an inside look at how the American culture has learned to cope with the tribulations and difficulties of grief. (The story is taught in the course, The Politics of Mourning: Grief Management in a Cross-Cultural Fiction. Columbia University)&lt;ref&gt;The Politics of Mourning: Grief Management in a Cross-Cultural Fiction, by Rochelle Almeida, 2004 by Rosemont Publishing Company, Associated University Press.{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In those with cognitive impairment ==

Some believe that those who have a high degree of cognitive impairment, such as an intellectual disability, are unable to process the loss of those around them, but this is untrue, those with cognitive impairments such as an intellectual disability are able to process grief in a similar manner to those without cognitive impairment.&lt;ref&gt;McRitchie, R., McKenzie, K., Quayle, E., Harlin, M., Neumann, K. (2014). How adults with intellectual disability experience bereavement and grief: a qualitative exploration. Death Studies, 38(3), 179-185.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main differences between those with an intellectual disability and those without, is typically the ability to verbalize their feelings about the loss, which is why non-verbal cues and changes in behavior become so important, because these are usually signs of distress and expression of grief among this population.&lt;ref&gt;Gilrane-McGarry, U., Taggart, L. (2007). An exploration of the support received by people with intellectual disabilities who have been bereaved. Journal of Research in Nursing, 12(2), 129-144.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important when working with individuals with these such impairments that caregivers and family members meet them where their level of functioning is and allow them to process the loss and grief with assistance given where needed, and not to ignore the grief that these individuals undergo.&lt;ref&gt;McEvoy, J., Smith, E. (2005).

Families perceptions of the grieving process and concept of death in individuals with intellectual disabilities. British Journal of Developmental Disabilities, 51(100, pt.1), 17-25.&lt;/ref&gt; An important aspect of treatment of grief for those with an intellectual disability is family involvement where possible, this can be a biological family or a family created in a group home or clinical setting. By having the family involved in an open and supporting dialogue with the individual it helps them to process. However, if the family is not properly educated on how these individuals handle loss, their involvement may not be as beneficial than those who are educated. The importance of the family unit is very crucial in a soci-cognitive approach to bereavement counseling. In this approach the individual with intellectual disability has the opportunity to see how those around them handle the loss and have the opportunity to act accordingly by modeling behavior. This approach also helps the individual know that their emotions are ok and normal.&lt;ref&gt;Clute, M. (2010). Bereavement interventions for adults with intellectual disabilities: what works. Omega: Journal of Death and Dying, 61(2), 163-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In animals ==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
[[File:August Friedrich Albrecht Schenck - Anguish - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|In [[August Friedrich Schenck]]'s 1878 painting ''Anguish'', held at the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], a grieving ewe mourns the death of her lamb.]]
Previously it was believed that grief was only a human emotion, but studies have shown that other animals have shown grief or grief-like states during the death of another animal. This can occur between bonded animals which are animals that attempt to survive together (i.e. a pack of wolves or mated prairie voles).

=== Mammals ===
Mammals have demonstrated grief-like states, especially between a mother and her offspring. She will often stay close to her dead offspring for short periods of time and may investigate the reasons for the baby's non-response. For example, some [[deer]] will often sniff, poke, and look at its lifeless fawn before realising it is dead and leaving it to rejoin the herd shortly afterwards. Other animals, such as a [[lion]]ess, will pick up its cub in its mouth and place it somewhere else before abandoning it.

When a baby [[chimpanzee]] or [[gorilla]] dies, the mother will carry the body around for several days before it may finally be able to move on without it; this behavior has been observed in other [[primates]], as well. [[Jane Goodall]] has described chimpanzees as exhibiting mournful behavior toward the loss of a group member with silence and by showing more attention to it. And they will often continue grooming it and stay close to the carcass until the group must move on without it. Another notable example is [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]], a gorilla that uses [[sign language]], who expressed sadness and even described sadness about the death of her pet cat, All Ball.

[[Elephant]]s, have shown unusual behavior upon encountering the remains of another deceased elephant. They will often investigate it by touching and grabbing it with their trunks and have the whole herd stand around it for long periods of time until they must leave it behind. It is unknown whether they are mourning over it and showing sympathy, or are just curious and investigating the dead body. Elephants are thought to be able to discern relatives even from their remains. An episode of the acclaimed BBC Documentary [[Life on Earth (TV series)|Life on Earth]] shows this in detail - The elephants, upon finding a dead herd member, pause for several minutes at a time, and carefully touch and hold the dead creature's bones.

=== Birds ===
Some birds seem to lack the perception of grief or quickly accept it- for example, [[Mallard]] hens, although shocked for a moment when losing one of their young to a predator, will soon return to doing what they were doing before the predator attacked. However, some other waterbirds, such as [[Mute swan]]s, are known to grieve for the loss of a partner or cygnet, and are known to engage in pining for days, weeks or even months at a time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theswansanctuary.org.uk/faq.php Frequently Asked Questions about Swans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929170937/http://www.theswansanctuary.org.uk/faq.php |date=September 29, 2015 }}, The Swan Sanctuary&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monogamous animals ===
Another form of grief in animals is when an individual loses its mate; this can be especially brutal when the species is [[monogamous]]. So when a [[pair bonding]] species, such as a [[black-backed jackal]], loses its mate it can be very difficult for it to detach itself from its dead mate.

In [[filmmaking]], a '''guarantee''', or informally a '''"pay-or-play" contract''', is a term in a contract of an actor, director, or other participant that guarantees remuneration if the participant is released from the contract without being responsible.

Studios are reluctant to agree to guarantees but accept them as part of the deal for signing major talent. They also have the advantage of enabling a studio to remove a participant under such a contract, with few legal complications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmslaw.com/articles/art60.htm Navigating The "Pay Or Play" Minefield], ''The Business Of Film'' October 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Pineda's scholarly work develops across the disciplines of global studies, urban history, sociology, politics, [[Objectivist philosophy]] and global history. His research has been published in a variety of social science magazines and journals, including ''The National Catholic Reporter'', ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'', ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'', etc. He has written non-scholarly articles for the online blogs since 2005.

His MSc research is related to the [http://rudar.ruc.dk/handle/1800/12416 Libertarian Free Cities in a global studies focus].  This project is the first academic research in the field of large scale city-building projects in Latin America.  He has also examined how cultural and national identities are constructed through conflicting collective memories in a political and cultural environment defined by historically changing borders and discourses in Guinea-Bissau and India.

After his MA from [[Leipzig University]], Pineda has engaged various areas of research. He writes and publishes on urban history and city-building from a global studies perspective.

Pineda worked as a teacher of Objectivist philosophy with high school and undergraduate students from 2009-11.  He completed three and a half years of study at the [http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=education_academic_index Objectivist Academic Center].  He has lectured at international conferences on the [http://www.atlassociety.org/as/history-capitalism-part-1 history of capitalism] and currently does research related to urban anthropology and global studies at Roskilde University. In 2010 he edited an ebook version of Frederic Bastiat's essay ''[[The Law (1850 book)|The Law]]''.

Pineda is principally interested in how social sciences ideas and approaches can inform global political and global social theory in the study of contemporary politics and contemporary history.

In recent work Pineda has sought to develop an anthropological approach to city-building and [[Saskia Sassen]]'s [[global cities]]. In 2013 he published a project studying [[2012 Guinea-Bissau coup d'état|the military coup]] staged by [[Guinea-Bissau]]’s army on the evening of 12 April 2012 and its linkage to foreign and local drug barons. Pineda proposed in his project that Guinea-Bissau should be recognized as the first legitimate [[narco-state]] in Africa and the world.

Via participation in the yearly held [http://www.atlassociety.org/as/history-capitalism-part-1 Atlas Summit] in Washington, DC, Pineda has also taken an interest in [[Ayn Rand|Ayn Rand's]] philosophy and the methodological applications of Rand's philosophy to the study of global history and the history of capitalism.

His current research in Denmark involves the history of anthropological thought in the study of urbanism, and the connections between global approaches to social theory.

==Teaching career==

'''Gérard Bourgoin''' (born 6 July 1939) is a French businessman, sports chairman and politician. He was the president of the French soccer club [[AJ Auxerre]] from 24 May 2011 to 19 April 2013.

== Career as an entrepreneur ==
Gérard Bourgoin was born in [[Chailley]] in the department of [[Yonne (departement)|Yonne]], the son of a butcher. He began his training course with a CAP (Certificat d'Aptitude Professionnelle) in butchery and then in accounting. By 1966, he created in his native village of Chailley his first poultry factory named La Chaillotine.

The same year, the family company expanded to become one of the biggest French poultry group. During the 1980s, La Chaillotine changed of name into BSA (Bourgoin SA), diversified and developed in the international field. With the buyout of several companies, BSA became the first worldwide leader of fresh poultry with 30% of the national production, 6,600 employees, 30 factories and a gross revenue of 6.5 billion francs.

Faced to industrial and financial difficulties, the group that he manages with his daughter Corinne Bourgoin, named general director in 1996, is in bankruptcy in August 2000. It is dismantled and the successors share the group together. The company Duc continues to utilize the factory of Chailley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Bourgoin ou trente ans de pilotage à vue |url=http://www.lesechos.fr/06/10/2000/LesEchos/18252-155-ECH_bourgoin-ou-trente-ans-de-pilotage-a-vue.htm |work=[[Les Échos (newspaper)|Les Échos]] |date=6 October 2000 |accessdate=18 June 2016 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Bourgoin, le roi du poulet, dépiauté |url=http://www.liberation.fr/futurs/2000/10/07/bourgoin-le-roi-du-poulet-depiaute_339989 |work=[[Libération]] |accessdate=18 June 2016 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career as a football chairman ==
Supporter of the [[AJ Auxerre]] where he was vice-president, he sponsorized the soccer club by the intermediate of his poultry group ("La Chaillotine" from 1978 to 1983 and from 1986 to 1990, then "Duc de Bourgogne" and "Duc" from 1990 to 1996). He was elected in July 2000 president of the [[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] in replacement of [[Noël Le Graët]]. His presidency was not successful and was followed by a strong internal opposition. He was then replaced by [[Frédéric Thiriez]].

In May 2011, with the support of [[Guy Roux]] and [[Jean-Claude Hamel]], he became president of the [[AJ Auxerre]]. He named on 8 June 2011 [[Laurent Fournier]] as a new trainer of the club [[Jean Fernandez]], who had his contract ended and left for the [[AS Nancy]].

'''Jack Euan Henry''' (10 June 1917 – 9 June 2003) was a New Zealand industrialist and company director, and a member of the well-known [[Henry Family]].

==Early life==
Henry was born in [[Rotorua]] on 10 June 1917 to John and Edith Anna Henry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bdmhistoricalrecords.dia.govt.nz/search/search?path=%2FqueryEntry.m%3Ftype%3Dbirths |title=Birth search: registration number 1917/20692 |website=Births, deaths &amp; marriages online |publisher=Department of Internal Affairs |accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Henry was a forester and sawmiller and several of his other children would go on to play significant roles in their respective fields in New Zealand — Jack’s older brothers, the Hon. Sir [[Trevor Henry]] and [[Clive Henry]], would go on to distinguished legal careers.

The road to success, however, was not to be made easy for the family. Similarly to many established New Zealand families of the day, Jack Henry’s childhood would be a difficult one as the country faced the economic challenges of the aftermath of the First World War and the onset of the 1930s Great Depression.

In 1931, at the age of 14, he left school to work in farming in Northland and then entered the New Zealand State Forest Service in 1938. The State Forest Service was a government organization charged with the planting and maintenance of the New Zealand Crown Estate forests.

Following the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Henry joined the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] and saw action in the Pacific theatre. Upon returning to New Zealand, he was appointed as a member of the New Zealand-American Fiordland Expedition which undertook surveying in the remote Fiordland region of Southern New Zealand and attended the [[University of Otago]], where he completed his BSc in Botany.

==The New Zealand Forest Products Ltd years==

In October 1949, he would make the most important step of his career in joining [[New Zealand Forest Products]] Ltd (NZFP), New Zealand’s largest industrial company, as a Forest Administrator of the company’s then {{convert|176000|acre|km2}} of plantations. At this time NZFP faced a crisis following the devastating Taupo forest fires of 1946 and a further 50% of its forest estate had been killed by the deadly Sirex disease. Henry’s solution was to implement pioneering silviculture methods that would see the NZFP forestry estate grow to some {{convert|500000|acre|km2}} within a decade.

Following his successes with the forestry estate, Henry was appointed General Manager of the Forests Division in 1963 by Sir [[David Henry (businessman)|David Henry]] KBE and would go on to sit as a Director of the Company from 1976 to 1986 (serving from 1978 as the Resident Director of the Kinleith milling complex and supervising the Company’s nationwide forestry interests).

He married Betty Henry and they were to have four children. His two eldest sons, Douglas and Trevor, would go on to work for New Zealand Forest Products while his youngest son, [[Brian Henry (lawyer)|Brian Henry]], would join Wilson Henry (now Hesketh Henry), the Auckland law firm of Jack’s brother, the Hon. Sir [[Trevor Henry]].

Jack’s resignation from the Company coincided with the hostile takeover bid that would see New Zealand Forest Products sold to the Australian [[corporate raid]]er, John Elliot. This effectively ended the Henry family’s 110 years of involvement in New Zealand industry.

==Community==

Like many members of the Henry Family before him, Jack’s contributions to the New Zealand community were considerable. He was a member of the New Zealand Forestry Council (1972–1982) and President of the Forest Owners’ Association (1983–1985).

He was also actively involved in scientific fundraising for ''[[Dothistroma]]'' research, [[Frank Newhook]]’s pathology programme, as well as endowing the Chair of Wood Science and providing Visiting Fellows for the School of Forestry at the [[University of Canterbury]].

He was also actively involved in the New Zealand Forestry Institute as a member from 1950 onwards, being made President (1960–1962) and awarded Honorary Membership in 1978.

==Death==
Henry died in Brisbane in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Henry made a huge contribution to forestry | date=13 June 2003 | work=National Business Review | page=39 | first=Graeme | last=Hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15021">'''Job sharing''' or '''work sharing''' is an [[employment]] arrangement where typically two people are retained on a [[part-time]] or reduced-time basis to perform a job normally fulfilled by one person working [[full-time]]. Since all positions are shared thus leads to a net reduction in per-employee income. The people sharing the job work as a team to complete the job task and are equally responsible for the job workload. [[Remuneration|Compensation]] is apportioned between the workers. Working hours, pay and holidays are divided equally. The [[Pay-as-you-earn tax|''pay as you go'']] system helps make deductions for national insurance and [[Superannuation Act 2010|superannuations]] are made as a straightforward percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=1792857|year=1991|author1=Baildam|first1=E.

In 1978 the International Personnel Management Association and the Institute of [[Local government|Local Self Government]] joined with New Ways to Work to sponsor a conference on job sharing in the public sector. More than 80 public agencies sent representatives who were to learn about the experiences in  increasing the number of job sharing projects.  The Part Time Career Employment Act pl 95-437 was passed in 1978 as well. It narrowed the definition of part-time career employment from scheduled work of less than 40 hours a week to scheduled work between 16–32 hours per week.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===2000s===
Job sharing became even more prevalent during the 2000s, as women have succeeded professionally in greater numbers and proportionally seek out alternative work arrangements.&lt;ref name="mckay" /&gt; in the early 2000s, two important factors began to push the job sharing movement. The access to information became increasingly easy to access and the demographics in the workforce began to change. The birth of the World Wide Web made it easier for companies and job share participants to share information through web tools like email, instant messaging, web portals, online databases and multi-user domains, these web tools allowed employees to share work in a more collaborative environment and in an [[asynchrony (computer programming)|asynchronous]] manner. The ever-changing [[demographics]] in the United States also drove the job sharing arrangement. With most of the [[Baby boomers|baby boomer]] generation leaving the United States workforce and retiring, generation X and Y transitioned their lifestyles to an even better balance between family and work. Gender has also impacted the work force demographics: in 2004, women made up 59% of the workforce, with 50% of them in management professional positions.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;7.Crampton, Suzanne; Douglas, Ceasar; Hodge, John; and Mishra, Jitendra (2003) "Job Sharing: Challenges and Opportunities," Seidman Business Review: Vol. 9: Iss. 1, Article 11.Available at: h p://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/sbr/vol9/iss1/11&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bank]]ing, [[insurance]], [[teacher|teaching]] and [[library]] professions are cited as more commonly using job sharing. Some companies that use job sharing include [[New York Life Insurance Company]], [[Fireman's Fund Insurance Company]], and [[Walgreens]] drugstores.&lt;ref name="lussier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/121136-1.html|title=Should your organization use job sharing? - Labor &amp; Employment &gt; Working Hours &amp; Patterns from AllBusiness.com|accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern implementation in pharmacy academia====
In pharmacy academia, job-sharing has been seen as a tool to help encourage and increase female employment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Kelly C.|last2=Finks|first2=Shannon W.|date=2009-11-12|title=Job Sharing for Women Pharmacists in Academia|journal=American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education|volume=73|issue=7|pages=135|issn=0002-9459|pmc=2779650|pmid=19960092|doi=10.5688/aj7307135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female [[pharmacist]]s, compared to males, desire to work part-time earlier on in their careers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is a shortage in the pharmacy field of women due to some employers not providing flexible enough schedules to match the desires of female employees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In academia a similar problem exists, only  20% of full professors were women in 2007 even though 66% of students enrolled in pharmacy schools are women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to retain and increase female employment in the educational field, the [[University of Tennessee]] College of Pharmacy implemented job-sharing in 2007 and has observed a noticeable improvement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==In other countries and areas==
===South Africa===
In South Africa, job sharing has been implemented into the work force. CEO of ''[http://www.kelly.co.za/job-opportunities Kelly]'', South Africa's first job recruitment agency, Kayee Vittee, believes "The more pressure exists in the workplace, the more severe the impact on quality and productivity.  Subsequently, this also has a detrimental effect on employees' wellbeing in general".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rnews.co.za/article/11555/job-sharing-the-answer-to-work-life-balance|title=Job sharing, the answer to work-life balance?|website=www.rnews.co.za|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Solidarity (South African trade union)|Solidarity]]'', a South African trade union that also protects and negotiates workers rights recently developed a social plan that encourages job share as an optimum alternative to full-time jobs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; South Africa's current economy, as of April, 2016, is erratic and unemployment rate is high, so South African citizens unfortunately do not see job share as a solution though it is a beneficial resolution for the current economy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Australia===
Jeremy Hayman, a senior lecturer at [[University of Auckland|Auckland University]] of Technology in [[New Zealand]] specializing in Human Resource Management and Employee Relations collected data and completed a questionnaire from office employees in a large Western Australia university.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anzam.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf-manager/1869_HAYMANJEREMY_104.PDF|title="Flexible Work Arrangements: Exploring the Linkages between Perceived Usability of Flexible Work Schedules and Work/life Balance."|last=Hayman|first=Jeremy|date=October 28, 2016|access-date=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the study was limited to University employees, the primary and recognized finding is that the flexibility provided by job sharing can benefit the integration of work, family and personal life, ultimately providing a better work experience for the employee and a better work environment especially in women aged 30–39.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Though the literature on job share in Australia is largely under represented compared to other developed countries, Hayman's research was more responsive then other preexisting Australian surveys regarding job share. The findings for this study is a great foundation for the future of  job share  in Australia and transforming management practice and work and social life balance.

===Europe===
The United Kingdom has implemented job sharing for a while. In many European countries, the  job sharing arrangement is already a common practice in the workforce. Companies in countries like the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Poland]] have just recently supported job sharing on widespread scale without contractual restrictions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other European countries like [[Slovenia]] and [[Slovakia]] have enforced legitimate job share governing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A European union agency, ''[[European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions|Eurofound]]'', was created by the European council in May 1975 to create better working and living environments for Europeans.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/industrial-relations-dictionary/job-sharing-0|title=Job Sharing|last=|first=|date=June 15, 2015|website=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/|publisher=|access-date=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions|Eurofound]]'' meets annually to decide new policies and adapt to changing times and in 2015, ''Eurofound'' formally defined job sharing as a new form of employment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Caribbean===
Caribbean countries like [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Haiti]] have also begun to practice job sharing. A few of the Caribbean islands in the Western hemisphere that have yet to adapt to the growth in the economy can possibly benefit most from job share. Many of these Caribbean countries and islands have experienced a large number of  their qualified human capital who have moved towards the United States mainland, making the job supply and demand market more inconsistent and the economy more unstable.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=ec1fcb57-ab5b-4e4a-b95c-3c43fa5ea619%40sessionmgr4010&amp;hid=4105|title="Job-Sharing Is Worth Exploring."|last=MONCLOVA,|first=HÉCTOR|date=January 31, 2013|work=|access-date=October 28, 2016|via=EBSCOHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The job share program proves to be a very cost conscious from economic and business prospects.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===
Employees who switch to job share from a full-time job often feel less stressed because they have more time for social and family personal activities. The millennial generation and its ever-changing demographics with more women in the work force has made accomplishing the balance of career and personal life a little harder, hence making job sharing a viable and even preferred solution.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Job share has proven to be extremely convenient to expecting mothers, mothers and caretakers by providing them with a more flexible and less demanding job schedule and load and allowing them to take care of their dependents. Job share employees who don’t have a constant workload and do not need to constantly commute to a job on a daily basis, lowers their stress levels, resulting in healthier lives and work-life balances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrdailyadvisor.blr.com/2013/07/30/job-sharing-the-advantages-and-disadvantages/|title=Job Sharing—The Advantages and Disadvantages|date=30 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For employees seeking more free time for themselves, job sharing may be a way to take back more control of their personal lives.&lt;ref name="javitch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/humanresources/employeemanagementcolumnistdavidjavitch/article170244.html#ixzz0JPCmZEYt&amp;C|title=The Pros and Cons of Job Sharing - Entrepreneur.com|accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Employees who job share frequently attribute their decision to an improvement in "[[quality of life]]".&lt;ref name="javitch" /&gt;

For an employer, job sharing is a benefit because it keeps two valuable employers, thereby increasing intellectual capital and experience.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED504841.pdf|title=Integration Of Learning And Practice For Job Sharing Partnerships|last=Dixon-Krausse|first=Pamela Marie|date=2007|website=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED504841.pdf|publisher=ERIC|access-date=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Job sharing can also prevent future employee burnouts from high stress careers while also making the work atmosphere more enjoyable for all. Successful job share pairing creates a mutual relationship and feel accountable for one another, consequently increasing the accomplishments they achieve together. Studies have shown that net productivity increases when two people share the same 40-hour job, making for a more effective and more than likely profitable workplace for the employer.

===Disadvantages===
Job share can be conflicting if the job share participants/employees are not open to a mutual agreement to distribute everything from salary, workload and time off. Job sharing can also be a disadvantage if the employee cannot afford the part-time wages or benefits. It is also possible that job sharing can make an employee feel less adequate over time and cause less productivity over time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If the job share arrangement is not effective, the transition period to finding another partner could be disruptive and detrimental to the remaining employee. If proper communication and effort does not happen between the job share participants, job share can be a negative experience because the coworkers can not be held accountable to the same expectations, shifting the delicate balance of the job share arrangement.

The disadvantages for employers can start immediately if the employer is not able to successfully match two people to the job share arrangement.This can negatively effect management because of the extra effort and time could take to produce a harmonious job share arrangement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Though job share arrangements generally split the salary in half, training two employees for a job that can be satisfied by one employee could increase administrative costs. Employers may also experience a more difficult time finding prospective employees who genuinely want to participate in job share.&lt;ref name="boston_ap" /&gt;

'''John Bardwell Ebden''' M.L.C. (9 April 1787 - 22 September 1873) was a businessman and politician of the [[Cape Colony]], [[South Africa]]. He dominated Cape Town commerce for over sixty years in the 19th century, and was an unofficial member of the Cape Legislative Council.

An ambitious and combative personality, he was known by the nickname "the storm petrel", due to his reputation of frequently being in fights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geneall.net/U/per_page.php?id=267661|title=John Bardwell Ebden, * 1787 {{!}} Geneall.net|website=www.geneall.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.southafricansettlers.com/?p=4668|title=Ebden, John Bardwell «  South African Settlers|website=www.southafricansettlers.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
JB Ebden was born in 1787 in Suffolk, England, the son of John Ebden, an army surgeon, and Sarah Norman. He received little education, went to sea aged 16 in 1803, and traveled around the Torres Straits and China. 

On a second voyage, this time destined for India, he was shipwrecked off [[Cape Town]]. The 18 year old JB swam ashore in Table Bay (supposedly with a bag of gold in his fist). He received permission to stay at the [[Cape Colony]] in October 1806, and began work as a clerk in the Royal Naval Victualling Office.

In 1808 he married Antoinetta Adriana Kirchmann, the daughter of an influential German immigrant businessman, and the couple had 12 children. He soon left his job and set up a wine merchant business, ''Ebden &amp; Eaton''. Richard Webber Eaton, his partner, was married to Ebden's sister Sarah Ebden in 1814.

He built Belmont (Now St Josephs College), Rondebosch, in 1836. This estate became his home and he lived there for the rest of his life. 

==Business interests==
[[File:JB Ebden - Cape Colony - Copy.jpg|thumb|right|The "storm petrol", JB Ebden, in later life.]]
A man of unusual proactivity, ambition and business acumen, he fought his way to the top of the Cape commercial scene and went on to establish a variety of important enterprises. He founded the Cape of Good Hope Bank and Trade Society, he established the Cape's Commercial Exchange in 1817, he helped to set up the Cape's first insurance company, and he was an early pioneer in the Copperfields. He built up an export trading network with Europe, East Asia and St Helena. 

In all of these enterprises, and others, he came to hold an increasingly dominant position, positions he held until his death. He was President of the CoGH Bank (1838-1873), Chair of the Commercial Exchange and President of the Chamber of Commerce (1861-1873).

The "JB Ebden Prize" and "JB Ebden Scholarships" became institutions in the Cape; the former won by [[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (1894–1948)|J.H. Hofmeyr]] in 1916, and the latter enabled [[Jan Christiaan Smuts]] to graduate from Cambridge.

==Political involvement (1834-1858)==
He soon became involved in Cape politics. In 1834 he became an unofficial member of the Cape's Legislative Council - a relatively powerless body that was nonetheless the closest that the Cape had to a legislature at the time. (However one of the junior clerks in his merchant house was a boy named [[John Molteno]], an Anglo-Italian immigrant who went on to wrest self-government for the Cape and become its first [[Prime Minister]].)

Ebden was one of the leaders of the renowned anti-convict movement, together with Cape Town Mayor [[Hercules Crosse Jarvis]] and Attorney General [[William Porter (attorney-general)|William Porter]], even chairing it in 1849, when he abdicated his Legislative Council seat in protest.&lt;ref&gt;R.F.M. Immelman: ''Men of Good Hope''. CTCC: Cape Town. 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the Cape received an elected parliament in 1854, Ebden was elected to the Legislative Council (upper house) representing the Western Province. He held the seat until 1858. 

==Later life==
JB Ebden acquired the nickname "the Storm Petrel" due to his combative and independent nature, as well as his tendency to be found in the centre of agitations. He had famously acute business acumen, and entirely dominated the Cape's public sphere for several decades. 

He died in 1873 and is buried in Cape Town at the Somerset Road Cemetery.

==Whole World Water==
Launched in 2013, [[Whole World Water]] originated from a collective of creative thinkers who were seeking sustainable solutions for the hospitality and tourism industry. An idea emerged where if hotels, restaurants and spas filtered their own local water, bottled in reusable glass bottles, sold it to their guests and donated part of the proceeds to the Whole World Water Fund, they would not only be raising money for the billion people that do not have access to clean and safe drinking water, they would also be improving their bottom line.

This is a '''list of the fastest-selling product''' superlatives. The definition of "fastest-selling" typically refers to sales results in the first week of a product's release, (i.e., which product had the biggest launch). Sometimes, rather than comparing sales figures relative to time, the target to be reached is fixed (e.g. sales at 5 million units), and the comparison is based upon how many weeks it takes to reach it (e.g. 52 weeks vs. 56 weeks).

{{Contract law}}
'''Lost volume seller''' is a [[term of art|legal term]] in the [[Contract law|law of contracts]].  Such a seller is a special case in contract law.  Ordinarily, a seller whose buyer breaches a contract and refuses to purchase the goods can recover from the breaching buyer only the difference between the contract price and the price for which the seller ultimately sells the goods to another buyer (plus, under some circumstances, incidental damages).

In the case of a lost volume seller, the seller goes on to sell the goods to someone else, usually for the same price.  Under the usual measure of damages, such a seller would have no damages (the contract price less the sale price to the other customer is zero) and the breaching buyer would have no liability.

The objective of the law of contracts with respect to damages is to put the aggrieved party in as good a position as the aggrieved party would have been in if the breaching party had fully performed.  The ordinary measure of damages fails to put the lost volume seller in as good a position as the lost volume seller would have been had the breaching buyer fully performed.  The lost volume seller would have had the profit from two sales if the first buyer had performed instead of the profit from only one sale as a result of the first buyer’s breach.  In such a case, certain law (including Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code in the United States) permits the aggrieved seller to recover the lost profit that the seller would have made had the buyer not breached (plus, under some circumstances, incidental damages).

Lost volume sellers tend to be those whose capacity to sell or to produce or acquire the subject goods is sufficiently large to meet the demands of all customers who seek to buy those goods.  The term generally arises in the context of a breach of contract action in which the selling party seeks to recover against a breaching buyer who repudiates his or her promise to buy.  For a lost volume seller, the failure to make one sale (i.e., due to the buyer's breach) reduces the seller's [[profit (economics)|profits]] by the amount of profit that would accrue from that sale.

==Example==
For example, suppose a [[T-shirt]] maker has 100 T-shirts. If a customer agrees to buy a shirt from the seller and then breaches that agreement (i.e. refuses to take delivery and pay), the seller will likely be able sell the shirt at the same price to the next customer who walks in. Such a seller has no damages by the usual measure (i.e., there is no difference between the contract price with the breaching buyer and the price paid by the buyer who subsequently bought the T-shirt).

However, if that seller has the ability to sell a shirt to any customer that walks in, then the customer who breaches the agreement to buy has prevented the seller from earning profit that the seller would have earned had the agreement been honored.  The initial buyer’s breach has caused the seller to receive the profit from only one sale (the sale to the second buyer) instead of the profit from two sales (the sale to the second buyer plus the sale for which the breaching buyer contracted).

Accordingly, the T-shirt seller can recover from the breaching buyer the profit that the seller would have made on the sale of the T-shirt for which the breaching buyer contracted.

'''Madatally Manji''' (1918 – 9 September 2006) was a [[Kenya]]n industrialist and entrepreneur, best known for founding the House of Manji, a food manufacturing company.

Manji was born in [[Nyeri]], in Kenya's [[Central Province (Kenya)|Central Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tignor |first= Robert L. |year= 1997 |title= ASIAN BUSINESS IN EAST AFRICA ''Madatally Manji: Memoirs of a Biscuit Baron''.

In the subsequent decades his business interests were dominated by food manufacturing. Although best known for biscuits, he also manufactured Weetabix and Buitoni pasta, sweets and, in the early days, bread. Although Kenya was always his base, he also developed businesses in Tanzania, Pakistan and the UK.

He and his wife, Fatima Manji, were renowned for their parties.

==Death==
Madatally Manji, the most publicly famous of the 7 founding brothers, died on 9 September 2006, leaving his wife, Fatima, his children, Julie, Salim and [[Firoze Manji]], his grandchildren, Ambreena, Zia, Ahsan, Tehmeena, Kainde, Sembene, Feisal and Tasneem, his great grandson Rafik, and great nephew Miraz.  Miraz founded a business printing company in Canada called [http://www.tlac.ca TLAC Toronto Printing].

The '''New Program Group''' (NPG) refers to a [[joint-venture]] [[consortium]] formed in August 1984 involving the [[Gannett Company|Gannett]], [[Hearst Television|Hearst]], [[Metromedia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syndication Venture Awaits word on Sale of Metromedia |author= |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1985-05-20/business/8501200162_1_metromedia-tv-metromedia-producers-corp-npg|newspaper=Sun Sentinel |date=20 May 1985 |accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Storer Communications|Storer]] and [[Taft Broadcasting|Taft]] television station&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FRESH FARE PUTS A NEW FACE ON INDEPENDENT STATIONS |author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/02/arts/fresh-fare-puts-a-new-face-on-independent-stations.html?pagewanted=2 |newspaper=New York Times |date=2 February 1986 |accessdate=4 April 2013 |first=Richard W. |last=Stevenson}}&lt;/ref&gt; groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3438">{{short description|Person who creates a new organization}}
An '''organizational founder''' is a person who has undertaken some or all of the work needed to create a new [[organization]], whether this is a [[business]], a [[charitable organization]], a [[governing]] body, a [[school]], a group of [[entertainer]]s, or some other kind of organization. If there are multiple founders, each can be referred to as a '''co-founder'''. If the organization is a business, the founder is usually an [[entrepreneur]]. If an organization is created to carry out charitable work, the founder is generally considered a [[philanthropist]].

==Issues arising from the role==
A number of specific issues have been identified in connection with the role of the founder. The founder of an organization might be so closely identified with that organization, or so heavily involved in its operations, that the organization can struggle to exist without the founder's presence.&lt;ref name="Pakroo"&gt;Peri Pakroo, ''Starting &amp; Building a Nonprofit: A Practical Guide'' (2015), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; "One practical way to cope with overreliance on a founder is to distribute management duties so that others are clearly responsible for important operations. If the founder is on the nonprofit's board, part of the solution is to make sure that the board is diverse, balanced, and regularly infused with new blood".&lt;ref name="Pakroo"/&gt;

===Founder's dilemma===
In some instances, the desire of the founder to maintain control over the organization becomes a problem because, when an entrepreneurial organization is successful, "[i]t outgrows the ability of the founder, or even of a small team around the founder, to control".&lt;ref&gt;Colin White, ''Strategic Management'' (2004), p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' identified this problem as the founder's dilemma, noting that in most successful companies, the founder is pushed out of control by investors within the first few years after the formation of the company.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noam T. Wasserman]], "[https://hbr.org/2008/02/the-founders-dilemma The Founder's Dilemma]", ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' (February 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, a company may have multiple founders, and a prominent source of conflict can be disagreements between these founders as the company evolves.&lt;ref&gt;Dharmesh Shah, "Avoid Co-Founder Conflict", in Brad Feld, David Cohen, ''Do More Faster: TechStars Lessons to Accelerate Your Startup'' (2010), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts must be made to balance the responsibilities of each so that no one founding member feels involuntarily diminished in their role relative to the others.

===Forgotten founder===
Another problem that can arise is that of the forgotten founder, a person who participates early on in the formation of an enterprise, but leaves or is ousted before it achieves success, and then returns to claim a legal right to [[equity (finance)|equity]], [[intellectual property]], or some other fruits of that success.&lt;ref name="Bagley"&gt;Constance E. Bagley, ''Managers and the Legal Environment: Strategies for the 21st Century'' (2012), p. 650.&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid this problem, it is advised that the entity "[[Incorporation (business)|incorporate]] early and issue [[shares]] that are subject to vesting over time".&lt;ref name="Bagley"/&gt;

'''Personal selling''' occurs when a sales representative meets with a potential client for the purpose of transacting a [[Sales|sale]]. Many sales representatives rely on a sequential sales process that typically includes nine steps. Some sales representatives develop scripts for all or part of the sales process. The sales process can be used in face-to-face encounters and in [[telemarketing]].

==Definition==

Personal selling can be defined as "the process of person-to-person communication between a salesperson and a prospective customer, in which the former learns about the customer's needs and seeks to satisfy those needs by offering the customer the opportunity to buy something of value, such as a good or service."&lt;ref&gt;Cant, M.C. and van Heerde, C.V., ''Personal Selling,'' Juta, 2004, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The term may also be used to describe a situation where a company uses a sales force as one of the main ways it communicates with customers.

==Brief history==

The earliest forms of exchange involved bartering systems. However, the advent of coinage enabled exchange to occur more efficiently and over much larger distances. The earliest references to selling, involving coin-based exchange, comes from [[Herodotus]] who noted that "The [[Lydians]] were the first people we know of to use a gold and silver coinage and to introduce the retail trade."  &lt;ref&gt;Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, "A History of Marketing Thought,"  in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Barton A Weitz and Robin Wensley (eds), Sage, 2003, p. 41, Online: https://www.researchgate.netpublication235362475_A_History_of_Marketing_Thought&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that selling and buying, originated in the 7th century BCE, in the area now known as Turkey. From there, selling spread along Mediterranean, and then diffused throughout the civilized world.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, "A History of Marketing Thought,"  in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Barton A Weitz and Robin Wensley (eds), Sage, 2003, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The Socratic philosophers expressed some concerns about the new type of selling in around the 4th century BCE. Their commentary was primarily concerned with potential disruption of the more social aspects of selling. Traditional forms of exchange encouraged a social perspective - emphasising the social bonds that united members of a society. For example, during periods of drought or famine, individuals shared in the plight of their neighbours. However, the advent of this new form of selling encouraged a focus on the individual such that in times of scarcity, sellers raised their prices.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, "A History of Marketing Thought,"  in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Barton A Weitz and Robin Wensley (eds), Sage, 2003, pp 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Medieval period, trade underwent further changes. Localised trading based on transactional exchange and bartering systems was slowly transformed as transportation improved and new geographic markets were opened.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., ''The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century,'' Berkely, CA, University of California Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; From the 11th century, the [[Crusades]] helped to open up new trade routes in the Near East, while the adventurer and merchant, [[Marco Polo]] stimulated interest in the far East in the 12th and 13th centuries. Medieval merchants began to trade in exotic goods imported from distant shores including spices, wine, food, furs, fine cloth, notably silk, glass, jewellery and many other luxury goods. As trade between countries or regions grew, trade networks became more complex and different types of sellers filled in the spaces within the network. During the thirteenth century, European businesses became more permanent and were able to maintain sedentary merchants in a home office and a system of agents who operated in different geographic markets.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, M. and Lee, J., "The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective," ''Business History Review,'' Vol 85, Spring, 2011, doi:10.1017/S0007680511000018, pp 22–26&lt;/ref&gt; Exchange was often conducted at arm's length, rather than face-to-face.

Local market traders and itinerant peddlers continued to supply basic necessities, but permanent retail shops gradually emerged from the 13th century, especially in the more populous cities.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, N. and Hubbard, E., ''The Buildings of England: Cheshire'' Penguin, 1978, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; By the 17th century, permanent shops with more regular trading hours were beginning to supplant markets and fairs as the main retail outlet. Provincial shopkeepers were active in almost every English market town. These shopkeepers sold a very broad range of general merchandise, much like a contemporary general store.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England,'' Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p,. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Large business houses involved in import and export often offered additional services including finance, bulk-breaking, sorting and risk-taking. In the 17th century, the public began to make mental distinctions between two types of trader; local traders (Dutch: ''meerseniers'') which referred to local merchants including bakers, grocers, sellers of dairy products and stall-holders, and the merchants (Dutch: ''koopman''), which described a new, emergent class of trader who dealt in goods or credit on a large scale. With the rise of a European merchant class, this distinction was necessary to separate the daily trade that the general population understood from the rising ranks of merchants who operated on a world stage and were seen as quite distant from everyday experience.&lt;ref&gt;Honig, E.A., ''Painting &amp; the Market in Early Modern Antwerp,'' Yale University Press, 1998, pp 6-10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 18th century England, large industrial houses, such as [[Wedgewood]], began mass-producing certain goods such as pottery and ceramics and needed a form of mass distribution for their products. Some [[peddler]]s were employed by these industrial producers to act as a type of travelling sales representative, calling on retail and wholesale outlets in order to make a sale.&lt;ref&gt;Tadajewski, M. and Jones, D.G.B., "Historical research in marketing theory and practice: a review essay," ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vol. 30, No. 11-12, 2014 [Special Issue: Pushing the Boundaries, Sketching the Future], pp 1239-1291&lt;/ref&gt; In England, these peddlers were known as ''Manchester men'' because of the prevalence of the practice in the sale of cotton cloth manufactured in [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;Silver, A.W., ''Manchester Men and Indian Cotton, 1847-1872,'' pp 54-58 and p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Employed by a factory or entrepreneur, they sold goods from shop to shop rather than door to door and were thus operating as a type of wholesaler or distribution intermediary.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, M. and Lee, J., "The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective," ''Business History Review,'' Vol 85, Spring, 2011, doi:10.1017/S0007680511000018, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  They were the precursors to the field sales representative.

==Selling roles and situations==

Sales activity can occur in many types of situations. Field representatives call on clients, who are typically business clients; door-to-door sales teams call on householders, sales staff may work in a [[retail]] or [[Wholesaling|wholesale]] environment where sales personnel attend to customers by processing orders or sales may occur in a telemarketing environment where the sales person makes telephone calls to prospects. In terms of number of transactions, most selling occurs at the retail level; but in terms of value, most selling occurs at the high-end business-to-business level.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, P.E., "George E Brenkert- Marketing Ethics," [Book Review], ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews,'' 24 May 2009 &lt;Online:http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/marketing-ethics/&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of sales roles can be identified:
* ''Order takers'' refers to selling that occurs primarily at the wholesale or retail levels. Order processing involves determining the customer needs, pointing to inventory that meets the customer needs and completing the order.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, L.E. and Kurtz, K.L., ''Contemporary Marketing,'' Stamford, CT, Cengage, 2014, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Order getters'' refers to the in-field sales activity where a sales representative travels to the client's home or work place to makes a [[sales presentation]] in order to win new business or to maintain relations with existing clients.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, L.E. and Kurtz, K.L., ''Contemporary Marketing,'' Stamford, CT, Cengage, 2014, p. 580&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Missionary selling'' is often seen as a sales support role. The missionary sales person distributes information about products or services, describes product attributes and leaves materials but does not normally close the sale. The missionary sales person often prepares the way for a field sales person. For example, a pharmaceutical sales representative may call on doctors and leave samples, manufacturer information such as results of clinical trials, copies of relevant journal articles etc. in an effort to persuade doctors to prescribe a medication or course of treatment.
* ''Cold calling'' refers to a situation when a sales representative telephones or visits a customer without a prior appointment. [[Cold calling]] is often considered to be the most challenging of the sales activities. In a cold calling situation, the sales representative is likely to be more conscious of the client's time, and may seek to condense the sales process by combining the approach and the sales presentation into a single step.&lt;ref&gt;Boyan, L., ''Successful Cold Call Selling,'' American Management Association, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Relationship selling'' (also known as ''consultative selling'') refers to a sales practice that involves building and maintaining interactions with customers in order to enhance long term relationships. Relationship selling often involves a problem solving approach where the sales representative acts in a consultative role and becomes a partner in the client's problem-solving exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, C.W.L., Hair, J.F. and McDaniel, C., ''Marketing,'' South-Western, 2011, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Relationship selling is often found in high-tech selling environments.

==The sales process==

[[File:Steps in sales process.jpg|thumb|Steps in the sales process]]
The first text to outline the steps in the selling process was published in 1918 by Norval Watkins.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, W.A., ''Birth of a Salesman: The Transformation of Selling in America,'' p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; The basic steps, which have changed only a little since Watkins first proposed them, are prospecting, qualifying leads, preapproach, approach, need assessment, presentation, meeting objections, closing the sale and following up.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, L.E. and Kurtz, K.L., ''Contemporary Marketing,'' Stamford, CT, Cengage, 2014, p. 583&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Steve Jobs Presentation 1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Steve Jobs delivers one of his impressive sales presentations]]
:''Prospecting''–Identifying prospects or prospecting occurs when the sales person seeks to identify leads or prospects (i.e., people who are likely to be in the market for the offer). To identify prospects, sales representatives might use a variety of sources such as business directories (for corporate clients), commercial databases or mailing lists or simply look at internal records such as lists of lapsed customers. The aim of prospecting is to increase the likelihood that sales staff spend time with potential clients who have an interest in the product or service.

:''Qualifying leads''–After identifying potential customers, the sales team must determine whether prospects represent genuine potential customers. This part of the process is known as qualifying leads, or leads who are likely to buy. Qualified leads are those who have a need for the product, a capacity to pay and a willingness to pay for the product, and are willing to be contacted by the salesperson.&lt;ref name="Spiro2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=Management of a Sales Force|year=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin|author=Spiro, Roseann|edition=12th|author2=Gregory Rich |author3=Stanton, William }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Pre-approach''–Refers to the process of preparing for the presentation. This consists of customer research, goal planning, scheduling an appointment and any other tasks necessary to prepare for the sales presentation.

:''Approach''–Refers to the stage when the salesperson initially meets with the customer. Since first contact leaves an impression on the buyer, professional conduct, including attire, a handshake, and eye contact, is advised.&lt;ref name="Spiro2008" /&gt;

:''Need assessment''–An important component of the sales presentation is the assessment of the customer's needs.  Salespeople should evaluate the customer based on the need for the product. Sales representatives typically ask questions designed to reveal the prospective client's current situation, the source of any problems, the impact of the problems, the benefits of the solution, the client's prior experience with the brand or the category, the prospect's general level of interest and readiness to purchase.&lt;ref name="Spiro2008" /&gt; In the case of corporate clients, it may be necessary to ascertain any limitations on the prospect's authority to make a purchase (e.g. financial restrictions).

:''Sales presentation''–Once the salesperson knows the needs, he or she is ready for the presentation. Sales representatives often follow the [[AIDA (marketing)|AIDA]] model, which allows them to lead the prospect through the standard stages of the [[buyer decision process|purchase decision process]]. The steps in the AIDA process are to grab the customer’s '''A'''ttention, ignite '''I'''nterest, create '''D'''esire, and inspire '''A'''ction (AIDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Alex |url=http://www.udel.edu/alex/chapt20.html |title=Chapter 20, Personal Selling and Sales Management, Class Notes |deadurl=no |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The salesperson can do this through [[product demonstration]]s and presentations that show the features, advantages and benefits of the product.

:''Handling objections''–After the presentation, the sales person must be ready to handle any objections. Customers who are interested will voice their concerns, usually in one of four ways. They might question the price or value of the product, dismiss the product/service as inadequate, avoid making a commitment to buy, or refuse because of an unknown factor.&lt;ref name="Spiro2008"/&gt; Salespeople should do their best to anticipate objections and respectfully respond to them.

:''Closing''–When the sales person feels that the prospect is ready, they will seek to gain commitment and close the sale. If the sales person is unsure about the prospect's readiness to buy, they might consider using a 'trial close.' The salesperson can use several different techniques to close the sale; including the ‘alternative close’, the ‘assumptive close’, the ‘summary close’, or the ‘special-offer close’, among others.

:''Follow-up''–Finally, the salesperson must remember to follow up after the sale has been concluded. Following up will ensure customer satisfaction and help establish a relationship with the customer.

==Sales scripts==

[[File:A French itinerant medicine vendor on stage selling his ware Wellcome L0032279.jpg|thumb|Historically, itinerant medicine salesmen used tightly written scripts that induced audiences to buy]]
The use of tightly written sales scripts has been known for hundreds of years. Itinerant medicine salesmen were known to use sales scripts in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Experienced sales representatives soon recognise that specific words and phrases have the capacity to elicit desirable behaviours on the part of the prospect. Research studies can also be carried out to determine the most effective words/phrases or the optimal sequence of words/phrases for use in effective sales scripts. A number of research studies have focussed on the types of the use of verbal persuasive techniques that can be used to convince prospects such as information exchange, the use of recommendations, requests, promises, or ingratiation.&lt;ref&gt;Fennis, B.M. and Stel, M., "The Pantomime of Persuasion: Fit Between Nonverbal Communication and Influence Strategies," ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,'' 2011, doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2011.02.01&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has focused on influence techniques employed. Well-known examples include the:

:Door-In-The-Face–technique (DITF): where the target request is presented as a concession to an unreasonably large initial request&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B., Vincent, J. E., Lewis, S. K. Catal
an, J., Wheeler, D., &amp; Darby, B.L., "Reciprocal concessions procedure for inducing compliance: The Door-In-The-Face technique," ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,'' Vol. 31, pp 206-215&lt;/ref&gt;

:Disrupt-Then-Reframe–technique (DTR): where a conventional sales script is interrupted by a subtle, odd element (i.e., a disruptive element) and then followed by a persuasive phrase that concludes the script (i.e., “reframing”)&lt;ref&gt;Price-Davis, B.  and Knowles, E.S., "A Disrupt-Then-Reframe Technique of Social Influence,"  ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,'' Vol. 76, No. 2,  1999, pp 192-199&lt;/ref&gt;

Once identified, these words, phrases and techniques can be used to build highly effective sales scripts that are known to work.&lt;ref&gt;Niblick, J., ''The Profitable Consultant: Starting, Growing, and Selling Your Expertise,'' Wiley, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The most effective sales scripts can be codified and used by other sales persons or in sales training.

[[File:Borstelkoopman op de fiets - A brush salesman and his bicycle (4416872302).jpg|thumb|A brush salesman and his bicycle in the 1950s]]
Many sales scripts are designed to move the prospect sequentially through the cognitive, affective and behavioural stages of the purchase decision process and are designed around the AIDA model (attention →interest →desire →action). Most sales representatives include a greeting, closing and [[Call to action (marketing)|call to action]] in their scripts. A ''call to action'' (CTA) is simply an instruction to the prospect designed to prompt an immediate response. It often involves the use of an [[imperative verb]] such as "try it now" or  "find out more."&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, B., ''CALL TO ACTION: Secret Formulas to Improve Online Results,'' Nashville, Tennessee, Thomas Nelson, 2006, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of calls-to-action might provide consumers with strong reasons for purchasing immediately such an offer that is only available for a limited time, e.g. 'Limited stocks available' or a special deal usually accompanied by a time constraint, e.g. 'Order before midnight to receive a free gift with your order'. The key to a powerful call-to-action is to provide consumers with compelling reasons to purchase promptly rather than defer purchase decisions.

Sales representatives also learn to recognise specific verbal and non-verbal cues that potentially signal the prospect's readiness to buy. For instance, if a prospect begins to handle the merchandise, this may indicate a state of buyer interest. Clients also tend to employ different types of questions throughout the sales process. General questions such as, "Does it come in any other colours (or styles)? indicate only a moderate level of interest. However, when clients begin to ask specific questions, such as "Do you have this model in black?" then this indicates that the prospect is approaching readiness to buy.&lt;ref&gt;Cant, M.C. and van Heerden, C.H., ''Personal Selling,'' Juta Academic, 2008, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; When the sales person believes that the prospective buyer is ready to make the purchase, a ''trial close'' might be used to test the waters. A trial close is simply any attempt to confirm the buyer's interest in finalising the sale. An example of a trial close, is "Would you be requiring our team to install the unit for you?" or "Would you be available to take delivery next Thursday?"

Sales scripts are used for both inbound and outbound sales. Sales scripts are commonly used in cold calling, especially phone-based cold calling such as telemarketing (outbound selling) and can also be found in chat-based customer care centres (inbound calling). In such cases, the sales script might be confined to a simple list of talking points that the sales person uses as a reference during their conversation with the prospect.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, P., "What are Sales Scripts?," Tenfold Blog, &lt;Online: https://www.tenfold.com/what-is/sales-scripts-definition&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===

[[File:The Rawleigh Man.JPG|thumb|By 1915, an estimated 2,000 "Rawleigh men" distributed Rawleigh products while visiting approximately 20,000 customers daily]]
Some sales pitches are entirely scripted while others are only partially scripted allowing the individual sales representatives the flexibility to vary the presentation according to their assessment of the client's needs and interests. However, most effective sales representatives develop scripts for handling common objections and almost always have a number of different trial closes at hand.

There are three broad types of sales script:&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, M. R., Surprenant, C. F., Czepiel, J.A. and Suprenant, C.F. "A Role Theory Perspective on Dyadic Interactions: The Service Encounter” (1991) in Bateson, J, Managing Services Marketing: Text, Cases and Readings, Dryden, Orlando, Fl, pp 106- 122&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prescribed scripts====

Prescribed scripts are highly detailed scripts which specify precise phrases to be used in given situations. Prescribed scripts are widely used in a variety of contexts including direct selling, market research, fast food service.

The main advantages of prescribed scripts are:
* can enable speedy transactions
* provides uniform delivery. 
The main disadvantages of a prescribed script are:
* tendency for the delivery to become robotic and lacking in authenticity

====Goal-driven scripts====

Goal driven scripts are more flexible. This type of script defines the goals for each type of transaction and allow employees to use their own phrases during the encounter. Provided that employees have a clear picture of the goals and purpose, goal-driven scripts can appear more natural and authentic. However the use of goal-driven scripts requires employees with well developed communication skills.

====Hybrid approach====

The hybrid approach offers a choice within a range of scripts. This approach is neither prescribed nor totally flexible. It provides a range of scripts from which employees select an option with which they feel comfortable.

'''Philip Ulric Strengberg''' (2 August 1805 &amp;ndash; 8 October 1872) was a prominent business man in [[Jakobstad]] and the majority owner of the Ph. U. Strengberg tobaccy factory, which he co-owned together with [[Wilhelm Schauman]].

==Life==
Strengberg was born in [[Sievi]], Finland and entered an [[Apologist]] school in Uleåborg (Oulu) at the age 13, graduating in 1820. He then worked as a sales clerk for the widow of local merchant Kilian Malm in Jakobstad and was granted the priviligies of merchant on 5 May 1828. He soon became one of the leading merchants in Jakobstad. He was involved in mainly export trade, shipping and the management of a local saw mill.

He married Ulrica Charlotta Thelin on 7 June 1829, but the marriage was childless. Ulrica was born in Jakobstad on 18 February 1799 to the local merchant Johan Thelin and his wife Anna Margareta Häggström.

During the years 1842 until 1848 Strengberg purchased the majority of shares in the tobacco factory in Jakobstad (founded in 1762). This proved to be the boost that the stagnant tobaccy industry had been waiting for, and the business was soon booming under the new name of ''"Ph. U. Strengberg &amp; C:o Tobaks-Fabrik"''. He was a member of the [[Municipality|municipal court]] from 1837 until 1858, and from 1843 an [[alderman]] of the [[city council]]. He died in Jakobstad in 1872, leaving behind a fortune of 526 000 [[Finnish mark|Finnish Marks]].

==Tobacco factory==
[[File:Strengberg tobacco factory in Jakobstad.jpg|270px|right|thumb|Strengberg tobacco factory.]]
The '''Strengberg tobacco factory''' was one of the largest and most successful tobacco firms in Finland, situated in the Ostrobothnian town Jakobstad. From this position of strength, it was also (probably) the first Finnish company to open a subsidiary abroad, in the Swedish town of [[Härnösand]] in 1903. The severe competition between the Finnish tobacco producers (such as ''P.C. Rettig &amp; Co'' and ''Tollander &amp; Klaerich'') led to rapid technological development in the branch. By the 1840s, Strengberg had started to install machinery and industrialise artisan production. Cutting machines were acquired and installed in the 1850s, and the first steam engine to drive the cutting and pressing machines were acquired in 1863, and in 1900, the factory employed around 1000 people in Jakobstad.

The production in Härnösand, Sweden had started on a small scale in 1903, but expanded rapidly and Ph. U. Strengberg &amp; C:o became a significant producer of cigarettes in Sweden. Even during the first full year of operations in 1904, Strengberg produced 17 per cent of all Swedish cigarettes. In 1908 Strengberg was the second largest cigarette producer in Sweden. Its share of cigarette production reached a top figure in 1911 when Strengberg accounted for nearly half of the cigarettes produced in Sweden. The success of the Strengberg firm can, first and foremost, be attributed to the use of modern production methods in cigarette production.

The Finnish tobacco producers’ Swedish operations came to an end with the foundation of the Swedish tobacco monopoly AB Svenska Tobaksmonopolet in 1914. For Strengberg this was a harsh blow, as production in Härnösand had been quite profitable. Strengberg opened a subsidiary in [[Oslo]], Norway in 1912. However, this operation never met with financial success, and the subsidiary was closed down in 1928. The subsidiaries in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark and [[Lübeck]], Germany, met with similar fates.

In 1940, [[P.C. Rettig &amp; Co]] bought the share majority of Ph. U. Strengberg &amp; Co Ab in Jakobstad, operating tobacco factories both in Turku and Jakobstad. The companies were fully merged to form [[Rettig-Strengberg|Oy Rettig-Strengberg Ab]] in 1976. In the mid-1990s, the factory was bought by [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]], who later sold it to [[Swedish Match]]. The factory was closed down in 1998, and the production was moved to the Swedish Match factories in Belgium.

'''Sidney (or Sydney) Stanley''' (''né'' '''Solomon Wulkan''', alias '''Solomon Koszyski''',&lt;ref name="wb161"&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''161&lt;/ref&gt; alias '''Stanley Rechtand''',&lt;ref name="WB136"&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''136&lt;/ref&gt; later '''Schlomo ben Chaim'''&lt;ref name="WB246"&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''246&lt;/ref&gt;) (1899/1905&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) at ''p.''63 claims that Stanley was 43 at the time of the tribunal but at ''pp''136–137 he suggests that he was 14 in 1913&lt;/ref&gt; – 1969) was a Polish ''émigré'' to the UK who became a dubious businessman of precarious ethics before claiming to be a ''contact man'', able to influence politicians and civil servants in return for cash bribes, claims that led to a great scandal and investigation by the [[Lynskey tribunal]] of 1948. There is also evidence that Stanley [[espionage|spied]] against the UK for the armed nationalist activist [[Irgun]] organisation. Stanley was ordered deported, but had lost his Polish nationality, and as a result was a [[statelessness|stateless person]]. Stanley was then placed under heavy restrictions and police surveillance. In 1949, he evaded police and fled to [[France]] and thence to [[Israel]], where he was granted citizenship through right-of-return. There he lived out the remainder of his life in relative obscurity.

==Early life==
Stanley was the eldest son of twelve children born in Poland. He had emigrated to Britain with his father&lt;ref name="dispatch"&gt;Account of his wife, published in the ''Sunday Dispatch'' 30 January 1949, quoted in Wade Baron (1966), ''p.''237&lt;/ref&gt; in 1913,&lt;ref name="WB136"/&gt; the rest of the family following when the two had settled in [[Aldgate]].&lt;ref name="dispatch"/&gt; He later said he was born in [[Oświęcim]]. He was granted a [[Polish passport]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron 1966) ''p.''242&lt;/ref&gt; He gave a fairly ambiguous account of his early career but seems to have been employed from the age of 14 in garment sales and trading, especially in government contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''136–137&lt;/ref&gt; He took his mother's name Koszyski.&lt;ref name="wb161"/&gt;

He married his first wife Kate Zeitlin after World War I and the couple lived in [[Stoke Newington]] with Zeitlin's mother.&lt;ref name="dispatch"/&gt;

Stanley was made bankrupt in 1927, under the name Wulkan, and again in 1936, under the name Blotz.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''143&lt;/ref&gt; A [[deportation]] order was made against him in 1933 for [[conspiracy to defraud]]&lt;ref name="wb161"/&gt; though he proved untraceable.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''243&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1946, he had established himself in a luxurious seven-room apartment in [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meeting with Gibson==
According to Stanley, in 1946, he was returning by train from a business trip to [[Manchester]] when the guard enquired whether he would make up a foursome for a game of [[solo whist]] with some other men. He consequently met [[George Gibson (trade unionist)|George Gibson]], a director of the [[Bank of England]].&lt;ref name="WB139"&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''139&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's account is that his party had asked Stanley for small change for their game and that Stanley had recognised Gibson through a common acquaintance, Cyril Ross.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''170&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson met Stanley several more times on the Manchester train before, in April 1947, running into him in the company of Marcus Wulkan, an American who had been involved in economic assistance to Britain during World War II and who was slightly known to Gibson. Stanley represented Wulkan as being his brother. Gibson invited the two to dinner, where they now met junior government minister [[John Belcher (politician)|John Belcher]], and after that Gibson visited Stanley's Park Lane home frequently.&lt;ref name="WB139"/&gt; At a subsequent dinner party attended by [[Morgan Phillips]] and four other [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MPs, Stanley became involved in raising finance for the [[anti-communist]] "Freedom and Democracy" organisation,&lt;ref name="WB139"/&gt; though he appears to have done little more than donate a cheque for £50 which was dishonoured.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''180&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1946, Stanley approached fur-dealer Cyril Ross, the common acquaintance from the Manchester train, with a business proposition. Ross said that he would be interested in a multiple store such as J.&amp;nbsp;Jones of Manchester. Stanley agreed to pursue the matter and also to get permission for flotation as a public company from the [[Capital Issues Committee]]. Stanley, somewhat prematurely, offered a directorship in J.&amp;nbsp;Jones to Gibson who, owing to his position, turned it down. Ross had originally intended that Stanley would be remunerated by equity in the new company but he ultimately lost trust, largely because of the extortionate expenses that Stanley regularly claimed, and agreed only to a fee for the work.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''126–127&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1948, Gibson introduced [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] [[Glenvil Hall]] to Stanley, believing that Marcus Wulkan might be in a position to arrange an American loan of £250 million to the UK government. At a dinner for Gibson on 23 March, Stanley ensured that he sat next to [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Ernest Bevin]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrew 2009 p.361"&gt;Andrew (2009) ''p.''361&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertaining Mr Belcher==
Belcher was keen to network with industrialists and was flattered by Stanley's apparent solicitude. The two rapidly became friends and Stanley offered Belcher use of a house that he had rented at [[Margate]] for the duration of the 1947 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] conference. Belcher took the opportunity to invite his wife, children and mother for a two-week vacation, and it soon became apparent to Stanley that the party was too large for his rented house. Stanley booked the party into a hotel in [[Cliftonville]] and, though Belcher at this point became nervous, Stanley insisted and prevailed. In the end, Belcher indulged himself thoroughly and the friendship between the pair became increasingly intimate.&lt;ref name="Andrew 2009 p.361"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''16–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley pressed more and more gifts of food and wine, a gold cigarette-case and ultimately a suit of a quality beyond the means, and clothing coupons, of a junior minister in post-war Britain. Stanley was full of rather vague industrial and commercial propositions that never came to any resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''23&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley also paid for suits for Gibson and [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Minister of Works]] [[Charles Key]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''121&lt;/ref&gt;

Several people warned of Stanley's unreliability including [[Hugh Dalton]], [[Leonard Joseph Matchan]] and Morgan Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spying==
In November 1947 an [[MI5]] report recorded that a man named "Stanley" had been passing information to Irgun from cabinet minister [[Manny Shinwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew (2009) ''p.''360&lt;/ref&gt; Shinwell certainly knew Stanley whom he had approached for help in finding employment for his son Ernie, and Stanley had obtained information on the disbandment of the [[Transjordan Frontier Force]] from some government source.&lt;ref name="Andrew 2009 p.361"/&gt;

==Football pools==
Harry Sherman was a director of [[Shermans Pools Ltd]] of [[Cardiff]], a [[football pools]] promoter. The post-war paper-shortage had led the government to make an allocation of paper to the [[Football Pool Promoters' Association]] and to leave the association to share it among its members.&lt;ref&gt;Hansard,18 November 1947 adjournment debate 18 November 1947 (football pools reorganization)&lt;/ref&gt; Sherman believed his share to be unjust and took every opportunity to canvass anyone who could influence his case or find him an alternative source. However, Sherman's record of complaints of his misconduct in a closely regulated industry led the [[Board of Trade]] to start a [[prosecution]] against the company in January 1948. The [[magistrate]] who heard the case died before giving judgment and Sherman and his legal team galvanised into action to prevent a new hearing. Belcher was the minister responsible and was inundated with protests.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley contacted Sherman sometime in May, claiming to have already discussed the paper problems with Sherman's brother.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, D. "[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Generous+Sherman+brothers+should+not+be+forgotten%3B+Time+to+remember.-a080221051|Generous Sherman brothers should not be forgotten; Time to remember]", ''South Wales Echo'', 19 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, Stanley introduced Sherman to Gibson and to Glenvil Hall. Sherman sought a public flotation of Shermans Ltd but needed the permission of the Capital Issues Committee though neither politician was optimistic. Stanley also canvassed Key over some premises that he was attempting to sell to Sherman.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''91&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April, Stanley invited Belcher to stop by his Park Lane apartment. When he arrived he found Sherman. Belcher left angrily and later rebuked Stanley. Belcher decided to drop the prosecution against Sherman but the allocation of paper was now under his direct control and Sherman became still more insistent in seeking to increase his ration. Stanley continued to intercede on Sherman's behalf and Belcher agreed to meet with Sherman and the civil servant in charge of paper rationing on 24 June. At this meeting, Sherman revealed that he had been routinely exceeding his allocation. The government team were appalled and stopped the meeting indicating that they considered the matter a serious one and that an investigation would be inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''27–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the investigation could get under way, Sherman alleged that he had paid Stanley so that Stanley, in turn, could pay [[GBP]]2,500 each to Belcher and Sir [[Frank Soskice]], the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]]. Sherman also claimed that he had loaned GBP12,000 to Stanley, secured by a GBP27,000 [[cheque]] made out to Lass &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''29&lt;/ref&gt; The cheque turned out to be a forgery, made out on a stolen blank cheque.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''32&lt;/ref&gt; Appalled, and becoming increasingly aware that rumours were beginning to circulate, Belcher tried to warn Gibson but could not contact him. Senior civil servants had now become aware of the allegations and the police were involved. Belcher agreed that the [[Lord Chancellor]] [[William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt]] should be alerted and asked to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''33–34&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September, Belcher received a request from Jowitt that he provide a statement about his dealings with Stanley.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''36&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 October, the first rumours, though no names, appeared in the press.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stanley's arrest==
Jacob Harris was a supplier of amusement machines whose solicitor also acted for Stanley. The solicitor had originally met Stanley through [[service (law)|serving]] a bankruptcy notice on him and had ended up as his attorney. The original debtor never got paid. Stanley boasted of his surplus import licenses and the solicitor advised Harris whom he knew wanted to import [[pinball]] machines.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''72&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1948, Harris approached fellow supplier Francis Price with a proposal that they meet with Stanley. Stanley claimed that he could bribe Belcher and [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] Glenvil Hall to obtain licenses. After canvassing some commercial and political confidantes, Price contacted the police. Press speculation intensified.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''37–39&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 August, Stanley asked Gibson to write letters of introduction for his wife, who was about to leave for the US, to some of Gibson's trade union colleagues there. Gibson complied and Stanley used the letters to attempt to obtain from [[HM Treasury]] foreign currency above the usual allowance. Stanley's approach alerted officials to the possibility that he was about to flee the country.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''178&lt;/ref&gt; 27 August was also the day when Gibson sent a cheque for GBP500 to Stanley as deposit on a share offer in Gray's Carpets Ltd. Gibson heard nothing more from Stanley.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''172&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley was arrested on 18 October and held in [[Brixton Prison]]. Spartan though his surroundings were, he was able to order meals from a restaurant and pay another detainee for domestic duties.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''39–40&lt;/ref&gt; He was bailed on 21 October and returned to his Park Lane flat where his movements were restricted under the [[Aliens Order 1946]].&lt;ref&gt;SR&amp;O No.395. of 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

==The tribunal==
{{main|Lynskey tribunal}}
A tribunal was convened. Stanley, dapper in appearance, proved a self-important, self-aggrandising witness who amused the tribunal with his idiosyncratic, colourful, yet ambiguous and contradictory, responses to the questioning.&lt;ref name="Andrew 2009 p.361"/&gt; The tribunal found that Belcher and Gibson had acted improperly and they were fortunate to escape prosecution, gladly accepting the proffered alternative of resignation. [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]] Sir [[Hartley Shawcross]] expressed the opinion that Stanley could not be prosecuted as the notoriety he gained from the tribunal would inhibit a [[fair trial]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''232&lt;/ref&gt; The spying allegations were not raised in the tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew (2009) ''p.''362&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the tribunal==
On 23 December, Stanley applied for cancellation of his deportation order but was refused.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.'' 225&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Gibson and Belcher were resigning in disgrace, Stanley and his wife were enjoying their notoriety and celebrity, attending the [[Chelsea Arts Ball]] at New Year.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.'' 226&lt;/ref&gt;

In a debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 3 February 1949, Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] expressed the government view that Stanley should be deported as the deportation would be "conducive to the public good". Attlee was probably principally motivated by the spying allegations and Stanley's Zionist connections.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew (2009) ''p.'' 362&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the deportation order, the British government found that it could not deport Stanley, because no country was willing to receive him. He had lost citizenship in his home country of Poland, which was unwilling to take him in. Due to the changes in Poland's borders since [[World War II]], the Polish government required all Polish citizens to re-register home and abroad. Stanley had not done so, and in addition, the Polish Foreign Ministry announced that he would not be allowed to return. As a result, Stanley was rendered a [[statelessness|stateless person]], and could not be deported unless his country of origin or some other country was willing to receive him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19490217&amp;id=BwIaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-SMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3967,3950397 Britain Has Its Hands Full in Ousting of Stateless Man], February 17, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1949, Stanley applied for [[Israel]]i nationality. On 13 February, his application was rejected on the grounds that he was an undesirable. The Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' attacked Stanley as a Jew who "suddenly discovered his love for [[Zion]]" when in difficulties and there was speculation that Stanley had done his case no good when he criticised the conduct of the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] during his tribunal testimony. Stanley continued to entertain and enjoy his celebrity, despite continued calls for his deportation, while he was again pursued by the bankruptcy courts.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp'' 242–244&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley threatened to sue Israel for denying him entry, and empowered his lawyers in Israel to take action in court to get him an immigration visa. His lawyers in Israel argued that under the new state's proposed constitution, no Jew could be barred from immigrating to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19490212&amp;id=14Y0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RtwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6162,3671203 Jew Threatens to Sue to Get Into Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley was still required daily to report to police but reported for the last time on 1 April and an [[arrest warrant]] was issued. Stanley, it appears, drove to [[Ramsgate]], where a personal friend took him by sea to a port near [[Boulogne]] in France, possibly [[Dunkirk]]. He was taken from there by car to [[Abbeville]]. On 13 April, Israel announced that it would accept Stanley's application for an immigration visa and admit him to the country on the eve of [[Passover]] as "an act of grace and mercy". After about a month in France, Stanley travelled to [[Marseilles]], where he boarded the Israeli ship ''Atzmaut''. On 9 May, he arrived in [[Haifa]] aboard the ''Atzmaut'' together with about 2,000 other immigrants to Israel. He then held a press conference announcing that his name was now '''Shlomo Ben-Chaim'''. He made various claims regarding his disappearance, including that he had been kidnapped and held in France for a month, that he had escaped from Britain disguised as an admiral, and then as a military officer who became a passenger on a British destroyer. His lawyer, Max Seligman, said he was a "psychological case".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19490513&amp;id=RB0QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IZMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1590,1891857 Stanley Outstays His Welcome in Tel Aviv]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime later in 1949, Stanley returned to France with some thoughts of re-establishing himself in business, but moved back to Israel in 1950, where he spent the remainder of his life in obscurity, save for the wild allegations and stories that he continued to press on the newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp'' 244–250&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley died in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19690526&amp;id=VZZAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IqUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6215,4192005 Death of Sidney Stanley recalls 1949 scandal]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Silvio Denz Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Silvio Werner Denz]]

'''Silvio Werner Denz''' (born 14 September 1956 in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]) is a Swiss entrepreneur and collector of wine and art, currently living in Switzerland. He worked for various companies in Switzerland and the United States in finance, retail and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Valli Marie-Pierre. [http://www.lemonde.fr/journalelectronique/donnees/libre/20140411/index.html?cahier=LIV  "Silvio Denz épouse son temps"], ''[[Le Monde]]'', Paris, 2014-04-11 2014. Retrieved 2014-11-05.&lt;/ref&gt; He now operates mainly in the fields of luxury goods and wine. The Swiss business magazine ''Bilanz'' &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bilanz.ch/people/300-reichste&lt;/ref&gt; ranks him among the 300 wealthiest Swiss citizens and, more recently, among the 100 most important figures of the Swiss economy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bilanz.ch/people/luxus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneur==

===Perfume, cosmetics===
In 1980 Silvio Denz took over the management of [[Zurich]]-based Alrodo AG,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kolesnikov-Jessop Sonia |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/business/international/covering-the-skill-basics-at-big-companies.html?_r=0 |title=Covering the Skill Basics at Big Companies |publisher=International New York Times |date=2014-09-01 |accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; at that time was owned by his father and uncle. Initially with eight employees, the company purchased perfumes and cosmetics for imported perfumery retailers. After acquiring all the equity in Alrodo in 1984, he built up the company over the next 20 years to become Switzerland's largest perfumery chain, with 120 branches. Between 1980 and 2000, the number of employees rose from 8 to 800. In 2000 Denz sold Alrodo to the French perfumery chain Marionnaud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carole Bellemare |url= http://www.lefigaro.fr/decideurs/nomination/2015/10/21/33002-20151021ARTFIG00429-silvio-denz-l-esthete-et-epicurienqui-redonne-du-lustre-a-lalique.php |title=Silvio Denz, l'esthète et épicurienqui redonne du lustre à Lalique |publisher=Le Figaro |date=2015-10-21 |accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he founded Lalique Group (formerly known as Art &amp; Fragrance) specializing in the creation, production and marketing of perfume and cosmetic brands such as Perfumes [[Alain Delon]], [[Parfums Grès]], Perfumes Lalique, Jaguar Fragrances, Bentley Fragrances and Ultrasun.&lt;ref&gt;Bilanz 31 May 2005; "Silvio Denz: Rastloser Schlossherr"; by Corinne Amacher&lt;/ref&gt; The company has been listed on the stock exchange since 2007.

===Wine===
In 1994 Silvio Denz, along with Franz Wermuth and five other partners, founded Les Grand Vins Wermuth S.A., now split into Denz Weine (distribution) and Wermuth Auktionen AG (auctions)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wermuth.ch |title=Les Grands Vins Wermuth SA, Weinhandel, Weinauktionen |publisher=Wermuth.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Zurich. In 1998, acting with the same partners, he bought the Clos d'Agon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.closdagon.com |title=Clos d'Agon |publisher=Closdagon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; estate on the [[Costa Brava]], which is overseen by the oenologist [[Peter Sisseck]] ([[Dominio Pingus]]).

In 2005, on the recommendation of his friend Count Stephan von Neipperg ([[Château Canon-la-Gaffelière]] and [[La Mondotte]]), Denz bought the Château Faugères estate, six kilometers east of [[Saint Emilion]]. Faugères, which has 30 employees,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.châteaufaugeres.com{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; comprises three vineyards: Château Faugères, Château Péby Faugères, both lying in the Saint-Emilion appellation, and Château Cap-de-Faugères in Côtes de Castillion. In 2010, he and Peter Sisseck took over the vineyard of Château Rocheyron in Saint-Emilion. The estates in [[Bordeaux]] cover a total of 120 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;Schweizerische Weinzeitung; Ausgabe 3 März 2012;"Silvio Denz: Unternehmer und leidenschaftlicher Sammler von Weingütern"&lt;/ref&gt; Silvio Denz also owns the Montepeloso winery in Italy (which he acquired with Fabio Chiarelotto in 2007).

The winery at Château Faugères was designed by the architect [[Mario Botta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botta.ch |title=mario botta architetto |publisher=Botta.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sonntagszeitung; GenussTrend 18 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He describes his creation as a "cathedral of wine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/ |title=Actualité à la Une |publisher=Le Monde.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using modern technology coupled with traditional methods, such as gravity-filling, the wines are aged in oak barrels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srf.ch/player/tv/cash-tv/video/cash-tv-vom-01-04-2012?id=f31eada9-0218-4cc3-bb6e-f8263bcbfa36 |title=cash TV vom 01.04.2012 - cash TV - TV - SRF Player - Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen |publisher=Srf.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225201746/http://www.srf.ch/player/tv/cash-tv/video/cash-tv-vom-01-04-2012?id=f31eada9-0218-4cc3-bb6e-f8263bcbfa36 |archivedate=25 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Château Faugères and Château Péby Faugères were awarded the status of Grand Cru Classé of Saint-Emilion.

Silvio Denz's wine businesses are held in Art &amp; Terroir.

On September 17, 2017, Silvio Denz was inducted as a Saint-Emilion Jurat.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.vins-saint-emilion.com/about/jurade-saint-emilion Sain-Emilion Jurat&lt;/ref&gt; The Jurade of Saint-Emilion currently consists of 127 Jurats and more than 3000 Saint-Emilion wine ambassadors worldwide.

'''Supplier risk management''' (SRM) is an evolving discipline in operations management for manufacturers, retailers, financial services companies and government agencies where the organization is highly dependent on suppliers to achieve business objectives.  

The complexity and globally outsourced nature of today’s supply chains combined with the practice of optimization techniques such as lean and just-in-time manufacturing in order to improve efficiency has increased supply chain vulnerabilities to even minor supply disruptions. While these models have allowed companies to reduce overall costs and expand quickly into new markets, they also expose the company to the risk of a supplier suddenly going bankrupt, closing operations, data breach&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.preparis.com/blog/third-party-vendors-greatest-cyber-risk/|title=Third Party Vendors Could Be Your Greatest Cyber Risk - Preparis|website=www.preparis.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; or being acquired. Among the several types of supply disruptions, most severe are those that have a relatively low probability of occurrence with a very high severity of impact when they do occur. While such risks cannot be eliminated, however, its severity can be reduced.


==Objectives==
To overcome these challenges, companies mitigate [[Supply chain risk management|supply chain interruptions]] and reduce risk with strategies and tactics that address supplier-centric risk at multiple stages in the relationship: 

* On boarding: Bringing suppliers into the operation with registration that includes:
** A centralized supplier registration portal
** Integration of third party performance, financial data and predictive indicators into the supplier profile 
* Monitoring for stability beyond financial data, including:
** Criminal and terrorists (i.e. [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]]) ties and operational performance
** Visibility into potential disruptions caused by geopolitical threats, acts of nature, etc. 
* Cultivating strategic supplier relationships for the long-term:
** Leverage supplier scorecards for continuous improvement 
** Establish and use benchmarks for measuring supplier performance 
** Creating a system for collaboration and supplier development 
* Establish control across the extended enterprise: 
** Create integrated supplier networks
** Extend performance management benchmarks to second and third tier suppliers 

== Supplier risk in recession and recovery ==

In 2008-2009, manufacturers experienced the startling speed at which suppliers can move from stability to shutting down operations. The devastating impact of a crucial supplier failure has moved [[risk management]] from add-on service to mission-critical.  With a new focus on risk management, manufacturers have seen value whether the economy is stagnant or thriving.  

With a transparent, accessible and comprehensive set of supplier information, manufacturers have been able to monitor suppliers for behavioral changes which contribute to overall stability, including: 
* Changes in the supplier’s management team 
* EPA violations
* OSHA incidents
* Quality issues
* Noticeable lags in response time to inquiries 
* OFAC violations 

Changes in any of these conditions can be defined as parameters for raising an alert. For example, a financially stable supplier may in fact be about to lose it [[CEO]] to retirement – which may cause issues within the management team. Early visibility into that change gives the manufacturer time to ensure it doesn’t negatively affect customers.  

Based on the criticality of the supplier and the nature of the alert received, the manufacturer can then choose to take necessary action, such as calling or visiting the supplier, increasing monitoring, or moving towards terminating the relationship with the supplier and finding a replacement.

== Benefits ==

Reducing supplier risk can: 
* Give insight to manufacturers to create defensive and offensive strategies that turn risk into a [[Competitiveness|competitive advantage]]. 
* Help determine whether or not it is beneficial for a company to conduct a customer intervention and know in advance what the potential outcomes might be for an intervention.
* Improve competitive position in the market.
* Lower supplier costs.
* Position manufacturers to better address customer needs by addressing supplier vulnerabilities before they become apparent.
* Prevent loss of customer's trust due to [https://www.upguard.com/breaches/topic/data-breaches data exposure] or [http://fortune.com/2016/09/26/swift-hack/ systems being hacked].

==Early life==
Originally from [[Fujian]] province in [[China]], Yu and his family moved to the Philippines at a young age. He began making a living in [[Camarines Norte]] through selling bread buns in the streets and doing some fishing. He graduated from [[University of St. La Salle]] in [[Bacolod City]], and in 1997, received an honorary doctorate of science degree from the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CNN Asiaweek interview|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/96/0202/biz2.html|newspaper=CNN Asiaweek|date=2000-11-30|access-date=2012-02-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109084859/http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/96/0202/biz2.html#|archive-date=2014-01-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of 18, he had established a successful textile business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tycoon, Philanthropist Tan Yu dies at 75|url=http://www.newsflash.org/2002/03/hl/hl015377.htm|newspaper=Philippine Headline News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tradespace''' has three related meanings:
#As a multi-variant mathematical playspace used for identifying the optimal boundary spaces (the [[Pareto frontier]]) where the multiple variants have strong interdependencies.  The term, Tradespace, is a combination of the words  “trade-off” and “playspace”, where “trade-off” indicates the method of traversing the Tradespace in search of the optimal boundary space (e.g., trading off a cost in one cost center (variant A) for a cost in another cost center (variant B)).   Tradespace analysis is used in this context by NASA, DARPA and MIT for analyzing the complex resource, costs and provisioning involved in large projects with multiple stakeholders and multiple objectives.
#As a collection of processes spanning multiple organizations.  “Tradespace” in this context is used to distinguish the difference between '''intra'''-corporate process management and '''inter'''-corporate process management (although it may include (not exclusively) intra-corporate, inter-departmental processes).  This type of Tradespace shares business processes and human resources across the system resulting in a collection of business processes spanning corporate or departmental boundaries.  The term Tradespace was first applied in this context in 2003 by QBOS, Inc. as a way of signifying the relevance of the term in its above context to the search for equilibria (the [[Pareto frontier]]) in a collection of processes spanning multiple organizations where those organizations each have their own seven-sigma core objectives.  The relevance of the term as a collection of inter-corporate processes to its meaning as a multi-variant interdependent playspace becomes very apparent when observing organizations working together in a Tradespace via processes put in place between the organizations.  Their at-first-glance independent objectives take on an interdependency similar to the multi-variant models in the mathematical use of the term.  Thus, the very act of creating inter-corporate processes creates an interdependency that must be explored and managed in order to reach an equilibrium state that is stable, resilient and maximizes opportunity and ROI for the participant organizations (see Tradespace Management System).  Multiple Tradespaces of this type may aggregate to form larger Tradespaces of this type.
#In a financial sense as an environment for supporting inter-corporate financial exchange transactions.  This form of the term was instantiated by NextSet Software, Inc. in 2000.

Multiple Tradespaces of context type 2 or 3, above, may aggregate to form larger Tradespaces of the same type.
Merging Tradespaces of both types (2 and 3) results in an [[business ecosystem|eco-system]].  Distinctions between Tradespaces and eco-systems include:

#Tradespaces can give rise to strong eco-systems but not the other way around and
#By focusing on either the analysis of inter-corporate processes (context 2 above) or the analysis of inter-corporate funds exchange (context 3 above), Tradespaces form natural boundary interfaces matching the [[cash flow / provisioning interface]] and thus protect against the anomalies that can arise in a poorly designed cash-flow/provisioning interface.  Eco-systems that are not designed on a Tradespace foundation model first, run the risk of dissolution due to anomalies created by the [[cash flow / provisioning interface]].

'''WRCA''' (1330 [[Hertz|kHz]]) is a commercial [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[radio station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Watertown, Massachusetts]] and serving the [[Greater Boston]] [[media market]].  The license is held by the Beasley Media Group, LLC, part of the [[Beasley Broadcast Group]], Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&amp;appn=101202509&amp;formid=323&amp;fac_num=0 FCC Station Ownership database]&lt;/ref&gt; The station carries financial news from [[Bloomberg Radio]] with some local news, weather and traffic reports. WRCA's programming is also heard on [[Broadcast translator|FM translator]] '''W291CZ''' (106.1&amp;nbsp;MHz) and on the HD2 channel of sister station [[WBOS]].

==History==
[[File:WRCA1330.png|thumb|left|Logo for the station prior to November 15, 2016]]
The station began operating as '''WCRB''' on January 30, 1948, owned by Theodore Jones's [[Charles River Broadcasting]] (hence the W'''CRB''' [[call sign|call letters]]).  WCRB was originally a community radio station for [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], before switching to a [[classical music]] format a few years later.  An FM [[simulcast]] was added in 1954, [[WCRB]]-FM.  As FM broadcasting became more popular for music listening, the AM station ceased simulcasting WCRB-FM's classical format in 1975 and became '''WHET''', programming a [[big band]]/[[adult standards]] format from 1975 until 1978, and then a short run as a [[beautiful music]] outlet.  Sales of the station to various owners led to formats such as [[country music]] '''WDLW''' for most of the 1980s, and then ''"Showbiz Radio"'' '''WRCA''' (standing for "Radio, Comedy, and Arts") in 1990 before the station began [[brokered programming|leasing time]] to ethnic broadcasters in 1991 with the WRCA [[call sign]] retained.  The current owners, the [[Beasley Broadcast Group]], took over in 2000 from the ADD Radio Group.

The station's long time [[transmitter]] site in Waltham was discontinued in 2007 when WRCA became one of three AM stations to share a rebuilt transmitter facility at the original site of [[WUNR|WBOS]] [[AM 1600]] on Sawmill Brook Parkway in [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]].  This site is now used by stations on 1200, 1330 and 1600&amp;nbsp;kHz.

WRCA's [[city of license]] changed from Waltham to Watertown in 2007, and the power increased to 25,000&amp;nbsp;watts daytime, 17,000&amp;nbsp;watts nighttime.  In addition to ethnic programming, WRCA had broadcast [[Northeastern Huskies men's ice hockey]] games.

Following Beasley's acquisition of [[Greater Media]], WRCA went [[dark (broadcasting)|dark]] on November 15, 2016, as it moved to new studios; it returned in May 2017 with a simulcast of "Boston's Irish Channel", the HD2 channel of sister station [[WBQT (FM)|WBQT]], as it was believed that WRCA was in the process of signal testing.  The station was also paired with an [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[broadcast relay station|translator]], '''W291CZ''' (licensed to [[Boston]]) at 106.1 [[Hertz|MHz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://radio-locator.com/info/W291CZ-FX Radio-Locator]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 2017, [[Bloomberg L.P.]] and Beasley announced that WRCA/W291CZ would begin carrying [[Bloomberg Radio]] programming (which moved over from [[WXKS (AM)|WXKS]]) beginning the following day. Concurrently, the HD2 channel of [[WBOS]] began to simulcast WRCA's programming.&lt;ref&gt;[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/118668/bloomberg-moving-1330106-1-boston/  Bloomberg Radio Moving to 1330/106.1 Boston]&lt;/ref&gt;
